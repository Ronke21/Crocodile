<text>Ploidy () is the number of complete sets of chromosomes in a cell, and hence the number of possible alleles for autosomal and pseudoautosomal genes. Here &quot;sets of chromosomes&quot; refers to the number of maternal and paternal chromosome copies, respectively, in each homologous chromosome pair—the form in which chromosomes naturally exist. Somatic cells, tissues, and individual organisms can be described according to the number of sets of chromosomes present (the &quot;ploidy level&quot;): monoploid (1 set), diploid (2 sets), triploid (3 sets), tetraploid (4 sets), pentaploid (5 sets), hexaploid (6 sets), heptaploid or septaploid (7 sets), etc. The generic term polyploid is often used to describe cells with three or more sets of chromosomes.

Virtually all sexually reproducing organisms are made up of somatic cells that are diploid or greater, but ploidy level may vary widely between different organisms, between different tissues within the same organism, and at different stages in an organism&#x27;s life cycle. Half of all known plant genera contain polyploid species, and about two-thirds of all grasses are polyploid. Many animals are uniformly diploid, though polyploidy is common in invertebrates, reptiles, and amphibians. In some species, ploidy varies between individuals of the same species (as in the social insects), and in others entire tissues and organ systems may be polyploid despite the rest of the body being diploid (as in the mammalian liver). For many organisms, especially plants and fungi, changes in ploidy level between generations are major drivers of speciation. In mammals and birds, ploidy changes are typically fatal. There is, however, evidence of polyploidy in organisms now considered to be diploid, suggesting that polyploidy has contributed to evolutionary diversification in plants and animals through successive rounds of polyploidization and rediploidization.

Humans are diploid organisms, normally carrying two complete sets of chromosomes in their somatic cells: one copy of paternal and maternal chromosomes, respectively, in each of the 23 homologous pairs of chromosomes that humans normally have. This results in two homologous pairs within each of the 23 homologous pairs, providing a full complement of 46 chromosomes. This total number of individual chromosomes (counting all complete sets) is called the chromosome number or chromosome complement. The number of chromosomes found in a single complete set of chromosomes is called the monoploid number (&quot;x&quot;). The haploid number (&quot;n&quot;) refers to the total number of chromosomes found in a gamete (a sperm or egg cell produced by meiosis in preparation for sexual reproduction). Under normal conditions, the haploid number is exactly half the total number of chromosomes present in the organism&#x27;s somatic cells, with one paternal and maternal copy in each chromosome pair. For diploid organisms, the monoploid number and haploid number are equal; in humans, both are equal to 23. When a human germ cell undergoes meiosis, the diploid 46 chromosome complement is split in half to form haploid gametes. After fusion of a male and a female gamete (each containing 1 set of 23 chromosomes) during fertilization, the resulting zygote again has the full complement of 46 chromosomes: 2 sets of 23 chromosomes. Euploidy and aneuploidy describe having a number of chromosomes that is an exact multiple of the number of chromosomes in a normal gamete; and having any other number, respectively. For example, a person with Turner syndrome may be missing one sex chromosome (X or Y), resulting in a (45,X) karyotype instead of the usual (46,XX) or (46,XY). This is a type of aneuploidy and cells from the person may be said to be aneuploid with a (diploid) chromosome complement of 45.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;ploidy&quot; is a back-formation from &quot;haploidy&quot; and &quot;diploidy&quot;. &quot;Ploid&quot; is a combination of Ancient Greek -πλόος (-plóos, &quot;-fold&quot;) and -ειδής (-&quot;eidḗs&quot;), from εἶδος (&quot;eîdos&quot;, &quot;form, likeness&quot;). The principal meaning of the Greek word ᾰ̔πλόος (haplóos) is &quot;single&quot;, from ἁ- (ha-, &quot;one, same&quot;). διπλόος (&quot;diplóos&quot;) means &quot;duplex&quot; or &quot;two-fold&quot;. Diploid therefore means &quot;duplex-shaped&quot; (compare &quot;humanoid&quot;, &quot;human-shaped&quot;).

Polish-German botanist Eduard Strasburger coined the terms &quot;haploid&quot; and &quot;diploid&quot; in 1905. Some authors suggest that Strasburger based the terms on August Weismann&#x27;s conception of the id (or germ plasm), hence haplo-&quot;id&quot; and diplo-&quot;id&quot;. The two terms were brought into the English language from German through William Henry Lang&#x27;s 1908 translation of a 1906 textbook by Strasburger and colleagues.

==Types of ploidy==

===Haploid and monoploid===
The term haploid is used with two distinct but related definitions. In the most generic sense, haploid refers to having the number of sets of chromosomes normally found in a gamete. Because two gametes necessarily combine during sexual reproduction to form a single zygote from which somatic cells are generated, healthy gametes always possess exactly half the number of sets of chromosomes found in the somatic cells, and therefore &quot;haploid&quot; in this sense refers to having exactly half the number of sets of chromosomes found in a somatic cell. By this definition, an organism whose gametic cells contain a single copy of each chromosome (one set of chromosomes) may be considered haploid while the somatic cells, containing two copies of each chromosome (two sets of chromosomes), are diploid. This scheme of diploid somatic cells and haploid gametes is widely used in the animal kingdom and is the simplest to illustrate in diagrams of genetics concepts. But this definition also allows for haploid gametes with &quot;more than one&quot; set of chromosomes. As given above, gametes are by definition haploid, regardless of the actual number of sets of chromosomes they contain. An organism whose somatic cells are tetraploid (four sets of chromosomes), for example, will produce gametes by meiosis that contain two sets of chromosomes. These gametes might still be called haploid even though they are numerically diploid.

An alternative usage defines &quot;haploid&quot; as having a single copy of each chromosome – that is, one and only one set of chromosomes. In this case, the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell is said to be haploid only if it has a single set of chromosomes, each one not being part of a pair. By extension a cell may be called haploid if its nucleus has one set of chromosomes, and an organism may be called haploid if its body cells (somatic cells) have one set of chromosomes per cell. By this definition haploid therefore would not be used to refer to the gametes produced by the tetraploid organism in the example above, since these gametes are numerically diploid. The term monoploid is often used as a less ambiguous way to describe a single set of chromosomes; by this second definition, haploid and monoploid are identical and can be used interchangeably.

Gametes (sperm and ova) are haploid cells. The haploid gametes produced by most organisms combine to form a zygote with &quot;n&quot; pairs of chromosomes, i.e. 2&quot;n&quot; chromosomes in total. The chromosomes in each pair, one of which comes from the sperm and one from the egg, are said to be homologous. Cells and organisms with pairs of homologous chromosomes are called diploid. For example, most animals are diploid and produce haploid gametes. During meiosis, sex cell precursors have their number of chromosomes halved by randomly &quot;choosing&quot; one member of each pair of chromosomes, resulting in haploid gametes. Because homologous chromosomes usually differ genetically, gametes usually differ genetically from one another.

All plants and many fungi and algae switch between a haploid and a diploid state, with one of the stages emphasized over the other. This is called alternation of generations. Most fungi and algae are haploid during the principal stage of their life cycle, as are some primitive plants like mosses. More recently evolved plants, like the gymnosperms and angiosperms, spend the majority of their life cycle in the diploid stage. Most animals are diploid, but male bees, wasps, and ants are haploid organisms because they develop from unfertilized, haploid eggs, while females (workers and queens) are diploid, making their system haplodiploid.

In some cases there is evidence that the &quot;n&quot; chromosomes in a haploid set have resulted from duplications of an originally smaller set of chromosomes. This &quot;base&quot; number – the number of apparently originally unique chromosomes in a haploid set – is called the monoploid number, also known as basic or cardinal number, or fundamental number. As an example, the chromosomes of common wheat are believed to be derived from three different ancestral species, each of which had 7 chromosomes in its haploid gametes. The monoploid number is thus 7 and the haploid number is 3 × 7 = 21. In general &quot;n&quot; is a multiple of &quot;x&quot;. The somatic cells in a wheat plant have six sets of 7 chromosomes: three sets from the egg and three sets from the sperm which fused to form the plant, giving a total of 42 chromosomes. As a formula, for wheat 2&quot;n&quot; = 6&quot;x&quot; = 42, so that the haploid number &quot;n&quot; is 21 and the monoploid number &quot;x&quot; is 7. The gametes of common wheat are considered to be haploid, since they contain half the genetic information of somatic cells, but they are not monoploid, as they still contain three complete sets of chromosomes (&quot;n&quot; = 3&quot;x&quot;).

In the case of wheat, the origin of its haploid number of 21 chromosomes from three sets of 7 chromosomes can be demonstrated. In many other organisms, although the number of chromosomes may have originated in this way, this is no longer clear, and the monoploid number is regarded as the same as the haploid number. Thus in humans, &quot;x&quot; = &quot;n&quot; = 23.

=== Diploid ===
Diploid describes a cell or nucleus which contains two copies of genetic material, or a complete set of chromosomes, paired with their homologs (chromosome carrying the same information from the other parent).
Diploid cells have two homologous copies of each chromosome, usually one from the mother and one from the father. All or nearly all mammals are diploid organisms. The suspected tetraploid (possessing four-chromosome sets) plains viscacha rat (&quot;Tympanoctomys barrerae&quot;) and golden viscacha rat (&quot;Pipanacoctomys aureus&quot;) have been regarded as the only known exceptions (as of 2004). However, some genetic studies have rejected any polyploidism in mammals as unlikely, and suggest that amplification and dispersion of repetitive sequences best explain the large genome size of these two rodents. All normal diploid individuals have some small fraction of cells that display polyploidy. Human diploid cells have 46 chromosomes (the somatic number, &quot;2n&quot;) and human haploid gametes (egg and sperm) have 23 chromosomes (&quot;n&quot;). Retroviruses that contain two copies of their RNA genome in each viral particle are also said to be diploid. Examples include human foamy virus, human T-lymphotropic virus, and HIV.

=== Polyploidy ===

Polyploidy is the state where all cells have multiple sets of chromosomes beyond the basic set, usually 3 or more. Specific terms are triploid (3 sets), tetraploid (4 sets), pentaploid (5 sets), hexaploid (6 sets), heptaploid or septaploid (7 sets), octoploid (8 sets), nonaploid (9 sets), decaploid (10 sets), undecaploid (11 sets), dodecaploid (12 sets), tridecaploid (13 sets), tetradecaploid (14 sets), etc. Some higher ploidies include hexadecaploid (16 sets), dotriacontaploid (32 sets), and tetrahexacontaploid (64 sets), though Greek terminology may be set aside for readability in cases of higher ploidy (such as &quot;16-ploid&quot;). Polytene chromosomes of plants and fruit flies can be 1024-ploid. Ploidy of systems such as the salivary gland, elaiosome, endosperm, and trophoblast can exceed this, up to 1048576-ploid in the silk glands of the commercial silkworm &quot;Bombyx mori&quot;.

The chromosome sets may be from the same species or from closely related species. In the latter case, these are known as allopolyploids (or amphidiploids, which are allopolyploids that behave as if they were normal diploids). Allopolyploids are formed from the hybridization of two separate species. In plants, this probably most often occurs from the pairing of meiotically unreduced gametes, and not by diploid–diploid hybridization followed by chromosome doubling. The so-called &quot;Brassica&quot; triangle is an example of allopolyploidy, where three different parent species have hybridized in all possible pair combinations to produce three new species.

Polyploidy occurs commonly in plants, but rarely in animals. Even in diploid organisms, many somatic cells are polyploid due to a process called endoreduplication, where duplication of the genome occurs without mitosis (cell division). The extreme in polyploidy occurs in the fern genus &quot;Ophioglossum&quot;, the adder&#x27;s-tongues, in which polyploidy results in chromosome counts in the hundreds, or, in at least one case, well over one thousand.

It is possible for polyploid organisms to revert to lower ploidy by haploidisation.

====In bacteria and archaea====
Polyploidy is a characteristic of the bacterium &quot;Deinococcus radiodurans&quot; and of the archaeon &quot;Halobacterium salinarum&quot;. These two species are highly resistant to ionizing radiation and desiccation, conditions that induce DNA double-strand breaks. This resistance appears to be due to efficient homologous recombinational repair.

===Variable or indefinite ploidy===
Depending on growth conditions, prokaryotes such as bacteria may have a chromosome copy number of 1 to 4, and that number is commonly fractional, counting portions of the chromosome partly replicated at a given time. This is because under exponential growth conditions the cells are able to replicate their DNA faster than they can divide.

In ciliates, the macronucleus is called ampliploid, because only part of the genome is amplified.

===Mixoploidy===
Mixoploidy is the case where two cell lines, one diploid and one polyploid, coexist within the same organism. Though polyploidy in humans is not viable, mixoploidy has been found in live adults and children. There are two types: diploid-triploid mixoploidy, in which some cells have 46 chromosomes and some have 69, and diploid-tetraploid mixoploidy, in which some cells have 46 and some have 92 chromosomes. It is a major topic of cytology.

===Dihaploidy and polyhaploidy===

Dihaploid and polyhaploid cells are formed by haploidisation of polyploids, i.e., by halving the chromosome constitution.

Dihaploids (which are diploid) are important for selective breeding of tetraploid crop plants (notably potatoes), because selection is faster with diploids than with tetraploids. Tetraploids can be reconstituted from the diploids, for example by somatic fusion.

The term &quot;dihaploid&quot; was coined by Bender to combine in one word the number of genome copies (diploid) and their origin (haploid). The term is well established in this original sense, but it has also been used for doubled monoploids or doubled haploids, which are homozygous and used for genetic research.

===Euploidy and aneuploidy===
Euploidy (Greek &quot;eu&quot;, &quot;true&quot; or &quot;even&quot;) is the state of a cell or organism having one or more than one set of the same set of chromosomes, possibly excluding the sex-determining chromosomes. For example, most human cells have 2 of each of the 23 homologous monoploid chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes. A human cell with one extra set of the 23 normal chromosomes (functionally triploid) would be considered euploid. Euploid karyotypes would consequentially be a multiple of the haploid number, which in humans is 23.

Aneuploidy is the state where one or more individual chromosomes of a normal set are absent or present in more than their usual number of copies (excluding the absence or presence of complete sets, which is considered euploidy). Unlike euploidy, aneuploid karyotypes will not be a multiple of the haploid number. In humans, examples of aneuploidy include having a single extra chromosome (as in Down syndrome, where affected individuals have three copies of chromosome 21) or missing a chromosome (as in Turner syndrome, where affected individuals have only one sex chromosome). Aneuploid karyotypes are given names with the suffix &quot;-somy&quot; (rather than &quot;-ploidy&quot;, used for euploid karyotypes), such as trisomy and monosomy.

===Homoploid===
Homoploid means &quot;at the same ploidy level&quot;, i.e. having the same number of homologous chromosomes. For example, homoploid hybridization is hybridization where the offspring have the same ploidy level as the two parental species. This contrasts with a common situation in plants where chromosome doubling accompanies or occurs soon after hybridization. Similarly, homoploid speciation contrasts with polyploid speciation.

===Zygoidy and azygoidy===
Zygoidy is the state in which the chromosomes are paired and can undergo meiosis. The zygoid state of a species may be diploid or polyploid. In the azygoid state the chromosomes are unpaired. It may be the natural state of some asexual species or may occur after meiosis. In diploid organisms the azygoid state is monoploid. (See below for dihaploidy.)

==Special cases==

===More than one nucleus per cell===
In the strictest sense, ploidy refers to the number of sets of chromosomes in a single nucleus rather than in the cell as a whole. Because in most situations there is only one nucleus per cell, it is commonplace to speak of the ploidy of a cell, but in cases in which there is more than one nucleus per cell, more specific definitions are required when ploidy is discussed. Authors may at times report the total combined ploidy of all nuclei present within the cell membrane of a syncytium, though usually the ploidy of each nucleus is described individually. For example, a fungal dikaryon with two separate haploid nuclei is distinguished from a diploid cell in which the chromosomes share a nucleus and can be shuffled together.

===Ancestral ploidy levels===
It is possible on rare occasions for ploidy to increase in the germline, which can result in polyploid offspring and ultimately polyploid species. This is an important evolutionary mechanism in both plants and animals and is known as a primary driver of speciation. As a result, it may become desirable to distinguish between the ploidy of a species or variety as it presently breeds and that of an ancestor. The number of chromosomes in the ancestral (non-homologous) set is called the monoploid number (&quot;x&quot;), and is distinct from the haploid number (&quot;n&quot;) in the organism as it now reproduces.

Common wheat (&quot;Triticum aestivum&quot;) is an organism in which &quot;x&quot; and &quot;n&quot; differ. Each plant has a total of six sets of chromosomes (with two sets likely having been obtained from each of three different diploid species that are its distant ancestors). The somatic cells are hexaploid, 2&quot;n&quot; = 6&quot;x&quot; = 42 (where the monoploid number &quot;x&quot; = 7 and the haploid number &quot;n&quot; = 21). The gametes are haploid for their own species, but triploid, with three sets of chromosomes, by comparison to a probable evolutionary ancestor, einkorn wheat.

Tetraploidy (four sets of chromosomes, 2&quot;n&quot; = 4&quot;x&quot;) is common in many plant species, and also occurs in amphibians, reptiles, and insects. For example, species of &quot;Xenopus&quot; (African toads) form a ploidy series, featuring diploid (&quot;X. tropicalis&quot;, 2n=20), tetraploid (&quot;X. laevis&quot;, 4n=36), octaploid (&quot;X. wittei&quot;, 8n=72), and dodecaploid (&quot;X. ruwenzoriensis&quot;, 12n=108) species.

Over evolutionary time scales in which chromosomal polymorphisms accumulate, these changes become less apparent by karyotype – for example, humans are generally regarded as diploid, but the 2R hypothesis has confirmed two rounds of whole genome duplication in early vertebrate ancestors.

===Haplodiploidy===
Ploidy can also vary between individuals of the same species or at different stages of the life cycle. In some insects it differs by caste. In humans, only the gametes are haploid, but in many of the social insects, including ants, bees, and termites, males develop from unfertilized eggs, making them haploid for their entire lives, even as adults.

In the Australian bulldog ant, &quot;Myrmecia pilosula&quot;, a haplodiploid species, haploid individuals of this species have a single chromosome and diploid individuals have two chromosomes. In &quot;Entamoeba&quot;, the ploidy level varies from 4&quot;n&quot; to 40&quot;n&quot; in a single population. Alternation of generations occurs in most plants, with individuals &quot;alternating&quot; ploidy level between different stages of their sexual life cycle.

===Tissue-specific polyploidy===
In large multicellular organisms, variations in ploidy level between different tissues, organs, or cell lineages are common. Because the chromosome number is generally reduced only by the specialized process of meiosis, the somatic cells of the body inherit and maintain the chromosome number of the zygote by mitosis. However, in many situations somatic cells double their copy number by means of endoreduplication as an aspect of cellular differentiation. For example, the hearts of two-year-old human children contain 85% diploid and 15% tetraploid nuclei, but by 12 years of age the proportions become approximately equal, and adults examined contained 27% diploid, 71% tetraploid and 2% octaploid nuclei.

== Adaptive and ecological significance of variation in ploidy ==
There is continued study and debate regarding the fitness advantages or disadvantages conferred by different ploidy levels. A study comparing the karyotypes of endangered or invasive plants with those of their relatives found that being polyploid as opposed to diploid is associated with a 14% lower risk of being endangered, and a 20% greater chance of being invasive. Polyploidy may be associated with increased vigor and adaptability. Some studies suggest that selection is more likely to favor diploidy in host species and haploidy in parasite species. However, polyploidization is associated with an increase in transposable element content and relaxed purifying selection on recessive deleterious alleles.

When a germ cell with an uneven number of chromosomes undergoes meiosis, the chromosomes cannot be evenly divided between the daughter cells, resulting in aneuploid gametes. Triploid organisms, for instance, are usually sterile. Because of this, triploidy is commonly exploited in agriculture to produce seedless fruit such as bananas and watermelons. If the fertilization of human gametes results in three sets of chromosomes, the condition is called triploid syndrome.

In unicellular organisms the ploidy nutrient limitation hypothesis suggests that nutrient limitation should encourage haploidy in preference to higher ploidies. This hypothesis is due to the higher surface-to-volume ratio of haploids, which eases nutrient uptake, thereby increasing the internal nutrient-to-demand ratio. Mable 2001 finds &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; to be somewhat inconsistent with this hypothesis however, as haploid growth is faster than diploid under high nutrient conditions. The NLH is also tested in haploid, diploid, and polyploid fungi by Gerstein et al. 2017. This result is also more complex: On the one hand, under phosphorus and other nutrient limitation, lower ploidy is selected as expected. However under normal nutrient levels or under limitation of only nitrogen, higher ploidy was selected. Thus the NLH and more generally, the idea that haploidy is selected by harsher conditions is cast into doubt by these results.

Older WGDs have also been investigated. Only as recently as 2015 was the ancient whole genome duplication in Baker&#x27;s yeast proven to be allopolyploid, by Marcet-Houben and Gabaldón 2015. It still remains to be explained why there are not more polyploid events in fungi, and the place of neopolyploidy and mesopolyploidy in fungal history.

==Less efficient natural selection in diploid compared to haploid tissue==

The concept that those genes of an organism that are expressed exclusively in the diploid stage are under less efficient natural selection than those genes expressed in the haploid stage is referred to as the “masking theory”. Evidence in support of this masking theory has been reported in studies of the single-celled yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;. In further support of the masking theory, evidence of strong purifying selection in haploid tissue-specific genes has been reported for the plant Scots Pine.

==Glossary of ploidy numbers==
The common potato (&quot;Solanum tuberosum&quot;) is an example of a tetraploid organism, carrying four sets of chromosomes. During sexual reproduction, each potato plant inherits two sets of 12 chromosomes from the pollen parent, and two sets of 12 chromosomes from the ovule parent. The four sets combined provide a full complement of 48 chromosomes. The haploid number (half of 48) is 24. The monoploid number equals the total chromosome number divided by the ploidy level of the somatic cells: 48 chromosomes in total divided by a ploidy level of 4 equals a monoploid number of 12. Hence, the monoploid number (12) and haploid number (24) are distinct in this example.

However, commercial potato crops (as well as many other crop plants) are commonly propagated vegetatively (by asexual reproduction through mitosis), in which case new individuals are produced from a single parent, without the involvement of gametes and fertilization, and all the offspring are genetically identical to each other and to the parent, including in chromosome number. The parents of these vegetative clones may still be capable of producing haploid gametes in preparation for sexual reproduction, but these gametes are not used to create the vegetative offspring by this route.

<text>Playboy (stylized in all caps) is an American men&#x27;s lifestyle and entertainment magazine, formerly in print and online since 2020. It was founded in Chicago in 1953 by Hugh Hefner and his associates, funded in part by a $1,000 loan from Hefner&#x27;s mother.

Known for its centerfolds of nude and semi-nude models (Playmates), &quot;Playboy&quot; played an important role in the sexual revolution and remains one of the world&#x27;s best-known brands, with a presence in nearly every medium. In addition to the flagship magazine in the United States, special nation-specific versions of &quot;Playboy&quot; are published worldwide, including those by licensees, such as Dirk Steenekamp&#x27;s DHS Media Group.

The magazine has a long history of publishing short stories by novelists such as Arthur C. Clarke, Ian Fleming, Vladimir Nabokov, Saul Bellow, Chuck Palahniuk, P. G. Wodehouse, Roald Dahl, Haruki Murakami, and Margaret Atwood. With a regular display of full-page color cartoons, it became a showcase for cartoonists such as Jack Cole, Eldon Dedini, Jules Feiffer, Harvey Kurtzman, Shel Silverstein, Doug Sneyd, Erich Sokol, Roy Raymonde, Gahan Wilson, and Rowland B. Wilson. Art Paul designed the bunny logo. Leroy Neiman drew the Femlin characters for Playboy jokes. Patrick Nagel painted the headers for Playboy Forum and other sections.

&quot;Playboy&quot; features monthly interviews of public figures, such as artists, architects, economists, composers, conductors, film directors, journalists, novelists, playwrights, religious figures, politicians, athletes, and race car drivers. The magazine generally reflects a liberal editorial stance, although it often interviews conservative celebrities.

After a year-long removal of most nude photos in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, the March–April 2017 issue brought back nudity.

==Publication history==

===1950s===

By spring 1953, Hugh Hefner—a 1949 University of Illinois psychology graduate who had worked in Chicago for &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine writing promotional copy; Publisher&#x27;s Development Corporation in sales and marketing; and &quot;Children&#x27;s Activities&quot; magazine as circulation promotions manager—had planned out the elements of his magazine, that he would call &quot;Stag Party&quot;. He formed HMH Publishing Corporation, and recruited his friend Eldon Sellers to find investors. Hefner eventually raised just over $8,000, including from his brother and mother. However, the publisher of an unrelated men&#x27;s adventure magazine, &quot;Stag&quot;, contacted Hefner and informed him it would file suit to protect their trademark if he were to launch his magazine with that name. Hefner, his wife Millie, and Sellers met to seek a new name, considering &quot;Top Hat&quot;, &quot;Gentleman&quot;, &quot;Sir&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Satyr&quot;, &quot;Pan&quot;, and &quot;Bachelor&quot; before Sellers suggested &quot;Playboy&quot;.

Published in December 1953, the first issue was undated, as Hefner was unsure there would be a second. He produced it in his Hyde Park kitchen. The first centerfold was Marilyn Monroe, although the picture used initially was taken for a calendar rather than for &quot;Playboy&quot;. Hefner chose what he deemed the &quot;sexiest&quot; image, a previously unused nude study of Monroe stretched with an upraised arm on a red velvet background with closed eyes and mouth open. The heavy promotion centered on Monroe&#x27;s nudity on the already-famous calendar, together with the teasers in marketing, made the new &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine a success.
The first issue sold out in weeks. Known circulation was 53,991. The cover price was 50¢. Copies of the first issue in mint to near-mint condition sold for over $5,000 in 2002.

The novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, by Ray Bradbury, was published in 1953 and serialized in the March, April and May 1954 issues of &quot;Playboy&quot;.

An urban legend started about Hefner and the Playmate of the Month because of markings on the front covers of the magazine. From 1955 to 1979 (except for a six-month gap in 1976), the &quot;P&quot; in &quot;Playboy&quot; had stars printed in or around the letter. Urban legend stated that this was either a rating that Hefner gave to the Playmate according to how attractive she was, the number of times that Hefner had slept with her, or how good she was in bed. In truth, stars, between zero and 12, indicated the domestic or international advertising region for that printing.

===1960s–1990s===

In the 1960s, the magazine added &quot;The Playboy Philosophy&quot; column. Early topics included gay rights, women&#x27;s rights, censorship, and the First Amendment. &quot;Playboy&quot; was an early proponent of cannabis reform and provided founding support to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws in 1970.

From 1966 to 1976, Robie Macauley was the fiction editor at &quot;Playboy&quot;. During this period the magazine published fiction by Saul Bellow, Seán Ó Faoláin, John Updike, James Dickey, John Cheever, Doris Lessing, Joyce Carol Oates, Vladimir Nabokov, Michael Crichton, John le Carré, Irwin Shaw, Jean Shepherd, Arthur Koestler, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Bernard Malamud, John Irving, Anne Sexton, Nadine Gordimer, Kurt Vonnegut and J. P. Donleavy, as well as poetry by Yevgeny Yevtushenko.

In 1968, at the feminist Miss America protest, symbolically feminine products were thrown into a &quot;Freedom Trash Can&quot;. These included copies of &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazines. One of the key pamphlets produced by the protesters was &quot;No More Miss America!&quot;, by Robin Morgan, which listed ten characteristics of the Miss America pageant that the authors believed degraded women; it compared the pageant to &quot;Playboy&quot;″s centerfold as sisters under the skin, describing this as &quot;The Unbeatable Madonna–Whore Combination&quot;.

Macauley contributed all of the popular &quot;Ribald Classics&quot; series published between January 1978 and March 1984.

After reaching its peak in the 1970s, &quot;Playboy&quot; saw a decline in circulation and cultural relevance due to competition in the field it founded—first from &quot;Penthouse&quot;, then from &quot;Oui&quot; (which was published as a spin-off of &quot;Playboy&quot;) and &quot;Gallery&quot; in the 1970s; later from pornographic videos; and more recently from lad mags such as &quot;Maxim&quot;, &quot;FHM&quot;, and &quot;Stuff&quot;. In response, &quot;Playboy&quot; attempted to re-assert its hold on the 18–35-year-old male demographic through slight changes to the content and focusing on issues and personalities more appropriate to its audience—such as hip-hop artists being featured in the &quot;&quot;Playboy&quot; Interview&quot;. In February 1974, Ratna Assan became the first women of Indonesian descent to be featured, shortly after a positively received role in the film &quot;Papillon&quot; (1973).

Christie Hefner, daughter of founder Hugh Hefner, joined &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1975 and became head of the company in 1988. She announced in December 2008 that she would be stepping down from leading the company, effective in January 2009. She said that the election of Barack Obama as the next President had inspired her to give more time to charitable work and that the decision to step down was her own. &quot;Just as this country is embracing change in the form of new leadership, I have decided that now is the time to make changes in my own life as well&quot;, she said. Hefner was succeeded by company director and media veteran Jerome H. Kern as interim CEO, who was in turn succeeded by publisher Scott Flanders.

===2000–present===
The magazine celebrated its 50th anniversary with the January 2004 issue. Celebrations were held at Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New York, and Moscow during the year to commemorate this event. &quot;Playboy&quot; also launched limited-edition products designed by fashion houses such as Versace, Vivienne Westwood and Sean John. As a homage to the magazine&#x27;s 50th anniversary, MAC Cosmetics released two limited-edition products: lipstick and glitter cream.

The printed magazine ran several annual features and ratings. One of the most popular was its annual ranking of the top &quot;party schools&quot; among all U.S. universities and colleges. In 2009, the magazine used five criteria—bikini, brains, campus, sex, and sports—to develop its list. The top-ranked party school by &quot;Playboy&quot; for 2009 was the University of Miami.

In June 2009, the magazine reduced its publication schedule to 11 yearly issues, with a combined July/August issue. On August 11, 2009, London&#x27;s &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper reported that Hugh Hefner had sold his English manor house (next door to the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles) for $18 m ($10 m less than the reported asking price) to another American, Daren Metropoulos, the President and co-owner of Pabst Blue Ribbon, and that due to significant losses in the company&#x27;s value (down from $1 billion in 2000 to $84 million in 2009), the Playboy publishing empire was for sale for $300 million. In December 2009, the publication schedule was reduced to 10 issues per year, with a combined January/February issue.

On July 12, 2010, Playboy Enterprises Inc. announced Hefner&#x27;s $5.50 per share offer ($122.5 million based on shares outstanding on April 30 and the closing price on July 9) to buy the portion of the company he did not already own and take the company private with the help of Rizvi Traverse Management LLC. The company derived much of its income from licensing rather than from the magazine. On July 15, &quot;Penthouse&quot; owner FriendFinder Networks Inc. offered $210 million (the company is valued at $185 million). However, Hefner, who already owned 70 percent of voting stock, did not want to sell. In January 2011, the publisher of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine agreed to an offer by Hefner to take the company private for $6.15 per share, an 18 percent premium over the price of the last previous day of trading. The buyout was completed in March 2011.

====20162018 changes and brief ending of full-frontal nudity====
In October 2015, &quot;Playboy&quot; announced the magazine would no longer feature full-frontal nudity beginning with the March 2016 issue. Company CEO Scott Flanders acknowledged the magazine&#x27;s inability to compete with freely available internet pornography and nudity; according to him, &quot;You&#x27;re now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. And so it&#x27;s just passé at this juncture&quot;. Hefner agreed with the decision. The redesigned &quot;Playboy&quot;, however, would still feature a Playmate of the Month and pictures of women. Still, they would be rated as not appropriate for children under 13. The move would not affect PlayboyPlus.com (which features nudity at a paid subscription). Josh Horwitz of &quot;Quartz&quot; argued that the motivation for the decision to remove nudity from the magazine was to give Playboy Licensing a less inappropriate image in India and China, where the brand is a popular item on apparel and thus generates significant revenue.

Other changes to the magazine included ending the popular jokes section and the various cartoons that appeared throughout the magazine. The redesign eliminated the use of jump copy (articles continuing on non-consecutive pages), eliminating most of the space for cartoons. Hefner, himself a former cartoonist, reportedly resisted dropping the cartoons more than the nudity, but ultimately obliged. &quot;Playboy&quot;″s plans were to market itself as a competitor to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, as opposed to more traditional competitors &quot;GQ&quot; and &quot;Maxim&quot;.

&quot;Playboy&quot; announced in February 2017, however, that the dropping of nudity had been a mistake. Furthermore, for its March/April issue, it reestablished some of its franchises, including the Playboy Philosophy and Party Jokes, but dropped the subtitle &quot;Entertainment for Men&quot;, inasmuch as gender roles have evolved. The company&#x27;s chief creative officer made the announcement on Twitter with the hashtag #NakedIsNormal.

In early 2018, and according to Jim Puzzanghera of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot; was reportedly &quot;considering killing the print magazine&quot;, as the publication &quot;has lost as much as $7 million annually in recent years&quot;. However, in the July/August 2018 issue a reader asked if the print magazine would discontinue, and &quot;Playboy&quot; responded that it was not going anywhere.

Following Hefner&#x27;s death and his family&#x27;s financial stake in the company, the magazine changed direction. In 2019, &quot;Playboy&quot; was relaunched as a quarterly publication without adverts. Topics covered included an interview with Tarana Burke, a profile of Pete Buttigieg, coverage of BDSM, and a cover photo representing gender and sexual fluidity.

====Online-only====
In March 2020, Ben Kohn, CEO of Playboy Enterprises, announced that the spring 2020 issue would be the last regularly scheduled printed issue and that the magazine would publish its content online. The decision to close the print edition was attributed in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, which interfered with the distribution of the magazine.

==== Publicly traded ====
In autumn 2020, Playboy announced a reverse merger deal with Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp.—a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). In February 2021, the stock of a combined company, PLBY Group, began trading on the Nasdaq exchange as &quot;PLBY&quot;.

In August 2024 it was announced that the magazine would relaunch in print in February 2025, it will now be published annually.

===Circulation history and statistics===
In 1971, &quot;Playboy&quot; had a circulation rate base of seven million, which was its high point. The best-selling individual issue was the November 1972 edition, which sold 7,161,561 copies. One-quarter of all American college men were buying or subscribing to the magazine every month. On the cover was model Pam Rawlings, photographed by Rowland Scherman. Perhaps coincidentally, a cropped image of the issue&#x27;s centerfold (which featured Lena Söderberg) became a &quot;de facto&quot; standard image for testing image processing algorithms. It is known simply as the &quot;Lenna&quot; (also &quot;Lena&quot;) image in that field. In 1972, &quot;Playboy&quot; was the ninth highest circulation magazine in the United States.

The 1975 average circulation was 5.6 million; by 1981, it was 5.2 million and by 1982 down to 4.9 million. Its decline continued in later decades and reached about 800,000 copies per issue in late 2015, and 400,000 copies by December 2017.

In 1970, &quot;Playboy&quot; became the first gentleman&#x27;s magazine printed in braille. It is also one of the few magazines whose microfilm format was in color, not black and white.

==Features and format==
===Rabbit logo===
&quot;Playboy&quot;″s enduring mascot, a stylized silhouette of a rabbit wearing a tuxedo bow tie, was created by &quot;Playboy&quot; art director Art Paul for the second issue as an endnote, but was adopted as the official logo and has appeared ever since. A running joke in the magazine involves hiding the logo somewhere in the cover art or photograph. Hefner said he chose the rabbit for its &quot;humorous sexual connotation&quot; and because the image was &quot;frisky and playful&quot;. In an interview, Hefner explained his choice of a rabbit as &quot;Playboy&quot;″s logo to the Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci:

The jaunty rabbit quickly became a popular symbol of extroverted male culture, becoming a lucrative source of merchandizing revenue for the company. In the 1950s, it was adopted as the military aircraft insignia for the US Navy&#x27;s Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Four (VX-4).

===The &quot;Playboy&quot; Interview===

Besides its centerfold, a major part of &quot;Playboy&quot; for much of its existence has been the &quot;Playboy&quot; Interview, an extensive (usually several-thousand-word) discussion between a publicly known individual and an interviewer. Writer Alex Haley served as a &quot;Playboy&quot; interviewer on a few occasions; one of his interviews was with Martin Luther King Jr.; he also interviewed Malcolm X and American Nazi Party founder George Lincoln Rockwell. The magazine interviewed then-presidential candidate Jimmy Carter in the November 1976 issue, in which he stated &quot;I&#x27;ve committed adultery in my heart many times.&quot; David Sheff&#x27;s interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono appeared in the January 1981 issue, which was on newsstands at the time of Lennon&#x27;s murder; the interview was later published in book format.

Another interview-type section, entitled &quot;20Q&quot; (a play on the game of Twenty Questions), was added in October 1978. Cheryl Tiegs was the first interviewee for the section.

===Rock the Rabbit===
&quot;Rock the Rabbit&quot; was an annual music news and pictorial feature published in the March edition. The pictorial featured images of rock bands photographed by music photographer Mick Rock. Fashion designers participated in the Rock the Rabbit event by designing T-shirts inspired by &quot;Playboy&quot;″s rabbit head logo for each band. The shirts were sold at &quot;Playboy&quot;″s retailers and auctioned off to raise money for AIDS research and treatment at LIFEbeat: The Music Industry Fights AIDS. Bands who were featured include: MGMT, Daft Punk, Iggy Pop, Duran Duran, Flaming Lips, Snow Patrol, and The Killers.

===Photographers===
The photographers who have contributed to &quot;Playboy&quot; include Mario Casilli, Ana Dias, Richard Fegley, Arny Freytag, Ron Harris, Tom Kelley, Annie Leibovitz, Ken Marcus, David Mecey, Russ Meyer, Helmut Newton, Pompeo Posar, Suze Randall, Herb Ritts, Ellen von Unwerth, Stephen Wayda, Sam Wu, and Bunny Yeager.

==Other editions==

===&quot;Playboy Special Edition&quot;s===
The success of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine has led PEI to market other versions of the magazine, the &quot;Special Edition&quot;s (formerly called &quot;Newsstand Special&quot;s), such as &quot;Playboy&#x27;s College Girls&quot; and &quot;Playboy&#x27;s Book of Lingerie&quot;, as well as the &quot;Playboy&quot; video collection.

===Braille===
The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) has published a braille edition of &quot;Playboy&quot; since 1970. The braille version includes all the written words in the non-braille magazine, but no pictorial representations. Congress cut off funding for the braille magazine translation in 1985, but U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Hogan reversed the decision on First Amendment grounds.

===International editions===

====Current====
====Former====
===Online===
The growth of the Internet prompted the magazine to develop an official internet presence called &quot;Playboy&quot; Online in the late 1980s. The company launched Playboy.com, the official website for Playboy Enterprises and an online companion to &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, in 1994. As part of the online presence, Playboy developed a pay web site called the &quot;Playboy Cyber Club&quot; in 1995 which features online chats, additional pictorials, videos of Playmates and Playboy Cyber Girls that are not featured in the magazine. Archives of past &quot;Playboy&quot; articles and interviews are also included. In September 2005, &quot;Playboy&quot; began publishing a digital version of the magazine.

In 2010, Playboy introduced &quot;The Smoking Jacket&quot;, a safe-for-work website designed to appeal to young men, while avoiding nude images or key words that would cause the site to be filtered or otherwise prohibited in the workplace.

In May 2011, Playboy introduced iplayboy.com, a complete, uncensored version of its near-700-issue archive, targeting the Apple iPad. By launching the archive as a web app, Playboy was able to circumvent both Apple&#x27;s App Store content restrictions and their 30% subscription fee.

==Litigation and legal issues==

Stacy Arthur, Playboy&#x27;s Playmate of the Month for January, 1991, filed a $70 million lawsuit against Playboy Enterprises Inc. and others alleging she was raped and sodomized by three Playboy employees on October 6, 1991, at the Playboy mansion in Los Angeles and that inaction by the magazine led to the death of her husband.

On January 14, 2004, the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that Playboy Enterprises Inc.&#x27;s trademark terms &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Playmate&quot; should be protected in the situation where a user typing &quot;Playboy&quot; or &quot;Playmate&quot; in a browser search was instead shown advertisements of companies that competed with PEI. This decision reversed an earlier district court ruling. The suit started on April 15, 1999, when Playboy sued Excite Inc. and Netscape for trademark infringement.
=== Censorship ===

Many in the American religious community opposed the publication of &quot;Playboy&quot;. The Louisiana pastor and author L. L. Clover wrote in his 1974 treatise, &quot;Evil Spirits, Intellectualism and Logic&quot;, that &quot;Playboy&quot; encouraged young men to view themselves as &quot;pleasure-seeking individuals for whom sex is fun and women are play things.&quot;

In many parts of Asia, including India, mainland China, Myanmar, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and Brunei, sale and distribution of &quot;Playboy&quot; is banned. In addition, sale and distribution is banned in most Muslim countries (except Lebanon and Turkey) including Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan. Despite the ban on the magazine in these countries, the official &quot;Playboy&quot; brand itself can still appear on various merchandise, such as perfume and deodorants.

While banned in mainland China, the magazine is sold in Hong Kong. In Japan, where genitals of models cannot be shown, a separate edition was published under license by Shueisha. An Indonesian edition was launched in April 2006, but controversy started before the first issue hit the stands. Though the publisher said the content of the Indonesian edition will be different from the original edition, the government tried to ban it by using anti-pornography rules. A Muslim organization, the Islamic Defenders Front (IDF), opposed &quot;Playboy&quot; on the grounds of pornography. On April 12, about 150 IDF members clashed with police and stoned the editorial offices. Despite this, the edition quickly sold out. On April 6, 2007, the chief judge of the case dismissed the charges because they had been incorrectly filed.

In 1986, the American convenience store chain 7-Eleven removed the magazine. The store returned &quot;Playboy&quot; to its shelves in late 2003. 7-Eleven had also been selling &quot;Penthouse&quot; and other similar magazines before the ban.

In 1995, &quot;Playboy&quot; was returned to shelves in the Republic of Ireland after a 36-year ban, despite staunch opposition from many women&#x27;s groups.

&quot;Playboy&quot; was not sold in the state of Queensland, Australia, during 2004 and 2005, but returned as of 2006. Due to declining sales, the last Australia-wide edition of &quot;Playboy&quot; was the January 2000 issue.

In 2013, &quot;Playboy&quot; was cleared by the Pentagon of violating its rule against selling sexually explicit material on military property, but the base exchanges stopped selling it anyway.

In March 2018, &quot;Playboy&quot; announced that they would be deactivating their Facebook accounts due to the &quot;sexually repressive&quot; nature of the social media platform and their mismanagement of user data resulting from the Cambridge Analytica problem.

== Female perspectives and experiences ==

=== Gloria Steinem ===

Gloria Steinem, an American activist and journalist went undercover as an employee in 1963 at the New York City Playboy club. The same year she wrote an expose article called &quot;A Bunny&#x27;s Tale&quot;, discussing the inner-workings of a Playboy Bunny, which was later turned into a TV film. Steinem, going by the cover name of Marie Cathrine Ochs, applied for the job of a Playboy bunny. Her goal was to research and investigate the alleged mistreatment and harassment of women at the Playboy club. Steinem prepared a whole background story, very careful not to be discovered. Steinem arrived at the club in New York City, and filled out an application to be a Playboy Bunny. When applying, she was told that as a 24-year-old, she was considered relatively old to work there. Additionally, Steinem detailed how Playboy didn&#x27;t want any backstory, but just wanted their employees to be a pretty face for the company. When applying, Steinem was told the expectations of the workers. Bunnies had to maintain a certain level of personal maintenance, such as always having their makeup, nails and hair done without flaws. The Bunnies were instructed to always be perceived as happy and optimistic. They were also expected to weigh a certain amount, and to have a certain bust size, or else they would get fined. There was a club motto that the Bunnies were hired for 1. Beauty 2. Personality 3. Ability, and the order was very important. Steinem was hired on the spot, and told to come back in a few days for training. She was given the &quot;Bunny Bible&quot;, a rulebook with all the etiquette information. The club had fine lines around prostitution. No Bunny could seem interested or available to customers, however if a top client or a &quot;key-holder&quot; expressed interest, they were encouraged and suggested to comply. Additionally, the club would take 50% of tips earned from the first $30 of the night, 25% of tips up to $60 and 5% of tips after that.

Steinem detailed many forms of harassment she allegedly received during training, including customers touching her costume, putting their arm around her, breathing heavily down her neck, along with multiple instances of being yelled at when refusing to go home with a customer. Steinem claimed to have worked long night shifts in uncomfortable clothing, with no breaks or food. The Bunnies were told they would make around $200 – 300 a week, when in reality they had to share tips and they were underpaid. Steinem also observed and noted in her expose how Bunnies of color were called &quot;Chocolate Bunnies&quot; and were given lower ranking jobs in the club.

=== Jennifer Saginor ===
Jennifer Saginor, author of her memoir &quot;Playground: A Childhood Lost Inside the Playboy Mansion&quot;, experienced the infamous Playboy mansion at the age of six years old for the first time. Her father, Mark Saginor, was Hugh Hefner&#x27;s physician, otherwise known as &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;. Mr. Saginor was the primary reason that Jennifer was introduced to the mansion at such a young age due to his residency there. While her parents were still together, Jennifer and her sister would spend a good amount of time at the mansion with their father, having a plethora of adult experiences sprung on them at a young age. Her mother fought, trying to prevent her daughters from stepping foot into that mansion. She went as far as getting a divorce with &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;, hoping for full custody, as well as court orders.

After Jennifer&#x27;s parents&#x27; divorce, Mr. Saginor spent significantly more time at the mansion than prior, bringing his children along with him. No matter how often her mother would forbid them from going, Jennifer would lie about her whereabouts to spend time at the &quot;playhouse&quot;. Jennifer yearned for her father&#x27;s love and affection, so, she would insist on going to the mansion with him. Unfortunately for Jennifer, this would lead to years of processing her broken childhood, which she is continuing to work on in present times. 

A specific story that Jennifer references in her memoir is, again, at the age of six when she ventures to the mansion for the first time, meeting Hugh Hefner, and is left to her own devices by her father. As she walked through the mansion, surrounded by half-naked strangers, she ran into the butler who showed her to the pool. Once getting to the pool, Jennifer discovered a secret tunnel under the water, leading to an underground Jacuzzi in a separate section of the house. Here, she walked in on John Belushi having sexual intercourse with one of the Playboy Bunnies. She was six years old at the time, but describes her response to this experience as &quot;I am no longer six. I have grown to full maturity in a matter of seconds.&quot; Jennifer&#x27;s experiences display just one of the hidden stories of the Playboy Mansion that haven&#x27;t been addressed or brought to light for the masses. Throughout the rest of her novel, she discusses several stories involving herself and others, sharing what really went down in the mansion during her time residing there, including the sexual relationship she was involved in with one of Hugh Hefner&#x27;s girlfriends.

=== Sondra Theodore ===
Sondra Theodore, Hugh Hefner&#x27;s girlfriend from 1979 to 1981, lived with Hefner in his mansion with her children throughout the duration of her relationship. One of the most famous playboy bunnies, Theodore was featured on the cover of &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1977 and had many centerfold photo shoots throughout her time as a Playboy bunny. In the documentary series &quot;Secrets of Playboy&quot;, she spoke out about her experience and the mistreatment she received during her time in the house. Theodore also spoke about her experience in a joint interview with her daughter for People magazine. In the interview they discuss the vastly different experiences and perspectives they had living in the mansion.

In the documentary, Theodore spoke about the pressure she felt to engage in sexual acts, not only with Hefner, but also with other men and women who frequented the house. She also alleged that she was forced to be a &quot;drug mule&quot; for Hefner, stating that he forced her to retrieve drugs, including cocaine, for his personal use. Many other former bunnies called out Theodore saying that she was &quot;chasing fame&quot; and alleging that her accusations were false due to the fact that she didn&#x27;t speak out for years. The backlash that Theodore faced was in part due to the fact that after their split she remained on good terms with Hefner. She ended up marrying a close friend of Hefner. She also returned to the mansion many times after her split with Hefner and when she eventually divorced her husband it was Hefner who gave her money for a divorce lawyer. Their close friendship, even after their romantic relationship ended, led many to question the validity of Theodore&#x27;s story. In the documentary Theodore acknowledges how she waited to speak out due to blocking out traumatic memories and believing that she didn&#x27;t have a voice. The documentary gave her and other former bunnies a chance to share their experiences. In response to Theodore&#x27;s allegations and the documentary in general, Playboy released an open letter stating that &quot;today&#x27;s Playboy is not Hugh Hefner&#x27;s Playboy&quot;.

<text>The Pennsylvanian ( , also known as Upper Carboniferous or Late Carboniferous) is, on the ICS geologic timescale, the younger of two subperiods of the Carboniferous Period (or the upper of two subsystems of the Carboniferous System). It lasted from roughly . As with most other geochronologic units, the rock beds that define the Pennsylvanian are well identified, but the exact date of the start and end are uncertain by a few hundred thousand years. The Pennsylvanian is named after the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, where the coal beds of this age are widespread.

The division between Pennsylvanian and Mississippian comes from North American stratigraphy. In North America, where the early Carboniferous beds are primarily marine limestones, the Pennsylvanian was in the past treated as a full-fledged geologic period between the Mississippian and the Permian. In parts of Europe, the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian are one more-or-less continuous sequence of lowland continental deposits and are grouped together as the Carboniferous Period. The current internationally used geologic timescale of the ICS gives the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian the rank of subperiods, subdivisions of the Carboniferous Period.

==Life==
===Fungi===
All modern classes of fungi have been found in rocks of Pennsylvanian age.

=== Invertebrates ===
The major forms of life at this time were the arthropods. Arthropods were far larger than modern ones. &quot;Arthropleura&quot;, a giant millipede, was a common sight and the giant griffinfly &quot;Meganeura&quot; &quot;flew the skies&quot;. It is commonly considered that is because of high oxygen level, however some of those large arthropod records are also known from period with relatively low oxygen, which suggest high oxygen pressure may not have been a primary reason for their gigantism.

===Vertebrates===
Amphibians were diverse and common; some were several meters long as adults. The collapse of the rainforest ecology in the mid-Pennsylvanian (between the Moscovian and the Kasimovian) removed many amphibian species that did not survive as well in the cooler, drier conditions. Amniotes, however, prospered due to specific key adaptations. One of the greatest evolutionary innovations of the Carboniferous was the amniote egg, which allowed for the further exploitation of the land by certain tetrapods. These included the earliest sauropsid reptiles (&quot;Hylonomus&quot;), and the earliest known &quot;pelycosaur&quot; synapsids (&quot;Archaeothyris&quot;). Small lizard-like animals quickly gave rise to many descendants. Amniotes underwent a major evolutionary radiation, in response to the drier climate that followed the rainforest collapse.

For some reason, pelycosaurs were able to reach larger sizes before reptiles could, and this trend continued until the end of the Permian, during which their cynodont descendants became smaller and nocturnal, as the reptilian archosaurs took over, although dicynodonts would remain megafaunal until their extinction at the end of the Triassic. Most pre-rainforest collapse tetrapods remained smaller, probably due to the land being primarily occupied by the gigantic millipedes, scorpions, and flying insects. After the rainforest collapse, the giant arthropods disappeared, allowing amniote tetrapods to achieve larger sizes.

==Subdivisions==
The Pennsylvanian has been variously subdivided. The international timescale of the ICS follows the Russian subdivision into four stages:

*Bashkirian (oldest)
*Moscovian
*Kasimovian
*Gzhelian (youngest)

North American subdivision is into five stages, but not precisely the same, with additional (older) Appalachian series names following:

*Morrowan stage, corresponding with the middle and lower part of the Pottsville Group (oldest)
*Atokan stage, corresponding with the upper part of the Pottsville group
*Desmoinesian stage, corresponding with the Allegheny Group
*Missourian stage, corresponding with the Conemaugh Group
*Virgilian stage, corresponding with the Monongahela Group (youngest)

The Virgilian or Conemaugh corresponds to the Gzhelian plus the uppermost Kasimovian.
The Missourian or Monongahela corresponds to the rest of the Kasimovian.
The Desmoinesian or Allegheny corresponds to the upper half of the Moscovian.
The Atokan or upper Pottsville corresponds to the lower half of the Moscovian.
The Morrowan corresponds to the Bashkirian.

In the European subdivision, the Carboniferous is divided into two epochs: Dinantian (early) and Silesian (late). The Silesian starts earlier than the Pennsylvanian and is divided in three ages:
*Namurian (corresponding to Serpukhovian and early Bashkirian)
*Westphalian (corresponding to late Bashkirian, Moskovian and Kasimovian)
*Stephanian (corresponding to Gzhelian).

<text>Paul (Louis-Toussaint) Héroult (10 April 1863 – 9 May 1914) was a French scientist. He was one of the inventors of the Hall-Héroult process for smelting aluminium, and developed the first successful commercial electric arc furnace. He lived in Thury-Harcourt, Normandy.

== Life and career ==
Paul Héroult read Henri Sainte-Claire Deville&#x27;s treatise on aluminium, when he was 15 years old. At that time, aluminium was as expensive as silver and was used mostly for luxury items and jewellery. Héroult wanted to make it cheaper.
He succeeded in doing so when he discovered the electrolytic aluminium process in 1886.
The same year, in the United States, Charles Martin Hall (1863–1914) was discovering the same process. Because of this, the process was called the Hall–Heroult process.

Héroult&#x27;s second most important contribution is the first commercially successful electric arc furnace (EAF) for steel in 1900. The Héroult furnace gradually replaced the giant smelters for the production of a variety of steels. In 1905, Paul Héroult was invited to the United States as a technical adviser to several companies, and in particular to the United States Steel Corporation and the Halcomb Steel Company. Halcomb installed the first Héroult furnace in the US.

The invention of the electric arc furnace probably began when Humphry Davy discovered the carbon arc in 1800. Then in 1878 Carl Wilhelm Siemens patented, constructed and operated both direct and indirect EAFs. Commercial use still needed to wait for larger supplies of electricity and better carbon electrodes.

Paul Héroult is renowned for other major inventions, among them a
self-supporting conduit still used to bring water down from mountain heights and across rivers to hydraulic power plants, avoiding the need to build expensive bridges.

Christian Bickert said of him 
Héroult&#x27;s death on 9 May 1914 followed his reaching the age of 51 by twenty-nine days.

<text>The Permian ( ) is a geologic period and stratigraphic system which spans 47 million years from the end of the Carboniferous Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Triassic Period 251.902 Mya. It is the sixth and last period of the Paleozoic Era; the following Triassic Period belongs to the Mesozoic Era. The concept of the Permian was introduced in 1841 by geologist Sir Roderick Murchison, who named it after the region of Perm in Russia.

The Permian witnessed the diversification of the two groups of amniotes, the synapsids and the sauropsids (reptiles). The world at the time was dominated by the supercontinent Pangaea, which had formed due to the collision of Euramerica and Gondwana during the Carboniferous. Pangaea was surrounded by the superocean Panthalassa. The Carboniferous rainforest collapse left behind vast regions of desert within the continental interior. Amniotes, which could better cope with these drier conditions, rose to dominance in place of their amphibian ancestors.

Various authors recognise at least three, and possibly four extinction events in the Permian. The end of the Early Permian (Cisuralian) saw a major faunal turnover, with most lineages of primitive &quot;pelycosaur&quot; synapsids becoming extinct, being replaced by more advanced therapsids. The end of the Capitanian Stage of the Permian was marked by the major Capitanian mass extinction event, associated with the eruption of the Emeishan Traps. The Permian (along with the Paleozoic) ended with the Permian–Triassic extinction event (colloquially known as the Great Dying), the largest mass extinction in Earth&#x27;s history (which is the last of the three or four crises that occurred in the Permian), in which nearly 81% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial species died out, associated with the eruption of the Siberian Traps. It took well into the Triassic for life to recover from this catastrophe; on land, ecosystems took 30 million years to recover.

==Etymology and history==
Prior to the introduction of the term &quot;Permian&quot;, rocks of equivalent age in Germany had been named the Rotliegend and Zechstein, and in Great Britain as the New Red Sandstone.

The term &quot;Permian&quot; was introduced into geology in 1841 by Sir Roderick Impey Murchison, president of the Geological Society of London, after extensive Russian explorations undertaken with Édouard de Verneuil in the vicinity of the Ural Mountains in the years 1840 and 1841. Murchison identified &quot;vast series of beds of marl, schist, limestone, sandstone and conglomerate&quot; that succeeded Carboniferous strata in the region. Murchison, in collaboration with Russian geologists, named the period after the surrounding Russian region of Perm, which takes its name from the medieval kingdom of Permia that occupied the same area hundreds of years prior, and which is now located in the Perm Krai administrative region. Between 1853 and 1867, Jules Marcou recognised Permian strata in a large area of North America from the Mississippi River to the Colorado River and proposed the name &quot;Dyassic&quot;, from &quot;Dyas&quot; and &quot;Trias&quot;, though Murchison rejected this in 1871. The Permian system was controversial for over a century after its original naming, with the United States Geological Survey until 1941 considering the Permian a subsystem of the Carboniferous equivalent to the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian.

==Geology==
The Permian Period is divided into three epochs, from oldest to youngest, the Cisuralian, Guadalupian, and Lopingian. Geologists divide the rocks of the Permian into a stratigraphic set of smaller units called stages, each formed during corresponding time intervals called ages. Stages can be defined globally or regionally. For &quot;global&quot; stratigraphic correlation, the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) ratify global stages based on a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) from a single formation (a stratotype) identifying the lower boundary of the stage. The ages of the Permian, from youngest to oldest, are:

For most of the 20th century, the Permian was divided into the Early and Late Permian, with the Kungurian being the last stage of the Early Permian. Glenister and colleagues in 1992 proposed a tripartite scheme, advocating that the Roadian-Capitanian was distinct from the rest of the Late Permian, and should be regarded as a separate epoch. The tripartite split was adopted after a formal proposal by Glenister et al. (1999).

Historically, most marine biostratigraphy of the Permian was based on ammonoids; however, ammonoid localities are rare in Permian stratigraphic sections, and species characterise relatively long periods of time. All GSSPs for the Permian are based around the first appearance datum of specific species of conodont, an enigmatic group of jawless chordates with hard tooth-like oral elements. Conodonts are used as index fossils for most of the Palaeozoic and the Triassic.

=== Cisuralian ===
The Cisuralian Series is named after the strata exposed on the western slopes of the Ural Mountains in Russia and Kazakhstan. The name was proposed by J. B. Waterhouse in 1982 to comprise the Asselian, Sakmarian, and Artinskian stages. The Kungurian was later added to conform to the Russian &quot;Lower Permian&quot;. Albert Auguste Cochon de Lapparent in 1900 had proposed the &quot;Uralian Series&quot;, but the subsequent inconsistent usage of this term meant that it was later abandoned.

The Asselian was named by the Russian stratigrapher V.E. Ruzhenchev in 1954, after the Assel River in the southern Ural Mountains. The GSSP for the base of the Asselian is located in the Aidaralash River valley near Aqtöbe, Kazakhstan, which was ratified in 1996. The beginning of the stage is defined by the first appearance of &quot;Streptognathodus postfusus.&quot;

The Sakmarian is named in reference to the Sakmara River in the southern Urals, and was coined by Alexander Karpinsky in 1874. The GSSP for the base of the Sakmarian is located at the Usolka section in the southern Urals, which was ratified in 2018. The GSSP is defined by the first appearance of &quot;Sweetognathus binodosus&quot;.

The Artinskian was named after the city of Arti in Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia. It was named by Karpinsky in 1874. The Artinskian currently lacks a defined GSSP. The proposed definition for the base of the Artinskian is the first appearance of &quot;Sweetognathus aff. S. whitei.&quot;

The Kungurian takes its name after Kungur, a city in Perm Krai. The stage was introduced by Alexandr Antonovich Stukenberg in 1890. The Kungurian currently lacks a defined GSSP. Recent proposals have suggested the appearance of &quot;Neostreptognathodus pnevi&quot; as the lower boundary.

=== Guadalupian ===
The Guadalupian Series is named after the Guadalupe Mountains in Texas and New Mexico, where extensive marine sequences of this age are exposed. It was named by George Herbert Girty in 1902.

The Roadian was named in 1968 in reference to the Road Canyon Member of the Word Formation in Texas. The GSSP for the base of the Roadian is located 42.7m above the base of the Cutoff Formation in Stratotype Canyon, Guadalupe Mountains, Texas, and was ratified in 2001. The beginning of the stage is defined by the first appearance of &quot;Jinogondolella nankingensis&quot;.

The Wordian was named in reference to the Word Formation by Johan August Udden in 1916, Glenister and Furnish in 1961 was the first publication to use it as a chronostratigraphic term as a substage of the Guadalupian Stage. The GSSP for the base of the Wordian is located in Guadalupe Pass, Texas, within the sediments of the Getaway Limestone Member of the Cherry Canyon Formation, which was ratified in 2001. The base of the Wordian is defined by the first appearance of the conodont &quot;Jinogondolella aserrata.&quot;

The Capitanian is named after the Capitan Reef in the Guadalupe Mountains of Texas, named by George Burr Richardson in 1904, and first used in a chronostratigraphic sense by Glenister and Furnish in 1961 as a substage of the Guadalupian Stage. The Capitanian was ratified as an international stage by the ICS in 2001. The GSSP for the base of the Capitanian is located at Nipple Hill in the southeast Guadalupe Mountains of Texas, and was ratified in 2001, the beginning of the stage is defined by the first appearance of &quot;Jinogondolella postserrata.&quot;

=== Lopingian ===
The Lopingian was first introduced by Amadeus William Grabau in 1923 as the &quot;Loping Series&quot; after Leping, Jiangxi, China. Originally used as a lithostraphic unit, T.K. Huang in 1932 raised the Lopingian to a series, including all Permian deposits in South China that overlie the Maokou Limestone. In 1995, a vote by the Subcommission on Permian Stratigraphy of the ICS adopted the Lopingian as an international standard chronostratigraphic unit.&quot;&quot;

The Wuchiapinginan and Changhsingian were first introduced in 1962, by J. Z. Sheng as the &quot;Wuchiaping Formation&quot; and &quot;Changhsing Formation&quot; within the Lopingian series. The GSSP for the base of the Wuchiapingian is located at Penglaitan, Guangxi, China and was ratified in 2004. The boundary is defined by the first appearance of &quot;Clarkina postbitteri postbitteri&quot;&quot;&quot; The Changhsingian was originally derived from the Changxing Limestone, a geological unit first named by the Grabau in 1923, ultimately deriving from Changxing County, Zhejiang .The GSSP for the base of the Changhsingian is located 88 cm above the base of the Changxing Limestone in the Meishan D section, Zhejiang, China and was ratified in 2005, the boundary is defined by the first appearance of &quot;Clarkina wangi.&quot;

The GSSP for the base of the Triassic is located at the base of Bed 27c at the Meishan D section, and was ratified in 2001. The GSSP is defined by the first appearance of the conodont &quot;Hindeodus parvus&quot;.

=== Regional stages ===
The Russian Tatarian Stage includes the Lopingian, Capitanian and part of the Wordian, while the underlying Kazanian includes the rest of the Wordian as well as the Roadian. In North America, the Permian is divided into the Wolfcampian (which includes the Nealian and the Lenoxian stages); the Leonardian (Hessian and Cathedralian stages); the Guadalupian; and the Ochoan, corresponding to the Lopingian.

==Paleogeography==

During the Permian, all the Earth&#x27;s major landmasses were collected into a single supercontinent known as Pangaea, with the microcontinental terranes of Cathaysia to the east. Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (&quot;Panthalassa&quot;, the &quot;universal sea&quot;), and the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, a large ocean that existed between Asia and Gondwana. The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia, causing the Paleo-Tethys Ocean to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the Neotethys Ocean, an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era. A magmatic arc, containing Hainan on its southwesternmost end, began to form as Panthalassa subducted under the southeastern South China. The Central Pangean Mountains, which began forming due to the collision of Laurasia and Gondwana during the Carboniferous, reached their maximum height during the early Permian around 295 million years ago, comparable to the present Himalayas, but became heavily eroded as the Permian progressed. The Kazakhstania block collided with Baltica during the Cisuralian, while the North China Craton, the South China Block and Indochina fused to each other and Pangea by the end of the Permian. The Zechstein Sea, a hypersaline epicontinental sea, existed in what is now northwestern Europe.

Large continental landmass interiors experience climates with extreme variations of heat and cold (&quot;continental climate&quot;) and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns. Deserts seem to have been widespread on Pangaea. Such dry conditions favored gymnosperms, plants with seeds enclosed in a protective cover, over plants such as ferns that disperse spores in a wetter environment. The first modern trees (conifers, ginkgos and cycads) appeared in the Permian.

Three general areas are especially noted for their extensive Permian deposits—the Ural Mountains (where Perm itself is located), China, and the southwest of North America, including the Texas red beds. The Permian Basin in the U.S. states of Texas and New Mexico is so named because it has one of the thickest deposits of Permian rocks in the world.

=== Paleoceanography ===
Sea levels dropped slightly during the earliest Permian (Asselian). The sea level was stable at several tens of metres above present during the Early Permian, but there was a sharp drop beginning during the Roadian, culminating in the lowest sea level of the entire Palaeozoic at around present sea level during the Wuchiapingian, followed by a slight rise during the Changhsingian.

==Climate==

The Permian was cool in comparison to most other geologic time periods, with modest pole to Equator temperature gradients. At the start of the Permian, the Earth was still in the Late Paleozoic icehouse (LPIA), which began in the latest Devonian and spanned the entire Carboniferous period, with its most intense phase occurring during the latter part of the Pennsylvanian epoch. A significant trend of increasing aridification can be observed over the course of the Cisuralian. Early Permian aridification was most notable in Pangaean localities at near-equatorial latitudes. Sea levels also rose notably in the Early Permian as the LPIA slowly waned. At the Carboniferous-Permian boundary, a warming event occurred. In addition to becoming warmer, the climate became notably more arid at the end of the Carboniferous and beginning of the Permian. Nonetheless, temperatures continued to cool during most of the Asselian and Sakmarian, during which the LPIA peaked. By 287 million years ago, temperatures warmed and the South Pole ice cap retreated in what was known as the Artinskian Warming Event (AWE), though glaciers remained present in the uplands of eastern Australia, and perhaps also the mountainous regions of far northern Siberia. Southern Africa also retained glaciers during the late Cisuralian in upland environments. The AWE also witnessed aridification of a particularly great magnitude. 

In the late Kungurian, cooling resumed, resulting in a cool glacial interval that lasted into the early Capitanian, though average temperatures were still much higher than during the beginning of the Cisuralian. Another cool period began around the middle Capitanian. This cool period, lasting for 3–4 Myr, was known as the Kamura Event. It was interrupted by the Emeishan Thermal Excursion in the late part of the Capitanian, around 260 million years ago, corresponding to the eruption of the Emeishan Traps. This interval of rapid climate change was responsible for the Capitanian mass extinction event. 

During the early Wuchiapingian, following the emplacement of the Emeishan Traps, global temperatures declined as carbon dioxide was weathered out of the atmosphere by the large igneous province&#x27;s emplaced basalts. The late Wuchiapingian saw the finale of the Late Palaeozoic Ice Age, when the last Australian glaciers melted. The end of the Permian is marked by a temperature excursion, much larger than the Emeishan Thermal Excursion, at the Permian-Triassic boundary, corresponding to the eruption of the Siberian Traps, which released more than 5 teratonnes of CO2, more than doubling the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. A -2% &quot;δ&quot;18O excursion signifies the extreme magnitude of this climatic shift. This extremely rapid interval of greenhouse gas release caused the Permian-Triassic mass extinction, as well as ushering in an extreme hothouse that persisted for several million years into the next geologic epoch, the Triassic.

The Permian climate was also extremely seasonal and characterised by megamonsoons, which produced high aridity and extreme seasonality in Pangaea&#x27;s interiors. Precipitation along the western margins of the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean was very high. Evidence for the megamonsoon includes the presence of megamonsoonal rainforests in the Qiangtang Basin of Tibet, enormous seasonal variation in sedimentation, bioturbation, and ichnofossil deposition recorded in sedimentary facies in the Sydney Basin, and palaeoclimatic models of the Earth&#x27;s climate based on the behaviour of modern weather patterns showing that such a megamonsoon would occur given the continental arrangement of the Permian. The aforementioned increasing equatorial aridity was likely driven by the development and intensification of this Pangaean megamonsoon.

==Life==
===Marine biota===
Permian marine deposits are rich in fossil mollusks, brachiopods, and echinoderms. Brachiopods were highly diverse during the Permian. The extinct order Productida was the predominant group of Permian brachiopods, accounting for up to about half of all Permian brachiopod genera. Brachiopods also served as important ecosystem engineers in Permian reef complexes. Amongst ammonoids, Goniatitida were a major group during the Early-Mid Permian, but declined during the Late Permian. Members of the order Prolecanitida were less diverse. The Ceratitida originated from the family Daraelitidae within Prolecanitida during the mid-Permian, and extensively diversified during the Late Permian. Only three families of trilobite are known from the Permian, Proetidae, Brachymetopidae and Phillipsiidae. Diversity, origination and extinction rates during the Early Permian were low. Trilobites underwent a diversification during the Kungurian-Wordian, the last in their evolutionary history, before declining during the Late Permian. By the Changhsingian, only a handful (4–6) genera remained. Corals exhibited a decline in diversity over the course of the Middle and Late Permian.

===Terrestrial biota===
Terrestrial life in the Permian included diverse plants, fungi, arthropods, and various types of tetrapods. The period saw a massive desert covering the interior of Pangaea. The warm zone spread in the northern hemisphere, where extensive dry desert appeared. The rocks formed at that time were stained red by iron oxides, the result of intense heating by the sun of a surface devoid of vegetation cover. A number of older types of plants and animals died out or became marginal elements.

The Permian began with the Carboniferous flora still flourishing. About the middle of the Permian a major transition in vegetation began. The swamp-loving lycopod trees of the Carboniferous, such as &quot;Lepidodendron&quot; and &quot;Sigillaria&quot;, were progressively replaced in the continental interior by the more advanced seed ferns and early conifers as a result of the Carboniferous rainforest collapse. At the close of the Permian, lycopod and equisete swamps reminiscent of Carboniferous flora survived only in Cathaysia, a series of equatorial islands in the Paleo-Tethys Ocean that later would become South China.

The Permian saw the radiation of many important conifer groups, including the ancestors of many present-day families. Rich forests were present in many areas, with a diverse mix of plant groups. The southern continent saw extensive seed fern forests of the &quot;Glossopteris&quot; flora. Oxygen levels were probably high there. The ginkgos and cycads also appeared during this period.

====Insects====

Insects, which had first appeared and become abundant during the preceding Carboniferous, experienced a dramatic increase in diversification during the Early Permian. Towards the end of the Permian, there was a substantial drop in both origination and extinction rates. The dominant insects during the Permian Period were early representatives of Paleoptera, Polyneoptera, and Paraneoptera. Palaeodictyopteroidea, which had represented the dominant group of insects during the Carboniferous, declined during the Permian. This is likely due to competition by Hemiptera, due to their similar mouthparts and therefore ecology. Primitive relatives of damselflies and dragonflies (Meganisoptera), which include the largest flying insects of all time, also declined during the Permian. Holometabola, the largest group of modern insects, also diversified during this time. &quot;Grylloblattidans&quot;, an extinct group of winged insects thought to be related to modern ice crawlers, reached their apex of diversity during the Permian, representing up to a third of all insects at some localities. Mecoptera (sometimes known as scorpionflies) first appeared during the Early Permian, going on to become diverse during the Late Permian. Some Permian mecopterans, like Mesopsychidae have long proboscis that suggest they may have pollinated gymnosperms. The earliest known beetles appeared at the beginning of the Permian. Early beetles such as members of Permocupedidae were likely xylophagous, feeding on decaying wood. Several lineages such as Schizophoridae expanded into aquatic habitats by the Late Permian. Members of the modern orders Archostemata and Adephaga are known from the Late Permian. Complex wood boring traces found in the Late Permian of China suggest that members of Polyphaga, the most diverse group of modern beetles, were also present by the Late Permian. 

====Tetrapods====

The terrestrial fossil record of the Permian is patchy and temporally discontinuous. Early Permian records are dominated by equatorial Europe and North America, while those of the Middle and Late Permian are dominated by temperate Karoo Supergroup sediments of South Africa and the Ural region of European Russia. Early Permian terrestrial faunas of North America and Europe were dominated by primitive pelycosaur synapsids including the herbivorous edaphosaurids, and carnivorous sphenacodontids, diadectids and amphibians. Early Permian reptiles, such as acleistorhinids, were mostly small insectivores.

====Amniotes====
Synapsids (the group that would later include mammals) thrived and diversified greatly during the Cisuralian. Permian synapsids included some large members such as &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;. The special adaptations of synapsids enabled them to flourish in the drier climate of the Permian and they grew to dominate the vertebrates. A faunal turnover occurred around the transition between the Cisuralian and Guadalupian, with the decline of amphibians and the replacement of pelycosaurs (a paraphyletic group) with more advanced therapsids, although the decline of early synapsid clades was apparently a slow event that lasted about 20 Ma, from the Sakmarian to the end of the Kungurian. Predator-prey interactions among terrestrial synapsids became more dynamic. If terrestrial deposition ended around the end of the Cisuralian in North America and began in Russia during the early Guadalupian, a continuous record of the transition is not preserved. Uncertain dating has led to suggestions that there is a global hiatus in the terrestrial fossil record during the late Kungurian and early Roadian, referred to as &quot;Olson&#x27;s Gap&quot; that obscures the nature of the transition. Other proposals have suggested that the North American and Russian records overlap, with the latest terrestrial North American deposition occurring during the Roadian, suggesting that there was an extinction event, dubbed &quot;Olson&#x27;s Extinction&quot;. The Middle Permian faunas of South Africa and Russia are dominated by therapsids, most abundantly by the diverse Dinocephalia. Dinocephalians become extinct at the end of the Middle Permian, during the Capitanian mass extinction event. Late Permian faunas are dominated by advanced therapsids such as the predatory sabertoothed gorgonopsians and herbivorous beaked dicynodonts, alongside large herbivorous pareiasaur parareptiles. The Archosauromorpha, the group of reptiles that would give rise to the pseudosuchians, dinosaurs, and pterosaurs in the following Triassic, first appeared and diversified during the Late Permian, including the first appearance of the Archosauriformes during the latest Permian. Cynodonts, the group of therapsids ancestral to modern mammals, first appeared and gained a worldwide distribution during the Late Permian. Another group of therapsids, the therocephalians (such as &quot;Lycosuchus&quot;), arose in the Middle Permian. There were no flying vertebrates, though the extinct lizard-like reptile family Weigeltisauridae from the Late Permian had extendable wings like modern gliding lizards, and are the oldest known gliding vertebrates.

====Amphibians====
Permian stem-amniotes consisted of lepospondyli and batrachosaurs, according to some phylogenies; according to others, stem-amniotes are represented only by diadectomorphs. 

Temnospondyls reached a peak of diversity in the Cisuralian, with a substantial decline during the Guadalupian-Lopingian following Olson&#x27;s extinction, with the family diversity dropping below Carboniferous levels.

Embolomeres, a group of aquatic crocodile-like limbed vertebrates that are reptilliomorphs under some phylogenies. They previously had their last records in the Cisuralian, are now known to have persisted into the Lopingian in China.

Modern amphibians (lissamphibians) are suggested to have originated during Permian, descending from a lineage of dissorophoid temnospondyls or lepospondyls.

=== Fish ===
The diversity of fish during the Permian is relatively low compared to the following Triassic. The dominant group of bony fishes during the Permian were the &quot;Paleopterygii&quot; a paraphyletic grouping of Actinopterygii that lie outside of Neopterygii. The earliest unequivocal members of Neopterygii appear during the Early Triassic, but a Permian origin is suspected. The diversity of coelacanths is relatively low throughout the Permian in comparison to other marine fishes, though there is an increase in diversity during the terminal Permian (Changhsingian), corresponding with the highest diversity in their evolutionary history during the Early Triassic. Diversity of freshwater fish faunas was generally low and dominated by lungfish and &quot;Paleopterygians&quot;. The last common ancestor of all living lungfish is thought to have existed during the Early Permian. Though the fossil record is fragmentary, lungfish appear to have undergone an evolutionary diversification and size increase in freshwater habitats during the Early Permian, but subsequently declined during the middle and late Permian. Conodonts experienced their lowest diversity of their entire evolutionary history during the Permian. Permian chondrichthyan faunas are poorly known. Members of the chondrichthyan clade Holocephali, which contains living chimaeras, reached their apex of diversity during the Carboniferous-Permian, the most famous Permian representative being the &quot;buzz-saw shark&quot; &quot;Helicoprion,&quot; known for its unusual spiral shaped spiral tooth whorl in the lower jaw. Hybodonts, a group of shark-like chondrichthyans, were widespread and abundant members of marine and freshwater faunas throughout the Permian. Xenacanthiformes, another extinct group of shark-like chondrichthyans, were common in freshwater habitats, and represented the apex predators of freshwater ecosystems.

=== Flora ===

Four floristic provinces in the Permian are recognised, the Angaran, Euramerican, Gondwanan, and Cathaysian realms. The Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse would result in the replacement of lycopsid-dominated forests with tree-fern dominated ones during the late Carboniferous in Euramerica, and result in the differentiation of the Cathaysian floras from those of Euramerica. The Gondwanan floristic region was dominated by Glossopteridales, a group of woody gymnosperm plants, for most of the Permian, extending to high southern latitudes. The ecology of the most prominent glossopterid, &quot;Glossopteris&quot;, has been compared to that of bald cypress, living in mires with waterlogged soils. The tree-like calamites, distant relatives of modern horsetails, lived in coal swamps and grew in bamboo-like vertical thickets. A mostly complete specimen of &quot;Arthropitys&quot; from the Early Permian Chemnitz petrified forest of Germany demonstrates that they had complex branching patterns similar to modern angiosperm trees. By the Late Permian, high thin forests had become widespread across the globe, as evidenced by the global distribution of weigeltisaurids.
The oldest likely record of Ginkgoales (the group containing &quot;Ginkgo&quot; and its close relatives) is &quot;Trichopitys heteromorpha&quot; from the earliest Permian of France. The oldest known fossils definitively assignable to modern cycads are known from the Late Permian. In Cathaysia, where a wet tropical frost-free climate prevailed, the Noeggerathiales, an extinct group of tree fern-like progymnosperms were a common component of the flora The earliest Permian (~ 298 million years ago) Cathyasian Wuda Tuff flora, representing a coal swamp community, has an upper canopy consisting of lycopsid tree &quot;Sigillaria,&quot; with a lower canopy consisting of Marattialean tree ferns, and Noeggerathiales. Early conifers appeared in the Late Carboniferous, represented by primitive walchian conifers, but were replaced with more derived voltzialeans during the Permian. Permian conifers were very similar morphologically to their modern counterparts, and were adapted to stressed dry or seasonally dry climatic conditions. The increasing aridity, especially at low latitudes, facilitated the spread of conifers and their increasing prevalence throughout terrestrial ecosystems. Bennettitales, which would go on to become in widespread the Mesozoic, first appeared during the Cisuralian in China. Lyginopterids, which had declined in the late Pennsylvanian and subsequently have a patchy fossil record, survived into the Late Permian in Cathaysia and equatorial east Gondwana.

== Permian–Triassic extinction event ==
The Permian ended with the most extensive extinction event recorded in paleontology: the Permian–Triassic extinction event. 90 to 95% of marine species became extinct, as well as 70% of all land organisms. It is also the only known mass extinction of insects. Recovery from the Permian–Triassic extinction event was protracted; on land, ecosystems took 30 million years to recover. Trilobites, which had thrived since Cambrian times, finally became extinct before the end of the Permian. Nautiloids, a subclass of cephalopods, surprisingly survived this occurrence.

There is evidence that magma, in the form of flood basalt, poured onto the Earth&#x27;s surface in what is now called the Siberian Traps, for thousands of years, contributing to the environmental stress that led to mass extinction. The reduced coastal habitat and highly increased aridity probably also contributed. Based on the amount of lava estimated to have been produced during this period, the worst-case scenario is the release of enough carbon dioxide from the eruptions to raise world temperatures five degrees Celsius.

Another hypothesis involves ocean venting of hydrogen sulfide gas. Portions of the deep ocean will periodically lose all of its dissolved oxygen allowing bacteria that live without oxygen to flourish and produce hydrogen sulfide gas. If enough hydrogen sulfide accumulates in an anoxic zone, the gas can rise into the atmosphere. Oxidizing gases in the atmosphere would destroy the toxic gas, but the hydrogen sulfide would soon consume all of the atmospheric gas available. Hydrogen sulfide levels might have increased dramatically over a few hundred years. Models of such an event indicate that the gas would destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere allowing ultraviolet radiation to kill off species that had survived the toxic gas. There are species that can metabolize hydrogen sulfide.

Another hypothesis builds on the flood basalt eruption theory. An increase in temperature of five degrees Celsius would not be enough to explain the death of 95% of life. But such warming could slowly raise ocean temperatures until frozen methane reservoirs below the ocean floor near coastlines melted, expelling enough methane (among the most potent greenhouse gases) into the atmosphere to raise world temperatures an additional five degrees Celsius. The frozen methane hypothesis helps explain the increase in carbon-12 levels found midway in the Permian–Triassic boundary layer. It also helps explain why the first phase of the layer&#x27;s extinctions was land-based, the second was marine-based (and starting right after the increase in C-12 levels), and the third land-based again.

<text>Pisces is a constellation of the zodiac. Its vast bulk – and main asterism viewed in most European cultures per Greco-Roman antiquity as a distant pair of fishes connected by one cord each that join at an apex – are in the Northern celestial hemisphere. Its old astronomical symbol is (♓︎). Its name is Latin for &quot;fishes&quot;. It is between Aquarius, of similar size, to the southwest and Aries, which is smaller, to the east. The ecliptic and the celestial equator intersect within this constellation and in Virgo. The Sun passes directly overhead of the equator, on average, at approximately this point in the sky, at the March equinox.

The right ascension/declination 00 is located within the boundaries of Pisces.

== Features ==
The March equinox is currently located in Pisces, due south of Psc, and, due to precession, slowly drifting due west, just below the western fish towards Aquarius.

===Stars ===

Although Pisces is a large constellation, there are only two stars brighter than magnitude 4 in Pisces. It is also the second dimmest of the zodiac constellations.
* Alrescha (&quot;the cord&quot;), otherwise Alpha Piscium (α Psc), 309.8 lightyears, class A2, magnitude 3.62, variable binary star
* Fumalsamakah (&quot;mouth of the fish&quot;), otherwise Beta Piscium (β Psc), 492 lightyears, class B6Ve, magnitude 4.48
* Delta Piscium (δ Psc), 305 lightyears, class K5III, magnitude 4.44. Like other stars near the ecliptic, Delta Piscium is subject to lunar occultations.
* Epsilon Piscium (ε Psc), 190 lightyears, class K0III, magnitude 4.27. Has a candidate exoplanet.
* Revati (&quot;rich&quot;), otherwise Zeta Piscium (ζ Psc), 148 lightyears, class A7IV, magnitude 5.21. Quintuple star system.
* Alpherg (&quot;emptying&quot;), otherwise Eta Piscium (η Psc), 349 lightyears, class G7 IIIa, magnitude 3.62. It is a Gamma Cassiopeiae variable with a weak magnetic field.
* Torcular (&quot;thread&quot;), otherwise Omicron Piscium (ο Psc), 258 lightyears, class K0III, magnitude 4.2. It is an evolved red giant star on the horizontal branch.
* Omega Piscium (ω Psc), 106 lightyears, class F4IV, magnitude 4.03. It is an F-type star that is either a subgiant or on the main sequence.
* Gamma Piscium (γ Psc), 138 lightyears, magnitude 3.70. The star hosts an exoplanet which was discovered in 2021. It has a spectral type of G8 III.
* Van Maanen&#x27;s Star is the closest-known solitary white dwarf to us, with a dim apparent magnitude. It is located about 2° to the south of the star Delta Piscium, with a relatively high proper motion of 2.978″ annually along a position angle of 155.538°. It is closer to the Sun than any other solitary white dwarf. It is too faint to be seen with the naked eye. Like other white dwarfs, it is a very dense star: its mass has been estimated to be about 67% of the Sun&#x27;s, yet it has only 1% of the Sun&#x27;s radius. The outer atmosphere has a temperature of approximately 6,110 K, which is relatively cool for a white dwarf. As all white dwarfs steadily radiate away their heat over time, this temperature can be used to estimate its age, thought to be around 3 billion years. It was originally thought to be an F-type star before the properties of white dwarfs were known.

Due to the dimness of these stars, the constellation is essentially invisible in or near any major city due to light pollution.

=== Deep-sky objects ===

M74 is a loosely wound (type Sc) spiral galaxy in Pisces, found at a distance of 30 million light years (redshift 0.0022). It has many clusters of young stars and the associated nebulae, showing extensive regions of star formation. It was discovered by Pierre Méchain, a French astronomer, in 1780. A type II-P supernova was discovered in the outer regions of M74 by Robert Evans in June 2003; the star that underwent the supernova was later identified as a red supergiant with a mass of 8 solar masses. It is the brightest member of the M74 Group.

NGC 488 is an isolated face-on prototypical spiral galaxy. Two supernovae have been observed in the galaxy.

NGC 520 is a pair of colliding galaxies located 105 million light-years away.

CL 0024+1654 is a massive galaxy cluster that lenses the galaxy behind it, creating arc-shaped images of the background galaxy. The cluster is primarily made up of yellow elliptical and spiral galaxies, at a distance of 3.6 billion light-years from Earth (redshift 0.4), half as far away as the background galaxy, which is at a distance of 5.7 billion light-years (redshift 1.67).

== History and mythology ==

Pisces originates from some composition of the Babylonian constellations &quot;Šinunutu4&quot; &quot;the great swallow&quot; in current western Pisces, and &quot;Anunitum&quot; the &quot;Lady of the Heaven&quot;, at the place of the northern fish. In the first-millennium BC texts known as the &quot;Astronomical Diaries&quot;, part of the constellation was also called DU.NU.NU (&quot;Rikis-nu.mi&quot;, &quot;the fish cord or ribbon&quot;).

=== Greco-Roman period ===
Pisces is associated with the Greek legend that Aphrodite and her son Eros either shape-shifted into forms of fishes to escape, or were rescued by two fishes.

In the Greek version according to Hyginus, Aphrodite and Eros while visiting Syria fled from the monster Typhon by leaping into the Euphrates River and transforming into fishes (&quot;Poeticon astronomicon&quot; 2.30, citing Diognetus Erythraeus). The Roman variant of the story has Venus and Cupid (counterparts for Aphrodite and Eros) carried away from this danger on the backs of two fishes (Ovid &quot;Fasti&quot; 2.457ff).

There is also a different origin tale that Hyginus preserved in another work. According to this, an egg rolled into the Euphrates, and some fishes nudged this to shore, after which the doves sat on the egg until Aphrodite (thereafter called the Syrian Goddess) hatched out of it. The fishes were then rewarded by being placed in the skies as a constellation (&quot;Fabulae&quot; 197). This story is also recorded by the Third Vatican Mythographer.

=== Modern period ===

In 1690, the astronomer Johannes Hevelius in his &quot;Firmamentum Sobiescianum&quot; regarded the constellation Pisces as being composed of four subdivisions:
* Piscis Boreus (the North Fish): σ – 68 – 65 – 67 – ψ1 – ψ2 – ψ3 – χ – φ – υ – 91 – τ – 82 – 78 Psc.
* Linum Boreum (the North Cord): χ – ρ,94 – VX(97) – η – π – ο – α Psc.
* Linum Austrinum (the South Cord): α – ξ – ν – μ – ζ – ε – δ – 41 – 35 – ω Psc.
* Piscis Austrinus (the South Fish): ω – ι – θ – 7 – β – 5 – κ,9 – λ – TX(19) Psc.

&quot;Piscis Austrinus&quot; more often refers to a separate constellation in its own right. 

In 1754, the botanist and author John Hill proposed to sever a southern zone of Pisces as Testudo (the Turtle). 24 – 27 – YY(30) – 33 – 29 Psc., It would host a natural but quite faint asterism in which the star 20 Psc is the head of the turtle. While Admiral Smyth mentioned the proposal, it was largely neglected by other astronomers, and it is now obsolete.

===Western folklore===
The Fishes are in the German lore of Antenteh, who owned just a tub and a crude cabin when he met two magical fish. They offered him a wish, which he refused. However, his wife begged him to return to the fish and ask for a beautifully furnished home. This wish was granted, but her desires were not satisfied. She then asked to be a queen and have a palace, but when she asked to become a goddess, the fish became angry and took the palace and home, leaving the couple with the tub and cabin once again. The tub is sometimes recognized as the Great Square of Pegasus.

=== In non-Western astronomy ===
The stars of Pisces were incorporated into several constellations in Chinese astronomy. Wai-ping (&quot;Outer Enclosure&quot;) was a fence that kept a pig farmer from falling into the marshes and kept the pigs where they belonged. It was represented by Alpha, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Mu, Nu, and Xi Piscium. The marshes were represented by the four stars designated Phi Ceti. The northern fish of Pisces was a part of the House of the Sandal, Koui-siou.

<doc id="23229" wikidata="Q273233" url="?curid=23229" title="Paul Robeson">
<text>Paul Leroy Robeson ( ; April 9, 1898 – January 23, 1976) was an American bass-baritone concert artist, actor, professional football player, and activist who became famous both for his cultural accomplishments and for his political stances.

In 1915, Robeson won an academic scholarship to Rutgers College in New Brunswick, New Jersey, where he was the only African-American student. While at Rutgers, he was twice named a consensus All-American in football and was elected class valedictorian. He earned his LL.B. from Columbia Law School, while playing in the National Football League (NFL). After graduation, he became a figure in the Harlem Renaissance, with performances in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot; and &quot;All God&#x27;s Chillun Got Wings&quot;.

Robeson performed in Britain in a touring melodrama, &quot;Voodoo&quot;, in 1922, and in &quot;Emperor Jones&quot; in 1925. In 1928, he scored a major success in the London premiere of &quot;Show Boat&quot;. Living in London for several years with his wife Eslanda, Robeson continued to establish himself as a concert artist and starred in a London production of &quot;Othello&quot;, the first of three productions of the play over the course of his career. He also gained attention in &quot;Sanders of the River&quot; (1935) and in the film production of &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1936). Robeson&#x27;s political activities began with his involvement with unemployed workers and anti-imperialist students in Britain, and it continued with his support for the Republican cause during the Spanish Civil War and his involvement in the Council on African Affairs.

After returning to the United States in 1939, Robeson supported the American and Allied war efforts during World War II. His history of supporting civil rights causes and Soviet policies, however, brought scrutiny from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). After the war ended, the Council on African Affairs was placed on the Attorney General&#x27;s List of Subversive Organizations. Robeson was investigated during the McCarthy era. When he refused to recant his public advocacy of his political beliefs, the U.S. State Department withdrew his passport and his income plummeted. He moved to Harlem and published a periodical called &quot;Freedom&quot;, which was critical of United States policies, from 1950 to 1955. Robeson&#x27;s right to travel was eventually restored as a result of the 1958 United States Supreme Court decision &quot;Kent v. Dulles&quot;.

Between 1925 and 1961, Robeson released recordings of some 276 songs. The first of these was the spiritual &quot;Steal Away&quot;, backed with &quot;Were You There&quot;, in 1925. Robeson&#x27;s recorded repertoire spanned many styles, including Americana, popular standards, classical music, European folk songs, political songs, poetry and spoken excerpts from plays.

==Early life==

===1898–1915: Childhood===

Robeson was born in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1898, to Reverend William Drew Robeson and Maria Louisa Bustill. His mother, Maria, was a member of the Bustills, a prominent Quaker family of mixed ancestry. His father, William, was of Igbo origin and was born into slavery. William escaped from a plantation in his teens and eventually became the minister of Princeton&#x27;s Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church in 1881. Robeson had three brothers: William Drew Jr. (born 1881), Reeve (born ), and Ben (born ); and one sister, Marian (born ).

In 1900, a disagreement between William and white financial supporters of the Witherspoon church arose with apparent racial undertones, which were prevalent in Princeton. William, who had the support of his entirely black congregation, resigned in 1901. The loss of his position forced him to work menial jobs. Three years later when Robeson was six, his mother, who was nearly blind, died in a house fire. Eventually, William became financially incapable of providing a house for himself and his children still living at home, Ben and Paul, so they moved into the attic of a store in Westfield, New Jersey.

William found a stable parsonage at the St. Thomas A.M.E. Zion in 1910, where Robeson filled in for his father during sermons when he was called away. In 1912, Robeson began attending Somerville High School in New Jersey, where he performed in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and &quot;Othello&quot;, sang in the chorus, and excelled in football, basketball, baseball and track. His athletic dominance elicited racial taunts which he ignored. Prior to his graduation, he won a statewide academic contest for a scholarship to Rutgers and was named class valedictorian. He took a summer job as a waiter in Narragansett Pier, Rhode Island, where he befriended Fritz Pollard, later to be the first African-American coach in the National Football League.

===1915–1919: Rutgers College===

In late 1915, Robeson became the third African-American student ever enrolled at Rutgers, and the only one at the time. He tried out for the Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team, and his resolve to make the squad was tested as his teammates engaged in excessive play, during which his nose was broken and his shoulder dislocated. The coach, Foster Sanford, decided he had overcome the provocation and announced that he had made the team.

Robeson joined the debating team and he sang off-campus for spending money, and on-campus with the Glee Club informally, as membership required attending all-white mixers. He also joined the other collegiate athletic teams. As a sophomore, amidst Rutgers&#x27; sesquicentennial celebration, he was benched when a Southern football team, Washington and Lee University, refused to take the field because the Scarlet Knights had fielded a Negro, Robeson.

After a standout junior year of football, he was recognized in &quot;The Crisis&quot; for his athletic, academic, and singing talents. At this time his father fell grievously ill. Robeson took the sole responsibility in caring for him, shuttling between Rutgers and Somerville. His father, who was the &quot;glory of his boyhood years&quot; soon died, and at Rutgers, Robeson expounded on the incongruity of African Americans fighting to protect America in World War I but not having the same opportunities in the United States as whites.
He finished university with four annual oratorical triumphs and varsity letters in multiple sports. His football playing as end won him first-team All-American selection, in both his junior and senior years. Walter Camp considered him the greatest end ever. Academically, he was accepted into Phi Beta Kappa and Cap and Skull. His classmates recognized him by electing him class valedictorian. &quot;The Daily Targum&quot; published a poem featuring his achievements. In his valedictory speech, he exhorted his classmates to work for equality for all Americans. At Rutgers, Robeson also gained a reputation for his singing, having a deep rich voice which some saw as bass with a high range, others as baritone with low notes. Throughout his career, Robeson was classified as a bass-baritone.

===1919–1923: Columbia Law School and marriage===
Robeson entered New York University School of Law in fall 1919. To support himself, he became an assistant football coach at Lincoln University, where he joined the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. However, Robeson felt uncomfortable at NYU and moved to Harlem and transferred to Columbia Law School in February 1920. Already known in the black community for his singing, he was selected to perform at the dedication of the Harlem YWCA.

Robeson began dating Eslanda &quot;Essie&quot; Goode and after her coaxing, he made his theatrical debut as Simon in Ridgely Torrence&#x27;s &quot;Simon of Cyrene&quot;. After a year of courtship, they were married in August 1921.

Robeson was recruited by Fritz Pollard to play for the NFL&#x27;s Akron Pros while he continued his law studies. In the spring of 1922, Robeson postponed school to portray Jim in Mary Hoyt Wiborg&#x27;s play &quot;Taboo&quot;. He then sang in the chorus of an Off-Broadway production of &quot;Shuffle Along&quot; before he joined &quot;Taboo&quot; in Britain. The play was adapted by Mrs Patrick Campbell to highlight his singing. After the play&#x27;s run ended, he befriended Lawrence Benjamin Brown, a classically trained musician, before returning to Columbia while playing for the NFL&#x27;s Milwaukee Badgers. He ended his football career after the 1922 season, and graduated from Columbia Law School in 1923.

==Theatrical success and ideological transformation==

===1923–1927: Harlem Renaissance===
Robeson briefly worked as a lawyer, but he renounced a career in law because of racism. His wife supported them financially. She was the head histological chemist in Surgical Pathology at New York-Presbyterian Hospital. She continued to work there until 1925 when his career took off. They frequented the social functions at the future Schomburg Center. In December 1924 he landed the lead role of Jim in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;All God&#x27;s Chillun Got Wings&quot;, which culminated with Jim metaphorically consummating his marriage with his white wife by symbolically emasculating himself. &quot;Chillun&#x27;s&quot; opening was postponed due to nationwide controversy over its plot.

&quot;Chillun&#x27;s&quot; delay led to a revival of &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot; with Robeson as Brutus, a role pioneered by Charles Sidney Gilpin. The role terrified and galvanized Robeson, as it was practically a 90-minute soliloquy. Reviews declared him an unequivocal success. Though arguably clouded by its controversial subject, his Jim in &quot;Chillun&quot; was less well received. He answered criticism of its plot by writing that fate had drawn him to the &quot;untrodden path&quot; of drama, that the true measure of a culture is in its artistic contributions, and that the only true American culture was African-American.

The success of his acting placed him in elite social circles and his rise to fame, which was forcefully aided by Essie, had happened very rapidly. Essie&#x27;s ambition for Robeson was a startling dichotomy to his indifference. She quit her job, became his agent, and negotiated his first movie role in a silent race film directed by Oscar Micheaux, &quot;Body and Soul&quot; (1925). To support a charity for single mothers, Robeson headlined a concert singing spirituals. He performed his repertoire of spirituals on the radio.

Lawrence Benjamin Brown, who had become renowned while touring as a pianist with gospel singer Roland Hayes, chanced upon Robeson in Harlem. The two ad-libbed a set of spirituals, with Robeson as lead and Brown as accompanist. This so enthralled them that they booked Provincetown Playhouse for a concert. The pair&#x27;s rendition of African-American folk songs and spirituals was captivating, and Victor Records signed Robeson to a contract in September 1925.

The Robesons went to London for a revival of &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot;, before spending the rest of the fall on holiday on the French Riviera, socializing with Gertrude Stein and Claude McKay. Robeson and Brown performed a series of concert tours in America from January 1926 until May 1927.

During a hiatus in New York, Robeson learned that Essie was several months pregnant. Paul Robeson Jr. was born in November 1927 in New York, while Robeson and Brown toured Europe. Essie experienced complications from the birth, and by mid-December, her health had deteriorated dramatically. Ignoring Essie&#x27;s objections, her mother wired Robeson and he immediately returned to her bedside. Essie completely recovered after a few months.

===1928–1932: &quot;Show Boat&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot;, and marriage difficulties===
In 1928, Robeson played &quot;Joe&quot; in the London production of the American musical &quot;Show Boat&quot;, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. His rendition of &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; became the benchmark for all future performers of the song. Some black critics objected to the play due to its usage of the then-common racial epithet &quot;nigger&quot;. It was, nonetheless, immensely popular with white audiences. He was summoned for a Royal Command Performance at Buckingham Palace and Robeson was befriended by Members of Parliament from the House of Commons. &quot;Show Boat&quot; continued for 350 performances and, as of 2001, it remained the Royal&#x27;s most profitable venture. The Robesons bought a home in Hampstead. He reflected on his life in his diary and wrote that it was all part of a &quot;higher plan&quot; and &quot;God watches over me and guides me. He&#x27;s with me and lets me fight my own battles and hopes I&#x27;ll win.&quot; However, an incident at the Savoy Grill, in which he was refused seating, caused him to issue a press release describing the insult which subsequently became a matter of public debate.

Essie had learned early in their marriage that Robeson had extramarital affairs, but she tolerated them. However, when she discovered that he was having another affair, she unfavorably altered the characterization of him in his biography, and defamed him by describing him with &quot;negative racial stereotypes&quot;. Despite her uncovering of this tryst, there was no public evidence that their relationship had soured.

The couple appeared in the experimental Swiss film &quot;Borderline&quot; (1930). He then returned to the Savoy Theatre, in London&#x27;s West End to play &quot;Othello&quot;, opposite Peggy Ashcroft as Desdemona. He cited the lack of a &quot;racial problem&quot; in London as significant in his decision to move to London. Robeson was the first black actor to play Othello in Britain since Ira Aldridge. The production received mixed reviews which noted Robeson&#x27;s &quot;highly civilized quality [but lacking the] grand style&quot;. Robeson stated the best way to diminish the oppression African Americans faced was for his artistic work to be an example of what &quot;men of my colour&quot; could accomplish rather than to &quot;be a propagandist and make speeches and write articles about what they call the Colour Question.&quot;

After Essie discovered Robeson had been having an affair with Ashcroft, she decided to seek a divorce and they split up. While working in London, Robeson became one of the first artists to record at the new EMI Recording Studios (later known as Abbey Road Studios), recording four songs in September 1931, almost two months before the studio was officially opened. Robeson returned to Broadway as Joe in the 1932 revival of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, to critical and popular acclaim. He received, with immense pride, an honorary master&#x27;s degree from Rutgers. It is said that Foster Sanford, his college football coach advised him that divorcing Essie and marrying Ashcroft would do irreparable damage to his reputation. In any case, Ashcroft and Robeson&#x27;s relationship ended in 1932, and Robeson and Essie reconciled, leaving their relationship scarred permanently.

===1933–1937: Ideological awakening===
In 1933, Robeson played the role of Jim in the London production of &quot;Chillun&quot;, virtually gratis, then returned to the United States to star as Brutus in the film &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot;the first film to feature an African American in a starring role, &quot;a feat not repeated for more than two decades in the U.S.&quot; His acting in &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot; was well received. On the film set he rejected any slight to his dignity, despite the widespread Jim Crow atmosphere in the United States. Upon returning to England, he publicly criticized African Americans&#x27; rejection of their own culture. Despite negative reactions from the press, such as a &quot;New York Amsterdam News&quot; retort that Robeson had made a &quot;jolly well [ass of himself]&quot;, he also announced that he would reject any offers to perform central European (though not Russian, which he considered &quot;Asiatic&quot;) opera because the music had no connection to his heritage.

In early 1934, Robeson enrolled in the School of Oriental and African Studies, a constituent college of the University of London, where he studied phonetics and Swahili. His &quot;sudden interest&quot; in African history and its influence on culture coincided with his essay &quot;I Want to be African&quot;, wherein he wrote of his desire to embrace his ancestry.
His friends in the anti-imperialist movement and his association with British socialists led him to visit the Soviet Union. Robeson, Essie, and Marie Seton traveled to the Soviet Union on an invitation from Sergei Eisenstein in December 1934. A stopover in Berlin enlightened Robeson to the racism in Nazi Germany and, on his arrival in Moscow, in the Soviet Union, Robeson said, &quot;Here I am not a Negro but a human being for the first time in my life ... I walk in full human dignity.&quot;

He undertook the role of Bosambo in the movie &quot;Sanders of the River&quot; (1935), which he felt would render a realistic view of colonial African culture. &quot;Sanders of the River&quot; made Robeson an international movie star; but the stereotypical portrayal of a colonial African was seen as embarrassing to his stature as an artist and damaging to his reputation. The Commissioner of Nigeria to London protested the film as slanderous to his country, and Robeson thereafter became more politically conscious in his choice of roles. He appeared in the play &quot;Stevedore&quot; at the Embassy Theatre in London in May 1935, which was favorably reviewed in &quot;The Crisis&quot; by Nancy Cunard, who concluded: &quot;&quot;Stevedore&quot; is extremely valuable in the racialsocial questionit is straight from the shoulder&quot;. In early 1936, he decided to send his son to school in the Soviet Union to shield him from racist attitudes. He then played the role of Toussaint Louverture in the eponymous play by C. L. R. James at the Westminster Theatre, and appeared in the films &quot;Song of Freedom&quot;, and &quot;Show Boat&quot; in 1936, and &quot;My Song Goes Forth&quot;, &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;. and &quot;Big Fella&quot;, all in 1937. In 1938, he was named by American &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot; as the 10th most popular star in British cinema.
In 1935, Robeson met Albert Einstein when Einstein came backstage after Robeson&#x27;s concert at the McCarter Theatre. The two discovered that, as well as a mutual passion for music, they shared a hatred for fascism. The friendship between Robeson and Einstein lasted nearly twenty years, but was not well known or publicized.

===1937–1939: Spanish Civil War and political activism===
Robeson believed that the struggle against fascism during the Spanish Civil War was a turning point in his life and transformed him into a political activist. In 1937, he used his concert performances to advocate the Republican cause and the war&#x27;s refugees. He permanently modified his renditions of &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; – initially, by singing the word &quot;darkies&quot; instead of &quot;niggers&quot;; later, by changing some of the stereotypical dialect in the lyrics to standard English and replacing the fatalistic last verse (&quot;Ah gits weary / An&#x27; sick of tryin&#x27; / Ah&#x27;m tired of livin&#x27; / An skeered of dyin) with an uplifting verse of his own (&quot;But I keep laffin&#x27; / Instead of cryin&#x27; / I must keep fightin&#x27; / Until I&#x27;m dyin) – transforming it from a tragic &quot;song of resignation with a hint of protest implied&quot; into a battle hymn of unwavering defiance. His business agent expressed concern about his political involvement, but Robeson overruled him and decided that contemporary events trumped commercialism. In Wales, he commemorated the Welsh people killed while fighting for the Republicans, where he recorded a message that became his epitaph: &quot;The artist must take sides. He must elect to fight for freedom or slavery. I have made my choice. I had no alternative.&quot;

After an invitation from J. B. S. Haldane, he traveled to Spain in 1938 because he believed in the International Brigades&#x27;s cause, visited the hospital of Benicàssim, singing to the wounded soldiers. Robeson also visited the battlefront and provided a morale boost to the Republicans at a time when their victory was unlikely. Back in England, he hosted Jawaharlal Nehru to support Indian independence, whereat Nehru expounded on imperialism&#x27;s affiliation with Fascism. Robeson reevaluated the direction of his career and decided to focus on the ordeals of &quot;common people&quot;. He appeared in the pro-labor play &quot;Plant in the Sun&quot;, in which he played an Irishman, his first &quot;white&quot; role. With Max Yergan, and the International Committee on African Affairs (later known as the Council on African Affairs), Robeson became an advocate for African nationalism and political independence.

Paul Robeson was living in Britain until the start of the Second World War in 1939. His name was included in the &quot;Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.&quot; as a target for arrest if Germany had occupied Britain.

==World War II, the Broadway &quot;Othello&quot;, political activism, and McCarthyism==

=== 1939–1945: World War II, and the Broadway &quot;Othello&quot; ===

Robeson&#x27;s last British film was &quot;The Proud Valley&quot; (1940), set in a Welsh coal-mining town. The film was still being shot when Hitler&#x27;s invasion of Poland led to England&#x27;s declaration of war at the beginning of September 1939; several weeks later, just after the completion of filming, Robeson and his family returned to the United States, arriving in New York in October 1939. They lived at first in the Sugar Hill neighborhood of Harlem, and in 1941 settled in Enfield, Connecticut.

After his well-received performance of &quot;Ballad for Americans&quot; on a live CBS radio broadcast on November 5, with a repeat performance on New Year&#x27;s Day 1940, the song became a popular seller. In 1940, the magazine &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; named Robeson America&#x27;s &quot;no. 1 entertainer&quot;. Nevertheless, during a tour in 1940, the Beverly Wilshire Hotel was the only major Los Angeles hotel willing to accommodate him due to his race, at an exorbitant rate and registered under an assumed name, and he therefore dedicated two hours every afternoon to sitting in the lobby, where he was widely recognised, &quot;to ensure that the next time Black come through, they&#x27;ll have a place to stay.&quot; Los Angeles hotels lifted their restrictions on black guests soon afterwards.

Robeson narrated the 1942 documentary &quot;Native Land&quot; which was labeled by the FBI as communist propaganda. After an appearance in &quot;Tales of Manhattan&quot; (1942), a production which he felt was &quot;very offensive to my people&quot; due to the way the segment was handled in stereotypes, he announced that he would no longer act in films because of the demeaning roles available to blacks.

According to democratic socialist writer Barry Finger&#x27;s critical appraisal of Robeson, while the Hitler-Stalin pact was still in effect, Robeson counseled American blacks that they had no stake in the rivalry of European powers. Once Russia was attacked, he urged blacks to support the war effort, now warning that an Allied defeat would &quot;make slaves of us all&quot;. Robeson participated in benefit concerts on behalf of the war effort and at a concert at the Polo Grounds, he met two emissaries from the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, Solomon Mikhoels and Itzik Feffer. Subsequently, Robeson reprised the role of Othello at the Shubert Theatre in 1943, and became the first African American to play the role with a white supporting cast on Broadway. The production was a success, running for 296 performances on Broadway (a record for a Shakespeare production on Broadway that still stands), and winning for Robeson the first Donaldson Award for Best Actor in a Play. During the same period, he addressed a meeting with Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis and team owners in a failed attempt to convince them to admit black players to Major League Baseball. He toured North America with &quot;Othello&quot; until 1945, and subsequently, his political efforts with the Council on African Affairs to get colonial powers to discontinue their exploitation of Africa were short-circuited by the United Nations.

During this period, Robeson also developed a sympathy for the Republic of China&#x27;s side in the Second Sino-Japanese War. In 1940, the Chinese progressive activist, Liu Liangmo taught Robeson the patriotic song &quot;Chee Lai!&quot; (&quot;Arise!&quot;), known as the March of the Volunteers. Robeson premiered the song at a concert in New York City&#x27;s Lewisohn Stadium and recorded it in both English and Chinese for Keynote Records in early 1941. Robeson gave further performances at benefit concerts for the China Aid Council and United China Relief at Washington&#x27;s Uline Arena on April 24, 1941. The Washington Committee for Aid to China&#x27;s booking of Constitution Hall had been blocked by the Daughters of the American Revolution owing to Robeson&#x27;s race. The indignation was so great that Eleanor Roosevelt and Hu Shih, the Chinese ambassador, became sponsors. However, when the organizers offered tickets on generous terms to the National Negro Congress to help fill the larger venue, both sponsors withdrew, objecting to the NNC&#x27;s Communist ties.

Robeson opposed the U.S. support for Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang in China, and denounced U.S. support for Chiang at political events over the course of 1945–1946, including the World Peace Conference and the National Peace Commission. In Robeson&#x27;s view, the Kuomintang&#x27;s anti-communist focus and blockade of the Communist guerrilla army meant that China was fighting Japan &quot;with one hand tied behind its back&quot;.

March of the Volunteers (&quot;Chee lai!&quot;) became newly founded People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s National Anthem after 1949. Its Chinese lyricist, Tian Han, died in a Beijing prison in 1968, but Robeson continued to send royalties to his family.

===1946–1949: Attorney General&#x27;s List of Subversive Organizations===
After the Moore&#x27;s Ford lynchings of four African Americans in Georgia on July 25, 1946, Robeson met with President Truman and admonished Truman by stating that if he did not enact legislation to end lynching, &quot;the Negroes will defend themselves&quot;. Truman immediately terminated the meeting and declared that the time was not right to propose anti-lynching legislation. Subsequently, Robeson publicly called upon all Americans to demand that Congress pass civil rights legislation. Robeson founded the American Crusade Against Lynching organization in 1946. This organization was thought to be a threat to the NAACP antiviolence movement. Robeson received support from W. E. B. Du Bois on this matter and launched the organization on the anniversary of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation, September 23.

About this time, Robeson&#x27;s belief that trade unionism was crucial to civil rights became a mainstay of his political beliefs as he became a proponent of the union activist and Communist Party USA member Revels Cayton. Robeson was later called before the Tenney Committee where he responded to questions about his affiliation with the Communist Party USA by testifying that he was not a member of the party. Nevertheless, two organizations with which Robeson was intimately involved, the Civil Rights Congress and the Council on African Affairs, were placed on the Attorney General&#x27;s List of Subversive Organizations. Subsequently, he was summoned before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and when questioned about his affiliation with the Communist Party, he refused to answer, stating: &quot;Some of the most brilliant and distinguished Americans are about to go to jail for the failure to answer that question, and I am going to join them, if necessary.&quot;

In 1948, Robeson was prominent in Henry A. Wallace&#x27;s bid for the President of the United States, during which Robeson traveled to the Deep South, at risk to his own life, to campaign for him. In the ensuing year, Robeson was forced to go overseas to work because his concert performances were canceled at the FBI&#x27;s behest. While on tour, he spoke at the World Peace Council. The Associated Press published a false transcript of his speech which gave the impression that Robeson had equated America with a Fascist state. In an interview, Robeson said the &quot;danger of Fascism [in the US] has averted&quot;. Nevertheless, the speech publicly attributed to him was a catalyst for his being seen as an enemy of mainstream America. Robeson refused to bow to public criticism when he advocated in favor of twelve defendants, including his long-time friend, Benjamin J. Davis Jr., charged during the Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders.
Robeson traveled to Moscow in June 1949, and tried to find Itzik Feffer whom he had met during World War II. He let Soviet authorities know that he wanted to see him. Reluctant to lose Robeson as a propagandist for the Soviet Union, the Soviets brought Feffer from prison to him. Feffer told him that Mikhoels had been murdered, and predicted that he would be executed. To protect the Soviet Union&#x27;s reputation, and to keep the right wing of the United States from gaining the moral high ground, Robeson denied that any persecution existed in the Soviet Union, and kept the meeting secret for the rest of his life, except from his son. On June 20, 1949, Robeson spoke at the Paris Peace Congress saying that &quot;We in America do not forget that it was on the backs of the white workers from Europe and on the backs of millions of Blacks that the wealth of America was built. And we are resolved to share it equally. We reject any hysterical raving that urges us to make war on anyone. Our will to fight for peace is strong. We shall not make war on anyone. We shall not make war on the Soviet Union. We oppose those who wish to build up imperialist Germany and to establish fascism in Greece. We wish peace with Franco&#x27;s Spain despite her fascism. We shall support peace and friendship among all nations, with Soviet Russia and the people&#x27;s Republics.&quot; He was blacklisted for saying this in the mainstream press within the United States, including in many periodicals of the Negro press such as &quot;The Crisis&quot;.

In order to isolate Robeson politically, the House Un-American Activities Committee subpoenaed Jackie Robinson to comment on Robeson&#x27;s Paris speech. Robinson testified that Robeson&#x27;s statements, &quot;&#x27;if accurately reported&#x27;, were silly&#x27;&quot;. Former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt noted, &quot;Mr. Robeson does his people great harm in trying to line them up on the Communist side of [the] political picture. Jackie Robinson helps them greatly by his forthright statements.&quot; Days later, the announcement of a concert headlined by Robeson in New York City provoked the local press to decry the use of their community to support &quot;subversives&quot;. The Peekskill riots ensued in which violent anti-Robeson protests shut down a Robeson concert on August 27, 1949, and marred the aftermath of the replacement concert held eight days later.

===1950–1955: Blacklisted===
In its review of Christy Walsh&#x27;s massive 1949 reference, &quot;College Football and All America Review&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised it as &quot;the most complete source of past gridiron scores, players, coaches, etc., yet published&quot;, but it failed to list Robeson as ever having played on the Rutgers team or ever having been an All-American. Months later, NBC canceled Robeson&#x27;s appearance on Eleanor Roosevelt&#x27;s television program, which furthered his erasure from public view.

Robeson opposed U.S. involvement in the Korean War and condemned America&#x27;s nuclear threats against China. In Robeson&#x27;s opinion, the U.S. had manipulated the United Nations for imperialist purposes, and China&#x27;s intervention in the Korean War was necessary to defend the security of millions of people in Asia. Robeson credited &quot;American peace sentiment&quot; as a crucial factor in President Truman not using nuclear weapons and in recalling General Douglas MacArthur.

A month after Robeson began criticizing his country&#x27;s role in the Korean War, the Department of State demanded that he return his passport. Robeson refused. At the FBI&#x27;s request, the State Department voided Robeson&#x27;s passport and instructed customs officials to prevent any attempt by him to leave the country. Confining him inside the U.S. afforded him less freedom to express what some saw as his &quot;extreme advocacy on behalf of the independence of the colonial peoples of Africa&quot;. It&#x27;s estimated that the revocation of Robeson&#x27;s travel privileges, and the resulting inability to earn fees overseas, caused his yearly income to drop from $150,000 to less than $3,000. When Robeson met with State Department officials and asked why he was denied a passport, he was told that &quot;his frequent criticism of the treatment of blacks in the United States should not be aired in foreign countries&quot;.

In 1950, Robeson co-founded, with W. E. B. Du Bois, a monthly newspaper, &quot;Freedom&quot;, showcasing his views and those of his circle. Most issues had a column by Robeson, on the front page. In the final issue, July–August 1955, an unsigned column on the front page of the newspaper described the struggle for the restoration of his passport. It called for support from the leading African-American organizations, and asserted that &quot;Negroes, [and] all Americans who have breathed a sigh of relief at the easing of international tensions... have a stake in the Paul Robeson passport case&quot;. An article by Robeson appeared on the second page continuing the passport issue under the headline: &quot;If Enough People Write Washington I&#x27;ll Get My Passport in a Hurry.&quot;

In 1951, an article titled &quot;Paul Robeson – the Lost Shepherd&quot; was published in &quot;The Crisis&quot; and attributed to Robert Alan, although Paul Jr. suspected it was written by &quot;Amsterdam News&quot; columnist Earl Brown. J. Edgar Hoover and the U.S. State Department arranged for the article to be printed and distributed in Africa in order to damage Robeson&#x27;s reputation and reduce his popularity, and Communism&#x27;s popularity, in colonial countries. Another article by Roy Wilkins (now thought to have been the real author of &quot;Paul Robeson – the Lost Shepherd&quot;) denounced Robeson as well as the CPUSA in terms consistent with the FBI&#x27;s anti-Communist propaganda of the era.

In December 1951, Robeson, in New York City, and William L. Patterson, in Paris, presented the United Nations with a Civil Rights Congress petition titled We Charge Genocide. The document asserted that the United States federal government, by its failure to act against lynching in the United States, was guilty of genocide under Article II of the UN Genocide Convention. The petition was not officially acknowledged by the UN, and, though receiving some favorable reception in Europe and in America&#x27;s Black press, was largely either ignored or criticized for its association with Communism in America&#x27;s mainstream press.

In 1952, Robeson was awarded the International Stalin Prize by the Soviet Union. Unable to travel to Moscow, he accepted the award in New York. In April 1953, shortly after Stalin&#x27;s death, Robeson penned &quot;To You My Beloved Comrade&quot;, praising Stalin as dedicated to peace and a guide to the world: &quot;Through his deep humanity, by his wise understanding, he leaves us a rich and monumental heritage.&quot; Robeson&#x27;s opinions about the Soviet Union kept his passport out of reach and stopped his return to the entertainment industry and the civil rights movement. In his opinion, the Soviet Union was the guarantor of political balance in the world.

In a symbolic act of defiance against the travel ban, in May 1952, labor unions in the United States and Canada organized a concert at the International Peace Arch on the border between Washington state and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Robeson returned to perform a second concert at the Peace Arch in 1953, and over the next two years, two further concerts took place. In this period, with the encouragement of his friend the Welsh politician Aneurin Bevan, Robeson recorded a number of radio concerts for supporters in Wales.

===1956–1957: End of McCarthyism===

On June 12, 1956, Robeson was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee after he refused to sign an affidavit affirming he was not a Communist. He attempted to read his prepared statement into the Congressional Record, but the Committee denied him that opportunity. During questioning, he invoked the Fifth Amendment and declined to reveal his political affiliations. When asked why he had not remained in the Soviet Union, given his affinity with its political ideology, he replied, &quot;because my father was a slave and my people died to build [the United States and], I am going to stay here, and have a part of it just like you and no fascist-minded people will drive me from it!&quot; At that hearing, Robeson stated &quot;Whether I am or not a Communist is irrelevant. The question is whether American citizens, regardless of their political beliefs or sympathies, may enjoy their constitutional rights.&quot;

Due to the reaction to the promulgation of Robeson&#x27;s political views, his recordings and films were removed from public distribution, and he was universally condemned in the U.S. press. During the height of the Cold War, it became increasingly difficult in the United States to hear Robeson sing on commercial radio, buy his music or see his films.

In 1956, in the United Kingdom, Topic Records, at that time part of the Workers Music Association, released a single of Robeson singing the labor anthem &quot;Joe Hill&quot;, written by Alfred Hayes and Earl Robinson, backed with &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;. In 1956, after public pressure brought a one-time exemption to the travel ban, Robeson performed two concerts in Canada in February, one in Toronto and the other at a union convention in Sudbury, Ontario.

Still unable to perform abroad in person, on May 26, 1957, Robeson sang for a London audience at St. Pancras Town Hall (where the 1,000 available concert tickets for &quot;Let Robeson Sing&quot; sold out within an hour) via the recently completed transatlantic telephone cable TAT-1. In October of that year, using the same technology, Robeson sang to an audience of &quot;perhaps 5,000&quot; at Porthcawl&#x27;s Grand Pavilion in Wales.

Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s denunciation of Stalinism at the 1956 Party Congress silenced Robeson on Stalin, although Robeson continued to praise the Soviet Union. That year Robeson, along with close friend W.E.B. Du Bois, compared the anti-Soviet uprising in Hungary to the &quot;same sort of people who overthrew the Spanish Republican Government&quot; and supported the Soviet invasion and suppression of the revolt.

Robeson&#x27;s passport was finally restored in 1958 as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s 5 to 4 decision in &quot;Kent v. Dulles&quot; where the majority ruled that the denial of a passport without due process amounted to a violation of constitutionally protected liberty under the 5th Amendment.

==Later years==
===&quot;Here I Stand&quot;===
While still confined in the U.S., Robeson finished his defiant &quot;manifesto-autobiography&quot; &quot;Here I Stand&quot;, published on February 14, 1958. John Vernon noted in &quot;Negro History Bulletin&quot; that &quot;few publications dared or cared to review it—as if he had no longer existed&quot;. In a preface to the 1971 edition, Robeson&#x27;s friend and collaborator Lloyd L. Brown wrote that &quot;no white commercial newspaper or magazine in the entire country so much as mentioned Robeson&#x27;s book. Leading papers in the field of literary coverage, like &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Herald-Tribune&quot;, not only did not review it; they refused even to include its name in their lists of &#x27;books out today&#x27;.&quot; Brown added that the boycott was not in effect in foreign countries, for example, &quot;Here I Stand&quot; was favorably reviewed in England, Japan, and India. The book also received prompt attention from the African-American press. The &quot;Baltimore Afro-American&quot; was the first to champion the merits of Robeson&#x27;s autobiography. The &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot;, &quot;Chicago Crusader&quot;, and the Los Angeles &quot;Herald-Dispatch&quot; soon followed suit. The NAACP&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The Crisis&quot;, was more critical in its appraisal.

===1958–1960: Comeback tours===
====Europe====
After Robeson&#x27;s passport was returned in June 1958, he immediately left the U.S. for Europe. He embarked on a world tour using London as his base. He gave 28 performances in towns and cities around Great Britain. In April 1959, he starred in Tony Richardson&#x27;s production of &quot;Othello&quot; at Stratford-upon-Avon. In Moscow in August 1959, he received a tumultuous reception at the Luzhniki Stadium where he sang classic Russian songs along with American standards. Robeson and Essie then flew to Yalta to rest and spend time with Nikita Khrushchev.

On October 11, 1959, Robeson took part in a service at London&#x27;s St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, the first black performer to sing there.

On a trip to Moscow, Robeson experienced bouts of dizziness and heart problems and was hospitalized for two months while Essie was diagnosed with operable cancer. He recovered and returned to Great Britain to visit the National Eisteddfod of Wales.

In 1960, in what was his final concert performance in Great Britain, Robeson sang to raise money for the Movement for Colonial Freedom at the Royal Festival Hall.

====Australia and New Zealand====
In October 1960, Robeson embarked on a two-month concert tour of Australia and New Zealand with Essie, primarily to generate money, at the behest of Australian politician Bill Morrow. While in Sydney, he became the first major artist to perform at the construction site of the future Sydney Opera House. After appearing at the Brisbane Festival Hall, they went to Auckland where Robeson reaffirmed his support of Marxism-Leninism, denounced the inequality faced by the Māori and efforts to denigrate their culture. Thereabouts, Robeson publicly stated &quot;... the people of the lands of Socialism want peace dearly&quot;.

During the tour he was introduced to Faith Bandler and other activists who aroused the Robesons&#x27; concern for the plight of the Aboriginal Australians. Robeson subsequently demanded that the Australian government provide them with full citizenship and equal rights. He attacked the view that they were unsophisticated and uncultured, and declared that &quot;there&#x27;s no such thing as a &quot;backward&quot; human being, there is only a society which says they are backward.&quot;

Robeson left Australia as a respected, albeit controversial, figure and his support for Aboriginal rights had a profound effect in Australia over the next decade.

===1961–1963: Health breakdown===

Back in London after his Australia and New Zealand tour, Robeson expressed a desire to return to the United States and participate in the civil rights movement, while his wife argued that he would be unsafe there and &quot;unable to make any money&quot; due to government harassment. In March 1961 Robeson again traveled to Moscow.

====Moscow breakdown====
During an uncharacteristically wild party in his Moscow hotel room, Robeson locked himself in his bedroom and attempted suicide by cutting his wrists. Three days later, under Soviet medical care, he told his son, who had received news about his condition and traveled to Moscow, that he felt extreme paranoia, he thought that the walls of the room were moving and, overcome by a powerful sense of emptiness and depression, he tried to take his own life.

Paul Jr. has stated that his father&#x27;s health problems stemmed from the CIA&#x27;s and MI5&#x27;s attempts to &quot;neutralize&quot; his father. He remembered that his father had had such fears before his prostate operation. He said that three doctors treating Robeson in London and New York had been CIA contractors, and that his father&#x27;s symptoms resulted from being &quot;subjected to mind de-patterning under MK-ULTRA&quot;, a secret CIA programme. Martin Duberman wrote that Robeson&#x27;s health breakdown was probably brought on by a combination of factors including extreme emotional and physical stress, bipolar depression, exhaustion and the beginning of circulatory and heart problems. &quot;[E]ven without an organic predisposition and accumulated pressures of government harassment he might have been susceptible to a breakdown.&quot;

====Repeated deterioration in London====
Robeson stayed at the Barvikha Sanatorium until September 1961, when he left for London. There his depression reemerged, and after another period of recuperation in Moscow, he returned to London.

Three days after arriving back , he became suicidal and suffered a panic attack while passing the Soviet Embassy. He was admitted to the Priory Hospital, where he underwent electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and was given heavy doses of drugs for nearly two years, with no accompanying psychotherapy. During his treatment at the Priory, Robeson was being monitored by the British MI5.

Both British and American intelligence services were well aware of Robeson&#x27;s suicidal state of mind: An FBI memo described Robeson&#x27;s debilitated condition, remarking that his &quot;death would be much publicized&quot; and would be used for Communist propaganda, necessitating continued surveillance. Numerous memos advised that Robeson should be denied a passport renewal, an obstacle that was likely to further jeopardize his recovery process.

====Treatment in East Germany====
In August 1963, disturbed about his treatment, friends and family had Robeson transferred to the Buch Clinic in East Berlin. Given psychotherapy and less medication, his physicians found him still &quot;completely without initiative&quot; and they expressed &quot;doubt and anger&quot; about the &quot;high level of barbiturates and ECT&quot; that had been administered in London. He rapidly improved, though his doctor stressed that &quot;what little is left of Paul&#x27;s health must be quietly conserved.&quot;

===1963–1976: Retirement===

In December 1963, Robeson returned to the United States and for the remainder of his life lived mainly in seclusion. He momentarily assumed a role in the civil rights movement, making a few major public appearances before falling seriously ill during a tour. Double pneumonia and a kidney blockage in 1965 nearly killed him.

====Invitations to become involved in the civil rights movement====
Robeson was contacted by Bayard Rustin and James Farmer and both of them asked him about the possibility of becoming involved in the mainstream of the Civil Rights Movement.

Because of Rustin&#x27;s past anti-Communist stances, Robeson declined to meet with him. Robeson eventually met with Farmer, but because he was asked to denounce Communism and the Soviet Union in order to assume a place in the mainstream, Robeson adamantly declined.

====Final years====
After Essie, who had been his spokesperson to the media, died in December 1965, Robeson moved in with his son&#x27;s family in New York City. He was rarely seen strolling near his Harlem apartment on Jumel Place, and his son responded to press inquiries that his &quot;father&#x27;s health does not permit him to perform, or answer questions.&quot; In 1968, he settled at his sister&#x27;s home in Philadelphia.

Numerous celebrations were held in honor of Robeson over the next several years, including at public arenas that had previously shunned him, but he saw few visitors aside from close friends and gave few statements apart from messages to support current civil rights and international movements, feeling that his record &quot;spoke for itself&quot;.

At a Carnegie Hall tribute to mark his 75th birthday in 1973, he was unable to attend, but a taped message from him was played that said: &quot;Though I have not been able to be active for several years, I want you to know that I am the same Paul, dedicated as ever to the worldwide cause of humanity for freedom, peace and brotherhood.&quot;

===1976: Death, funeral, and public response===
On January 23, 1976, following complications of a stroke, Robeson died in Philadelphia at the age of 77. He lay in state in Harlem and his funeral was held at his brother Ben&#x27;s former parish, Mother Zion AME Zion Church, where Bishop J. Clinton Hoggard performed the eulogy. His 12 pall bearers included Harry Belafonte and Fritz Pollard. He was interred in the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.

Biographer Martin Duberman said of news media notices upon Robeson&#x27;s death:the &quot;white [American] press ... ignored the continuing inability of white America to tolerate a black maverick who refused to bend, ... downplayed the racist component central to his persecution&quot; [during his life, as they] &quot;gingerly&quot; [paid him] &quot;respect and tipped their hat to him as a &#x27;great American&#x27;,&quot; while the black American press, &quot;which had never, overall, been as hostile to Robeson&quot; [as the white American press had,] opined that his life &quot; &#x27;... would always be a challenge to white and Black America.&#x27; &quot;

==Legacy and honors==

Early in his life, Robeson was one of the most influential participants in the Harlem Renaissance. His achievements in sport and culture were all the more impressive given the barriers of racism he had to surmount. Robeson brought Negro spirituals into the American mainstream. He was among the first artists to refuse to perform to segregated audiences. Historian Penny Von Eschen wrote that while McCarthyism curbed American anti-colonialist politics in the 1940s such as Robeson&#x27;s, &quot;the [African independence movements] of the late 1950s and 1960s would vindicate his anti-colonial [agenda].&quot;

In 1945, he received the Spingarn medal from the NAACP. Several public and private establishments he was associated with have been landmarked, or named after him.

In 1950, Robeson was awarded the International Peace Prize for his &quot;Songs of Peace&quot;.

His efforts to end Apartheid in South Africa were posthumously rewarded in 1978 by the United Nations General Assembly. &quot;Paul Robeson: Tribute to an Artist&quot; won an Academy Award for best short documentary in 1980. In 1995, he was named to the College Football Hall of Fame. In the centenary of his birth, which was commemorated around the world, he was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award, as well as a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Robeson is also a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame.

, the run of &quot;Othello&quot; starring Robeson was the longest-running production of a Shakespeare play ever staged on Broadway. He received a Donaldson Award for his performance. His Othello was characterised by Michael A. Morrison in 2011 as a high point in Shakespearean theatre in the 20th century. In 1930, while performing &quot;Othello&quot; in London, Robeson was painted by the British artist Glyn Philpot; this portrait was sold in 1944 under the title &quot;Head of a Negro&quot; and thereafter thought lost, but was rediscovered by Simon Martin, the director of the Pallant House Gallery, for an exhibition held there in 2022.

Robeson archives exist at the Academy of Arts; Howard University, and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. In 2010, Susan Robeson launched a project at Swansea University, supported the Welsh Assembly, to create an online learning resource in her grandfather&#x27;s memory.

In 1976, the apartment building on Edgecombe Avenue in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan where Robeson lived during the early 1940s was officially renamed the Paul Robeson Residence, and declared a National Historic Landmark. In 1993, the building was designated a New York City landmark as well. Edgecombe Avenue itself was later co-named Paul Robeson Boulevard.

In 1978, the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union announced that the Latvian Shipping Company had named one of its new 40,000-ton tankers &quot;Paul Robeson&quot; in honor of the singer. The agency said the ship&#x27;s crew established a Robeson museum aboard the tanker. After Robeson&#x27;s death, a street in the Prenzlauer Berg district of East Berlin was renamed Paul-Robeson-Straße, and the street name remains in reunified Berlin. An East German stamp featuring Robeson&#x27;s face was issued with the text &quot;For Peace Against Racism, Paul Robeson 1898–1976.&quot;

In 2001, &quot;(Here I Stand) In the Spirit of Paul Robeson&quot;, a public artwork by American artist Allen Uzikee Nelson, was dedicated in the Petworth neighborhood in Washington, D.C.

In 2002, a blue plaque was unveiled by English Heritage on the house in Branch Hill, Hampstead where Robeson lived in 1929–30. On May 18, 2002, a memorial concert celebrating the 50th anniversary of Robeson&#x27;s concert across the Canadian border took place on the same spot at Peace Park in Vancouver.

In 2004, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 37-cent stamp honoring Robeson. In 2006, a plaque was unveiled in his honor at the University of London&#x27;s School of Oriental and African Studies. In 2007, the Criterion Collection, a company that specializes in releasing special-edition versions of classic and contemporary films, released a DVD boxed set of Robeson films. In 2009, Robeson was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

The main campus library at Rutgers University-Camden is named after Robeson, as is the campus center at Rutgers University-Newark. The Paul Robeson Cultural Center is on the campus of Rutgers University, New Brunswick.

In 1972, Penn State established a formal cultural center on the University Park campus. Students and staff chose to name the center for Robeson. A street in Princeton, New Jersey, is named after him. In addition, the block of Davenport Street in Somerville, New Jersey, where St. Thomas AME Zion Church still stands, is called Paul Robeson Boulevard. In West Philadelphia, the Paul Robeson High School is named after him. To celebrate the 100th anniversary of Robeson&#x27;s graduation, Rutgers University named an open-air plaza after him on Friday, April 12, 2019. The plaza, next to the Voorhees Mall on the College Avenue campus at Rutgers, New Brunswick, features eight black granite panels with details of Robeson&#x27;s life.

On March 6, 2019, the city council of New Brunswick, New Jersey, approved the renaming of Commercial Avenue to Paul Robeson Boulevard.

A dark red heirloom tomato from the Soviet Union was given the name Paul Robeson.

===In popular culture===
In 1949, some Chinese editors published children cartoons presenting him as an artistic and revolutionary hero. In contemporary China, Robeson continues to be praised for his art and as a friend to China, including for his role in globalizing the &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot;.

In 1954, the Kurdish poet Abdulla Goran wrote the poem (&quot;A Call for Paul Robeson&quot;). In the same year, another Kurdish poet, Cegerxwîn, also wrote a poem about him, (&quot;Comrade Paul Robeson&quot;), which was put to music by singer Şivan Perwer in 1976.

Black 47&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;Home of the Brave&quot; includes the song &quot;Paul Robeson (Born to Be Free)&quot;, which features spoken quotes of Robeson as part of the song. These quotes are drawn from Robeson&#x27;s testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee in June 1956.

In 2001, Welsh rock band Manic Street Preachers released a song titled &quot;Let Robeson Sing&quot; as a tribute to Robeson, which reached number 19 on the UK Singles Chart.

In January 1978, James Earl Jones performed the one-man show &quot;Paul Robeson&quot;, written by Phillip Hayes Dean, on Broadway. This stage drama was made into a TV movie in 1979, starring Jones and directed by Lloyd Richards.

At the 2007 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, British-Nigerian actor Tayo Aluko, himself a baritone soloist, premiered his one-man show, &quot;Call Mr. Robeson: A Life with Songs&quot;, which has since toured various countries.

A fictional Paul Robeson appears in &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; episode &quot;Winds of Change&quot; as a friend of Indiana Jones.

World Inferno Friendship Society had a semi-biographical song about Paul Robeson&#x27;s life on their 2006 album &quot;Red Eyed Soul&quot;.

Tom Rob Smith&#x27;s novel &quot;Agent 6&quot; (2012) includes the character Jesse Austin, &quot;a black singer, political activist and communist sympathizer modeled after real-life actor/activist Paul Robeson.&quot; Robeson also appears in short fiction published in the online literary magazines the &quot;Maple Tree Literary Supplement&quot; and &quot;Every Day Fiction&quot;.

Film director Steve McQueen&#x27;s video work &quot;End Credits&quot; (2012–ongoing), shown at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Tate Modern, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Pérez Art Museum Miami, reproduces Robeson&#x27;s declassified, although still heavily redacted, FBI files.

On September 7, 2019, Crossroads Theatre Company performed Phillip Hayes Dean&#x27;s play &quot;Paul Robeson&quot; in the inaugural performance of the New Brunswick Performing Arts Center.

Robeson was widely popular among Indian intellectuals and artists. Noted Indian singer-songwriter, Dr. Bhupen Hazarika met Robeson in 1949, befriended him and participated in civil rights activities. Hazarika based his iconic Assamese song &quot;Bistirno Parore&quot; (&quot;Of the wide shores&quot;) on Robeson&#x27;s &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;, later translated into Bengali, Hindi, Nepali and Sanskrit. Singer-songwriter Hemanga Biswas sang the Bengali ballad &quot;Negro bhai amar Paul Robeson&quot; (&quot;Our Negro brother Paul Robeson&quot;). There were nation-wide celebrations in India on Robeson&#x27;s 60th birthday in 1958, with the then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru saying: &quot;This occasion deserves celebration…because Paul Robeson is one of the greatest artistes of our generation.&quot;

A jazz poetry opera, &quot;Paul Robeson: Man of the People&quot; by Lasana Katembe and Ernest Dawkins debuted at The Cabaret in Indianapolis, Indiana on May 31, 2024, and will have its Chicago premiere on June 7, 2024.

<doc id="23230" wikidata="Q12980" url="?curid=23230" title="Polaris">
<text>Polaris is a star in the northern circumpolar constellation of Ursa Minor. It is designated α Ursae Minoris (Latinized to &quot;Alpha Ursae Minoris&quot;) and is commonly called the North Star or Pole Star. With an apparent magnitude that fluctuates around 1.98, it is the brightest star in the constellation and is readily visible to the naked eye at night. The position of the star lies less than 1° away from the north celestial pole, making it the current northern pole star. The stable position of the star in the Northern Sky makes it useful for navigation.

As the closest Cepheid variable its distance is used as part of the cosmic distance ladder. The revised &quot;Hipparcos&quot; stellar parallax gives a distance to Polaris of about , while the successor mission &quot;Gaia&quot; gives a distance of about . Calculations by other methods vary widely.

Although appearing to the naked eye as a single point of light, Polaris is a triple star system, composed of the primary, a yellow supergiant designated Polaris Aa, in orbit with a smaller companion, Polaris Ab; the pair is in a wider orbit with Polaris B. The outer pair AB were discovered in August 1779 by William Herschel, where the &#x27;A&#x27; refers to what is now known to be the Aa/Ab pair.

==Stellar system==

Polaris Aa is an evolved yellow supergiant of spectral type F7Ib with 5.4 solar masses (). It is the first classical Cepheid to have a mass determined from its orbit. The two smaller companions are Polaris B, a F3 main-sequence star orbiting at a distance of (AU), and Polaris Ab (or P), a very close F6 main-sequence star with a mass of . Polaris B can be resolved with a modest telescope. William Herschel discovered the star in August 1779 using a reflecting telescope of his own, one of the best telescopes of the time. In January 2006, NASA released images, from the Hubble telescope, that showed the three members of the Polaris ternary system.

The variable radial velocity of Polaris A was reported by W. W. Campbell in 1899, which suggested this star is a binary system. Since Polaris A is a known cepheid variable, J. H. Moore in 1927 demonstrated that the changes in velocity along the line of sight were due to a combination of the four-day pulsation period combined with a much longer orbital period and a large eccentricity of around 0.6. Moore published preliminary orbital elements of the system in 1929, giving an orbital period of about 29.7 years with an eccentricity of 0.63. This period was confirmed by proper motion studies performed by B. P. Gerasimovič in 1939.

As part of her doctoral thesis, in 1955 E. Roemer used radial velocity data to derive an orbital period of 30.46 y for the Polaris A system, with an eccentricity of 0.64. K. W. Kamper in 1996 produced refined elements with a period of and an eccentricity of . In 2019, a study by R. I. Anderson gave a period of with an eccentricity of .

There were once thought to be two more widely separated components—Polaris C and Polaris D—but these have been shown not to be physically associated with the Polaris system.

== Observation ==

===Variability===

Polaris Aa, the supergiant primary component, is a low-amplitude Population I classical Cepheid variable, although it was once thought to be a type II Cepheid due to its high galactic latitude. Cepheids constitute an important standard candle for determining distance, so Polaris, as the closest such star, is heavily studied. The variability of Polaris had been suspected since 1852; this variation was confirmed by Ejnar Hertzsprung in 1911.

The range of brightness of Polaris is given as 1.86–2.13, but the amplitude has changed since discovery. Prior to 1963, the amplitude was over 0.1 magnitude and was very gradually decreasing. After 1966, it very rapidly decreased until it was less than 0.05 magnitude; since then, it has erratically varied near that range. It has been reported that the amplitude is now increasing again, a reversal not seen in any other Cepheid.
The period, roughly 4 days, has also changed over time. It has steadily increased by around 4.5 seconds per year except for a hiatus in 1963–1965. This was originally thought to be due to secular redward (a long term change in redshift that causes light to stretch into longer wavelengths, causing it to appear red) evolution across the Cepheid instability strip, but it may be due to interference between the primary and the first-overtone pulsation modes. Authors disagree on whether Polaris is a fundamental or first-overtone pulsator and on whether it is crossing the instability strip for the first time or not.

The temperature of Polaris varies by only a small amount during its pulsations, but the amount of this variation is variable and unpredictable. The erratic changes of temperature and the amplitude of temperature changes during each cycle, from less than 50 K to at least 170 K, may be related to the orbit with Polaris Ab.

Research reported in &quot;Science&quot; suggests that Polaris is 2.5 times brighter today than when Ptolemy observed it, changing from third to second magnitude. Astronomer Edward Guinan considers this to be a remarkable change and is on record as saying that &quot;if they are real, these changes are 100 times larger than [those] predicted by current theories of stellar evolution&quot;.

In 2024, researchers led by Nancy Evans at the Harvard &amp; Smithsonian, have studied with more accuracy the Polaris&#x27; smaller companion orbit using the CHARA Array. During this observation campaign they have succeeded in shooting Polaris features on its surface; large bright places and dark ones have appeared in close-up images, changing over time. Further, Polaris diameter size has been re-measured to , using the &quot;Gaia&quot; distance of light-years, and its mass was determined at .

===Role as pole star===


Because Polaris lies nearly in a direct line with the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis &quot;above&quot; the North Pole—the north celestial pole—Polaris stands almost motionless in the sky, and all the stars of the northern sky appear to rotate around it. Therefore, it makes an excellent fixed point from which to draw measurements for celestial navigation and for astrometry. The elevation of the star above the horizon gives the approximate latitude of the observer.

In 2018 Polaris was 0.66° (39.6 arcminutes) away from the pole of rotation (1.4 times the Moon disc) and so revolves around the pole in a small circle 1.3° in diameter. It will be closest to the pole (about 0.45 degree, or 27 arcminutes) soon after the year 2100. Because it is so close to the celestial north pole, its right ascension is changing rapidly due to the precession of Earth&#x27;s axis, going from 2.5h in AD 2000 to 6h in AD 2100. Twice in each sidereal day Polaris&#x27;s azimuth is true north; the rest of the time it is displaced eastward or westward, and the bearing must be corrected using tables or a rule of thumb. The best approximation is made using the leading edge of the &quot;Big Dipper&quot; asterism in the constellation Ursa Major. The leading edge (defined by the stars Dubhe and Merak) is referenced to a clock face, and the true azimuth of Polaris worked out for different latitudes.

The apparent motion of Polaris towards and, in the future, away from the celestial pole, is due to the precession of the equinoxes. The celestial pole will move away from α UMi after the 21st century, passing close by Gamma Cephei by about the 41st century, moving towards Deneb by about the 91st century.

The celestial pole was close to Thuban around 2750 BCE, and during classical antiquity it was slightly closer to Kochab (β UMi) than to Polaris, although still about from either star. It was about the same angular distance from β UMi as to α UMi by the end of late antiquity. The Greek navigator Pytheas in ca. 320 BC described the celestial pole as devoid of stars. However, as one of the brighter stars close to the celestial pole, Polaris was used for navigation at least from late antiquity, and described as ἀεί φανής (&quot;aei phanēs&quot;) &quot;always visible&quot; by Stobaeus (5th century), also termed Λύχνος (&quot;Lychnos&quot;) akin to a burner or lamp and would reasonably be described as &quot;stella polaris&quot; from about the High Middle Ages and onwards, both in Greek and Latin. On his first trans-Atlantic voyage in 1492, Christopher Columbus had to correct for the &quot;circle described by the pole star about the pole&quot;. In Shakespeare&#x27;s play Julius Caesar, written around 1599, Caesar describes himself as being &quot;as constant as the northern star&quot;, although in Caesar&#x27;s time there was no constant northern star. Despite its relative brightness, it is not, as is popularly believed, the brightest star in the sky.

Polaris was referenced in the classic Nathaniel Bowditch maritime navigation book &quot;American Practical Navigator&quot; (1802), where it is listed as one of the navigational stars.

==Names==

The modern name &quot;Polaris&quot; is shortened from the Neo-Latin &quot;stella polaris&quot; (&quot;polar star&quot;), coined in the Renaissance when the star had approached the celestial pole to within a few degrees.

Gemma Frisius, writing in 1547, referred to it as &quot;stella illa quae polaris dicitur&quot; (&quot;that star which is called &#x27;polar&#x27;&quot;), placing it 3° 8&#x27; from the celestial pole.

In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Polaris&quot; for the star α Ursae Minoris Aa.

In antiquity, Polaris was not yet the closest naked-eye star to the celestial pole, and the entire constellation of Ursa Minor was used for navigation rather than any single star. Polaris moved close enough to the pole to be the closest naked-eye star, even though still at a distance of several degrees, in the early medieval period, and numerous names referring to this characteristic as polar star have been in use since the medieval period. In Old English, it was known as &quot;scip-steorra&quot; (&quot;ship-star&quot;).

In the &quot;Old English rune poem&quot;, the T-rune is apparently associated with &quot;a circumpolar constellation&quot;, or the planet Mars.

In the Hindu Puranas, it became personified under the name &quot;Dhruva&quot; (&quot;immovable, fixed&quot;).

In the later medieval period, it became associated with the Marian title of &quot;Stella Maris&quot; &quot;Star of the Sea&quot; (so in Bartholomaeus Anglicus, c. 1270s), due to an earlier transcription error.

An older English name, attested since the 14th century, is lodestar &quot;guiding star&quot;, cognate with the Old Norse &quot;leiðarstjarna&quot;, Middle High German &quot;leitsterne&quot;.

The ancient name of the constellation Ursa Minor, &quot;Cynosura&quot; (from the Greek &quot;the dog&#x27;s tail&quot;), became associated with the pole star in particular by the early modern period. An explicit identification of Mary as &quot;stella maris&quot; with the polar star (&quot;Stella Polaris&quot;), as well as the use of &quot;Cynosura&quot; as a name of the star, is evident in the title &quot;Cynosura seu Mariana Stella Polaris&quot; (i.e. &quot;Cynosure, or the Marian Polar Star&quot;), a collection of Marian poetry published by Nicolaus Lucensis (Niccolo Barsotti de Lucca) in 1655. 
Its name in traditional pre-Islamic Arab astronomy was &quot;al-Judayy&quot; الجدي (&quot;the kid&quot;, in the sense of a juvenile goat [&quot;le Chevreau&quot;] in Description des Etoiles fixes), and that name was used in medieval Islamic astronomy as well. In those times, it was not yet as close to the north celestial pole as it is now, and used to rotate around the pole.

It was invoked as a symbol of steadfastness in poetry, as &quot;steadfast star&quot; by Spenser.
Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnet 116 is an example of the symbolism of the north star as a guiding principle: &quot;[Love] is the star to every wandering bark / Whose worth&#x27;s unknown, although his height be taken.&quot;

In &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, Shakespeare has Caesar explain his refusal to grant a pardon: &quot;I am as constant as the northern star/Of whose true-fixed and resting quality/There is no fellow in the firmament./The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks,/They are all fire and every one doth shine,/But there&#x27;s but one in all doth hold his place;/So in the world&quot; (III, i, 65–71). Of course, Polaris will not &quot;constantly&quot; remain as the north star due to precession, but this is only noticeable over centuries.
In Inuit astronomy, Polaris is known as &quot;Nuutuittuq&quot; (: ).

In traditional Lakota star knowledge, Polaris is named &quot;Wičháȟpi Owáŋžila&quot;. This translates to &quot;The Star that Sits Still&quot;. This name comes from a Lakota story in which he married Tȟapȟúŋ Šá Wíŋ, &quot;Red Cheeked Woman&quot;. However, she fell from the heavens, and in his grief Wičháȟpi Owáŋžila stared down from &quot;waŋkátu&quot; (the above land) forever.

The Plains Cree call the star in Nehiyawewin: &quot;acâhkos êkâ kâ-âhcît&quot; &quot;the star that does not move&quot; (: ).

In Mi&#x27;kmawi&#x27;simk the star is named &quot;Tatapn&quot;.

In the ancient Finnish worldview, the North Star has also been called &quot;taivaannapa&quot; and &quot;naulatähti&quot; (&quot;the nailstar&quot;) because it seems to be attached to the firmament or even to act as a fastener for the sky when other stars orbit it. Since the starry sky seemed to rotate around it, the firmament is thought of as a wheel, with the star as the pivot on its axis. The names derived from it were &quot;sky pin&quot; and &quot;world pin&quot;.

Many recent papers calculate the distance to Polaris at about 433 light-years (133 parsecs), based on parallax measurements from the Hipparcos astrometry satellite. Older distance estimates were often slightly less, and research based on high resolution spectral analysis suggests it may be up to 110 light years closer (323 ly/99 pc). Polaris is the closest Cepheid variable to Earth so its physical parameters are of critical importance to the whole astronomical distance scale. It is also the only one with a dynamically measured mass.


The &quot;Hipparcos&quot; spacecraft used stellar parallax to take measurements from 1989 and 1993 with the accuracy of 0.97 milliarcseconds (970 microarcseconds), and it obtained accurate measurements for stellar distances up to 1,000 pc away. The Hipparcos data was examined again with more advanced error correction and statistical techniques. Despite the advantages of Hipparcos astrometry, the uncertainty in its Polaris data has been pointed out and some researchers have questioned the accuracy of Hipparcos when measuring binary Cepheids like Polaris. The Hipparcos reduction specifically for Polaris has been re-examined and reaffirmed but there is still not widespread agreement about the distance.

The next major step in high precision parallax measurements comes from &quot;Gaia&quot;, a space astrometry mission launched in 2013 and intended to measure stellar parallax to within 25 microarcseconds (μas). Although it was originally planned to limit Gaia&#x27;s observations to stars fainter than magnitude 5.7, tests carried out during the commissioning phase indicated that Gaia could autonomously identify stars as bright as magnitude 3. When Gaia entered regular scientific operations in July 2014, it was configured to routinely process stars in the magnitude range 3 – 20. Beyond that limit, special procedures are used to download raw scanning data for the remaining 230 stars brighter than magnitude 3; methods to reduce and analyse these data are being developed; and it is expected that there will be &quot;complete sky coverage at the bright end&quot; with standard errors of &quot;a few dozen μas&quot;. Gaia Data Release 2 does not include a parallax for Polaris, but a distance inferred from it is (445.5 ly) for Polaris B, somewhat further than most previous estimates and several times more accurate. This was further improved to (447.6 ly), upon publication of the Gaia Data Release 3 catalog on 13 June 2022 which superseded Gaia Data Release 2.

==In popular culture==
Polaris is depicted in the flag and coat of arms of the Canadian Inuit territory of Nunavut, the flag of the U.S. states of Alaska and Minnesota, and the flag of the U.S. city of Duluth, Minnesota.

<doc id="23231" wikidata="Q48297" url="?curid=23231" title="Parabola">
<text>In mathematics, a parabola is a plane curve which is mirror-symmetrical and is approximately U-shaped. It fits several superficially different mathematical descriptions, which can all be proved to define exactly the same curves.

One description of a parabola involves a point (the focus) and a line (the directrix). The focus does not lie on the directrix. The parabola is the locus of points in that plane that are equidistant from the directrix and the focus. Another description of a parabola is as a conic section, created from the intersection of a right circular conical surface and a plane parallel to another plane that is tangential to the conical surface.

The graph of a quadratic function formula_1 (with formula_2) is a parabola with its axis parallel to the -axis. Conversely, every such parabola is the graph of a quadratic function.

The line perpendicular to the directrix and passing through the focus (that is, the line that splits the parabola through the middle) is called the &quot;axis of symmetry&quot;. The point where the parabola intersects its axis of symmetry is called the &quot;vertex&quot; and is the point where the parabola is most sharply curved. The distance between the vertex and the focus, measured along the axis of symmetry, is the &quot;focal length&quot;. The &quot;latus rectum&quot; is the chord of the parabola that is parallel to the directrix and passes through the focus. Parabolas can open up, down, left, right, or in some other arbitrary direction. Any parabola can be repositioned and rescaled to fit exactly on any other parabola—that is, all parabolas are geometrically similar.

Parabolas have the property that, if they are made of material that reflects light, then light that travels parallel to the axis of symmetry of a parabola and strikes its concave side is reflected to its focus, regardless of where on the parabola the reflection occurs. Conversely, light that originates from a point source at the focus is reflected into a parallel (&quot;collimated&quot;) beam, leaving the parabola parallel to the axis of symmetry. The same effects occur with sound and other waves. This reflective property is the basis of many practical uses of parabolas.

The parabola has many important applications, from a parabolic antenna or parabolic microphone to automobile headlight reflectors and the design of ballistic missiles. It is frequently used in physics, engineering, and many other areas.

== History ==

The earliest known work on conic sections was by Menaechmus in the 4th century BC. He discovered a way to solve the problem of doubling the cube using parabolas. (The solution, however, does not meet the requirements of compass-and-straightedge construction.) The area enclosed by a parabola and a line segment, the so-called &quot;parabola segment&quot;, was computed by Archimedes by the method of exhaustion in the 3rd century BC, in his &quot;The Quadrature of the Parabola&quot;. The name &quot;parabola&quot; is due to Apollonius, who discovered many properties of conic sections. It means &quot;application&quot;, referring to &quot;application of areas&quot; concept, that has a connection with this curve, as Apollonius had proved. The focus–directrix property of the parabola and other conic sections was mentioned in the works of Pappus.

Galileo showed that the path of a projectile follows a parabola, a consequence of uniform acceleration due to gravity.

The idea that a parabolic reflector could produce an image was already well known before the invention of the reflecting telescope. Designs were proposed in the early to mid-17th century by many mathematicians, including René Descartes, Marin Mersenne, and James Gregory. When Isaac Newton built the first reflecting telescope in 1668, he skipped using a parabolic mirror because of the difficulty of fabrication, opting for a spherical mirror. Parabolic mirrors are used in most modern reflecting telescopes and in satellite dishes and radar receivers.
== Definition as a locus of points ==
A parabola can be defined geometrically as a set of points (locus of points) in the Euclidean plane:

The midpoint formula_3 of the perpendicular from the focus formula_4 onto the directrix formula_5 is called the &quot;vertex&quot;, and the line formula_6 is the &quot;axis of symmetry&quot; of the parabola.

== In a Cartesian coordinate system ==
=== Axis of symmetry parallel to the &quot;y&quot; axis ===

If one introduces Cartesian coordinates, such that formula_7 and the directrix has the equation formula_8, one obtains for a point formula_9 from formula_10 the equation formula_11. Solving for formula_12 yields
formula_13

This parabola is U-shaped (&quot;opening to the top&quot;).

The horizontal chord through the focus (see picture in opening section) is called the &quot;latus rectum&quot;; one half of it is the &quot;semi-latus rectum&quot;. The latus rectum is parallel to the directrix. The semi-latus rectum is designated by the letter formula_14. From the picture one obtains 
formula_15

The latus rectum is defined similarly for the other two conics – the ellipse and the hyperbola. The latus rectum is the line drawn through a focus of a conic section parallel to the directrix and terminated both ways by the curve. For any case, formula_14 is the radius of the osculating circle at the vertex. For a parabola, the semi-latus rectum, formula_14, is the distance of the focus from the directrix. Using the parameter formula_14, the equation of the parabola can be rewritten as
formula_19

More generally, if the vertex is formula_20, the focus formula_21, and the directrix formula_22, one obtains the equation
formula_23

Remarks:
# In the case of formula_24 the parabola has a downward opening.
# The presumption that the &quot;axis is parallel to the y axis&quot; allows one to consider a parabola as the graph of a polynomial of degree 2, and conversely: the graph of an arbitrary polynomial of degree 2 is a parabola (see next section).
# If one exchanges formula_25 and formula_12, one obtains equations of the form formula_27. These parabolas open to the left (if formula_28) or to the right (if formula_29).

=== General position ===

If the focus is formula_30, and the directrix formula_31, then one obtains the equation
formula_32

(the left side of the equation uses the Hesse normal form of a line to calculate the distance formula_33).

For a parametric equation of a parabola in general position see .

The implicit equation of a parabola is defined by an irreducible polynomial of degree two:
formula_34
such that formula_35 or, equivalently, such that formula_36 is the square of a linear polynomial.

== As a graph of a function ==

The previous section shows that any parabola with the origin as vertex and the &quot;y&quot; axis as axis of symmetry can be considered as the graph of a function
formula_37

For formula_38 the parabolas are opening to the top, and for formula_39 are opening to the bottom (see picture). From the section above one obtains:
* The &quot;focus &quot; is formula_40,
* the &quot;focal length&quot; formula_41, the &quot;semi-latus rectum&quot; is formula_42,
* the &quot;vertex&quot; is formula_43,
* the &quot;directrix&quot; has the equation formula_44,
* the &quot;tangent&quot; at point formula_45 has the equation formula_46.

For formula_47 the parabola is the unit parabola with equation formula_48.
Its focus is formula_49, the semi-latus rectum formula_50, and the directrix has the equation formula_51.

The general function of degree 2 is
formula_52
Completing the square yields
formula_53
which is the equation of a parabola with
* the axis formula_54 (parallel to the &quot;y&quot; axis),
* the &quot;focal length&quot; formula_41, the &quot;semi-latus rectum&quot; formula_42,
* the &quot;vertex&quot; formula_57,
* the &quot;focus&quot; formula_58,
* the &quot;directrix&quot; formula_59,
* the point of the parabola intersecting the &quot;y&quot; axis has coordinates formula_60,
* the &quot;tangent&quot; at a point on the &quot;y&quot; axis has the equation formula_61.

== Similarity to the unit parabola ==

Two objects in the Euclidean plane are &quot;similar&quot; if one can be transformed to the other by a &quot;similarity&quot;, that is, an arbitrary composition of rigid motions (translations and rotations) and uniform scalings.

A parabola formula_62 with vertex formula_20 can be transformed by the translation formula_64 to one with the origin as vertex. A suitable rotation around the origin can then transform the parabola to one that has the axis as axis of symmetry. Hence the parabola formula_62 can be transformed by a rigid motion to a parabola with an equation formula_66. Such a parabola can then be transformed by the uniform scaling formula_67 into the unit parabola with equation formula_48. Thus, any parabola can be mapped to the unit parabola by a similarity.

A synthetic approach, using similar triangles, can also be used to establish this result.

The general result is that two conic sections (necessarily of the same type) are similar if and only if they have the same eccentricity. Therefore, only circles (all having eccentricity 0) share this property with parabolas (all having eccentricity 1), while general ellipses and hyperbolas do not.

There are other simple affine transformations that map the parabola formula_69 onto the unit parabola, such as formula_70. But this mapping is not a similarity, and only shows that all parabolas are affinely equivalent (see ).

== As a special conic section ==

The pencil of conic sections with the &quot;x&quot; axis as axis of symmetry, one vertex at the origin (0, 0) and the same semi-latus rectum formula_14 can be represented by the equation 
formula_72
with formula_73 the eccentricity.
* For formula_74 the conic is a &quot;circle&quot; (osculating circle of the pencil),
* for formula_75 an &quot;ellipse&quot;,
* for formula_76 the parabola with equation formula_77
* for formula_78 a hyperbola (see picture).

== In polar coordinates ==

If , the parabola with equation formula_27 (opening to the right) has the polar representation
formula_80
where formula_81.

Its vertex is formula_82, and its focus is formula_83.

If one shifts the origin into the focus, that is, formula_84, one obtains the equation
formula_85

&quot;Remark 1:&quot; Inverting this polar form shows that a parabola is the inverse of a cardioid.

&quot;Remark 2:&quot; The second polar form is a special case of a pencil of conics with focus formula_84 (see picture):
formula_87 (formula_73 is the eccentricity).

== Conic section and quadratic form ==
=== Diagram, description, and definitions ===
The diagram represents a cone with its axis . The point A is its apex. An inclined cross-section of the cone, shown in pink, is inclined from the axis by the same angle , as the side of the cone. According to the definition of a parabola as a conic section, the boundary of this pink cross-section EPD is a parabola.

A cross-section perpendicular to the axis of the cone passes through the vertex P of the parabola. This cross-section is circular, but appears elliptical when viewed obliquely, as is shown in the diagram. Its centre is V, and is a diameter. We will call its radius .

Another perpendicular to the axis, circular cross-section of the cone is farther from the apex A than the one just described. It has a chord , which joins the points where the parabola intersects the circle. Another chord is the perpendicular bisector of and is consequently a diameter of the circle. These two chords and the parabola&#x27;s axis of symmetry all intersect at the point M.

All the labelled points, except D and E, are coplanar. They are in the plane of symmetry of the whole figure. This includes the point F, which is not mentioned above. It is defined and discussed below, in .

Let us call the length of and of , and the length of  .

=== Derivation of quadratic equation ===
The lengths of and are:

Using the intersecting chords theorem on the chords and , we get
formula_89

Substituting:
formula_90

Rearranging:
formula_91

For any given cone and parabola, and are constants, but and are variables that depend on the arbitrary height at which the horizontal cross-section BECD is made. This last equation shows the relationship between these variables. They can be interpreted as Cartesian coordinates of the points D and E, in a system in the pink plane with P as its origin. Since is squared in the equation, the fact that D and E are on opposite sides of the axis is unimportant. If the horizontal cross-section moves up or down, toward or away from the apex of the cone, D and E move along the parabola, always maintaining the relationship between and shown in the equation. The parabolic curve is therefore the locus of points where the equation is satisfied, which makes it a Cartesian graph of the quadratic function in the equation.

=== Focal length ===
It is proved in a preceding section that if a parabola has its vertex at the origin, and if it opens in the positive direction, then its equation is , where is its focal length. Comparing this with the last equation above shows that the focal length of the parabola in the cone is .

=== Position of the focus ===
In the diagram above, the point V is the foot of the perpendicular from the vertex of the parabola to the axis of the cone. &quot;The point F is the foot of the perpendicular from the point V to the plane of the parabola.&quot; By symmetry, F is on the axis of symmetry of the parabola. Angle VPF is complementary to , and angle PVF is complementary to angle VPF, therefore angle PVF is . Since the length of is , the distance of F from the vertex of the parabola is . It is shown above that this distance equals the focal length of the parabola, which is the distance from the vertex to the focus. The focus and the point F are therefore equally distant from the vertex, along the same line, which implies that they are the same point. Therefore, &quot;the point F, defined above, is the focus of the parabola&quot;.

This discussion started from the definition of a parabola as a conic section, but it has now led to a description as a graph of a quadratic function. This shows that these two descriptions are equivalent. They both define curves of exactly the same shape.

=== Alternative proof with Dandelin spheres ===

An alternative proof can be done using Dandelin spheres. It works without calculation and uses elementary geometric considerations only (see the derivation below).

The intersection of an upright cone by a plane formula_92, whose inclination from vertical is the same as a generatrix (a.k.a. generator line, a line containing the apex and a point on the cone surface) formula_93 of the cone, is a parabola (red curve in the diagram).

This generatrix formula_93 is the only generatrix of the cone that is parallel to plane formula_92. Otherwise, if there are two generatrices parallel to the intersecting plane, the intersection curve will be a hyperbola (or degenerate hyperbola, if the two generatrices are in the intersecting plane). If there is no generatrix parallel to the intersecting plane, the intersection curve will be an ellipse or a circle (or a point).

Let plane formula_96 be the plane that contains the vertical axis of the cone and line formula_93. The inclination of plane formula_92 from vertical is the same as line formula_93 means that, viewing from the side (that is, the plane formula_92 is perpendicular to plane formula_96), formula_102.

In order to prove the directrix property of a parabola (see above), one uses a Dandelin sphere formula_103, which is a sphere that touches the cone along a circle formula_104 and plane formula_92 at point formula_4. The plane containing the circle formula_104 intersects with plane formula_92 at line formula_5. There is a mirror symmetry in the system consisting of plane formula_92, Dandelin sphere formula_103 and the cone (the plane of symmetry is formula_96).

Since the plane containing the circle formula_104 is perpendicular to plane formula_96, and formula_115, their intersection line formula_5 must also be perpendicular to plane formula_96. Since line formula_93 is in plane formula_96, formula_120.

It turns out that formula_4 is the &quot;focus&quot; of the parabola, and formula_5 is the &quot;directrix&quot; of the parabola.

# Let formula_123 be an arbitrary point of the intersection curve.
# The generatrix of the cone containing formula_123 intersects circle formula_104 at point formula_126.
# The line segments formula_127 and formula_128 are tangential to the sphere formula_103, and hence are of equal length.
# Generatrix formula_93 intersects the circle formula_104 at point formula_132. The line segments formula_133 and formula_134 are tangential to the sphere formula_103, and hence are of equal length.
# Let line formula_136 be the line parallel to formula_93 and passing through point formula_123. Since formula_102, and point formula_123 is in plane formula_92, line formula_136 must be in plane formula_92. Since formula_144, we know that formula_145 as well.
# Let point formula_146 be &quot;the foot of the perpendicular&quot; from point formula_123 to line formula_5, that is, formula_149 is a segment of line formula_136, and hence formula_151.
# From intercept theorem and formula_152 we know that formula_153. Since formula_154, we know that formula_155, which means that the distance from formula_123 to the focus formula_4 is equal to the distance from formula_123 to the directrix formula_5.

== Proof of the reflective property ==

The reflective property states that if a parabola can reflect light, then light that enters it travelling parallel to the axis of symmetry is reflected toward the focus. This is derived from geometrical optics, based on the assumption that light travels in rays.

Consider the parabola . Since all parabolas are similar, this simple case represents all others.

=== Construction and definitions ===
The point E is an arbitrary point on the parabola. The focus is F, the vertex is A (the origin), and the line is the axis of symmetry. The line is parallel to the axis of symmetry, intersects the axis at D and intersects the directrix at C. The point B is the midpoint of the line segment .

=== Deductions ===
The vertex A is equidistant from the focus F and from the directrix. Since C is on the directrix, the coordinates of F and C are equal in absolute value and opposite in sign. B is the midpoint of . Its coordinate is half that of D, that is, . The slope of the line is the quotient of the lengths of and , which is . But is also the slope (first derivative) of the parabola at E. Therefore, the line is the tangent to the parabola at E.

The distances and are equal because E is on the parabola, F is the focus and C is on the directrix. Therefore, since B is the midpoint of , triangles △FEB and △CEB are congruent (three sides), which implies that the angles marked are congruent. (The angle above E is vertically opposite angle ∠BEC.) This means that a ray of light that enters the parabola and arrives at E travelling parallel to the axis of symmetry will be reflected by the line so it travels along the line , as shown in red in the diagram (assuming that the lines can somehow reflect light). Since is the tangent to the parabola at E, the same reflection will be done by an infinitesimal arc of the parabola at E. Therefore, light that enters the parabola and arrives at E travelling parallel to the axis of symmetry of the parabola is reflected by the parabola toward its focus.

This conclusion about reflected light applies to all points on the parabola, as is shown on the left side of the diagram. This is the reflective property.

=== Other consequences ===
There are other theorems that can be deduced simply from the above argument.

==== Tangent bisection property ====
The above proof and the accompanying diagram show that the tangent bisects the angle ∠FEC. In other words, the tangent to the parabola at any point bisects the angle between the lines joining the point to the focus and perpendicularly to the directrix.

==== Intersection of a tangent and perpendicular from focus ====

Since triangles △FBE and △CBE are congruent, is perpendicular to the tangent . Since B is on the axis, which is the tangent to the parabola at its vertex, it follows that the point of intersection between any tangent to a parabola and the perpendicular from the focus to that tangent lies on the line that is tangential to the parabola at its vertex. See animated diagram and pedal curve.

==== Reflection of light striking the convex side ====
If light travels along the line , it moves parallel to the axis of symmetry and strikes the convex side of the parabola at E. It is clear from the above diagram that this light will be reflected directly away from the focus, along an extension of the segment .

=== Alternative proofs ===

The above proofs of the reflective and tangent bisection properties use a line of calculus. Here a geometric proof is presented.

In this diagram, F is the focus of the parabola, and T and U lie on its directrix. P is an arbitrary point on the parabola. is perpendicular to the directrix, and the line bisects angle ∠FPT. Q is another point on the parabola, with perpendicular to the directrix. We know that  =  and  = . Clearly,  &gt; , so  &gt; . All points on the bisector are equidistant from F and T, but Q is closer to F than to T. This means that Q is to the left of , that is, on the same side of it as the focus. The same would be true if Q were located anywhere else on the parabola (except at the point P), so the entire parabola, except the point P, is on the focus side of . Therefore, is the tangent to the parabola at P. Since it bisects the angle ∠FPT, this proves the tangent bisection property.

The logic of the last paragraph can be applied to modify the above proof of the reflective property. It effectively proves the line to be the tangent to the parabola at E if the angles are equal. The reflective property follows as shown previously.

== Pin and string construction ==

The definition of a parabola by its focus and directrix can be used for drawing it with help of pins and strings:
# Choose the &quot;focus&quot; formula_4 and the &quot;directrix&quot; formula_5 of the parabola.
# Take a triangle of a &quot;set square&quot; and prepare a &quot;string&quot; with length formula_162 (see diagram).
# Pin one end of the string at point formula_126 of the triangle and the other one to the focus formula_4.
# Position the triangle such that the second edge of the right angle is free to &quot;slide&quot; along the directrix.
# Take a &quot;pen&quot; and hold the string tight to the triangle.
# While moving the triangle along the directrix, the pen &quot;draws&quot; an arc of a parabola, because of formula_165 (see definition of a parabola).

== Properties related to Pascal&#x27;s theorem ==
A parabola can be considered as the affine part of a non-degenerated projective conic with a point formula_166 on the line of infinity formula_167, which is the tangent at formula_166. The 5-, 4- and 3- point degenerations of Pascal&#x27;s theorem are properties of a conic dealing with at least one tangent. If one considers this tangent as the line at infinity and its point of contact as the point at infinity of the &quot;y&quot; axis, one obtains three statements for a parabola.

The following properties of a parabola deal only with terms &quot;connect&quot;, &quot;intersect&quot;, &quot;parallel&quot;, which are invariants of similarities. So, it is sufficient to prove any property for the &quot;unit parabola&quot; with equation formula_48.

=== 4-points property ===

Any parabola can be described in a suitable coordinate system by an equation formula_69.

&quot;Proof:&quot; straightforward calculation for the unit parabola formula_48.

&quot;Application:&quot; The 4-points property of a parabola can be used for the construction of point formula_172, while formula_173 and formula_174 are given.

&quot;Remark:&quot; the 4-points property of a parabola is an affine version of the 5-point degeneration of Pascal&#x27;s theorem.

=== 3-points–1-tangent property ===
Let formula_175 be three points of the parabola with equation formula_69 and formula_174 the intersection of the secant line formula_178 with the line formula_179 and formula_180 the intersection of the secant line formula_181 with the line formula_182 (see picture). Then the tangent at point formula_183 is parallel to the line formula_184.
(The lines formula_185 and formula_179 are parallel to the axis of the parabola.)

&quot;Proof:&quot; can be performed for the unit parabola formula_187. A short calculation shows: line formula_188 has slope formula_189 which is the slope of the tangent at point formula_183.

&quot;Application:&quot; The 3-points-1-tangent-property of a parabola can be used for the construction of the tangent at point formula_183, while formula_192 are given.

&quot;Remark:&quot; The 3-points-1-tangent-property of a parabola is an affine version of the 4-point-degeneration of Pascal&#x27;s theorem.

=== 2-points–2-tangents property ===
Let formula_193 be two points of the parabola with equation formula_69, and formula_174 the intersection of the tangent at point formula_196 with the line formula_179, and formula_180 the intersection of the tangent at point formula_199 with the line formula_182 (see picture). Then the secant formula_201 is parallel to the line formula_184.
(The lines formula_182 and formula_179 are parallel to the axis of the parabola.)

&quot;Proof:&quot; straight forward calculation for the unit parabola formula_48.

&quot;Application:&quot; The 2-points–2-tangents property can be used for the construction of the tangent of a parabola at point formula_199, if formula_207 and the tangent at formula_196 are given.

&quot;Remark 1:&quot; The 2-points–2-tangents property of a parabola is an affine version of the 3-point degeneration of Pascal&#x27;s theorem.

&quot;Remark 2:&quot; The 2-points–2-tangents property should not be confused with the following property of a parabola, which also deals with 2 points and 2 tangents, but is &quot;not&quot; related to Pascal&#x27;s theorem.

=== Axis direction ===
The statements above presume the knowledge of the axis direction of the parabola, in order to construct the points formula_209. The following property determines the points formula_209 by two given points and their tangents only, and the result is that the line formula_184 is parallel to the axis of the parabola.

Let
# formula_193 be two points of the parabola formula_69, and formula_214 be their tangents;
# formula_180 be the intersection of the tangents formula_214,
# formula_174 be the intersection of the parallel line to formula_218 through formula_199 with the parallel line to formula_220 through formula_196 (see picture).
Then the line formula_184 is parallel to the axis of the parabola and has the equation formula_223

&quot;Proof:&quot; can be done (like the properties above) for the unit parabola formula_48.

&quot;Application:&quot; This property can be used to determine the direction of the axis of a parabola, if two points and their tangents are given. An alternative way is to determine the midpoints of two parallel chords, see section on parallel chords.

&quot;Remark:&quot; This property is an affine version of the theorem of two &quot;perspective triangles&quot; of a non-degenerate conic.

Related: Chord formula_201 has two additional properties:
# Its slope is the arithmetic average of the slopes of tangents formula_218 and formula_220.
# It is parallel to the tangent at the intersection of formula_228 with the parabola.

== Steiner generation ==
=== Parabola ===
Steiner established the following procedure for the construction of a non-degenerate conic (see Steiner conic):
This procedure can be used for a simple construction of points on the parabola formula_69:
* Consider the pencil at the vertex formula_230 and the set of lines formula_231 that are parallel to the &quot;y&quot; axis.
*# Let formula_232 be a point on the parabola, and formula_233, formula_234.
*# The line segment formula_235 is divided into &quot;n&quot; equally spaced segments, and this division is projected (in the direction formula_236) onto the line segment formula_237 (see figure). This projection gives rise to a projective mapping formula_92 from pencil formula_239 onto the pencil formula_231.
*# The intersection of the line formula_241 and the &quot;i&quot;-th parallel to the &quot;y&quot; axis is a point on the parabola.

&quot;Proof:&quot; straightforward calculation.

&quot;Remark:&quot; Steiner&#x27;s generation is also available for ellipses and hyperbolas.

=== Dual parabola ===
A &quot;dual parabola&quot; consists of the set of tangents of an ordinary parabola.

The Steiner generation of a conic can be applied to the generation of a dual conic by changing the meanings of points and lines:
In order to generate elements of a dual parabola, one starts with
# three points formula_242 not on a line,
# divides the line sections formula_243 and formula_244 each into formula_245 equally spaced line segments and adds numbers as shown in the picture.
# Then the lines formula_246 are tangents of a parabola, hence elements of a dual parabola.
# The parabola is a Bézier curve of degree 2 with the control points formula_242.

The &quot;proof&quot; is a consequence of the &quot;de Casteljau algorithm&quot; for a Bézier curve of degree 2.

== Inscribed angles and the 3-point form ==

A parabola with equation formula_248 is uniquely determined by three points formula_249 with different &quot;x&quot; coordinates. The usual procedure to determine the coefficients formula_250 is to insert the point coordinates into the equation. The result is a linear system of three equations, which can be solved by Gaussian elimination or Cramer&#x27;s rule, for example. An alternative way uses the &quot;inscribed angle theorem&quot; for parabolas.

In the following, the angle of two lines will be measured by the difference of the slopes of the line with respect to the directrix of the parabola. That is, for a parabola of equation formula_251 the angle between two lines of equations formula_252 is measured by formula_253

Analogous to the inscribed angle theorem for circles, one has the &quot;inscribed angle theorem for parabolas&quot;:
(Proof: straightforward calculation: If the points are on a parabola, one may translate the coordinates for having the equation formula_69, then one has formula_255 if the points are on the parabola.)

A consequence is that the equation (in formula_256) of the parabola determined by 3 points formula_257 with different coordinates is (if two coordinates are equal, there is no parabola with directrix parallel to the axis, which passes through the points)
formula_258
Multiplying by the denominators that depend on formula_259 one obtains the more standard form
formula_260

== Pole–polar relation ==

In a suitable coordinate system any parabola can be described by an equation formula_69. The equation of the tangent at a point formula_262 is
formula_263
One obtains the function
formula_264
on the set of points of the parabola onto the set of tangents.

Obviously, this function can be extended onto the set of all points of formula_265 to a bijection between the points of formula_265 and the lines with equations formula_267. The inverse mapping is 
formula_268
This relation is called the &quot;pole–polar relation of the parabola&quot;, where the point is the &quot;pole&quot;, and the corresponding line its &quot;polar&quot;.

By calculation, one checks the following properties of the pole–polar relation of the parabola:
* For a point (pole) &quot;on&quot; the parabola, the polar is the tangent at this point (see picture: formula_269).
* For a pole formula_123 &quot;outside&quot; the parabola the intersection points of its polar with the parabola are the touching points of the two tangents passing formula_123 (see picture: formula_272).
* For a point &quot;within&quot; the parabola the polar has no point with the parabola in common (see picture: formula_273 and formula_274).
* The intersection point of two polar lines (see picture: formula_275) is the pole of the connecting line of their poles (see picture: formula_276).
* Focus and directrix of the parabola are a pole–polar pair.

&quot;Remark:&quot; Pole–polar relations also exist for ellipses and hyperbolas.

== Tangent properties ==
=== Two tangent properties related to the latus rectum ===
Let the line of symmetry intersect the parabola at point Q, and denote the focus as point F and its distance from point Q as {{mvar|f}}. Let the perpendicular to the line of symmetry, through the focus, intersect the parabola at a point T. Then (1) the distance from F to T is {{math|2&quot;f&quot;}}, and (2) a tangent to the parabola at point T intersects the line of symmetry at a 45° angle.{{rp|p=26}}
=== Orthoptic property ===
{{main|Orthoptic (geometry)}}
If two tangents to a parabola are perpendicular to each other, then they intersect on the directrix. Conversely, two tangents that intersect on the directrix are perpendicular. In other words, at any point on the directrix the whole parabola subtends a right angle.

=== Lambert&#x27;s theorem ===
Let three tangents to a parabola form a triangle. Then Lambert&#x27;s theorem states that the focus of the parabola lies on the circumcircle of the triangle.{{rp|at=Corollary 20}}

Tsukerman&#x27;s converse to Lambert&#x27;s theorem states that, given three lines that bound a triangle, if two of the lines are tangent to a parabola whose focus lies on the circumcircle of the triangle, then the third line is also tangent to the parabola.

== Facts related to chords and arcs {{anchor|Chords|Arcs}} ==

=== Focal length calculated from parameters of a chord ===
Suppose a chord crosses a parabola perpendicular to its axis of symmetry. Let the length of the chord between the points where it intersects the parabola be {{mvar|c}} and the distance from the vertex of the parabola to the chord, measured along the axis of symmetry, be {{mvar|d}}. The focal length, {{mvar|f}}, of the parabola is given by
formula_277

{{math proof | proof = Suppose a system of Cartesian coordinates is used such that the vertex of the parabola is at the origin, and the axis of symmetry is the {{mvar|y}} axis. The parabola opens upward. It is shown elsewhere in this article that the equation of the parabola is {{math|1=4&quot;fy&quot; = &quot;x&quot;2}}, where {{mvar|f}} is the focal length. At the positive {{mvar|x}} end of the chord, {{math|1=&quot;x&quot; = {{sfrac|&quot;c&quot;|2}}}} and {{math|1=&quot;y&quot; = &quot;d&quot;}}. Since this point is on the parabola, these coordinates must satisfy the equation above. Therefore, by substitution, formula_278. From this, formula_279.}}

=== Area enclosed between a parabola and a chord ===
The area enclosed between a parabola and a chord (see diagram) is two-thirds of the area of a parallelogram that surrounds it. One side of the parallelogram is the chord, and the opposite side is a tangent to the parabola. The slope of the other parallel sides is irrelevant to the area. Often, as here, they are drawn parallel with the parabola&#x27;s axis of symmetry, but this is arbitrary.

A theorem equivalent to this one, but different in details, was derived by Archimedes in the 3rd century BCE. He used the areas of triangles, rather than that of the parallelogram.{{efn|Archimedes proved that the area of the enclosed parabolic segment was 4/3 as large as that of a triangle that he inscribed within the enclosed segment. It can easily be shown that the parallelogram has twice the area of the triangle, so Archimedes&#x27; proof also proves the theorem with the parallelogram.}} See The Quadrature of the Parabola.

If the chord has length {{mvar|b}} and is perpendicular to the parabola&#x27;s axis of symmetry, and if the perpendicular distance from the parabola&#x27;s vertex to the chord is {{mvar|h}}, the parallelogram is a rectangle, with sides of {{mvar|b}} and {{mvar|h}}. The area {{mvar|A}} of the parabolic segment enclosed by the parabola and the chord is therefore
formula_280

This formula can be compared with the area of a triangle: {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}&quot;bh&quot;}}.

In general, the enclosed area can be calculated as follows. First, locate the point on the parabola where its slope equals that of the chord. This can be done with calculus, or by using a line that is parallel to the axis of symmetry of the parabola and passes through the midpoint of the chord. The required point is where this line intersects the parabola.{{efn|This method can be easily proved correct by calculus. It was also known and used by Archimedes, although he lived nearly 2000 years before calculus was invented.}} Then, using the formula given in Distance from a point to a line, calculate the perpendicular distance from this point to the chord. Multiply this by the length of the chord to get the area of the parallelogram, then by 2/3 to get the required enclosed area.

=== Corollary concerning midpoints and endpoints of chords ===
A corollary of the above discussion is that if a parabola has several parallel chords, their midpoints all lie on a line parallel to the axis of symmetry. If tangents to the parabola are drawn through the endpoints of any of these chords, the two tangents intersect on this same line parallel to the axis of symmetry (see Axis-direction of a parabola).{{efn|A proof of this sentence can be inferred from the proof of the orthoptic property, above. It is shown there that the tangents to the parabola {{math|1=&quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;2}} at {{math|(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;p&quot;2)}} and {{math|(&quot;q&quot;, &quot;q&quot;2)}} intersect at a point whose {{mvar|x}} coordinate is the mean of {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}}. Thus if there is a chord between these two points, the intersection point of the tangents has the same {{mvar|x}} coordinate as the midpoint of the chord.}}

=== Arc length ===
If a point X is located on a parabola with focal length {{mvar|f}}, and if {{mvar|p}} is the perpendicular distance from X to the axis of symmetry of the parabola, then the lengths of arcs of the parabola that terminate at X can be calculated from {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|p}} as follows, assuming they are all expressed in the same units.{{efn|In this calculation, the square root {{mvar|q}} must be positive. The quantity {{math|ln &quot;a&quot;}} is the natural logarithm of {{mvar|a}}.}}
formula_281

This quantity {{mvar|s}} is the length of the arc between X and the vertex of the parabola.

The length of the arc between X and the symmetrically opposite point on the other side of the parabola is {{math|2&quot;s&quot;}}.

The perpendicular distance {{mvar|p}} can be given a positive or negative sign to indicate on which side of the axis of symmetry X is situated. Reversing the sign of {{mvar|p}} reverses the signs of {{mvar|h}} and {{mvar|s}} without changing their absolute values. If these quantities are signed, &quot;the length of the arc between &quot;any&quot; two points on the parabola is always shown by the difference between their values of {{mvar|s}}&quot;. The calculation can be simplified by using the properties of logarithms:
formula_282

This can be useful, for example, in calculating the size of the material needed to make a parabolic reflector or parabolic trough.

This calculation can be used for a parabola in any orientation. It is not restricted to the situation where the axis of symmetry is parallel to the &quot;y&quot; axis.

== A geometrical construction to find a sector area ==
S is the focus, and V is the principal vertex of the parabola VG. Draw VX perpendicular to SV.

Take any point B on VG and drop a perpendicular BQ from B to VX. Draw perpendicular ST intersecting BQ, extended if necessary, at T. At B draw the perpendicular BJ, intersecting VX at J.

For the parabola, the segment VBV, the area enclosed by the chord VB and the arc VB, is equal to ∆VBQ / 3, also formula_283.

The area of the parabolic sector formula_284.

Since triangles TSB and QBJ are similar,
formula_285

Therefore, the area of the parabolic sector formula_286 and can be found from the length of VJ, as found above.

A circle through S, V and B also passes through J.

Conversely, if a point, B on the parabola VG is to be found so that the area of the sector SVB is equal to a specified value, determine the point J on VX and construct a circle through S, V and J. Since SJ is the diameter, the center of the circle is at its midpoint, and it lies on the perpendicular bisector of SV, a distance of one half VJ from SV. The required point B is where this circle intersects the parabola.

If a body traces the path of the parabola due to an inverse square force directed towards S, the area SVB increases at a constant rate as point B moves forward. It follows that J moves at constant speed along VX as B moves along the parabola.

If the speed of the body at the vertex where it is moving perpendicularly to SV is &quot;v&quot;, then the speed of J is equal to {{math|3&quot;v&quot;/4}}.

The construction can be extended simply to include the case where neither radius coincides with the axis SV as follows. Let A be a fixed point on VG between V and B, and point H be the intersection on VX with the perpendicular to SA at A. From the above, the area of the parabolic sector formula_287.

Conversely, if it is required to find the point B for a particular area SAB, find point J from HJ and point B as before. By Book 1, Proposition 16, Corollary 6 of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot;, the speed of a body moving along a parabola with a force directed towards the focus is inversely proportional to the square root of the radius. If the speed at A is &quot;v&quot;, then at the vertex V it is formula_288, and point J moves at a constant speed of formula_289.

The above construction was devised by Isaac Newton and can be found in Book 1 of Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica as Proposition 30.

== Focal length and radius of curvature at the vertex ==
The focal length of a parabola is half of its radius of curvature at its vertex.

;Proof:

Consider a point {{math|(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;)}} on a circle of radius {{mvar|R}} and with center at the point {{math|(0, &quot;R&quot;)}}. The circle passes through the origin. If the point is near the origin, the Pythagorean theorem shows that
formula_290

But if {{math|(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;)}} is extremely close to the origin, since the {{mvar|x}} axis is a tangent to the circle, {{mvar|y}} is very small compared with {{mvar|x}}, so {{math|&quot;y&quot;2}} is negligible compared with the other terms. Therefore, extremely close to the origin
{{NumBlk||formula_291|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Compare this with the parabola
{{NumBlk||formula_292|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
which has its vertex at the origin, opens upward, and has focal length {{mvar|f}} (see preceding sections of this article).

Equations {{EquationNote|(1)}} and {{EquationNote|2|(2)}} are equivalent if {{math|1=&quot;R&quot; = 2&quot;f&quot;}}. Therefore, this is the condition for the circle and parabola to coincide at and extremely close to the origin. The radius of curvature at the origin, which is the vertex of the parabola, is twice the focal length.

; Corollary:
A concave mirror that is a small segment of a sphere behaves approximately like a parabolic mirror, focusing parallel light to a point midway between the centre and the surface of the sphere.

== As the affine image of the unit parabola ==

Another definition of a parabola uses affine transformations:
{{block indent | em = 1.5 | text = Any &quot;parabola&quot; is the affine image of the unit parabola with equation formula_48.}}

=== Parametric representation ===
An affine transformation of the Euclidean plane has the form formula_294, where formula_126 is a regular matrix (determinant is not 0), and formula_296 is an arbitrary vector. If formula_297 are the column vectors of the matrix formula_126, the unit parabola formula_299 is mapped onto the parabola
formula_300
where
* formula_296 is a &quot;point&quot; of the parabola,
* formula_302 is a &quot;tangent vector&quot; at point formula_296,
* formula_304 is &quot;parallel to the axis&quot; of the parabola (axis of symmetry through the vertex).

=== Vertex ===
In general, the two vectors formula_297 are not perpendicular, and formula_296 is &quot;not&quot; the vertex, unless the affine transformation is a similarity.

The tangent vector at the point formula_307 is formula_308. At the vertex the tangent vector is orthogonal to formula_304. Hence the parameter formula_310 of the vertex is the solution of the equation
formula_311
which is
formula_312
and the &quot;vertex&quot; is
formula_313

=== Focal length and focus ===
The &quot;focal length&quot; can be determined by a suitable parameter transformation (which does not change the geometric shape of the parabola). The focal length is
formula_314
Hence the &quot;focus&quot; of the parabola is
formula_315

=== Implicit representation ===
Solving the parametric representation for formula_316 by Cramer&#x27;s rule and using formula_317, one gets the implicit representation
formula_318

=== Parabola in space ===
The definition of a parabola in this section gives a parametric representation of an arbitrary parabola, even in space, if one allows formula_319 to be vectors in space.

== As quadratic Bézier curve ==
A quadratic Bézier curve is a curve formula_320 defined by three points formula_321, formula_322 and formula_323, called its &quot;control points&quot;:
formula_324

This curve is an arc of a parabola (see {{slink||As the affine image of the unit parabola}}).

== Numerical integration ==
In one method of numerical integration one replaces the graph of a function by arcs of parabolas and integrates the parabola arcs. A parabola is determined by three points. The formula for one arc is
formula_325

The method is called Simpson&#x27;s rule.

== As plane section of quadric ==
The following quadrics contain parabolas as plane sections:
* elliptical cone,
* parabolic cylinder,
* elliptical paraboloid,
* hyperbolic paraboloid,
* hyperboloid of one sheet,
* hyperboloid of two sheets.

== As trisectrix ==

A parabola can be used as a trisectrix, that is it allows the exact trisection of an arbitrary angle with straightedge and compass. This is not in contradiction to the impossibility of an angle trisection with compass-and-straightedge constructions alone, as the use of parabolas is not allowed in the classic rules for compass-and-straightedge constructions.

To trisect formula_326, place its leg formula_327 on the &quot;x&quot; axis such that the vertex formula_328 is in the coordinate system&#x27;s origin. The coordinate system also contains the parabola formula_329. The unit circle with radius 1 around the origin intersects the angle&#x27;s other leg formula_330, and from this point of intersection draw the perpendicular onto the &quot;y&quot; axis. The parallel to &quot;y&quot; axis through the midpoint of that perpendicular and the tangent on the unit circle in formula_331 intersect in formula_332. The circle around formula_332 with radius formula_334 intersects the parabola at formula_196. The perpendicular from formula_196 onto the &quot;x&quot; axis intersects the unit circle at formula_199, and formula_338 is exactly one third of formula_326.

The correctness of this construction can be seen by showing that the &quot;x&quot; coordinate of formula_196 is formula_341. Solving the equation system given by the circle around formula_332 and the parabola leads to the cubic equation formula_343. The triple-angle formula formula_344 then shows that formula_341 is indeed a solution of that cubic equation.

This trisection goes back to René Descartes, who described it in his book {{lang|fr|La Géométrie}} (1637).

== Generalizations ==
If one replaces the real numbers by an arbitrary field, many geometric properties of the parabola formula_346 are still valid:
# A line intersects in at most two points. 
# At any point formula_347 the line formula_348 is the tangent.
Essentially new phenomena arise, if the field has characteristic 2 (that is, formula_349): the tangents are all parallel.

In algebraic geometry, the parabola is generalized by the rational normal curves, which have coordinates {{math|(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;2, &quot;x&quot;3, ..., &quot;xn&quot;)}}; the standard parabola is the case {{math|1=&quot;n&quot; = 2}}, and the case {{math|1=&quot;n&quot; = 3}} is known as the twisted cubic. A further generalization is given by the Veronese variety, when there is more than one input variable.

In the theory of quadratic forms, the parabola is the graph of the quadratic form {{math|&quot;x&quot;2}} (or other scalings), while the elliptic paraboloid is the graph of the positive-definite quadratic form {{math|&quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;y&quot;2}} (or scalings), and the hyperbolic paraboloid is the graph of the indefinite quadratic form {{math|&quot;x&quot;2 − &quot;y&quot;2}}. Generalizations to more variables yield further such objects.

The curves {{math|1=&quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;{{isup|&quot;p&quot;}}}} for other values of {{mvar|p}} are traditionally referred to as the higher parabolas and were originally treated implicitly, in the form {{math|1=&quot;x&quot;{{isup|&quot;p&quot;}} = &quot;ky&quot;{{isup|&quot;q&quot;}}}} for {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} both positive integers, in which form they are seen to be algebraic curves. These correspond to the explicit formula {{math|1=&quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;{{isup|&quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot;}}}} for a positive fractional power of {{mvar|x}}. Negative fractional powers correspond to the implicit equation {{math|1=&quot;x&quot;{{isup|&quot;p&quot;}} &quot;y&quot;{{isup|&quot;q&quot;}} = &quot;k&quot;}} and are traditionally referred to as higher hyperbolas. Analytically, {{mvar|x}} can also be raised to an irrational power (for positive values of {{mvar|x}}); the analytic properties are analogous to when {{mvar|x}} is raised to rational powers, but the resulting curve is no longer algebraic and cannot be analyzed by algebraic geometry.

== In the physical world ==
In nature, approximations of parabolas and paraboloids are found in many diverse situations. The best-known instance of the parabola in the history of physics is the trajectory of a particle or body in motion under the influence of a uniform gravitational field without air resistance (for instance, a ball flying through the air, neglecting air friction).

The parabolic trajectory of projectiles was discovered experimentally in the early 17th century by Galileo, who performed experiments with balls rolling on inclined planes. He also later proved this mathematically in his book &quot;Dialogue Concerning Two New Sciences&quot;.{{efn|However, this parabolic shape, as Newton recognized, is only an approximation of the actual elliptical shape of the trajectory and is obtained by assuming that the gravitational force is constant (not pointing toward the center of the Earth) in the area of interest. Often, this difference is negligible and leads to a simpler formula for tracking motion.}} For objects extended in space, such as a diver jumping from a diving board, the object itself follows a complex motion as it rotates, but the center of mass of the object nevertheless moves along a parabola. As in all cases in the physical world, the trajectory is always an approximation of a parabola. The presence of air resistance, for example, always distorts the shape, although at low speeds, the shape is a good approximation of a parabola. At higher speeds, such as in ballistics, the shape is highly distorted and does not resemble a parabola.

Another hypothetical situation in which parabolas might arise, according to the theories of physics described in the 17th and 18th centuries by Sir Isaac Newton, is in two-body orbits, for example, the path of a small planetoid or other object under the influence of the gravitation of the Sun. Parabolic orbits do not occur in nature; simple orbits most commonly resemble hyperbolas or ellipses. The parabolic orbit is the degenerate intermediate case between those two types of ideal orbit. An object following a parabolic orbit would travel at the exact escape velocity of the object it orbits; objects in elliptical or hyperbolic orbits travel at less or greater than escape velocity, respectively. Long-period comets travel close to the Sun&#x27;s escape velocity while they are moving through the inner Solar system, so their paths are nearly parabolic.

Approximations of parabolas are also found in the shape of the main cables on a simple suspension bridge. The curve of the chains of a suspension bridge is always an intermediate curve between a parabola and a catenary, but in practice the curve is generally nearer to a parabola due to the weight of the load (i.e. the road) being much larger than the cables themselves, and in calculations the second-degree polynomial formula of a parabola is used. Under the influence of a uniform load (such as a horizontal suspended deck), the otherwise catenary-shaped cable is deformed toward a parabola (see {{slink|Catenary#Suspension bridge curve}}). Unlike an inelastic chain, a freely hanging spring of zero unstressed length takes the shape of a parabola. Suspension-bridge cables are, ideally, purely in tension, without having to carry other forces, for example, bending. Similarly, the structures of parabolic arches are purely in compression.

Paraboloids arise in several physical situations as well. The best-known instance is the parabolic reflector, which is a mirror or similar reflective device that concentrates light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation to a common focal point, or conversely, collimates light from a point source at the focus into a parallel beam. The principle of the parabolic reflector may have been discovered in the 3rd century BC by the geometer Archimedes, who, according to a dubious legend, constructed parabolic mirrors to defend Syracuse against the Roman fleet, by concentrating the sun&#x27;s rays to set fire to the decks of the Roman ships. The principle was applied to telescopes in the 17th century. Today, paraboloid reflectors can be commonly observed throughout much of the world in microwave and satellite-dish receiving and transmitting antennas.

In parabolic microphones, a parabolic reflector is used to focus sound onto a microphone, giving it highly directional performance.

Paraboloids are also observed in the surface of a liquid confined to a container and rotated around the central axis. In this case, the centrifugal force causes the liquid to climb the walls of the container, forming a parabolic surface. This is the principle behind the liquid-mirror telescope.

Aircraft used to create a weightless state for purposes of experimentation, such as NASA&#x27;s &quot;Vomit Comet&quot;, follow a vertically parabolic trajectory for brief periods in order to trace the course of an object in free fall, which produces the same effect as zero gravity for most purposes.

<doc id="23233" wikidata="Q7246962" url="?curid=23233" title="Problem of the criterion">
<text>In the field of epistemology, the problem of the criterion is an issue regarding the starting point of knowledge. This is a separate and more fundamental issue than the regress argument found in discussions on justification of knowledge. 

In Western philosophy the earliest surviving documentation of the problem of the criterion is in the works of the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus. In &quot;Outlines of Pyrrhonism&quot; Sextus Empiricus demonstrated that no criterion of truth had been established, contrary to the position of dogmatists such as the Stoics and their doctrine of &quot;katalepsis&quot;. In this Sextus was repeating or building upon earlier Pyrrhonist arguments about the problem of the criterion, as Pyrrho, the founder of Pyrrhonism, had declared that &quot;neither our sense-perceptions nor our &quot;doxai&quot; (views, theories, beliefs) tell us the truth or lie.

American philosopher Roderick Chisholm in his &quot;Theory of Knowledge&quot; details the problem of the criterion with two sets of questions:

# What do we know? or What is the extent of our knowledge?
# How do we know? or What is the criterion for deciding whether we have knowledge in any particular case?

An answer to either set of questions will allow us to devise a means of answering the other. Answering the former question set first is called &quot;particularism&quot;, whereas answering the latter set first is called &quot;methodism&quot;. A third solution is &quot;skepticism&quot;, which proclaims that since one cannot have an answer to the first set of questions without first answering the second set, and one cannot hope to answer the second set of questions without first knowing the answers to the first set, we are, therefore, unable to answer either. This has the result of us being unable to justify any of our beliefs.

Particularist theories organize things already known and attempt to use these particulars of knowledge to find a method of how we know, thus answering the second question set. Methodist theories propose an answer to question set two and proceed to use this to establish what we, in fact, know. Classical empiricism embraces the methodist approach.

<text>The Paleozoic ( , , ; or Palaeozoic) Era is the first of three geological eras of the Phanerozoic Eon. Beginning 538.8 million years ago (Ma), it succeeds the Neoproterozoic (the last era of the Proterozoic Eon) and ends 251.9 Ma at the start of the Mesozoic Era. The Paleozoic is subdivided into six geologic periods (from oldest to youngest), Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian. Some geological timescales divide the Paleozoic informally into early and late sub-eras: the Early Paleozoic consisting of the Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian; the Late Paleozoic consisting of the Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian.

The name &quot;Paleozoic&quot; was first used by Adam Sedgwick (1785–1873) in 1838 to describe the Cambrian and Ordovician periods. It was redefined by John Phillips (1800–1874) in 1840 to cover the Cambrian to Permian periods. It is derived from the Greek &quot;palaiós&quot; (παλαιός, &quot;old&quot;) and &quot;zōḗ&quot; (ζωή, &quot;life&quot;) meaning &quot;ancient life&quot;.

The Paleozoic was a time of dramatic geological, climatic, and evolutionary change. The Cambrian witnessed the most rapid and widespread diversification of life in Earth&#x27;s history, known as the Cambrian explosion, in which most modern phyla first appeared. Arthropods, molluscs, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and synapsids all evolved during the Paleozoic. Life began in the ocean but eventually transitioned onto land, and by the late Paleozoic, great forests of primitive plants covered the continents, many of which formed the coal beds of Europe and eastern North America. Towards the end of the era, large, sophisticated synapsids and diapsids were dominant and the first modern plants (conifers) appeared.

The Paleozoic Era ended with the largest extinction event of the Phanerozoic Eon, the Permian–Triassic extinction event. The effects of this catastrophe were so devastating that it took life on land 30 million years into the Mesozoic Era to recover.
Recovery of life in the sea may have been much faster.

== Boundaries ==
The base of the Paleozoic is one of the major divisions in geological time representing the divide between the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic eons, the Paleozoic and Neoproterozoic eras and the Ediacaran and Cambrian periods. When Adam Sedgwick named the Paleozoic in 1835, he defined the base as the first appearance of complex life in the rock record as shown by the presence of trilobite-dominated fauna. Since then evidence of complex life in older rock sequences has increased and by the second half of the 20th century, the first appearance of small shelly fauna (SSF), also known as early skeletal fossils, were considered markers for the base of the Paleozoic. However, whilst SSF are well preserved in carbonate sediments, the majority of Ediacaran to Cambrian rock sequences are composed of siliciclastic rocks where skeletal fossils are rarely preserved. This led the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) to use trace fossils as an indicator of complex life. Unlike later in the fossil record, Cambrian trace fossils are preserved in a wide range of sediments and environments, which aids correlation between different sites around the world. Trace fossils reflect the complexity of the body plan of the organism that made them. Ediacaran trace fossils are simple, sub-horizontal feeding traces. As more complex organisms evolved, their more complex behaviour was reflected in greater diversity and complexity of the trace fossils they left behind. After two decades of deliberation, the ICS chose Fortune Head, Burin Peninsula, Newfoundland as the basal Cambrian Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) at the base of the &quot;Treptichnus pedum&quot; assemblage of trace fossils and immediately above the last occurrence of the Ediacaran problematica fossils &quot;Harlaniella podolica&quot; and &quot;Palaeopsacichnus&quot;. The base of the Phanerozoic, Paleozoic and Cambrian is dated at 538.8+/-0.2 Ma and now lies below both the first appearance of trilobites and SSF.

The boundary between the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras and the Permian and Triassic periods is marked by the first occurrence of the conodont &quot;Hindeodus parvus&quot;. This is the first biostratigraphic event found worldwide that is associated with the beginning of the recovery following the end-Permian mass extinctions and environmental changes. In non-marine strata, the equivalent level is marked by the disappearance of the Permian Dicynodon tetrapods. This means events previously considered to mark the Permian-Triassic boundary, such as the eruption of the Siberian Traps flood basalts, the onset of greenhouse climate, ocean anoxia and acidification and the resulting mass extinction are now regarded as being of latest Permian in age. The GSSP is near Meishan, Zhejiang Province, southern China. Radiometric dating of volcanic clay layers just above and below the boundary confine its age to a narrow range of 251.902+/-0.024 Ma.

==Geology==
The beginning of the Paleozoic Era witnessed the breakup of the supercontinent of Pannotia
and ended while the supercontinent Pangaea was assembling.
The breakup of Pannotia began with the opening of the Iapetus Ocean and other Cambrian seas and coincided with a dramatic rise in sea level.
Paleoclimatic studies and evidence of glaciers indicate that Central Africa was most likely in the polar regions during the early Paleozoic. The breakup of Pannotia was followed by the assembly of the huge continent Gondwana (). By the mid-Paleozoic, the collision of North America and Europe produced the Acadian-Caledonian uplifts, and a subducting plate uplifted eastern Australia. By the late Paleozoic, continental collisions formed the supercontinent of Pangaea and created great mountain chains, including the Appalachians, Caledonides, Ural Mountains, and mountains of Tasmania.

=== Cambrian Period ===
The Cambrian spanned from 539–485 million years ago and is the first period of the Paleozoic Era of the Phanerozoic. The Cambrian marked a boom in evolution in an event known as the Cambrian explosion in which the largest number of creatures evolved in any single period of the history of the Earth. Creatures like algae evolved, but the most ubiquitous of that period were the armored arthropods, like trilobites. Almost all marine phyla evolved in this period. During this time, the supercontinent Pannotia begins to break up, most of which later became the supercontinent Gondwana.
=== Ordovician Period ===

The Ordovician spanned from 485–444 million years ago. The Ordovician was a time in Earth&#x27;s history in which many of the biological classes still prevalent today evolved, such as primitive fish, cephalopods, and coral. The most common forms of life, however, were trilobites, snails and shellfish. The first arthropods went ashore to colonize the empty continent of Gondwana. By the end of the Ordovician, Gondwana was at the south pole, early North America had collided with Europe, closing the intervening ocean. Glaciation of Africa resulted in a major drop in sea level, killing off all life that had established along coastal Gondwana. Glaciation may have caused the Ordovician–Silurian extinction events, in which 60% of marine invertebrates and 25% of families became extinct, and is considered the first Phanerozoic mass extinction event, and the second deadliest.

=== Silurian Period ===
The Silurian spanned from 444–419 million years ago. The Silurian saw the rejuvenation of life as the Earth recovered from the previous glaciation. This period saw the mass evolution of fish, as jawless fish became more numerous, jawed fish evolved, and the first freshwater fish evolved, though arthropods, such as sea scorpions, were still apex predators. Fully terrestrial life evolved, including early arachnids, fungi, and centipedes. The evolution of vascular plants (&quot;Cooksonia&quot;) allowed plants to gain a foothold on land. These early plants were the forerunners of all plant life on land. During this time, there were four continents: Gondwana (Africa, South America, Australia, Antarctica, Siberia), Laurentia (North America), Baltica (Northern Europe), and Avalonia (Western Europe). The recent rise in sea levels allowed many new species to thrive in water.

=== Devonian Period ===

The Devonian spanned from 419–359 million years ago. Also known as &quot;The Age of the Fish&quot;, the Devonian featured a huge diversification of fish, including armored fish like &quot;Dunkleosteus&quot; and lobe-finned fish which eventually evolved into the first tetrapods. On land, plant groups diversified rapidly in an event known as the Devonian explosion when plants made lignin, leading to taller growth and vascular tissue; the first trees and seeds evolved. These new habitats led to greater arthropod diversification. The first amphibians appeared and fish occupied the top of the food chain. Earth&#x27;s second Phanerozoic mass extinction event (a group of several smaller extinction events), the Late Devonian extinction, ended 70% of existing species.

=== Carboniferous Period ===
The Carboniferous is named after the large coal deposits laid down during the period. It spanned from 359–299 million years ago. During this time, average global temperatures were exceedingly high; the early Carboniferous averaged at about 20 degrees Celsius (but cooled to 10 °C during the Middle Carboniferous). An important evolutionary development of the time was the evolution of amniotic eggs, which allowed amphibians to move farther inland and remain the dominant vertebrates for the duration of this period. Also, the first reptiles and synapsids evolved in the swamps. Throughout the Carboniferous, there was a cooling trend, which led to the Permo-Carboniferous glaciation or the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse. Gondwana was glaciated as much of it was situated around the south pole.

=== Permian Period ===
The Permian spanned from 299–252 million years ago and was the last period of the Paleozoic Era. At the beginning of this period, all continents joined together to form the supercontinent Pangaea, which was encircled by one ocean called Panthalassa. The land mass was very dry during this time, with harsh seasons, as the climate of the interior of Pangaea was not regulated by large bodies of water. Diapsids and synapsids flourished in the new dry climate. Creatures such as &quot;Dimetrodon&quot; and &quot;Edaphosaurus&quot; ruled the new continent. The first conifers evolved, and dominated the terrestrial landscape. Near the end of the Permian, however, Pangaea grew drier. The interior was desert, and new taxa such as &quot;Scutosaurus&quot; and Gorgonopsids filled it. Eventually they disappeared, along with 95% of all life on Earth, in a cataclysm known as &quot;The Great Dying&quot;, the third and most severe Phanerozoic mass extinction.

==Climate==
The early Cambrian climate was probably moderate at first, becoming warmer over the course of the Cambrian, as the second-greatest sustained sea level rise in the Phanerozoic got underway. However, as if to offset this trend, Gondwana moved south, so that, in Ordovician time, most of West Gondwana (Africa and South America) lay directly over the South Pole.

The early Paleozoic climate was strongly zonal, with the result that the &quot;climate&quot;, in an abstract sense, became warmer, but the living space of most organisms of the time – the continental shelf marine environment – became steadily colder. However, Baltica (Northern Europe and Russia) and Laurentia (eastern North America and Greenland) remained in the tropical zone, while China and Australia lay in waters which were at least temperate. The early Paleozoic ended, rather abruptly, with the short, but apparently severe, late Ordovician ice age. This cold spell caused the second-greatest mass extinction of the Phanerozoic Eon. Over time, the warmer weather moved into the Paleozoic Era.

The Ordovician and Silurian were warm greenhouse periods, with the highest sea levels of the Paleozoic (200 m above today&#x27;s); the warm climate was interrupted only by a cool period, the Early Palaeozoic Icehouse, culminating in the Hirnantian glaciation, at the end of the Ordovician.

The middle Paleozoic was a time of considerable stability. Sea levels had dropped coincident with the ice age, but slowly recovered over the course of the Silurian and Devonian. The slow merger of Baltica and Laurentia, and the northward movement of bits and pieces of Gondwana created numerous new regions of relatively warm, shallow sea floor. As plants took hold on the continental margins, oxygen levels increased and carbon dioxide dropped, although much less dramatically. The north–south temperature gradient also seems to have moderated, or metazoan life simply became hardier, or both. At any event, the far southern continental margins of Antarctica and West Gondwana became increasingly less barren. The Devonian ended with a series of turnover pulses which killed off much of middle Paleozoic vertebrate life, without noticeably reducing species diversity overall.

There are many unanswered questions about the late Paleozoic. The Mississippian (early Carboniferous Period) began with a spike in atmospheric oxygen, while carbon dioxide plummeted to new lows. This destabilized the climate and led to one, and perhaps two, ice ages during the Carboniferous. These were far more severe than the brief Late Ordovician ice age; but, this time, the effects on world biota were inconsequential. By the Cisuralian Epoch, both oxygen and carbon dioxide had recovered to more normal levels. On the other hand, the assembly of Pangaea created huge arid inland areas subject to temperature extremes. The Lopingian Epoch is associated with falling sea levels, increased carbon dioxide and general climatic deterioration, culminating in the devastation of the Permian extinction.

==Flora==

While macroscopic plant life appeared early in the Paleozoic Era and possibly late in the Neoproterozoic Era of the earlier eon, plants mostly remained aquatic until the Silurian Period, about 420 million years ago, when they began to transition onto dry land. Terrestrial flora reached its climax in the Carboniferous, when towering lycopsid rainforests dominated the tropical belt of Euramerica. Climate change caused the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse which fragmented this habitat, diminishing the diversity of plant life in the late Carboniferous and Permian periods.

==Fauna==
A noteworthy feature of Paleozoic life is the sudden appearance of nearly all of the invertebrate animal phyla in great abundance at the beginning of the Cambrian. The first vertebrates appeared in the form of primitive fish, which greatly diversified in the Silurian and Devonian Periods. The first animals to venture onto dry land were the arthropods. Some fish had lungs, and powerful bony fins that in the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago, allowed them to crawl onto land. The bones in their fins eventually evolved into legs and they became the first tetrapods, , and began to develop lungs. Amphibians were the dominant tetrapods until the mid-Carboniferous, when climate change greatly reduced their diversity, allowing amniotes to take over. Amniotes would split into two clades shortly after their origin in the Carboniferous; the synapsids, which was the dominant group, and the sauropsids. The synapsids continued to prosper and increase in number and variety till the end of the Permian period. In late middle Permian the pareiasaurs originated, successful herbivores and the only sauropsids that could reach sizes comparable to some of the largest synapsids.

The Palaeozoic marine fauna was notably lacking in predators relative to the present day. Predators made up about 4% of the fauna in Palaeozoic assemblages while making up 17% of temperate Cenozoic assemblages and 31% of tropical ones. Infaunal animals made up 4% of soft substrate Palaeozoic communities but about 47% of Cenozoic communities. Additionally, the Palaeozoic had very few facultatively motile animals that could easily adjust to disturbance, with such creatures composing 1% of its assemblages in contrast to 50% in Cenozoic faunal assemblages. Non-motile animals untethered to the substrate, extremely rare in the Cenozoic, were abundant in the Palaeozoic.

==Microbiota==
Palaeozoic phytoplankton overall were both nutrient-poor themselves and adapted to nutrient-poor environmental conditions. This phytoplankton nutrient poverty has been cited as an explanation for the Palaeozoic&#x27;s relatively low biodiversity.

<text>Pakistan, officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a country in South Asia. It is the fifth-most populous country, with a population of over 241.5 million, having the second-largest Muslim population as of 2023. Islamabad is the nation&#x27;s capital, while Karachi is its largest city and financial centre. Pakistan is the 33rd-largest country by area. Bounded by the Arabian Sea on the south, the Gulf of Oman on the southwest, and the Sir Creek on the southeast, it shares land borders with India to the east; Afghanistan to the west; Iran to the southwest; and China to the northeast. It shares a maritime border with Oman in the Gulf of Oman, and is separated from Tajikistan in the northwest by Afghanistan&#x27;s narrow Wakhan Corridor.

Pakistan is the site of several ancient cultures, including the 8,500-year-old Neolithic site of Mehrgarh in Balochistan, the Indus Valley Civilisation of the Bronze Age, and the ancient Gandhara civilisation. The regions that compose the modern state of Pakistan were the realm of multiple empires and dynasties, including the Achaemenid, the Maurya, the Kushan, the Gupta; the Umayyad Caliphate in its southern regions, the Hindu Shahis, the Ghaznavids, the Delhi Sultanate, the Samma, the Shah Miris, the Mughals, and most recently, the British Raj from 1858 to 1947.

Spurred by the Pakistan Movement, which sought a homeland for the Muslims of British India, and election victories in 1946 by the All-India Muslim League, Pakistan gained independence in 1947 after the Partition of the British Indian Empire, which awarded separate statehood to its Muslim-majority regions and was accompanied by an unparalleled mass migration and loss of life. Initially a Dominion of the British Commonwealth, Pakistan officially drafted its constitution in 1956, and emerged as a declared Islamic republic. In 1971, the exclave of East Pakistan seceded as the new country of Bangladesh after a nine-month-long civil war. In the following four decades, Pakistan has been ruled by governments that alternated between civilian and military, democratic and authoritarian, relatively secular and Islamist.

Pakistan is considered a middle power nation, with the world&#x27;s sixth-largest standing armed forces. It is a declared nuclear-weapons state, and is ranked amongst the emerging and growth-leading economies, with a large and rapidly growing middle class. Pakistan&#x27;s political history since independence has been characterized by periods of significant economic and military growth as well as those of political and economic instability. It is an ethnically and linguistically diverse country, with similarly diverse geography and wildlife. The country continues to face challenges, including poverty, illiteracy, corruption, and terrorism. Pakistan is a member of the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Commonwealth of Nations, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, and the Islamic Military Counter-Terrorism Coalition, and is designated as a major non-NATO ally by the United States.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Pakistan&quot; was coined by Choudhry Rahmat Ali, a Pakistan Movement activist, who in January 1933 first published it (originally as &quot;Pakstan&quot;) in a pamphlet &quot;Now or Never&quot;, using it as an acronym. Rahmat Ali explained: &quot;It is composed of letters taken from the names of all our homelands, Indian and Asian, &quot;P&quot;anjab, &quot;A&quot;fghania, &quot;K&quot;ashmir, &quot;S&quot;indh, and Baluchis&quot;tan&quot;.&quot; He added, &quot;Pakistan is both a Persian and Urdu word... It means the land of the Paks, the spiritually pure and clean.&quot; Etymologists note that , is &#x27;pure&#x27; in Persian and Pashto and the Persian suffix means &#x27;land&#x27; or &#x27;place of&#x27;.

Rahmat Ali&#x27;s concept of Pakistan only related to the northwestern area of the Indian subcontinent. He also proposed the name &quot;Banglastan&quot; for the Muslim areas of Bengal and &quot;Osmanistan&quot; for Hyderabad State, as well as a political federation between the three.

== History ==

=== Indus Valley civilisation ===

Some of the earliest ancient human civilisations in South Asia originated from areas encompassing present-day Pakistan. The earliest known inhabitants in the region were Soanian during the Lower Paleolithic, of whom artefacts have been found in the Soan Valley of Punjab. The Indus region, which covers most of the present-day Pakistan, was the site of several successive ancient cultures including the Neolithic (7000–4300 BCE) site of Mehrgarh, and the 5,000-year history of urban life in South Asia to the various sites of the Indus Valley Civilisation, including Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.

===Vedic period===

Following the decline of the Indus valley civilization, Indo-Aryan tribes moved into the Punjab from Central Asia in several waves of migration in the Vedic period (1500–500 BCE), bringing with them their distinctive religious traditions and practices which fused with local culture. The Indo-Aryans religious beliefs and practices from the Bactria–Margiana culture and the native Harappan Indus beliefs of the former Indus Valley civilization eventually gave rise to Vedic culture and tribes. Most notable among them was Gandhara civilization, which flourished at the crossroads of India, Central Asia, and the Middle East, connecting trade routes and absorbing cultural influences from diverse civilizations. The initial early Vedic culture was a tribal, pastoral society centered in the Indus Valley, of what is today Pakistan. During this period, the Vedas, the oldest scriptures of Hinduism, were composed.

===Classical period===

The western regions of Pakistan became part of Achaemenid Empire around 517 BCE. In 326 BCE, Alexander the Great conquered the region by defeating various local rulers, most notably, the King Porus, at Jhelum. It was followed by the Maurya Empire, founded by Chandragupta Maurya and extended by Ashoka the Great, until 185 BCE. The Indo-Greek Kingdom founded by Demetrius of Bactria (180–165 BCE) included Gandhara and Punjab and reached its greatest extent under Menander (165–150 BCE), prospering the Greco-Buddhist culture in the region. Taxila had one of the earliest universities and centres of higher education in the world, which was established during the late Vedic period in the 6th century BCE. The ancient university was documented by the invading forces of Alexander the Great and was also recorded by Chinese pilgrims in the 4th or 5th century CE. At its zenith, the Rai dynasty (489–632 CE) ruled Sindh and the surrounding territories.

===Islamic conquest===
The Arab conqueror Muhammad ibn Qasim conquered Sindh and some regions of Punjab in 711 CE. The Pakistan government&#x27;s official chronology claims this as the time when the foundation of Pakistan was laid. The early medieval period (642–1219 CE) witnessed the spread of Islam in the region. Before the arrival of Islam beginning in the 8th century, the region of Pakistan was home to a diverse plethora of faiths, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Zoroastrianism. During this period, Sufi missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional population to Islam. Upon the defeat of the Turk and Hindu Shahi dynasties which governed the Kabul Valley, Gandhara (present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), and western Punjab in the 7th to 11th centuries CE, several successive Muslim empires ruled over the region, including the Ghaznavid Empire (975–1187 CE), the Ghorid Kingdom, and the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526 CE). The Lodi dynasty, the last of the Delhi Sultanate, was replaced by the Mughal Empire (1526–1857 CE).
The Mughals introduced Persian literature and high culture, establishing the roots of Indo-Persian culture in the region. In the region of modern-day Pakistan, key cities during the Mughal period were Multan, Lahore, Peshawar and Thatta, which were chosen as the site of impressive Mughal buildings. In the early 16th century, the region remained under the Mughal Empire. In the 18th century, the slow disintegration of the Mughal Empire was hastened by the emergence of the rival powers of the Maratha Confederacy and later the Sikh Empire, as well as invasions by Nader Shah from Iran in 1739 and the Durrani Empire of Afghanistan in 1759. The growing political power of the British in Bengal had not yet reached the territories of modern Pakistan.

=== Colonial rule ===
None of modern Pakistan was under British rule until 1839 when Karachi, a small fishing village governed by Talpurs of Sindh with a mud fort guarding the harbour, was taken, and used as an enclave with a port and military base for the First Afghan War that ensued. The remainder of Sindh was acquired in 1843, and subsequently, through a series of wars and treaties, the East India Company, and later, after the post-Sepoy Mutiny (1857–1858), direct rule by Queen Victoria of the British Empire, acquired most of the region. Key conflicts included those against the Baloch Talpur dynasty, resolved by the Battle of Miani (1843) in Sindh, the Anglo-Sikh Wars (1845–1849), and the Anglo-Afghan Wars (1839–1919). By 1893, all modern Pakistan was part of the British Indian Empire, and remained so until independence in 1947.

Under British rule, modern Pakistan was primarily divided into the Sind Division, Punjab Province, and the Baluchistan Agency. The region also included various princely states, with the largest being Bahawalpur.

The major armed struggle against the British in the region was the rebellion known as the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857. Divergence in the relationship between Hinduism and Islam resulted in significant tension in British India, leading to religious violence. The language controversy further exacerbated tensions between Hindus and Muslims. A Muslim intellectual movement, led by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan to counter the Hindu renaissance, advocated for the two-nation theory and led to the establishment of the All-India Muslim League in 1906.

In March 1929, in response to the Nehru Report, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, issued his fourteen points, which included proposals to safeguard the interests of the Muslim minority in a united India. These proposals were rejected. In his 29 December 1930 address, Allama Iqbal advocated the amalgamation of Muslim-majority states in North-West India, including Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, Sind, and Baluchistan. The perception that Congress-led British provincial governments neglected the Muslim League from 1937 to 1939 motivated Jinnah and other Muslim League leaders to embrace the two-nation theory. This led to the adoption of the Lahore Resolution of 1940, presented by Sher-e-Bangla A.K. Fazlul Haque, also known as the Pakistan Resolution.

By 1942, Britain faced considerable strain during World War II, with India directly threatened by Japanese forces. Britain had pledged voluntary independence for India in exchange for support during the war. However, this pledge included a clause stating that no part of British India would be compelled to join the resulting dominion, which could be interpreted as support for an independent Muslim nation. Congress under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement, demanding an immediate end to British rule. In contrast, the Muslim League chose to support the UK&#x27;s war efforts, thereby nurturing the possibility of establishing a Muslim nation.

=== Independence ===


The 1946 elections saw the Muslim League secure 90 percent of the Muslim seats, supported by the landowners of Sindh and Punjab. This forced the Indian National Congress, initially skeptical of the League&#x27;s representation of Indian Muslims, to acknowledge its significance. Jinnah&#x27;s emergence as the voice of the Indian Muslims, compelled the British to consider their stance, despite their reluctance to partition India. In a final attempt to prevent partition, they proposed the Cabinet Mission Plan.

As the Cabinet Mission failed, the British announced their intention to end rule by June 1948. Following rigorous discussions involving Viceroy of India, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, Muhammad Ali Jinnah of the All-India Muslim League, and Jawaharlal Nehru of Congress, the formal declaration to partition British India into two independent dominions—namely Pakistan and India—was issued by Mountbatten on the evening of 3 June 1947. In Mountbatten&#x27;s oval office, the prime ministers of around a dozen major princely states gathered to receive their copies of the plan before its worldwide broadcast. At 7:00 P.M., All India Radio transmitted the public announcement, starting with the viceroy&#x27;s address, followed by individual speeches from Nehru, and Jinnah. The founder of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah concluded his address with the slogan &quot;Pakistan Zindabad&quot; (Long Live Pakistan).

As the United Kingdom agreed to the partitioning of India, the modern state of Pakistan was established on 14 August 1947 . This new nation amalgamated the Muslim-majority eastern and northwestern regions of British India, comprising the provinces of Balochistan, East Bengal, the North-West Frontier Province, West Punjab, and Sindh.

In the riots that accompanied the partition in Punjab Province, between 200,000 and 2,000,000 people were killed in what some have described as a retributive genocide between the religions. Around 50,000 Muslim women were abducted and raped by Hindu and Sikh men, while 33,000 Hindu and Sikh women experienced the same fate at the hands of Muslims. Around 6.5 million Muslims moved from India to West Pakistan and 4.7 million Hindus and Sikhs moved from West Pakistan to India. It was the largest mass migration in human history. A subsequent dispute over the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir eventually sparked the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948.

=== Post Independence ===

After independence in 1947, Jinnah, the President of the Muslim League, became Pakistan&#x27;s first Governor-General and the first President-Speaker of the Parliament, but he succumbed to tuberculosis on 11 September 1948. Meanwhile, Pakistan&#x27;s founding fathers agreed to appoint Liaquat Ali Khan, the secretary-general of the party, the nation&#x27;s first Prime Minister. From 1947 to 1956, Pakistan was a monarchy within the Commonwealth of Nations, and had two monarchs before it became a republic.

The creation of Pakistan was never fully accepted by many British leaders including Lord Mountbatten. Mountbatten expressed his lack of support and faith in the Muslim League&#x27;s idea of Pakistan. Jinnah refused Mountbatten&#x27;s offer to serve as Governor-General of Pakistan. When Mountbatten was asked by Collins and Lapierre if he would have sabotaged Pakistan had he known that Jinnah was dying of tuberculosis, he replied &#x27;most probably&#x27;.

Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, a respected Deobandi &quot;alim&quot; (scholar) who held the position of Shaykh al-Islam in Pakistan in 1949, and Maulana Mawdudi of Jamaat-i-Islami played key roles in advocating for an Islamic constitution. Mawdudi insisted that the Constituent Assembly declare the &quot;supreme sovereignty of God&quot; and the supremacy of the &quot;shariah&quot; in Pakistan.

The efforts of Jamaat-i-Islami and the &quot;ulama&quot; led to the passage of the Objectives Resolution in March 1949. This resolution, described by Liaquat Ali Khan as the second most significant step in Pakistan&#x27;s history, affirmed that &quot;sovereignty over the entire universe belongs to God Almighty alone and the authority which He has delegated to the State of Pakistan through its people for being exercised within the limits prescribed by Him is a sacred trust&quot;. It was later included as a preamble to the constitutions of 1956, 1962, and 1973.

Democracy faced setbacks due to the martial law imposed by President Iskander Mirza, who was succeeded by General Ayub Khan. After adopting a presidential system in 1962, Pakistan witnessed significant growth until the second war with India in 1965, resulting in an economic downturn and widespread public discontent in 1967. In 1969, President Yahya Khan consolidated control, but faced a devastating cyclone in East Pakistan resulting in 500,000 deaths.

In 1970, Pakistan conducted its first democratic elections since independence, intending to transition from military rule to democracy. However, after the East Pakistani Awami League emerged victorious over the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Yahya Khan and the military refused to transfer power. This led to Operation Searchlight, a military crackdown, and eventually sparked the war of liberation by Bengali Mukti Bahini forces in East Pakistan, described in West Pakistan as a civil war rather than a liberation struggle.

Independent researchers estimate that between 300,000 and 500,000 civilians died during this period while the Bangladesh government puts the number of dead at three million, a figure that is now nearly universally regarded as excessively inflated. Some academics such as Rudolph Rummel and Rounaq Jahan say both sides committed genocide; others such as Richard Sisson and Leo E. Rose believe there was no genocide. In response to India&#x27;s support for the insurgency in East Pakistan, preemptive strikes on India by Pakistan&#x27;s air force, navy, and marines sparked a conventional war in 1971 that resulted in an Indian victory and East Pakistan gaining independence as Bangladesh.

With Pakistan surrendering in the war, Yahya Khan was replaced by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as president; the country worked towards promulgating its constitution and putting the country on the road to democracy. In 1972 Pakistan embarked on an ambitious plan to develop its nuclear deterrence capability with the goal of preventing any foreign invasion; the country&#x27;s first nuclear power plant was inaugurated in that same year. India&#x27;s first nuclear test in 1974 gave Pakistan additional justification to accelerate its nuclear program.

Democracy ended with a military coup in 1977 against the leftist PPP, which saw General Zia-ul-Haq become the president in 1978. From 1977 to 1988, President Zia&#x27;s corporatisation and economic Islamisation initiatives led to Pakistan becoming one of the fastest-growing economies in South Asia. While building up the country&#x27;s nuclear program, increasing Islamisation, and the rise of a homegrown conservative philosophy, Pakistan helped subsidise and distribute US resources to factions of the mujahideen against the USSR&#x27;s intervention in communist Afghanistan. Pakistan&#x27;s North-West Frontier Province became a base for the anti-Soviet Afghan fighters, with the province&#x27;s influential Deobandi ulama playing a significant role in encouraging and organising the &#x27;jihad&#x27;.

President Zia died in a plane crash in 1988, and Benazir Bhutto, daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was elected as the country&#x27;s first female Prime Minister. The PPP was followed by conservative Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML (N)), and over the next decade the leaders of the two parties fought for power, alternating in office. This period is marked by prolonged stagflation, political instability, corruption, misgovernment, geopolitical rivalry with India, and the clash of left wing-right wing ideologies. As PML (N) secured a supermajority in elections in 1997, Nawaz Sharif authorised nuclear testings, as a retaliation to the second nuclear tests conducted by India in May 1998.

Military tension between the two countries in the Kargil district led to the Kargil War of 1999, and turmoil in civil-military relations allowed General Pervez Musharraf to take over through a bloodless coup d&#x27;état. Musharraf governed Pakistan as chief executive from 1999 to 2002 and as president from 2001 to 2008—a period of enlightenment, social liberalism, extensive economic reforms, and direct involvement in the US-led war on terrorism. By its own financial calculations, Pakistan&#x27;s involvement in the war on terrorism has cost up to $118 billion, over eighty one thousand casualties, and more than 1.8 million displaced civilians.

The National Assembly historically completed its first full five-year term on 15 November 2007. After the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in 2007, the PPP secured the most votes in the elections of 2008, appointing party member Yusuf Raza Gilani as Prime Minister. Threatened with impeachment, President Musharraf resigned on 18 August 2008, and was succeeded by Asif Ali Zardari. Clashes with the judicature prompted Gilani&#x27;s disqualification from the Parliament and as the Prime Minister in June 2012. The general election held in 2013 saw the PML (N) achieve victory, following which Nawaz Sharif was elected as Prime Minister for the third time. In 2018, PTI won the general election and Imran Khan became the 22nd Prime Minister. In April 2022, Shehbaz Sharif was elected as prime minister, after Imran Khan lost a no-confidence vote. During 2024 general election, PTI-backed independents became the largest bloc, but Shehbaz Sharif was elected prime minister for a second term, as a result of a coalition between PML (N) and PPPP.
== Geography ==

Pakistan&#x27;s diverse geography and climate host a wide array of wildlife. Covering , Pakistan&#x27;s size is comparable to France and the UK combined. It ranks as the 33rd-largest nation by total area, but this varies based on Kashmir&#x27;s disputed status. Pakistan boasts a coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman, and shares land borders totaling , including with Afghanistan, with China, with India, and with Iran. It has a maritime border with Oman, and shares a border with Tajikistan via the Wakhan Corridor. Situated at the crossroads of South Asia, the Middle East, and Central Asia, Pakistan&#x27;s location is geopolitically significant. Geologically, Pakistan straddles the Indus–Tsangpo Suture Zone and the Indian tectonic plate in Sindh and Punjab, while Balochistan and most of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa sit on the Eurasian Plate, primarily on the Iranian plateau. Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir, along the Indian plate&#x27;s edge, are susceptible to powerful earthquakes.

Pakistan&#x27;s landscapes vary from coastal plains to glaciated mountains, offering deserts, forests, hills, and plateaus. Pakistan is divided into three major geographic areas: the northern highlands, the Indus River plain, and the Balochistan Plateau. The northern highlands feature the Karakoram, Hindu Kush, and Pamir mountain ranges, hosting some of the world&#x27;s highest peaks, including five of the fourteen eight-thousanders (mountain peaks over ), notably K2 () and Nanga Parbat (). The Balochistan Plateau lies in the west and the Thar Desert in the east. The Indus River and its tributaries traverse the nation from Kashmir to the Arabian Sea, sustaining alluvial plains along the Punjab and Sindh regions.

The climate varies from tropical to temperate, with arid conditions in the coastal south. There is a monsoon season with frequent flooding due to heavy rainfall, and a dry season with significantly less rainfall or none at all. Pakistan experiences four distinct seasons: a cool, dry winter from December through February; a hot, dry spring from March through May; the summer rainy season, or southwest monsoon period, from June through September; and the retreating monsoon period of October and November. Rainfall varies greatly from year to year, with patterns of alternate flooding and drought common.

=== Flora and fauna ===

The diverse landscape and climate in Pakistan support a wide range of trees and plants. From coniferous alpine and subalpine trees like spruce, pine, and deodar cedar in the northern mountains to deciduous trees like shisham in the Sulaiman Mountains, and palms such as coconut and date in the southern regions. The western hills boast juniper, tamarisk, coarse grasses, and scrub plants. Mangrove forests dominate the coastal wetlands in the south. Coniferous forests span altitudes from in most northern and northwestern highlands. In Balochistan&#x27;s xeric regions, date palms and &quot;Ephedra&quot; are prevalent. In Punjab and Sindh&#x27;s Indus plains, tropical and subtropical dry and moist broadleaf forests as well as tropical and xeric shrublands thrive. Approximately 4.8% or of Pakistan was forested in 2021.

Pakistan&#x27;s fauna mirrors its diverse climate. The country boasts around 668 bird species, including crows, sparrows, mynas, hawks, falcons, and eagles. Palas, Kohistan, is home to the western tragopan, with many migratory birds visiting from Europe, Central Asia, and India. The southern plains harbor mongooses, small Indian civet, hares, the Asiatic jackal, the Indian pangolin, the jungle cat, and the sand cat. Indus is home to mugger crocodiles, while surrounding areas host wild boars, deer, and porcupines. Central Pakistan&#x27;s sandy scrublands shelter Asiatic jackals, striped hyenas, wildcats, and leopards. The mountainous north hosts a variety of animals like the Marco Polo sheep, urial, markhor goat, ibex goat, Asian black bear, and Himalayan brown bear.

The lack of vegetative cover, severe climate, and grazing impact on deserts have endangered wild animals. The chinkara is the only animal found in significant numbers in Cholistan, with a few nilgai along the Pakistan–India border and in some parts of Cholistan. Rare animals include the snow leopard and the blind Indus river dolphin, of which there are believed to be about 1,816 remaining, protected at the Indus Dolphin Reserve in Sindh. In total, 174 species of mammals, 177 species of reptiles, 22 species of amphibians, 198 species of freshwater fish, 668 species of birds, over 5,000 species of insects, and over 5,700 species of plants have been recorded in Pakistan. Pakistan faces deforestation, hunting, and pollution, with a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.42/10, ranking 41st globally out of 172 countries.

== Government and politics ==
Pakistan operates as a democratic parliamentary federal republic, with Islam designated as the state religion. Initially adopting a constitution in 1956, Pakistan saw it suspended by Ayub Khan in 1958, replaced by a second constitution in 1962. A comprehensive constitution emerged in 1973, suspended by Zia-ul-Haq in 1977 but reinstated in 1985, shaping the country&#x27;s governance. The military&#x27;s influence in mainstream politics has been significant throughout Pakistan&#x27;s history. The eras of 1958–1971, 1977–1988, and 1999–2008 witnessed military coups, leading to martial law and military leaders governing de facto as presidents. Presently, Pakistan operates a multi-party parliamentary system, with distinct checks and balances among government branches. The first successful democratic transition occurred in May 2013. Pakistani politics revolves around a blend of socialism, conservatism, and the third way, with the three main political parties being the conservative PML (N), socialist PPP, and centrist PTI. Constitutional amendments in 2010 curtailed presidential powers, enhancing the role of the prime minister.
* Head of State: The ceremonial head of the state and civilian commander-in-chief of the Pakistan Armed Forces is the President, elected by an Electoral College. The Prime Minister advises the President on key appointments, including military and judicial positions, and the President is constitutionally bound to act on this advice. The President also holds powers to pardon and grant clemency.
* Legislative: The bicameral legislature includes a 96-member Senate (upper house) and a 336-member National Assembly (lower house). National Assembly members are elected via first-past-the-post under universal adult suffrage, representing National Assembly constituencies. The constitution reserves 70 seats for women and religious minorities, allocated to political parties based on proportional representation. Senate members are elected by provincial legislators, ensuring equal representation across all provinces.

* Executive: The Prime Minister, typically the leader of the majority rule party or coalition in the National Assembly (the lower house), serves as the country&#x27;s chief executive and head of government. Responsibilities include forming a cabinet, making executive decisions, and appointing senior civil servants, subject to executive confirmation.
* Provincial governments: Each of the four provinces follows a similar governance system, with a directly elected Provincial Assembly choosing the Chief Minister, usually from the largest party or coalition. Chief Ministers lead the provincial cabinet and oversee provincial governance. The Chief Secretary, appointed by the Prime Minister, heads the provincial bureaucracy. Provincial assemblies legislate and approve the provincial budget, typically presented by the provincial finance minister annually. Ceremonial heads of provinces, the Provincial Governors, are appointed by the President based on the binding advice of the Prime Minister.

* Judicature: The judiciary in Pakistan has two classes: the superior and subordinate judiciary. The superior judiciary includes the Supreme Court of Pakistan, Federal Shariat Court, and five high courts, with the Supreme Court at the top. It&#x27;s responsible for safeguarding the constitution. Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan have their own court systems.

=== Role of Islam ===

Pakistan, the only country established in the name of Islam, had overwhelming support among Muslims, especially in provinces like the United Provinces, where Muslims were a minority. This idea, articulated by the Muslim League, the Islamic clergy, and Jinnah, envisioned an Islamic state. Jinnah, closely associated with the &quot;ulama&quot;, was described upon his death by Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani as the greatest Muslim after Aurangzeb, aspiring to unite Muslims worldwide under Islam.

The Objectives Resolution of March 1949 marked the initial step towards this goal, affirming God as the sole sovereign. Muslim League leader Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman asserted that Pakistan could only truly become an Islamic state after bringing all believers of Islam into a single political unit. Keith Callard observed that Pakistanis believed in the essential unity of purpose and outlook in the Muslim world, expecting similar views on religion and nationality from Muslims worldwide.

Pakistan&#x27;s desire for a united Islamic bloc, called Islamistan, wasn&#x27;t supported by other Muslim governments, though figures like the Grand Mufti of Palestine, Al-Haj Amin al-Husseini, and leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood were drawn to the country. Pakistan&#x27;s desire for an international organization of Muslim countries was fulfilled in the 1970s when the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) was formed. East Pakistan&#x27;s Bengali Muslims, opposed to an Islamist state, clashed with West Pakistanis who leaned towards Islamic identity. The Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami backed an Islamic state and opposed Bengali nationalism.

After the 1970 general elections, the Parliament crafted the 1973 Constitution. It declared Pakistan an Islamic Republic, with Islam as the state religion, and mandated laws to comply with Islamic teachings laid down in the Quran and Sunnah and that no law repugnant to such injunctions could be enacted. Additionally, it established institutions like the Shariat Court and the Council of Islamic Ideology to interpret and apply Islam.

Zulfikar Ali Bhutto faced opposition under the banner of &quot;Nizam-e-Mustafa&quot; (&quot;Rule of the Prophet&quot;), advocating an Islamic state. Bhutto conceded to some Islamist demands before being ousted in a coup.

General Zia-ul-Haq, after seizing power, committed to establishing an Islamic state and enforcing &quot;sharia&quot; law. He instituted Shariat judicial courts, and court benches, to adjudicate using Islamic doctrine. Zia aligned with Deobandi institutions, exacerbating sectarian tensions with anti-Shia policies.

Most Pakistanis, according to a Pew Research Center (PEW) poll, favor Sharia law as the official law, and 94 percent of them identify more with religion than nationality compared to Muslims in other nations.

=== Administrative units ===

Pakistan, a federal parliamentary republic, consists of four provinces: Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, and Balochistan, along with three territories: Islamabad Capital Territory, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Kashmir. The Government of Pakistan governs the western parts of the Kashmir Region, organized into separate political entities, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. In 2009, the constitutional assignment () granted Gilgit-Baltistan semi-provincial status, providing it with self-government.

The local government system consists of districts, tehsils, and union councils, with an elected body at each tier.

=== Foreign relations ===
Since independence, Pakistan has aimed to maintain an independent foreign policy. Pakistan&#x27;s foreign policy and geostrategy focus on the economy, security, national identity, and territorial integrity, as well as building close ties with other Muslim nations. According to Hasan Askari Rizvi, a foreign policy expert, &quot;Pakistan highlights sovereign equality of states, bilateralism, mutuality of interests, and non-interference in each other&#x27;s domestic affairs as the cardinal features of its foreign policy.&quot;

The Kashmir conflict remains a major issue between Pakistan and India, with three of their four wars fought over it. Due partly to strained relations with India, Pakistan has close ties with Turkey and Iran, both focal points in its foreign policy. Saudi Arabia also holds importance in Pakistan&#x27;s foreign relations.

As a non-signatory of the Treaty on Nuclear Non-Proliferation, Pakistan holds influence in the IAEA. For years, Pakistan has blocked an international treaty to limit fissile material, arguing that its stockpile does not meet its long-term needs. Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear program in the 20th century aimed to counter India&#x27;s nuclear ambitions in the region, and reciprocal nuclear tests ensued after India&#x27;s nuclear tests, solidifying Pakistan as a nuclear power. Pakistan maintains a policy of Full spectrum deterrence, considering its nuclear program vital for deterring foreign aggression.

Located strategically in the world&#x27;s major maritime oil supply lines and communication fiber optic corridors, Pakistan also enjoys proximity to the natural resources of Central Asian countries. Pakistan actively participates in the United Nations with a Permanent Representative representing its positions in international politics. It has advocated for the concept of &quot;enlightened moderation&quot; in the Muslim world. Pakistan is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, SAARC, ECO, and the G20 developing nations.

Pakistan is designated as an &quot;Iron Brother&quot; by China, emphasizing the significance of their close and supportive relationship. In the 1950s, Pakistan opposed the Soviet Union for geopolitical reasons. During the Soviet–Afghan War in the 1980s, it was a close ally of the United States. Relations with Russia have improved since the end of the Cold War, but Pakistan&#x27;s relationship with the United States has been &quot;on-and-off.&quot; Initially a close ally during the Cold War, Pakistan&#x27;s relations with the US soured in the 1990s due to sanctions over its secretive nuclear program. Since 9/11, Pakistan has been a US ally on counterterrorism, but their relationship has been strained due to diverging interests and mistrust during the 20-year war and terrorism issues. Although Pakistan was granted major non-NATO ally status by the U.S. in 2004, it faced accusations of supporting the Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan.

Pakistan does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel; nonetheless, an exchange occurred between the two countries in 2005, with Turkey acting as an intermediary.

==== Relations with China ====

Pakistan was among the first nations to establish formal diplomatic ties with the China, forging a strong relationship since China&#x27;s 1962 conflict with India, culminating in a special bond. During the 1970s, Pakistan acted as an intermediary in U.S.-China rapprochement, facilitating US President Richard Nixon&#x27;s historic visit to China. Despite changes in Pakistani governance and regional/global dynamics, China&#x27;s influence in Pakistan remains paramount. In reciprocation, China stands as Pakistan&#x27;s largest trading partner, with substantial investment in Pakistani infrastructure, notably the Gwadar port. In 2015 alone, they inked 51 agreements and Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) for cooperative efforts. Both nations signed a Free Trade Agreement in 2006, with China making its largest investment in Pakistan&#x27;s history through CPEC. Pakistan acts as China&#x27;s liaison to the Muslim world, and both nations support each other on sensitive issues like Kashmir, Taiwan, Xinjiang, and more.

==== Relations with the Muslim world ====
After Independence, Pakistan vigorously pursued bilateral relations with other Muslim countries. The Ali brothers sought to project Pakistan as the natural leader of the Islamic world, partly due to its significant manpower and military strength. Khaliquzzaman, a prominent Muslim League leader, declared Pakistan&#x27;s ambition to unite all Muslim countries into Islamistan, a pan-Islamic entity.

These developments, alongside Pakistan&#x27;s creation, didn&#x27;t receive approval from the United States, with British Prime Minister Clement Attlee expressing a hope for India and Pakistan to reunite. However, due to a nationalist awakening in the Arab world at that time, there was little interest in Pakistan&#x27;s Pan-Islamic aspirations. Some Arab countries perceived the &#x27;Islamistan&#x27; project as Pakistan&#x27;s bid to dominate other Muslim states.

Pakistan&#x27;s founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, consistently advocated for the Palestinian cause, shaping Pakistan&#x27;s foreign policy to support Palestinian rights within the broader framework of Muslim solidarity. During the 1967 Arab-Israel war, Pakistan supported the Arab states and played a key role in securing Iran&#x27;s backing for the Arab cause both within the U.N. and beyond.

Pakistan&#x27;s relations with Iran have been strained by sectarian tensions, with both Iran and Saudi Arabia using Pakistan as a battleground for their proxy sectarian war. Since the early days of the Iran–Iraq war, President Zia-ul-Haq played an important mediatory role, with Pakistan actively engaging in efforts to end the conflict. Pakistan provided support to Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War. Pakistan chose to remain neutral during Operation Decisive Storm, refraining from sending military support to Saudi Arabia in its offensive against Yemen. Instead, Pakistan aimed to play a proactive diplomatic role in resolving the crisis, which led to tensions between the two countries. In 2016, Pakistan mediated between Saudi Arabia and Iran following the execution of Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, with visits to both countries by then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and the Chief of Army Staff, Raheel Sharif.

Pakistan provided refuge to millions of displaced Afghans after the Soviet invasion and supported the Afghan mujahideen in their efforts to expel Soviet forces from Afghanistan. After the Soviets withdrew, infighting erupted among Mujahideen factions over control of Afghanistan. Pakistan facilitated peace talks to help end the conflict. After four years of unresolved conflict between rival Mujahideen groups, Pakistan helped establish the Taliban as a stabilizing force. Pakistan&#x27;s support for the Sunni Taliban in Afghanistan challenged Shia-led Iran, which opposed a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.

Pakistan vigorously advocated for self-determination among Muslims globally. Its efforts in supporting independence movements in countries like Indonesia, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, and Eritrea fostered strong ties. Due to its support for Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Pakistan has not established diplomatic relations with Armenia.

Pakistan and Bangladesh have experienced strained relations, particularly under the Awami League governments led by Sheikh Hasina, driven by her pro-India stance and historical grievances.

Pakistan, a prominent member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), prioritizes maintaining cultural, political, social, and economic relations with Arab and other Muslim-majority nations in its foreign policy.

=== Kashmir conflict ===
Kashmir, a Himalayan region at the northern tip of the Indian subcontinent, was governed as the autonomous princely state of Jammu and Kashmir during the British Raj before the Partition of India in August 1947. This sparked a major territorial dispute between India and Pakistan, resulting in several conflicts over the region. India controls about 45.1% of Kashmir, including Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, while Pakistan controls roughly 38.2%, comprising Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit−Baltistan. Additionally, about 20% of the region, known as Aksai Chin and the Shaksgam Valley, is under Chinese control. India claims the entire Kashmir region based on the Instrument of Accession signed by the princely state&#x27;s ruler, Maharaja Hari Singh, while Pakistan argues for its Muslim-majority population, and geographical proximity to Pakistan. The United Nations was involved in resolving the conflict, leading to a ceasefire in 1949 and the establishment of the Line of Control (LoC) as a &quot;de facto&quot; border. India, fearing Kashmir&#x27;s secession, did not hold the promised plebiscite, as it believed Kashmiris would vote to join Pakistan.

Pakistan claims that its position is for the right of the Kashmiri people to determine their future through impartial elections as mandated by the United Nations, while India has stated that Kashmir is an &quot;integral part&quot; of India, referring to the 1972 Simla Agreement and to the fact that regional elections take place regularly. Certain Kashmiri independence groups believe that Kashmir should be independent of both India and Pakistan.
=== Military ===

The armed forces of Pakistan rank sixth globally in personnel size, with about 660,000 on active duty and 291,000 paramilitary personnel as of 2024. Established in 1947, they&#x27;ve wielded significant influence over national politics. The main branches include the Army, Navy, and Air Force, supported by numerous paramilitaries.

The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) is the highest-ranking military officer, advising the civilian government. However, they lack direct command over the branches and serve as intermediaries, ensuring communication between the military and civilian leadership. Overseeing the Joint Staff Headquarters, they coordinate inter-service cooperation and joint military missions.

Command and control over Pakistan&#x27;s strategic arsenal development and employment is vested in the National Command Authority, overseeing work on nuclear doctrine to maintain Full spectrum deterrence.

The United States, Turkey, and China maintain close military relations with Pakistan Armed Forces, regularly exporting military equipment and technology transfer. Pakistan was the 5th-largest recipient and importer of arms between 2019 and 2023.

==== Military history ====

Since 1947, Pakistan has been involved in four conventional wars with India. The first conflict took place in Kashmir and ended in a United Nations-mediated ceasefire, with Pakistan gaining control of one-third of the region. Territorial disputes led to another war in 1965. In 1971, India and Pakistan fought another war over East Pakistan, with Indian forces aiding its independence, leading to the creation of Bangladesh. Tensions in Kargil brought the two countries to the brink of war.

During the Soviet-Afghan War, Pakistan&#x27;s intelligence community, mostly the ISI, coordinated US resources to support Afghan mujahideen and foreign fighters against Soviet presence. The PAF engaged with Soviet and Afghan Air Forces during the conflict. Pakistan has been an active participant in UN peacekeeping missions, playing a major role in operations like the rescue mission in Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1993. According to a 2023 UN report, the Pakistani military was the fifth largest troop contributor to UN peacekeeping missions.

Pakistan has deployed its military in some Arab countries, providing defense, training, and advisory roles. The PAF and Navy&#x27;s fighter pilots served in Arab nations&#x27; militaries against Israel in the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War. Pakistani special forces assisted Saudi forces in Mecca during the Grand Mosque Seizure. Pakistan also sent 5,000 troops as part of a US-led coalition for the defense of Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War.

Despite the UN arms embargo on Bosnia, the ISI under General Javed Nasir airlifted anti-tank weapons and missiles to Bosnian mujahideen, shifting the tide in favor of Bosnian Muslims. ISI, under Nasir&#x27;s leadership, supported Chinese Muslims in Xinjiang, rebel groups in the Philippines, and religious groups in Central Asia.

Since 2004, the military has been engaged in an insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, primarily against Tehrik-i-Taliban factions. Major operations include Operation Black Thunderstorm, Operation Rah-e-Nijat, and Operation Zarb-e-Azb.

=== Law enforcement ===

Law enforcement in Pakistan consists of federal and provincial police agencies. Each of the four provinces (Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan) has its own police force, while the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) has the Islamabad Police. Provincial police forces are led by an Inspector-General of Police (IGP) appointed by provincial governments. However, top officers are from the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP), ensuring national standards across provincial forces.

Specialized Units:

* National Highways &amp; Motorway Police (NHMP): Enforces traffic laws and ensures safety on Pakistan&#x27;s inter-provincial motorway network.
* Elite Police Units: Each provincial police force, such as the Punjab Elite Force, focuses on counter-terrorism operations and high-risk situations.

The Civil Armed Forces (CAF) support regular law enforcement agencies, aiding in tasks like riot control, counter-insurgency, and border security, enhancing Pakistan&#x27;s law enforcement capabilities.

The National Intelligence Coordination Committee oversees intelligence activities at federal and provincial levels, including the ISI, MI, IB, FIA, Police, and Civil Armed Forces. Pakistan&#x27;s primary intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), was established within a year of Pakistan&#x27;s independence in 1947.

===Human rights===

In 2018, Pakistan ranked 139 out of 180 countries in the Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders, highlighting restrictions on freedom of the press. Television stations and newspapers face closures for publishing reports critical of the government or military. Male homosexuality is illegal in Pakistan, punishable with up to life in prison.

== Economy ==


Pakistan&#x27;s economy ranks 24th globally by purchasing power parity (PPP) and 43rd by nominal GDP. Historically, Pakistan was part of the wealthiest region in the first millennium CE, but lost ground to regions like China and Western Europe by the 18th century. Pakistan is a developing country, and part of the Next Eleven, poised to become one of the world&#x27;s largest economies in the 21st century, alongside the BRICS.

In recent years, Pakistan has faced social instability and macroeconomic imbalances, with deficiencies in services like rail transportation and electrical energy generation. The semi-industrialized economy has growth centers along the Indus River. The diversified economies of Karachi and Punjab&#x27;s urban centers coexist with less-developed areas in other parts of the country, particularly in Balochistan. Pakistan ranks as the 67th-largest export economy and the 106th-most complex economy globally, with a negative trade balance of US$23.96 billion in fiscal year 2015–16.

, Pakistan&#x27;s estimated nominal GDP is US$376.493 billion. The GDP by PPP is US$1.512 trillion. The estimated nominal per capita GDP is US$1,658, the GDP (PPP)/capita is US$6,662 (international dollars), According to the World Bank, Pakistan has important strategic endowments and development potential. The increasing proportion of Pakistan&#x27;s youth provides the country with both a potential demographic dividend and a challenge to provide adequate services and employment. 21.04% of the population live below the international poverty line of US$1.25 a day. The unemployment rate among the aged 15 and over population is 5.5%. Pakistan has an estimated 40 million middle class citizens, projected to increase to 100 million by 2050. A 2015 report published by the World Bank ranked Pakistan&#x27;s economy at 24th-largest in the world by purchasing power and 41st-largest in absolute terms. It is South Asia&#x27;s second-largest economy, representing about 15.0% of regional GDP.

Pakistan&#x27;s economic growth varied over time, with slow progress during democratic transitions but robust expansion under martial law, lacking sustainable foundations. Rapid reforms in the early to mid-2000s, including increased development spending, reduced poverty by 10% and boosted GDP by 3%. The economy cooled post-2007, with inflation peaking at 25.0% in 2008, necessitating IMF intervention to prevent bankruptcy. The Asian Development Bank later noted easing economic strain in Pakistan. Inflation for fiscal year stood at 14.1%. Since 2013, Pakistan&#x27;s economy has seen growth under an IMF program. Goldman Sachs predicted Pakistan&#x27;s economy could grow 15 times by 2050, and Ruchir Sharma in his 2016 book anticipated a transformation to a middle-income country by 2020.

Pakistan&#x27;s vast natural commodity production and 10th-largest labour market, along with a US$19.9 billion contribution from its 7-million-strong diaspora in 2015–16, position it significantly. However, Pakistan&#x27;s global export share is declining, accounting for just 0.13% in 2007 according to the World Trade Organization.

=== Agriculture and mining sector ===

The Pakistani economy has shifted from agriculture to services, with agriculture contributing only 20.9% of the GDP as of 2015. Despite this, Pakistan&#x27;s wheat production in 2005 surpassed Africa&#x27;s and nearly matched South America&#x27;s, highlighting its agricultural significance. The sector employs 43.5% of the labor force and is a major source of foreign exchange.

Manufactured exports, heavily reliant on agricultural raw materials like cotton and hides, face inflationary pressures due to supply shortages and market disruptions. Pakistan ranks fifth in cotton production, self-sufficient in sugarcane, and the fourth-largest milk producer globally. Though land and water resources haven&#x27;t increased proportionately, productivity gains, especially from the Green Revolution in the late 1960s and 1970s, significantly boosted wheat and rice yields. Private tube wells and High Yielding Varieties (HYVs) further augmented crop yields. Meat industry accounts for 1.4 percent of overall GDP.

=== Industry ===


Industry, constituting 19.74% of GDP and 24% of total employment, is the second-largest sector. Large-scale manufacturing (LSM) dominates, representing 12.2% of GDP, with cement production thriving due to demand from Afghanistan and the domestic real estate sector. In 2013, Pakistan exported 7,708,557 metric tons of cement, with an installed capacity of 44,768,250 metric tons. The textile industry, a key player in Pakistan&#x27;s manufacturing, contributes 9.5% to GDP and employs around 15 million people. Pakistan ranks fourth globally in cotton production, with substantial spinning capacity, making it a major exporter of textile products in Asia. China is a significant buyer of Pakistani textiles, importing US$1.527 billion worth of textiles last fiscal year.

=== Services ===

As of 2014–15, the services sector contributes 58.8% to GDP, serving as the main driver of economic growth in Pakistan, with a consumption-oriented society. The sector&#x27;s growth rate surpasses that of agriculture and industry, accounting for 54% of GDP and over one-third of total employment. It has strong linkages with other sectors, providing essential inputs to agriculture and manufacturing. Pakistan&#x27;s IT sector is one of the fastest-growing, ranked 110th for ICT development by the World Economic Forum. With around 82 million internet users as of May 2020, Pakistan ranks 9th globally, and its ICT industry is projected to exceed $10 billion by 2020. With 12,000 employees, Pakistan is among the top five freelancing nations, and its export performance in telecom, computer, and information services has notably improved.

=== Tourism ===


With its diverse cultures, landscapes, and attractions, Pakistan drew around 6.6 million foreign tourists in 2018. However, this was a decline from the peak of tourism in the 1970s driven by the popular Hippie trail. Pakistan boasts attractions from mangroves in the south to Himalayan hill stations in the northeast, including ancient Buddhist ruins of Takht-i-Bahi and Taxila, the 5,000-year-old Indus Valley civilization sites such as Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, and numerous mountain peaks over . The northern part of Pakistan boasts numerous old fortresses, showcasing ancient architecture. It encompasses the Hunza and Chitral valleys, where the small pre-Islamic Kalasha community resides, claiming descent from Alexander the Great. Lahore, Pakistan&#x27;s cultural capital, showcases numerous examples of Mughal architecture, including the Badshahi Masjid, the Shalimar Gardens, the Tomb of Jahangir, and the Lahore Fort. Following the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, &quot;The Guardian&quot; highlighted &quot;The top five tourist sites in Pakistan&quot; to boost tourism, featuring destinations like Taxila, Lahore, the Karakoram Highway, Karimabad, and Lake Saiful Muluk. Festivals and government initiatives aim to promote Pakistan&#x27;s cultural heritage. In 2015, the World Economic Forum ranked Pakistan 125th out of 141 countries in its Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Report.

== Infrastructure ==

Pakistan was lauded as the top nation for infrastructure development in South Asia during the 2016 annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank.

=== Power and energy ===

As of May 2021, Pakistan operates six licensed commercial nuclear power plants. The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) oversees these plants, while the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority ensures their safe operation. These plants contribute approximately 5.8% to Pakistan&#x27;s electricity supply, while fossil fuels (crude oil and natural gas) provide 64.2%, hydroelectric power provides 29.9%, and coal contributes 0.1%. The KANUPP-I, Pakistan&#x27;s first commercial nuclear power plant, was supplied by Canada in 1971. Sino-Pakistani nuclear cooperation began in the 1980s, leading to the establishment of CHASNUPP-I. In 2005, both countries proposed a joint energy security plan, aiming for a generation capacity exceeding 160,000 MWe by 2030. Pakistan&#x27;s Nuclear Energy Vision 2050 targets a capacity of 40,000 MWe, with 8,900 MWe expected by 2030.

In June 2008, the nuclear complex at Chashma in Punjab Province expanded with the installation of Chashma-III and Chashma–IV reactors, each with 325–340 MWe, costing ₨129 billion, with ₨80 billion from international sources, mainly China. Another agreement for China&#x27;s assistance was signed in October 2008, seen as a response to the US–India agreement. The project&#x27;s cost was then US$1.7 billion, with a foreign loan of US$1.07 billion. In 2013, Pakistan established a second nuclear complex in Karachi with plans for additional reactors, similar to Chashma. Electrical energy in Pakistan is generated by various corporations and distributed evenly among the four provinces by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA). However, Karachi-based K-Electric and Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) generate much of the electricity used in Pakistan and collect revenue nationwide. In 2023, Pakistan&#x27;s installed electricity generation capacity was ~45,885 MWt. Pakistan produced 1,135 megawatts of renewable energy for the month of October 2016. Pakistan expects to produce 10,000 megawatts of renewable energy by 2025.

=== Transport ===

Pakistan boasts 2567 km of motorways and approximately 263,942 km of highways, which handle 92% of passengers and 96% of freight traffic. Despite constituting only 4.6% of the total road length, these north–south links manage 85% of the nation&#x27;s traffic. They connect southern seaports such as Karachi port and Port Qasim in Sindh, along with Gwadar Port and Port of Pasni in Balochistan, to populous provinces like Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa domestically, and neighboring countries like Afghanistan, Central Asia, and China through the China Pakistan Economic Corridor. According to the WEF&#x27;s Global Competitiveness Report, Pakistan&#x27;s port infrastructure quality ratings rose from 3.7 to 4.1 between 2007 and 2016. The railway&#x27;s share of inland traffic is reduced to below 8% for passengers and 4% for freight. This shift led to a decrease in total rail track from in 1990–91 to in 2011.

The transport landscape of Pakistan features various modern transit systems. The Orange Line Metro Train in Lahore, inaugurated in 2020, spans , and includes both elevated and underground sections, accommodating over 250,000 passengers daily. Lahore also boasts the Lahore Metrobus, the first of its kind in Pakistan, operational since February 2013. The Rawalpindi-Islamabad Metrobus, stretching 48.1 km, commenced its first phase in June 2015, with subsequent extensions, and employs e-ticketing and an Intelligent Transportation System. Multan Metrobus, inaugurated in January 2017, serves Multan with its rapid transit services. Peshawar&#x27;s Bus Rapid Transit, inaugurated in August 2020, marks the fourth BRT system in Pakistan. Karachi&#x27;s Green Line Metrobus, operational since December 2021, is part of a larger metrobus project financed by the Government of Pakistan and initiated in February 2016. Meanwhile, Faisalabad awaits its proposed rapid transit project, the Faisalabad Metrobus. Karachi Circular Railway, partially revived in November 2020, offers public transit services in the Karachi metropolitan area. Additionally, plans are underway to resurrect Karachi&#x27;s tramway service, which ceased operations in 1975, in collaboration with Austrian experts.

As of 2013, Pakistan boasts approximately 151 airports and airfields, encompassing both military and civilian installations. Despite Jinnah International Airport serving as the primary international gateway, significant international traffic also flows through Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawar, Quetta, Faisalabad, Sialkot, and Multan airports. The civil aviation industry, deregulated in 1993, operates with a blend of public and private entities while state-owned Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) dominates, carrying 73% of domestic passengers and all domestic freight.

=== Science and technology ===

Developments in science and technology have played a significant role in Pakistan&#x27;s infrastructure, linking the nation to the global community. Each year, the Pakistan Academy of Sciences and the government invite scientists worldwide to the International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics. In 2005, Pakistan hosted an international seminar on &quot;Physics in Developing Countries&quot; for the International Year of Physics. Pakistani theoretical physicist Abdus Salam won a Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the electroweak interaction. Pakistani scientists have made notable contributions in mathematics, biology, economics, computer science, and genetics.

In chemistry, Salimuzzaman Siddiqui identified the medicinal properties of the neem tree&#x27;s components. Ayub K. Ommaya developed the Ommaya reservoir for treating brain conditions. Scientific research is integral to Pakistani universities, national laboratories, science parks, and the industry. Abdul Qadeer Khan spearheaded Pakistan&#x27;s HEU-based gas-centrifuge uranium enrichment program for its atomic bomb project. He established the Kahuta Research Laboratories (KRL) in 1976, serving as both its senior scientist and the Director-General until his retirement in 2001. Besides atomic bomb project, he made significant contributions in molecular morphology, physical martensite, and their applications in condensed and material physics.

In 2010, Pakistan ranked 43rd globally in published scientific papers. The influential Pakistan Academy of Sciences guides the government on science policies. Pakistan was ranked 91st in the Global Innovation Index by 2024.

The 1960s marked the rise of Pakistan&#x27;s space program, led by SUPARCO, yielding advancements in rocketry, electronics, and aeronomy. Notably, Pakistan launched its first rocket into space, pioneering South Asia&#x27;s space exploration. In 1990, it successfully launched its first satellite, becoming the first Muslim nation and second in South Asia to achieve this milestone.

Following the 1971 war with India, Pakistan hastily developed atomic weapons to deter foreign intervention and entered the atomic age. Tensions with India led to Pakistan&#x27;s 1998 underground nuclear tests, making it the seventh country to possess such weapons.

Pakistan is the sole Muslim nation active in Antarctica research, maintaining its Jinnah Antarctic Research Station since 1992. By May 2020, Pakistan had 82 million internet users, ranking ninth globally. The government invests heavily in information technology projects, focusing on e-government and infrastructure.

== Demographics ==


=== Urbanisation ===
Since independence due to the partition of India, urbanisation has surged for various reasons. In the south, Karachi stands as the most populous commercial hub along the Indus River. In the east, west, and north, a dense population arc spans cities like Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Sargodha, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Gujrat, Jhelum, Sheikhupura, Nowshera, Mardan, and Peshawar. By 1990–2008, city dwellers constituted 36% of Pakistan&#x27;s population, making it South Asia&#x27;s most urbanized nation, with over 50% living in towns of 5,000+ inhabitants. Immigration, both domestic and international, significantly fuels urban growth. Migration from India, especially to Karachi, the largest metropolis, and from nearby countries, accelerates urbanization, posing new political and socio-economic challenges. Economic shifts like the green revolution and political developments also play crucial roles.

=== Ethnicity and languages ===

Pakistan is a diverse society with estimates suggesting it has between 75 and 85 languages. Urdu and English serve as the official languages, with Urdu being a unifying force among over 75% of Pakistanis. According to the 2023 national census, the largest ethnolinguistic groups include the Punjabis (36.98%), Pashtuns (18.15%), Sindhis (14.31%), Saraikis (12%), Urdu speaking people (9.25%), Balochs (3.38%), Hindkowans/Hazarewals (2.32%), and Brahuis (1.16%). The remaining population consists of various ethnic minorities such as Kashmiris, Paharis, Chitralis, various peoples of Gilgit-Baltistan, Kohistanis, Torwalis, Meos, Hazaras, Kalash and Siddis. The Pakistani diaspora, numbering over seven million, is the sixth largest in the world.

=== Immigration ===

Even post-1947 partition, Indian Muslims kept migrating to Pakistan, especially Karachi and Sindh province. Wars in neighboring Afghanistan in the 1980s and 1990s pushed millions of Afghan refugees into Pakistan, mainly in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and tribal areas, with some in Karachi and Quetta. Pakistan hosts one of the world&#x27;s largest refugee populations. Additionally, around 2 million Bangladeshis and half a million undocumented individuals, purportedly from Myanmar, reside in Pakistan. In October 2023, Pakistan ordered the deportation of thousands undocumented refugees, citing security concerns.

Migration of Bengalis and Rohingya to Pakistan started in the 1980s and continued till 1998. Karachi hosts a significant number of Bengali settlements, and large Rohingya migration made it one of their largest populations outside Myanmar. Karachi&#x27;s Burmese community resides in various slums across the city.

According to BBC, thousands of Uyghur Muslims live in Gilgit-Baltistan, some left Xinjiang, China and the thriving trading town of Kashgar in 1949, while others are later arrivals, claiming to escape political oppression. Since 1989, thousands of Kashmiri Muslim refugees fled to Pakistan, alleging rape and forced displacement by Indian soldiers.

=== Diaspora ===

According to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Pakistan has the sixth-largest diaspora globally. Approximately 7 million Pakistanis reside abroad, mainly in the Middle East, Europe, and North America. Pakistan ranks 10th globally for remittances sent home. Saudi Arabia is the largest source of remittances, contributing $5.9 billion . The term &quot;Overseas Pakistani&quot; is officially recognized by the Government of Pakistan, with the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development addressing their needs, welfare, and issues. Overseas Pakistanis constitute the second-largest source of foreign exchange remittances to Pakistan, with remittances increasing by over 100% from US$8.9 billion in 2009–10 to US$19.9 billion in 2015–16.

=== Religion ===

Islam is the state religion, with freedom of religion guaranteed by the constitution. The majority are Muslims (96.47%), followed by Hindus (2.14%) and Christians (1.27%). Minorities include Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Zoroastrians (Parsi), and the unique Kalash people who practice animism. Additionally, a small percentage profess no faith, as seen in the 1998 census.

==== Islam ====


Islam dominates in Pakistan, with about 96.5% of the population being Muslim. Pakistan ranks second globally in Muslim population, and is home to 10.5% of the world&#x27;s Muslims. Karachi is the largest Muslim city in the world.

The majority follow Sunni Islam, with a significant presence of Sufism, while Shia Muslims constitute a minority. Shias represent between 5–25%. The Shia population in Pakistan was estimated at 42 million in 2019. , 12% of Pakistani Muslims self-identify as non-denominational Muslims.

The Ahmadis are a minority, officially considered non-Muslims. Ahmadis face persecution, banned from calling themselves Muslims since 1974.

==== Hinduism ====

Hinduism is the second-largest religion, followed by 2.14% of the population according to 2017 census. Pakistan had the fifth-largest Hindu population globally in 2010. In 2017, Hindus numbered 4,444,437. They reside across Pakistan but are concentrated in Sindh, where they make up 8.73% of the population. Umerkot district is the only Hindu majority area. Tharparkar district hosts the largest Hindu population. Four districts – Umerkot, Tharparkar, Mirpurkhas, and Sanghar – have over half of Pakistan&#x27;s Hindus.

At Pakistan&#x27;s inception, the &#x27;hostage theory&#x27; suggested fair treatment of Hindus to safeguard Muslims in India. However, some Pakistani Hindus felt marginalized, leading to emigration to India. They faced violence post the Babri Masjid demolition, enduring forced conversions and abductions.

==== Christianity and other religions ====

Christians are the next largest religious minority after Hindus, constituting 1.27% of the population. They are concentrated in Lahore District (5%) and Islamabad Capital Territory (over 4%). Karachi hosts a historic Roman Catholic community established by Goan and Tamil migrants during British colonial rule.

Following Christianity, the Bahá&#x27;í Faith had 30,000 followers in 2008, followed by Sikhism, Buddhism, and Zoroastrianism, each with around 20,000 adherents in 2008, alongside a small Jain community.

In 2005, 1% of the population identified as atheist. By 2012, this figure had risen to 2.0% according to Gallup.

=== Education ===


Pakistan&#x27;s constitution mandates free primary and secondary education, with public universities established in each province, including Punjab University, Sindh University, Peshawar University, Karachi University, and Balochistan University. The country&#x27;s educational landscape encompasses both public and private universities, fostering collaboration to enhance research and higher education opportunities, albeit with concerns regarding teaching quality in newer institutions. Technical and vocational institutions in Pakistan number approximately 3,193, complemented by &quot;madrassahs&quot; providing free Islamic education to students, with government efforts to regulate and monitor their quality amidst concerns over extremists recruitment. Education is divided into six main levels, including nursery, primary, middle, matriculation, intermediate, and university programs. Additionally, private schools offer a parallel secondary education system based on the curriculum set by the Cambridge International Examinations, with 439 international schools reported in Pakistan.

Initiatives since 2007 made English medium education mandatory nationwide. Following a 2012 attack on activist Malala Yousafzai by the Taliban, she became the youngest Nobel laureate for her education advocacy. Reforms in 2013 mandated Chinese language courses in Sindh, reflecting China&#x27;s growing influence. As of 2018, Pakistan&#x27;s literacy rate stands at 62.3%, with significant regional and gender disparities. Government initiatives, including computer literacy since 1995, aim to eradicate illiteracy, targeting 100% enrollment among primary school-age children and an ~86% literacy rate by 2015. Pakistan allocates 2.3% of its GDP to education, among the lowest in South Asia.
== Culture ==

Civil society in Pakistan is hierarchical, emphasizing local cultural etiquette and traditional Islamic values. The primary family unit is the extended family, but there&#x27;s a rising trend towards nuclear families due to socio-economic factors. Both men and women typically wear &quot;Shalwar Kameez&quot;; men also favor trousers, jeans, and shirts. The middle class has grown to about 35 million, with another 17 million in the upper and upper-middle classes, leading to a shift in power from rural landowners to urban elites. Festivals like &quot;Eid-ul-Fitr&quot;, &quot;Eid-ul-Azha&quot;, Ramadan, Christmas, Easter, Holi, and Diwali are primarily religious. Pakistan ranks 56th on the A.T. Kearney/FP Globalization Index due to increasing globalization.

=== Architecture ===

Four periods define Pakistani architecture: pre-Islamic, Islamic, colonial, and post-colonial. The onset of the Indus civilization around the mid-3rd millennium BCE heralded an urban culture, evidenced by surviving large structures. Notable pre-Islamic settlements include Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, and Kot Diji. The fusion of Buddhism and Greek influences birthed a distinctive Greco-Buddhist style from the 1st century CE, exemplified by the renowned Gandhara style. Notable Buddhist architectural remnants include the Takht-i-Bahi monastery in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The advent of Islam in present-day Pakistan marked the cessation of Buddhist architecture, ushering in Islamic architecture. The notable Indo-Islamic structure, the tomb of Shah Rukn-i-Alam in Multan, remains significant. During the Mughal era, Persian-Islamic design merged with Hindustani art, seen in Lahore&#x27;s architectural gems like the Badshahi Mosque and the Lahore Fort with the iconic Alamgiri Gate. Lahore also boasts the vibrant Wazir Khan Mosque, and the lush Shalimar Gardens. In the British colonial period, Indo-European buildings emerged, blending European and Indian-Islamic styles. Post-colonial identity shines through modern landmarks like the Faisal Mosque, Minar-e-Pakistan, and Mazar-e-Quaid. British architectural influence persists in structures across Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi.

=== Clothing, arts, and fashion ===
The &quot;Shalwar Kameez&quot; is Pakistan&#x27;s national dress, worn in all provinces: Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Azad Kashmir. Each province has its own style. Pakistanis wear a variety of fabrics like silk, chiffon, and cotton. In addition to the national dress, men often wear domestically tailored suits and neckties, especially in offices, schools, and social gatherings.

Pakistan&#x27;s fashion industry has thrived, blending traditional and modern styles to create a unique cultural identity. Regional and traditional dress remain significant symbols of native tradition, evolving into both modern and purer forms. Organizations like the Pakistan Fashion Design Council in Lahore and the Fashion Pakistan Council in Karachi host events like PFDC Fashion Week and Fashion Pakistan Week. Pakistan&#x27;s inaugural fashion week took place in November 2009.

=== Literature and philosophy ===

Pakistan boasts literature in various languages including Urdu, Sindhi, Punjabi, Pashto, Baluchi, Persian, English, and more. The Pakistan Academy of Letters actively promotes literature and poetry both domestically and internationally. National Library contributes to literary dissemination. Historically, Pakistani literature consisted mainly of lyric, religious, and folkloric works, later diversifying under colonial influence into prose fiction, now widely embraced.

The national poet of Pakistan, Muhammad Iqbal, wrote influential poetry in Urdu and Persian, advocating for Islamic civilizational revival. Notable figures in contemporary Urdu literature include Josh Malihabadi, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, and Saadat Hasan Manto. Popular Sufi poets like Shah Abdul Latif and Bulleh Shah are revered. Mirza Kalich Beg is hailed as the father of modern Sindhi prose. Pakistani philosophy has been shaped by influences from British and American philosophy, with notable figures like M. M. Sharif contributing to its development. Post-1971, Marxist thought gained prominence in Pakistani philosophy through figures like Jalaludin Abdur Rahim.

=== Media and entertainment ===
The private print media, state-owned Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV), and Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) dominated media until the 21st century. Pakistan now boasts a vast network of domestic, privately owned 24-hour news media and television channels. A 2021 report by the Reporters Without Borders ranked Pakistan 157th among 180 nations on the Press Freedom Index, citing pressures faced by Pakistani reporters, particularly when reporting against the army or government. The BBC describes Pakistani media as &quot;among the most outspoken in South Asia&quot;. Pakistani media has been instrumental in exposing corruption.

The Lollywood, Punjabi, and Pashto film industry is centered in Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar. Although Bollywood films were banned from public cinemas from 1965 to 2008, they remained influential in Pakistani popular culture. However, in 2019, the screening of Bollywood movies faced an indefinite ban. Despite challenges faced by the Pakistani film industry, Urdu televised dramas and theatrical performances remain popular, frequently broadcast by many entertainment media outlets. Urdu dramas dominate the television entertainment industry, renowned for their quality since the 1990s. Pakistani music encompasses diverse forms, from provincial folk music and traditional styles like Qawwali and Ghazal Gayaki to modern fusions of traditional and western music. Pakistan boasts numerous renowned folk singers, and the arrival of Afghan refugees in western provinces has sparked interest in Pashto music, despite occasional intolerance.

=== Cuisine ===

Pakistani cuisine, rooted in the royal kitchens of 16th-century Mughal emperors, blends influences from British, Indian, Central Asian, and Middle Eastern culinary traditions. Unlike Middle Eastern fare, Pakistani dishes are heavily spiced with garlic, ginger, turmeric, chili, and garam masala. Roti, a wheat-based flatbread, accompanies most meals, alongside curry, meat, vegetables, and lentils. Rice is also common, served plain, spiced, or in sweet dishes. Lassi, a traditional drink from the Punjab region, and black tea with milk and sugar are popular beverages enjoyed nationwide. Sohan halwa, a beloved sweet dish from southern Punjab, is savored across Pakistan.

=== Sports ===

Cricket is the most popular sport in Pakistan, followed by football. Field hockey is the national sport. Other sports like squash, polo, and traditional games are also enjoyed.

In cricket, Pakistan boasts victories in all major ICC tournaments, including the ICC Cricket World Cup, ICC World Twenty20, and ICC Champions Trophy. The Pakistan Super League ranks among the top T20 leagues globally.

In football, Pakistan established the Pakistan Football Federation soon after its creation, and it is known for producing FIFA World Cup balls.

In field hockey, Pakistan boasts four Hockey World Cup wins, eight Asian Games gold medals, and three Olympic gold medals. Squash player Jahangir Khan holds the record for the longest winning streak in professional sport history, winning 555 consecutive matches. Pakistan has hosted various international events, including Cricket and Hockey World Cups and Asian Games.

<doc id="23237" wikidata="Q839778" url="?curid=23237" title="Geography of China">
<text>China has great physical diversity. The eastern plain and southern coasts of the country consist of fertile lowlands and foothills. They are the location of most of China&#x27;s agricultural output and human population. The southern areas of the country (south of the Yangtze River) consist of hilly and mountainous terrain. The west and north of the country are dominated by sunken basins (such as the Gobi and the Taklamakan), rolling plateaus, and towering massifs. It contains part of the highest tableland on earth, the Tibetan Plateau, and has much lower agricultural potential and population.

Traditionally, the Chinese population centered on the Chinese Central Plain, developing as a country whose center lay in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River on the northern plains. More recently, the coastline has been used extensively for export-oriented trade, causing the coastal provinces to become the leading economic center.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China has an area of about . The exact land area is sometimes challenged by border disputes, most notably about Taiwan, Aksai Chin, the Trans-Karakoram Tract, and South Tibet. The area of the People&#x27;s Republic of China is according to the CIA&#x27;s &quot;The World Factbook&quot;. The People&#x27;s Republic of China is either the third or fourth-largest country in the world, being either slightly larger or slightly smaller than the United States, depending on how the area of the United States is measured. Both countries are smaller than Russia and Canada and larger than Brazil.

==Physical geography==

=== Generalities ===

The topography of China has been divided by the Chinese government into five homogeneous physical macro-regions, namely Eastern China (subdivided into the northeast plain, north plain, and southern hills), Xinjiang-Mongolia, and the Tibetan highlands. It is diverse with snow-capped mountains, deep river valleys, broad basins, high plateaus, rolling plains, terraced hills, sandy dunes with many other geographic features and other landforms present in myriad variations. In general, the land is high in the west and descends to the east coast. Mountains (33 percent), plateaus (26 percent), and hills (10 percent) account for nearly 70 percent of the country&#x27;s land surface. Most of the country&#x27;s arable land and population are based in lowland plains (12 percent) and basins (19 percent), though some of the greatest basins are filled with deserts. The country&#x27;s rugged terrain presents problems for the construction of overland transportation infrastructure and requires extensive terracing to sustain agriculture, but is conducive to the development of forestry, mineral and hydropower resources, as well as tourism in the country.

=== Eastern China ===

;Northeast Plain
Northeast of Shanhaiguan a narrow sliver of flat coastal land opens up into the vast Northeast China Plain. The plains extend north to the crown of the &quot;Chinese rooster&quot;, near where the Greater and Lesser Hinggan ranges converge. The Changbai Mountains to the east divide China from the Korean peninsula.

; North plain
The Taihang Mountains form the western side of the triangular North China Plain. The other two sides are the Pacific coast to the east and the Yangtze River to the southwest. The vertices of this triangle are Beijing to the north, Shanghai to the southeast, and Yichang to the southwest. This alluvial plain, fed by the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers, is one of the most heavily populated regions of China. The only mountains in the plain are the Taishan in Shandong and Dabie Mountains of Anhui.

Beijing, at the north tip of the North China Plain, is shielded by the intersection of the Taihang and Yan Mountains. Further north are the drier grasslands of the Inner Mongolian Plateau, traditionally home to pastoralists. To the south are agricultural regions, traditionally home to sedentary populations. The Great Wall of China was built across the mountains that mark the southern edge of the Inner Mongolian Plateau. The Ming-era walls run over east to west from Shanhaiguan on the Bohai coast to the Hexi Corridor in Gansu.

; South (hills)

East of the Tibetan Plateau, deeply folded mountains fan out toward the Sichuan Basin, which is ringed by mountains with 1,000–3,000 m elevation. The floor of the basin has an average elevation of 500 m and is home to one of the most densely farmed and populated regions of China. The Sichuan Basin is capped in the north by the eastward continuation of the Kunlun range, the Qinling, and the Dabashan. The Qinling and Dabashan ranges form a major north-south divide across China Proper, the traditional core area of China. Southeast of the Tibetan Plateau and south of the Sichuan Basin is the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, which occupies much of southwest China. This plateau, with an average elevation of 2,000 m, is known for its limestone karst landscape.

South of the Yangtze, the landscape is more rugged. Like Shanxi Province to the north, Hunan and Jiangxi each have a provincial core in a river basin that is surrounded by mountains. The Wuling range separates Guizhou from Hunan. The Luoxiao and Jinggang divide Hunan from Jiangxi, which is separated from Fujian by the Wuyi Mountains. The southeast coastal provinces, Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong, have rugged coasts, with pockets of lowland and mountainous interior. The Nanling, an east–west mountain range across northern Guangdong, seals off Hunan and Jiangxi from Guangdong.

===Xinjiang-Mongolia===

Northwest of the Tibetan Plateau, between the northern slope of Kunlun and southern slope of Tian Shan, is the vast Tarim Basin of Xinjiang, which contains the Taklamakan Desert. The Tarim Basin, the largest in China, measures from east to west and from north to south at its widest parts. Average elevation in the basin is 1,000 m. To the east, the basin descends into the Hami-Turpan Depression of eastern Xinjiang, where the dried lake bed of Lake Ayding, at −154m below sea level, is the lowest surface point in China and the third-lowest in the world. With temperatures that have reached 49.6 C., the lake bed ranks as one of the hottest places in China. North of Tian Shan is Xinjiang&#x27;s second great basin, the Junggar, which contains the Gurbantünggüt Desert. The Junggar Basin is enclosed to the north by the Altay Mountains, which separate Xinjiang from Russia and Mongolia.

Northeast of the Tibetan Plateau, the Altun Shan-Qilian Mountains range branches off the Kunlun and creates a parallel mountain range running east–west. In between in northern Qinghai is the Qaidam Basin, with elevations of 2,600–3,000 m and numerous brackish and salt lakes. North of the Qilian is Hexi Corridor of Gansu, a natural passage between Xinjiang and China Proper that was part of the ancient Silk Road and traversed by modern highway and rail lines to Xinjiang. Further north, the Inner Mongolian Plateau, between 900 and 1,500 m in elevation, arcs north up the spine of China and becomes the Greater Hinggan Range of Northeast China.

Between the Qinling and the Inner Mongolian Plateau is Loess Plateau, the largest of its kind in the world, covering in Shaanxi, parts of Gansu and Shanxi provinces, and some of Ningxia-Hui Autonomous Region. The plateau is 1,000–1,500m in elevation and is filled with loess, a yellowish, loose soil that travels easily in the wind. Eroded loess silt gives the Yellow River its color and name. The Loess Plateau is bound to the east by the Luliang Mountain of Shanxi, which has a narrow basin running north to south along the Fen River. Further east are the Taihang Mountains of Hebei, the dominant topographical feature of North China.


;Highlands
The world&#x27;s tallest mountains, the Karakorum, Pamirs and Tian Shan divide China from South and Central Asia. Eleven of the seventeen tallest mountain peaks on Earth are located on China&#x27;s western borders. They include the world&#x27;s tallest peak Mount Everest (8848 m) in the Himalayas on the border with Nepal and the world&#x27;s second tallest peak, K2 (8611 m) on the border with Pakistan. From these towering heights in the west, the land descends in steps like a terrace.

North of the Himalayas and east of the Karakorum/Pamirs is the vast Tibetan Plateau. It is the largest and highest plateau in the world, and for this reason is also informally known as the &quot;Roof of the World&quot;. Its average elevation is 4000 meters above sea level. Its area is 2.5 million square kilometers which is just over a quarter of China&#x27;s total area. In the north, the plateau is hemmed in by the Kunlun Mountains, which extends eastward from the intersection of the Pamirs, Karakorum and Tian Shan.

;Tallest mountain peaks
Besides Mt. Everest and K2, the other 9 of the world&#x27;s 17 tallest peaks on China&#x27;s western borders are: Lhotse (8516 m, 4th highest), Makalu (8485 m, 5th), Cho Oyu (8188 m, 6th), Gyachung Kang (7952 m, 15th) of the Himalayas on the border with Nepal and Gasherbrum I (8080 m, 11th), Broad Peak (8051 m, 12th), Gasherbrum II (8035 m, 13th), Gasherbrum III (7946 m, 16th) and Gasherbrum IV (7932 m, 17th) of the Karakorum on the border with Pakistan. The tallest peak entirely within China is Shishapangma (8013 m, 14th) of the Tibetan Himalayas in Nyalam County of Tibet Autonomous Region. In all, 9 of the 14 mountain peaks in the world over 8,000 m are in or on the border of China. Another notable Himalayan peak in China is Namchabarwa (7782 m, 28th), near the great bend of the Yarlungtsanpo (upper Brahmaputra) River in eastern Tibet, and considered to be the eastern anchor of the Himalayas.

Outside the Himalayas and Karakorum, China&#x27;s tallest peaks are Kongur Tagh (7649 m, 37th) and Muztagh Ata (7546 m, 43rd) in the Pamirs of western Xinjiang, Gongga Shan (7556 m, 41st) in the Great Snowy Mountains of western Sichuan; and Tömür Shan (7439 m, 60th), the highest peak of Tian Shan, on the border with Kyrgyzstan.

=== Southwestern regions ===
Southwestern China is a transition between eastern plains and the high Tibetan plateau; the region is largely mountainous.

=== Rivers ===

China originally had an estimated number of 50,000 rivers. However, due to statistical discrepancies, water and soil loss, and climate change, there are currently only an estimated 22,000 rivers remaining. The rivers in China have a total length of 420,000 kilometers. 1,500 have a catchment area exceeding 1,000 square kilometers. The majority of rivers flow west to east into the Pacific Ocean. The Yangtze (Chang Jiang) rises in Tibet, flows through Central China and enters the East China Sea near Shanghai. The Yangtze is 6,300 kilometers long and has a catchment area of 1.8 million square kilometers. It is the third longest river in the world, after the Amazon and the Nile. The second longest river in China is the Huang He (Yellow River). It rises in Tibet and travels circuitously for 5,464 kilometers through North China, it empties into the Bo Hai Gulf on the north coast of the Shandong Province. It has a catchment area of 752,000 square kilometers. The Heilongjiang (Heilong or Black Dragon River) flows for 3,101 kilometers in Northeast China and an additional 1,249 kilometers in Russia, where it is known as the Amur. The longest river in South China is the Zhujiang (Pearl River), which is 2,214 kilometers long. Along with its three tributaries, the Xi (West), Dong (East), and Bei (North) rivers, it forms the Pearl River Delta near Guangzhou, Zhuhai, Macau, and Hong Kong. Other major rivers are the Liaohe in the northeast, Haihe in the north, Qiantang in the east, and Lancang in the southwest.
Inland drainage involving upland basins in the north and northeast accounts for 40 percent of the country&#x27;s total drainage area. Many rivers and streams flow into lakes or diminish in the desert. Some are used for irrigation.

China&#x27;s territorial waters are principally marginal seas of the western Pacific Ocean. These waters lie on the indented coastline of the mainland and approximately 5,000 islands. The Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea are marginal seas of the Pacific Ocean. More than half the coastline, predominantly in the south, is rocky; most of the remainder is sandy. The Bay of Hangzhou roughly divides the two kinds of shoreline.

; Northern plain
There is a steep drop in the river level in the North China Plain, where the river continues across the delta, it transports a heavy load of sand and mud which is deposited on the flat plain. The flow is aided by manmade embankments. As a result, the river flows on a raised ridge fifty meters above the plain. Waterlogging, floods, and course changes have recurred over the centuries. Traditionally, rulers were judged by their concern for or indifference to preservation of the embankments. In the modern era, China has undertaken extensive flood control and conservation measures.

Flowing from its source in the Qingzang highlands, the Yellow River courses toward the sea through the North China Plain, the historic center of Chinese expansion and influence. Han Chinese people have farmed the rich alluvial soils since ancient times, constructing the Grand Canal for north–south transport during the Imperial Era. The plain is a continuation of the Dongbei (Manchurian) Plain to the northeast but is separated from it by the Bohai Gulf, an extension of the Yellow Sea.

Like other densely populated areas of China, the plain is subject to floods and earthquakes. The mining and industrial center of Tangshan, east of Beijing, was leveled by an earthquake in July 1976, it was believed to be the largest earthquake of the 20th century by death toll.

The Hai River, like the Yangtze River, flows from west to east. Its upper course consists of five rivers that converge near Tianjin, then flow seventy kilometers before emptying into the Bohai Gulf. The Huai River, rises in Henan Province and flows through several lakes before joining the Yangtze River near Yangzhou.

; East and Yangtze
The Qin Mountains, a continuation of the Kunlun Mountains, divides the North China Plain from the Yangtze River Delta and is the major physiographic boundary between the two great parts of China Proper. It is a cultural boundary as it influences the distribution of customs and language. South of the Qinling mountain range divide are the densely populated and highly developed areas of the lower and middle plains of the Yangtze River and, on its upper reaches, the Sichuan Basin, an area encircled by a high barrier of mountain ranges.

The country&#x27;s longest and most important waterway, the Yangtze River, is navigable for the majority of its length and has a vast hydroelectric potential. Rising on the Qingzang Plateau, the Yangtze River traverses through the heart of the country, draining an area of before emptying into the East China Sea. Roughly 300 million people live along its middle and lower reaches. The area is a large producer of rice and wheat. The Sichuan Basin, due to its mild, humid climate and long growing season, produces a variety of crops. It is a leading silk-producing area and an important industrial region with substantial mineral resources.

The Nanling Mountains, the southernmost of the east–west mountain ranges, overlook areas in China with a tropical climate. The climate allows two crops of rice to be grown per year. Southeast of the mountains lies a coastal, hilly region of small deltas and narrow valley plains. The drainage area of the Pearl River and its associated network of rivers occupies much of the region to the south. West of the Nanling, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau rises in two steps, averaging 1,200 and 1,800 m in elevation, respectively, toward the precipitous mountain regions of the eastern Qingzang Plateau.

=== Geology and natural resources ===

China has substantial mineral reserves and is the world&#x27;s largest producer of antimony, natural graphite, tungsten, and zinc. Other major minerals are aluminum, bauxite, coal, crude petroleum, diamonds, gold, iron ore, lead, magnetite, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, natural gas, phosphate rock, tin, uranium, and vanadium. China&#x27;s hydropower potential is the largest in the world.

===Land use===

Based on 2005 estimates, 14.86% (about ) of China&#x27;s total land area is arable. About 1.3% (some 116,580 km2) is planted to permanent crops and the rest planted to temporary crops. With comparatively little land planted to permanent crops, intensive agricultural techniques are used to reap harvests that are sufficient to feed the world&#x27;s largest population and still have surplus for export. An estimated 544,784 km2 of land were irrigated in 2004. 42.9% of total land area was used as pasture, and 17.5% was forest.
===Deserts===
Nearly 20 percent of China (about 1,900,000 km2) is desert:

# Gobi Desert and Hami Desert - 1,295,000 km2 (with Mongolia)
# Dzungaria - 777,000 km2 
# Taklamakan Desert - 337,000 km2
# Ordos Desert - 215,952 km2
# Lop Desert - 50,000 km2
# Gurbantünggüt Desert - 50,000 km2
# Mu Us Desert - 48,288 km2
# Badain Jaran Desert - 49,000 km2
# Tengger Desert - 36,700 km2
# Kubuqi Desert - 18,600 km2
# Shapotou, Zhongwei - 5,380 km2
# Kumtag Desert - 2,600 km2

===Wildlife===

China lies in two of the world&#x27;s major ecozones, the Palearctic and the Indomalaya. In the Palearctic zone mammals such as the horse, camel, and jerboa are found. Among the species found in the Indomalaya region are the leopard cat, bamboo rat, treeshrew, and various other species of monkeys and apes. Some overlap exists between the two regions because of natural dispersal and migration, and deer or antelope, bears, wolves, pigs, and rodents are found in all of the diverse climatic and geological environments. The famous giant panda is found only in a limited area along the Yangtze. There is a continuing problem with trade in endangered species, although there are now laws to prohibit such activities.

==Human geography==

=== History ===

Chinese history is often explained in terms of several strategic areas, defined by particular topographic limits. Starting from the Chinese central plain, the former heart of the Han populations, the Han people expanded militarily and then demographically toward the Loess Plateau, the Sichuan Basin, and the Southern Hills (as defined by the map on the left), not without resistance from local populations. Pushed by its comparatively higher demographic growth, the Han continued their expansion by military and demographic waves. The far-south of present-day China, the northern parts of today&#x27;s Vietnam, and the Tarim Basin were first reached and durably subdued by the Han dynasty&#x27;s armies. The Northern steppes were always the source of invasions into China, which culminated in the 13th century by Mongolian conquest of the whole China and creation of Mongolian Yuan dynasty. Manchuria, much of today&#x27;s Northeast China, and Korean Peninsula were usually not under Chinese control, with the exception of some limited periods of occupation. Manchuria became strongly integrated into the Chinese empire during the late Qing dynasty, while the west side of the Changbai Mountains, formerly the home of Korean tribes, thus also entered China.

=== Demographic geography ===

The demographic occupation follows the topography and availability of former arable lands. The Heihe–Tengchong Line, running from Heihe, Heilongjiang to Tengchong County, Yunnan divides China into two roughly equal sections–in terms of geographic area, with areas west of the line being sparsely settled and areas east densely populated, in general. Today there are 5 major religions that have been recognized by the state; Buddhism, Taoism, Protestantism, Catholicism, and Islam. Buddhism and folk religions account for roughly 21% of the population while Protestants make up 5% and Islam 1.6% of the population. A substantial number of Buddhists live in the southwestern Tibetan region of the country which borders Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan and most notably India, the birthplace of Buddhism. The Islamic population, consisting mostly of Hui and Uighur Muslims, is concentrated in the northwestern Xinjiang region of the country which shares borders with Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Russia.

=== Administrative geography ===
Chinese administrative geography was drawn mainly during the 1949 and 1954 administrative reorganizations. These reorganizations have been the source of much debate within China. In addition, a parcel of land was ceded from Guangdong to Guangxi to grant the latter immediate access to the Gulf of Tonkin, while Hainan was split from Guangdong in 1988 and Chongqing from Sichuan in 1997.
=== Agriculture ===
As the country continues to industrialize, the share of agriculture as a part of China&#x27;s GDP has lowered to 11% in recent years. Of the enormous labor force in China, 27.7% work in agriculture. China&#x27;s primary agricultural import is wheat from Argentina, Australia, Canada, and France. They import about four to five million metric tons of wheat per year and they are able to buy the wheat for about $700 per ton, making wheat China&#x27;s most important agricultural import. On the other hand, China&#x27;s most important agricultural export is rice. China exports about 750,000 metric tons of rice per year for about $1200 per ton. Other significant agricultural exports from China are potatoes, corn, tobacco, peanuts, tea, apples, cotton, pork, mutton, eggs, fish, and shrimp.

According to the World Bank, as of 2015, China&#x27;s total arable land was estimated at 119,000,000 hectares. Since 2005, arable land in China has been on the decline and the total arable land per citizen has reached .2 acres. As a percentage, agricultural land makes up about 54.7% of land. The climate of the country is difficult to describe because it varies so much depending on the region of China. The southernmost parts of the country are almost tropical, while the northernmost part is subarctic.

=== Territory and boundary disputes ===
The territory of China has been defined as a homeland for many different ethnic and racial groups in the country. However, the way that the territory has been defined varies between ethnic groups. In relation to the Han Chinese, the homeland has been defined by national borders which are more or less accepted internationally. This is because the Han Chinese are the largest population and have most influence politically than any other ethnic population in China. To the Han Chinese population, the territory of the country is defined by the regions of Tibet, inner Mongolia, Manchuria, and the Xinjiang Province which is the most western land of China. The Chinese territory is the second largest in land area and also has the longest combined land border in the world. However, there are many other ethnic groups in China that have their own definitions of what concerns the territory of China.

One group of people in China are the Tibetans. Tibetans and the land of Tibet are considered by the Han Chinese government to be part of China and that the territory of Tibet is also part of the country. However, many Tibetans disagree and are protesting as well as rallying for freedom in present day. To this ethnic population, the territory of Tibet is not considered part of China and so is not defined as a Chinese territory. However, the Chinese government still consider Tibet as a territory of China which reflects the dispute in definition of Chinese territory between two ethnic groups.

Another group of people which have a dispute in definition of territory are the Taiwanese. The Taiwanese people inhabit the island of Taiwan and are markedly politically different as the people of Taiwan have a free market capitalist based economy while the mainland Chinese government employ a communistic state run economy. There are disputes in the definition of territory between Taiwan and China as the Chinese government claims ownership over Taiwan while some Taiwanese people maintain that they are a sovereign state completely independent from the mainland Chinese government. These disputes have led to international controversy as many countries such as the United States of America have not officially recognized the sovereignty of Taiwan.

====Central Asia====
China&#x27;s borders have more than of land frontier shared with nearly all the nations of mainland East Asia, and have been disputed at a number of points. In the western sector, China claimed portions of the Pamir Mountains area, a region of soaring mountain peaks and glacier-filled valleys where the borders of Afghanistan, Pakistan, the former Soviet Union, and China meet in Central Asia. North and east of this region, some sections of the border remained undemarcated in 1987. The frontier with the Soviet Union has been a source of continual friction. In 1954 China published maps showing substantial portions of Soviet Siberian territory as its own. In the northeast, border friction with the Soviet Union produced a tense situation in remote regions of Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang along segments of the Argun River, Amur River, and Ussuri River. Each side had massed troops and had exchanged charges of border provocation in this area. In a September 1986 speech in Vladivostok, the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev offered the Chinese a more conciliatory position on Sino-Soviet border issues. In 1987 the two sides resumed border talks that had been broken off after the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (see Sino-Soviet relations). Although the border issue remained unresolved as of late 1987, China and the Soviet Union agreed to consider the northeastern sector first. In October 2004, China signed an agreement with Russia on the delimitation of their entire -long border, which had long been in dispute.

====Southern border====
Eastward from Bhutan and north of the Brahmaputra River (Yarlung Zangbo Jiang) lies a large area controlled and administered by India but claimed by the Chinese. The area was demarcated by the British McMahon Line, drawn along the Himalayas in 1914 as the Sino-Indian border; India accepts and China rejects this boundary. In June 1980 China made its first move in twenty years to settle the border disputes with India, proposing that India cede the Aksai Chin area in Jammu and Kashmir to China in return for China&#x27;s recognition of the McMahon Line; India did not accept the offer, however, preferring a sector-by-sector approach to the problem. In July 1986 China and India held their seventh round of border talks, but they made little headway toward resolving the dispute. Each side, but primarily India, continued to make allegations of incursions into its territory by the other. Most of the mountainous and militarized boundary with India is still in dispute, but Beijing and New Delhi have committed to begin resolution with discussions on the least disputed middle sector. India does not recognize Pakistan&#x27;s ceding lands to China in a 1964 boundary agreement.

The China-Burma border issue was settled 1 October 1960, by the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. The first joint inspection of the border was completed successfully in June 1986.

India: On 15 May 2015, Mr. Li from China and Mr. Modi from India held talks at the Great Hall of the people during Modi&#x27;s China tour. The two leaders held talks on border disputes that began in 1914 when the British still controlled India and signed an agreement with Tibet to make the McMahon line the de facto boundary between India and China, even though China had rejected this agreement. Both countries had various claims to disputed territories such as the South Tibetan region of Zangnan which is considered to be part of the Arunachal Pradesh state in India. So far there have been only talks and no solutions and tensions continue to rise as each country continues to increase regional influences.

====Seas====
China is involved in a complex dispute with Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, and possibly Brunei over the Spratly (Nansha) Islands in the South China Sea. The 2002 &quot;Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea&quot; eased tensions but fell short of a legally binding code of conduct desired by several of the disputants. China also controls the Paracel (Xisha) Islands, which are also claimed by Vietnam, and asserts a claim to the Japanese-administered Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands in the East China Sea.

South China Sea: On 16 June 2011, the Chinese government sent out one of its largest patrol ships known as the Haixun-31 which the Chinese government describe as routine. The ship will pass the Paracel and Spratly Islands and make its way up from the Malaysian to Filipino coast. Vietnam, China, the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei and Malaysia all have competing claims to the Spratlys Islands while Beijing and Hanoi are in dispute over the Paracel islands. Hanoi has proposed a multilateral solution between the Asian countries but China says that it prefers to negotiate with individual states separately.

==== Border security ====
The security and strength of the Chinese borders vary depending on the location of the section of the border in question. This is due to the nature of the borders as well as the physical geography of the country. China has a large territory, about the same size as the United States, but the actual distribution of population is highly disproportionate. Sixty percent of the population live on the east coast of China which is only 22 percent of its territory while the other 78 percent lying inland is sparsely populated with ethnic minorities such as Tibetans, Kazakhs, Uyghurs, and other Chinese Muslim groups. Many of these groups have little to no loyalty to the central government of China further adding to the strained security of China&#x27;s borders. The regions of Xinjiang and Tibet in particular harbor strong separatist movements.

China signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with the Soviet Union in 1950. In the wake of the Sino-Soviet split during the 1960s, the Sino-Soviet border became highly militarized: at one point over 1.5 million nuclear-armed troops were installed along both sides of the border. Relations improved in the mid-1980s due to the decrease in threat to the Chinese government from the USSR. On 13 January 2011, the parliament of Tajikistan voted to ratify a 1999 deal to cede of land in the remote Pamir Mountain range, which thoroughly resolved a century-long border dispute with China. China is the largest investor in the Tajik economy especially in the energy and infrastructure sectors.

== Climate and environment ==

=== Climate ===
Owing to tremendous differences in latitude, longitude, and altitude, the climate of China is extremely diverse, ranging from tropical in the far south to subarctic in the far north and alpine in the higher elevations of the Tibetan Plateau. Monsoon winds, caused by differences in the heat-absorbing capacity of the continent and the ocean, dominate the climate. During the summer, the East Asian Monsoon carries warm and moist air from the south and delivers the vast majority of the annual precipitation in much of the country. Conversely, the Siberian anticyclone dominates during winter, bringing cold and comparatively dry conditions. The advance and retreat of the monsoons account in large degree for the timing of the rainy season throughout the country. Although most of the country lies in the temperate belt, its climatic patterns are complex.

The northern extremities of both Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia have a subarctic climate; in contrast, most of Hainan Island and parts of the extreme southern fringes of Yunnan have a tropical climate. Temperature differences in winter are considerable, but in summer the variance is considerably less. For example, Mohe County, Heilongjiang has a 24-hour average temperature in January approaching , while the corresponding figure in July exceeds . By contrast, most of Hainan has a January mean in excess of , while the July mean there is generally above .

Precipitation is almost invariably concentrated in the warmer months, though annual totals range from less than in northwestern Qinghai and the Turpan Depression of Xinjiang to easily exceeding in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan. Only in some pockets of the Dzungaria region of Xinjiang is the conspicuous seasonal variation in precipitation that defines Chinese (and, to a large extent, East Asian) climate absent.

Annual sunshine duration ranges from less than 1,100 hours in parts of Sichuan and Chongqing to over 3,400 hours in northwestern Qinghai. Seasonal patterns in sunshine vary considerably by region, but overall, the north and the Tibetan Plateau are sunnier than the south of the country.

=== Environment ===

Air pollution (sulfur dioxide particulates) from reliance on coal is a major issue, along with water pollution from untreated wastes and use of debated standards of pollutant concentration rather than Total Maximum Daily Load. There are water shortages, particularly in the north. The eastern part of China often experiences smoke and dense fog in the atmosphere as a result of industrial pollution. Heavy deforestation with an estimated loss of one-fifth of agricultural land since 1949 to soil erosion and economic development is occurring with resulting desertification.

China is a party to the Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, the Antarctic Treaty, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Climate Change treaty, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, the Endangered Species treaty, the Hazardous Wastes treaty, the Law of the Sea, the International Tropical Timber Agreements of 1983 and 1994, the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, and agreements on Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, and Wetlands protection. China has signed, but not ratified, the Kyoto Protocol (but is not yet required to reduce its carbon emission under the agreement, as is India) and the Nuclear Test Ban treaty.

<text>The People&#x27;s Republic of China is the second most-populous country in the world and Asia with a population exceeding 1.4 billion, only surpassed by India. Historically, China has always been one of the nation-states with the most population. Experts say China will shrink to half of its population from 1.4 billion in present-day to just 872 million by the late 21st century.

China has an enormous population with a relatively small youth component, partially a result of China&#x27;s one-child policy that was implemented from 1979 until 2015, which limited urban families to one offspring and rural families to two. , Chinese state media reported the country&#x27;s total fertility rate to be 1.09.

China was the world&#x27;s most populous country from at least 1950 until being surpassed by India in 2023.

By one estimate, in 2024 China&#x27;s population stood at about 1.408 billion, down from the 1.412 billion recorded in the 2020 census. According to the 2020 census, 91.11% of the population was Han Chinese, and 8.89% were minorities. China&#x27;s population growth rate is −0.15%, ranking 159th in the world. China conducted its sixth national population census in 2010, and its seventh census was completed in late 2020, with data released in May 2021.

China faces the challenge of an aging population due to increased life expectancy and declining birth rates. This demographic shift has implications for social services and the labor force.

==Population==
===Historical population===

During 1960–2015, the population grew to nearly 1.4 billion. Under Mao Zedong, China nearly doubled in population from 540 million in 1949 to 969 million in 1979. This growth slowed because of the one-child policy instituted in 1979. The 2022 data shows a declining population for the first time since 1961.

China&#x27;s population reached 1 billion in 1982, making it the first country to reach this milestone.

===Censuses in China===

The People&#x27;s Republic of China conducted censuses in 1953, 1964, 1982, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020. In 1987, the government announced that the fourth national census would take place in 1990 and that there would be one every ten years thereafter. The 1982 census (which reported a total population of 1,008,180,738) is generally accepted as significantly more reliable, accurate, and thorough than the previous two. Various international organizations eagerly assisted the Chinese in conducting the 1982 census, including the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, which donated US$100.0 million between 1980 and 1989 for a variety of projects, one of which being the 1982 census.

China was the world&#x27;s most populous nation until being surpassed by India in 2023.

By the sixth census in 2020, the total population had reached to 1,419,933,142, with the mainland having 1,411,778,724, Hong Kong having 7,474,200, and Macau having 683,218. However, this number is disputed by obstetrics researcher Yi Fuxian, who argues that data related to population growth is inflated by local governments to obtain financial subsidies from the central government.

===Population density and distribution===

China is the second most populous country in the world and its national population density (137/km2) is very similar to those of countries like Denmark (excluding Greenland) or the Czech Republic. However, the overall population density of China conceals major regional variations. In 2002, about 94% of the population lived east of the Heihe–Tengchong Line; although this eastern area comprises only 43% of China&#x27;s total land area, its population density, at roughly 280/km2, is comparable to that of Japan.

Broadly speaking, the population was concentrated east of the Tibetan Plateau and south of the northern steppe. The most densely populated areas included the Yangtze River Valley (of which the delta region was the most populous), Sichuan Basin, North China Plain, Pearl River Delta, and the industrial area around the city of Shenyang in the northeast.

Population is most sparse in the mountainous, desert, and grassland regions of the northwest and southwest. In Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, portions are completely uninhabited, and only a few sections have populations denser than ten people per km2. The Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet autonomous regions and Qinghai and Gansu comprise 55% of the country&#x27;s land area but in 1985 contained only 5.7% of its population.

===Structure of the population===
Census population of China by age and sex:

Population by Sex and Age Group (as of November 01, 2010). For statistical purposes, the data for China do not include those for Hong Kong and Macau. Data exclude 2.3 million servicemen, 4.65 million persons with permanent resident status difficult to define, and 0.12 per cent undercount based on the post enumeration survey:

===Urbanization===

Urbanization increased in speed following the initiation of the reform and opening policy. By the end of 2024, 67% of the total population lived in urban areas, a rate that rose from 26% in 1990.

==Population control==

Initially, China&#x27;s post-1949 leaders were ideologically disposed to view a large population as an asset. But the liabilities of a large, rapidly growing population soon became apparent. For one year, starting in August 1956, vigorous support was given to the Ministry of Public Health&#x27;s mass birth control efforts. These efforts, however, had little impact on fertility. After the interval of the Great Leap Forward, Chinese leaders again saw rapid population growth as an obstacle to development, and their interest in birth control revived. In the early 1960s, schemes somewhat more muted than during the first campaign, emphasized the virtues of late marriage. Birth control offices were set up in the central government and some provincial-level governments in 1964. The second campaign was particularly successful in the cities, where the birth rate was cut in half during the 1963–66 period. The upheaval of the Cultural Revolution brought the program to a halt, however.

In 1972 and 1973 the party mobilized its resources for a nationwide birth control campaign administered by a group in the State Council. Committees to oversee birth control activities were established at all administrative levels and in various collective enterprises. This extensive and seemingly effective network covered both the rural and the urban population. In urban areas public security headquarters included population control sections. In rural areas the country&#x27;s &quot;barefoot doctors&quot; distributed information and contraceptives to people&#x27;s commune members. By 1973 Mao Zedong was personally identified with the family planning movement, signifying a greater leadership commitment to controlled population growth than ever before. Yet until several years after Mao&#x27;s death in 1976, the leadership was reluctant to put forth directly the rationale that population control was necessary for economic growth and improved living standards.

Population growth targets were set for both administrative units and individual families. In the mid-1970s the maximum recommended family size was two children in cities and three or four in the country. In 1979 the government began advocating a one-child limit for both rural and urban areas and has generally set a maximum of two children in special circumstances. As of 1986 the policy for minority nationalities was two children per couple, three in special circumstances, and no limit for ethnic groups with very small populations. The overall goal of the one-child policy was to keep the total population within 1.2 billion through the year 2000, on the premise that the Four Modernizations program would be of little value if population growth was not brought under control.

Under the one-child program, a sophisticated system rewarded those who observed the policy and penalized those who did not. Through this policy, the rate of increasing population was tempered after the penalties were made. Couples with only one child were given a &quot;one-child certificate&quot; entitling them to such benefits as cash bonuses, longer maternity leave, better child care, and preferential housing assignments. In return, they were required to pledge that they would not have more children. In the countryside, there was great pressure to adhere to the one-child limit. Because the rural population accounted for approximately 60% of the total, the effectiveness of the one-child policy in rural areas was considered the key to the success or failure of the program as a whole.

In rural areas the day-to-day work of family planning was done by cadres at the team and brigade levels who were responsible for women&#x27;s affairs and by health workers. The women&#x27;s team leader made regular household visits to keep track of the status of each family under her jurisdiction and collected information on which women were using contraceptives, the methods used, and which had become pregnant. She then reported to the brigade women&#x27;s leader, who documented the information and took it to a monthly meeting of the commune birth-planning committee. According to reports, ceilings or quotas had to be adhered to; to satisfy these cutoffs, unmarried young people were persuaded to postpone marriage, couples without children were advised to &quot;wait their turn,&quot; women with unauthorized pregnancies were pressured to have abortions, and those who already had children were urged to use contraception or undergo sterilization. Couples with more than one child were exhorted to be sterilized.

The one-child policy enjoyed much greater success in urban than in rural areas. Even without state intervention, there were compelling reasons for urban couples to limit the family to a single child. Raising a child required a significant portion of family income, and in the cities a child did not become an economic asset until he or she entered the work force at age sixteen. Couples with only one child were given preferential treatment in housing allocation. In addition, because city dwellers who were employed in state enterprises received pensions after retirement, the sex of their first child was less important to them than it was to those in rural areas.

Numerous reports surfaced of coercive measures used to achieve the desired results of the one-child policy. The alleged methods ranged from intense psychological pressure to the use of physical force, including some grisly accounts of forced abortions and infanticide. Chinese officials admitted that isolated, uncondoned abuses of the program occurred and that they condemned such acts, but they insisted that the family planning program was administered on a voluntary basis using persuasion and economic measures only. International reaction to the allegations were mixed. The UN Fund for Population Activities and the International Planned Parenthood Federation were generally supportive of China&#x27;s family planning program. The United States Agency for International Development, however, withdrew US$10 million from the Fund in March 1985 based on allegations that coercion had been used.

Observers suggested that an accurate assessment of the one-child program would not be possible until all women who came of childbearing age in the early 1980s passed their fertile years. As of 1987 the one-child program had achieved mixed results. In general, it was very successful in almost all urban areas but less successful in rural areas.

Rapid fertility reduction associated with the one-child policy has potentially negative results. For instance, in the future the elderly might not be able to rely on their children to care for them as they have in the past, leaving the state to assume the expense, which could be considerable. Based on United Nations and Chinese government statistics, it was estimated in 1987 that by 2000 the population 60 years and older (the retirement age is 60 in urban areas) would number 127 million, or 10.1% of the total population; the projection for 2025 was 234 million elderly, or 16.4%. According to projections based on the 1982 census, if the one-child policy were maintained to the year 2000, 25% of China&#x27;s population would be age 65 or older by 2040. In 2050, the number of people over 60 is expected to increase to 430 million. Even though China has already opened two-child policy since 2016, data shows that the second-child policy cannot stop the problem of an aging population. China needs to find an appropriate birth policy to optimize the demographic dividend, which refers to the proportion of labor-age population. On the other hand, the higher house prices squeeze the marriage in China. The house price plays an important role on the influence of marriage and fertility. The increasing house price leads to the lower marriage rate and cause the other serious social problems in China.

In 2024, United Nations researchers forecast China&#x27;s population to fall to 639 million by 2100. The same year, researchers from Victoria University and the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences forecast that China&#x27;s population will fall to approximately 525 million by 2100 at current rates. This revision, reducing the population estimate to 525 million from a previous forecast of 597 million by 2100, indicates a sharper decline than previously anticipated.

===Total fertility rate by region===
According to the 2000 census, the TFR was 1.22 (0.86 for cities, 1.08 for towns and 1.43 for villages/outposts). Beijing had the lowest TFR at 0.67, while Guizhou had the highest at 2.19. The Xiangyang district of Jiamusi city (Heilongjiang) has a TFR of 0.41, which is the lowest TFR recorded anywhere in the world in recorded history. Other extremely low TFR counties are: 0.43 in the Heping district of Tianjin city (Tianjin), and 0.46 in the Mawei district of Fuzhou city (Fujian). At the other end TFR was 3.96 in Geji County (Tibet), 4.07 in Jiali County (Tibet), and 5.47 in Baqing County (Tibet).

The 2010 census reported a TFR of 1.18 (0.88 in cities, 1.15 in townships, and
1.44 in rural areas).
The five regions with the lowest fertility rates were Beijing (0.71), Shanghai
(0.74), Liaoning (0.74), Heilongjiang (0.75), and Jilin (0.76). The five regions with the highest
fertility rates were Guangxi (1.79), Guizhou (1.75), Xinjiang (1.53), Hainan (1.51), and Anhui
(1.48).

The 2020 census reported a TFR of 1.301, with 1.118 in cities, 1.395 in townships, and 1.543 in rural areas. 
The shift of fertility rate recorded in 2020 census compared to that in the previous 2 censuses may not be an actual recovery, but rather due to the low quality and massive underreporting of lower-age groups in the 2000 and 2010 censuses, while the population control policy in China back then may also give families an incentive to hide their children, which is largely relieved as the policy changed in 2010s. This can be demonstrated by the much lower number of population aged 0~4 and 5~9 in the 2000 and 2010 censuses when compared to the corresponding age groups in 2020.

Total fertility rate by ethnic group (2010 census): Han (1.14), Zhuang (1.59), Hui (1.48), Manchu (1.18), Uyghur (2.04), Miao (1.82), Yi (1.82), Tujia (1.74), Tibetan (1.60), Mongols (1.26).
===Life expectancy===


Source: &quot;UN World Population Prospects&quot;

===Fertility and mortality===
In 1949 crude death rates were probably higher than 30 per 1,000, and the average life expectancy was only 35 years. Beginning in the early 1950s, mortality steadily declined; it continued to decline through 1978 and remained relatively constant through 1987. One major fluctuation was reported in a computer reconstruction of China&#x27;s population trends from 1953 to 1987 produced by the United States Bureau of the Census. The computer model showed that the crude death rate increased dramatically during the famine years associated with the Great Leap Forward (1958–60).

According to Chinese government statistics, the crude birth rate followed five distinct patterns from 1949 to 1982. It remained stable from 1949 to 1954, varied widely from 1955 to 1965, experienced fluctuations between 1966 and 1969, dropped sharply in the late 1970s, and increased from 1980 to 1981. Between 1970 and 1980, the crude birth rate dropped from 33.4 per 1,000 to 18.2 per 1,000. The government attributed this dramatic decline in fertility to the &quot;wǎn xī shǎo&quot; (&quot;晚、稀、少&quot;, or &quot;late, long, few&quot;: later marriages, longer intervals between births, and fewer children) birth control campaign. However, elements of socioeconomic change, such as increased employment of women in both urban and rural areas and reduced infant mortality (a greater percentage of surviving children would tend to reduce demand for additional children), may have played some role. The birth rate increased in the 1980s to a level over 20 per 1,000, primarily as a result of a marked rise in marriages and first births. The rise was an indication of problems with the one-child policy of 1979. Chinese sources, however, indicate that the birth rate started to decrease again in the 1990s and reached a level of around 12 per 1,000 in recent years.

In urban areas, the housing shortage may have been at least partly responsible for the decreased birth rate. Also, the policy in force during most of the 1960s and the early 1970s of sending large numbers of high school graduates to the countryside deprived cities of a significant proportion of persons of childbearing age and undoubtedly had some effect on birth rates (see Cultural Revolution (1966–76)). Primarily for economic reasons, rural birth rates tended to decline less than urban rates. The right to grow and sell agricultural products for personal profit and the lack of an old-age welfare system were incentives for rural people to produce many children, especially sons, for help in the fields and for support in old age. Because of these conditions, it is unclear to what degree education has been able to erode traditional values favoring large families.

China exhibits a serious gender imbalance. Census data obtained in 2000 revealed that 119 boys were born for every 100 girls, and among China&#x27;s &quot;floating population&quot; the ratio was as high as 128:100. These situations led the government in July 2004 to ban selective abortions of female fetuses. It is estimated that this imbalance will rise until 2025–2030 to reach 20% then slowly decrease.

In the 2020s, cash incentives have been offered to increase birth rates. Local government family-planning committees, previously used to enforce the one-child policy, are deployed for pro-natalist policies such as calling women to check on their menstrual cycle.

==== Censorship of data ====
Although the National Bureau of Statistics of China reported 9.02 million births in 2023, the state-owned &quot;Mother and Infant Daily&quot; newspaper reported there were 7.88 million births for the same year. The report was promptly censored following publication.

===Labor force===
In 2012, for the first time, according to the National Bureau of Statistics in January 2013, the number of people theoretically able to enter the Chinese labor force (individuals aged 15 to 59), shrank slightly to 937.27 million, a decrease of 3.45 million from 2011. This trend, resulting from a demographic transition, is anticipated to continue until at least 2030.
The World Factbook estimated the 2019 active labor force was 774.71 million.

===Height and weight===
As of 2020, the average Chinese man was 169.7 centimeters tall (5 ft 7 in) in 2019, the figures showed, and women&#x27;s average height was 158 centimeters (5 ft 2.2 in). The same study showed an average Chinese man weighed 69.6 kilograms (153.4 lbs, or 11 stone 0 lbs), up 3.4 kilograms (7.5 lbs) over 10 years, while women were 1.7 kilograms (3.8 pounds) heavier on average at 59 kilograms (130.1 pounds, or 9 stone 4.1 lbs). They were up 1.2 centimeters (0.47  in) and 0.8 centimeters (0.31 in) respectively from 5 years earlier.

===Gender balance===
Future challenges for China will be the gender disparity. According to the 2020 census, males account for 51.24% of China&#x27;s 1.41 billion people, while females made up 48.76% of the total. The sex ratio (the number of males for each female in a population) at birth was 118.06 boys to every 100 girls (54.14%) in 2010, higher than the 116.86 (53.89%) of 2000, but 0.53 points lower than the ratio of 118.59 (54.25%) in 2005.

== Ethnic groups ==
The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) officially recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, the largest of which are Han, who constitute 91.51% of the total population in 2010. Ethnic minorities constitute 8.49% or 113.8 million of China&#x27;s population in 2010. During the past decades ethnic minorities have experienced higher growth rates than the majority Han population, because they are not under the one-child policy. Their proportion of the population in China has grown from 6.1% in 1953, to 8.04% in 1990, 8.41% in 2000, and 8.49% in 2010. Large ethnic minorities (data according to the 2000 census) include the Zhuang (16 million, 1.28%), Manchu (10 million, 0.84%), Uyghur (9 million, 0.78%), Hui (9 million, 0.71%), Miao (8 million, 0.71%), Yi (7 million, 0.61%), Tujia (5.75 million, 0.63%), Mongols (5 million, 0.46%), Tibetan (5 million, 0.43%), Buyei (3 million, 0.23%), and Korean (2 million, 0.15%). Over 126,000 Westerners from Canada, the US and Europe are living in mainland China. Almost 1% of people living in Hong Kong are Westerners.

Neither Hong Kong nor Macau recognizes the official ethnic classifications maintained by the central government. In Macau, the largest substantial ethnic groups of non-Chinese descent are the Macanese, of mixed Chinese and Portuguese descent (Eurasians), as well as migrants from the Philippines and Thailand. Overseas Filipinos (overwhelmingly female) working as domestic workers comprise the largest non-Han Chinese ethnic group in Hong Kong.

===People from other immigration jurisdictions===
The 2020 Census counted 371,380 residents from Hong Kong, 55,732 residents from Macau, 157,886 residents from Taiwan, and 845,697 residents from other locations, totaling 1,430,695 residents.

==Migration==

Internal migration in the People&#x27;s Republic of China is one of the most extensive in the world according to the International Labour Organization. In fact, research done by Kam Wing Chan of the University of Washington suggests that &quot;In the 30 years since 1979, China&#x27;s urban population has grown by about 440 million to 622 million in 2009. Of the 440 million increase, about 340 million was attributable to net migration and urban reclassification. Even if only half of that increase was migration, the volume of rural-urban migration in such a short period is likely the largest in human history.&quot; Migrants in China are commonly members of a floating population, which refers primarily to migrants in China without local household registration status through the Chinese Hukou system. In general, rural-urban migrant workers are most excluded from local educational resources, citywide social welfare programs and many jobs because of their lack of hukou status.

In 2011 a total of 252.78 million migrant workers (an increase of 4.4% compared to 2010) existed in China. Out of these, migrant workers who left their hometown and worked in other provinces accounted for 158.63 million (an increase of 3.4% compared to 2010) and migrant workers who worked within their home provinces reached 94.15 million (an increase of 5.9% compared to 2010). Estimations are that Chinese cities will face an influx of another 243 million migrants by 2025, taking the urban population up to nearly 1 billion people. This population of migrants would represent &quot;almost 40 percent of the total urban population,&quot; a number which is almost three times the current level. While it is often difficult to collect accurate statistical data on migrant floating populations, the number of migrants is undoubtedly quite large. &quot;In China&#x27;s largest cities, for instance, it is often quoted that at least one out of every five persons is a migrant.&quot; China&#x27;s government influences the pattern of urbanization through the Hukou permanent residence registration system, land-sale policies, infrastructure investment and the incentives offered to local government officials. The other factors influencing migration of people from rural provincial areas to large cities are employment, education, business opportunities and higher standard of living.

The mass emigration known as the Chinese diaspora, which occurred from the 19th century to 1949, was mainly caused by wars and starvation in mainland China, invasion from various foreign countries, as well as the problems resulting from political corruption. Most immigrants were illiterate peasants and manual labourers, called &quot;coolies&quot; by analogy to the same pattern of immigration from India, who emigrated to work in countries such as the Americas, Australia, South Africa and Southeast Asia.

<text>In China, politics functions within a socialist state framework based on the system of people&#x27;s congress under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), with the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) functioning as the highest organ of state power and only branch of government per the principle of unified power. The CCP leads state activities by holding two-thirds of the seats in the NPC, and these party members are, in accordance with democratic centralism, responsible for implementing the policies adopted by the CCP Central Committee and the National Congress. The NPC has unlimited state power bar the limitations it sets on itself. By controlling the NPC, the CCP has complete state power. China&#x27;s two special administrative regions (SARs), Hong Kong and Macau, are nominally autonomous from this system.

The Chinese political system is considered authoritarian. There are no freely elected national leaders, political opposition is suppressed, all religious activity is controlled by the CCP, dissent is not permitted, and civil rights are curtailed. Direct elections occur only at the local level, not the national level, with all candidate nominations controlled by the CCP.

The nature of the elections is highly constrained by the CCP&#x27;s monopoly on power in China, censorship, and party control over elections. According to academic Rory Truex of the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, &quot;the CCP tightly controls the nomination and election processes at every level in the people&#x27;s congress system... the tiered, indirect electoral mechanism in the People&#x27;s Congress system ensures that deputies at the highest levels face no semblance of electoral accountability to the Chinese citizenry.&quot;

==Overview==
Since the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, the government in Beijing officially asserts to be the sole legitimate government of all of China, which it defines as including mainland China and Taiwan. This has been disputed by the Republic of China (ROC) government since the Kuomintang (KMT) fled to Taipei in 1949. The Republic of China has since undergone significant political reforms.

China&#x27;s population, geographical vastness, and social diversity frustrate attempts to rule from Beijing. Economic reform during the 1980s and the devolution of much central government decision making, combined with the strong interest of local CCP officials in enriching themselves, has made it increasingly difficult for the central government to assert its authority.

The president of China is the head of state, serving as the ceremonial figurehead under the National People&#x27;s Congress. In March 2018, the NPC removed the term limits for the presidency. As a one-party state, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party holds ultimate power and authority over state and government. The offices of president, general secretary, and chairman of the Central Military Commission have been held simultaneously by one individual since 1993, granting the individual &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; power over the country. The position of CCP General Secretary is the highest authority leading China&#x27;s National People&#x27;s Congress, State Council, Political Consultative Conference, Supreme People&#x27;s Court and Supreme People&#x27;s Procuratorate.

Central government leaders must, in practice, build consensus for new policies among party members, local and regional leaders, influential non-party members, and the population at large. Even as there have been some moves in the direction of democratization as far as the electoral system at least, in that openly contested People&#x27;s Congress elections are now held at the village and town levels, and that legislatures have shown some assertiveness from time to time, the CCP retains effective control over governmental appointments. This is because the CCP wins by default in most electorates.

The social, cultural, and political as well as economic consequences of market reform have created tensions in Chinese society.

==Self-description==
The Chinese constitution describes China&#x27;s system of government as a people&#x27;s democratic dictatorship. The CCP has also used other terms to officially describe China&#x27;s system of government including &quot;socialist consultative democracy&quot;, and whole-process people&#x27;s democracy. According to the CCP theoretical journal &quot;Qiushi&quot;, &quot;[c]onsultative democracy was created by the CPC and the Chinese people as a form of socialist democracy. ... Not only representing a commitment to socialism, it carries forward China&#x27;s political and cultural traditions. Not only representing a commitment to the organizational principles and leadership mode of democratic centralism, it also affirms the role of the general public in a democracy. Not only representing a commitment to the leadership of the CPC, it also gives play to the role of all political parties and organizations as well as people of all ethnic groups and all sectors of society&quot;. The semi-official journal &quot;China Today&quot; stated the CCP&#x27;s view: &quot;Consultative democracy guarantees widespread and effective participation in politics through consultations carried out by political parties, peoples congresses, government departments, CPPCC committees, peoples organizations, communities, and social organizations&quot;. On the other hand, according to the V-Dem Democracy indices China was 2023 the second least electoral democratic country in Asia.

==Communist Party==
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) dominates the Chinese political landscape. Constitutionally, the party&#x27;s highest body is the Party Congress, which meets every five years. Meetings were irregular before the Cultural Revolution but have been periodic since then. The National Congress elects the Central Committee and the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI); the Central Committee in turn elects bodies such as:

*The General Secretary, which is the highest-ranking official within the Party and usually the Chinese Paramount leader.
*The Politburo, consisting of 22 full members (including the members of the Politburo Standing Committee);
*The Politburo Standing Committee, the most powerful decision-making body in China, which as of June 2020 consists of seven members;
*The Secretariat, the principal administrative mechanism of the CCP, headed by the General Secretary;
*The Central Military Commission

In relative liberalization periods, the influence of people and groups outside the formal party structure has increased, particularly in the economic realm. Nevertheless, in all governmental institutions in the PRC, the party committees at all levels maintain a powerful and pivotal role in the administration. According to scholar Rush Doshi, &quot;[t]he Party sits above the state, runs parallel to the state, and is enmeshed in every level of the state.&quot; Central party control is tightest in central government offices and urban economic, industrial, and cultural settings; it is considerably looser over the government and party establishments in rural areas, where a significant percentage of mainland Chinese people live. The CCP&#x27;s most important responsibility comes in the selection and promotion of personnel. They also see that party and state policy guidance is followed and that non-party members do not create autonomous organizations that could challenge party rule. Significant are the leading small groups which coordinate activities of different agencies. State-owned enterprises, private companies and foreign-owned businesses are also required to have internal CCP committees.

=== Intra-party factions ===
Chinese politics have long been defined by the competition between intra-party factions&#x27; ability to place key members and allies in positions of power within the CCP and Chinese government.

Under general secretaries Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, the two main factions were thought to be the Tuanpai and the Shanghai Clique. The Tuanpai were thought to be cadres and officials that originated from the Communist Youth League of China, while the Shanghai Clique were thought to be officials that rose to prominence under Jiang Zemin when he was first mayor, and then CCP committee secretary, of Shanghai.

Xi Jinping, who became general secretary in 2012, has significantly centralized power, removing the influence of the old factions and promoting his allies, sometimes called the &quot;Xi Jinping faction&quot;. Due to this, the old factions, including the Tuanpai, are considered extinct, especially since the 20th CCP National Congress, in which Xi&#x27;s allies dominated the new Politburo and the Politburo Standing Committee.

===Politburo Standing Committee===
===Full Politburo members===
==National People&#x27;s Congress==

Constitutionally, the supreme state authority and legislature of China is the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC). It meets annually for about two weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. The NPC elects and appoints important state positions such as the president, the vice president, the chairman and other members of the Central Military Commission, the premier and rest of the State Council, the president of the Supreme People&#x27;s Court, and procurator general of the Supreme People&#x27;s Procuratorate.

The NPC also elects a Standing Committee (NPCSC), its permanent body which meets regularly between NPC sessions. Most national legislation in China is adopted by the NPCSC. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the CCP Politburo Standing Committee.

Members of the State Council include the Premier, a variable number of vice premiers (now four), five state councilors (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), and 29 ministers and heads of State Council commissions. During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate CCP and state functions, with the former deciding general policy and the latter carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the CCP.

=== Minor parties ===
No legal political opposition groups exist in China. There are eight minor political parties in the country under the CCP&#x27;s united front system. They participate in the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) but have to support the &quot;leading role&quot; of the CCP for their continued existence, and their leadership is appointed by the United Front Work Department (UFWD) of the CCP. Their original function was to create the impression that the PRC was being ruled by a diverse national front, not a one-party dictatorship. The major role of these parties is to attract and subsequently muzzle niches in society that have political tendencies, such as academia.

Coordination between the eight minor parties and the CCP is done through the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference which meets annually in Beijing in March at about the same time that the National People&#x27;s Congress meets. In addition, there are banned political parties that are actively suppressed by the government, such as the Maoist Communist Party of China, China Democracy Party and China New Democracy Party, which have their headquarters outside of the mainland China.

== State Council ==
The Premier of China is the head of government, presiding over the State Council composed of four vice premiers and the heads of ministries and commissions.

==Local-level politics==
Each local Bureau or office is under the coequal authority of the local leader and the leader of the corresponding office, bureau or ministry at the next higher level. People&#x27;s Congress members at the county level are elected by voters. These county-level People&#x27;s Congresses have the responsibility of oversight of local government and elect members to the Provincial (or Municipal in the case of independent municipalities) People&#x27;s Congress. The Provincial People&#x27;s Congress, in turn, elects members to the National People&#x27;s Congress that meets each year in March in Beijing. The ruling CCP committee at each level plays a large role in the selection of appropriate candidates for election to the local congress and to the higher levels.

=== Administrative divisions ===

== Armed forces ==

The CCP created and leads the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. After the PRC was established in 1949, the PLA also became a state military. The state&#x27;s military system upholds the principle of the CCP&#x27;s absolute leadership over the armed forces, often referred to under Mao&#x27;s maxim that &quot;the Party commands the gun.&quot; The CCP and the state jointly established the Central Military Commission that carries out the task of supreme military leadership over the armed forces.

== Legal system ==

=== Nationality and ethnicity law ===
Nationality is granted at birth to children with at least one Chinese-national parent, with some exceptions. In general, naturalization or the obtainment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China nationality is difficult. The Nationality Law prescribes only three conditions for the obtainment of PRC nationality (marriage to a PRC national is one, permanent residence is another). PRC nationals who acquire a foreign nationality automatically lose Chinese nationality. State functionaries and military personnel on active service are not permitted renounce their Chinese nationality. If a citizen wishes to resume PRC nationality, foreign nationality is no longer recognized.

==== Policies toward Uyghurs ====
In 2020, widespread public reporting detailed the Chinese government&#x27;s pattern of human rights violations in its continuing maltreatment of Uyghurs. These abuses include forced labor, arbitrary detainment, forced political indoctrination, destruction of cultural heritage, and forced abortions and sterilization. Critics of the policy have described it as the sinicization of Xinjiang and called it an ethnocide or cultural genocide, with many activists, NGOs, human rights experts, government officials, and the U.S. government calling it a genocide. The Chinese government denies it is committing human rights violations in Xinjiang.

==Foreign relations==
The PRC maintains diplomatic relations with most countries in the world. In 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China, commonly known as &quot;Taiwan&quot; since the 1970s, as the sole representative of China in the United Nations and as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. China had been represented by the Republic of China at the time of the UN&#x27;s founding in 1945. (See also China and the United Nations.)

Under the One-China policy, the PRC has made it a precondition to establishing diplomatic relations that the other country acknowledges its claim to all of China, including Taiwan, and severs any official ties with the Republic of China (ROC) government. The government actively opposes foreign government meetings with the 14th Dalai Lama in a political capacity, as the spokesperson for a separatist movement in Tibet.

The PRC has been playing a leading role in calling for free trade areas and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbours. In 2004, the PRC proposed an entirely new East Asia Summit (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues that pointedly excluded the United States. The EAS, which includes ASEAN Plus Three, India, Australia and New Zealand, held its inaugural summit in 2005. China is also a founding member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), alongside Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.

Much of the current foreign policy is based on the concept of &quot;China&#x27;s peaceful development&quot;. Nonetheless, crises in relations with foreign countries have occurred at various times in its recent history, particularly with the United States; e.g., the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during the Kosovo conflict in May 1999 and the Hainan Island incident in April 2001. China&#x27;s foreign relations with many Western nations suffered for a time following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. A much troubled foreign relationship is that between China and Japan, which has been strained at times by Japan&#x27;s refusal to acknowledge its wartime past to the satisfaction of the PRC, such as revisionistic comments made by prominent Japanese officials, and insufficient details given to the Nanjing Massacre and other atrocities committed during World War II in Japanese history textbooks. Another point of conflict between the two countries is the frequent visits by Japanese government officials to the Yasukuni Shrine, which honors not only Japanese World War II dead but also many convicted World War II war criminals, including 14 Class A convictions.

=== Foreign aid ===

After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China under the CCP in 1949, China joined the international community in providing foreign aid. In the past few decades, the international community has seen an increase in Chinese foreign aid. Specifically, a recent example is the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a global infrastructure project that was launched in 2013 by Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The stated goal of the program is to expand maritime routes and land infrastructure networks connecting China with Asia, Africa, and Europe, boosting trade and economic growth. It involves a massive development of trade routes that will create a large expansion of land transportation infrastructure and new ports in the Pacific and Indian oceans to facilitate regional and intercontinental trade flow and increase oil and gas supply.

=== International territorial disputes ===

The PRC is in a number of international territorial disputes, several of which involved the Sino-Russian border. Although the great majority of them are now resolved, China&#x27;s territorial disputes have led to several localized wars in the last 50 years, including the Sino-Indian War in 1962, the Sino-Soviet border conflict in 1969 and the Sino-Vietnam War in 1979. In 2001, China and Russia signed the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation, which ended the conflict. Other territorial disputes include islands in the East and South China Seas, and undefined or disputed borders with India, Bhutan and North Korea.

==International organizations==
On 26 October 1971, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758 to transfer the seat from the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan to the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC).

=== United Nations ===

Today, not only is China a part of many UN organizations, it is also one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. A memo done by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission identified Chinese nationals serving in leadership position within international organizations signifies China&#x27;s increasing involvement in the international arena. For instance, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and so on are all organizations that Chinese nationals are currently in position of (The memo is updated on a semi-annual basis).

=== Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) ===

Although NGO development in China is relatively slow compared to other countries, a Harvard University academic study reveals that China had NGOs as early as during the Dynasties. Specifically in the forms of American missionaries, which assisted in rural reconstruction programs and ideological reforms locally. After the establishment of The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, Mao banned any NGOs that were related to counter revolutionary goals. During the reform era under Deng beginning the 1970s, NGOs although not completely banned, three laws were implemented to keep relatively tight control over them––the Regulations on the Registration and Management of Social Organizations, the Regulations on the Registration and Management of Foundations, and the Interim Provisions for the Administration of Foreign Chambers of Commerce in China. The latter two were implemented after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, and the general tone of all the regulations emphasized government control. For instance, the regulations require a two-tiered management system, in which before being legally registered by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, a government agency must sponsor the organization; thus, two governmental agencies must be monitoring the day-to-day operations of the NGO. However, in the 1990s, NGOs began to regain momentum despite restrictions in place. Today, the number of registered organizations in China has grown to over 700,000, &quot;... including many professional and friendship associations, foundations working in the fields of education, science, and culture, and a large number of nonprofits engaged in poverty alleviation, social work with people with disabilities, children, and the elderly. The number of nonprofits and environmental education and climate action groups has also significantly grown&quot;.

In 2017, a policy called &quot;Management of Overseas NGOs&#x27; Activities in Mainland China Law&quot; (FNGO Law) was enacted, which creates registration barriers that, for instance, require a Chinese partner organization to sign on. The reaction from the West has widely been that the space for NGOs to conduct work in may be shrinking.

Many NGOs in the PRC have been described as government-organized non-governmental organization (GONGOs) that are organized under the CCP&#x27;s united front system.

The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) is a people&#x27;s organization and chamber of commerce established in 1953. The ACFIC was established to advance the CCP&#x27;s interests and promote the party&#x27;s policies among private entrepreneurs. It seeks to influence policy through submitting proposals to the CPPCC, a process which requires relevant government ministries to investigate the proposals and prepare a formal response.

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) advocates for workers&#x27; interests within the CCP and the government. It also seeks to address occupational health and safety issues and carries on industrial policy oversight. It is the country&#x27;s sole legal workers union. The CCP controls the appointment of ACFTU officials at the regional and national levels.

== Civil society ==
Academic debates on whether China has a civil society are ongoing.

Within China, academic debate regarding theories of the public sphere began in the 1980s. There is no consensus and academic debates involve disagreements in the applicability of concepts like &quot;civil society,&quot; &quot;private sphere,&quot; and &quot;state&quot; in the Chinese context. Among the issues is that the terminology developed by Jürgen Habermas was developed in discourse on German bourgeois society. The major groups in Habermasian theory include merchants, bankers, manufacturers, and entrepreneurs, which is not consistent with Chinese views of the &quot;general public.&quot;

The majority of research on Chinese civil society from the early 1990s to the early 2010s has been to examine &quot;the organizational independence of civic associations from the state&quot;. Researchers have argued that the western driven definition of &quot;civil society&quot; is too narrowly fixed, which does not allow for a full understanding of Chinese civil society. Taru Salmenkari, an associate professor specializing in contemporary China and issues of democracy and civil society in East Asia at Tallinn University, has argued in her &quot;Theoretical Poverty in the Research on Chinese Civil Society&quot; that to understand Chinese civil society, one must &quot;...go beyond the question of the degree of autonomy from the state. It must address the nature of horizontal contacts through which civil society is constituted&quot;.

=== Advocacy ===
A 2013 study by Harvard University found that while the censorship exists, the purpose of the censorship is not to silence all comments made about the state or any particular issues, but rather to prevent and reduce the probability of collective action. As the study illustrates, allowing social media to flourish also has allowed negative and positive comments about the state and its leaders to exist. According to another study, the development of technology and the internet has also allowed certain civil society advocacy, such as the Weiquan movement, to flourish.

=== Protests ===
The authoritarian government in China suppresses protests that challenge the authority of the government while showing greater tolerance for protests that are rooted in localized economic or social unrest. Under Xi Jinping&#x27;s rule, the government has resorted to greater suppression of dissent.

=== Citizen surveys ===
Surveys have shown a high level of the Chinese public&#x27;s satisfaction with their government. These views are generally attributed to the material comforts and security available to large segments of the Chinese populace as well as the government&#x27;s attentiveness and responsiveness. A majority of the Chinese middle class are satisfied with the CCP and are among those who tend to credit it for the increase of living standards in China since reform and opening up.

A 2009 study by academic Tony Sachs found that 95.9% of Chinese citizens were relatively satisfied or extremely satisfied with the central government, with the figure dropping to 61.5% for their local governments.

According to the World Values Survey covering 2017 to 2020, 95% of Chinese respondents have significant confidence in their government. Confidence decreased to 91% in the survey&#x27;s 2022 edition.

A 2020 survey by Harvard University found that citizen satisfaction with the government had increased since 2003, also rating China&#x27;s government as more effective and capable than ever before in the survey&#x27;s history. A 2020 study by University of Southern California researchers affiliated with the Hoover Institution found that more anonymous surveys show 50 to 70 percent support for the CCP, much lower than what direct surveys show at above 90 percent. The same survey found that Han Chinese are more supportive of the CCP than are ethnic minorities and that minorities tend to conceal their views of the CCP.

Survey results from 2014 to 2020 show no clear alignment along the left-right spectrum or pro-regime anti-regime positions. Wealthier and more educated Chinese tend to prefer market liberalization, political democratization, and are less nationalistic, while poorer and less educated citizens show the opposite trend. This may be a reflection of how the former group has benefited more from China&#x27;s market reforms.

Survey data compiled by academic Bruce Dickson concludes that approximately 70% of China&#x27;s population supports the Chinese Dream.

Summarizing survey data and publishing in 2024, academic Lan Xiaohuan writes that overall satisfaction is approximately 83% for the central government, 78% for provincial governments, and 70% for county and township governments.

<text>The People&#x27;s Republic of China possesses a diversified communications system that links all parts of the country by Internet, telephone, telegraph, radio, and television. The country is served by an extensive system of automatic telephone exchanges connected by modern networks of fiber-optic cable, coaxial cable, microwave radio relay, and a domestic satellite system; cellular telephone service is widely available, expanding rapidly, and includes roaming service to foreign countries. Fiber to the x infrastructure has been expanded rapidly in recent years.

==History==

Telegraphy entered China in 1871 when a newly laid cable between Shanghai and Hong Kong linked Qing-era China to the British-dominated international telegraph system.

When the People&#x27;s Republic was founded in 1949, the telecommunications systems and facilities in China first established by the Qing and Republican ITA and Ministry of Posts and Communications had been seriously damaged from over thirty years of on and off war between warlords, Japan, and the two sides of the Chinese Civil War. What little remained was largely outdated and rudimentary and limited to the eastern coastal cities, the Nanjing-Shanghai region, and a few interior cities. In the 1950s existing facilities were repaired, and, with Soviet assistance, considerable progress was made toward establishing a long-distance telephone wire network connecting Beijing to provincial-level capitals.

Communications in China were established rapidly in the early 1950s. By 1952 the principal telecommunications network centered on Beijing, and links to all large cities had finally been established. Work quickly got under way to repair, renovate and expand the system, and from 1956 telecommunications routes were extended more rapidly. To increase the efficiency of the communications system, the same lines were used for both telegraphic and telephone service, while Teletype and television (broadcasting) services were also added.

In addition, conference telephone service was initiated, radio communications were improved, and the production of telecommunications equipment was accelerated. Growth in telecommunications halted with the general economic collapse after the Great Leap Forward (1958–1960) but revived in the 1960s after the telephone network was expanded and improved equipment was introduced, including imports of Western plants and equipment.

In the years immediately following 1949, telecommunications – by telegraph or telephone – mainly used wire; by the 1970s, however, radio telecommunications equipment were increasingly used and began to replace wire lines. Microwave and satellite transmissions were soon introduced and have now become common. (China launched its first television-broadcast satellite in 1986.) In 1956 the first automatic speed Teletype was installed on the Beijing-Lhasa line. By 1964 such machines had been installed in most of China&#x27;s major cities. Radio-television service also was installed in major cities, and radio teleprinters became widely used.

Telecommunications networks expanded significantly as a result of the Third Front campaign to develop basic industry in national defense industry in China&#x27;s rugged interior in case of invasion by the Soviet Union or the United States. Production of radios within the Third Front regions rose by 11,668%.

An important component of the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1971–1975) was a major development program for the telecommunications system. The program allotted top priority to scarce electronics and construction resources and dramatically improved all aspects of China&#x27;s telecommunications capabilities.

Microwave radio relay lines and buried cable lines were constructed to create a network of wideband carrier trunk lines, which covered the entire country. China was linked to the international telecommunications network by the installation of communications satellite ground stations and the construction of coaxial cables linking Guangdong Province with Hong Kong and Macau. Provincial-level units and municipalities rapidly expanded local telephone and wire broadcasting networks. Expansion and modernization of the telecommunications system continued throughout the late-1970s and early 1980s, giving particular emphasis to the production of radio and television sets and expanded broadcasting capabilities.

By 1987, China possessed a diversified telecommunications system that linked all parts of the country by telephone, telegraph, radio, and television. None of the telecommunications forms were as prevalent or as advanced as those in modern Western countries, but the system included some of the most sophisticated technology in the world and constituted a foundation for further development of a modern network.

Overall, China&#x27;s telecommunications services improved enormously during the 1980s, and, the pace of telecommunications growth and technology upgrading increased even more rapidly after 1990, especially as fiber-optic systems and digital technology were installed. After 1997, China&#x27;s telecommunications services were enhanced further with the acquisition of Hong Kong&#x27;s highly advanced systems. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, foreign investment in the country&#x27;s telecommunications sector further encouraged growth. Notable has been the tremendous increase in Internet and cellular phone usage. China became the world leader in the early 21st century, in terms of number of cell phone subscribers. The nation ranks first in the world in numbers of both mobile and fixed-line telephones, and first in the number of internet users.

China is the largest user of largest Voice calling over the Internet or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services with 51 million Tom-Skype users as of November 2007.

==History of telecommunications services==

In 1987 the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (now the Ministry of Information Industry) administered China&#x27;s telecommunications systems and related research and production facilities. Besides postal services, some of which were handled by electronic means, the ministry was involved in a wide spectrum of telephone, wire, telegraph, and international communications (see Postage stamps and postal history of the People&#x27;s Republic of China). The Ministry of Radio and Television was established as a separate entity in 1982 to administer and upgrade the status of television and radio broadcasting. Subordinate to this ministry were the Central People&#x27;s Broadcasting Station, Radio Beijing, and China Central Television. Additionally, the various broadcasting training, talent-search, research, publishing, and manufacturing organizations were brought under the control of the Ministry of Radio and Television. In 1986 responsibility for the movie industry was transferred from the Ministry of Culture to the new Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and Television.

As of 1987 the quality of telecommunications services in China had improved markedly over earlier years. A considerable influx of foreign technology and increased domestic production capabilities had a major impact in the post-Mao period.

The primary form of telecommunications in the 1980s was local and long-distance telephone service administered by six regional bureaus: Beijing (north region), Shanghai (east region), Xi&#x27;an (northwest region), Chengdu (southwest region), Wuhan (centralsouth region), and Shenyang (northeast region). These regional headquarters served as switching centers for provincial-level subsystems. By 1986 China had nearly 3 million telephone exchange lines, including 34,000 long-distance exchange lines with direct, automatic service to 24 cities. By late 1986 fiber optic communications technology was being employed to relieve the strain on existing telephone circuits. International service was routed through overseas exchanges located in Beijing and Shanghai. Guangdong Province had coaxial cable and microwave lines linking it to Hong Kong and Macau.

The large, continuously upgraded satellite ground stations, originally installed in 1972 to provide live coverage of the visits to China by U.S. president Richard M. Nixon and Japanese prime minister Kakuei Tanaka, still served as the base for China&#x27;s international satellite communications network in the mid-1980s. By 1977 China had joined Intelsat and, using ground stations in Beijing and Shanghai, had linked up with satellites over the Indian and Pacific oceans.

In April 1984 China launched an experimental communications satellite for trial transmission of broadcasts, telegrams, telephone calls, and facsimile, probably to remote areas of the country. In February 1986 China launched its first fully operational telecommunications and broadcast satellite. The quality and communications capacity of the second satellite reportedly was much greater than the first. In mid-1987 both satellites were still functioning. With these satellites in place China&#x27;s domestic satellite communication network went into operation, facilitating television and radio transmissions and providing direct-dial longdistance telephone, telegraph, and facsimile service. The network had ground stations in Beijing, Urumqi, Hohhot, Lhasa, and Guangzhou, which also were linked to an Intelsat satellite over the Indian Ocean.

Telegraph development received lower priority than the telephone network largely because of the difficulties involved in transmitting the written Chinese language. Computer technology gradually alleviated these problems and facilitated further growth in this area. By 1983 China had nearly 10,000 telegraph cables and telex lines transmitting over 170 million messages annually. Most telegrams were transmitted by cables or by shortwave radio. Cutmicrowave transmission also was used. Teletype transmission was used for messages at the international level, but some 40 percent of county and municipal telegrams were transmitted by Morse code.

Apart from traditional telegraph and telephone services, China also had facsimile, low-speed data-transmission, and computer-controlled telecommunications services. These included on-line information retrieval terminals in Beijing, Changsha, and Baotou that enabled international telecommunications networks to retrieve news and scientific, technical, economic, and cultural information from international sources.

High-speed newspaper-page-facsimile equipment and Chinese character – code translation equipment were used on a large scale. Sixty-four-channel program-controlled automatic message retransmission equipment and low- or medium-speed data transmission and exchange equipment also received extensive use. International telex service was available in coastal cities and special economic zones.

The Central People&#x27;s Broadcasting Station controlled China&#x27;s national radio network. Programming was administered by the provincial-level units. The station produced general news and cultural and educational programs. It also provided programs directed toward Taiwan and overseas Chinese listeners. Radio Beijing broadcast to the world in thirty-eight foreign languages, Standard Mandarin, and a number of Chinese varieties, including Xiamen, Cantonese, and Hakka. It also provided English-language news programs aimed at foreign residents in Beijing. Medium-wave, shortwave, and FM stations reached 80 percent of the country – over 160 radio stations and 500 relay and transmission stations – with some 240 radio programs.

The nationwide network of wire lines and loudspeakers transmitted radio programs into virtually all rural communities and many urban areas. By 1984 there were over 2,600 wired broadcasting stations, extending radio transmissions to rural areas outside the range of regular broadcasting stations.

In 1987 China Central Television (CCTV), the state network, managed China&#x27;s television programs. In 1985 consumers purchased 15 million new sets, including approximately 4 million color sets. Production fell far short of demand. Because Chinese viewers often gathered in large groups to watch publicly owned sets, authorities estimated that two-thirds of the nation had access to television. In 1987 there were about 70 million television sets, an average of 29 sets per 100 families. CCTV had four channels that supplied programs to the over ninety television stations throughout the country. Construction began on a major new CCTV studio in Beijing in 1985. CCTV produced its own programs, a large portion of which were educational, and the Television University in Beijing produced three educational programs weekly. The English-language lesson was the most popular program and had an estimated 5 to 6 million viewers. Other programs included daily news, entertainment, teleplays, and special programs. Foreign programs included films and cartoons. Chinese viewers were particularly interested in watching international news, sports, and drama (see Culture of the People&#x27;s Republic of China).

==Recent development==
The former telecoms regulator – the Ministry of Information Industry (MII) – reported in 2004 that China had 295 million subscribers to main telephone lines and 305 million cellular telephone subscribers, the highest numbers in both categories. Both categories showed substantial increases over the previous decade; in 1995 there were only 3.6 million cellular telephone subscribers and around 20 million main-line telephone subscribers. By 2003 there were 42 telephones per 100 population.

In 2004, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology began the Connecting Every Village Project to promote universal access to telecommunication and internet services in rural China. The MIIT required that six state-owned companies, including the main telecommunications and internet providers China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Telecom, build the communications infrastructure and assist in financing the project. Beginning in late 2009, the program began building rural telecenters each of which had at least one telephone, computer, and internet connectivity.By 2010, nearly every administrative village was connected to phone networks. Approximately 90,000 rural telecenters were built by 2011. As of December 2019, 135 million rural households had used broadband internet. The program successfully extended internet infrastructure throughout rural China and promoted development of the internet.

Internet use soared in China from about 60,000 Internet users in 1995 to 22.5 million users in 2000; by 2005 the number had reached 103 million. Although this figure is well below the 159 million users in the United States and is fairly low per capita, it was second in the world and on a par with Japan&#x27;s 57 million users.

By June 2010, China had 420 million internet users. Incidentally, this is greater than the population of the US; however, penetration rate is still relatively low at just under 32%. (See Internet in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.)

China&#x27;s 2.7 million kilometers of optical fiber telecommunication cables by 2003 assisted greatly in the modernization process. China produces an increasing volume of televisions both for domestic use and export, which has helped to spread communications development. In 2001 China produced more than 46 million televisions and claimed 317 million sets in use. At the same time, there were 417 million radios in use in China, a rate of 342 per 1,000 population. However, many more are reached, especially in rural areas, via loudspeaker broadcasts of radio programs that bring transmissions to large numbers of radioless households.

98% of China&#x27;s population was covered by a mobile phone network in 2011. In March 2012, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced that China has 1.01 billion mobile phone subscribers; of these, 144 million are connected to 3G networks. At the same time, the number of landline phones dropped by 828,000 within the span of two months to a total of 284.3 million.

As of at least 2023, China is the world&#x27;s biggest mobile phone market.

==Regulation==

The primary regulator of communications, in particular telecommunications, in China is the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). It closely regulates all of the industries outlined below with the exception of the radio and television sectors, which belong to the remit of the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television.

Since 2014, the Cyberspace Administration of China is responsible for setting policy and the regulatory framework for user content generated in online social activities on Internet portals.

==Sectors==

===Telephone===

*Telephones – main lines in use: 284.3 million (March 2012)
*Telephones – mobile cellular subscribers: 1.01 billion (March 2012)
*Telephone country code: 86 (see &quot;Telephone numbers in China&quot;)

China imported its first mobile phone telecommunication facilities in 1987 and it took a decade for the number of subscribers to reach 10 million. Four years later, in 2001, the country had the largest number of mobile phone subscribers in the world.

Domestic and international services are increasingly available for private use. But an unevenly distributed domestic system serves principal cities, industrial centers, and many towns. China continues to develop its telecommunications infrastructure, and is partnering with foreign providers to expand its global reach; 3 of China&#x27;s 6 major telecommunications operators are part of an international consortium which, in December 2006, signed an agreement with Verizon Business to build the first next-generation optical cable system directly linking the United States and China.

In December 2005, its combined main lines and mobile lines exceeded 743 million.

By the end of August 2006, statistics from the Ministry of Information Industry showed that there were more than 437 million mobile phone users in the Chinese mainland, or 327 mobile phones per 1,000 population.

From January to August 2006, mobile phone users on the mainland sent 273.67 million text messages. Continuing as of at least 2023, fees for text messages and MMS in China are extremely low.

Domestic interprovincial fiber-optic trunk lines and cellular telephone systems have been installed.

A domestic satellite system with 55 earth stations was in place.

International satellite earth stations include 5 Intelsat (4 Pacific Ocean and 1 Indian Ocean), 1 Intersputnik (Indian Ocean region) and 1 Inmarsat (Pacific and Indian Ocean regions).

Several international fiber-optic links include those to Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Russia, and Germany.

Fixed and mobile operators in China include China Mobile, China Netcom, China TieTong, China Satcom (former), China Telecom and China Unicom.

==== Mobile phone web users ====
The affordability of mobile phones and internet data in China has resulted in the number of mobile internet users in China surpassing the number of computer internet users.

==Trans-Pacific Express==

The Trans-Pacific Express is a telecommunications project to connect the United States with China with a fiber-optic cable that is designed to meet increasing internet traffic between the regions, with 60 times more capacity than existing cables. It is to be the first undersea or submarine telecommunications cable that directly links the US with China and the first independent trans-Pacific connection. Current cable links between China and the US run through Japan.

The project includes US Verizon Communications, Chinese firms China Telecom, China Netcom and China Unicom, South Korea&#x27;s Korea Telecom and Taiwan&#x27;s Chunghwa Telecom. The project was initiated in December 2006. Work began in mid-October 2007 in Qingdao. It was scheduled to be completed by July 2008 (before the Beijing Olympics).

Earthquake hotspots have been avoided in the planned route of the cable to avoid potential disruption to internet and telephone networks in Asia. The cable will extend more than 18,000 km and will cost about $500m. It will terminate in Nedonna Beach, Oregon with connections to Taiwan and South Korea. When complete, the new cable will be able to support the equivalent of 62 million simultaneous phone calls, with the design capacity to support future internet growth and advanced applications such as video and e-commerce.

<text>Transport in [[China]] has experienced major growth and expansion in recent years. Although China&#x27;s transport system comprises a vast network of transport nodes across its huge territory, the nodes tend to concentrate in the more economically developed coastal areas and inland cities along major rivers. The physical state and comprehensiveness of China&#x27;s transport infrastructure tend to vary widely by geography. While remote, rural areas still largely depend on non-mechanized means of transport, urban areas boast a wide variety of modern options, including a maglev system connecting the city center of Shanghai with Shanghai Pudong International Airport. Airports, roads, and railway construction will provide a massive employment boost in China over the next decade.

Much of contemporary China&#x27;s transport systems have been built since the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic in 1949. The railway, which is the primary mode of long distance transport, has seen rapid growth reaching of railway lines making it the second longest network in the world (2016). Prior to 1950, there were only of railway lines. The extensive rail network includes the longest and busiest HSR network in the world with of high-speed lines by year end 2019. While rail travel remained the most popular form of intercity transport, air travel has also experienced significant growth since the late 1990s. Major airports such as Beijing Capital International and Shanghai Pudong International being among the busiest in the world. At the end of 2017, there are some 34 metro systems in operation across China, including some of the largest and busiest subway networks in the world. Of the 12 largest metro networks in the world by length, seven are now in China. Additionally, many bus rapid transit, light rail and rapid transit lines are currently under construction, or in the planning stages across the country. The highway and road system also has gone through rapid expansion, resulting in a rapid increase of motor vehicle use throughout China. A government-led effort started in the 90s to connect the country by expressways via the National Trunk Highway System has expanded the network to about by the end of 2012 making China&#x27;s the longest expressway network in the world.

==History==

China is in the midst of a massive upgrade of its transport infrastructure. Until recently, China&#x27;s economy was able to continue to grow despite deficiencies in infrastructure development. This is no longer the case, and the government realizes that to keep the economy moving forward, they need an efficient system in place to move goods and people across the country. According to World Bank statistics, goods lost due to poor or obsolete transport infrastructure amounted to one percent of China&#x27;s GDP as recently as the most current survey (mid-1990s). Logistic costs account for 20% of a product&#x27;s price in China, compared to 10% in the United States, and 5% in other developed countries.

Ports are being improved for greater use of China&#x27;s waterways, and airports are being improved across the country. Related industries such as construction equipment, engineering, container security, and electronics and safety devices have also grown rapidly.

==Regulation==

===Mainland China===
Transport in mainland China is regulated by a new agency formed from the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Railways, the Civil Aviation Administration of China.

===Special administrative regions===

The aforementioned transport authorities have no jurisdiction in Hong Kong and Macau. Hong Kong&#x27;s transport is regulated by the Transport Department of Hong Kong, whereas Macau&#x27;s transport is regulated by the Transport Bureau of Macau.

==Rail==

Rail is the major mode of transport in China. In 2019, railways in China delivered 3.660 billion passenger trips, generating 1,470.66 billion passenger-kilometres and carried 4.389 billion tonnes of freight, generating 3,018 billion cargo tonne-kilometres; both traffic volumes are among the highest in the world. The high volume of traffic that China&#x27;s railway system carries makes it critical to China&#x27;s economy. China&#x27;s railway system carries 24% of the world&#x27;s railway transport volume on only 6% of the world&#x27;s railways. China has the world&#x27;s second longest railway network; as of 2020 it is long. About 71.9% of the network is electrified in 2019.

In 2011 China&#x27;s railway inventory included 19,431 locomotives owned by the national railway system. The inventory in recent times included some 100 steam locomotives, but the last such locomotive, built in 1999, is now in service as a tourist attraction while the others have been retired from commercial service. The remaining locomotives are either diesel- or electric-powered. Another 352 locomotives are owned by local railroads and 604 operated by joint-venture railways. National railway freight cars numbered 622,284 and passenger coaches 52,130

Because of its limited capital, overburdened infrastructure, and need to continuously modernize, the national rail system, which is controlled by the Ministry of Railways through a network of regional divisions, operates on an austere budget. Foreign capital investment in the freight sector was allowed beginning in 2003, and international public stock offerings opened in 2006. In another move to better capitalize and reform the rail system, the Ministry of Railways established three public shareholder-owned companies in 2003: China Railways Container Transport Company, China Railway Special Cargo Service Company, and China Railways Parcel Express Company.

In recent decades, rail use in China has seen significant growth in the volume of goods and passengers transported. Since 1980, the volume of goods transported (metric tons times kilometers traveled) has increased by 305% and the volume of passengers (million passengers times kilometers traveled) has increased by 485%. During this same time period, total length of rail lines has only increased by 34%.

=== Statistics ===

===Regional development===


In 1992, a new large-scale rail project was launched in China, called the &quot;New Silk Road&quot; or &quot;Eurasian Continental Bridge&quot; project. The project involved the modernization and infrastructure development of a railroad route starting in Lianyungang, Jiangsu, and traveling through central and northwestern China to Urumqi, Xinjiang, to the Alataw Pass into Kazakhstan. From that point, the railroad links to some of routes that end in Rotterdam.

China also has established rail links between seaports and interior export-processing zones. For example, in 2004 Chengdu in Sichuan was linked to the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone in coastal Guangdong; exports clear customs in Chengdu and are shipped twice daily by rail to the seaport at Shenzhen for fast delivery.

====Tibet====
A section of the Qingzang railway has been completed from Golmud to Lhasa. The section from Xining to Golmud in Qinghai opened to traffic in 1984. The railway&#x27;s highest point, the Tanggula Mountain Pass, is 5,072 m above sea level, making it the highest railway in the world. More than , or over four-fifths of the railway, is at an altitude of more than 4,000 m, and over half of it was laid on frozen earth. Because of the high altitudes, carriages are supplied with supplemental oxygen.

Linking Lhasa and Shigatse together in Tibet, the construction of a extension line of the Qingzang railway started in 2009 with completion expected by 2014.

===High-speed rail===

The high-speed service is mainly operated by China Railway High-speed. HSR developed rapidly in China over the past 15 years thanks to generous funding from the Chinese government. With ridership exceeding 1.44 billion in 2016, China&#x27;s HSR service was the most heavily used in the world. In 2016, the network is the longest in the world and accounted for about two-thirds of the world&#x27;s high-speed rail tracks and operated with 2,595 high-speed trains, accounting for about 60 percent of all global high-speed trains.

===Maglev===

China also has the world&#x27;s first commercial high-speed maglev (magnetic levitation) service, Shanghai Maglev Train (the first maglev service opened at Birmingham International Airport, United Kingdom, in 1984; however, it was not high-speed). The Chinese project, a Sino-German joint venture, was a 38-km-long route between downtown Shanghai and the Pudong airport that opened in 2003. The project cost US$1.2 billion. Low speed commuter maglevs using ingenious technology have opened in Changsha (Changsha Maglev) and Beijing (Line S1, Beijing Subway).

In January 2021 a prototype for a new high-speed maglev train capable of was unveiled. Developed by Southwest Jiaotong University near Chengdu, Professor He Chuan, vice president of the university, told reporters that the train is scheduled to be operational within 3–10 years. In July 2021 the CRRC unveiled a four-car maglev train. Long test tracks are being developed to test the vehicles.

===Railway links with adjoining countries===
The two railway links China have with a neighboring country that does not have a break of gauge is with North Korea and Vietnam. China also has links with Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Russia, which all use the gauge, and with Vietnam, where the gauge is still in use. The Trans-Siberian Railway, which crosses Russia, has a branch that sweeps down from Ulan-Ude, across Mongolia, and on to Beijing.

China does not have a direct rail link with Afghanistan, Bhutan, India, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, Pakistan or Tajikistan, but is currently planning links with Laos and India (via Myanmar).

Variable-gauge-axle trains are sometimes used to overcome the break of gauge with neighboring countries. The mainland is also linked to Hong Kong, but not with Macau, although a Macau link is planned.

===Urban Rail===

==== Rapid Transit ====

As of 2025, there are at least 50 rapid transit systems in mainland China. While it is difficult to gauge the number of systems and lines under construction or being planned at any given time, the rapid development of mass rapid transit in China suggests that new metro systems, lines, and extensions are constantly emerging and being rapidly developed. Today, China boasts nine of the world&#x27;s ten longest metro systems. Furthermore, of the 50 longest metro systems in the world, 26 are in mainland China; Hong Kong and Taipei also make the list. The Shanghai Metro only started operating in 1993 and has since expanded to be the world&#x27;s longest or second-longest subway system, trading places only with the Beijing Subway. In Mainland China, 23 urban rail lines are expected to start construction in 2025.


==== Light Rail/Tram ====
Several cities in China had tram systems during the 20th century; however, by the end of the century, only Dalian, Hong Kong and Changchun remained. Since 2010, then new tram systems opened in Qingdao, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shenyang, Suzhou, Zhuhai, and Huai&#x27;an.

In 2016 a Chinese firm developed the Autonomous Rail Rapid Transit system which has been described as a crossover between a train, a bus and a tram and is commonly called a &quot;trackless tram&quot;. As of 2021 the system has four lines in operation and is being considered for a number of other locations around the country.

==== Monorail ====
China has installed a number of straddle-type rubber-tyred monorail systems since 2005. The longest monorail line in the world, at , is Line 3 located in Chongqing. A large number of other transit systems are under construction, as well as tourist lines using suspended monorail technology.

====Suburban and commuter rail systems====
China&#x27;s passenger railways are mostly used for medium- and long-distance travel, with few trains stopping anywhere but at major stations in center cities. Commuter rail systems, characteristic of large European and North American cities, were initially uncommon in China. Instead radial suburban metro lines (Shanghai Metro Line 16, Binhai Mass Transit Line 9, Guangfo Metro, etc.) were mostly fulfilling that role. However a number of high-speed regional networks such as the Chengdu–Dujiangyan ICR, Changsha–Zhuzhou–Xiangtan ICR, Pearl River Delta Rapid Transit, and Wuhan Metropolitan Area Intercity Railway have recently started providing commuter services.

====Rail transit in Hong Kong SAR====
Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway was planned, designed, constructed and opened under British administration; it was opened in 1979 and merged with the KCR network in 2007 to form a 10-line heavy metro operation and a modern light rail network. In addition, a tramway system operates on Hong Kong Island.

==== Rail transit in Macau SAR ====
The Macau LRT was first proposed in 2003, but a final go-ahead was not given until a public announcement by the Government of Macau in October 2006. The Macau Light Transit System currently operates three lines: the Taipa Line, which connects Taipa (including Macau International Airport), Cotai, and the Macau Peninsula; the Hengqin Line, a two-station line which connects Hengqin Island to Lotus Station, and the Seac Pai Van Line, a two-station southern link connecting Union Hospital with Seac Pai Van. The Taipa Line opened on 10 December 2019, while the Seac Pai Van and Hengqin lines opened on 1 November 2024 and 2 December 2024, respectively. The East Line, which will connect the eastern terminus of the Taipa Line at Taipa Ferry Terminal with the Macau Peninsula, began construction in 2023 and is expected to open in 2028.

As of February 2025, all lines on the LRT use Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Crystal Mover APM vehicles that are two-car trains and fully automated. The car is named Ocean Cruiser. All LRT stations are equipped with platform screen doors.

==Road==
===Motor vehicles===


During the war with Japan, in the 1930s, China built many roads, the most famous of which is the Burma Road that leads southwest from Kunming to the city of Lashio. Since it came into power, the Communist government initiated a large effort into building highways that extend across China and beyond its borders.

Today, China is linked by an evolving network of highways (China National Highways) and expressways (Expressways of China). In the past few years, China has been rapidly developing its road network. 
Between 1990 and 2003, the total length of urban roads in China more than doubled; increasing from 95,000 to 208,000 kilometers of roads during that period. Similarly, during the same period of time, the total area allocated to roads more than tripled; from 892 million square meters in 1990, to 3,156.5 million square meters in 2003. China National Highways stretch to all four corners of mainland China. Expressways reach the same destinations as China National Highways, except for the rugged terrain of Tibet. An expressway link is already at the planning stage.

Highways (totaling 130,000 km) were critical to China&#x27;s economic growth as it worked to mitigate a poor distribution network and authorities sought to spur economic activity directly. The highway and road systems carried nearly 11.6 billion tons of freight and 769.6 trillion passenger/kilometers in 2003.

The importance of highways and motor vehicles, which carry 13.5% of cargo and 49.1% of passengers, was growing rapidly in the mid-2000s. Automobile usage has increased significantly in urban areas as incomes rise. However, car ownership is still low in comparison to the other members of the BRIC group of countries, being exceeded by Russia and Brazil. Indeed, the rate of car ownership in China is only expected to meet the 1960s level of car ownership of some developed countries in 2015.

In 2002, excluding military and probably internal security vehicles, there were 12 million passenger cars and buses in operation and 8.1 million other vehicles. In 2003 China reported that 23.8 million vehicles were used for business purposes, including 14.8 million passenger vehicles and 8.5 million trucks. The latest statistics from the Beijing Municipal Statistics Bureau show that Beijing had nearly 1.3 million privately owned cars at the end of 2004 or 11 for each 100 Beijing residents. Beijing currently has the highest annual rate of private car growth in China, leading to major congestion in the capital.

In 2005 China had a total road network of more than 3.3 million km, although approximately 1.47 million km of this network are classified as &quot;village roads&quot;. Paved roads totaled in 2004; the remainder were gravel, improved earth standard, or merely earth tracks.

Some of rural highways will be built and upgraded in 2008. By comparison, of countryside highways were built or upgraded in 2007, a record high. According to China&#x27;s Transport Ministry, as of the end of 2007, 98.54 percent of villages and towns had already been connected by highways.

The 2008 construction plan comprises five north–south highway trunk roads and seven east–west trunk roads and eight inter-provincial roads. Meanwhile, the central and local governments have continued to allocate funds to support the countryside highway build-up and step up construction quality supervision.

By the end of 2010, the total length of all public roads in China reached 3,984,000 km, with about of expressways by the end of 2012. All major cities are expected to be linked with a inter-provincial expressway system by 2020.

===Motor vehicles safety===

RTA fatalities are vulnerable users (68%), including motorcycle, pedestrian and NMW.

Vehicle is in cause in 17% of road fatalities.

Fatalities are 497 for 8.2 million inhabitants in Hainan, and 9959 for 83 million people in Guangdong in 2005.

===Bus rapid transit===


A number of BRT systems started operating in China, including the high capacity Guangzhou BRT. More than 30 projects are being implemented or studied in China in some big cities. In 2018, 99% of all electric buses globally were registered in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

===Trolleybus systems===

As of 2013, trolleybuses provide a portion of the public transit service in 10 Chinese cities. At one time, as many as 27 cities were served by trolleybuses, comprising 28 systems, as Wuhan had two independent trolleybus systems. The Shanghai trolleybus system, which remains in operation, opened in 1914 and is the longest-lived trolleybus system in the world. All other trolleybus systems in China opened after 1950.

===Electric bicycles===

China is the world&#x27;s leading producer of electric bicycles. According to the data of the China Bicycle Association, a government-chartered industry group, in 2004 China&#x27;s manufacturers sold 7.5 million electric bicycles nationwide, which was almost twice 2003 sales; domestic sales reached 10 million in 2005, and 16 to 18 million in 2006. By 2007, electric bicycles were thought to make up 10 to 20 percent of all two-wheeled vehicles on the streets of many major cities. A typical unit requires 8 hours to charge the battery, which provides the range of 25–30 miles (40–50 km), at the speed of around , however people usually illegal override, makes it just like normal motorcycles, capable of reach nearly . A large number of such vehicles is exported from China as well (3 million units, worth 40 billion yuan ($5.8 billion), in 2006 alone),

=== Bikeshare ===
, the Wuhan and Hangzhou Public Bicycle bike-share systems in China were the largest in the world, with around 90,000 and 60,000 bicycles respectively. Of the world&#x27;s 15 biggest public bike share programs 13 of them are in China. By 2013, China had a combined fleet of 650,000 public bikes. China has seen a rise in popularity with privately run app driven &quot;dockless&quot; bike shares with fleets that dwarf systems outside of China. One such bike share alone, Mobike, operates 100,000 dockless bikes in each of the cities of Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen and Guangzhou. Overall, there are more than 30 private bike share operators including Mobike, ofo, and Bluegogo, that have put over 3 million dockless shared bikes in various cities across China.

==Bridges==
During the infrastructure boom of the past two decades, bridge-building has proceeded at a rapid pace on a vast scale. Notably, prior to the completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge in 1957, there were no bridges across the Yangtze River, China&#x27;s longest, from Yibin to Shanghai, and all overland road and railways crossing this 2,884 km (1,792 mi.) stretch of the river required ferries. In 1992, there were only seven such bridges, but by the end of 2012, the tally had reached 73, including eight new openings in that year alone. Some notable bridges include:

* Chaotianmen Bridge, the largest arch bridge in the world by main span length
* Xihoumen Bridge, the second-longest suspension bridge in the world ranked by the length of the centre span
* Danyang–Kunshan Grand Bridge, the longest bridge of any type in the world
* Jiaozhou Bay Bridge, the world&#x27;s longest bridge over water

==Air==

As a result of the rapidly expanding civil aviation industry, by 2007 China had around 500 airports of all types and sizes in operation, about 400 of which had paved runways and about 100 of which had runways of 3,047 m or shorter. There also were 35 heliports in 2007, an increasingly used type of facility. With the additional airports came a proliferation of airlines.

===Airlines===

The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), also called the General Administration of Civil Aviation of China, was established as a government agency in 1949 to operate China&#x27;s commercial air fleet. In 1988 CAAC&#x27;s operational fleet was transferred to new, semiautonomous airlines and has served since as a regulatory agency.

In 2002 the government merged the nine largest airlines into three regional groups based in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, respectively: Air China, China Eastern Airlines, and China Southern Airlines, which operate most of China&#x27;s external flights.

By 2005 these three had been joined by six other major airlines: Hainan Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, Shandong Airlines, Xiamen Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, and Sichuan Airlines. Together, these nine airlines had a combined fleet of some 860 aircraft, mostly Boeing from the United States and Airbus from Europe.

To meet growing demands for passenger and cargo capacity, in 2005 these airlines significantly expanded their fleets with orders placed for additional Boeing and Airbus aircraft expected to be delivered by 2010. In June 2006, it was announced that an Airbus A320 assembly plant would be built in the Binhai New Area of Tianjin, with the first aircraft to be delivered in 2008.

Air China owns 30% of Cathay Pacific (second largest shareholder) and the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), an administrative agency of the State Council, owns majority and controlling stakes in China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, and Air China.

The total number of planes of all mainland Chinese carriers combined will be near 1,580 by 2010, up from 863 in 2006. By 2025, the figure is estimated to be 4,000.

Twenty-seven airlines in the Chinese mainland handled 138 million passengers, and 22.17 million tons of cargo in 2005.

===Airports===

In 2007 China had 467 airports. Of China&#x27;s major airports, Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK), located northeast of central Beijing, has the greatest flow of passengers annually and is the second busiest in the world.

Shanghai has the 2nd largest amount of air traffic in China through its two airports combined, the Shanghai Pudong International Airport (PVG), which is located southeast of central Shanghai, and Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport (SHA), which is located west of central Shanghai. Both are under control of the Shanghai Airport Authority.

The new Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport (CAN), which opened in August 2004 and is located from downtown Guangzhou.

Other major airports are located at Hong Kong, Chengdu, Chongqing, Dalian, Hangzhou, Harbin, Hohhot, Kunming, Qingdao, Shenyang, Tianjin, Urumqi, Xiamen, and Xi&#x27;an.

China is served both by numerous major international flights to most countries of the world and a host of domestic regional airlines. Air traffic within mainland China is often connected through Beijing, Shanghai or Guangzhou. They are, respectively, the main hubs for Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines. In 2003 China&#x27;s civil aviation sector carried nearly 2.2 million tons of freight and 126.3 trillion passenger/kilometers.

Passenger flights to Taiwan and other places under administration of the Republic of China must follow special rules. Flights between mainland China and Hong Kong International Airport (HKG) and Macao International Airport (MFM) are considered international.

China, however, is planning to build a new airport in Nagqu, Tibet in 2011. It will surpass Qamdo Bangda Airport as being the world&#x27;s highest airport once completed.

==Ports and shipping==


China has more than 2,000 ports, 130 of which are open to foreign ships. The major ports, including river ports accessible by ocean-going ships, are Beihai, Dalian, Dandong, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Haikou, Hankou, Huangpu, Jiujiang, Lianyungang, Nanjing, Nantong, Ningbo, Qingdao, Qinhuangdao, Rizhao, Sanya, Shanghai, Shantou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Weihai, Wenzhou, Xiamen, Yangzhou, Yantai, and Zhanjiang.

China has sixteen &quot;major&quot; shipping ports with a capacity of over 50 million tons per year. Combined China&#x27;s total shipping capacity is in excess of 2,890 million tons. By 2010, 35% of the world&#x27;s shipping is expected to originate from China. The seven largest port terminals are Dalian, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Ningbo, Qingdao, Qinhuangdao, Shanghai. Additionally, Hong Kong is a major international port serving as an important trade center for China. In 2005 Shanghai Port Management Department reported that its Shanghai port became the world&#x27;s largest cargo port, processing cargo topping 443 million tons and surpassing Singapore&#x27;s port. The Port of Shanghai is presently undergoing significant upgrades. Shanghai Model Port Alliance is responsible for many of the upgrades that are expected to make Shanghai&#x27;s port more automated, minimizing the loss of goods and time while helping Customs collect more accurate tariffs. If the Shanghai project is successful, there is interest in replicating the process in other Chinese ports.

In 2003 China&#x27;s major coastal ports handled 2.1 billion tons of freight.
As of 2007, China&#x27;s merchant fleet had 1,775 ships ( or over) /
by type: barge carrier 3, bulk carrier 415, cargo ship 689, carrier 3, chemical tanker 62, combination ore/oil 2, container ship 157, liquefied gas 35, passenger 8, passenger/cargo ship 84, oil tanker 250, refrigerated cargo ship 33, roll-on/roll-off 9, specialized tanker 8, vehicle carrier 17.

*foreign-owned: 12 (Ecuador 1, Greece 1, Hong Kong 6, Japan 2, South Korea 1, Norway 1) (2007)

Two important rail ferry crossings operate off the China coast. The Bohai Train Ferry allows freight trains to shortcut from Liaoning to Shandong, while the Guangdong–Hainan Ferry (part of the Guangdong–Hainan Railway) connects Hainan Island with China&#x27;s mainland. There are also passenger and vehicle ferry lines connecting China with South Korea and Japan, as well as with the R.O.C.-controlled Kinmen Island.

==Waterways==
China has 127,000 kilometers of navigable rivers, streams, lakes, and canals, more than any country in the world. In 2015, the traffic on the inland waterways has grown to 3.459 billion tonnes, cargo turnover to 1.331 trillion tkm. This is triple the volume since 2006. Passenger traffic is 271 million people and 7.308 billion person-km (2015), as reported by the 2015 Transportation Industry Statistical bulletin.

The main navigable rivers are the Heilong Jiang; Yangtze River; Xiang River, a short branch of the Yangtze; Pearl River; Huangpu River; Lijiang River; and Xi Jiang.

Ships of up to 10,000 tons can navigate more than on the Yangtze as far as Wuhan. Ships of 1,000 tons can navigate from Wuhan to Chongqing, another upstream. The Grand Canal is the world&#x27;s longest canal at with the southern portion serving a key role in barge transportation between Liangshan County south of the yellow river and Hangzhou. It links five major rivers: the Haihe, Huai River, Yellow River, Qiantang, and Yangtze.

Construction of new railways and highways has diminished the utility of China&#x27;s rivers for passenger transport. Nonetheless, passenger boats are still popular in some mountainous regions, such as Western Hubei and Chongqing (the Three Gorges area), where railways are few and road access to many towns is inconvenient.

==Pipelines==
As of 2006, China had of gas pipelines, of oil pipelines, and for refined products. Due to the growing dependence on oil and gas, the total length of oil and gas pipelines in China has risen to from in 1997, stretching from oil and gas fields in western and northeastern regions to densely populated coastal areas in the east. By the end of 2010, the network could exceed .

China&#x27;s pipelines carried 219.9 million tons of petroleum and natural gas in 2003. As a major oil and gas consumer, China is searching for more external supplies. Construction of a 4,200-km-long pipeline from Xinjiang to Shanghai (West–East Gas Pipeline) was completed in 2004. The government hopes that the use of natural gas will assist to reduce the use of coal which is responsible for much air pollution.

==Economic benefits==
Some economic experts have argued that the development gap between China and other emerging economies such as Brazil, Argentina and India can be attributed to a large extent to China&#x27;s early focus on ambitious infrastructure projects, notably mass transport and transit related projects. While China invested roughly 9% of its GDP on infrastructure in the 1990s and 2000s, most emerging economies invested only 2% to 5% of their GDP. This considerable spending gap allowed the Chinese economy to grow at near optimal conditions while many South American economies suffered from various development bottlenecks (poor transportation networks, aging power grids, mediocre schools...).

<text>China, officially the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), has full diplomatic relations with 180 out of the other 192 United Nations member states, Cook Islands, Niue and the State of Palestine. , China has had the most diplomatic missions of any state.

China officially claims it &quot;unswervingly pursues an independent foreign policy of peace&quot;. The fundamental goals of this policy are to preserve China&#x27;s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, create a favorable international environment for China&#x27;s reform and opening up and modernization of construction, and to maintain world peace and propel common development.&quot; An example of a foreign policy decision guided by &quot;sovereignty and territorial integrity&quot; is not engaging in diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes the Republic of China (Taiwan), which the PRC does not recognise as a separate nation.

China is a member of many international organizations, holding key positions such as a permanent membership on the United Nations Security Council. In the early 1970s, the PRC replaced the ROC as the recognised government of &quot;China&quot; in the UN following Resolution 2758. As a nuclear power, China signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the United Nations.

== History ==
==Foreign policy==
Since the start of the period of Reform and Opening Up in 1978, China has sought a higher profile in the UN through its permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council and other multilateral organizations.

China traditionally operates separate tracks of government-to-government and party-to-party relations, the latter for example via the Communist Party&#x27;s International Liaison Department.

=== Asian neighbors ===
China&#x27;s relations with its Asian neighbors became more stable during the last decades of the 20th century. It has cultivated a more cooperative relationship with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and participated in the ASEAN Regional Forum. In 1997, the ASEAN member nations and China, South Korea and Japan agreed to hold yearly talks to further strengthen regional cooperation, the ASEAN Plus Three meetings. In 2005, the &quot;ASEAN Plus Three&quot; countries together with India, Australia and New Zealand held the inaugural East Asia Summit (EAS). Relations have improved with Vietnam since the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War and subsequent Sino-Vietnamese conflicts although maritime disputes remain.

A territorial dispute with its Southeast Asian neighbors over islands in the South China Sea remains unresolved, as does another dispute in the East China Sea with Japan. For the countries involved, these conflicts have had a negative impact on China&#x27;s reputation.

The 2023 edition of China&#x27;s &quot;standard map&quot; unveiled by its Ministry of Natural Resources on 28 August 2023, met with objections from its Asian neighbors the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, and India, all of which are involved in territorial disputes with China.

=== India ===
Relations with India have fluctuated greatly over the years. After years of competition, general distrust between the two, and several border conflicts, relations in the 21st century between the world&#x27;s two most populous states stabilized, only for relations to suffer a massive hit in the late 2010s due to multiple border standoffs that resulted in deaths on both sides. While both countries have doubled their economic trade in the past few years, and China became India&#x27;s largest trading partner in 2010, there is increasing unease in India regarding the perceived Chinese advantage in their trade relationship. The two countries are planning to host joint naval exercises. The dispute over Aksai Chin (formerly a part of the Indian territory of Ladakh) and South Tibet (China) or Arunachal Pradesh (India) is not settled and plagues Sino-Indian relations. While New Delhi has raised objections to Chinese military-aid to arch-rival Pakistan and neighboring Bangladesh, Beijing similarly objects to India&#x27;s growing military collaboration with Japan, Australia and the U.S.

Relations between the two countries have deteriorated over the past decade, especially after 2020–2021 skirmishes along the border in the Galwan Valley involving Indian and Chinese military personnel.

=== International territorial disputes ===
China has had border or maritime disputes with several countries, including with Vietnam in the Gulf of Tonkin and with Japan. Beijing has resolved many of these disputes. Notably on 21 July 2008, Russia finally resolved the last remaining border dispute along the 4300 km border between the two countries by ceding a small amount of territory to China.

Territorial disputes with other countries below:

* The PRC claims the &quot;de jure&quot; administration of Taiwan Province, as well as mainland-nearby islands of Kinmen and Matsu Islands, currently controlled by the Republic of China.
* 10 features in the Yalu (Korean: Amnok) river are in dispute with North Korea.
* Border dispute with India; India claims control of Aksai Chin, which China seized during the Sino-Indian War of 1962, while China claims most of the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh (called South Tibet by China).
*Portions of the Bhutan-China border.
* China claims the administration of Senkaku Islands (Diaoyutai Islands), currently held by Japan.
*South China Sea Issue (《Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea》 was signed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the 10 ASEAN countries (10+1) in Phnom Penh, Cambodia on 4 November 2002)
** Paracel Islands administered and occupied by the People&#x27;s Republic, but claimed by Vietnam.
** Involved in a dispute with the Philippines over Scarborough Shoal.
**Involved in a complex dispute over the Spratly Islands with Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, and possibly Brunei.
**The maritime area in South China Sea, which China claimed sovereignty on area surrounding shoals and islands in the Sea, as well as historical right over the area in nine-dash line, while countries like the United States and Japan consider the maritime area as international water.
*Exclusive economic zone disputes with North Korea in the Yellow Sea; South Korea in the Yellow and East China Seas; Japan in the East China Sea (East China Sea EEZ disputes); Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia in the South China Sea.

Territorial disputes listed above as between the PRC and ROC (&quot;Taiwan&quot;) stems from the question of which government is the legitimate government of China. The Republic of China which views itself as the successor state of the Qing Dynasty did not renounce any territory which fell under de facto control of other states (i.e. Mongolia), but has largely been a non-participant in enforcing these claims. The People&#x27;s Republic of China which inherited the claims has settled a number of such disputes with Mongolia and Russia via bilateral treaties, not recognized by the Republic of China. In this respect, the territorial disputes between the PRC and neighboring countries may be considered a subset of those between the ROC and said countries.

Bloomberg News reports that these disputes are undermining China&#x27;s attempts to charm its neighbors away from American influence. China has come to rely more on military power to resolve these disputes. China has made double digit percentage increases in its military budget for many years, though as a percentage of its fast growing GDP falling from 1.4% in 2006 to 1.3% in 2011. This may lead to a China causing its own encirclement by nations that are ever more firmly aligned against an increasingly well armed and dominant China. As of 2013 this has caused even the Philippines to invite back onto their soil not just the Americans, but also the Japanese.

In March 2024, it was revealed that Japan and the European Union are set to engage in discussions regarding cooperation on advanced materials for next-generation chips and batteries, aiming to decrease their dependence on China. EU Commissioner for Innovation and Research, Iliana Ivanova, highlighted the potential mutual benefits of establishing a dialogue framework.

===21st century===

At a national meeting on diplomatic work in August 2004, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary Hu Jintao reiterated that China will continue its &quot;independent foreign policy of peaceful development,&quot; stressing the need for a peaceful and stable international environment, especially among China&#x27;s neighbors, that will foster &quot;mutually beneficial cooperation&quot; and &quot;common development.&quot; This policy line had varied little in intent since the People&#x27;s Republic was established in 1949, but the rhetoric has varied in its stridency to reflect periods of domestic political upheaval.

In 2007, Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Qin Gang made an eight-point statement explaining the diplomatic philosophy of China in response to U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s earlier remarks on China&#x27;s military spending and China&#x27;s anti-satellite test in January 2007 posing a global threat.

In 2011, Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi outlined plans for an &quot;integrated approach&quot; that would serve China&#x27;s economic development.

In 2016, during the 6th Plenum of 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Party General Secretary Xi Jinping has presented efforts for greater transparency in the decision-making process in local governance, which also represent his effort in establishing a positive image of China&#x27;s Communist Party overseas.

At their annual meeting on 13 June 2021, country leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) criticized China for a series of abuses. The G7 nations—the US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Japan—had been hesitant about acting separately. Pressured by US President Joe Biden, they unanimously agreed on a sharp criticism, followed by a similar strong unanimous attack by NATO members the next day. The criticisms focused on the mistreatment of the Uyghur minority, the systematic destruction of democracy in Hong Kong, repeated military threats against Taiwan, unfair trade practices, and lack of transparency regarding the origins of COVID-19. China has rejected all criticism of what it considers to be strictly internal policy matters. On the other hand, the constellation of critics is essential to the Chinese economy in terms of jobs, investments and purchases of its huge quantity of exports.

China&#x27;s early success in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic facilitated its mask diplomacy. Chinese ownership of much of the global medical supply chain enhanced its ability to send doctors and medical equipment to suffering countries. China soon followed its mask diplomacy with vaccine diplomacy. China&#x27;s infection rates were sufficiently low that it could send vaccines abroad without domestic objections. Academic Suisheng Zhao writes that &quot;[j]ust by showing up and helping plug the colossal gaps in the global supply, China gained ground.&quot;

== Economic policy ==
China increased its standing as a responsible global actor during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. When Western countries were nearing financial disaster, China created credit for spending on infrastructure. This both helped stabilize the global economy and it also provided an opportunity for China to retool its own infrastructure.

The Communist Party&#x27;s Seventeenth National Congress in 2007 made the negotiation of free trade agreements a priority and was further emphasized following a 2015 State Council opinion. The pace of China&#x27;s free trade agreement negotiations has accelerated since 2007.

China has invested in many infrastructure projects around Eurasia and Africa, including the Eurasian Land Bridge, Sino-Myanmar pipelines and railway and an economic corridor and a port in Pakistan.

=== Debt trap allegations ===
China financed Hambantota International Port in Sri Lanka, which drew allegations of debt-trap diplomacy when Sri Lanka defaulted on its loans and China took control of the port for 99 years. Some western analysts have suggested China&#x27;s debt-trap diplomacy may hide hegemonic intentions and challenges to states&#x27; sovereignty. A 2022 study from Johns Hopkins University&#x27;s China Africa Research Initiative found that contrary to popular narratives regarding Hambantota port, there were no Chinese debt-to-equity swaps, no asset seizures, and no &quot;hidden debt.&quot; It concluded that &quot;the popular narrative of Sri Lanka getting caught in a Chinese debt-trap has been debunked on many occasions.&quot; Numerous other academics have also argued that the notion of a Chinese &quot;debt-trap&quot; is false, and have called the allegation a &quot;meme&quot; based on anxiety about China&#x27;s rise, a function of China-US rivalries rather than reality, and that such allegations of &quot;neo-colonialism&quot; are false or misrepresentations. As of 2021, China had not seized the Sri Lankan port or any other asset from another country.

===Recent initiatives===

As the Trump administration in the United States opened a trade and tariff war with China in 2017, China&#x27;s response has been to set up its own multinational trading arrangements. In late March 2019, Xi Jinping moved forward with major trading deals with France and Italy. French President Emmanuel Macron and Xi Jinping signed a series of large-scale trade agreements that covers many sectors over a period of years. The centerpiece was a €30 billion purchase of airplanes from Airbus. The new trade agreement also covered French exports of chicken, a French-built offshore wind farm in China, and a Franco-Chinese cooperation fund, as well as co-financing between BNP Paribas and the Bank of China. Other plans include billions of euros to be spent on modernizing Chinese factories, as well as new ship building. The same week Xi Jinping signed an infrastructure plan with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. Italy became the first European power to join the Belt and Road Initiative.

As of fall 2023, Italy has started the process to exit the Belt and Road Initiative by not renewing the five-year Belt and Road Initiative Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) of 2019 at the end of 2023. With anticipated Italy&#x27;s notice not to renew, the MOU will officially end in March 2024. Eighty percent of the 193-member United Nations have participated in the Belt and Road Initiative, and the developed Western countries have largely stayed away.

===China–United States trade war===

The world&#x27;s two largest economies have engaged in an escalating trade war through increasing tariffs and other measures since 2018.

Lawrence J. Lau argues that a major cause is the growing battle China and the U.S. for global economic and technological dominance. He argues, &quot;It is also a reflection of the rise of populism, isolationism, nationalism and protectionism almost everywhere in the world, including in the US.&quot;

=== RCEP ===
The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a free trade agreement between the Asia-Pacific nations of Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam. The agreement covers approximately 30% of the global population and 30% of the global economy. In January 2022, RCEP became the world&#x27;s largest trade bloc (in economic terms) and continues to be the world&#x27;s largest as of at least early 2024.

The 2017 decision by United States President Donald Trump to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership strengthened the appeal of the RCEP.

== International treaties and organizations ==
=== International treaties ===
China has signed numerous international conventions and treaties.

Treaties signed on behalf of China before 1949 are applicable only to the Republic of China on Taiwan. Conventions signed by Beijing include: Assistance in Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency Convention; Biological Weapons Convention; Chemical Weapons Convention; Conventional Weapons Convention; Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident; Inhumane Weapons Convention; Nuclear Dumping Convention (London Convention); Nuclear Safety Convention; Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material; Rights of the Child and on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography Convention (signed Optional Protocol); and Status of Refugees Convention (and the 1967 Protocol).

China also is a party to the following international environmental conventions: Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, and Whaling.

; Membership in international organizations

China holds a permanent seat and veto power on the United Nations Security Council. Prior to 1971, the Republic of China based on the island of Taiwan held China&#x27;s UN seat. On 25 October 1971, the People&#x27;s Republic of China took control of the seat with the passing of UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 by a vote of 76 to 35 with 17 abstentions, with support coming from several NATO countries, the Soviet Union, and India, and a notable opponent being the United States.

China plays a leadership role in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a multilateral security group which aims to reduce the &quot;three evils&quot; of terrorism, separatism, and extremism.

China was active in the Six-party talks in an effort to end North Korea&#x27;s nuclear program in the early 2000s. China hoped to play a lead role in developing the Six-Party Talks into a lasting multilateral security mechanism for northeast Asia, but ultimately the talks failed. China&#x27;s efforts in the unsuccessful tasks nonetheless raised its international standing.

As of at least 2024, China has positive relationships with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

==Relations by region and country==
Generally, the political and sociological concept of face has a significant role in Chinese diplomacy.

===Africa===


China has diplomatic relations with 53 of the 54 countries which are generally recognized in Africa. It has embassies in each of these 53 African countries, and each of those likewise have embassies in Beijing. China does not maintain relations with Eswatini, which recognizes Taiwan instead of the PRC. China also does not recognize Western Sahara, a disputed territory which is claimed and administered by Morocco.

Following the Cold War, Chinese interests evolved into more pragmatic pursuits such as trade, investment, and energy.

The Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) is the primary multi-lateral coordination mechanism between African countries and China. Chinese foreign aid is a significant area of interaction within FOCAC. Through FOCAC, China provides aid in the forms of debt forgiveness, aid grants, concessional loans, and interest-free loans.

In addition to the mechanism of FOCAC, China engages with subregional multilateral groups in Africa, including the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the East African Community (EAC).

==== Diplomatic history ====
Early modern bilateral relations were mainly affected by the Cold War and the ideology of communism. The establishment of modern Sino-African relations dates back to the late 1950s when China signed the first official bilateral trade agreement with Algeria, Egypt, Guinea, Somalia, Morocco and Sudan. Zhou Enlai made a ten-country tour to Africa between December 1963 and January 1964. Zhou Enlai visited Ghana and established close relations with Kwame Nkrumah, a leader who strived for a united Africa. Relations at that time were often reflective of Chinese foreign policy in general: China &quot;began to cultivate ties and offer[...] economic, technical and military support to African countries and liberation movements in an effort to encourage wars of national liberation and revolution as part of an international united front against both superpower&quot;. In 1965 Ben Bella was overthrown in Algeria, with a result that the Soviets gained influence in North Africa and the Middle East. Kwame Nkrumah, the most prominent leader of sub-Saharan Africa, was deposed while on a trip to China in early 1966. The new rulers shifted Ghana to the West&#x27;s side of the Cold War.

China originally had close ties with the anti-apartheid and liberation movement, African National Congress (ANC), in South Africa, but as China&#x27;s relations with the Soviet Union worsened and the ANC moved closer to the Soviet Union, China shifted away from the ANC towards the Pan-Africanist Congress. In the 1960s and 1970s, Beijing&#x27;s interest centered on building ideological solidarity. China adopted several principles, among them supporting the independence of African countries while investing in infrastructure projects. The Somali Democratic Republic established good relations with the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War era. When Somalia sought to create a Greater Somalia, it declared war on Ethiopia, with the aid of the Soviet Union, Somalia took Ogaden in three months, but the Soviet Union shifted its support from Somalia to Ethiopia, and Ethiopia retook the Ogaden region. This angered Siad Barre, and expelled all Soviet advisors and citizens from Somalia, but Somalia maintained good relations with China, which segregated with the traditional Soviet Communism. China and Zaire shared a common goal in Central Africa, namely doing everything in their power to halt Soviet gains in the area. Accordingly, both Zaire and China covertly funneled aid to the FNLA (and later, UNITA) in order to prevent the MPLA, who were supported and augmented by Cuba, from coming to power. During the Cold War, a few smaller nations also entered in alliances with China, such as Burundi under Michel Micombero.

The political status of Taiwan has been a key political issue for the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). In 1971, the support of African nations was crucial in the PRC joining the United Nations (UN), taking over the seat of the ROC on Taiwan. However, while many African countries such as Algeria, Egypt and Zambia have stressed their support to the PRC&#x27;s one-China policy, Eswatini maintains relations with Taipei. For the quest of a permanent UN Security Council seat for Africa, Nigeria, the most populous African country, relies on Chinese support while Egypt looks to U.S. backing.

In its relations with African countries, China has shown a willingness to grant diplomatic audiences at the highest levels to even delegations from the smaller African countries.

====Economic relations====

In 1980, the total Sino-African trade volume was US$1 billion. By 1999, it had reached US$6.5 billion. By 2005, the total Sino-African trade had reached US$39.7 billion before it jumped to US$55 billion in 2006, making China the second largest trading partner of Africa after the U.S., which had trade worth US$91 billion with African nations. China also passed the traditional African economic partner and former colonial power France, which had trade worth US$47 billion. In 2010, trade between Africa and China was worth US$114 billion and in 2011, US$166.3 billion. In the first 10 months of 2012 it was US$163.9 billion.

There are an estimated 800 Chinese corporations doing business in Africa, most of which are private companies investing in the infrastructure, energy and banking sectors. Unconditional and low-rate credit lines (rates at 1.5% over 15 years to 20 years) have taken the place of the more restricted and conditional Western loans. Since 2000, more than US$10 billion in debt owed by African nations to China has been canceled.

====Military relations====
Military cooperation goes back to the Cold War period when China was keen to help African liberation movements. Apart from some traditional allies such as Somalia and Tanzania, China also had military ties with non-aligned countries such as Egypt. Military equipment worth $142 million was sold to African countries between 1955 and 1977. Two decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union, military relations are now based on business interests rather than ideology.

In 2004, China deployed around 1,500 soldiers under the UN umbrella, dispatched between Liberia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. China is also present via its military attachés; as of 2007, it has 14 attachés in 14 different African countries while there are 18 African countries who maintain their attachés in Beijing. Apart from peacemaking, China provides military training and equipment to a few countries, though this does not require military forces to be deployed.

==== Culture ====
Africa is a host of three Chinese cultural centers. The first overseas Chinese center was opened in Mauritius in 1988. Two other followed in Egypt and Benin. The Confucius Institute, which focuses on the promotion of the Chinese language and culture, has 20 centers distributed around 13 African countries.

Historically, little is known about early African immigration to China, although there is no doubt and much consensus that the human species was originally from Africa. Due to recent developments in relations, many have been relocating for better opportunities. Places dubbed &#x27;Little Africa&#x27; and &#x27;Chocolate city&#x27; are increasingly receiving new immigrants, mostly Nigerians. Most of the African immigrants are concentrated in the area of Guangzhou with an estimated number of 20,000. It is estimated that there are around 10,000 illegal African immigrants in China and police crackdowns have intensified since early 2009.

In contrast, early modern Chinese immigration to the African continent is slightly better documented. In 1724, a few Chinese convicts were brought as laborers to South Africa from the Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia) by the Dutch Empire. In the early 19th century, another wave of immigrants came to South Africa as workers brought by the British to work in agriculture, infrastructure building and mining. In recent years, there has been an increasing presence of Chinese in Africa. Estimates vary by source though Xinhua, China&#x27;s official news agency, states that there are no less than 750,000 Chinese nationals working or living in Africa. The number of Chinese illegal immigrants remains unknown.

Due to the low prices of Chinese-made weaponry and military equipment, an increasing number of African countries shifted their source of supply from traditional providers such as Russia to China. However, the selling of arms to some states accused by Western countries of war crimes, such as Sudan, have prompted criticism in the West.

====Criticism====
The Zimbabwean example is relevant. Relations between China and Robert Mugabe&#x27;s regime in Zimbabwe have also been the focus of criticism by a few Western countries. China was accused of supplying Zimbabwe with jet fighters, vehicles and other military equipment. China declared in 2007 that it was dropping all kinds of assistance and limiting assistance to humanitarian aid. In July 2008, the Chinese diplomacy asked Mugabe &quot;to behave&quot; though critics see that as a way for China to protect its own interests in the country should there be a regime change.

Chinese role in Africa has sparked much criticism, including accusations of neocolonialism and racial discrimination. As a response to such criticism, China issued the &quot;Nine Principles to Encourage and Standardise Enterprises&#x27; Overseas Investment&quot;, a charter and guide of conduct to Chinese companies operating abroad. Other criticism include the flooding of the African markets with low-cost Chinese-made products, thus harming the growth and the survival of local industries and businesses.

====Latin America and the Caribbean====
 
Recent years have seen Beijing&#x27;s growing economic and political influence in South America and the Caribbean. During a visit to Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Cuba in November 2004, Chinese leader Hu Jintao announced US$100 billion worth of investment over the next decade. For instance, Cuba is turning to Chinese companies rather than Western ones to modernize its crippled transportation system at a cost of more than US$1 billion, continuing a trend of favoring the fellow communist country that has made Beijing as Cuba&#x27;s second-largest trading partner after Venezuela in 2005. In addition, China is expanding its military-to-military contacts in the region. China is training increasing numbers of Latin American and Caribbean region military personnel, mainly due to a three-year-old U.S. law surrounding the International Criminal Court that has led to a sharp decline in U.S.-run training programs for the region.

In its relations with Latin American countries, China has shown a willingness to grant diplomatic audiences at the highest levels to even delegations from the smaller Latin American countries.
Caribbean regional relations with China are mostly based on trade, credits, and investments which have increased significantly since the 1990s. For many Caribbean nations the increasing ties with China have been used as a way to decrease long time over-dependence on the United States.

Additionally, China&#x27;s policy in the region was the utilization of &quot;dollar diplomacy&quot; or the attempts to switch many nations from recognizing Taiwan as an independent nation instead to the recognition of the &quot;One China&quot; policy in exchange for Chinese investment.

More recently, during various visits by several Chinese diplomats to the Caribbean region a deal was signed for China to help establish the Confucius Institute at the University of the West Indies. These agreements are part of the basis of teaching Mandarin Chinese language courses at the regional University.

China has also expanded several levels of cooperation with the Caribbean region. China and the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago were said to have formed an agreement where asphalt from Trinidad and Tobago would be exported to China during its construction boom in preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics. In exchange, China has led several construction projects in Trinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean region via Chinese owned construction companies. Trinidad and Tobago have also mooted the idea of starting direct shipments of oil and liquid natural gas direct from Trinidad and Tobago to China, to fuel the latter&#x27;s growing need for resources to fuel their economy.

Several capital-works or infrastructural projects across the Caribbean region have also been financed by the Chinese government.

=====Antigua and Barbuda=====
Both countries have established diplomatic relations.

=====Barbados=====


Diplomatic relations between Barbados and the People&#x27;s Republic of China were established on 30 May 1977. China began providing Barbados with diplomatic aide with the construction of the Sir Garfield Sobers Gymnasium (1986), and other projects such as: construction assistance for the Sir Lloyd Erskine Sandiford Centre (1994), and renovating Bridgetown&#x27;s Cheapside Market building (2005). In 2005, China exported US$19.19 million worth of goods, while importing only $211,000 from Barbados.

The current Chinese Ambassador to Barbados is Xu Hong, who heads the embassy in Christ Church, Barbados. Hong replaced the former Ambassador Wei Qiang in 2012. The current Barbadian Ambassador to Beijing, China is the country&#x27;s former Prime Minister Sir Lloyd Erskine Sandiford.

In 2004 Barbados obtained Approved Destination Status by the government in China. Barbados and China are members of the United Nations and the Caribbean Development Bank.

Following the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, the Barbadian prime minister visited the Chinese Embassy to personally sign the book of condolence to the nation.
Over the years a number of building projects have been carried out with Chinese government assistance these include: The Garfield Sobers Gymnasium, two adjustments on the Lloyd Erskine Sandiford Centre, a Home Vegetable Growing Experimental Center, embroidery, grass weaving and feather handicraft. A consideration was also giving according to the Prime Minister of Barbados, David Thompson for China to assist with the opening of a new cruise ship facility in Barbados.

Chinese Premier Wen said that China would like to join hands with Barbados in deepening cooperation in the areas of trade, tourism, architecture, and cultural exchange.

China&#x27;s export volume to Barbados in 1999 reached US$2,035,000, while imports from Barbados were at US$13,000.

Both nations have additionally signed bilateral agreements including a Double taxation agreement and a Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments treaty.

The Chinese government remains one of the main stakeholders in the Barbados-based Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), which lends to the various territories throughout the Caribbean region.

=====Cuba=====


China-Cuban relations are based on trade, credits, and investments which have increased significantly since the 1990s. China is Cuba&#x27;s second largest trading partner after Venezuela. At a ceremonial trade gathering in Havana in early 2006, China&#x27;s ambassador to Cuba said &quot;Our government has a firm position to develop trade co-operation between our countries. The policy, the orientation, has been determined. What&#x27;s left is the work to complete our plans.&quot;

Bilateral trade between China and Cuba in 2005 totaled US$777 million, of which US$560 million were Chinese exports to Cuba. China is sending a growing amount of durable goods to Cuba. Chinese goods have become the primary tools both in the planned revitalization of Cuban transport infrastructure and in the &quot;Energy Revolution&quot; of 2006 to provide electricity to the Cuban populace.

Sinopec, the Chinese state oil company, has an agreement with state-owned Cupet (Cuba Petroleum) to develop oil resources. As of mid-2008, SINOPEC had done some seismic testing for oil resources on the island of Cuba, but no drilling. The company also has a contract for joint production in one of Cuba&#x27;s offshore areas of high potential yield, off the coast of Pinar del Río, but had done no off-shore drilling as of mid-2008.

In November 2005, PetroChina Great Wall Drilling Co., Ltd. and CUPET held a ceremony for the signing of two drilling service contracts. Great Wall Drilling has provided drilling rigs for oil exploration on Cuba&#x27;s north coast.

===== El Salvador =====


===== Honduras =====


=====Venezuela=====


====United States====


Once the UN issue was resolved, relations with the United States began to thaw. In 1972, President Richard Nixon visited China. China backed away from support of North Vietnam in the Vietnam War. In late 1978, China became concerned over Vietnam&#x27;s efforts to establish open control over Laos and Cambodia. In response to the Soviet-backed Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia, China fought an inconclusive border war with Vietnam (February–March 1979).

Formal diplomatic relations were established with the U.S. in 1979, and the two nations have experienced more than a quarter century of antagonistic relations over such issues as Taiwan, balance of trade, intellectual property rights, nuclear proliferation, currency intervention, securities fraud and human rights.

===Asia===
Generally speaking, China&#x27;s relations with Central and South Asia have resulted in steadily increasing interdependence and a modestly improved regional integration.

====Arab World====

Sino-Arab relations have extended historically back to the first Caliphate, with important trade routes, and good diplomatic relations. Following the age of Imperialism, the Sino-Arab relations were halted for several centuries, until both gained independence in the 19th and 20th century. Modern relations are evolving into a new era, with the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum (CASCF) as the major multi-lateral cooperation mechanism between China and the Arab League states.

On 10 March 2023, Saudi Arabia and Iran announced that they had agreed to normalize their relations in a deal brokered by China.

=====Medieval Era=====
During the Tang dynasty, when relations with Arabs were first established, the Chinese called Arabs &quot;Dàshí&quot; (). In modern Chinese, Dashi means Great Food. The modern term for Arab is &quot;Ālābó&quot; ().

The Arab Islamic Caliph Uthman Ibn Affan (r. 644–656) sent an embassy to the Tang court at Chang&#x27;an.

Although the Tang Dynasty and the Abbasid Caliphate had fought at Talas, on 11 June 758, an Abbasid embassy arrived at Chang&#x27;an simultaneously with the Uyghurs in order to pay tribute.

The Caliphate was called &quot;Dàshíguó&quot; ().

An Arab envoy presented horses and a girdle to the Chinese in 713, but he refused to pay homage to the Emperor, said, he said &quot;In my country we only bow to God never to a Prince&quot;. The first thing the court was going to do was to murder the envoy, however, a minister intervened, saying &quot;a difference in the court etiquette of foreign countries ought not to be considered a crime.&quot; A second Arab envoy performed the required rituals and paid homage to the Emperor in 726 A.D. He was gifted with a &quot;purple robe and a girdle&quot;.

There was a controversy between the Arab ambassadors and Uyghur Khaganate ambassadors over who should go first into the Chinese court, they were then guided by the Master of Ceremonies into two different entrances. Three Da shi ambassadors arrived at the Tang court in 198 A.D. A war which was raging between the Arabs and Tibetans from 785 to 804 benefited the Chinese.

According to Professor Samy S. Swayd, Fatimid missionaries made their Dawah in China during the reign of Al-Aziz Billah.

=====Trade=====
In Islamic times Muslims from Arabia traded with China. For instance, China imported frankincense from southern Arabia via Srivijaya.

=====20th century=====
China under the Kuomintang had established relations with Egypt and Saudi Arabia in the 1930s. The Chinese government sponsored students like Wang Jingzhai and Muhammad Ma Jian to go the Al-Azhar University to study. Pilgrims also made the Hajj to Mecca from China.
Chinese Muslims were sent to Saudi Arabia and Egypt to denounce the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Fuad Muslim Library in China was named after King Fuad I of Egypt by the Chinese Muslim Ma Songting. In 1939 Isa Yusuf Alptekin and Ma Fuliang were sent by the Kuomintang to the Middle eastern countries such as Egypt, Turkey, and Syria to gain support during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

Gamal Abdel Nasser cut off the diplomatic relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan and established the new tie with the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1956. By the 1990s all Arab states had finished to recognize the People&#x27;s Republic of China as the legitimate state of China.

The relations between China and the Arab League as an organization, officially started in 1956, yet it was in 1993, when the Arab League opened its first Office in China, when former Secretary general Essmat Abdel Megeed went to an official Visit to Beijing, in 1996, the Chinese leader Jiang Zemin visited the Arab League headquarters during his visit in Cairo, to become the first Chinese leader to have an official visit for the Arab League. China has continued to pay greater attention to the Middle East since the 2000s. With China, Middle Eastern countries benefit from a potential investment source and long-term buyer of oil and gas without the political complications that come with dealing with the United States.

===== China-Arab States Cooperation Forum =====
The core political norms that China advocates within CASCF are its Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence: mutual respect for territory and sovereignty, mutual nonaggression, mutual noninterference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful co-existence. These principles are a conservative interpretation of the Westphalian norms of state sovereignty.

The most prominent political issue advocated through CASCF is a Middle East peace process aimed at resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict (including the territorial disputes that Lebanon and Syria each have with Israel). Other issues which have emerged following the Arab Spring include the Syrian civil war, and issues in Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Sudan, and Somalia. In recent years, CASCF documents have noted Arab states&#x27; support for China&#x27;s approach in Hong Kong.

In the opening ceremony of the Forum in 2004, Chinese foreign minister Li Zhaoxing said that the Arab world is an important force in the international arena, and that China and Arab countries enjoy a time-honored friendship, remarking &quot;Similar histories, common objectives and wide-ranging shared interests have enabled the two sides to strengthen cooperation,&quot; he said. &quot;No matter how the international situation changes, China has always been the sincere friend of the Arab world.&quot;

The Sino-Arab Cooperation Forum was formally established during China&#x27;s paramount leader Hu Jintao&#x27;s visit to the League&#x27;s headquarters in January 2004. Hu noted at the time that the formation of the forum was a continuation of the traditional friendship between China and the Arab world and an important move to promote bilateral ties under new circumstances.

Li stated that &quot;the establishment of the forum would be conducive to expanding mutually beneficial cooperation in a variety of areas.&quot;

&quot;The PRC has submitted four proposals. First, maintaining mutual respect, equitable treatment and sincere cooperation on the political front. Second, promoting economic and trade ties through cooperation in investment, trade, contracted projects, labor service, energy, transportation, telecommunications, agriculture, environmental protection and information. Third, expanding cultural exchanges. Finally, conducting personnel training,&quot; he said. 
Arab foreign ministers attending the meeting agreed that the formal inauguration of the forum was a significant event in the history of Arab ties with China. They submitted a variety of proposals on promoting Sino-Arab friendship and cooperation. 
At the conclusion of the meeting, Li and Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa signed a declaration and an action plan for the forum. 
Li arrived in Cairo on Sunday evening for a three-day visit to Egypt, the last leg of a Middle East tour that has taken him to Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Oman.

=====The Joint Communiqué=====
One of the major Joint Projects involves the Environment, the AL and PRC signed the Executive Program of the Joint Communiqué between the Environmental Cooperation for 2008–2009

The League of Arab States and the Government of People&#x27;s Republic of China signed the Joint Communiqué on Environmental Cooperation (referred to as the Joint Communiqué) on 1 June 2006. The Joint Communiqué is an important instrument that aims to deepen the regional environmental partnership between the two parties. Since the signing of the Joint Communiqué, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection have co-organized two environmental protection training courses in June 2006 and June 2007 respectively, in China.

This treaty was signed by Arab Ambassador Ahmed Benhelli Under secretary general Am Moussa&#x27;s Approval, and Xu Qinghua Director General Department for International Cooperation, Ministry of Environmental Protection.

====West Asia====

=====Iran=====


=====Turkey=====


====Central Asia====
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the newly independent Central Asian countries inherited the border disagreements with China, which had themselves been inherited from czarist Russia and the Qing dynasty. In the years after the independence of the Central Asian countries, China negotiated bilaterally to resolve its borders with them individually. Ultimately, China obtained territory significantly less than it had originally claimed. Resolution of these disputes on territorial terms generally favorable to the Central Asian countries created goodwill for China, avoided conflict, and also resulted in recognition that the czarist era borders were imposed unjustly on China.

Access to energy and natural resources are important priorities for China in its Central Asian relations. China is one of the main energy partners of the Central Asian countries. Chinese oil companies have invested into Kazakh oil fields, China and Kazakhstan have constructed an oil pipeline from Kazakhstan to China and are planning to construct a natural gas pipeline. In Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, China has invested in hydroelectric projects.

China also seeks to improve land connections with Eurasia through its relations with the Central Asian countries. General Secretary Xi Jinping has called China&#x27;s efforts to build trade links that extend through Central Asia to the Middle East a New Silk Road. In addition to bolstering trade ties, Beijing has contributed aid and funding to the region&#x27;s countries.

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, of which China is a founding member, is also becoming increasingly important in Central Asian security and politics. Many observers believe that beyond fostering good-neighborly relations, China is also concerned with securing its borders as it emerges as a world power. The terrorist attacks of 11 September changed China&#x27;s view of Central Asia, causing China to pay increasing attention to potential concerns of terrorism, separatism, and extremism arising from the region. One of China&#x27;s main interests in Central Asia therefore is stability in Xinjiang, which shares a border with three Central Asian countries. The Central Asian countries cooperate with China in suppressing support for separatist groups like the East Turkestan Islamic Movement. Following the invasion of Afghanistan by the United States and the increased involvement of Russia in the region, China&#x27;s foreign policy makers began to view the Central Asia as both an area for cooperation and competition between major powers.

China plus Central Asia (also depicted as China + Central Asia; C+C5) is a meeting of the Foreign Ministers&#x27; of China and Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan. It was started in 2020. In 2023, Xi Jinping and leaders of the five Central Asian countries held the China-Central Asia Summit in Xi&#x27;an, and the summit resulted in 54 agreements, 19 new cooperation mechanisms and platforms, and nine multilateral documents.

====East Asia====
As of 2022, the general trend is that China and the other East Asian countries have increased their ties with each other, especially in economic matters and in conducting joint military exercises. Trade with China comprised 39% of all East Asia regional trade as of 2020.

=====Japan=====
Having fought two wars against Japan (1894–95 and 1937–45), China&#x27;s long-standing concern about the level of Japan&#x27;s military strength surfaces periodically, and criticism of Japan&#x27;s refusal to present a full version of the atrocities of World War II in its textbooks is a perennial issue. The relationship between China and Japan has been strained at times by Japan&#x27;s refusal to acknowledge its wartime past to the satisfaction of China. Revisionist comments made by prominent Japanese officials and some Japanese history textbooks regarding the 1937 Nanjing Massacre have been a focus of particular controversy. Sino-Japanese relations warmed considerably after Shinzō Abe became the Prime Minister of Japan in September 2006, and a joint historical study conducted by China and Japan released a report in 2010 which pointed toward a new consensus on the issue of Japanese war crimes. However, in the early 2010s, relations cooled once more, with Japan accusing China of withholding its reserves of valuable rare earth elements.

=====North Korea=====


China had long been a close ally of North Korea but also found a valuable trading partner in South Korea and eventually took a role in the early 2000s as a proponent of &quot;six-party talks&quot; (North Korea, South Korea, Russia, Japan, the U.S., and China) to resolve tensions on the Korean Peninsula. China was instrumental at brokering talks with North Korea over its nuclear program, and in 2003, there was a concerted effort by China to improve relations with the ASEAN countries and form a common East Asian market. These foreign policy efforts have been part of a general foreign policy initiative known as China&#x27;s peaceful rise. On 15 November 2005, Hu Jintao visited Seoul and spoke of the importance of both countries&#x27; contributions for regional peace and cooperation in economic development. Hu&#x27;s critics say that his government was overly aggressive in asserting its new power, overestimated its reach, and raised the ire of the United States and its allies who are close in proximity to China, such as India, and Japan.

=====South Korea=====
Diplomatic relations between the People&#x27;s Republic of China and South Korea were formally established on 24 August 1992. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s the PRC recognized only North Korea while South Korea in turn recognized only the Republic of China in Taiwan. South Korea was the last Asian country to establish relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In recent years, China and South Korea have endeavored to boost their strategic and cooperative partnership in numerous sectors, as well as promoting high level relationship. Trade, tourism and multiculturalism, in specific, have been the most important factors of strengthening two neighbouring countries cooperative partnership.

While the dispute of THAAD had initiated conflicts between the two countries in various sectors, at the end of October 2017, the two countries ended the 1-year-long diplomatic dispute and have been working swiftly to get their relationship back on track since, strengthening exchanges and cooperation between each other, creating harmony of interests, and agreed to resume exchanges and cooperation in all areas. All economic and cultural bans from China towards South Korea were also lifted as a result, with political and security cooperation, businesses and cultural exchanges between the two countries getting back to healthy state.

Upon resumption of relationship, China and South Korea have been organizing presidential and governmental visits, working together on the Korean Peninsula, assisting with the development of other countries, and cooperating in numerous areas.

====South Asia====
China&#x27;s current trade volume with all South Asian nations reaches close to $187.554 billion a year.

Beijing runs trade surpluses with many partners, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Fast on the heels of the U.S. offer of nuclear power plants to India, Chinese Authorities have helped Pakistan establish nuclear power plants of its own to meet its nuclear needs, which officially consist primarily of energy requirements, although, as per certain perspectives, this could be used for Pakistani and Chinese military, quite possibly defence, purposes. China also lends to and invests in South Asian nations with low-cost financial capital, to help their development sector, especially with the current economically struggling countries of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal

=====Bangladesh=====


Early relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China were cold due to China&#x27;s veto at the United Nations Security Council to block Bangladesh&#x27;s accession to the United Nations. Lately however China has made efforts to improve relations with many of its neighbors. Trade with China reached a record level in 2006 of $3.2 billion under the auspices of the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement (AFTA). The trade balance between the two countries are in China&#x27;s favour. China has also officially agreed to helping Bangladesh on developing their nuclear power plant. Bangladesh has also signed the Apsco convention with six other nations to form a pact with China on space exploration.

=====India=====

Despite lingering suspicions remaining from the 1962 Sino-Indian War, 1967 Nathu La and Cho La clashes and continuing boundary disputes over Ladakh, Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh, Sino-Indian relations have improved gradually since 1988. Both countries have sought to reduce tensions along the frontier, expand trade and cultural ties, and normalize relations.

A series of high-level visits between the two nations have helped improve relations. In December 1996, General Secretary Jiang Zemin visited India during a tour of South Asia. While in New Delhi, he signed with the Indian Prime Minister a series of confidence-building measures for the disputed borders. Sino-Indian relations suffered a brief setback in May 1998 when the Indian Defence minister justified the country&#x27;s nuclear tests by citing potential threats from China. However, in June 1999, during the Kargil crisis, then-External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh visited Beijing and stated that India did not consider China a threat. By 2001, relations between China and India were on the mend, and the two sides handled the move from Tibet to India of the 17th Karmapa in January 2000 with delicacy and tact.

Since 2004, the economic rise of both China and India has also helped forge closer relations between the two. Sino-Indian trade reached US$36 billion in 2007, making China the single largest trading partner of India. The increasing economic reliance between China and India has also brought the two nations closer politically, with both China and India eager to resolve their boundary dispute. They have also collaborated on several issues ranging from WTO&#x27;s Doha round in 2008 to regional free trade agreement. Similar to Indo-US nuclear deal, China and India have also agreed to cooperate in the field of civilian nuclear energy. However, China&#x27;s economic interests have clashed with those of India. Both the countries are the largest investors in Africa and have competed for control over its large natural resources.
China and India agreed to take bilateral trade up to US$100 billion on a recent visit by Wen Jiabao to India.

Bilateral relations between the two became strained due to the 2017 Doklam standoff and then later by the 2020–2021 China–India skirmishes. Relations were further strained by the COVID-19 pandemic.

=====Pakistan=====

Pakistan and China have enjoyed strong relations, which encompass military, economic and diplomatic ties, since the 1960s. UK scholar Nasser Amin considers the Sino-Pak entente to be a special kind of relationship in the post-war global system, since there are no natural ties or affinities of culture, religion or ideology that have existed between Islamabad and Beijing; rather, the close relationship appears to substantiate a fundamental premise of the Neo-Realist school of IR thought: namely, that states join in alliance with other states on the basis of power considerations, in this case a shared hostility to India.

The China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a collection of infrastructure projects that are currently under construction throughout Pakistan. CPEC is intended to rapidly modernize Pakistani infrastructure and strengthen its economy by the construction of modern transportation networks, numerous energy projects, and special economic zones. The CPEC will connect Pakistan with China and the Central Asian countries with highway connecting Kashgar to Khunjerab and Gwadar. More recently, China has signed several free trade agreements with Pakistan as well as several bilateral trade agreements such as the Early Harvest Agreement and the establishment of a duty-free export zone (Sust Dry Port) in Pakistan&#x27;s Gilgit-Baltistan. China continues to invest heavily into Pakistan, and is providing assistance in the development of Gwadar Port – the country&#x27;s 3rd most major port, timber transhipments from Mozambique, as well as improving infrastructure and the development of a pipeline from the said port towards China&#x27;s western regions.
Trade and goodwill between Pakistan and China are relatively strong due to the bordered Muslims area of Xinjiang, who used Pakistan as a transit to Mecca/Makkah for pilgrimage. Pakistani students often go to China to study while Chinese workers come to Pakistan to work on infrastructure projects. Pakistan ceded a portion of Kashmir in the 1960s. They also share the Karakoram Highway, one of the highest paved roads in the world. Pakistani and Chinese authorities collaborated on everything from nuclear and space technology where help was provided by China to Pakistan, to cruise missile and naval technology.

=====Sri Lanka=====


====Southeast Asia====

China&#x27;s geopolitical ambitions focus on Southeast Asia, where Beijing is intent upon establishing a preeminent sphere of influence. China has pursued this ambition with a diplomatic campaign designed to bind the region to China – politically, economically, and militarily. China&#x27;s transformation into a major economic power in the 21st century has led to an increase of foreign investments in the bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that share common family and cultural ties.

Historically, China&#x27;s relations with the region has been uneasy, due to the country&#x27;s involvement with the Vietnam War, the Malayan Communist Party during the first and second communist insurgencies in Malaysia, as well as the Communist Party of Indonesia and 30 September Movement in Indonesia. As a result, previously friendly relations with Indonesia under the Sukarno government broke off in 1967, and were not restored until 1990, while diplomatic relations with Malaysia were not established until 1974 and in 2015 Malaysia reached a status of comprehensive strategic partnership with China. China&#x27;s invasion of Vietnam resulted in the Sino-Vietnamese War and other border conflicts; this war caused long-lasting animosity within Vietnam against China. Relations between the two states were only normalized in 1991 as Vietnam&#x27;s closest ally, the Soviet Union, collapsed. Today, Vietnam and China have a healthy trade relationship, though tensions persist over the countries&#x27; boundaries in the South China Sea, among other disputes. Despite China&#x27;s support of the Pol Pot&#x27;s Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, which lasted long after its deposition, China enjoys a harmonious relationship with Cambodia. This relationship includes strong military and economic ties, with Cambodia defending China on the global stage; Cambodia&#x27;s government has weak popular support, opening it to coercion by the Chinese government. China&#x27;s relationship with Singapore is good, and the latter is one of only three countries that can enjoy visa-free entry to the country, starting 17 April 2011.

China is the largest trading partner of nearly all the Southeast Asian countries and one of the region&#x27;s main sources of foreign direct investment. Over the course of 2008 to 2009, China became the largest trading partner of ASEAN.

===Europe===

Relations with Europe, both Eastern and Western, were generally friendly in the early 21st century, with close political and trade relations with the European Union nations being a major thrust of China&#x27;s foreign policy in the 2000s.

China&#x27;s relationship with the Central and Eastern European Countries was generally limited during the Cold War period due to the Sino-Soviet Split and the Warsaw Pact membership of these countries. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, these countries distanced themselves from their communist pasts and oriented towards the European Union. China&#x27;s interest in Central and Eastern Europe has grown since most of those countries joined the European Union in 2004 because of the Chinese view that partnering with those countries would help Chinese economic integration with Europe more broadly. After the 2007–2008 financial crisis caused capital investment by traditional European economic powers, China established a significant presence in Central European and Eastern European markets. Cooperation further increased following the institution of the 16+1 mechanism in 2012. Generally, China&#x27;s foreign relations are weaker in Central and Eastern Europe than other developing regions.

In the late 2010s, Europe took a more cautioned approach towards China, referring to the country as a &quot;systemic rival&quot; beginning in 2019. The Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, an investment agreement first proposed in 2013 and completed in 2020, was halted before its ratification after the European Commission announced plans in 2021 to reduce dependence on China in strategic areas of the economy.

The European Union has been China&#x27;s most reliable partner with regard to clean energy and addressing climate change.

==== France ====


==== Italy ====


In March 2019, during Chinese President Xi Jinping&#x27;s visit to Italy, China signed a memorandum of understanding on China&#x27;s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with Italy. Additionally, with this memorandum, Italy became the only G7 country to join the BRI.

==== Russia ====


The end of the long-held animosity between Moscow and Beijing was marked by the visit to China by Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev in 1989. After the 1991 demise of the Soviet Union, China&#x27;s relations with Russia and the former states of the Soviet Union became more amicable as the conflicting ideologies of the two vast nations no longer stood in the way. A new round of bilateral agreements was signed during reciprocal head of state visits. As in the early 1950s with the Soviet Union, Russia has again become an important source of military technology for China, as well as for raw materials and trade. Friendly relations with Russia have been an important advantage for China, offsetting its often uneasy relations with the U.S.

==== Ukraine ====
As part of the Soviet Union, Ukraine recognized the PRC in October 1949. After Ukraine gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the two countries built formal diplomatic relations in 1992, and declared a strategic partnership in 2011.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, China abstained in the related UN Security Council votes condemning Russia. The Ukrainian embassy issued a statement in Chinese condemning Russia on Weibo, which drew over 300 million views in a day. Chinese company NetEase has published anti-war videos from Chinese in Ukraine and Ukrainians in China. However, Beijing&#x27;s failure to criticise Russia increased local hostility towards stranded Chinese in Ukraine.

In September 2022, Li Zhanshu, the third highest-ranking member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, told a group of Russian legislators that the Chinese government &quot;understands and supports Russia...on the situation in Ukraine&quot;.

==== United Kingdom ====
China established diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom on 17 June 1954. The United Kingdom was the first major Western country to establish diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China.
*China maintains an embassy in London.
*The United Kingdom is accredited to China through its embassy in Beijing, and consulate generals in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Shanghai.

The UK governed the territories of Hong Kong, from 1841 to 1941 and 1945 to 1997, as well as Weihaiwei from 1898 to 1930.

Both countries share common membership of the G20, the UNSC P5, and the World Trade Organization. Bilaterally the two countries have the Sino-British Joint Declaration.

===Oceania===
China maintains diplomatic relations with ten countries in Oceania: Australia, Fiji, the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu whilst Taiwan has diplomatic relations with the other four. The Pacific is an area of intense and continuous diplomatic competition between the PRC and the ROC, with several countries (Nauru, Kiribati, Vanuatu) having switched diplomatic support from one to the other at least once. Both the PRC and the ROC provide development aid to their respective allies. the PRC also wants to establish a preeminent sphere of influence in the Pacific Islands.

====Policy====
In 2003, China announced it intended to enhance its diplomatic ties with the Pacific Islands Forum, and increase the economic aid package it provided to that organisation. At the same time, Chinese delegate Zhou Whenzhong added: &quot;[T]he PIF should refrain from any exchanges of an official nature or dialogue partnership of any form with Taiwan&quot;.

In 2006, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao announced that China would increase its economic cooperation with Pacific Island States. The PRC would provide more economic aid, abolish tariffs for exports from the Pacific&#x27;s least developed countries, annul the debt of those countries, distribute free anti-malaria medicines, and provide training for two thousand Pacific Islander government officials and technical staff.

Also in 2006, Wen became the first Chinese premier to visit the Pacific islands, which the &quot;Taipei Times&quot; described as &quot;a longtime diplomatic battleground for China and Taiwan&quot;. Similarly, according to Ron Crocombe, Professor of Pacific Studies at the University of the South Pacific, &quot;There have been more Pacific Islands minister visits to China than to any other country&quot;.

In 2007, Xinhua, the Chinese official press agency, stated that Pacific Islands Forum member countries had &quot;spoke[n] highly of the generous assistance China has provided to the region over the past many years and expressed the hope for a further enhanced cooperation with China&quot;.

In December 2007, Dr John Lee—Visiting Fellow at the Sydney-based Centre for Independent Studies—opined in a column for &quot;Islands Business&quot;:
:&quot;Why is China so interested in the Pacific? After all, despite the differences in size, population, wealth, and influence between China and islands in the region, the Chinese have literally rolled out the red carpet for Pacific leaders. Meetings between Chinese and Pacific leaders are not perfunctory &#x27;meet and greets&#x27; in the bland boardrooms of hotels. They are often elaborate state functions with all the bells and whistles that state meetings can offer. [...] In a word, the Chinese want &#x27;influence&#x27;. China sends more diplomats around the world than any other country. [...] In terms of the Pacific, there is a more disturbing game being played out, namely the &#x27;chequebook diplomacy&#x27;, that is taking place between China and Taiwan in their competition for diplomatic recognition at the expense of the other. Taiwan matters profoundly to China—and it is largely why China is interested in the Pacific.&quot;

That same month, John Henderson of the University of Canterbury stated that, in his view, many Pacific Islanders are worried &quot;that their livelihood is being taken away by Chinese traders coming in, often getting in buying political privileges, playing a role in rigging elections&quot;. Henderson suggested that the 2006 anti-Chinese riots in Tonga and Solomon Islands could be repeated in countries such as Fiji and Vanuatu. He added that this might lead the PRC to increase its role in the region further, in order to protect ethnic Chinese Pacific Islanders. A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Fiji, Hu Lihua, responded by stating: &quot;China does not pose a military threat to any other country. China opposes all forms of hegemonism and power politics and will never seek hegemony or engage in expansion.&quot; A representative of Fiji&#x27;s Chinese community similarly rejected the idea that there might be anti-Chinese riots in Fiji, and added: &quot;The Chinese in Fiji have an excellent relationship with locals and we contribute toward the economy. We have been successful in understanding local customs. Many of us have learnt the language and have assimilated.&quot;

The final report of the April 2008 Australia 2020 Summit addressed China&#x27;s influence in the Pacific in the following terms:
:&quot;It was noted that so far China did not seem interested in exporting its political values. Its interaction with the region was economically focused or motivated by rivalry winth Taiwan.&quot;
:&quot;Noting China&#x27;s growing military power and its emerging role as a major aid donor in the region, participants agreed that while China&#x27;s visibility had increased rapidly there remained uncertainty over what it was seeking to achieve, especially in the long term. Securing energy supplies was one obvious goal. One strand of thought that had emerged was that the Chinese themselves were not entirely clear about their aims in the region.&quot;

In June 2008, a report from the Lowy Institute stated that China&#x27;s aid policy towards the Pacific was almost certainly aimed solely at encouraging Pacific countries not to grant diplomatic recognition to Taiwan, and that there was no sign of the PRC attempting to increase its military influence or its access to the region&#x27;s natural resources. Reuters reports that, according to the institute&#x27;s findings, &quot;China&#x27;s chequebook diplomacy in the South Pacific and secrecy over its aid programme to small island nations is having a destabilising impact on the region&quot;, due to &quot;concerns that dollar diplomacy was influencing local politics.&quot; A spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry responded: &quot;This assistance is on the basis of mutual benefit. It must help the local economy to develop and promote people&#x27;s livelihoods. China would never interfere in these countries&#x27; internal affairs.&quot;

In June 2009, parliamentary delegations from four Pacific Island countries were jointly received by Wu Bangguo, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress. The delegation comprised Isaac Figir, Speaker of the Congress of the Federated States of Micronesia, Tu&#x27;ilakepa, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Tonga, Manu Korovulavula, head of the Public Accounting Commission of Fiji, and Billy Talagi, head of the Legislative Committee of Niue (a dependent territory of New Zealand). The delegation also met Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, who spoke of increased &quot;economic and trade cooperation&quot;; Xinhua reported that the Pacific Island legislators &quot;expressed appreciation for China&#x27;s assistance&quot; and &quot;reiterated their countries&#x27; adherence to the one-China policy&quot;.

In August and September 2010, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy began an unprecedented &quot;goodwill visit&quot; to its Pacific allies, touring Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Tonga, New Zealand and Australia. Its aim, as reported by the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; during the ships&#x27; four-day stop in Tonga, was &quot;enhancing friendship and strengthening military cooperation&quot;.

In April 2011, the Lowy Institute issued a new report noting that China, in its approach to the Pacific, had been &quot;shifting from grant aid to soft loans&quot;, which were &quot;leading to increasing problems of indebtedness&quot; and &quot;making Pacific governments vulnerable to political pressure from Beijing&quot;. The report suggested that countries may struggle to repay the loans within the set timeframe, and that &quot;outstanding loans may well tie Pacific countries to Beijing&quot;, in a context of diplomatic competition with Taipei. The report also noted, however, that some loans &quot;are destined for projects that will create economic growth; growth that will create jobs, reduce poverty and help make repayments&quot;.

In May 2011, addressing the University of the South Pacific in Suva, PRC Ambassador to Fiji Han Zhiqiang stated that Sino-Pacific cooperation had resulted in &quot;plenty of substantial outcomes and benefits for the people in this region&quot;. He indicated that the volume of trade between the PRC and Pacific Island countries had increased by about 50% between 2009 and 2010, reaching € 2.46 billion. The value of PRC exports to the region that year was €1.74 billion (up by 42% from 2009), whilst the value of its imports from the Pacific Islands was €730 million, up almost 100%. PRC investments in the Pacific Islands in 2010 -primarily to Samoa, the Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea and Fiji- had reached almost €72 million.

In April 2012 China continued to widen its diplomatic influence with loans and aid with the region.

In late May 2022, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced that China was pursuing a regional Pacific–wide agreement known as the China-Pacific Island Countries Common Development Vision with ten Pacific Islands states. This multilateral agreement would cover various issues including law enforcement cooperation and training, communications infrastructure, cybersecurity, climate change, healthcare, and a proposed China-Pacific Islands Free Trade Area. In response, the President of the Federated States of Micronesia David Panuelo opposed the proposed agreement, claiming it would create a new &quot;Cold War&quot; between China and the West. The Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Foreign Minister Penny Wong also vowed to increase Australian investment and developmental assistance to the Pacific Islands. Though China and the Pacific Islands states did not reach a consensus on the proposed multilateral agreement, Beijing succeeded in signing several bilateral agreements with Pacific states including separate security and civil aviation agreements with the Solomon Islands, ten bilateral agreements with the Solomon Islands, and an agreement to build a police fingerprint laboratory in Fiji.

=====Australia=====
As an emerging and developing economy, China is a very important trading partner and destination for Australian raw material export for the growth of Australian economy. The two countries are currently strengthening their economic relations. The 2007 election of Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister of Australia has been seen as favourable to Sino-Australian relations, notably since he is the first Australian Prime Minister to speak fluent Mandarin, and that closer engagement with Asia is one of the &quot;Three Pillars&quot; of his foreign policy.

In 2004, Rudd, who at the time was Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, had delivered a speech in Beijing entitled &quot;Australia and China: A Strong and Stable Partnership for the 21st Century&quot;.

In February 2008, Australia reportedly &quot;chastised Taiwan for its renewed push for independence&quot; and &quot;reiterated its support for a one-China policy&quot;. In April, however, Rudd addressed Chinese students at Peking University, and, speaking in Mandarin, referred to &quot;significant human rights problems in Tibet&quot;. Rudd also raised the issue in talks with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, in a context of &quot;simmering diplomatic tension&quot; according to TV3. In August 2008, Rudd met Wen once more, and expressed his concerns on &quot;questions of human rights, of religious freedom, of Tibet, of internet freedom&quot;.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated issues and tensions between the countries, especially after Australia called for an international, independent inquiry into the origins of the disease. The subsequent changes that China made to its trade policies have been interpreted as political retaliation and economic coercion against Australia.

=====Fiji=====
Fiji was the first Pacific Island country to establish diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China, in 1975. Among the Pacific Islands countries, Fiji was, in 2010, the second largest importer of PRC exports, after Papua New Guinea, and had a trade deficit of A$127m in its trade relations with China.

Fiji&#x27;s foreign policy under Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase was to &quot;look north&quot; – i.e., strengthen the country&#x27;s relations with Asia in general and China in particular. Following the 2006 military coup in Fiji, China contrasted itself from Western countries which largely condemned the overthrow of Qarase&#x27;s government. Post-coup prime minister Frank Bainimarama continued Qarase&#x27;s &quot;look north&quot; policy. In July 2007, Finance Minister Mahendra Chaudhry responded to the contrast between Western criticism and Chinese support for Bainimarama&#x27;s government:
:&quot;Fiji has friends in China, it has friends in Korea, it has friends in [...] other Asian countries. We&#x27;re no longer relying on Australia and New Zealand. And in any event, the United States was not doing much for Fiji anyway.&quot;

In 2007, a China/Fiji Trade and Economic Commission was set up to enhance economic relations between the two countries. A May 2008 article in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; stated that &quot;China&#x27;s aid to Fiji has skyrocketed since the coup in December 2006&quot;, from €650,000 to over €100,000,000. The author of the article commented: &quot;Just as Australia and other Western donors are trying to squeeze [Fiji&#x27;s] rebel Government, China has dramatically stepped up its aid, effectively dissipating any pressure Western donors might have been generating.&quot;

=====Federated States of Micronesia=====
The Federated States of Micronesia opened an embassy in Beijing.

=====New Zealand=====
Diplomatic relations with New Zealand were first established in 1972. the PRC diplomatic representative to New Zealand, Zhang Limin, is also accredited to New Zealand&#x27;s associated territories, the Cook Islands and, since 2008, Niue. The People&#x27;s Republic of China in December 2007 became the first country to establish official diplomatic relations with Niue, and provides economic aid to the Cook Islands.

In September 2007, New Zealand reaffirmed its adherence to the &quot;One China&quot; policy.

In April 2008, New Zealand became the first developed country to sign a free trade agreement with the PRC.

On 29 September 2008, New Zealand&#x27;s delegate in United Nations openly praised the improving relations between the two governments of Beijing and Taipei.

In July 2009, Niuean Premier Toke Talagi stated that, if development aid were not forthcoming from New Zealand, he would request aid from China instead.

=====Papua New Guinea=====
Diplomatic relations with Papua New Guinea were established in 1976, soon after Papua New Guinea became independent.

Papua New Guinea is one of China&#x27;s biggest trade partners in Oceania. Papua New Guinea exports far more to China than does any other Pacific Islands country, and imports three times more from China than does any other such country. It is also one of the few countries in the region to maintain a trade surplus in its relations with China; its surplus reached a record high of A$427m in 2010.

In 1999, the government of Prime Minister Bill Skate recognised Taiwan. Skate lost power less than a week later, and Papua New Guinea&#x27;s diplomatic recognition reverted to China.

In 2003, Chinese embassy in Port Moresby published a statement of concern in reaction to comments in the Papua New Guinea press questioning the justification for PNG&#x27;s relations with the People&#x27;s Republic. The embassy statement insisted that relations between the two countries were mutually beneficial, reasserted Chinese claims to Taiwan, and concluded: &quot;It is our sincere hope that the local [PNG] media will report on China and its relations with PNG in a just and objective way, so as to further enhance the mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of our two countries.&quot;

In July 2003, PNG Governor General Sir Silas Atopare visited China, re-affirmed his country&#x27;s adherence to the One China policy, and, according to a statement published by Chinese embassy, &quot;thank[ed] the government and the people of China for their commitment in providing aid to PNG&#x27;s development&quot;.

In 2005, relations cooled somewhat when Papua New Guinea, along with Fiji, supported Taiwan&#x27;s wish to join the World Health Organization.

It was announced that members of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force would receive training provided by China. Traditionally, military training aid in Papua New Guinea had been provided by Western countries, namely, Australia, New Zealand and the U.S.

=====Samoa=====
The diplomatic relations between China and Samoa were established in 1975.

In the late 1980s, China began sending doctors to the Samoan National Hospital, and sent over a hundred over the following two decades. Samoa significantly increased its volume of imports from China in the late 2000s, while also increasing its exports to that country. In 2010, Samoa reached a record trade deficit in its relations with China, at A$70m. In 2007, China provided Samoa with an x-ray machine and several volunteer doctors. In 2008, China donated over €1,360,000 to Samoa to fund its education policies.

In March 2008, following unrest in Tibet, the speaker of the Samoan Fono (legislative assembly), Tolofuaivalelei Falemoe Leiataua, stated that foreign leaders should not interfere with China as it deals with &quot;internal affairs&quot;, and that they should not meet the Dalai Lama.

In June 2008, Samoa announced it would be opening diplomatic missions in China and Japan – the country&#x27;s first diplomatic offices in Asia. In September, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement indicating that China and Samoa have always &quot;conducted fruitful cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, agriculture, sports, culture, education and health, as well as international affairs&quot;, and that China intended to &quot;make more tangible efforts to support Samoa&#x27;s economic and social development&quot;.

In 2010, the Chinese government-funded China-Samoa Agricultural Demonstration Farm was established in Nu&#x27;u with an aim &quot;to train the Samoan farmers on voluntary basis through Chinese agricultural planting techniques&quot;. About 500 Samoan farmers received training from Chinese agricultural experts.

In 2011, 57 Samoan students were studying in China on a Chinese government sponsorship.

=====Tonga=====
Relations with Tonga were first established in 1998. In 2000, noble Tuʻivakano of Nukunuku (later to become Prime Minister) banned all Chinese stores from his Nukunuku District. This followed alleged complaints from other shopkeepers regarding competition from local Chinese. In 2001, Tonga and China decided to strengthen their &quot;military relations&quot;. In 2008, China provided Tonga with military supplies worth over €340,000.

In 2006, rioters caused severe damage to shops owned by Chinese-Tongans in Nukualofa.

In April 2008, Tongan King George Tupou V visited China, reaffirmed his country&#x27;s adherence to the &quot;One China&quot; policy, and, according to the Chinese State news agency Xinhua, &quot;supported the measures adopted to handle the incident in Lhasa&quot;. King Tupou V also met Chinese Defense Minister Liang Guanglie to &quot;enhance exchange and cooperation between the two militaries&quot;. Xinhua stated that China and Tonga have &quot;fruitful cooperation in politics, economy, trade, agriculture and education, and kept a sound coordination in regional and international affairs&quot;.

In early 2010, Chinese aid to Tonga included assistance in the reconstruction of Nuku&#x27;alofa&#x27;s central business district; &quot;an agricultural project in Vaini&quot;; health clinics set up in Vavaʻu and Vaini; the provision of seven Chinese doctors for a two-year period; and an allocation of €2.2 million &quot;for social and economic development&quot;, including &quot;soft loans and interest free loans to the Tonga Government&quot;.

In April 2011, the Lowy Institute reported that, of all Pacific countries, Tonga was carrying the highest burden of debt from Chinese loans, amounting to 32% of Tonga&#x27;s GDP. Simultaneously, the International Monetary Fund warned Tonga was &quot;facing debt distress&quot;, a &quot;very high possibility that Tonga [would] be unable to service its debts in the future&quot;.

=====Vanuatu=====
In 2006, Vanuatu signed an economic cooperation agreement with China, whereby the latter was to assist Vanuatu&#x27;s economic development, and remove tariffs on imports from Vanuatu. China also added Vanuatu to its list of approved tourism destinations for Chinese tourists. Ni-Vanuatu trade minister James Bule said his country had also requested China&#x27;s assistance &quot;in supplying machines so we can establish a plant in Vanuatu to produce bio fuel&quot;. By contrast, Opposition leader Serge Vohor has said China is exerting too much influence on the ni-Vanuatu government&#x27;s policy.

In May 2009, Vanuatu appointed its first ever ambassador to China, former Minister of Finance Willie Jimmy. Jimmy &quot;call[ed] [...] for China to have a foot firmly planted in the Pacific through Port Vila&quot;, which -the &quot;Vanuatu Daily Post&quot; remarked- &quot;no doubt caused ruffled feathers among other foreign diplomatic partners&quot;.

In July 2010, Chinese Ambassador Cheng Shuping announced that China would fund a number of projects in Vanuatu, &quot;including the National Convention Centre and the expansion of Prime Minister&#x27;s Offices&quot;, as well as &quot;the design and reconstruction of the Francophone Wing of the University of the South Pacific Emalus Campus&quot;.

== Countries without diplomatic relations with the PRC ==
China recognizes all 193 UN member states, the Holy See and Palestine, as sovereign states. However, it does not have diplomatic relations with 11 UN member states, nor with the Holy See. These sovereign entities recognize the Republic of China as the sole legitimate Chinese state.

The following countries do not recognize the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Instead, these countries recognize the Republic of China.
