<text>Ninja Tune is an independent record label based in London, with a satellite office in Los Angeles. It was founded in 1990 by musicians Matt Black and Jonathan More, known collectively as Coldcut. The label was established as an outlet for Coldcut to explore a style distinct from that of the mainstream music industry.

==History==

===1990–1999===
Following a Coldcut tour in Japan with Norman Cook (a.k.a. Fatboy Slim, then of Beats International) the label lifted its moniker and aesthetic from the Japanese TV shows of the 1950s and 1960s based on the Ninja. With their first releases in the early 1990s, Ninja Tune went on to &quot;usher in trip-hop/instrumental hip hop.&quot; according to Pitchfork.

After Coldcut&#x27;s success with their first label, &quot;Ahead of Our Time&quot;, contractual issues prevented them from releasing anything under their name. Ninja Tune&#x27;s inaugural release was Coldcut&#x27;s (under the name Bogus Order) house break collection &quot;Zen Brakes Vol. 1&quot; in 1990. The label&#x27;s profile increased when Coldcut, as DJ Food, released their funky hip-hop jazz-breaks album, &quot;Jazz Brakes Vol. 1&quot;, which &quot;blew up&quot; in the DJ circuit, according to &quot;Record Collector&quot;. DJ Food&#x27;s &quot;Jazz Brakes&quot; series were intended as source material for DJs and producers who worked with breaks and beats.

In 1992, Peter Quicke joined as label manager, as did Patrick Carpenter, a.k.a. PC, who joined Coldcut as a sound engineer. Steinski, a big inspiration behind Coldcut&#x27;s initial forays into music, released his first Ninja Tune EP as Steinski and Mass Media in the same year. According to Nate Patrin, the single &quot;builds on a catchy loop of the Jackson 5&#x27;s &#x27;It&#x27;s Great to Be Here&#x27; and creates one of the few anti-Gulf War protest songs of the era, transforming [U.S. President George H. W.] Bush&#x27;s speech into a pop hook (&#x27;Regrettably, we now believe/ That only force will make him leave&#x27;) and interspersing quotes from Jello Biafra (&#x27;don&#x27;t hate the media, become the media!&#x27;) and Mario Savio&#x27;s famous 1964 address to the Berkeley Free Speech Movement.&quot;

Between 1994 and 1997, Ninja explored the instrumental hip hop beats sound (often known as trip hop). Its pioneering influence on the genre became more prevalent with the label&#x27;s first compilation, &quot;Funkjazztical Tricknology&quot;, in 1995. The genre originated in England as a successor to acid house, taking influence from acid jazz and funk, and using hip hop style breakbeats rather than the mechanical &#x27;4 on the floor&#x27; drum rhythm of the house. 

The ongoing success of Solid Steel, and its subsequent syndication across the globe, broadcast the Ninja brand across the airwaves. The late-night Saturday show cut all manner of beats, samples, and loops into a chaotic musical blend. The show&#x27;s &#x27;everything but the kitchen sink&#x27; approach continued through Coldcut&#x27;s &quot;utterly brilliant&quot; &quot;Journeys by DJ&quot; series of mix compilations in 1995. The title &quot;70 Minutes of Madness&quot; was a nod to Coldcut&#x27;s earlier Eric B &amp; Rakim remix, and included sounds from Depth Charge, DJ Food, Plastikman, Mantronix, Harold Budd and the Doctor Who theme.

In 1994, Matt Black&#x27;s close friend Mixmaster Morris introduced Matt to Openmind – a DJ &amp; design collective in Camberwell – at the Telepathic Fish chill-out club they were running. Openmind included Kevin Foakes a.k.a. Strictly Kev of DJ Food. After submitting a re-styled company logo he was employed by Ninja Tune in the capacity of overall design consultant. Matt Black also invited Foakes to Ninja&#x27;s recording studio, where he eventually joined the many hands at work on DJ Food&#x27;s 1995 album, &quot;Recipe for Disaster&quot; (which also included Patrick Carpenter a.k.a. PC, Isaac Elliston, Paul Rabiger and Paul Brooks). 

With their two 1994 albums, &quot;Paradise Blown&quot; and &quot;Electric Lazyland&quot;, 9 Lazy 9 helped spawn the funky, subterranean sound for which Ninja Tune would earn its early acclaim, combining hip hop and funk breakbeats with jazz-influenced sound. 

Coldcut&#x27;s &quot;Timber&quot; video – an AV collage piece using analogous techniques to audio sample collage – was put on heavy rotation on MTV, and won awards for its innovative use of repetitive video clips synced to the music, including being shortlisted at the Edinburgh Television and Film Festival in their top five music videos of the year in 1998.

In 1995, Matt Black created &quot;Pipe&quot;, Ninja&#x27;s first website. The label&#x27;s current website, ninja tune.net, was developed by the following year.

Also in 1996, Ninja Tune expanded across the ocean, opening its Montreal office to manage distribution across North America.he book &quot;Integrated Performance Management&quot; described Ninja Tunes as devising &quot;a term that perfectly expresses the antitheses between chaos and order.&quot;

n 1997 Ninja Tune&#x27;s sister label Big Dada was launched. Coldcut&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Let Us Play!&quot; was released in September 1997, making its way to the Top 40, reaching No. 33 in the UK Charts. &quot;Let Us Play!&quot; paid homage to the greats that inspired them. Their first album to be released on Ninja Tune, it featured guest appearances by Grandmaster Flash, Steinski, Jello Biafra, Jimpster, The Herbaliser, Talvin Singh, Daniel Pemberton and Selena Saliva. Hex collaborated with Coldcut to produce the multimedia CD-ROM for the album. Hex later evolved the software into the engine that was used on the &quot;Let Us Play!&quot; world tour.

In 1999, &quot;Let Us Replay!&quot; was released, a double-disc remix album where Coldcut&#x27;s classic tunes were remixed by Cornelius (the opener of the album, which was heralded as a highlight of the album), Irresistible Force, Shut Up and Dance, Carl Craig and J Swinscoe. &quot;Spin Magazine&quot; stated that &quot;Let Us Replay!&quot; pieces together &quot;short sharp shocks that put the mental in &#x27;experimental&#x27; and still bring the breaks till the breakadawn.&quot; It also includes a few live tracks from the duo&#x27;s innovative world tour. The CD-ROM of the album, which also contained a free demo disc of the VJamm software, was one of the earliest audiovisual CD- Roms on the market, and Muzik claimed deserved to &quot;have them canonized...it&#x27;s like buying an entire mini studio for under $15.&quot;

Mr. Scruff&#x27;s &quot;Keep It Unreal&quot; was released in the summer of 1999. Filled with bubbly breakbeats, slick horn sizzles, and bristling house beats, the album opened with BBC Radio 1 DJ Mary Ann Hobbes asking, &quot;Are you ready Mr. Scruff?&quot;

At some point in 1999, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission decided that DJ Vadim and Sarah Jones&#x27; pro-women empowerment record &quot;Your Revolution&quot; was &quot;indecent&quot; for radio. The decision ended up in court in 2002, where arguments were advanced for freedom of speech, freedom of expression and to argue the double standards of the ban and fine.

===2000–2010===
In 2000, Ninja Tune celebrated its first decade of music with &quot;Xen Cuts&quot;, a three CD, 6 x LP box set that provided a collection of their artists. Mark Richardson with Pitchfork called the effort a &quot;mostly downtempo affair.&quot; It featured the likes of Latyrx (Lyrics Born and Lateef), The Herbaliser, Kid Koala and Luke Vibert, Clifford Gilberto, Amon Tobin and Funki Porcini.

Also in 2000, Kid Koala released &quot;Carpal Tunnel Syndrome&quot;, &quot;a playfully arranged montage of quirky sound bites, rhythmic scratching, and fluid hip hop beats.&quot; Deriving sample material from both comedy albums and sound effects records, and jazz and funk vinyl, the release received much critical success. It was called &quot;brilliant&quot; and &quot;humorous&quot; in the book &quot;Minority Report: An Alternative History of English-language Arts in Quebec.&quot; Kid Koala cut two further highly acclaimed albums for Ninja, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Some of My Best Friends Are DJs&quot; and 2006&#x27;s &quot;Your Mom&#x27;s Favorite DJ&quot;.

In 2001, Roots Manuva delivered his second album, &quot;Run Come Save Me&quot;, which was deemed one of the albums of the year by &quot;The Independent.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Mojo&quot; described it as &quot;not just a landmark UK hip hop album, but a landmark hip hop album period&quot;. The album charted at number 33 in the UK Charts. &quot;Witness (1 Hope)&quot;, the first single off the album, charted at No. 45 and was declared by AllMusic as being &quot;the best British rap single since Tricky&#x27;s &#x27;Aftermath&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Run Come Save Me&quot; won a nomination for the 2002 Mercury Music Award, and was called by &quot;The Times&quot; &quot;Too maverick, too brilliantly original a talent to be tethered by mere genre or geography.&quot; 

Also in 2001 Cornwall&#x27;s Luke Vibert joined Ninja Tune. Growing up amongst contemporaries Aphex Twin and Tom Middleton/Global Communication, Vibert had made a name for himself in experimental electronica, though his name has always been hard to pin down: he operates under several different aliases. With the moniker Wagon Christ, Vibert released &quot;Musipal&quot; on Ninja, which &quot;NME&quot; called &quot;an intriguing procession of cheeky collages.&quot;

Mr. Scruff&#x27;s second album on Ninja Tune, &quot;Trouser Jazz&quot;, was released on 9 September 2002. It charted at 29 on the UK Chart.

In 2003, Simon Green, a.k.a. Bonobo, released his first proper Ninja album, &quot;Dial &#x27;M&#x27; for Monkey&quot;, a subliminally seductive collection of atmospheric instrumentals. A live version of Bonobo soon took to the road, which seeped into the production of 2006&#x27;s &quot;Days to Come,&quot; an album that blurs the line between a programmed and live sound and created &quot;a daydream vibe embedded within its moodiness.&quot;

Blurring lines further, Coldcut collaborated with American video mashup artist TV Sheriff in 2004 to produce their cut-up entitled &quot;Revolution USA&quot;. The tactical-media project (coordinated with Canadian art duo NomIg) followed on from the UK version and extended the premise &quot;into an open access participatory project,&quot; according to author Graham Meikle. Through the multimedia political art project, over 12 gigabytes of footage from the last 40 years of US politics were made accessible to download, allowing participants to create a cut-up over a Coldcut beat. Coldcut also collaborated with TV Sheriff and NomIg to produce two audiovisual pieces &quot;World of Evil&quot; (2004) and &quot;Revolution &#x27;08&quot; (2008), both composed of footage from the United States presidential elections of respective years. The music used was composed by Coldcut, with &quot;Revolution &#x27;08&quot; featuring a remix by The Qemists.

Roots Manuva climbed back into the limelight at the beginning of 2005, with his deft album &quot;Awfully Deep&quot;. His third album, which reached number 24 in the UK Charts, was celebrated by critics for his growth as an artist, with &quot;NME&quot; calling it &quot;a set of immense maturity that never rubs your nose in its thematic complexity, compositional innovation, and thunderous thump-beats.&quot;

The Cinematic Orchestra scored a new soundtrack, Man with a Movie Camera, for a screening of the visionary 1929 Russian silent feature, &quot;Man with a Movie Camera&quot;, for the 2000 Portuguese Film Festival Fantasporto. The following year it was performed at the opening gala of Portugal&#x27;s year as European Capital of Culture in Porto in front of 3000 people. The material written for this film score laid the groundwork for what would be The Cinematic Orchestra&#x27;s second full-length, &quot;Every Day&quot;, released in May 2002, and one of Ninja&#x27;s best-selling albums. Roots Manuva featured on the track &quot;All Things to All Men&quot;, which later soundtracked the final scenes of the 2006 movie &quot;Kidulthood&quot;. The Cinematic Orchestra&#x27;s albums grew increasingly ambitious over the years, with 2007&#x27;s &quot;Ma Fleur&quot; album marking a move away from beats, and embracing folk influences. The album was based on the work of photographer Maya Hayuk (who commissioned 11 pictures based on three short stories recounting the journey from birth to death), and conceived by Swinscoe as the premise for the score of an imaginary film. Album track &quot;To Build a Home&quot; became one of Ninja&#x27;s top tracks of all time (with its fan video clocking up nearly 9 million plays), and track &quot;TBAH&quot; features vocals from Patrick Watson, which became the band&#x27;s most successful song.

Following Jason Swinscoe&#x27;s vocal appreciation of Jaga Jazzist&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;A Livingroom Hush&quot;, the Norwegian jazz band signed to Ninja Tune to re-release &quot;A Livingroom Hush&quot; in 2002, followed by &quot;The Stix&quot; later that year, and their fourth album &quot;What We Must&quot; in 2005.

Coldcut returned with the single &quot;Everything Is Under Control&quot; at the end of 2005, featuring Jon Spencer (of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion) and Mike Ladd. It was followed in 2006 by their fifth studio album &quot;Sound Mirrors&quot;, which was quoted as being &quot;one of the most vital and imaginative records Jon More and Matt Black have ever made&quot;, and saw the duo &quot;continue, impressively, to find new ways to present political statements through a gamut of pristine electronics and breakbeats.&quot; The fascinating array of guest vocalists included Soweto Kinch, Annette Peacock, Amiri Baraka, and Saul Williams.

Ninja connected with L.A. filmmaker and photographer B+, who had filmed &quot;Keepintime: Talking Drums Whispering Vinyl&quot;, a short movie documenting a meeting between jazz/funk drummers Paul Humphrey and James Gadson, and a bunch of turntablists who now scratched and sampled their breakbeats, including DJ Shadow, Cut Chemist and the Beat Junkies. This project snowballed into a live concert featuring the drum duo jamming along with the turntablists – and included extra guests Madlib and DJ Numark. In 2005, Ninja released &quot;Keep in Time: A Live Recording&quot;, a CD/DVD package that included remixes from King Britt, Oh No, J Rocc, and AmmonContact.

Back in London, having previously scored a place with his college band E.V.A. on the 1996 Ninja 12&quot; &quot;One Track Mind&quot;, Fin Greenall subsequently signed to the label as a solo artist, under the name Fink. First releasing &quot;Fresh Produce&quot; – an atmospheric set of downtempo instrumental hip hop tracks – on sister label Ntone in 2000, it was 2006&#x27;s &quot;Biscuits for Breakfast&quot; album that set Fink officially on Ninja Tune. And it set him far apart from the rest of the label, going his way to becoming a full-blown, guitar-picking singer-songwriter. Two subsequent full-lengths – 2007&#x27;s &quot;Distance and Time&quot; and 2009&#x27;s &quot;Sort of Revolution&quot; (which featured song-writing collaborations with John Legend) have seen Fink further develop this new sound.

On the topic of sound, noise manipulator Amon Tobin came back around at the beginning of 2007 with &quot;Foley Room&quot;, his sixth studio album, and a long player that was called his &quot;darkest work yet.&quot; Tobin was inspired by the work of Foley artists: a Foley room is where the sound effects are recorded for films; Foley artists use their imagination and ingenuity to make the right noise for the situation they are presented with. Amon and a team of assistants headed out into the streets with high-sensitivity microphones and recorded found sounds from tigers roaring to cats eating rats, from wasps to falling chickpeas, kitchen utensils to motorbikes to water dripping from a tap. Added to this were the sounds of The Kronos Quartet, Stefan Schneider (of To Rococo Rot), and Sarah Pagé, Tobin traveling from Foley rooms in Montreal to San Francisco to Seattle and back as he collected them (the CD release is accompanied by a short DVD, &quot;Foley Room: Found Footage&quot;, documenting the recording process).

Kevin Martin began developing his sound further as The Bug, after other projects such as GOD, Techno Animal, Ice, and Curse of the Golden Vampire. The Bug&#x27;s second album in 2003, &quot;Pressure&quot;, demonstrated a fully formed aesthetic – stark spaces, gleefully subsonic bass – holding collaborations with vocalists such as Toastie Taylor, Wayne Lonesome and Daddy Freddy. 2008&#x27;s &quot;London Zoo&quot;, meanwhile, was The Bug&#x27;s third album – and first for Ninja Tune. Recorded over three years with its maker living in his studio, without a kitchen or shower, the album included collaborations with Warrior Queen, Tippa Irie, Burial, Kode9 collaborator Spaceape, and even singer-toaster Ricky Ranking showing up on three tracks. Erik Martiny said it is a &quot;multivocal, spoken-sung, collaborative album.&quot; It appeared in many outlets&#x27; &quot;best of 2008&quot; lists.

The year 2008 launched Ninja Tune&#x27;s &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know&quot;, their sixth official label sampler, and, like its predecessors, contained high-quality picks from their major releases, with select remixes and a few rarities. While 2007&#x27;s &quot;Well Deep&quot; multimedia package shed light on Big Dada, Ninja Cuts drew a healthy cross-section from all three Ninja-associated labels.

2008 also marked Daedelus&#x27; first official Ninja album, &quot;Love to Make Music To&quot;, after his previous albums &quot;Exquisite Corpse&quot; and &quot;Denies the Day&#x27;s Demise&quot; had been licensed by Ninja Tune. The album showcased the L.A. artist&#x27;s diverse nature and his skills as a multi-instrumentalist as well as his engrossing stylistic shifts. Additionally that year (a year after their 2007 &quot;Stompbox&quot; 12&quot;), The Qemists released their debut album, &quot;Join the Q.&quot; All Music Guide, at the time, said that the group had constructed &quot;some of the most energetic breakbeats of the late 2000s.&quot; The vinyl version of the album came as four super-heavy platters, weighing nearly a kilogram.

In 2008, an international group of party organizers, activists, and artists – including Coldcut – received a grant from the Intelligent Energy Department of the European Union, to create a project that promoted intelligent energy and environmental awareness to the youth of Europe. The result was &quot;Energy Union&quot;, a piece of VJ cinema, a political campaign, a music tour, a party, an art exhibition, and social media hub. &quot;Energy Union&quot; toured 12 EU countries throughout 2009 and 2010, completing 24 events in total. Coldcut created the &quot;Energy Union&quot; show for the tour, a one-hour Audio/Visual montage on the theme of Intelligent Energy. In presenting new ideas for climate, environmental, and energy communication strategies, the &quot;Energy Union&quot; tour was well received, and reached a widespread audience in cities across the UK, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands, Croatia, Slovenia, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Spain, and the Czech Republic.

Speech Debelle&#x27;s debut album, 2009&#x27;s &quot;Speech Therapy&quot;, finally scored Big Dada a Mercury Prize, after prior nominations for Roots Manuva&#x27;s &quot;Run Come Save Me&quot; and Ty&#x27;s &quot;Upwards&quot;. With the album, NME called her: &quot;one to seriously watch.&quot;

===2010–present===
A book entitled Ninja Tune: &quot;20 Years of Beats and Pieces&quot; was released on 12 August 2010, and an exhibition was held at Black Dog Publishing&#x27;s Black Dog Space in London showcasing artwork, design, and photography from the label&#x27;s 20-year history. A &quot;stunning futurespective&quot; compilation album was released on 20 September in two formats – a regular version consisting of two 2-disc volumes, and a limited edition (of 3,500 copies), containing six CDs, six 7&quot; vinyl singles, a hardback copy of the book, a poster, and additional items. It featured new music from Amon Tobin (also as Two Fingers), Roots Manuva, The Cinematic Orchestra, Kid Koala, Mr. Scruff, The Bug, King Geedorah, Zomby, Bonobo, Toddla T, Daedelus, Dorian Concept, Floating Points, Wagon Christ, cLOUDDEAD and many others. It also included new remixes from Switch, Autechre, Benga, Cut Chemist, Modeselektor, Roots Manuva, Diplo, Gold Panda, Mark Pritchard, Rustie, Prefuse 73, 808 State, Joe Goddard, King Jammy, The Orb, Micachu, Gaslamp Killer, Kronos Quartet, Mala, El-P (and El-B) and many more. In The Independent&#x27;s &quot;Album of the Week&quot; review, the compilation was deemed &quot;a glorious celebration of Ninja Tune&#x27;s audio splendor.&quot;

As part of the 20th anniversary, Ninja Tune produced 20 different events around the world. Ninja Tune sold out Royal Albert Hall in London, with The Cinematic Orchestra, Amon Tobin, and Dorian Concept all presenting a one-off orchestral performance with the London Metropolitan Orchestra arranged by composer Ilan Eshkeri. For a separate London event, Ninja also placed a legendary rave in 3 rooms in a car park behind the Tate Modern with all of their artists in one place for the first time (artists included Coldcut, Mr. Scruff, Roots Manuva, Toddla T, The Bug, Daedelus, Kid Koala, Bonobo, Dj Food + DK, Mark Pritchard, DJ Kentaro, Dorian Concept, XXXchange (Spank Rock), DELS, Floating Points, Jammer, Dark Sky, and Offshore). For the Ninja XX gig in New York, the label&#x27;s venue (Santos Party House) was shut down unexpectedly, moving the event at the last minute to the Bowery.

In October 2011, Ninja Tune&#x27;s massive &quot;Ninja Tune XX&quot; campaign won &quot;Innovative Marketing Campaign of the Year&quot; at the 2011 AIM Awards.

It was around this time that Ninja Tune began expanding its roster in an interesting new direction, co-signing underground labels with whom they felt artistically aligned. In February 2010, LA-based producer Flying Lotus, a.k.a. Steven Ellison, announced his Brainfeeder imprint had partnered with Ninja Tune to handle manufacturing, marketing, and distribution for Brainfeeder everywhere outside the US. In April 2010, Sheffield-born producer and DJ Toddla T (who had originally arrived at Ninja having produced parts of Roots Manuva&#x27;s 2008 album, &quot;Slime &amp; Reason&quot;, which reached number 22 in the UK Charts) also signed his Girls Music record label to Ninja Tune for distribution, manufacturing, and marketing, in addition to signing a three-album deal. In June 2012, Ninja announced a partnership with underground artist Actress and his Werkdiscs imprint, home to Zomby&#x27;s &quot;Where Were U in 92?&quot;, Actress&#x27;s &quot;Hazyville&quot;, and various records by Lukid and Lone.

Also in 2010, Bonobo&#x27;s own &quot;Black Sands&quot; album marked his fourth full-length. It pushed Bonobo&#x27;s sound &quot;much more steeped in beat-making, creating deluxe, post-dance soundscapes&quot;, and achieved worldwide commercial success. In February 2012, Ninja followed up with a remix album, &quot;Black Sands Remixed&quot;, which featured re-imaginings from producers such as Lapalux, Mark Pritchard, Machinedrum and FaltyDL.

A couple of months before, in November 2011, New York producer FaltyDL had made his debut on the Ninja roster with his &quot;Atlantis&quot; EP, a &quot;smoother and shuffler&quot; ride than most of his earlier work. His work for Ninja was deemed &quot;calm and focused, a trend that continued on his third album&quot;, &quot;Hardcourage&quot;, released in January 2012. Ruth Saxelby with Pitchfork said the album was &quot;sure-footed and big-hearted, accessible and yet cerebral.&quot;

Jaga Jazzist returned in 2010 with their strongest release to date, &quot;One-Armed Bandit&quot;, which featured new members within Jaga Jazzist&#x27;s ranks and included &quot;tropical polyrhythms, modernist patterns, and even techno-inspired synth sequences.&quot;

Another release that pushed Ninja to new sonic territories came from London-based artist Floating Points at the end of 2010 with &#x27;Post Suite / Almost in Profile&#x27;. The Floating Points Ensemble is an instrumental ensemble headed by himself on Fender Rhodes and Sequential Circuits Pro One and Prophet keyboards. The double A-side 10&quot; vinyl single featured two tracks by the full Ensemble, recorded and mixed at Abbey Road Studios for the Ninja Tune XX twentieth anniversary celebration.

In 2010, a sound designer from Berlin (by way of Bristol), Emika, brought a new sound to the label, with her melodic, R&amp;B tinged bass-heavy &#x27;Double Edge.&#x27; Her self-titled debut was later released in 2011, Billboard said that Emika came close to &quot;bridging the minimalist menace&quot; of Bristol dubstep to &quot; breathy accessible vocals and classical piano.&quot; On her 2013 follow-up, &#x27;DVA,&#x27; Emika shifted her song writing style, focusing on political and personal themes.

In March 2011, another exploratory bass cadet – Dorian Concept – released his first Ninja EP, &quot;Her Tears Taste Like Pears&quot;. It proved to be a &quot;solid example of the kind of genius Concept, himself something of a child piano prodigy, is capable of.&quot;

The following May saw the release of a much-awaited album from Amon Tobin, &quot;ISAM&quot;, which set a new benchmark for live electronic music. Tobin decided to step away from previous DJ centric performances, and instead provided a large-scale live audio/visual experience to select cities around the world. Developed alongside V Squared Labs, Leviathan, Vello Virkhaus &amp; Matt Daly, Alex Lazarus, Vitamotus Design Studio, and Stefano Novelli, the show featured a 25&#x27; x 14&#x27; x 8&#x27; multi-dimensional/ shape shifting 3D art installation surrounding Tobin and enveloping him and the audience in a 3D experience. Tobin conceptualized the show as a projection-mapped &quot;visual score&quot; to the music from &quot;ISAM&quot;. The show completed a sold-out 15-show run through US and Canada, in addition to five sold-out UK/EU shows. In 2012, ISAM Live returned with a larger tour, starting at Coachella and traveling to Sydney Opera House, London&#x27;s Brixton Academy, New York&#x27;s Hammerstein Ballroom, Greek Theatre (Los Angeles), Sonar (Barcelona), as well as full European and US tours throughout summer and fall. In May 2012, Ninja Tune released an Amon Tobin box set (7 × CD, 2 × DVD, 6 × Vinyl, 10&quot;).

At the beginning of 2012, Speech Debelle returned to Big Dada, after much critical speculation about leaving the label. She returned from her Mercury Prize win to release another critically acclaimed album, &#x27;Freedom of Speech.&#x27; According to Scottish magazine The Skinny, this album had &quot;a verve and vigor that more than justify the early hype.&quot; The &quot;refreshingly outspoken&quot; album went on to &quot;trounce all expectations&quot; and was awarded CD of the week by Evening Standard.

In 2009, Ninja&#x27;s longest-serving artist, DJ Food a.k.a. Strictly Kev, released the 2009 EP &#x27;One Man&#x27;s Weird Is Another Man&#x27;s World,&#x27; and its 2010 follow-up &#x27;The Shape of Things That Hum&#x27; made up two-thirds of a forthcoming album. In January 2012, &#x27;The Search Engine&#x27; was released as the first DJ Food album in 11 years. As an album release event, DJ Food created his most ambitious live gig to date: a bespoke AV live show for London&#x27;s only public planetarium, in conjunction with astronomers from The Royal Observatory Greenwich, using art from The Search Engine, images from Kev&#x27;s visual archive, plus a wealth of material provided by the astronomers themselves. Kev adapted his content to fit Montreal&#x27;s Stratosphere in July.

In mid-2012, The Bug announced that after &quot;London Zoo,&quot; he set out a new genre and sub-label with Ninja Tune: Acid Ragga. Releasing a set of 7&quot;s, in June the first Bug track – &quot;Can&#x27;t Take This No More&quot; – unleashed featuring the legendary Daddy Freddy, while on the flip &quot;Rise&quot; featured Inga Copeland of Hype Williams. The &quot;Ganja Baby&quot; 7-inch was released shortly afterward, featuring Daddy Freddy, followed by the 2 x 10&quot; Filthy EP featuring rapper Danny Brown and long-time collaborator Flowdan.

In August 2012, London-based band The Invisible dropped their second album, the &quot;cerebral yet instantly accessible&quot; &#x27;Rispah,&#x27; on Ninja Tune, having been recorded in Brighton – with producer Richard File. The trio&#x27;s self-titled debut album (produced by Matthew Herbert) in 2009 was nominated for the Mercury Prize and selected as critics choice for iTunes album of the year. The band&#x27;s tongue-in-cheek definition of their style of music is &#x27;Experimental Genre-Spanning Spacepop&#x27;.

In 2012, Ninja Tune also struck a deal with the game developer United Front Games and their publisher Square Enix for their game &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot;. Ninja Tune was featured as an in-game radio channel available to the player during gameplay, one of the ten total. The station featured a select group of works by the real-life Ninja Tune record and their then-artist lineup, including works by Bonobo, Lorn, Emika, Stateless, Two Fingers, and Cinematic Orchestra among others, for a total of 18 tracks.

Ninja Tune scored well at Gilles Peterson&#x27;s Worldwide Awards 2013, with Brainfeeder winning &quot;Label of the Year&quot; – and Ninja Tune scoring 2nd – with the public vote. Invisible&#x27;s &quot;Rispah&quot; also won Album of the Year.

In typical pioneering fashion, in February 2013, Ninja Tune spearheaded the launch of Beat Delete – a new service for out-of-press vinyl. The demise of Sony DADC warehouse in Edmonton (destroyed during the London riots in the summer of 2011), left many independent labels ravaged. Ninja Tune launched a website Beat Delete as a pledge scheme enabling fans to partially fund the release of rare collectibles.

In April 2013, Coldcut released Ninja Jamm, an iOS music remix app, in collaboration with London-based arts and technology firm Seeper. Geared toward both casual listeners and more experienced DJs and music producers, the freemium app allows users to download and remix &quot;Tunepacks&quot; that feature original tracks and mixes by Coldcut, as well as other Ninja artists, creating something new altogether. With what Billboard called the &quot;intuitive yet deep&quot; remixer, users can turn instruments on and off, swap between clips, add glitches and effects, trigger and pitch-bend stabs and one-off samples, and change the tempo of the track instantly. Users can additionally record as they mix and instantly upload to SoundCloud or save the mixes locally. Tunepack releases for Ninja Jamm are increasingly synchronized with Ninja Tune releases on conventional formats. To date over 20 tune packs have been released, including Amon Tobin, Bonobo, Coldcut, DJ Food, Martyn, Emika, Machinedrum, Raffertie, Irresistible Force, Falty DL.

In March 2013, Bonobo unleashed his highly anticipated follow-up to &quot;Black Sands&quot;, the triumphant and revelatory &quot;The North Borders&quot;. Hailed as being sumptuous and accomplished, the album featured Erykah Badu, Motion Audio artist Grey Reverend, British singer Szjerdene and Swedish singer-songwriter Cornelia. Visual artist Cyriak&#x27;s video for Bonobo&#x27;s &quot;Cirrus&quot; was a cascading visual mantra that hit over 1 million views. The album charted at number 29 on the UK Album Charts. The following November, Bonobo released his contribution to the &quot;Late Night Tales&quot; series with a 21-track selection, which Bonobo described as ranging &quot;from neo-classical to more abstract electronic pieces to spiritual jazz.&quot; Bonobo&#x27;s popularity in the live spectrum continues to grow, having sold out a Roundhouse Ninja Tune festival in 2013 and Sydney Opera House. He has a live performance scheduled at Alexandra Palace in November 2014.

Another popular Ninja Tune artist, Travis Stewart, a.k.a. NYC/Berlin artist Machinedrum signed up with the label in 2013, first releasing &quot;Eyesdontlie&quot; that July, a single which XLR8R donned &quot;quite possibly deeper and more ambitious than anything we&#x27;ve heard from Stewart to date.&quot; After releasing a second 12&quot; (&quot;Gunshotta Ave&quot;) the following month, Machinedrum released his full LP &quot;Vapor City&quot; at the end of September 2013. With Pitchfork calling the album &quot;visceral,&quot; it is n album about an imaginary metropolis, &quot;Vapor City&quot; received much acclaim from critics and DJs alike, even landing three live performances on the Boiler Room (New York, Berlin, and London). Machinedrum claimed it was his biggest and boldest project to date.

In January 2014, Big Dada released a deluxe European edition of Killer Mike and El-P&#x27;s Run the Jewels album, featuring new artwork, a new colour vinyl LP + 12&quot; release plus deluxe CD and download editions.

Ninja Tune also released Actress&#x27; fourth album, &quot;Ghettoville&quot; in January 2014. The exquisite

In May 2014, &quot;UK festival favorite&quot; Mr. Scruff released his fifth LP on Ninja Tune, entitled &quot;Friendly Bacteria&quot;. Meanwhile, The Bug is continuing his series of &quot;Acid Ragga&quot; singles throughout 2014, leading up to his next full-length later in the year, &quot;Angels &amp; Devils&quot;. Names that The Bug has worked with on the project (in addition to Inga Copeland and Daddy Freddy) include Death Grips, Gonjasufi, Grouper, JK Flesh (Godflesh/Jesu), The Spaceape, Flowdan, Warrior Queen and Earth&#x27;s Dylan Carlson.

On 2 November 2014, Young Fathers&#x27; &quot;Dead&quot; entered the official Top 100 UK album chart for the first time, four days after their Mercury success, debuting at 35.

On 30 October 2015, Big Dada&#x27;s Roots Manuva released his 9th studio album entitled &quot;Bleeds&quot;, receiving positive reviews in most publications, currently holding an 80% score on Metacritic.

Kamasi Washington debut solo recording, &quot;The Epic&quot;, was released in May 2015 via Flying Lotus&#x27; Brainfeeder to critical acclaim. It appeared on numerous &#x27;Best of 2015&#x27; lists, including publications such as NPR Music, The Guardian, Pitchfork, Vice&#x27;s Noisey, MOJO, Uncut, Rolling Stone and many more.

Bonobo released his sixth album, &quot;Migration&quot;, in January 2017. It was announced on 3 November 2016 with the release of the single &quot;Kerala&quot; and an official video. The official video for the single is directed by Bison (Jon Hopkins/London Grammar/Rosie Lowe), featuring lead Gemma Arterton (&quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;/&quot;Inside No. 9&quot;). The album artwork was designed by Neil Krug (Boards of Canada/Lana Del Rey). The album features Nick Murphy, Rhye, Innov Gnawa and Hundred Waters. The album and the track &quot;Bambro Koyo Ganda&quot; were nominated for the 60th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Dance Recording and Best Dance/Electronic Album. The album peaked higher in the UK chart (number 5) and in the US (number 59). In 2018, Bonobo&#x27;s &quot;Migration&quot; album also won Album of the Year at the 2017 Electronic Music Awards and Bonobo was also nominated for Live Act of the Year. Around the release of the album, Bonobo performed sold-out shows at venues such as Brixton Academy and Alexandra Palace.

On 19 May 2017, Ninja Tune Founders Coldcut and Adrian Sherwood released their collaborative debut album &quot;Outside The Echo Chamber&quot; via Ninja imprint Ahead of Our Time. Collaborators that featured on the album included Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry, Roots Manuva, Junior Reid, Ce&#x27;Cile, Sugar Hill Gang alumni Skip McDonald and Doug Wimbish on Guitar and Bass respectively and production from Toddla T.

In 2017 Ahead of Our Time released the album &quot;Stories From Far Away on Piano&quot; by James Heather, and also released its follow-up in 2022, the album &quot;Invisible Forces&quot;.

After signing to Ninja Tune in 2017, Belfast-based duo Bicep released their long-awaited debut album &quot;Bicep&quot;, which reached the Top 20 of the UK Album Charts and received positive reviews on its release, with support from publications such as Pitchfork, The Guardian, Resident Advisor and a cover feature on Mixmag. They went on to play a sold-out show at London&#x27;s Roundhouse.

Young Fathers&#x27; third studio album, &quot;Cocoa Sugar,&quot; was announced with the single &quot;In My View&quot; on 17 January 2018. The album was released to critical acclaim on 9 March 2018. The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number 28, making it the band&#x27;s highest-charting album. Due to their support of Palestinians through the BDS movement, the band was dropped from the 2018 Ruhrtriennale line-up.

Berlin based South Korean Dj and Producer Peggy Gou released her EP &quot;Once&quot; in March 2018, with lead single &quot;It Makes You Forget (Itgehane)&quot;, on which she sings in Korean, receiving widespread radio play on stations like BBC Radio 1, BBC 6 Music and more. This earned Peggy a place on the publication Dazed&#x27;s top 100 artists of the year.

Following the release of the &#x27;Audio Track 5&#x27; EP and live performances at the Strelka Institute (Moscow), Barbican Centre and the Tate Modern, electronic producer and musician Darren Cunningham AKA Actress and the London Contemporary Orchestra released a full album of their collaboration on 25 May 2018 entitled &#x27;LAGEOS&#x27;.

The subsidiary label Technicolour released Yu Su&#x27;s &quot;Watermelon Woman&quot; EP in 2019.

==Design==
As the imprint grew, Ninja became an &#x27;anti-corporate&#x27; brand, supporting the work of visual artists, filmmakers, and mavericks of all media through running its club nights and helping disseminate the work of its artists across the globe. From its very beginnings, Ninja Tune sought a strong visual identity. This is in part due to Michael Bartalos (whose original logo was a monochrome woodcut of a hooded ninja brandishing his long sword) and Mark Porter, Matt Black&#x27;s friend from Oxford, Ninja&#x27;s first art director who defined the logo and overall aesthetic (in addition to creating Ninja&#x27;s striking yellow and black in-house record bags), and subsequently became Art Director at The Guardian. It was the arrival of Kevin Foakes as an in-house designer in 1994 that developed the logo to its current international recognition and became largely responsible for some of the label&#x27;s most iconic artwork. Working as Openmind, Foakes has designed many of Ninja&#x27;s album sleeves, including memorable covers for Amon Tobin, Coldcut, and Funki Porcini&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;Fast Asleep&quot;. He&#x27;s also commissioned acclaimed outside talent for several key projects.

Foakes&#x27; Ninja logo has found its way in diverse remix forms onto DJ bags (the &quot;Wax Sack&quot;), cigarette lighters, T-shirts, turntable slip-mats, iPod skins (bearing the slogan &quot;Remember vinyl?&quot;), sunglasses by Japanese company Less Than Human and the label&#x27;s brand of cigarette rolling papers (&quot;Ninja Skins&quot;). French urban vinyl specialists Rolito also marketed a Foakes-designed toy Ninja, who came armed with a 3&quot; CD of Ninja Tunes.

Ewan Robertson (a.k.a. Offshore) and Oscar Bauer, were integral co-designers for Ninja Tune or Big Dada, responsible for iconic covers such as the |Playtime Is Over]]&quot;, the Roots Manuva slime-head for &quot;Slime &amp; Reason&quot; and Bonobo&#x27;s &quot;Black Sands&quot; triptych.

Some Ninja Tune artists, meanwhile, design their sleeves. One example is Mr. Scruff, whose cartoon illustrations are emblazoned across much of his catalog and merchandise. Another prodigious cartoonist who designs his sleeves is Kid Koala. Kid Koala&#x27;s &quot;Nufonia Must Fall&quot; graphic novel, published in 2003 by ECW Press in association with Ninja Tune, 2000 debut album, &quot;Carpal Tunnel Syndrome&quot;, and its 2003 follow-up &quot;Some of My Best Friends Are DJs&quot; came accompanied by Koala-illustrated comic books.

Other unique promotional Ninja Tune items include Coldcut&#x27;s Top Trump-inspired &quot;Control Cards&quot;, Amon Tobin ear-plugs, Kid Koala-illustrated playing cards, Mr. Scruff-designed jigsaw puzzles, Scruff-branded tins of tuna-in-brine (to promote his 2008 LP &quot;Ninja Tuna&quot;, which was available pre-loaded on a tuna-shaped USB stick), The Heavy and TTC-branded condoms, and plastic travelcard wallets emblazoned with artwork from Big Dada&#x27;s &quot;Well Deep&quot; compilation and Roots Manuva&#x27;s &quot;Slime &amp; Reason&quot; album.

As part of Ninja Tune&#x27;s 20th Anniversary in 2010, 3500 Ninja Tune XX box sets were released, all housed in limited edition hi-spec packaging designed and conceived by Ninja artwork legend Openmind. In May 2013, golden ticket holders for Bonobo&#x27;s Camden Roundhouse gig in London were given a limited edition 12&quot; for Bonobo&#x27;s &quot;Cirrus&quot;, which came in a gatefold plastic cover with &quot;zoetrope&quot; viewer stand and art print, with picture disc art by Cyriak. In January 2014, Werkdiscs boss Actress released a boxset for a collection of photos presented by Hard Format, which included &quot;Ghettoville&quot; as vinyl and CD, as well as—for the first time on vinyl—a 2 LP white vinyl edition of &quot;Hazyville&quot; and CD. The box set also contained a 40-page art book, all carefully encased in a black &quot;elephant-skinned&quot; outer box.

Bonobo has collaborated with art director Leif Podhajsky and photographer Pelle Crépin to create covers for some of his albums. The cover of his 2010 album &quot;Black Sands&quot; was designed by design studio Oscar &amp; Ewan and features an image taken by Crépin. The three cover photographs form a triptych around Derwentwater in the Lake District. They were taken at each point on the map with each view capturing the place of the next photograph and the last photograph capturing the place of the first. The abstract cover for Bonobo&#x27;s 2013 follow-up album The North Borders was created by Leif Podhajsky using a polaroid image of a wave. Podhajsky also provides the artwork for Bonobo&#x27;s Flashlight EP in 2014, its cover art is a gold lava effect forming the inside sleeve glimpsed through tiny holes in a dark grey die-cut cover for the vinyl product. Leif Podhajsky again collaborated with Ninja Tune on the artwork for Kelis&#x27; 2014 album &quot;Food&quot;.

For the release of Bonobo&#x27;s sixth album &quot;Migration&quot; in January 2017, the album artwork was designed by Neil Krug. The physical artwork included photography of the Mojave Desert, with Krug capturing footage using a drone. This drone footage would come to form the video for &quot;Break Apart feat. Rhye&quot;. He drove to the desert in the middle of the night to photograph the area just before sunrise, avoiding the sun&#x27;s intense heat. The shots were then superimposed with various effects such as flames. The LP was accompanied by a special edition booklet containing meditations on themes from the album, the deluxe version housed in a gold-embossed PVC sleeve.

In 2017, Belfast-based duo Bicep released their debut album &quot;Bicep&quot;, with artwork created by design team Royal Studio in partnership with AnaTypes Type, Xesta Studio and Lyft Studio. Photographs of textures were digitally transformed, modulated, coloured, gridded, and gridded over and over again in hundreds of different formations. These arrangements of textures in different colourways were then sent to Bicep, who would select their highlights from each.

The artwork for Young Fathers&#x27; 2018 album &quot;Cocoa Sugar&quot; was created by photographer Noni Julia &amp; creative director Tom Hingston.

== Partnerships ==

===Solid Steel===
Pre-dating Ninja Tune is the radio show Solid Steel, set up by Coldcut in 1988, and later joined by DJ Food and DK. What initially began as a radio show on then-pirate Kiss FM went on to become a weekly 2-hour mix show broadcast online and syndicated to numerous radio stations around the world, with highlights available as a podcast on iTunes. Solid Steel is also the name of a series of DJ mix CDs from the label and various club nights showcasing the talents of the Solid Steel DJs and several Ninja Tune artists.

The show, which celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2013, showcases a varied blend of left-field tunes, the broadest beats, and forward-thinking selections. Being a freestyle eclectic mix, the weekly two-hour show was described by The Quietus as being &quot;the past mashed with the present plus a dash of the future.&quot;

In addition to Solid Steel, Ninja Tune has conducted regularly podcast interviews with their roster under the name &quot;The Ninja Tune Podcast&quot;.

===Big Dada===
Hip hop label Big Dada was set up by journalist and writer Will Ashon in 1997. Big Dada was created with a similarly open-minded remit to sister label Ninja Tune, traversing the boundaries between hip hop, grime and ragga. Born out of frustration over acts going unappreciated elsewhere, Big Dada swiftly cemented itself as a force in its own right. The name came up about Ashton&#x27;s love of Kool Keith, who he had described in print as the &quot;Mac Dada&quot;, as a combination of mac daddy and Dadaism.

Big Dada began releasing 12&quot;&#x27;s in the summer of 1997, the first couple of which were produced by Luke Vibert. The label&#x27;s debut release, &quot;Misanthropic&quot;, featured Alpha Prhyme, a.k.a. Juice Aleem, soon to become a member of crew New Flesh for Old, who would release their own &quot;Electronic Bombardment&quot; on Big Dada that September. Since then, Big Dada has become home to some of the most maverick, forward-thinking, and innovative artists in hip hop and beyond, including essential British hip hop artist Roots Manuva (Mercury Prize nominee), Mercury Prize winner Speech Debelle, UK hip hop artist TY (whose 2003 &quot;Upwards&quot; album was also Mercury nominated). Roots Manuva&#x27;s album releases have been integral to the label, including &quot;Brand New Second Hand&quot;, &quot;Run Come Save Me&quot;, &quot;Awfully Deep&quot;, &quot;Slime &amp; Reason&quot; and &quot;4everevolution&quot;. Other notable artists include Diplo, cLOUDDEAD, Juice Aleem, DELS, Young Fathers (Mercury Prize Winner 2014), and Spank Rock, with a roster that&#x27;s as prolific as it is varied. In the words of The Guardian, &quot;Heaven help the music hack who tries to pigeonhole Big Dada&#x27;s output.&quot;

In 2021, the label was relaunched as &quot;a label run by Black, POC &amp; Minority Ethnic people for Black, POC &amp; Minority Ethnic artists.&quot;

===Brainfeeder===
Brainfeeder is an independent record label based in Los Angeles, California, founded by Warp Records recording artist Flying Lotus in 2008, focusing on electronic music and instrumental hip hop amongst other styles of music.

===Werkdiscs===
Werkdiscs (formerly spelled as Werk Discs) is a British independent record label based in London. Originally a club night started by Darren J. Cunningham a.k.a. Actress, Ben Casey and Gavin Weale in the early 2000s,[11] Werkdiscs released their first record in the summer of 2004.

===Ntone===
Ntone, Ninja Tune&#x27;s first sister label, debuted in 1994, specializing in avant-garde music and more electronically inclined ambiance. Animals on Wheels, Cabbageboy, Hexstatic and Neotropic were among the artists on the bill. According to Peter Quicke, Ntone was &quot;for ambient and techno and other stuff that did not quite fit Ninja Tune, but that we liked and did not want to limit ourselves from releasing.&quot; The earliest release, &quot;AntiStatic&quot; (TONE 1) by Hex in February 1994, and the final, &quot;Sunflower&quot; &quot;Girl&quot; (NTONE 45) by Neotropic in 2001, were a collision of spacey dub and mellow ambient house.

<text>The New International Version (NIV) is a translation of the Bible into contemporary English. Published by Biblica, the complete NIV was released on October 27, 1978 with a minor revision in 1984 and a major revision in 2011. The NIV relies on recently-published critical editions of the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts.

Biblica claims that &quot;the NIV delivers the very best combination of accuracy and readability.&quot; As of March 2013, over 450 million printed copies of the translation had been distributed. The NIV is the best-selling translation in the United States.

== History ==
===Beginnings===
In 1955, businessman Howard Long was convinced of the need for a contemporary English translation of the Bible while sharing the gospel with a business associate. He was unhappy with the King James Version that he used to communicate the gospel and was frustrated with its archaic language. He thought, &quot;Everywhere I go, in Canada, the U.S., anywhere, there are people who would like to read their Bible to their children at night. And they don&#x27;t have something the children can grasp.&quot; He shared the frustration with his pastor, Reverend Peter DeJong. Inspired by the need for a Bible in contemporary English, the two men petitioned their denomination, Christian Reformed Church (CRC). After initial rejection and deferral, the CRC endorsed a committee to investigate the issue in 1957.

The NIV began with the formation of a small committee to study the value of producing a translation in the common language of the American people and a project of the National Association of Evangelicals in 1957. In 1964, a joint committee of representatives from the Christian Reformed Church and National Association of Evangelicals issued invitations to a translation conference, which met in August 1965 at Trinity Christian College in Palos Heights, Illinois, and made two key decisions. The first was that &quot;a contemporary English translation of the Bible should be undertaken as a collegiate endeavor of evangelical scholars.&quot; The second was that a &quot;continuing committee of fifteen&quot; should be established to move the work forward. The &quot;committee of fifteen&quot; was ultimately named the Committee on Bible Translation (CBT), and the &quot;Contemporary English Translation&quot; became the NIV. 

In 1967, the New York Bible Society (now called Biblica) took responsibility for the project and hired a team of 15 scholars from various Evangelical Christian denominations and from various countries. The initial &quot;Committee on Bible Translation&quot; consisted of Leslie Carlson, Edmund Clowney, Ralph Earle, Jr., Burton L. Goddard, R. Laird Harris, Earl S. Kalland, Kenneth Kantzer, Robert H. Mounce, Charles F. Pfeiffer, Charles Caldwell Ryrie, Francis R. Steele, John H. Stek, J. C. Wenger, Stephen W. Paine, and Marten Woudstra. The New Testament was released in 1973 and the full Bible in 1978. A UK version was also released to accommodate differences between American English and British English. 

The NIV underwent a minor revision in 1984.

=== Inclusive-language editions ===
In 1995, a new version of the New Testament and Psalms was published in the UK, and the full Bible followed in 1996 as the &quot;New International Version Inclusive Language Edition&quot;, but it was not published in the US because of opposition from conservative evangelical groups there to gender-neutral language. A further edition with minor edits was published in 1999.

A revised English edition, &quot;Today&#x27;s New International Version&quot; (TNIV), again used gender-neutral language and was released as a New Testament in March 2002, with the complete Bible being published in February 2005.

=== 2011 update ===
In 2011, an updated version of the NIV was released, with both the 1984 version and the TNIV being discontinued.

The update modified and dropped some of the gender-neutral language compared to TNIV, which included going back to using &quot;mankind&quot; and &quot;man,&quot; rather than &quot;human beings&quot; and &quot;people.&quot; Keith Danby, the president and chief executive officer of Biblica, speaking of the TNIV, said that they had failed to convince people that revisions were needed and that they had underestimated their readers&#x27; loyalty to the 1984 edition.

=== Derivative versions ===
==== Plain English version (NIrV) ====
An easier to read version, &quot;New International Reader&#x27;s Version&quot; (NIrV), was published in 1996. It was written at a third-grade reading level, to enable those with limited English literacy levels, the ability to read the Bible.

==== Spanish version (NVI) ====
In 1979, the decision was made to produce a version of the New Testament in Spanish with the title La Santa Biblia, Nueva Versión Internacional (often abbreviated NVI), but that version was based only on the former English translation of the historic manuscripts. In 1990, the committee on Bible translation headed by Drs. René Padilla and Luciano Jaramillo conducted a translation of both testaments from the historic manuscripts directly into Spanish, bypassed English altogether, and produced a complete Spanish NVI Bible in 1999.

==== Portuguese version (NVI) ====
In 2001, the Nova Versão Internacional in Portuguese was published.

== Textual basis ==
The manuscript base for the Old Testament was the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia Masoretic Hebrew Text. Other ancient texts consulted were the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Septuagint, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Aquila, Symmachus and Theodotion, the Latin Vulgate, the Syriac Peshitta, the Aramaic Targum, and, for the Psalms, the Juxta Hebraica of Jerome. The manuscript base for the New Testament was the Koine Greek language editions of the United Bible Societies and of Nestle-Aland. The deuterocanonical books are not included in the translation.

== Translation methodology ==
The core translation group consisted of fifteen Biblical scholars using Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts whose goal was to produce a more modern English language text than the King James Version. The translation took ten years and involved a team of over 100 scholars from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The range of those participating included many different denominations such as Anglican, Catholic, Assemblies of God, Baptist, Christian Reformed, Lutheran and Presbyterian.

The NIV is a balance between word-for-word and thought-for-thought or literal and phrase-by-phrase translations.

Recent archaeological and linguistic discoveries helped in understanding passages that have traditionally been difficult to translate. Familiar spellings of traditional translations were generally retained.

== Reception ==
According to the Association for Christian Retail (CBA), the New International Version has become the most popular selling English translation of the Bible in CBA bookstores, having sold more than 450 million copies worldwide.

There are numerous study Bibles available with extensive notes on the text and background information to make the Biblical stories more comprehensible. Among these are the &quot;NIV Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible&quot;, &quot;Concordia Study Bible&quot;, the Zondervan published &quot;NIV Study Bible&quot;, the Wesleyan revision, &quot;Reflecting God Study Bible&quot;, as well as the &quot;Life Application Study Bible&quot;.

In 2009, the New Testament scholar N. T. Wright wrote that the NIV obscured what Paul the Apostle was saying and ensured that Paul&#x27;s words conformed to Protestant and Evangelical tradition. He claimed, &quot;if a church only, or mainly, relies on the NIV it will, quite simply, never understand what Paul was talking about,&quot; especially in Galatians and Romans.

In support of that claim, Wright specifically mentioned several verses of Romans 3, which he suggested not to convey how &quot;righteousness&quot; refers to the covenant faithfulness of God or reflect his own thinking about the &quot;pistis Christou&quot; debate. All editions of the NIV have given &quot;God&#x27;s Faithfulness&quot; as the heading for Romans 3:1–8. Wright&#x27;s specific objections concerning verses later in the chapter no longer apply to the 2011 revision of the NIV, which moreover offers &quot;the faithfulness of Jesus Christ&quot; as an alternative translation to &quot;faith in Jesus Christ&quot; in Romans 3:22.

Mark Given, a professor of religious studies at Missouri State University, criticized the NIV for &quot;several inaccurate and misleading translations&quot; since many sentences and clauses are paraphrased, rather than translated from Hebrew and Greek.

Michael Marlowe, a scholar in biblical languages, criticized as &quot;indefensible&quot; the footnote provided in the NIV for , which replaced multiple instances of &quot;head covering&quot; with &quot;long hair&quot; to &quot;harmonize this passage with modern habits of dress.&quot; Church historian David Bercot, whose focus is early Christianity, likewise deemed the footnote a &quot;fanciful interpretation&quot; that &quot;is in no way an alternate translation of the Greek text.&quot;

Others have also criticized the NIV. In Genesis 2:19, a translation such as the New Revised Standard Version uses &quot;formed&quot; in the simple past tense: &quot;So out of the ground the LORD God every animal.&quot; Some have questioned the NIV&#x27;s choice to use the pluperfect: &quot;Now the LORD God out of the ground all the wild animals&quot; to try to make it appear that the animals had already been created. Theologian John Sailhamer stated, &quot;Not only is such a translation[...] hardly possible[...] but it misses the very point of the narrative, namely, that the animals were created in response to God&#x27;s declaration that it was not good that the man should be alone.&quot;

Biblical scholar Bruce M. Metzger criticized the NIV 1984 edition for the addition of &quot;just&quot; into Jeremiah 7:22 in which the verse becomes &quot;For when I brought your forefathers/ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I did not &quot;just&quot; give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices.&quot; Metzger also criticized the addition of &quot;your&quot; into Matthew 13:32, which becomes &quot;Though it the mustard seed] is the smallest of all &quot;your&quot; seeds.&quot; The word &quot;your&quot; was removed from that verse in the 2011 revision.

=== 2011 revision ===
Professor of New Testament Studies Daniel B. Wallace praised the 2011 update and called it &quot;a well-thought out translation, with checks and balances through rigorous testing, overlapping committees to ensure consistency and accuracy, and a publisher willing to commit significant resources to make this Bible appealing to the Christian reader.&quot; The Southern Baptist Convention rejected the 2011 update because of gender-neutral language although the update had dropped some gender-neutral language of the 2005 revision.

Southern Baptist publisher LifeWay declined the Southern Baptist Convention&#x27;s censor request to remove the NIV from its stores. While the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod rejected its use, some in the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) believe many of the translations changes are right and defensible.

Professor of New Testament Studies Rodney J. Decker wrote in the &quot;Themelios Journal&quot; review of the NIV 2011:
By taking a mediating position between formal and functional equivalence (though tending, I think, closer to the formal end of the spectrum), the NIV has been able to produce a text that is clearer than many translations, especially those weighted more heavily with formal equivalence... If we are serious about making the word of God a vital tool in the lives of English-speaking Christians, then we must aim for a translation that communicates clearly in the language of the average English-speaking person. It is here that the NIV excels. It not only communicates the meaning of God&#x27;s revelation accurately, but does so in English that is easily understood by a wide range of English speakers. It is as well-suited for expository preaching as it is for public reading and use in Bible classes and children&#x27;s ministries.

<doc id="21736" wikidata="Q7320" url="?curid=21736" title="Nazi Party">
<text>The Nazi Party, officially the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party ( or NSDAP), was a far-right political party in Germany active between 1920 and 1945 that created and supported the ideology of Nazism. Its precursor, the German Workers&#x27; Party (; DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920. The Nazi Party emerged from the extremist German nationalist (&quot;&quot;Völkisch&quot; nationalist&quot;), racist, and populist paramilitary culture, which fought against communist uprisings in post–World War I Germany. The party was created to draw workers away from communism and into nationalism. Initially, Nazi political strategy focused on anti-big business, anti-bourgeoisie, and anti-capitalism, disingenuously using socialist rhetoric to gain the support of the lower middle class; it was later downplayed to gain the support of business leaders. By the 1930s, the party&#x27;s main focus shifted to antisemitic and anti-Marxist themes. The party had little popular support until the Great Depression, when worsening living standards and widespread unemployment drove Germans into political extremism.

Central to Nazism were themes of racial segregation expressed in the idea of a &quot;people&#x27;s community&quot; (). The party aimed to unite &quot;racially desirable&quot; Germans as national comrades while excluding those deemed to be either political dissidents, physically or intellectually inferior, or of a foreign race (). The Nazis sought to strengthen the Germanic people, the &quot;Aryan master race&quot;, through racial purity and eugenics, broad social welfare programs, and a collective subordination of individual rights, which could be sacrificed for the good of the state on behalf of the people. To protect the supposed purity and strength of the Aryan race, the Nazis sought to disenfranchise, segregate, and eventually exterminate Jews, Romani, Slavs, the physically and mentally disabled, homosexuals, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and political opponents. The persecution reached its climax when the party-controlled German state set in motion the Final Solution – an industrial system of genocide that carried out mass murders of around 6 million Jews and millions of other targeted victims in what has become known as the Holocaust.

Adolf Hitler, the party&#x27;s leader since 1921, was appointed Chancellor of Germany by President Paul von Hindenburg on 30 January 1933, and quickly seized power afterwards. Hitler established a totalitarian regime known as the Third Reich and became dictator with absolute power. 

Following the military defeat of Germany in World War II, the party was declared illegal. The Allies attempted to purge German society of Nazi elements in a process known as denazification. Several top leaders were tried and found guilty of crimes against humanity in the Nuremberg trials, and executed. The use of symbols associated with the party is still outlawed in many European countries, including Germany and Austria.
== Name ==
The renaming of the German Worker&#x27;s Party (DAP) to the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (NSDAP) was partially driven by a desire to draw upon both left-wing and right-wing ideals, with &quot;Socialist&quot; and &quot;Workers&#x27;&quot; appealing to the left, and &quot;National&quot; and &quot;German&quot; appealing to the right. , the informal and originally derogatory term for a party member, abbreviates the party&#x27;s name ( ), and was coined in analogy with (pronounced ), an abbreviation of (member of the rival Social Democratic Party of Germany). Members of the party referred to themselves as (National Socialists), but some did occasionally embrace the colloquial (so Leopold von Mildenstein in his article series &quot;Ein Nazi fährt nach Palästina&quot; published in in 1934). The term (party member) was commonly used among Nazis, with its corresponding feminine form .

Before the rise of the party, these terms had been used as colloquial and derogatory words for a backward peasant, or an awkward and clumsy person. It derived from Ignaz, a shortened version of Ignatius, which was a common name in the Nazis&#x27; home region of Bavaria. Opponents seized on this, and the long-existing , to attach a dismissive nickname to the National Socialists.

In 1933, when Adolf Hitler assumed power in the German government, the usage of &quot;Nazi&quot; diminished in Germany, although Austrian anti-Nazis continued to use the term. The use of &quot;Nazi Germany&quot; and &quot;Nazi regime&quot; was popularised by anti-Nazis and German exiles abroad. Thereafter, the term spread into other languages and eventually was brought back to Germany after World War II. In English, the term is not considered slang and has such derivatives as Nazism and denazification.

== History ==
=== Origins and early years: 1918–1923 ===
The Nazi Party grew out of smaller political groups with a nationalist orientation that formed in the last years of World War I. In 1918, a league called the (Free Workers&#x27; Committee for a good Peace) was created in Bremen, Germany. On 7 March 1918, Anton Drexler, an avid German nationalist, formed a branch of this league in Munich. Drexler was a local locksmith who had been a member of the militarist Fatherland Party during World War I and was bitterly opposed to the armistice of November 1918 and the revolutionary upheavals that followed. Drexler followed the views of militant nationalists of the day, such as opposing the Treaty of Versailles, having antisemitic, anti-monarchist and anti-Marxist views, as well as believing in the superiority of Germans whom they claimed to be part of the Aryan &quot;master race&quot; (). However, he also accused international capitalism of being a Jewish-dominated movement and denounced capitalists for war profiteering in World War I. Drexler saw the political violence and instability in Germany as the result of the Weimar Republic being out-of-touch with the masses, especially the lower classes. Drexler emphasised the need for a synthesis of nationalism with a form of economic socialism, in order to create a popular nationalist-oriented workers&#x27; movement that could challenge the rise of communism and internationalist politics. These were all well-known themes popular with various Weimar paramilitary groups such as the .

Drexler&#x27;s movement received attention and support from some influential figures. Supporter Dietrich Eckart, a well-to-do journalist, brought military figure Felix Graf von Bothmer, a prominent supporter of the concept of &quot;national socialism&quot;, to address the movement. Later in 1918, Karl Harrer (a journalist and member of the Thule Society) convinced Drexler and several others to form the (Political Workers&#x27; Circle). The members met periodically for discussions with themes of nationalism and racism directed against Jewish people. In December 1918, Drexler decided that a new political party should be formed, based on the political principles that he endorsed, by combining his branch of the Workers&#x27; Committee for a good Peace with the Political Workers&#x27; Circle.

On 5 January 1919, Drexler created a new political party and proposed it should be named the &quot;German Socialist Workers&#x27; Party&quot;, but Harrer objected to the term &quot;socialist&quot;; so the term was removed and the party was named the German Workers&#x27; Party (, DAP). To ease concerns among potential middle-class supporters, Drexler made clear that unlike Marxists the party supported the middle-class and that its socialist policy was meant to give social welfare to German citizens deemed part of the Aryan race. They became one of many &quot;völkisch&quot; movements that existed in Germany. Like other groups, the DAP advocated the belief that through profit-sharing instead of socialisation Germany should become a unified &quot;people&#x27;s community&quot; () rather than a society divided along class and party lines. This ideology was explicitly antisemitic. As early as 1920, the party was raising money by selling a tobacco called .

From the outset, the DAP was opposed to non-nationalist political movements, especially on the left, including the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). Members of the DAP saw themselves as fighting against &quot;Bolshevism&quot; and anyone considered a part of or aiding so-called &quot;international Jewry&quot;. The DAP was also deeply opposed to the Treaty of Versailles. The DAP did not attempt to make itself public and meetings were kept in relative secrecy, with public speakers discussing what they thought of Germany&#x27;s present state of affairs, or writing to like-minded societies in Northern Germany.

The DAP was a comparatively small group with fewer than 60 members. Nevertheless, it attracted the attention of the German authorities, who were suspicious of any organisation that appeared to have subversive tendencies. In July 1919, while stationed in Munich, army Adolf Hitler was appointed a (intelligence agent) of an (reconnaissance unit) of the (army) by Captain Mayr, the head of the &quot;Education and Propaganda Department&quot; (Dept Ib/P) in Bavaria. Hitler was assigned to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the DAP. While Hitler was initially unimpressed by the meetings and found them disorganised, he enjoyed the discussion that took place. While attending a party meeting on 12 September 1919 at Munich&#x27;s Sterneckerbräu, Hitler became involved in a heated argument with a visitor, Professor Baumann, who questioned the soundness of Gottfried Feder&#x27;s arguments against capitalism; Baumann proposed that Bavaria should break away from Prussia and found a new South German nation with Austria. In vehemently attacking the man&#x27;s arguments, Hitler made an impression on the other party members with his oratorical skills; according to Hitler, the &quot;professor&quot; left the hall acknowledging unequivocal defeat. Drexler encouraged him to join the DAP. On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party and within a week was accepted as party member 555 (the party began counting membership at 500 to give the impression they were a much larger party). Among the party&#x27;s earlier members were Ernst Röhm of the Army&#x27;s District Command VII; Dietrich Eckart, who has been called the spiritual father of National Socialism; then-University of Munich student Rudolf Hess; soldier Hans Frank; and Alfred Rosenberg, often credited as the philosopher of the movement. All were later prominent in the Nazi regime.

Hitler later claimed to be the seventh party member. He was, in fact, the seventh executive member of the party&#x27;s central committee and he would later wear the Golden Party Badge number one. Anton Drexler drafted a letter to Hitler in 1940—which was never sent—that contradicts Hitler&#x27;s later claim:
Although Hitler initially wanted to form his own party, he claimed to have been convinced to join the DAP because it was small and he could eventually become its leader. He consequently encouraged the organisation to become less of a debating society, which it had been previously, and more of an active political party. Normally, enlisted army personnel were not allowed to join political parties. In this case, Hitler had Captain Karl Mayr&#x27;s permission to join the DAP. Further, Hitler was allowed to stay in the army and receive his weekly pay of 20 gold marks a week. Unlike many other members of the organisation, this continued employment provided him with enough money to dedicate himself more fully to the DAP.

Hitler&#x27;s first DAP speech was held in the Hofbräukeller on 16 October 1919. He was the second speaker of the evening, and spoke to 111 people. Hitler later declared that this was when he realised he could really &quot;make a good speech&quot;. At first, Hitler spoke only to relatively small groups, but his considerable oratory and propaganda skills were appreciated by the party leadership. With the support of Anton Drexler, Hitler became chief of propaganda for the party in early 1920. Hitler began to make the party more public, and organised its biggest meeting yet of 2,000 people on 24 February 1920 in the . Such was the significance of this particular move in publicity that Karl Harrer resigned from the party in disagreement. It was in this speech that Hitler enunciated the twenty-five points of the German Workers&#x27; Party manifesto that had been drawn up by Drexler, Feder and himself. Through these points he gave the organisation a much bolder stratagem with a clear foreign policy (abrogation of the Treaty of Versailles, a Greater Germany, Eastern expansion and exclusion of Jews from citizenship) and among his specific points were: confiscation of war profits, abolition of unearned incomes, the State to share profits of land and land for national needs to be taken away without compensation. In general, the manifesto was antisemitic, anti-capitalist, anti-democratic, anti-Marxist and anti-liberal. To increase its appeal to larger segments of the population, on the same day as Hitler&#x27;s speech on 24 February 1920, the DAP changed its name to the (&quot;National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party&quot;, or Nazi Party). The name was intended to draw upon both left-wing and right-wing ideals, with &quot;Socialist&quot; and &quot;Workers&#x27;&quot; appealing to the left, and &quot;National&quot; and &quot;German&quot; appealing to the right. The word &quot;Socialist&quot; was added by the party&#x27;s executive committee (at the suggestion of Rudolf Jung), over Hitler&#x27;s initial objections, in order to help appeal to left-wing workers.

In 1920, the Nazi Party officially announced that only persons of &quot;pure Aryan descent []&quot; could become party members and if the person had a spouse, the spouse also had to be a &quot;racially pure&quot; Aryan. Party members could not be related either directly or indirectly to a so-called &quot;non-Aryan&quot;. Even before it had become legally forbidden by the Nuremberg Laws in 1935, the Nazis banned sexual relations and marriages between party members and Jews. Party members found guilty of (&quot;racial defilement&quot;) were persecuted heavily. Some members were even sentenced to death.

Hitler quickly became the party&#x27;s most active orator, appearing in public as a speaker 31 times within the first year after his self-discovery. Crowds began to flock to hear his speeches. Hitler always spoke about the same subjects: the Treaty of Versailles and the Jewish question. This deliberate technique and effective publicising of the party contributed significantly to his early success, about which a contemporary poster wrote: &quot;Since Herr Hitler is a brilliant speaker, we can hold out the prospect of an extremely exciting evening&quot;. Over the following months, the party continued to attract new members, while remaining too small to have any real significance in German politics. By the end of the year, party membership was recorded at 2,000, many of whom Hitler and Röhm had brought into the party personally, or for whom Hitler&#x27;s oratory had been their reason for joining.

Hitler&#x27;s talent as an orator and his ability to draw new members, combined with his characteristic ruthlessness, soon made him the dominant figure. However, while Hitler and Eckart were on a fundraising trip to Berlin in June 1921, a mutiny broke out within the party in Munich. Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival German Socialist Party (DSP). Upon returning to Munich on 11 July, Hitler angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that his resignation would mean the end of the party. Hitler announced he would rejoin on condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich. The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3,680. Hitler continued to face some opposition within the NSDAP, as his opponents had Hermann Esser expelled from the party and they printed 3,000 copies of a pamphlet attacking Hitler as a traitor to the party. In the following days, Hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself and Esser to thunderous applause.

Hitler&#x27;s strategy proved successful; at a special party congress on 29 July 1921, he replaced Drexler as party chairman by a vote of 533to1. The committee was dissolved, and Hitler was granted nearly absolute powers in the party as its sole leader. He would hold the post for the remainder of his life. Hitler soon acquired the title (&quot;leader&quot;) and after a series of sharp internal conflicts it was accepted that the party would be governed by the (&quot;leader principle&quot;). Under this principle, the party was a highly centralised entity that functioned strictly from the top down, with Hitler at the apex. Hitler saw the party as a revolutionary organisation, whose aim was the overthrow of the Weimar Republic, which he saw as controlled by the socialists, Jews and the &quot;November criminals&quot;, a term invented to describe alleged elements of society who had &#x27;betrayed the German soldiers&#x27; in 1918. The SA (&quot;storm troopers&quot;, also known as &quot;Brownshirts&quot;) were founded as a party militia in 1921 and began violent attacks on other parties.

For Hitler, the twin goals of the party were always German nationalist expansionism and antisemitism. These two goals were fused in his mind by his belief that Germany&#x27;s external enemies—Britain, France and the Soviet Union—were controlled by the Jews and that Germany&#x27;s future wars of national expansion would necessarily entail a war of annihilation against them. For Hitler and his principal lieutenants, national and racial issues were always dominant. This was symbolised by the adoption as the party emblem of the swastika. In German nationalist circles, the swastika was considered a symbol of an &quot;Aryan race&quot; and it symbolised the replacement of the Christian Cross with allegiance to a National Socialist State.

The Nazi Party grew significantly during 1921 and 1922, partly through Hitler&#x27;s oratorical skills, partly through the SA&#x27;s appeal to unemployed young men, and partly because there was a backlash against socialist and liberal politics in Bavaria as Germany&#x27;s economic problems deepened and the weakness of the Weimar regime became apparent. The party recruited former World War I soldiers, to whom Hitler as a decorated frontline veteran could particularly appeal, as well as small businessmen and disaffected former members of rival parties. Nazi rallies were often held in beer halls, where downtrodden men could get free beer. The Hitler Youth was formed for the children of party members. The party also formed groups in other parts of Germany. Julius Streicher in Nuremberg was an early recruit and became editor of the racist magazine . In December 1920, the Nazi Party had acquired a newspaper, the , of which its leading ideologist Alfred Rosenberg became editor. Others to join the party around this time were Heinrich Himmler and World War I flying ace Hermann Göring.

==== Adoption of Italian fascism: The Beer Hall Putsch ====
On 31 October 1922, a fascist party with similar policies and objectives came into power in Italy, the National Fascist Party, under the leadership of the charismatic Benito Mussolini. The Fascists, like the Nazis, promoted a national rebirth of their country, as they opposed communism and liberalism; appealed to the working-class; opposed the Treaty of Versailles; and advocated the territorial expansion of their country. Hitler was inspired by Mussolini and the Fascists, beginning to adopt elements of their program for the Nazi Party and himself. The Italian Fascists also used a straight-armed Roman salute and wore black-shirted uniforms; Hitler would later borrow their use of the straight-armed salute as a Nazi salute.

When the Fascists took control of Italy through their coup d&#x27;état called the &quot;March on Rome&quot;, Hitler began planning his own coup less than a month later. In January 1923, France occupied the Ruhr industrial region as a result of Germany&#x27;s failure to meet its reparations payments. This led to economic chaos, the resignation of Wilhelm Cuno&#x27;s government and an attempt by the German Communist Party (KPD) to stage a revolution. The reaction to these events was an upsurge of nationalist sentiment. Nazi Party membership grew sharply to about 20,000, compared to the approximate 6,000 at the beginning of 1923. By November 1923, Hitler had decided that the time was right for an attempt to seize power in Munich, in the hope that the (the post-war German military) would mutiny against the Berlin government and join his revolt. In this, he was influenced by former General Erich Ludendorff, who had become a supporter—though not a member—of the Nazis.

On the night of 8 November, the Nazis used a patriotic rally in a Munich beer hall to launch an attempted (&quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;). This so-called Beer Hall Putsch attempt failed almost at once when the local commanders refused to support it. On the morning of 9 November, the Nazis staged a march of about 2,000 supporters through Munich in an attempt to rally support. The two groups exchanged fire, after which 15 putschists, four police officers, and a bystander lay dead. Hitler, Ludendorff and a number of others were arrested and were tried for treason in March 1924. Hitler and his associates were given very lenient prison sentences. While Hitler was in prison, he wrote his semi-autobiographical political manifesto (&quot;My Struggle&quot;).

The Nazi Party was banned on 9 November 1923; however, with the support of the nationalist Völkisch-Social Bloc (), it continued to operate under the name &quot;German Party&quot; ( or DP) from 1924 to 1925. The Nazis failed to remain unified in the DP, as in the north, the right-wing Volkish nationalist supporters of the Nazis moved to the new German Völkisch Freedom Party, leaving the north&#x27;s left-wing Nazi members, such as Joseph Goebbels retaining support for the party.

=== Rise to power: 1925–1933 ===

Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, Hitler was released from prison on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor&#x27;s objections. On 16 February 1925, Hitler convinced the Bavarian authorities to lift the ban on the NSDAP and the party was formally refounded on 26 February 1925, with Hitler as its undisputed leader. It was at this time Hitler began referring to himself as &quot;der Führer&quot;. The new Nazi Party was no longer a paramilitary organisation and disavowed any intention of taking power by force. In any case, the economic and political situation had stabilised and the extremist upsurge of 1923 had faded, so there was no prospect of further revolutionary adventures. Instead, Hitler intended to alter the party&#x27;s strategy to achieving power through what he called the &quot;path of legality&quot;. The Nazi Party of 1925 was divided into the &quot;Leadership Corps&quot; () appointed by Hitler and the general membership (). The party and the SA were kept separate and the legal aspect of the party&#x27;s work was emphasised. In a sign of this, the party began to admit women. The SA and the SS members (the latter founded in 1925 as Hitler&#x27;s bodyguard, and known originally as the ) had to all be regular party members.

In the 1920s the Nazi Party expanded beyond its Bavarian base. At this time, it began surveying voters in order to determine what they were dissatisfied with in Germany, allowing Nazi propaganda to be altered accordingly. Catholic Bavaria maintained its right-wing nostalgia for a Catholic monarch; and Westphalia, along with working-class &quot;Red Berlin&quot;, were always the Nazis&#x27; weakest areas electorally, even during the Third Reich itself. The areas of strongest Nazi support were in rural Protestant areas such as Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg, Pomerania and East Prussia. Depressed working-class areas such as Thuringia also produced a strong Nazi vote, while the workers of the Ruhr and Hamburg largely remained loyal to the Social Democrats, the Communist Party of Germany or the Catholic Centre Party. Nuremberg remained a Nazi Party stronghold, and the first Nuremberg Rally was held there in 1927. These rallies soon became massive displays of Nazi paramilitary power and attracted many recruits. The Nazis&#x27; strongest appeal was to the lower middle-classes—farmers, public servants, teachers and small businessmen—who had suffered most from the inflation of the 1920s, so who feared Bolshevism more than anything else. The small business class was receptive to Hitler&#x27;s antisemitism, since it blamed Jewish big business for its economic problems. University students, disappointed at being too young to have served in the War of 1914–1918 and attracted by the Nazis&#x27; radical rhetoric, also became a strong Nazi constituency. By 1929, the party had 130,000 members.

The party&#x27;s nominal Deputy Leader was Rudolf Hess, but he had no real power in the party. By the early 1930s, the senior leaders of the party after Hitler were Heinrich Himmler, Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Göring. Beneath the Leadership Corps were the party&#x27;s regional leaders, the , each of whom commanded the party in his (&quot;region&quot;). Goebbels began his ascent through the party hierarchy as of Berlin-Brandenburg in 1926. Streicher was of Franconia, where he published his antisemitic newspaper . Beneath the were lower-level officials, the (&quot;county leaders&quot;), (&quot;cell leaders&quot;) and (&quot;block leaders&quot;). This was a strictly hierarchical structure in which orders flowed from the top and unquestioning loyalty was given to superiors. Only the SA retained some autonomy. Being composed largely of unemployed workers, many SA men took the Nazis&#x27; socialist rhetoric seriously. At this time, the Hitler salute (borrowed from the Italian fascists) and the greeting &quot;Heil Hitler!&quot; were adopted throughout the party.
The Nazis contested elections to the national parliament (the ) and to the state legislature (the ) from 1924, although at first with little success. The &quot;National Socialist Freedom Movement&quot; polled 3% of the vote in the December 1924 &quot;Reichstag&quot; elections and this fell to 2.6% in 1928. State elections produced similar results. Despite these poor results and despite Germany&#x27;s relative political stability and prosperity during the later 1920s, the Nazi Party continued to grow. This was partly because Hitler, who had no administrative ability, left the party organisation to the head of the secretariat, Philipp Bouhler, the party treasurer Franz Xaver Schwarz and business manager Max Amann. The party had a capable propaganda head in Gregor Strasser, who was promoted to national organizational leader in January 1928. These men gave the party efficient recruitment and organizational structures. The party also owed its growth to the gradual fading away of competitor nationalist groups, such as the German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP). As Hitler became the recognised head of the German nationalists, other groups declined or were absorbed. In the late 1920s, seeing the party&#x27;s lack of breakthrough into the mainstream, Goebbels proposed that instead of focusing all of their propaganda in major cities where there was competition from other political movements, they should instead begin holding rallies in rural areas where they would be more effective.

Despite these strengths, the Nazi Party might never have come to power had it not been for the Great Depression and its effects on Germany. By 1930, the German economy was beset with mass unemployment and widespread business failures. The Social Democrats and Communists were bitterly divided and unable to formulate an effective solution: this gave the Nazis their opportunity and Hitler&#x27;s message, blaming the crisis on the Jewish financiers and the Bolsheviks, resonated with wide sections of the electorate. At the September 1930 &quot;Reichstag&quot; elections, the Nazis won 18% of the votes and became the second-largest party in the after the Social Democrats. Hitler proved to be a highly effective campaigner, pioneering the use of radio and aircraft for this purpose. His dismissal of Strasser and his appointment of Goebbels as the party&#x27;s propaganda chief were major factors. While Strasser had used his position to promote his own leftish version of national socialism, Goebbels was completely loyal to Hitler, and worked only to improve Hitler&#x27;s image.

The 1930 elections changed the German political landscape by weakening the traditional nationalist parties, the DNVP and the DVP, leaving the Nazis as the chief alternative to the discredited Social Democrats and the Zentrum, whose leader, Heinrich Brüning, headed a weak minority government. The inability of the democratic parties to form a united front, the self-imposed isolation of the Communists and the continued decline of the economy, all played into Hitler&#x27;s hands. He now came to be seen as &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the opposition and donations poured into the Nazi Party&#x27;s coffers. Some major business figures, such as Fritz Thyssen, were Nazi supporters and gave generously and some Wall Street figures were allegedly involved, but many other businessmen were suspicious of the extreme nationalist tendencies of the Nazis and preferred to support the traditional conservative parties instead.

In 1930, as the price for joining a coalition government of the &quot;Land&quot; (state) of Thuringia, the Nazi Party received the state ministries of the Interior and Education. On 23 January 1930, Wilhelm Frick was appointed to these ministries, becoming the first Nazi to hold a ministerial-level post at any level in Germany.

In 1931 the Nazi Party altered its strategy to engage in perpetual campaigning across the country, even outside of election time. During 1931 and into 1932, Germany&#x27;s political crisis deepened. Hitler ran for president against the incumbent Paul von Hindenburg in March 1932, polling 30% in the first round and 37% in the second against Hindenburg&#x27;s 49% and 53%. By now the SA had 400,000 members and its running street battles with the SPD and Communist paramilitaries (who also fought each other) reduced some German cities to combat zones. Paradoxically, although the Nazis were among the main instigators of this disorder, part of Hitler&#x27;s appeal to a frightened and demoralised middle class was his promise to restore law and order. Overt antisemitism was played down in official Nazi rhetoric, but was never far from the surface. Germans voted for Hitler primarily because of his promises to revive the economy (by unspecified means), to restore German greatness and overturn the Treaty of Versailles and to save Germany from communism. On 24 April 1932, the Free State of Prussia elections to the Landtag resulted in 36% of the votes and 162 seats for the NSDAP.

On 20 July 1932, the Prussian government was ousted by a coup, the ; a few days later at the July 1932 &quot;Reichstag&quot; election the Nazis made another leap forward, polling 37% and becoming the largest party in parliament by a wide margin. Furthermore, the Nazis and the Communists between them won 52% of the vote and a majority of seats. Since both parties opposed the established political system and neither would join or support any ministry, this made the formation of a majority government impossible. The result was weak ministries governing by decree. Under Comintern directives, the Communists maintained their policy of treating the Social Democrats as the main enemy, calling them &quot;social fascists&quot;, thereby splintering opposition to the Nazis. Later, both the Social Democrats and the Communists accused each other of having facilitated Hitler&#x27;s rise to power by their unwillingness to compromise.

Chancellor Franz von Papen called another election in November, hoping to find a way out of this impasse. The electoral result was the same, with the Nazis and the Communists winning 50% of the vote between them and more than half the seats, rendering this no more workable than its predecessor. However, support for the Nazis had fallen to 33.1%, suggesting that the Nazi surge had passed its peak—possibly because the worst of the Depression had passed, possibly because some middle-class voters had supported Hitler in July as a protest, but had now drawn back from the prospect of actually putting him into power. The Nazis interpreted the result as a warning that they must seize power before their moment passed. Had the other parties united, this could have been prevented, but their shortsightedness made a united front impossible. Papen, his successor Kurt von Schleicher and the nationalist press magnate Alfred Hugenberg spent December and January in political intrigues that eventually persuaded President Hindenburg that it was safe to appoint Hitler as Reich Chancellor, at the head of a cabinet including only a minority of Nazi ministers—which he did on 30 January 1933.

==== Ascension and consolidation ====

In &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, Hitler directly attacked both left-wing and right-wing politics in Germany. However, a majority of scholars identify Nazism in practice as being a far-right form of politics. When asked in an interview in 1934 whether the Nazis were &quot;bourgeois right-wing&quot; as alleged by their opponents, Hitler responded that Nazism was not exclusively for any class and indicated that it favoured neither the left nor the right, but preserved &quot;pure&quot; elements from both &quot;camps&quot; by stating: &quot;From the camp of bourgeois tradition, it takes national resolve, and from the materialism of the Marxist dogma, living, creative Socialism&quot;.

The votes that the Nazis received in the 1932 elections established the Nazi Party as the largest parliamentary faction of the Weimar Republic government. Hitler was appointed as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933.

The &quot;Reichstag&quot; fire on 27 February 1933 gave Hitler a pretext for suppressing his political opponents. The following day he persuaded the Reich&#x27;s President Paul von Hindenburg to issue the &quot;Reichstag&quot; Fire Decree, which suspended most civil liberties. The NSDAP won the parliamentary election on 5 March 1933 with 44% of votes, but failed to win an absolute majority. After the election, hundreds of thousands of new members joined the party for opportunistic reasons, most of them civil servants and white-collar workers. They were nicknamed the &quot;casualties of March&quot; () or &quot;March violets&quot; (). To protect the party from too many non-ideological turncoats who were viewed by the so-called &quot;old fighters&quot; with some mistrust, the party issued a freeze on admissions that remained in force from May 1933 to 1937.

On 23 March, the parliament passed the Enabling Act of 1933, which gave the cabinet the right to enact laws without the consent of parliament. In effect, this gave Hitler dictatorial powers. Now possessing virtually absolute power, the Nazis established totalitarian control as they abolished labour unions and other political parties and imprisoned their political opponents, first at , improvised camps, then in concentration camps. Nazi Germany had been established, yet the remained impartial. Nazi power over Germany remained virtual, not absolute.

=== After taking power: intertwining of party and state ===
The Nazis embarked on a campaign of (coordination) to exert their control over all aspects of German government and society. During June and July 1933, all competing parties were either outlawed or dissolved themselves and subsequently the Law Against the Formation of Parties of 14 July 1933 legally established the Nazi Party&#x27;s monopoly. On 1 December 1933, the Law to Secure the Unity of Party and State entered into force, which was the base for a progressive intertwining of party structures and state apparatus. By this law, the SA—actually a party division—was given quasi-governmental authority and their &quot;Stabschef&quot; became a cabinet minister without portfolio. By virtue of the 30 January 1934 Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich, the (states) lost their sovereignty and were demoted to administrative divisions of the government. Effectively, they lost most of their power to the that were originally just regional divisions of the party, but took over most competencies of the state administration in their respective sectors.

During the Röhm Purge of 30 June to 2 July 1934 (also known as the &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot;), Hitler disempowered the SA&#x27;s leadership—most of whom belonged to the Strasserist (national revolutionary) faction within the NSDAP—and ordered them killed. He accused them of having conspired to stage a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, but it is believed that this was only a pretense to justify the suppression of any intraparty opposition. The purge was executed by the SS, assisted by the Gestapo and Reichswehr units. Aside from Strasserist Nazis, they also murdered anti-Nazi conservative figures like former chancellor von Schleicher. After this, the SA continued to exist but lost much of its importance, while the role of the SS grew significantly. Formerly only a sub-organisation of the SA, it was made into a separate organisation of the NSDAP in July 1934.

Upon the death of President Hindenburg on 2 August 1934, Hitler merged the offices of party leader, head of state and chief of government in one, taking the title of by passage of the Law Concerning the Head of State of the German Reich. The Chancellery of the Führer, officially an organisation of the Nazi Party, took over the functions of the Office of the President (a government agency), blurring the distinction between structures of party and state even further. The SS increasingly exerted police functions, a development which was formally documented by the merger of the offices of and Chief of the German Police on 17 June 1936, as the position was held by Heinrich Himmler who derived his authority directly from Hitler. The (SD, formally the &quot;Security Service of the Reichsführer-SS&quot;) that had been created in 1931 as an intraparty intelligence became the &quot;de facto&quot; intelligence agency of Nazi Germany. It was put under the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) in 1939, which then coordinated SD, Gestapo and criminal police, therefore functioning as a hybrid organisation of state and party structures.

=== Defeat and abolition ===
Officially, Nazi Germany lasted only 12 years. The Instrument of Surrender was signed by representatives of the German High Command at Berlin, on 8 May 1945, when the war ended in Europe. The party was formally abolished on 10 October 1945 by the Allied Control Council, followed by the process of denazification along with trials of major war criminals before the International Military Tribunal (IMT) in Nuremberg. Part of the Potsdam Agreement called for the destruction of the Nazi Party alongside the requirement for the reconstruction of the German political life. In addition, the Control Council Law no. 2 Providing for the Termination and Liquidation of the Nazi Organization specified the abolition of 52 other Nazi affiliated and supervised organisations and outlawed their activities. The denazification was carried out in Germany and continued until the onset of the Cold War.

Between 1939 and 1945, the Nazi Party led regime, assisted by collaborationist governments and recruits from occupied countries, was responsible for the deaths of at least eleven million people, including 5.5 to 6 million Jews (representing two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe), and between 200,000 and 1,500,000 Romani people. The estimated total number includes the killing of nearly two million non-Jewish Poles, over three million Soviet prisoners of war, communists, and other political opponents, homosexuals, the physically and mentally disabled.

== Political programme ==

The National Socialist Programme was a formulation of the policies of the party. It contained 25 points and is therefore also known as the &quot;25-point plan&quot; or &quot;25-point programme&quot;. It was the official party programme, with minor changes, from its proclamation as such by Hitler in 1920, when the party was still the German Workers&#x27; Party, until its dissolution.

== Party composition ==
=== Command structure ===
==== Top leadership ====
At the top of the Nazi Party was the party chairman (&quot;&quot;), who held absolute power and full command over the party. All other party offices were subordinate to his position and had to depend on his instructions. In 1934, Hitler founded a separate body for the chairman, Chancellery of the Führer, with its own sub-units.

Below the Führer&#x27;s chancellery was first the &quot;Staff of the Deputy Führer&quot;, headed by Rudolf Hess from 21 April 1933 to 10 May 1941; and then the &quot;Party Chancellery&quot; (), headed by Martin Bormann.

Following Hitler&#x27;s suicide on 30 April 1945, Bormann would be named as Party Minister, which gave him the top position in the Nazi Party itself; unlike Hitler, however, Bormann would not have a leadership role over the government of Nazi Germany. Bormann, whose fate would remain unknown for several decades, would soon afterwards commit suicide as well on 2 May 1945 while trying to flee Berlin around the time Soviet Union forces captured the city. His remains were first identified in 1972, then again in 1998 through DNA testing.

==== &quot;Reichsleiter&quot; ====
Directly subjected to the Führer were the (&quot;Reich Leader(s)&quot;—the singular and plural forms are identical in German), whose number was gradually increased to eighteen. They held power and influence comparable to the Reich Ministers&#x27; in Hitler&#x27;s Cabinet. The eighteen formed the &quot;Reich Leadership of the Nazi Party&quot; (), which was established at the so-called Brown House in Munich. Unlike a , a did not have individual geographic areas under their command, but were responsible for specific spheres of interest.

=== Nazi Party offices ===
The Nazi Party had a number of party offices dealing with various political and other matters. These included:
* (RPA): &quot;NSDAP Office of Racial Policy&quot;
* (APA): &quot;NSDAP Office of Foreign Affairs&quot;
* (KPA): &quot;NSDAP Office of Colonial Policy&quot;
* (WPA): &quot;NSDAP Office of Military Policy&quot;
* (ARo): &quot;Rosenberg Office&quot;

=== Paramilitary groups ===
In addition to the Nazi Party proper, several paramilitary groups existed which &quot;supported&quot; Nazi aims. All members of these paramilitary organisations were required to become regular Nazi Party members first and could then enlist in the group of their choice. An exception was the Waffen-SS, considered the military arm of the SS and Nazi Party, which during the Second World War allowed members to enlist without joining the Nazi Party. Foreign volunteers of the Waffen-SS were also not required to be members of the Nazi Party, although many joined local nationalist groups from their own countries with the same aims. Police officers, including members of the Gestapo, frequently held SS rank for administrative reasons (known as &quot;rank parity&quot;) and were likewise not required to be members of the Nazi Party.

A vast system of Nazi Party paramilitary ranks developed for each of the various paramilitary groups. This was part of the process of with the paramilitary and auxiliary groups swallowing existing associations and federations after the Party was flooded by millions of membership applications.

The major Nazi Party paramilitary groups were as follows:
* (SS): &quot;Protection Squadron&quot; (both and Waffen-SS)
* (SA): &quot;Storm Division&quot;
* (NSFK): &quot;National Socialist Flyers Corps&quot;
* (NSKK): &quot;National Socialist Motor Corps&quot;

The Hitler Youth was a paramilitary group divided into an adult leadership corps and a general membership open to boys aged fourteen to eighteen. The League of German Girls was the equivalent group for girls.

=== Affiliated organisations ===
Certain nominally independent organisations had their own legal representation and own property, but were supported by the Nazi Party. Many of these associated organisations were labour unions of various professions. Some were older organisations that were nazified according to the policy after the 1933 takeover.
* Reich League of German Officials (union of civil servants, predecessor to German Civil Service Federation)
* German Labour Front (DAF)
* National Socialist German Doctors&#x27; League
* National Socialist League for the Maintenance of the Law (NSRB, 1936–1945, earlier National Socialist German Lawyers&#x27; League)
* National Socialist War Victim&#x27;s Care (NSKOV)
* National Socialist Teachers League (NSLB)
* National Socialist People&#x27;s Welfare (NSV)
* Reich Labour Service (RAD)
* German Faith Movement
* German Colonial League (RKB)
* German Red Cross
* Kyffhäuser League
* Technical Emergency Relief (TENO)
* Reich&#x27;s Union of Large Families
* Reichsluftschutzbund (RLB)
* Reichskolonialbund (RKB)
* Bund Deutscher Osten (BDO)
* German American Bund

The employees of large businesses with international operations such as Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, and Commerzbank were mostly party members. All German businesses abroad were also required to have their own Nazi Party liaison men, which enabled the party leadership to obtain updated and excellent intelligence on the actions of the global corporate elites.

== Regional administration ==

For the purpose of centralisation in the process, a rigidly hierarchal structure was established in the Nazi Party, which it later carried through in the whole of Germany in order to consolidate total power under the person of Hitler (). It was regionally sub-divided into a number of (singular: ) headed by a , who received their orders directly from Hitler. The name (originally a term for sub-regions of the Holy Roman Empire headed by a ) for these new provincial structures was deliberately chosen because of its mediaeval connotations. The term is approximately equivalent to the English .

While the Nazis maintained the nominal existence of state and regional governments in Germany itself, this policy was not extended to territories acquired after 1937. Even in German-speaking areas such as Austria, state and regional governments were formally disbanded as opposed to just being dis-empowered.

After the a new type of administrative unit was introduced called a . In these territories the also held the position of (Reich Governor) thereby formally combining the spheres of both party and state offices. The establishment of this type of district was subsequently carried out for any further territorial annexations of Germany both before and during World War II. Even the former territories of Prussia were never formally re-integrated into what was then Germany&#x27;s largest state after being re-taken in the 1939 Polish campaign.

The and (state or province) were further sub-divided into (counties) headed by a , which were in turn sub-divided into (cells) and (blocks), headed by a and respectively.

A reorganisation of the &quot;Gaue&quot; was enacted on 1 October 1928. The given numbers were the official ordering numbers. The statistics are from 1941, for which the &quot;Gau&quot; organisation of that moment in time forms the basis. Their size and populations are not exact; for instance, according to the official party statistics the &quot;Gau&quot; Kurmark/Mark Brandenburg was the largest in the German Reich. By 1941, there were 42 territorial &quot;Gaue&quot; for Greater Germany. Of these, 10 were designated as Reichsgaue: 7 of them for Austria, one for the Sudetenland (annexed from Czechoslovakia) and two for the areas annexed from Poland and the Free City of Danzig after the joint invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939 at the onset of World War II. Getting the leadership of the individual &quot;Gaue&quot; to co-operate with one another proved difficult at times since there was constant administrative and financial jockeying for control going on between them.

The first table below describes the organizational structure for the &quot;Gaue&quot; that existed before their dissolution in 1945. Information on former &quot;Gaue&quot; (that were either renamed, or dissolved by being divided or merged with other &quot;Gaue&quot;) is provided in the second table.

=== Nazi Party &quot;Gaue&quot; ===
Later Gaue:
:* Flanders, existed from 15 December 1944 (&quot;Gauleiter&quot; in German exile: Jef van de Wiele)
:* Wallonia, existed from 8 December 1944 (&quot;Gauleiter&quot; in German exile: Léon Degrelle)

=== &quot;Gaue&quot; dissolved before 1945 ===
The numbering is not based on any official former ranking, but merely listed alphabetically. that were simply renamed without territorial changes bear the designation RN in the column &quot;later became.&quot; that were divided into more than one bear the designation D in the column &quot;later became.&quot; that were merged with other (or occupied territory) bear the designation M in the column &quot;together with.&quot;

=== Associated organisations abroad ===
==== &quot;Gaue&quot; in Switzerland ====
The irregular Swiss branch of the Nazi Party also established a number of Party in that country, most of them named after their regional capitals. These included , , , and . The (East Switzerland) combined the territories of three cantons: St. Gallen, Thurgau and Appenzell.

== Membership ==
=== General membership ===

The general membership of the Nazi Party mainly consisted of the urban and rural lower middle classes. 7% belonged to the upper class, another 7% were peasants, 35% were industrial workers and 51% were what can be described as middle class. In early 1933, just before Hitler&#x27;s appointment to the chancellorship, the party showed an under-representation of &quot;workers&quot;, who made up 30% of the membership but 46% of German society. Conversely, white-collar employees (19% of members and 12% of Germans), the self-employed (20% of members and 10% of Germans) and civil servants (15% of members and 5% of the German population) had joined in proportions greater than their share of the general population. These members were affiliated with local branches of the party, of which there were 1,378 throughout the country in 1928. In 1932, the number had risen to 11,845, reflecting the party&#x27;s growth in this period.

When it came to power in 1933, the Nazi Party had over members. In 1939, the membership total rose to 5.3 million with 81% being male and 19% being female. It continued to attract many more and by 1945 the party reached its peak of 8 million with 63% being male and 37% being female (about 10% of the German population of 80 million).

=== Military membership ===

Nazi members with military ambitions were encouraged to join the Waffen-SS, but a great number enlisted in the and even more were drafted for service after World War II began. Early regulations required that all members be non-political and any Nazi member joining in the 1930s was required to resign from the Nazi Party.

However, this regulation was soon waived and full Nazi Party members served in the in particular after the outbreak of World War II. The Reserves also saw a high number of senior Nazis enlisting, with Reinhard Heydrich and Fritz Todt joining the , as well as Karl Hanke who served in the army.

The British historian Richard J. Evans wrote that junior officers in the army were inclined to be especially zealous National Socialists with a third of them having joined the Nazi Party by 1941. Reinforcing the work of the junior leaders were the National Socialist Leadership Guidance Officers, which were created with the purpose of indoctrinating the troops for the &quot;war of extermination&quot; against Soviet Russia. Among higher-ranking officers, 29% were NSDAP members by 1941.

=== Student membership ===
In 1926, the party formed a special division to engage the student population, known as the National Socialist German Students&#x27; League (NSDStB). A group for university lecturers, the National Socialist German University Lecturers&#x27; League (NSDDB), also existed until July 1944.

=== Women membership ===
The National Socialist Women&#x27;s League was the women&#x27;s organization of the party and by 1938 it had approximately 2 million members.

=== Membership outside Germany ===
Party members who lived outside Germany were pooled into the (NSDAP/AO, &quot;Foreign Organization&quot;). The organisation was limited only to so-called &quot;Imperial Germans&quot; (citizens of the German Empire); and &quot;Ethnic Germans&quot; (), who did not hold German citizenship were not permitted to join.

Under Beneš decree No. 16/1945 Coll., in case of citizens of Czechoslovakia membership of the Nazi Party was punishable by between five and twenty years of imprisonment.

==== &quot;Deutsche Gemeinschaft&quot; ====
 was a branch of the Nazi Party founded in 1919, created for Germans with status. It is not to be confused with the post-war right-wing , which was founded in 1949.

Notable members included:
* Oswald Menghin (Vienna)
* Hermann Neubacher who was responsible for invading Yugoslavia.
* Rudolf Much (Vienna)
* Arthur Seyß-Inquart (Vienna)

== Party symbols ==
* Nazi flags: The Nazi Party used a right-facing swastika as their symbol and the red and black colours were said to represent (&quot;blood and soil&quot;). Another definition of the flag describes the colours as representing the ideology of National Socialism, the swastika representing the Aryan race and the Aryan nationalist agenda of the movement; white representing Aryan racial purity; and red representing the socialist agenda of the movement. Black, white and red were in fact the colours of the old North German Confederation flag (invented by Otto von Bismarck, based on the Prussian colours black and white and the red used by northern German states). In 1871, with the foundation of the German Reich the flag of the North German Confederation became the German (&quot;Reich flag&quot;). Black, white and red became the colours of the nationalists through the following history (for example World War I and the Weimar Republic).
:The design, with the centred swastika disc, served as the party flag from 1920. Between 1933 (when the Nazi Party came to power) and 1935, it was used as the National flag () and Merchant flag (), but interchangeably with the black-white-red horizontal tricolour. In 1935, the black-white-red horizontal tricolour was scrapped (again) and the flag with the off-centre swastika and disc was instituted as the national flag, and remained as such until 1945. The flag with the centred disk continued to be used after 1935, but exclusively as the , the flag of the party.
* German eagle: The Nazi Party used the traditional German eagle, standing atop of a swastika inside a wreath of oak leaves. It is also known as the &quot;Iron Eagle&quot;. When the eagle is looking to its left shoulder, it symbolises the Nazi Party and was called the . In contrast, when the eagle is looking to its right shoulder, it symbolises the country () and was therefore called the . After the Nazi Party came to national power in Germany, they replaced the traditional version of the German eagle with the modified party symbol throughout the country and all its institutions.

<text>New Age is a range of spiritual or religious practices and beliefs which rapidly grew in Western society during the early 1970s. Its highly eclectic and unsystematic structure makes a precise definition difficult. Although many scholars consider it a religious movement, its adherents typically see it as spiritual or as unifying Mind-Body-Spirit, and rarely use the term &quot;New Age&quot; themselves. Scholars often call it the New Age movement, although others contest this term and suggest it is better seen as a &quot;milieu&quot; or &quot;zeitgeist&quot;.
As a form of Western esotericism, the New Age drew heavily upon esoteric traditions such as the occultism of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, including the work of Emanuel Swedenborg and Franz Mesmer, as well as Spiritualism, New Thought, and Theosophy. More immediately, it arose from mid-twentieth century influences such as the UFO religions of the 1950s, the counterculture of the 1960s, and the Human Potential Movement. Its exact origins remain contested, but it became a major movement in the 1970s, at which time it was centered largely in the United Kingdom. It expanded widely in the 1980s and 1990s, in particular in the United States. By the start of the 21st century, the term &quot;New Age&quot; was increasingly rejected within this milieu, with some scholars arguing that the New Age phenomenon had ended.

Despite its eclectic nature, the New Age has several main currents. Theologically, the New Age typically accepts a holistic form of divinity that pervades the universe, including human beings themselves, leading to a strong emphasis on the spiritual authority of the self. This is accompanied by a common belief in a variety of semi-divine non-human entities such as angels, with whom humans can communicate, particularly by channeling through a human intermediary. Typically viewing history as divided into spiritual ages, a common New Age belief is in a forgotten age of great technological advancement and spiritual wisdom, declining into periods of increasing violence and spiritual degeneracy, which will now be remedied by the emergence of an Age of Aquarius, from which the milieu gets its name. There is also a strong focus on healing, particularly using forms of alternative medicine, and an emphasis on unifying science with spirituality.

The dedication of New Agers varied considerably, from those who adopted a number of New Age ideas and practices to those who fully embraced and dedicated their lives to it. The New Age has generated criticism from Christians as well as modern Pagan and Indigenous communities. From the 1990s onward, the New Age became the subject of research by academic scholars of religious studies.

==Definitions==
The New Age phenomenon has proved difficult to define, with much scholarly disagreement as to its scope. The scholars Steven J. Sutcliffe and Ingvild Sælid Gilhus have even suggested that it remains &quot;among the most disputed of categories in the study of religion&quot;.

The scholar of religion Paul Heelas characterised the New Age as &quot;an eclectic hotch-potch of beliefs, practices, and ways of life&quot; that can be identified as a singular phenomenon through their use of &quot;the same (or very similar) &quot;lingua franca&quot; to do with the human (and planetary) condition and how it can be transformed.&quot; Similarly, the historian of religion Olav Hammer termed it &quot;a common denominator for a variety of quite divergent contemporary popular practices and beliefs&quot; that have emerged since the late 1970s and are &quot;largely united by historical links, a shared discourse and an &quot;air de famille&quot;&quot;. According to Hammer, this New Age was a &quot;fluid and fuzzy cultic milieu&quot;. The sociologist of religion Michael York described the New Age as &quot;an umbrella term that includes a great variety of groups and identities&quot; that are united by their &quot;expectation of a major and universal change being primarily founded on the individual and collective development of human potential.&quot;

The scholar of religion Wouter Hanegraaff adopted a different approach by asserting that &quot;New Age&quot; was &quot;a &quot;label&quot; attached indiscriminately to whatever seems to fit it&quot; and that as a result it &quot;means very different things to different people&quot;. He thus argued against the idea that the New Age could be considered &quot;a unified ideology or &quot;Weltanschauung&quot;&quot;, although he believed that it could be considered a &quot;more or less unified &#x27;movement&#x27;.&quot; Other scholars have suggested that the New Age is too diverse to be a singular &quot;movement&quot;. The scholar of religion George D. Chryssides called it &quot;a counter-cultural &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;&quot;, while the sociologist of religion Steven Bruce suggested that New Age was a milieu; Heelas and scholar of religion Linda Woodhead called it the &quot;holistic milieu&quot;.

There is no central authority within the New Age phenomenon that can determine what counts as New Age and what does not. Many of those groups and individuals who could analytically be categorised as part of the New Age reject the term &quot;New Age&quot; in reference to themselves. Some even express active hostility to the term. Rather than terming themselves &quot;New Agers&quot;, those involved in this milieu commonly describe themselves as spiritual &quot;seekers&quot;, and some self-identify as a member of a different religious group, such as Christianity, Judaism, or Buddhism. In 2003 Sutcliffe observed that the use of the term &quot;New Age&quot; was &quot;optional, episodic and declining overall&quot;, adding that among the very few individuals who did use it, they usually did so with qualification, for instance by placing it in quotation marks. Other academics, such as Sara MacKian, have argued that the sheer diversity of the New Age renders the term too problematic for scholars to use. MacKian proposed &quot;everyday spirituality&quot; as an alternate term.

While acknowledging that &quot;New Age&quot; was a problematic term, the scholar of religion James R. Lewis stated that it remained a useful etic category for scholars to use because &quot;There exists no comparable term which covers all aspects of the movement.&quot; Similarly, Chryssides argued that the fact that &quot;New Age&quot; is a &quot;theoretical concept&quot; does not &quot;undermine its usefulness or employability&quot;; he drew comparisons with &quot;Hinduism&quot;, a similar &quot;Western etic piece of vocabulary&quot; that scholars of religion used despite its problems.

===Religion, spirituality, and esotericism===

In discussing the New Age, academics have varyingly referred to &quot;New Age spirituality&quot; and &quot;New Age religion&quot;. Those involved in the New Age rarely consider it to be &quot;religion&quot;—negatively associating that term solely with organized religion—and instead describe their practices as &quot;spirituality&quot;. Religious studies scholars, however, have repeatedly referred to the New Age milieu as a &quot;religion&quot;. York described the New Age as a new religious movement (NRM). Conversely, both Heelas and Sutcliffe rejected this categorisation; Heelas believed that while elements of the New Age represented NRMs, this did not apply to every New Age group. Similarly, Chryssides stated that the New Age could not be seen as &quot;a religion&quot; in itself.

The New Age is also a form of Western esotericism. Hanegraaff regarded the New Age as a form of &quot;popular culture criticism&quot;, in that it represented a reaction against the dominant Western values of Judeo-Christian religion and rationalism, adding that &quot;New Age religion formulates such criticism not at random, but falls back on&quot; the ideas of earlier Western esoteric groups.

The New Age has also been identified by various scholars of religion as part of the cultic milieu. This concept, developed by the sociologist Colin Campbell, refers to a social network of marginalized ideas. Through their shared marginalization within a given society, these disparate ideas interact and create new syntheses.

Hammer identified much of the New Age as corresponding to the concept of &quot;folk religions&quot; in that it seeks to deal with existential questions regarding subjects like death and disease in &quot;an unsystematic fashion, often through a process of bricolage from already available narratives and rituals&quot;. York also heuristically divides the New Age into three broad trends. The first, the &quot;social camp&quot;, represents groups that primarily seek to bring about social change, while the second, the &quot;occult camp&quot;, instead focus on contact with spirit entities and channeling. York&#x27;s third group, the &quot;spiritual camp&quot;, represents a middle ground between these two camps that focuses largely on individual development.

===Terminology===
The term &quot;new age&quot;, along with related terms like &quot;new era&quot; and &quot;new world&quot;, long predate the emergence of the New Age movement, and have widely been used to assert that a better way of life for humanity is dawning. It occurs commonly, for instance, in political contexts; the Great Seal of the United States, designed in 1782, proclaims a &quot;new order of ages&quot;, while in the 1980s the Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev proclaimed that &quot;all mankind is entering a new age&quot;. The term has also appeared within Western esoteric schools of thought, having a scattered use from the mid-nineteenth century onward. In 1864 the American Swedenborgian Warren Felt Evans published &quot;The New Age and its Message&quot;, while in 1907 Alfred Orage and Holbrook Jackson began editing a weekly journal of Christian liberalism and socialism titled &quot;The New Age&quot;. The concept of a coming &quot;new age&quot; that would be inaugurated by the return to Earth of Jesus Christ was a theme in the poetry of Wellesley Tudor Pole (1884–1968) and of Johanna Brandt (1876–1964), and then also appeared in the work of the British-born American Theosophist Alice Bailey (1880–1949), featuring in titles such as &quot;Discipleship in the New Age&quot; (1944) and &quot;Education in the New Age&quot; (1954).

Between the 1930s and 1960s a small number of groups and individuals became preoccupied with the concept of a coming &quot;New Age&quot; and used the term accordingly. The term had thus become a recurring motif in the esoteric spirituality milieu. Sutcliffe, therefore, expressed the view that while the term &quot;New Age&quot; had originally been an &quot;apocalyptic emblem&quot;, it would only be later that it became &quot;a tag or codeword for a &#x27;spiritual&#x27; idiom&quot;.

==History==

===Antecedents in occult and theosophy===
According to scholar Nevill Drury, the New Age has a &quot;tangible history&quot;, although Hanegraaff expressed the view that most New Agers were &quot;surprisingly ignorant about the actual historical roots of their beliefs&quot;. Similarly, Hammer thought that &quot;source amnesia&quot; was a &quot;building block of a New Age worldview&quot;, with New Agers typically adopting ideas with no awareness of where those ideas originated.

As a form of Western esotericism, the New Age has antecedents that stretch back to southern Europe in Late Antiquity. Following the Age of Enlightenment in 18th-century Europe, new esoteric ideas developed in response to the development of scientific rationality. Scholars call this new esoteric trend &quot;occultism&quot;, and this occultism was a key factor in the development of the worldview from which the New Age emerged.

One of the earliest influences on the New Age was the Swedish 18th-century Christian mystic Emanuel Swedenborg, who professed the ability to communicate with angels, demons, and spirits. Swedenborg&#x27;s attempt to unite science and religion and his prediction of a coming era in particular have been cited as ways that he prefigured the New Age. Another early influence was the late 18th and early 19th century German physician and hypnotist Franz Mesmer, who wrote about the existence of a force known as &quot;animal magnetism&quot; running through the human body. The establishment of Spiritualism, an occult religion influenced by both Swedenborgianism and Mesmerism, in the U.S. during the 1840s has also been identified as a precursor to the New Age, in particular through its rejection of established Christianity, representing itself as a scientific approach to religion, and its emphasis on channeling spirit entities.

A further major influence on the New Age was the Theosophical Society, an occult group co-founded by the Russian Helena Blavatsky in the late 19th century. In her books &quot;Isis Unveiled&quot; (1877) and &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot; (1888), Blavatsky wrote that her Society was conveying the essence of all world religions, and it thus emphasized a focus on comparative religion. Serving as a partial bridge between Theosophical ideas and those of the New Age was the American esotericist Edgar Cayce, who founded the Association for Research and Enlightenment. Another partial bridge was the Danish mystic Martinus who is popular in Scandinavia.

Another influence was New Thought, which developed in late nineteenth-century New England as a Christian-oriented healing movement before spreading throughout the United States. Another influence was the psychologist Carl Jung.
Drury also identified as an important influence upon the New Age the Indian Swami Vivekananda, an adherent of the philosophy of Vedanta who first brought Hinduism to the West in the late 19th century.

Hanegraaff believed that the New Age&#x27;s direct antecedents could be found in the UFO religions of the 1950s, which he termed a &quot;proto-New Age movement&quot;. Many of these new religious movements had strong apocalyptic beliefs regarding a coming new age, which they typically asserted would be brought about by contact with extraterrestrials. Examples of such groups included the Aetherius Society, founded in the UK in 1955, and the Heralds of the New Age, established in New Zealand in 1956.

=== 1960s ===
From a historical perspective, the New Age phenomenon is most associated with the counterculture of the 1960s. According to author Andrew Grant Jackson, George Harrison&#x27;s adoption of Hindu philosophy and Indian instrumentation in his songs with the Beatles in the mid-1960s, together with the band&#x27;s highly publicised study of Transcendental Meditation, &quot;truly kick-started&quot; the Human Potential Movement that subsequently became New Age. Although not common throughout the counterculture, usage of the terms &quot;New Age&quot; and &quot;Age of Aquarius&quot;—used in reference to a coming era—were found within it, for instance appearing on adverts for the Woodstock festival of 1969, and in the lyrics of &quot;Aquarius&quot;, the opening song of the 1967 musical &quot;Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical&quot;.
This decade also witnessed the emergence of a variety of new religious movements and newly established religions in the United States, creating a spiritual milieu from which the New Age drew upon; these included the San Francisco Zen Center, Transcendental Meditation, Soka Gakkai, the Inner Peace Movement, the Church of All Worlds, and the Church of Satan. Although there had been an established interest in Asian religious ideas in the U.S. from at least the eighteenth-century, many of these new developments were variants of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sufism, which had been imported to the West from Asia following the U.S. government&#x27;s decision to rescind the Asian Exclusion Act in 1965. In 1962 the Esalen Institute was established in Big Sur, California. Esalen and similar personal growth centers had developed links to humanistic psychology, and from this, the human potential movement emerged and strongly influenced the New Age.

In Britain, a number of small religious groups that came to be identified as the &quot;light&quot; movement had begun declaring the existence of a coming new age, influenced strongly by the Theosophical ideas of Blavatsky and Bailey. The most prominent of these groups was the Findhorn Foundation, which founded the Findhorn Ecovillage in the Scottish area of Findhorn, Moray in 1962. Although its founders were from an older generation, Findhorn attracted increasing numbers of countercultural baby boomers during the 1960s, to the extent that its population had grown sixfold to c. 120 residents by 1972. In October 1965, the co-founder of Findhorn Foundation, Peter Caddy, a former member of the occult Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship, attended a meeting of various figures within Britain&#x27;s esoteric milieu; advertised as &quot;The Significance of the Group in the New Age&quot;, it was held at Attingham Park over the course of a weekend.

All of these groups created the backdrop from which the New Age movement emerged. As James R. Lewis and J. Gordon Melton point out, the New Age phenomenon represents &quot;a synthesis of many different preexisting movements and strands of thought&quot;. Nevertheless, York asserted that while the New Age bore many similarities with both earlier forms of Western esotericism and Asian religion, it remained &quot;distinct from its predecessors in its own self-consciousness as a new way of thinking&quot;.

===Emergence and development: c. 1970–2000===


By the early 1970s, use of the term &quot;New Age&quot; was increasingly common within the cultic milieu. This was because—according to Sutcliffe—the &quot;emblem&quot; of the &quot;New Age&quot; had been passed from the &quot;subcultural pioneers&quot; in groups like Findhorn to the wider array of &quot;countercultural baby boomers&quot; between and 1974. He noted that as this happened, the meaning of the term &quot;New Age&quot; changed; whereas it had once referred specifically to a coming era, at this point it came to be used in a wider sense to refer to a variety of spiritual activities and practices. In the latter part of the 1970s, the New Age expanded to cover a wide variety of alternative spiritual and religious beliefs and practices, not all of which explicitly held to the belief in the Age of Aquarius, but were nevertheless widely recognized as broadly similar in their search for &quot;alternatives&quot; to mainstream society. In doing so, the &quot;New Age&quot; became a banner under which to bring together the wider &quot;cultic milieu&quot; of American society.

The counterculture of the 1960s had rapidly declined by the start of the 1970s, in large part due to the collapse of the commune movement, but it would be many former members of the counter-culture and hippie subculture who subsequently became early adherents of the New Age movement.
The exact origins of the New Age movement remain an issue of debate; Melton asserted that it emerged in the early 1970s, whereas Hanegraaff instead traced its emergence to the latter 1970s, adding that it then entered its full development in the 1980s. This early form of the movement was based largely in Britain and exhibited a strong influence from theosophy and Anthroposophy. Hanegraaff termed this early core of the movement the &quot;New Age sensu stricto&quot;, or &quot;New Age in the strict sense&quot;.

Hanegraaff terms the broader development the &quot;New Age sensu lato&quot;, or &quot;New Age in the wider sense&quot;. Stores that came to be known as &quot;New Age shops&quot; opened up, selling related books, magazines, jewelry, and crystals, and they were typified by the playing of New Age music and the smell of incense.This probably influenced several thousand small metaphysical book- and gift-stores that increasingly defined themselves as &quot;New Age bookstores&quot;, while New Age titles came to be increasingly available from mainstream bookstores and then websites like Amazon.com.

Not everyone who came to be associated with the New Age phenomenon openly embraced the term &quot;New Age&quot;, although it was popularised in books like David Spangler&#x27;s 1977 work &quot;Revelation: The Birth of a New Age&quot; and Mark Satin&#x27;s 1979 book &quot;New Age Politics: Healing Self and Society&quot;. Marilyn Ferguson&#x27;s 1982 book &quot;The Aquarian Conspiracy&quot; has also been regarded as a landmark work in the development of the New Age, promoting the idea that a new era was emerging. Other terms that were employed synonymously with &quot;New Age&quot; in this milieu included &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;Holistic&quot;, &quot;Alternative&quot;, and &quot;Spiritual&quot;.

1971 witnessed the foundation of est by Werner H. Erhard, a transformational training course that became a part of the early movement. Melton suggested that the 1970s witnessed the growth of a relationship between the New Age movement and the older New Thought movement, as evidenced by the widespread use of Helen Schucman&#x27;s &quot;A Course in Miracles&quot; (1975), New Age music, and crystal healing in New Thought churches. Some figures in the New Thought movement were skeptical, challenging the compatibility of New Age and New Thought perspectives. During these decades, Findhorn had become a site of pilgrimage for many New Agers, and greatly expanded in size as people joined the community, with workshops and conferences being held there that brought together New Age thinkers from across the world.

Several key events occurred, which raised public awareness of the New Age subculture: publication of Linda Goodman&#x27;s best-selling astrology books &quot;Sun Signs&quot; (1968) and &quot;Love Signs&quot; (1978); the release of Shirley MacLaine&#x27;s book &quot;Out on a Limb&quot; (1983), later adapted into a television mini-series with the same name (1987); and the &quot;Harmonic Convergence&quot; planetary alignment on August 16 and 17, 1987, organized by José Argüelles in Sedona, Arizona. The Convergence attracted more people to the movement than any other single event. Heelas suggested that the movement was influenced by the &quot;enterprise culture&quot; encouraged by the U.S. and U.K. governments during the 1980s onward, with its emphasis on initiative and self-reliance resonating with any New Age ideas.

Channelers Jane Roberts (Seth Material), Helen Schucman (&quot;A Course in Miracles&quot;), J. Z. Knight (Ramtha), Neale Donald Walsch (&quot;Conversations with God&quot;) contributed to the movement&#x27;s growth. The first significant exponent of the New Age movement in the U.S. has been cited as Ram Dass. Core works in the propagating of New Age ideas included Jane Roberts&#x27;s Seth series, published from 1972 onward, Helen Schucman&#x27;s 1975 publication &quot;A Course in Miracles&quot;, and James Redfield&#x27;s 1993 work &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot;. A number of these books became best sellers, such as the Seth book series which quickly sold over a million copies. Supplementing these books were videos, audiotapes, compact discs and websites. The development of the internet in particular further popularized New Age ideas and made them more widely accessible.

New Age ideas influenced the development of rave culture in the late 1980s and 1990s. In Britain during the 1980s, the term &quot;New Age Travellers&quot; came into use, although York characterised this term as &quot;a misnomer created by the media&quot;. These New Age Travellers had little to do with the New Age as the term was used more widely, with scholar of religion Daren Kemp observing that &quot;New Age spirituality is not an essential part of New Age Traveller culture, although there are similarities between the two worldviews&quot;. The term &quot;New Age&quot; came to be used increasingly widely by the popular media in the 1990s.

===Decline or transformation: 1990–present===
By the late 1980s, some publishers dropped the term &quot;New Age&quot; as a marketing device. In 1994, the scholar of religion Gordon J. Melton presented a conference paper in which he argued that, given that he knew of nobody describing their practices as &quot;New Age&quot; anymore, the New Age had died. In 2001, Hammer observed that the term &quot;New Age&quot; had increasingly been rejected as either pejorative or meaningless by individuals within the Western cultic milieu. He also noted that within this milieu it was not being replaced by any alternative and that as such a sense of collective identity was being lost.

Other scholars disagreed with Melton&#x27;s idea; in 2004 Daren Kemp stated that &quot;New Age is still very much alive&quot;. Hammer himself stated that &quot;the New Age &quot;movement&quot; may be on the wane, but the wider New Age &quot;religiosity&quot;... shows no sign of disappearing&quot;. MacKian suggested that the New Age &quot;movement&quot; had been replaced by a wider &quot;New Age sentiment&quot; which had come to pervade &quot;the socio-cultural landscape&quot; of Western countries. Its diffusion into the mainstream may have been influenced by the adoption of New Age concepts by high-profile figures: U.S. First Lady Nancy Reagan consulted an astrologer, British Princess Diana visited spirit mediums, and Norwegian Princess Märtha Louise established a school devoted to communicating with angels.
New Age shops continued to operate, although many have been remarketed as &quot;Mind, Body, Spirit&quot;.

In 2015, the scholar of religion Hugh Urban argued that New Age spirituality is growing in the United States and can be expected to become more visible: &quot;According to many recent surveys of religious affiliation, the &#x27;spiritual but not religious&#x27; category is one of the fastest-growing trends in American culture, so the New Age attitude of spiritual individualism and eclecticism may well be an increasingly visible one in the decades to come&quot;.

Australian scholar Paul J. Farrelly, in his 2017 doctoral dissertation at Australian National University, argued that, while the term New Age may become less popular in the West, it is actually booming in Taiwan, where it is regarded as something comparatively new and is being exported from Taiwan to the Mainland China, where it is more or less tolerated by the authorities.

==Beliefs and practices==
===Eclecticism and self-spirituality===
The New Age places strong emphasis on the idea that the individual and their own experiences are the primary source of authority on spiritual matters. It exhibits what Heelas termed &quot;unmediated individualism&quot;, and reflects a world-view that is &quot;radically democratic&quot;. It places an emphasis on the freedom and autonomy of the individual. This emphasis has led to ethical disagreements; some New Agers believe helping others is beneficial, although another view is that doing so encourages dependency and conflicts with a reliance on the self. Nevertheless, within the New Age, there are differences in the role accorded to voices of authority outside of the self. Hammer stated that &quot;a belief in the existence of a core or true Self&quot; is a &quot;recurring theme&quot; in New Age texts. The concept of &quot;personal growth&quot; is also greatly emphasised among New Agers, while Heelas noted that &quot;for participants spirituality &quot;is&quot; life-itself&quot;.

New Age religiosity is typified by its eclecticism. Generally believing that there is no one true way to pursue spirituality, New Agers develop their own worldview &quot;by combining bits and pieces to form their own individual mix&quot;, seeking what Drury called &quot;a spirituality without borders or confining dogmas&quot;. The anthropologist David J. Hess noted that in his experience, a common attitude among New Agers was that &quot;any alternative spiritual path is good because it is spiritual and alternative&quot;. This approach that has generated a common jibe that New Age represents &quot;supermarket spirituality&quot;. York suggested that this eclecticism stemmed from the New Age&#x27;s origins within late modern capitalism, with New Agers subscribing to a belief in a free market of spiritual ideas as a parallel to a free market in economics.

As part of its eclecticism, the New Age draws ideas from many different cultural and spiritual traditions from across the world, often legitimising this approach by reference to &quot;a very vague claim&quot; about underlying global unity. Certain societies are more usually chosen over others; examples include the ancient Celts, ancient Egyptians, the Essenes, Atlanteans, and ancient extraterrestrials. As noted by Hammer: &quot;to put it bluntly, no significant spokespersons within the New Age community claim to represent ancient Albanian wisdom, simply because beliefs regarding ancient Albanians are not part of our cultural stereotypes&quot;. According to Hess, these ancient or foreign societies represent an exotic &quot;Other&quot; for New Agers, who are predominantly white Westerners.

===Theology, cosmogony, and cosmology===

A belief in divinity is integral to New Age ideas, although understandings of this divinity vary. New Age theology exhibits an inclusive and universalistic approach that accepts all personal perspectives on the divine as equally valid. This intentional vagueness as to the nature of divinity also reflects the New Age idea that divinity cannot be comprehended by the human mind or language. New Age literature nevertheless displays recurring traits in its depiction of the divine: the first is the idea that it is holistic, thus frequently being described with such terms as an &quot;Ocean of Oneness&quot;, &quot;Infinite Spirit&quot;, &quot;Primal Stream&quot;, &quot;One Essence&quot;, and &quot;Universal Principle&quot;. A second trait is the characterisation of divinity as &quot;Mind&quot;, &quot;Consciousness&quot;, and &quot;Intelligence&quot;, while a third is the description of divinity as a form of &quot;energy&quot;. A fourth trait is the characterisation of divinity as a &quot;life force&quot;, the essence of which is creativity, while a fifth is the concept that divinity consists of love.

Most New Age groups believe in an Ultimate Source from which all things originate, which is usually conflated with the divine. Various creation myths have been articulated in New Age publications outlining how this Ultimate Source created the universe and everything in it. In contrast, some New Agers emphasize the idea of a universal inter-relatedness that is not always emanating from a single source. The New Age worldview emphasises holism and the idea that everything in existence is intricately connected as part of a single whole, in doing so rejecting both the dualism of the Christian division of matter and spirit and the reductionism of Cartesian science. A number of New Agers have linked this holistic interpretation of the universe to the Gaia hypothesis of James Lovelock. The idea of holistic divinity results in a common New Age belief that humans themselves are divine in essence, a concept described using such terms as &quot;droplet of divinity&quot;, &quot;inner Godhead&quot;, and &quot;divine self&quot;. Influenced by Theosophical and Anthroposophical ideas regarding &#x27;subtle bodies&#x27;, a common New Age idea holds to the existence of a Higher Self that is a part of the human but connects with the divine essence of the universe, and which can advise the human mind through intuition.

Cosmogonical creation stories are common in New Age sources, with these accounts reflecting the movement&#x27;s holistic framework by describing an original, primal oneness from which all things in the universe emanated. An additional common theme is that human souls—once living in a spiritual world—then descended into a world of matter.
The New Age movement typically views the material universe as a meaningful illusion, which humans should try to use constructively rather than focus on escaping into other spiritual realms. This physical world is hence seen as &quot;a domain for learning and growth&quot; after which the human soul might pass on to higher levels of existence. There is thus a widespread belief that reality is engaged in an ongoing process of evolution; rather than Darwinian evolution, this is typically seen as either a teleological evolution which assumes a process headed to a specific goal or an open-ended, creative evolution.

===Spirit and channeling===
A &quot;conduit&quot;, in esoterism, and spiritual discourse, is a specific object, person, location, or process (such as engaging in a séance or entering a trance, or using psychedelic medicines) which allows a person to connect or communicate with a spiritual realm, metaphysical energy, or spiritual entity, or vice versa. The use of such a conduit may be entirely metaphoric or symbolic, or it may be earnestly believed to be functional.

MacKian argued that a central, but often overlooked, element of the phenomenon was an emphasis on &quot;spirit&quot;, and in particular participants&#x27; desire for a relationship with spirit. Many practitioners in her UK-focused study described themselves as &quot;workers &quot;for&quot; spirit&quot;, expressing the desire to help people learn about spirit. They understood various material signs as marking the presence of spirit, for instance, the unexpected appearance of a feather. New Agers often call upon this spirit to assist them in everyday situations, for instance, to ease the traffic flow on their way to work.

New Age literature often refers to benevolent non-human spirit-beings who are interested in humanity&#x27;s spiritual development; these are variously referred to as angels, guardian angels, personal guides, masters, teachers, and contacts. New Age angelology is nevertheless unsystematic, reflecting the idiosyncrasies of individual authors. The figure of Jesus Christ is often mentioned within New Age literature as a mediating principle between divinity and humanity, as well as an exemplar of a spiritually advanced human being.

Although not present in every New Age group, a core belief within the milieu is in channeling. This is the idea that humans beings, sometimes (although not always) in a state of trance, can act &quot;as a channel of information from sources other than their normal selves&quot;. These sources are varyingly described as being God, gods and goddesses, ascended masters, spirit guides, extraterrestrials, angels, devas, historical figures, the collective unconscious, elementals, or nature spirits. Hanegraaff described channeling as a form of &quot;articulated revelation&quot;, and identified four forms: trance channeling, automatisms, clairaudient channeling, and open channeling.

A notable channeler in the early 1900s was Rose Edith Kelly, wife of the English occultist and ceremonial magician Aleister Crowley (1875–1947). She allegedly channeled the voice of a non-physical entity named Aiwass during their honeymoon in Cairo, Egypt (1904). Others purport to channel spirits from &quot;future dimensions&quot;, ascended masters, or, in the case of the trance mediums of the Brahma Kumaris, God. Another channeler in the early 1900s was Edgar Cayce, who said that he was able to channel his higher self while in a trance-like state.

In the later half of the 20th century, Western mediumship developed in two different ways. One type involves clairaudience, in which the medium is said to hear spirits and relay what they hear to their clients. The other is a form of channeling in which the channeler seemingly goes into a trance, and purports to leave their body allowing a spirit entity to borrow it and then speak through them. When in a trance the medium appears to enter into a cataleptic state, although modern channelers may not. Some channelers open the eyes when channeling, and remain able to walk and behave normally. The rhythm and the intonation of the voice may also change completely.

Examples of New Age channeling include Jane Roberts&#x27; belief that she was contacted by an entity called Seth, and Helen Schucman&#x27;s belief that she had channeled Jesus Christ. The academic Suzanne Riordan examined a variety of these New Age channeled messages, noting that they typically &quot;echoed each other in tone and content&quot;, offering an analysis of the human condition and giving instructions or advice for how humanity can discover its true destiny.
For many New Agers, these channeled messages rival the scriptures of the main world religions as sources of spiritual authority, although often New Agers describe historical religious revelations as forms of &quot;channeling&quot; as well, thus attempting to legitimate and authenticate their own contemporary practices. Although the concept of channeling from discarnate spirit entities has links to Spiritualism and psychical research, the New Age does not feature Spiritualism&#x27;s emphasis on proving the existence of life after death, nor psychical research&#x27;s focus of testing mediums for consistency.

Other New Age channels include:

* J. Z. Knight (b. 1946), who channels the spirit &quot;Ramtha&quot;, a 30-thousand-year-old man from Lemuria
* Esther Hicks (b. 1948), who channels a purported collective consciousness she calls &quot;Abraham&quot;
* Gary Douglas, who purportedly channels Grigori Rasputin, aliens called Novian, a 14th-century monk names Brother George, and an ancient Chinese man called Tchia Tsinin his organization, Access Consciousness.

===Astrological cycles and the Age of Aquarius===

New Age thought typically envisions the world as developing through cosmological cycles that can be identified astrologically. It adopts this concept from Theosophy, although often presents it in a looser and more eclectic way than is found in Theosophical teaching. New Age literature often proposes that humanity once lived in an age of spiritual wisdom. In the writings of New Agers like Edgar Cayce, the ancient period of spiritual wisdom is associated with concepts of supremely-advanced societies living on lost continents such as Atlantis, Lemuria, and Mu, as well as the idea that ancient societies like those of Ancient Egypt were far more technologically advanced than modern scholarship accepts. New Age literature often posits that the ancient period of spiritual wisdom gave way to an age of spiritual decline, sometimes termed the Age of Pisces. Although characterised as being a negative period for humanity, New Age literature views the Age of Pisces as an important learning experience for the species. Hanegraaff stated that New Age perceptions of history were &quot;extremely sketchy&quot; in their use of description, reflecting little interest in historiography and conflating history with myth. He also noted that they were highly ethnocentric in placing Western civilization at the centre of historical development.

A common belief among the New Age is that humanity has entered, or is coming to enter, a new period known as the Age of Aquarius, which Melton has characterised as a &quot;New Age of love, joy, peace, abundance, and harmony[...] the Golden Age heretofore only dreamed about.&quot; In accepting this belief in a coming new age, the milieu has been described as &quot;highly positive, celebratory, [and] utopian&quot;, and has also been cited as an apocalyptic movement. Opinions about the nature of the coming Age of Aquarius differ among New Agers. There are for instance differences in belief about its commencement; New Age author David Spangler wrote that it began in 1967, others placed its beginning with the Harmonic Convergence of 1987, author José Argüelles predicted its start in 2012, and some believe that it will not begin until several centuries into the third millennium.

There are also differences in how this new age is envisioned. Those adhering to what Hanegraaff termed the &quot;moderate&quot; perspective believed that it would be marked by an improvement to current society, which affected both New Age concerns—through the convergence of science and mysticism and the global embrace of alternative medicine—to more general concerns, including an end to violence, crime and war, a healthier environment, and international co-operation. Other New Agers adopt a fully utopian vision, believing that the world will be wholly transformed into an &quot;Age of Light&quot;, with humans evolving into totally spiritual beings and experiencing unlimited love, bliss, and happiness. Rather than conceiving of the Age of Aquarius as an indefinite period, many believe that it would last for around two thousand years before being replaced by a further age.

There are various beliefs within the milieu as to how this new age will come about, but most emphasise the idea that it will be established through human agency; others assert that it will be established with the aid of non-human forces such as spirits or extraterrestrials. Ferguson, for instance, said that there was a vanguard of humans known as the &quot;Aquarian conspiracy&quot; who were helping to bring the Age of Aquarius forth through their actions. Participants in the New Age typically express the view that their own spiritual actions are helping to bring about the Age of Aquarius, with writers like Ferguson and Argüelles presenting themselves as prophets ushering forth this future era.

===Healing and alternative medicine===
Another recurring element of New Age is an emphasis on healing and alternative medicine. The general New Age ethos is that health is the natural state for the human being and that illness is a disruption of that natural balance. Hence, New Age therapies seek to heal &quot;illness&quot; as a general concept that includes physical, mental, and spiritual aspects; in doing so it critiques mainstream Western medicine for simply attempting to cure disease, and thus has an affinity with most forms of traditional medicine. Its focus of self-spirituality has led to the emphasis of self-healing, although also present are ideas on healing both others and the Earth itself.

The healing elements of the movement are difficult to classify given that a variety of terms are used, with some New Age authors using different terms to refer to the same trends, while others use the same term to refer to different things. However, Hanegraaff developed a set of categories into which the forms of New Age healing could be roughly categorised. The first of these was the Human Potential Movement, which argues that contemporary Western society suppresses much human potential, and accordingly professes to offer a path through which individuals can access those parts of themselves that they have alienated and suppressed, thus enabling them to reach their full potential and live a meaningful life. Hanegraaff described transpersonal psychology as the &quot;theoretical wing&quot; of this Human Potential Movement; in contrast to other schools of psychological thought, transpersonal psychology takes religious and mystical experiences seriously by exploring the uses of altered states of consciousness. Closely connected to this is the shamanic consciousness current, which argues that the shaman was a specialist in altered states of consciousness and seeks to adopt and imitate traditional shamanic techniques as a form of personal healing and growth.

Hanegraaff identified the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being holistic health. This emerged in the 1970s out of the free clinic movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement. It emphasises the idea that the human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe. A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, with some of the most common including acupuncture, reiki, biofeedback, chiropractic, yoga, applied kinesiology, homeopathy, aromatherapy, iridology, massage and other forms of bodywork, meditation and visualisation, nutritional therapy, psychic healing, herbal medicine, healing using crystals, metals, music, chromotherapy, and reincarnation therapy. Although the use of crystal healing has become a visual trope within the New Age, this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.
The mainstreaming of the Holistic Health movement in the UK is discussed by Maria Tighe. The inter-relation of holistic health with the New Age movement is illustrated in Jenny Butler&#x27;s ethnographic description of &quot;Angel therapy&quot; in Ireland.

===New Age science===
According to Drury, the New Age attempts to create &quot;a worldview that includes both science and spirituality&quot;, while Hess noted how New Agers have &quot;a penchant for bringing together the technical and the spiritual, the scientific and the religious&quot;.
Although New Agers typically reject rationalism, the scientific method, and the academic establishment, they employ terminology and concepts borrowed from science and particularly from new physics. Moreover, a number of influences on New Age, such as David Bohm and Ilya Prigogine, had backgrounds as professional scientists. Hanegraaff identified &quot;New Age science&quot; as a form of &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot;.

In this, the milieu is interested in developing unified world views to discover the nature of the divine and establish a scientific basis for religious belief. Figures in the New Age movement—most notably Fritjof Capra in his &quot;The Tao of Physics&quot; (1975) and Gary Zukav in &quot;The Dancing Wu Li Masters&quot; (1979)—have drawn parallels between theories in the New Physics and traditional forms of mysticism, thus arguing that ancient religious ideas are now being proven by contemporary science. Many New Agers have adopted James Lovelock&#x27;s Gaia hypothesis that the Earth acts akin to a single living organism, going further to propound that the Earth has a consciousness and intelligence.

Despite New Agers&#x27; appeals to science, most of the academic and scientific establishments dismiss &quot;New Age science&quot; as pseudo-science, or at best existing in part on the fringes of genuine scientific research. This is an attitude also shared by many active in the field of parapsychology. In turn, New Agers often accuse the scientific establishment of pursuing a dogmatic and outmoded approach to scientific enquiry, believing that their own understandings of the universe will replace those of the academic establishment in a paradigm shift.

===Ethics and afterlife===
There is no ethical cohesion within the New Age phenomenon, although Hanegraaff argued that the central ethical tenet of the New Age is to cultivate one&#x27;s own divine potential. Given that the movement&#x27;s holistic interpretation of the universe prohibits a belief in a dualistic good and evil, negative events that happen are interpreted not as the result of evil but as lessons designed to teach an individual and enable them to advance spiritually.
It rejects the Christian emphasis on sin and guilt, believing that these generate fear and thus negativity, which then hinder spiritual evolution. It also typically criticises the blaming and judging of others for their actions, believing that if an individual adopts these negative attitudes it harms their own spiritual evolution. Instead, the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power behind such thoughts vary within New Age literature. Common New Age examples of how to generate such positive thinking include the repeated recitation of mantras and statements carrying positive messages, and the visualisation of a white light.

According to Hanegraaff, the question of death and afterlife is not a &quot;pressing problem requiring an answer&quot; in the New Age. A belief in reincarnation is very common, where it is often viewed as being part of an individual&#x27;s progressive spiritual evolution toward realisation of their own divinity. In New Age literature, the reality of reincarnation is usually treated as self-evident, with no explanation as to why practitioners embrace this afterlife belief over others, although New Agers endorse it in the belief that it ensures cosmic justice. Many New Agers believe in karma, treating it as a law of cause and effect that assures cosmic balance, although in some cases they stress that it is not a system that enforces punishment for past actions.
Much New Age literature on reincarnation says that part of the human soul, that which carries the personality, perishes with the death of the body, while the Higher Self—that which connects with divinity—survives in order to be reborn into another body. It is believed that the Higher Self chooses the body and circumstances into which it will be born, in order to use it as a vessel through which to learn new lessons and thus advance its own spiritual evolution. New Age writers like Shakti Gawain and Louise Hay therefore express the view that humans are responsible for the events that happen to them during their life, an idea that many New Agers regard as empowering. At times, past life regression are employed within the New Age in order to reveal a Higher Soul&#x27;s previous incarnations, usually with an explicit healing purpose. Some practitioners espouse the idea of a &quot;soul group&quot; or &quot;soul family&quot;, a group of connected souls who reincarnate together as family of friendship units. Rather than reincarnation, another afterlife belief found among New Agers holds that an individual&#x27;s soul returns to a &quot;universal energy&quot; on bodily death.

==Demographics==
In the mid-1990s, the New Age was found primarily in the United States and Canada, Western Europe, and Australia and New Zealand. The fact that most individuals engaging in New Age activity do not describe themselves as &quot;New Agers&quot; renders it difficult to determine the total number of practitioners. Heelas highlighted the range of attempts to establish the number of New Age participants in the U.S. during this period, noting that estimates ranged from 20,000 to 6 million; he believed that the higher ranges of these estimates were greatly inflated by, for instance, an erroneous assumption that all Americans who believed in reincarnation were part of the New Age. He nevertheless suggested that over 10 million people in the U.S. had had some contact with New Age practices or ideas. Between 2000 and 2002, Heelas and Woodhead conducted research into the New Age in the English town of Kendal, Cumbria; they found 600 people actively attended New Age activities on a weekly basis, representing 1.6% of the town&#x27;s population. From this, they extrapolated that around 900,000 Britons regularly took part in New Age activities. In 2006, Heelas stated that New Age practices had grown to such an extent that they were &quot;increasingly rivaling the sway of Christianity in Western settings&quot;.

Sociological investigation indicates that certain sectors of society are more likely to engage in New Age practices than others. In the United States, the first people to embrace the New Age belonged to the baby boomer generation, those born between 1946 and 1964.

Sutcliffe noted that although most influential New Age figureheads were male, approximately two-thirds of its participants were female. Heelas and Woodhead&#x27;s Kendal Project found that of those regularly attending New Age activities in the town, 80% were female, while 78% of those running such activities were female. They attributed this female dominance to &quot;deeply entrenched cultural values and divisions of labour&quot; in Western society, according to which women were accorded greater responsibility for the well-being of others, thus making New Age practices more attractive to them. They suggested that men were less attracted to New Age activities because they were hampered by a &quot;masculinist ideal of autonomy and self-sufficiency&quot; which discouraged them from seeking the assistance of others for their inner development.

The majority of New Agers are from the middle and upper-middle classes of Western society. Heelas and Woodhead found that of the active Kendal New Agers, 57% had a university or college degree. Their Kendal Project also determined that 73% of active New Agers were aged over 45, and 55% were aged between 40 and 59; it also determined that many got involved while middle-aged. Comparatively few were either young or elderly. Heelas and Woodhead suggested that the dominance of middle-aged people, particularly women, was because at this stage of life they had greater time to devote to their own inner development, with their time previously having been dominated by raising children. They also suggested that middle-aged people were experiencing more age-related ailments than the young, and thus more keen to pursue New Age activities to improve their health.

Heelas added that within the baby boomers, the movement had nevertheless attracted a diverse clientele. He typified the typical New Ager as someone who was well-educated yet disenchanted with mainstream society, thus arguing that the movement catered to those who believe that modernity is in crisis. He suggested that the movement appealed to many former practitioners of the 1960s counter-culture because while they came to feel that they were unable to change society, they were nonetheless interested in changing the self. He believed that many individuals had been &quot;culturally primed for what the New Age has to offer&quot;, with the New Age attracting &quot;expressive&quot; people who were already comfortable with the ideals and outlooks of the movement&#x27;s self-spirituality focus. It could be particularly appealing because the New Age suited the needs of the individual, whereas traditional religious options that are available primarily catered for the needs of a community. He believed that although the adoption of New Age beliefs and practices by some fitted the model of religious conversion, others who adopted some of its practices could not easily be considered to have converted to the religion. Sutcliffe described the &quot;typical&quot; participant in the New Age milieu as being &quot;a religious individualist, mixing and matching cultural resources in an animated spiritual quest&quot;.

The degree to which individuals are involved in the New Age varies. Heelas argued that those involved could be divided into three broad groups; the first comprised those who were completely dedicated to it and its ideals, often working in professions that furthered those goals. The second consisted of &quot;serious part-timers&quot; who worked in unrelated fields but who nevertheless spent much of their free time involved in movement activities. The third was that of &quot;casual part-timers&quot; who occasionally involved themselves in New Age activities but for whom the movement was not a central aspect of their life. MacKian instead suggested that involvement could be seen as being layered like an onion; at the core are &quot;consultative&quot; practitioners who devote their life to New Age practices, around that are &quot;serious&quot; practitioners who still invest considerable effort into New Age activities, and on the periphery are &quot;non-practitioner consumers&quot;, individuals affected by the general dissemination of New Age ideas but who do not devote themselves more fully to them. Many New Age practices have filtered into wider Western society, with a 2000 poll, for instance, revealing that 39% of the UK population had tried alternative therapies.

In 1995, Kyle stated that on the whole, New Agers in the United States preferred the values of the Democratic Party over those of the Republican Party. He added that most New Agers &quot;soundly rejected&quot; the agenda of former Republican President Ronald Reagan.

===Social communities===
MacKian suggested that this phenomenon was &quot;an inherently &quot;social&quot; mode of spirituality&quot;, one which cultivated a sense of belonging among its participants and encouraged relations both with other humans and with non-human, otherworldly spirit entities.
MacKian suggested that these communities &quot;may look very different&quot; from those of traditional religious groups.

Online connections were one of the ways that interested individuals met new contacts and established networks.

==Commercial aspects==
Some New Agers advocate living in a simple and sustainable manner to reduce humanity&#x27;s impact on the natural resources of Earth; and they shun consumerism. The New Age movement has been centered around rebuilding a sense of community to counter social disintegration; this has been attempted through the formation of intentional communities, where individuals come together to live and work in a communal lifestyle. New Age centres have been set up in various parts of the world, representing an institutionalised form of the movement. Notable examples include the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado, Holly Hock Farm near to Vancouver, the Wrekin Trust in West Malvern, Worcestershire, and the Skyros Centre in Skyros. Criticising mainstream Western education as counterproductive to the ethos of the movement, many New Age groups have established their own schools for the education of children, although in other cases such groups have sought to introduce New Age spiritual techniques into pre-existing establishments.

Bruce argued that in seeking to &quot;denying the validity of externally imposed controls and privileging the divine within&quot;, the New Age sought to dismantle pre-existing social order, but that it failed to present anything adequate in its place. Heelas, however, cautioned that Bruce had arrived at this conclusion based on &quot;flimsy evidence&quot;, and Aldred argued that only a minority of New Agers participate in community-focused activities; instead, she argued, the majority of New Agers participate mainly through the purchase of books and products targeted at the New Age market, positioning New Age as a primarily consumerist and commercial movement.

===Fairs and festivals===
New Age spirituality has led to a wide array of literature on the subject and an active niche market, with books, music, crafts, and services in alternative medicine available at New Age stores, fairs, and festivals.
New Age fairs—sometimes known as &quot;Mind, Body, Spirit fairs&quot;, &quot;psychic fairs&quot;, or &quot;alternative health fairs&quot;—are spaces in which a variety of goods and services are displayed by different vendors, including forms of alternative medicine and esoteric practices such as palmistry or tarot card reading. An example is the Mind Body Spirit Festival, held annually in the United Kingdom, at which—the religious studies scholar Christopher Partridge noted—one could encounter &quot;a wide range of beliefs and practices from crystal healing to ... Kirlian photography to psychic art, from angels to past-life therapy, from Theosophy to UFO religion, and from New Age music to the vegetarianism of Suma Chign Hai.&quot; Similar festivals are held across Europe and in Australia and the United States.

===Approaches to financial prosperity and business===
A number of New Age proponents have emphasised the use of spiritual techniques as a tool for attaining financial prosperity, thus moving the movement away from its counter-cultural origins. Commenting on this &quot;New Age capitalism&quot;, Hess observed that it was largely small-scale and entrepreneurial, focused around small companies run by members of the petite bourgeoisie, rather than being dominated by large scale multinational corporations. The links between New Age and commercial products have resulted in the accusation that New Age itself is little more than a manifestation of consumerism. This idea is generally rejected by New Age participants, who often reject any link between their practices and consumerist activities.

Embracing this attitude, various books have been published espousing such an ethos, established New Age centres have held spiritual retreats and classes aimed specifically at business people, and New Age groups have developed specialised training for businesses. During the 1980s, many U.S. corporations—among them IBM, AT&amp;T, and General Motors—embraced New Age seminars, hoping that they could increase productivity and efficiency among their workforce, although in several cases this resulted in employees bringing legal action against their employers, saying that such seminars had infringed on their religious beliefs or damaged their psychological health. However, the use of spiritual techniques as a method for attaining profit has been an issue of major dispute within the wider New Age movement, with New Agers such as Spangler and Matthew Fox criticising what they see as trends within the community that are narcissistic and lack a social conscience. In particular, the movement&#x27;s commercial elements have caused problems given that they often conflict with its general economically egalitarian ethos; as York highlighted, &quot;a tension exists in New Age between socialistic egalitarianism and capitalistic private enterprise&quot;.

Given that it encourages individuals to choose spiritual practices on the grounds of personal preference and thus encourages them to behave as a consumer, the New Age has been considered to be well suited to modern society.

===Music===
The term &quot;new-age music&quot; is applied, sometimes negatively, to forms of ambient music, a genre that developed in the 1960s and was popularised in the 1970s, particularly with the work of Brian Eno. The genre&#x27;s relaxing nature resulted in it becoming popular within New Age circles, with some forms of the genre having a specifically New Age orientation. Studies have determined that new-age music can be an effective component of stress management.

The style began in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the works of free-form jazz groups recording on the ECM label; such as Oregon, the Paul Winter Consort, and other pre-ambient bands; as well as ambient music performer Brian Eno, classical avant-garde musician Daniel Kobialka, and the psychoacoustic &quot;environments&quot; recordings of Irv Teibel. In the early 1970s, it was mostly instrumental with both acoustic and electronic styles. New-age music evolved to include a wide range of styles from electronic space music using synthesizers and acoustic instrumentals using Native American flutes and drums, singing bowls, Australian didgeridoos and world music sounds to spiritual chanting from other cultures.

==Politics==
While many commentators have focused on the spiritual and cultural aspects of the New Age movement, it also has a political component. The New Age political movement became visible in the 1970s, peaked in the 1980s, and continued into the 1990s. The sociologist of religion Steven Bruce noted that the New Age provides ideas on how to deal with &quot;our socio-psychological problems&quot;. Scholar of religion James R. Lewis observed that, despite the common caricature of New Agers as narcissistic, &quot;significant numbers&quot; of them were &quot;trying to make the planet a better place on which to live,&quot; and scholar J. Gordon Melton&#x27;s &quot;New Age Encyclopedia&quot; (1990) included an entry called &quot;New Age politics&quot;. Some New Agers have entered the political system in an attempt to advocate for the societal transformation that the New Age promotes.

===Ideas===
Although New Age activists have been motivated by New Age concepts like holism, interconnectedness, monism, and environmentalism, their political ideas are diverse, ranging from far-right and conservative through to liberal, socialist, and libertarian. Accordingly, Kyle stated that &quot;New Age politics is difficult to describe and categorize. The standard political labels—left or right, liberal or conservative—miss the mark.&quot; MacKian suggested that the New Age operated as a form of &quot;world-realigning infrapolitics&quot; that undermines the disenchantment of modern Western society.

The extent to which New Age spokespeople mix religion and politics varies. New Agers are often critical of the established political order, regarding it as &quot;fragmented, unjust, hierarchical, patriarchal, and obsolete&quot;. The New Ager Mark Satin for instance spoke of &quot;New Age politics&quot; as a politically radical &quot;third force&quot; that was &quot;neither left nor right&quot;. He believed that in contrast to the conventional political focus on the &quot;institutional and economic symptoms&quot; of society&#x27;s problems, his &quot;New Age politics&quot; would focus on &quot;psychocultural roots&quot; of these issues. Ferguson regarded New Age politics as &quot;a kind of Radical Centre&quot;, one that was &quot;not neutral, not middle-of-the-road, but a view of the whole road.&quot; Fritjof Capra argued that Western societies have become sclerotic because of their adherence to an outdated and mechanistic view of reality, which he calls the &quot;Newtonian/Cartesian paradigm&quot;. In Capra&#x27;s view, the West needs to develop an organic and ecological &quot;systems view&quot; of reality in order to successfully address its social and political issues. Corinne McLaughlin argued that politics need not connote endless power struggles, that a new &quot;spiritual politics&quot; could attempt to synthesize opposing views on issues into higher levels of understanding.

Many New Agers advocate globalisation and localisation, but reject nationalism and the role of the nation-state. Some New Age spokespeople have called for greater decentralisation and global unity, but are vague about how this might be achieved; others call for a global, centralised government. Satin for example argued for a move away from the nation-state and towards self-governing regions that, through improved global communication networks, would help engender world unity. Benjamin Creme conversely argued that &quot;the Christ&quot;, a great Avatar, Maitreya, the World Teacher, expected by all the major religions as their &quot;Awaited One&quot;, would return to the world and establish a strong, centralised global government in the form of the United Nations; this would be politically re-organised along a spiritual hierarchy. Kyle observed that New Agers often speak favourably of democracy and citizens&#x27; involvement in policy making but are critical of representative democracy and majority rule, thus displaying elitist ideas to their thinking.

===Groups===
Scholars have noted several New Age political groups. Self-Determination: A Personal/Political Network, lauded by Ferguson and Satin, was described at length by sociology of religion scholar Steven Tipton. Founded in 1975 by California state legislator John Vasconcellos and others, it encouraged Californians to engage in personal growth work and political activities at the same time, especially at the grassroots level. Hanegraaff noted another California-based group, the Institute of Noetic Sciences, headed by the author Willis Harman. It advocated a change in consciousness—in &quot;basic underlying assumptions&quot;—in order to come to grips with global crises. Kyle said that the New York City–based Planetary Citizens organization, headed by United Nations consultant and &quot;Earth at Omega&quot; author Donald Keys, sought to implement New Age political ideas.

Scholar J. Gordon Melton and colleagues focused on the New World Alliance, a Washington, DC–based organization founded in 1979 by Mark Satin and others. According to Melton et al., the Alliance tried to combine left- and right-wing ideas as well as personal growth work and political activities. Group decision-making was facilitated by short periods of silence. Sponsors of the Alliance&#x27;s national political newsletter included Willis Harman and John Vasconcellos. Scholar James R. Lewis counted &quot;Green politics&quot; as one of the New Age&#x27;s more visible activities. One academic book says that the U.S. Green Party movement began as an initiative of a handful of activists including Charlene Spretnak, co-author of a &quot;&#x27;new age&#x27; interpretation&quot; of the German Green movement (Capra and Spretnak&#x27;s &quot;Green Politics&quot;), and Mark Satin, author of &quot;New Age Politics&quot;. Another academic publication says Spretnak and Satin largely co-drafted the U.S. Greens&#x27; founding document, the &quot;Ten Key Values&quot; statement.

===In the 21st century===
While the term &quot;New Age&quot; may have fallen out of favor, scholar George Chryssides notes that the New Age by whatever name is &quot;still alive and active&quot; in the 21st century. In the realm of politics, New Ager Mark Satin&#x27;s book &quot;Radical Middle&quot; (2004) reached out to mainstream liberals. York (2005) identified &quot;key New Age spokespeople&quot; including William Bloom, Satish Kumar, and Starhawk who were emphasizing a link between spirituality and environmental consciousness. Former Esalen Institute staffer Stephen Dinan&#x27;s &quot;Sacred America, Sacred World&quot; (2016) prompted a long interview of Dinan in &quot;Psychology Today&quot;, which called the book a &quot;manifesto for our country&#x27;s evolution that is both political and deeply spiritual&quot;.

In 2013 longtime New Age author Marianne Williamson launched a campaign for a seat in the United States House of Representatives, telling &quot;The New York Times&quot; that her type of spirituality was what American politics needed. &quot;America has swerved from its ethical center&quot;, she said. Running as an independent in west Los Angeles, she finished fourth in her district&#x27;s open primary election with 13% of the vote. In early 2019, Williamson announced her candidacy for the Democratic Party nomination for president of the United States in the 2020 United States presidential election. A 5,300-word article about her presidential campaign in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said she had &quot;plans to fix America with love. Tough love&quot;. In January 2020 she withdrew her bid for the nomination.

==Reception==
===Popular media===

Mainstream periodicals tended to be less than sympathetic; sociologist Paul Ray and psychologist Sherry Anderson discussed in their 2000 book &quot;The Cultural Creatives&quot;, what they called the media&#x27;s &quot;zest for attacking&quot; New Age ideas, and offered the example of a 1996 Lance Morrow essay in &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Nearly a decade earlier, &quot;Time&quot; had run a long cover story critical of New Age culture; the cover featured a headshot of a famous actress beside the headline, &quot;Om... THE NEW AGE starring Shirley MacLaine, faith healers, channelers, space travelers, and crystals galore&quot;. The story itself, by former &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; editor Otto Friedrich, was sub-titled, &quot;A Strange Mix of Spirituality and Superstition Is Sweeping Across the Country&quot;. In 1988, the magazine &quot;The New Republic&quot; ran a four-page critique of New Age culture and politics by a journalist Richard Blow entitled simply, &quot;Moronic Convergence&quot;.

Some New Agers and New Age sympathizers responded to such criticisms. For example, sympathizers Ray and Anderson said that much of it was an attempt to &quot;stereotype&quot; the movement for idealistic and spiritual change, and to cut back on its popularity. New Age theoretician David Spangler tried to distance himself from what he called the &quot;New Age glamour&quot; of crystals, talk-show channelers, and other easily commercialized phenomena, and sought to underscore his commitment to the New Age as a vision of genuine social transformation.

===Academia===
Initially, academic interest in the New Age was minimal. The earliest academic studies of the New Age phenomenon were performed by specialists in the study of new religious movements such as Robert Ellwood. This research was often scanty because many scholars regarded the New Age as an insignificant cultural fad. Having been influenced by the U.S. anti-cult movement, much of it was also largely negative and critical of New Age groups. The &quot;first truly scholarly study&quot; of the phenomenon was an edited volume put together by James R. Lewis and J. Gordon Melton in 1992. From that point on, the number of published academic studies steadily increased.

In 1994, Christoph Bochinger published his study of the New Age in Germany, &quot;&quot;New Age&quot; und moderne Religion&quot;. This was followed by Michael York&#x27;s sociological study in 1995 and Richard Kyle&#x27;s U.S.-focused work in 1995. In 1996, Paul Heelas published a sociological study of the movement in Britain, being the first to discuss its relationship with business. That same year, Wouter Hanegraaff published &quot;New Age Religion and Western Culture&quot;, a historical analysis of New Age texts; Hammer later described it as having &quot;a well-deserved reputation as the standard reference work on the New Age&quot;. Most of these early studies were based on a textual analysis of New Age publications, rather than on an ethnographic analysis of its practitioners.

Sutcliffe and Gilhus argued that &#x27;New Age studies&#x27; could be seen as having experienced two waves; in the first, scholars focused on &quot;macro-level analyses of the content and boundaries&quot; of the &quot;movement&quot;, while the second wave featured &quot;more variegated and contextualized studies of particular beliefs and practices&quot;. Sutcliffe and Gilhus have also expressed concern that, as of 2013, &#x27;New Age studies&#x27; has yet to formulate a set of research questions scholars can pursue.
The New Age has proved a challenge for scholars of religion operating under more formative models of what &quot;religion&quot; is. By 2006, Heelas noted that the New Age was so vast and diverse that no scholar of the subject could hope to keep up with all of it.

===Christian perspectives===
Mainstream Christianity has typically rejected the ideas of the New Age; Christian critiques often emphasise that the New Age places the human individual before God. Most published criticism of the New Age has been produced by Christians, particularly those on the religion&#x27;s fundamentalist wing. In the United States, the New Age became a major concern of evangelical Christian groups in the 1980s, an attitude that influenced British evangelical groups. During that decade, evangelical writers such as Constance Cumbey, Dave Hunt, Gary North, and Douglas Groothuis published books criticising the New Age; a number propagated conspiracy theories regarding its origin and purpose. The most successful such publication was Frank E. Peretti&#x27;s 1986 novel &quot;This Present Darkness&quot;, which sold over a million copies; it depicted the New Age as being in league with feminism and secular education as part of a conspiracy to overthrow Christianity. Modern Christian critics of the New Age include Doreen Virtue, a former New Age writer from California who converted to fundamentalist Christianity in 2017.

Official responses to the New Age have been produced by major Christian organisations like the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of England, and the Methodist Church. The Roman Catholic Church published &quot;A Christian reflection on the New Age&quot; in 2003, following a six-year study; the 90-page document criticizes New Age practices such as yoga, meditation, feng shui, and crystal healing. According to the Vatican, euphoric states attained through New Age practices should not be confused with prayer or viewed as signs of God&#x27;s presence. Cardinal Paul Poupard, then-president of the Pontifical Council for Culture, said the New Age is &quot;a misleading answer to the oldest hopes of man&quot;. Monsignor Michael Fitzgerald, then-president of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, stated at the Vatican conference on the document: the &quot;Church avoids any concept that is close to those of the New Age&quot;. On the contrary, some fringe Christian groups have adopted a more positive view of the New Age, among them the Christaquarians, and Christians Awakening to a New Awareness, all of which believe that New Age ideas can enhance a person&#x27;s Christian faith.

===Contemporary Pagan perspectives===

There is academic debate about the connection between the New Age and Modern Paganism, sometimes termed &quot;Neo-paganism&quot;. The two phenomena have often been confused and conflated, particularly in Christian critiques. Religious studies scholar Sarah Pike asserted that there was a &quot;significant overlap&quot; between the two religious movements, while Aidan A. Kelly stated that Paganism &quot;parallels the New Age movement in some ways, differs sharply from it in others, and overlaps it in some minor ways&quot;. Other scholars have identified them as distinct phenomena that share overlap and commonalities. Hanegraaff suggested that whereas various forms of contemporary Paganism were not part of the New Age movement—particularly those that pre-dated the movement—other Pagan religions and practices could be identified as New Age. Partridge portrayed both Paganism and the New Age as different streams of occulture (occult culture) that merge at points.

Various differences between the two movements have been highlighted; the New Age movement focuses on an improved future, whereas the focus of Paganism is on the pre-Christian past. Similarly, the New Age movement typically propounds a universalist message that sees all religions as fundamentally the same, whereas Paganism stresses the difference between monotheistic religions and those embracing a polytheistic or animistic theology. While the New Age emphasises a light-centred image, Paganism acknowledges both light and dark, life and death, and recognises the savage side of the natural world. Many Pagans have sought to distance themselves from the New Age movement, even using &quot;New Age&quot; as an insult within their community, while conversely many involved in the New Age have expressed criticism of Paganism for emphasizing the material world over the spiritual. Many Pagans have expressed criticism of the high fees charged by New Age teachers, something not typically present in the Pagan movement.

===Non-Western and Indigenous criticism===
New Age often adopts spiritual ideas and practices from other, particularly non-Western cultures. According to York, these may include &quot;Hawaiian Kahuna magic, Australian Aboriginal dream-working, South American Amerindian &quot;ayahuasca&quot; and &quot;San Pedro&quot; ceremonies, Hindu Ayurveda and yoga, Chinese Feng Shui, Qi Gong, and Tai Chi.&quot;

The New Age has been accused of cultural imperialism, misappropriating sacred ceremonies, and exploitation of the intellectual and cultural property of Indigenous peoples. Indigenous American spiritual leaders, such as Elders councils of the Lakota, Cheyenne, Navajo, Creek, Hopi, Chippewa, and Haudenosaunee have denounced New Age misappropriation of their sacred ceremonies and other intellectual property, stating that &quot;[t]he value of these instructions and ceremonies [when led by unauthorized people] are questionable, maybe meaningless, and hurtful to the individual carrying false messages&quot;. Traditional leaders of the Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota peoples have reached consensus to reject &quot;the expropriation of [their] ceremonial ways by non-Indians&quot;. They see the New Age movement as either not fully understanding, deliberately trivializing, or distorting their way of life, and strongly disapprove of all such &quot;plastic medicine people&quot; who are appropriating their spiritual ways.

Indigenous leaders have spoken out against individuals from within their own communities who may go out into the world to become a &quot;white man&#x27;s shaman&quot;, and any &quot;who are prostituting our spiritual ways for their own selfish gain, with no regard for the spiritual well-being of the people as a whole&quot;. The terms &quot;plastic shaman&quot; and &quot;plastic medicine person&quot; have been used to describe an outsider who identifies or promotes themselves as a shaman, holy person, or other traditional spiritual leader, yet has no genuine connection to the traditions or cultures represented.

===Political writers and activists===
Toward the end of the 20th century, some social and political analysts and activists were arguing that the New Age political perspective had something to offer mainstream society. In 1987, some political scientists launched the &quot;Section on Ecological and Transformational Politics&quot; of the American Political Science Association, and an academic book prepared by three of them stated that the &quot;transformational politics&quot; concept was meant to subsume such terms as &quot;new age&quot; and &quot;new paradigm&quot;. In 1991, scholar of cultural studies Andrew Ross suggested that New Age political ideas—however muddled and naïve—could help progressives construct an appealing alternative to both atomistic individualism and self-denying collectivism. In 2005, British researcher Stuart Rose urged scholars of alternative religions to pay more attention to the New Age&#x27;s interest in such topics as &quot;new socio-political thinking&quot; and &quot;New Economics&quot;, topics Rose discussed in his book &quot;Transforming the World: Bringing the New Age Into Focus&quot;, issued by a European academic publisher.

Other political thinkers and activists saw New Age politics less positively. On the political right, author George Weigel argued that New Age politics was just a retooled and pastel-colored version of leftism. Conservative evangelical writer Douglas Groothuis, discussed by scholars Hexham and Kemp, warned that New Age politics could lead to an oppressive world government. On the left, scholars argued that New Age politics was an oxymoron: that personal growth has little or nothing to do with political change. One political scientist said New Age politics fails to recognize the reality of economic and political power. Another academic, Dana L. Cloud, wrote a lengthy critique of New Age politics as a political ideology; she faulted it for not being opposed to the capitalist system, or to liberal individualism.

A criticism of New Age often made by leftists is that its focus on individualism deflects participants from engaging in socio-political activism. This perspective regards New Age as a manifestation of consumerism that promotes elitism and indulgence by allowing wealthier people to affirm their socio-economic status through consuming New Age products and therapies. New Agers who do engage in socio-political activism have also been criticized. Journalist Harvey Wasserman suggested that New Age activists were too averse to social conflict to be effective politically. Melton et al. found that New Age activists&#x27; commitment to the often frustrating process of consensus decision-making led to &quot;extended meetings and minimal results&quot;, and a pair of futurists concluded that one once-promising New Age activist group had been both &quot;too visionary and too vague&quot; to last.

<text>is a Japanese manga artist. She is best known as the author of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, one of the most popular manga series of all time. She has won several awards, including the 1993 Kodansha Manga Award for &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;.

Takeuchi is married to Yoshihiro Togashi, the author of &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; and &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot;.

==Early life==
Takeuchi was born in Kofu, Yamanashi, Japan to Kenji and Ikuko Takeuchi. She has a younger brother, Shingo. She gave the names of her relatives to the characters she created for &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, and mentions this in interviews and in several comic strips she produced, in place of author notes.

Takeuchi attended Kofu Ichi High School, where she wore a sailor uniform and joined the astronomy and manga clubs. These experiences influenced her work for &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, in addition to her other pieces, such as &quot;Love Call&quot; and &quot;Rain Kiss&quot;. Her formative high school experiences influenced her trajectory to become a manga artist. Takeuchi&#x27;s father encouraged her to pursue other career paths, in case she wouldn&#x27;t find success as a professional artist, which is why she attended university to study chemistry.

Takeuchi graduated from the Kyoritsu College of Pharmacy, where she received a degree in chemistry and became a licensed pharmacist. Her senior thesis was called &quot;Heightened Effects of Thrombolytic Actions Due to Ultrasound&quot;.

==Career==

===1986–1997: Early work and success===
After graduating from the Kyoritsu College of Pharmacy, at the age of 19, Takeuchi entered the manga industry by submitting her work &quot;Love Call&quot; to Kodansha; Takeuchi received Nakayoshi&#x27;s New Artist award for &quot;Love Call&quot;. She worked steadily on one-shot pieces until writing &quot;Maria&quot;, which was published in &quot;Nakayoshi&quot; from early to mid-1990. This work, Takeuchi&#x27;s first serial comic, was loosely based on Jean Webster&#x27;s 1912 novel &quot;Daddy-Long-Legs&quot; and on her friend Marie Koizumi, who helped write it.

After completing &quot;Maria&quot;, Takeuchi worked on the ice-skating series &quot;The Cherry Project&quot;, which was serialized in &quot;Nakayoshi&quot; from late 1990 to 1991. While working on &quot;The Cherry Project&quot;, Takeuchi wanted to do a manga on outer space and girl fighters. Her editor, Fumio Osano, asked her to put the fighters in sailor suits. This concept would later become a one-shot called &quot;&quot;, which would later begin serialization in &quot;RunRun&quot;. When Toei Animation planned to adapt her manga into an anime series, she reworked &quot;Sailor V&quot; and added four other superheroines.

In December 1991, &quot;Nakayoshi&quot; began serializing &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, which became an instant hit. The success encouraged Takeuchi to work on both &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; and &quot;Sailor V&quot; from 1991 to 1997. However, &quot;RunRun&quot; was canceled with the November 1997 issue, and the planned &quot;Sailor V&quot; anime adaptation was canceled along with it. During that six-year period, she produced 60 chapters, which were collected in 18 volumes. The success of the manga led to a 200-episode anime adaptation, three animated films, numerous video games, and wide-ranging merchandising.

She had an interview with Silent Möbius creator, Kia Asamiya.

At the series&#x27; end, Takeuchi worked on &quot;PQ Angels&quot; for &quot;Nakayoshi&quot;. This gained a fair amount of popularity, but was canceled due to Kodansha losing seven pages of her manuscript. Takeuchi said that Toei Animation had the manuscript, therefore it would have been possible to create an anime adaptation of the series.

Takeuchi&#x27;s own studio is called &quot;Princess Naoko Planning&quot; (PNP). Takeuchi established PNP to manage her properties, mainly &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;. The studio later encompassed Yoshihiro Togashi&#x27;s work as well and appeared in the credits for such anime as &quot;Level E&quot; and &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot;. Its name also appears on the musical credits for &quot;Shin Kaguya Shima Densetsu&quot; and other projects.

===1998–2009===
Following the loss of seven pages of Takeuchi&#x27;s &quot;PQ Angels&quot; manuscript, Osano departed Kodansha and the plans for the &quot;Materials Collection&quot; were canceled. Takeuchi departed Kodansha for Shueisha.

On August 13, 1998, Takeuchi made her first appearance in the United States at San Diego Comic-Con for three days. That same year, she published the first &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; artbook since her departure from Kodansha, &quot;Sailor Moon Infinity Collection Art Book&quot; with limited releases.

While working on her short comic strip &quot;Princess Naoko Takeuchi Back-to-Work Punch!!&quot;, Takeuchi met Yoshihiro Togashi at a &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; meeting hosted by Kazushi Hagiwara, and had a meeting arranged between them by voice actress Megumi Ogata. She collaborated with Togashi as an assistant (doing screentone) and as a manager on volume 1 of &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot;. However, the work and the demands proved more than she had expected, and as a result, Takeuchi left Shueisha.

Around this time, Takeuchi conceived the idea for a one-shot called &quot;Toki☆Meka&quot;, which eventually turned into &quot;Toki☆Meca&quot;. Togashi had a similar idea at the same time as her, but never fully brought it to fruition. He helped somewhat with &quot;Toki☆Meka&quot; at this point in developing the idea by drawing some concept sketches, which Takeuchi showed in &quot;Toki☆Meca&quot; volume 1.

Togashi and Takeuchi married in 1999. From this marriage, the couple have two children: a son, born in January 2001, and a daughter, born in 2009.

After Kodansha&#x27;s rights to &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; expired, Takeuchi returned to the publisher in 1999 to develop and publish the &quot;Materials Collection&quot;. She also began serializing &quot;Love Witch&quot;, but it was cancelled. Takeuchi started to work on the reprints of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; and &quot;Sailor V&quot;, and published &quot;Toki☆Meca&quot; in &quot;Nakayoshi&quot;.

In 2003, Takeuchi became heavily involved in producing &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot;, a tokusatsu television series based on &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, as she had an interest in learning more about the anime industry. This culminated in the creation of &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot;. The series displays a plot that is heavily reliant on the manga and also explores many themes that the manga was unable to explore. She showed up at the official conference with a fist up, meaning &quot;good luck&quot;, in Act Zero.

After the production of &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot; ended in 2004, Takeuchi continued to work on &quot;Toki☆Meca&quot;. During the manga&#x27;s serialization, Osano returned as her editor. Takeuchi also worked more closely with managing PNP and gave talks to college students. At the same time, she wrote a children&#x27;s book titled &quot;Oboo-nu- to Chiboo-nu-&quot; as a birthday present to her son. (Togashi provided illustrations for the book; Takeuchi made mention of this in the back of the first volume of &quot;Toki☆Meca&quot;.) She still works on the website, updating it about once a month with new flash animations or profiles.

===2010–2019===
In 2012, it was announced that a new &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; anime adaptation was in development. With it, Takeuchi started a &quot;Kanzenban&quot; version of the manga, which was announced by Osano, and will include fixed past mistakes and new covers for the manga. Color pages are also included for the title pages. There was also an artbook announced, and she has been working on merchandise, which was announced by Osano on his Twitter feed.

The new reboot anime, &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, debuted in July 2014. It streamed on Niconico bi-weekly, and ended in July 2015, spanning a total of 26 episodes, which cover the &quot;Dark Kingdom&quot; and &quot;Black Moon&quot; arc of the manga. Takeuchi wrote the ending theme song, , under her penname, . The series eventually gained its 13-episode third season, &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Crystal Season III&quot;, covering the &quot;Infinity&quot; arc of the manga (known as &quot;Death Busters&quot; in Japan), and aired weekly on Japanese television from April to June 2016.

===2020–present===
In 2020, the two volumes of official of the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; manga was released on June 29, with Takeuchi providing new illustrations for both covers.

In 2021, Takeuchi chief supervised the production of the two-part anime film, &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal The Movie&quot;, which adapted the &quot;Dream&quot; arc of the manga (known as &quot;Dead Moon&quot; in Japan), and acted as a &quot;fourth season&quot; for the &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot; series. Both films were released in 2021 in Japanese theaters, with the first film on January 8, and the second film on February 11. Takeuchi also provided the lyrics for the theme song, , under the name of &quot;Sumire Shirobara&quot;.

In 2022, Takeuchi chief supervised the production of the sequel to &quot;Sailor Moon Eternal&quot;, titled &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Cosmos The Movie&quot;. The two-part film covered the &quot;Stars&quot; arc of the manga (known as &quot;Shadow Galactica&quot; in Japan), and acted as a &quot;fifth and final season&quot; for the &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot; series. Both films were released in June 2023, with the first film on the 9th, and the second film on the 30th.

<doc id="21746" wikidata="Q1733896" url="?curid=21746" title="Nolo contendere">
<text>Nolo contendere () is a type of legal plea used in some jurisdictions in the United States. It is also referred to as a plea of no contest or no defense. It is a plea where the defendant neither admits nor disputes a charge, serving as an alternative to a pleading of guilty or not guilty. A no-contest plea means that defendants refuse to admit guilt but accept punishment as if guilty, and is often offered as a part of a plea bargain.

The plea is recognized in United States federal criminal courts, and many state criminal courts. In many jurisdictions, a plea of &#x27; is not a typical [[right]] and carries various restrictions on its use.&#x27; originated from the Latin phrase for &quot;I do not wish to contend&quot; (, ).

==United States==
In the United States, state law determines whether, and under what circumstances, a defendant may plead no contest in state criminal cases. In federal court, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure only allow a &quot;&quot; plea to be entered with the court&#x27;s consent; before accepting the plea, the court is required to &quot;consider the parties&#x27; views and the public interest in the effective administration of justice&quot;.

===Residual effects===
A &#x27; plea has the same &quot;immediate&quot; effects as a plea of guilty, but may have different &quot;residual&quot; effects or consequences in future actions. For instance, a conviction arising from a &#x27; plea is subject to any and all penalties, fines, and forfeitures of a conviction from a guilty plea in the same case, and can be considered as an aggravating factor in future criminal actions. However, unlike a guilty plea, a defendant in a &#x27; plea may not be required to allocute the charges. This means that a &#x27; conviction typically may not be used to establish either negligence &quot;per se&quot;, malice, or whether the acts were committed at all in later civil proceedings related to the same set of facts as the criminal prosecution.

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, and in those states whose rules of evidence are similar or identical to them, &quot;&quot; pleas may not be used to defeat the hearsay prohibition if offered as an &quot;admission by [a] party-opponent&quot;. Assuming the appropriate gravity of the charge, and all other things being equal, a guilty plea to the same charge would cause the reverse effect: An opponent at trial could introduce the plea, over a hearsay objection, as evidence to establish a certain fact.

===Compared with Alford plea===
&#x27; plea is similar to an Alford plea (also known as a &quot;best interest plea&quot;). An Alford plea allows a criminal defendant to formally record an admission of guilt for the charges, yet—at the same time— declare their innocence regarding those charges. Under an Alford plea, the defendant agrees to accept all the consequences of a guilty verdict—such as accepting punishment. An Alford plea bypasses the full process of a criminal trial. The primary distinction between an Alford plea and a &#x27; plea is that, in an Alford plea, the defendant pleads guilty (in a formal sense) yet in a &quot;&quot; plea, the defendant does not assert innocence or guilt. A formal admission of guilt under an Alford plea can be used against the defendant in future civil suits, whereas nolo contendere pleas cannot.

===Individual states===
====Alaska====
In Alaska, a criminal conviction based on a &quot;&quot; plea may be used against the defendant in future civil actions. The Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 2006 that a &quot;conviction based on a no contest plea will collaterally estop the criminal defendant from denying any element in a subsequent civil action against him that was necessarily established by the conviction, as long as the prior conviction was for a serious criminal offense and the defendant in fact had the opportunity for a full and fair hearing&quot;.

====California====
In California, a &#x27; plea is known as a &quot;West plea&quot; after a seminal case involving plea bargains, &quot;People v. West&quot; (1970) 3 Cal.3d 595. The state Board of Pharmacy considers a plea of &#x27; to be deemed a conviction with regard to issuing licenses for pharmacies, pharmacists and drug wholesalers.

A &quot;nolo contendere&quot; plea to any felony is considered exactly equivalent to a guilty plea for the purposes of civil actions; this plea to any non-felony is not admissible to a civil action.

====Florida====
In Florida, the Supreme Court held in 2005 that no-contest convictions may be treated as prior convictions for the purposes of future sentencing.

====Michigan====
In Michigan, &quot;A &quot;nolo contendere&quot; plea does not admit guilt, it merely communicates to the court that the criminal defendant does not wish to contest the state&#x27;s accusations and will acquiesce in the imposition of punishment.&quot; A &quot;nolo contendere&quot; plea may be appropriate &quot;where the defendant would not be able to supply a sufficient factual basis for a guilty plea because he or she was intoxicated on the night of the incident, where there is the possibility of future civil litigation resulting from the offense, or where a defendant cannot remember the events which led to his or her being charged with a crime&quot;.

A no contest plea prevents the court from eliciting a defendant&#x27;s admission of guilt, but the result of the defendant&#x27;s plea not to contest the charges against him or her is the same as if the defendant had admitted guilt. If a defendant pleads no contest to a charged offense, with the exception of questioning the defendant about his or her role in the charged offense, the court must proceed in the same manner as if the defendant had pleaded guilty. A plea of no contest to a felony offense requires the court&#x27;s consent.

A defendant&#x27;s no contest plea to criminal charges does not &quot;estop&quot; that defendant from denying responsibility in a later civil action arising from the same conduct.

====South Carolina====
According to South Carolina code, the defendant in any misdemeanor case in any of the courts may enter a plea of &quot;nolo contendere&quot; with the consent of the court. The plea of guilty will be recorded on defendant records and will not affect sentencing.

====Texas====
In Texas, the right to appeal the results of a plea bargain taken from a plea of either &#x27; or &quot;guilty&quot; is highly restricted. Defendants who have entered a plea of &#x27; may only appeal the judgment of the court if the appeal is based on written pretrial motions ruled upon by the court.

====Virginia====
The Virginia Rules of Evidence differ from the parallel federal rules in that a &quot; plea entered in a criminal case is admissible in a related civil proceeding.

==Commonwealth==
In the Commonwealth countries—such as England and Wales, Scotland, Canada, and Australia—the plea of &quot; is not permitted. The defendant must enter a plea of &quot;guilty&quot; or &quot;not guilty&quot;. If a defendant refuses to enter a plea, the court will record a plea of &quot;not guilty&quot;.

<doc id="21748" wikidata="Q6235" url="?curid=21748" title="Nationalism">
<text>Nationalism is an idea or movement that holds that the nation should be congruent with the state. As a movement, it presupposes the existence and tends to promote the interests of a particular nation, especially with the aim of gaining and maintaining its sovereignty (self-governance) over its perceived homeland to create a nation-state. It holds that each nation should govern itself, free from outside interference (self-determination), that a nation is a natural and ideal basis for a polity, and that the nation is the only rightful source of political power. It further aims to build and maintain a single national identity, based on a combination of shared social characteristics such as culture, ethnicity, geographic location, language, politics (or the government), religion, traditions and belief in a shared singular history, and to promote national unity or solidarity. There are various definitions of a &quot;nation&quot;, which leads to different types of nationalism. The two main divergent forms are ethnic nationalism and civic nationalism.

Beginning in the late 18th century, particularly with the French Revolution and the spread of the principle of popular sovereignty or self determination, the idea that &quot;the people&quot; should rule is developed by political theorists. Three main theories have been used to explain the emergence of nationalism:
#Primordialism developed alongside nationalism during the Romantic era and held that there have always been nations. This view has since been rejected by most scholars, who view nations as socially constructed and historically contingent. Perennialism, a softer version of primordialism which accepts that nations are modern phenomena but with long historical roots, is subject to academic debate.
#Modernization theory, currently the most commonly accepted theory of nationalism, adopts a constructivist approach and proposes that nationalism emerged due to processes of modernization, such as industrialization, urbanization, and mass education, which made national consciousness possible. Proponents of this theory describe nations as &quot;imagined communities&quot; and nationalism as an &quot;invented tradition&quot; in which shared sentiment provides a form of collective identity and binds individuals together in political solidarity. 
#Ethnosymbolism explains nationalism as a product of symbols, myths, and traditions, and is associated with the work of Anthony D. Smith. 

The moral value of nationalism, the relationship between nationalism and patriotism, and the compatibility of nationalism and cosmopolitanism are all subjects of philosophical debate. Nationalism can be combined with diverse political goals and ideologies such as conservatism (national conservatism and right-wing populism) or socialism (left-wing nationalism). In practice, nationalism is seen as positive or negative depending on its ideology and outcomes. Nationalism has been a feature of movements for freedom and justice, has been associated with cultural revivals, and encourages pride in national achievements. It has also been used to legitimize racial, ethnic, and religious divisions, suppress or attack minorities, undermine human rights and democratic traditions, and start wars, being frequently cited as a cause of both world wars.

== Terminology ==
The terminological use of &quot;nations&quot;, &quot;sovereignty&quot; and associated concepts were significantly refined with the writing by Hugo Grotius of &quot;De jure belli ac pacis&quot; in the early 17th century. Living in the times of the Eighty Years&#x27; War between Spain and the Netherlands and the Thirty Years&#x27; War between Catholic and Protestant European nations, Grotius was deeply concerned with matters of conflicts between nations in the context of oppositions stemming from religious differences. The word &quot;nation&quot; was also applied before 1800 in Europe in reference to the inhabitants of a country as well as to collective identities that could include shared history, law, language, political rights, religion and traditions, in a sense more akin to the modern conception.

&quot;Nationalism&quot; as derived from the noun designating &#x27;nations&#x27; is a newer word; in the English language, dating to around 1798. The term gained wider prominence in the 19th century. The term increasingly became negative in its connotations after 1914. Glenda Sluga notes that &quot;The twentieth century, a time of profound disillusionment with nationalism, was also the great age of globalism.&quot;

Academics define nationalism as a political principle that holds that the nation and state should be congruent. According to Lisa Weeden, nationalist ideology presumes that &quot;the people&quot; and the state are congruent.

== History ==

===Intellectual origins===
Anthony D. Smith describes how intellectuals played a primary role in generating cultural perceptions of nationalism and providing the ideology of political nationalism:

Smith posits the challenges posed to traditional religion and society in the Age of Revolution propelled many intellectuals to &quot;discover alternative principles and concepts, and a new mythology and symbolism, to legitimate and ground human thought and action&quot;. He discusses the simultaneous concept of &#x27;historicism&#x27; to describe an emerging belief in the birth, growth, and decay of specific peoples and cultures, which became &quot;increasingly attractive as a framework for inquiry into the past and present and [...] an explanatory principle in elucidating the meaning of events, past and present&quot;.

The Prussian scholar Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) originated the term in 1772 in his &quot;Treatise on the Origin of Language&quot; stressing the role of a common language. He attached exceptional importance to the concepts of nationality and of patriotism &quot;he that has lost his patriotic spirit has lost himself and the whole world about himself&quot;, whilst teaching that &quot;in a certain sense every human perfection is national&quot;. Erica Benner identifies Herder as the first philosopher to explicitly suggest &quot;that identities based on language should be regarded as the primary source of legitimate political authority or locus of political resistance&quot;. Herder also encouraged the creation of a common cultural and language policy amongst the separate German states.

===Dating the emergence of nationalism===
Scholars frequently place the beginning of nationalism in the late 18th century or early 19th century with the American Declaration of Independence or with the French Revolution, though there is ongoing debate about its existence in varying forms during the Middle Ages and even antiquity. 

The consensus is that nationalism as a concept was firmly established by the 19th century. In histories of nationalism, the French Revolution (1789) is seen as an important starting point, not only for its impact on French nationalism but even more for its impact on Germans and Italians and on European intellectuals. The template of nationalism, as a method for mobilizing public opinion around a new state based on popular sovereignty, went back further than 1789: philosophers such as Rousseau and Voltaire, whose ideas influenced the French Revolution, had themselves been influenced or encouraged by the example of earlier constitutionalist liberation movements, notably the Corsican Republic (1755–1768) and American Revolution (1775–1783).

Due to the Industrial Revolution, there was an emergence of an integrated, nation-encompassing economy and a national public sphere, where British people began to mobilize on a state-wide scale, rather than just in the smaller units of their province, town or family. The early emergence of a popular patriotic nationalism took place in the mid-18th century and was actively promoted by the British government and by the writers and intellectuals of the time. National symbols, anthems, myths, flags and narratives were assiduously constructed by nationalists and widely adopted. The Union Jack was adopted in 1801 as the national one. Thomas Arne composed the patriotic song &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; in 1740, and the cartoonist John Arbuthnot invented the character of John Bull as the personification of the English national spirit in 1712.

The political convulsions of the late 18th century associated with the American and French revolutions massively augmented the widespread appeal of patriotic nationalism. Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s rise to power further established nationalism when he invaded much of Europe. Napoleon used this opportunity to spread revolutionary ideas, resulting in much of the 19th-century European Nationalism.

Some scholars argue that variants of nationalism emerged prior to the 18th century. American philosopher and historian Hans Kohn wrote in 1944 that nationalism emerged in the 17th century. In &quot;&quot;, Linda Colley explores how the role of nationalism emerged in about 1700 and developed in Britain reaching full form in the 1830s. Writing shortly after World War I, the popular British author H. G. Wells traced the origin of European nationalism to the aftermath of the Reformation, when it filled the moral void left by the decline of Christian faith:[A]s the idea of Christianity as a world brotherhood of men sank into discredit because of its fatal entanglement with priestcraft and the Papacy on the one hand and with the authority of princes on the other, and the age of faith passed into our present age of doubt and disbelief, men shifted the reference of their lives from the kingdom of God and the brotherhood of mankind to these apparently more living realities, France and England, Holy Russia, Spain, Prussia... **** In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the general population of Europe was religious and only vaguely patriotic; by the nineteenth it had become wholly patriotic.

=== 19th century ===
The political development of nationalism and the push for popular sovereignty culminated with the ethnic/national revolutions of Europe. During the 19th century nationalism became one of the most significant political and social forces in history; it is typically listed among the top causes of World War I.

Napoleon&#x27;s conquests of the German and Italian states around 1800–1806 played a major role in stimulating nationalism and the demands for national unity.

English historian J. P. T. Bury argues:
Between 1830 and 1870 nationalism had thus made great strides. It inspired great literature, quickened scholarship, and nurtured heroes. It had shown its power both to unify and to divide. It had led to great achievements of political construction and consolidation in Germany and Italy; but it was more clear than ever a threat to the Ottoman and Habsburg empires, which were essentially multi-national. European culture had been enriched by the new vernacular contributions of little-known or forgotten peoples, but at the same time such unity as it had was imperiled by fragmentation. Moreover, the antagonisms fostered by nationalism had made not only for wars, insurrections, and local hatreds—they had accentuated or created new spiritual divisions in a nominally Christian Europe.

==== France ====

Nationalism in France gained early expressions in France&#x27;s revolutionary government. In 1793, that government declared a mass conscription (&quot;levée en masse&quot;) with a call to service:
Henceforth, until the enemies have been driven from the territory of the Republic, all the French are in permanent requisition for army service. The young men shall go to battle; the married men shall forge arms in the hospitals; the children shall turn old linen to lint; the old men shall repair to the public places, to stimulate the courage of the warriors and preach the unity of the Republic and the hatred of kings.

This nationalism gained pace after the French Revolution came to a close. Defeat in war, with a loss in territory, was a powerful force in nationalism. In France, revenge and return of Alsace-Lorraine was a powerful motivating force for a quarter century after their defeat by Germany in 1871. After 1895, French nationalists focused on Dreyfus and internal subversion, and the Alsace issue petered out.

The French reaction was a famous case of &quot;Revanchism&quot; (&quot;revenge&quot;) which demands the return of lost territory that &quot;belongs&quot; to the national homeland. Revanchism draws its strength from patriotic and retributionist thought and it is often motivated by economic or geo-political factors. Extreme revanchist ideologues often represent a hawkish stance, suggesting that their desired objectives can be achieved through the positive outcome of another war. It is linked with irredentism, the conception that a part of the cultural and ethnic nation remains &quot;unredeemed&quot; outside the borders of its appropriate nation state. Revanchist politics often rely on the identification of a nation with a nation state, often mobilizing deep-rooted sentiments of ethnic nationalism, claiming territories outside the state where members of the ethnic group live, while using heavy-handed nationalism to mobilize support for these aims. Revanchist justifications are often presented as based on ancient or even autochthonous occupation of a territory since &quot;time immemorial&quot;, an assertion that is usually inextricably involved in revanchism and irredentism, justifying them in the eyes of their proponents.

The Dreyfus Affair in France 1894–1906 made the battle against treason and disloyalty a central theme for conservative Catholic French nationalists. Dreyfus, a Jew, was an outsider, that is in the views of intense nationalists, not a true Frenchman, not one to be trusted, not one to be given the benefit of the doubt. True loyalty to the nation, from the conservative viewpoint, was threatened by liberal and republican principles of liberty and equality that were leading the country to disaster.

==== Russia ====
Before 1815, the sense of Russian nationalism was weak—what sense there was focused on loyalty and obedience to the tsar. The Russian motto &quot;Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality&quot; was coined by Count Sergey Uvarov and it was adopted by Emperor Nicholas I as the official ideology of the Russian Empire. Three components of Uvarov&#x27;s triad were:
* OrthodoxyOrthodox Christianity and protection of the Russian Orthodox Church.
* Autocracyunconditional loyalty to the House of Romanov in return for paternalist protection for all social estates.
* Nationality (&quot;Narodnost&quot;, has been also translated as &quot;national spirit&quot;)recognition of the state-founding role on Russian nationality.

By the 1860s, as a result of educational indoctrination, and due to conservative resistance to ideas and ideologies which were transmitted from Western Europe, a pan-Slavic movement had emerged and it produced both a sense of Russian nationalism and a nationalistic mission to support and protect pan-Slavism. This Slavophile movement became popular in 19th-century Russia. Pan-Slavism was fueled by, and it was also the fuel for Russia&#x27;s numerous wars against the Ottoman Empire which were waged in order to achieve the alleged goal of liberating Orthodox nationalities, such as Bulgarians, Romanians, Serbs and Greeks, from Ottoman rule. Slavophiles opposed the Western European influences which had been transmitted to Russia and they were also determined to protect Russian culture and traditions. Aleksey Khomyakov, Ivan Kireyevsky, and Konstantin Aksakov are credited with co-founding the movement.

==== Latin America ====
An upsurge in nationalism in Latin America in the 1810s and 1820s sparked revolutions that cost Spain nearly all of its colonies which were located there. Spain was at war with Britain from 1798 to 1808, and the British Royal Navy cut off its contacts with its colonies, so nationalism flourished and trade with Spain was suspended. The colonies set up temporary governments or juntas which were effectively independent from Spain. These juntas were established as a result of Napoleon&#x27;s resistance failure in Spain. They served to determine new leadership and, in colonies like Caracas, abolished the slave trade as well as the Indian tribute. The division exploded between Spaniards who were born in Spain (called &quot;peninsulares&quot;) versus those of Spanish descent born in New Spain (called &quot;criollos&quot; in Spanish or &quot;creoles&quot; in English). The two groups wrestled for power, with the criollos leading the call for independence. Spain tried to use its armies to fight back but had no help from European powers. Indeed, Britain and the United States worked against Spain, enforcing the Monroe Doctrine. Spain lost all of its American colonies, except Cuba and Puerto Rico, in a complex series of revolts from 1808 to 1826.

==== Germany ====
In the German states west of Prussia, Napoleon abolished many of the old or medieval relics, such as dissolving the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. He imposed rational legal systems and demonstrated how dramatic changes were possible. His organization of the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806 promoted a feeling of nationalism.

Nationalists sought to encompass masculinity in their quest for strength and unity. It was Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck who achieved German unification through a series of highly successful short wars against Denmark, Austria and France which thrilled the pan-German nationalists in the smaller German states. They fought in his wars and eagerly joined the new German Empire, which Bismarck ran as a force for balance and peace in Europe after 1871.

In the 19th century, German nationalism was promoted by Hegelian-oriented academic historians who saw Prussia as the true carrier of the German spirit, and the power of the state as the ultimate goal of nationalism. The three main historians were Johann Gustav Droysen (1808–1884), Heinrich von Sybel (1817–1895) and Heinrich von Treitschke (1834–1896). Droysen moved from liberalism to an intense nationalism that celebrated Prussian Protestantism, efficiency, progress, and reform, in striking contrast to Austrian Catholicism, impotency and backwardness. He idealized the Hohenzollern kings of Prussia. His large-scale &quot;History of Prussian Politics&quot; (14 vol 1855–1886) was foundational for nationalistic students and scholars. Von Sybel founded and edited the leading academic history journal, &quot;Historische Zeitschrift&quot; and as the director of the Prussian state archives published massive compilations that were devoured by scholars of nationalism.

The most influential of the German nationalist historians, was Treitschke who had an enormous influence on elite students at Heidelberg and Berlin universities. Treitschke vehemently attacked parliamentarianism, socialism, pacifism, the English, the French, the Jews, and the internationalists. The core of his message was the need for a strong, unified state—a unified Germany under Prussian supervision. &quot;It is the highest duty of the State to increase its power,&quot; he stated. Although he was a descendant of a Czech family, he considered himself not Slavic but German: &quot;I am 1000 times more the patriot than a professor.&quot;
German nationalism, expressed through the ideology of Nazism, may also be understood as trans-national in nature. This aspect was primarily advocated by Adolf Hitler, who later became the leader of the Nazi Party. This party was devoted to what they identified as an Aryan race, residing in various European countries, but sometime mixed with alien elements such as Jews.

Meanwhile, the Nazis rejected many of the well-established citizens within those same countries, such as the Romani and Jews, whom they did not identify as Aryan. A key Nazi doctrine was (living space), which was a vast undertaking to transplant Aryans throughout Poland, much of Eastern Europe and the Baltic nations, and all of western Russia and Ukraine. was thus a vast project for advancing the Aryan race far outside of any particular nation or national borders. Nazi goals were focused on advancing the Aryan race as they perceived it, the modification of the human race via eugenics, and the eradication of human beings that they deemed inferior. But their goals were trans-national and intended to spread across as much of the world as they could achieve. Although Nazism glorified German history, it also embraced the supposed virtues and achievements of the Aryan race in other countries, including India. The Nazis&#x27; Aryanism longed for now-extinct species of superior bulls once used as livestock by Aryans and other features of Aryan history that never resided within the borders of Germany as a nation.

==== Italy ====
Italian nationalism emerged in the 19th century and was the driving force for Italian unification or the &quot;Risorgimento&quot; (meaning the &quot;Resurgence&quot; or &quot;Revival&quot;). It was the political and intellectual movement that consolidated the different states of the Italian peninsula into the single state of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. The memory of the &quot;Risorgimento&quot; is central to Italian nationalism but it was based in the liberal middle classes and ultimately proved a bit weak. The new government treated the newly annexed South as a kind of underdeveloped province due to its &quot;backward&quot; and poverty-stricken society, its poor grasp of standard Italian (as Italo-Dalmatian dialects of Neapolitan and Sicilian were prevalent in the common use) and its local traditions. The liberals had always been strong opponents of the pope and the very well organized Catholic Church. The liberal government under the Sicilian Francesco Crispi sought to enlarge his political base by emulating Otto von Bismarck and firing up Italian nationalism with an aggressive foreign policy. It partially crashed and his cause was set back. Of his nationalistic foreign policy, historian R. J. B. Bosworth says:
[Crispi] pursued policies whose openly aggressive character would not be equaled until the days of the Fascist regime. Crispi increased military expenditure, talked cheerfully of a European conflagration, and alarmed his German or British friends with these suggestions of preventative attacks on his enemies. His policies were ruinous, both for Italy&#x27;s trade with France, and, more humiliatingly, for colonial ambitions in East Africa. Crispi&#x27;s lust for territory there was thwarted when on 1 March 1896, the armies of Ethiopian Emperor Menelik routed Italian forces at Adowa [...] in what has been defined as an unparalleled disaster for a modern army. Crispi, whose private life and personal finances [...] were objects of perennial scandal, went into dishonorable retirement.

Italy joined the Allies in the First World War after getting promises of territory, but its war effort was not honored after the war and this fact discredited liberalism paving the way for Benito Mussolini and a political doctrine of his own creation, Fascism. Mussolini&#x27;s 20-year dictatorship involved a highly aggressive nationalism that led to a series of wars with the creation of the Italian Empire, an alliance with Hitler&#x27;s Germany, and humiliation and hardship in the Second World War. After 1945, the Catholics returned to government and tensions eased somewhat, but the former two Sicilies remained poor and partially underdeveloped (by industrial country standards). In the 1950s and early 1960s, Italy had an economic boom that pushed its economy to the fifth place in the world.

The working class in those decades voted mostly for the Communist Party, and it looked to Moscow rather than Rome for inspiration and was kept out of the national government even as it controlled some industrial cities across the North. In the 21st century, the Communists have become marginal but political tensions remained high as shown by Umberto Bossi&#x27;s Padanism in the 1980s (whose party Lega Nord has come to partially embrace a moderate version of Italian nationalism over the years) and other separatist movements spread across the country.

==== Spain ====
After the War of the Spanish Succession, rooted in the political position of the Count-Duke of Olivares and the absolutism of Philip V, the assimilation of the Crown of Aragon by the Castilian Crown through the Decrees of Nova planta was the first step in the creation of the Spanish nation-state. As in other contemporary European states, political union was the first step in the creation of the Spanish nation-state, in this case not on a uniform ethnic basis, but through the imposition of the political and cultural characteristics of the dominant ethnic group, in this case the Castilians, over those of other ethnic groups, who became national minorities to be assimilated. In fact, since the political unification of 1714, Spanish assimilation policies towards Catalan-speaking territories (Catalonia, Valencia, the Balearic Islands, part of Aragon) and other national minorities, as Basques and Galicians, have been a historical constant.

The nationalization process accelerated in the 19th century, in parallel to the origin of Spanish nationalism, the social, political and ideological movement that tried to shape a Spanish national identity based on the Castilian model, in conflict with the other historical nations of the State. Politicians of the time were aware that despite the aggressive policies pursued up to that time, the uniform and monocultural &quot;Spanish nation&quot; did not exist, as indicated in 1835 by Antonio Alcalà Galiano, when in the Cortes del Estatuto Real he defended the effort:&quot;To make the Spanish nation a nation that neither is nor has been until now.&quot;Building the nation (as in France, it was the state that created the nation, and not the opposite process) is an ideal that the Spanish elites constantly reiterated, and, one hundred years later than Alcalá Galiano, for example, we can also find it in the mouth of the fascist José Pemartín, who admired the German and Italian modeling policies:&quot;There is an intimate and decisive dualism, both in Italian fascism and in German National Socialism. On the one hand, the Hegelian doctrine of the absolutism of the state is felt. The State originates in the Nation, educates and shapes the mentality of the individual; is, in Mussolini&#x27;s words, the soul of the soul.&quot;And will be found again two hundred years later, from the socialist Josep Borrell:&quot;The modern history of Spain is an unfortunate history that meant that we did not consolidate a modern State. Independentists think that the nation makes the State. I think the opposite. The State makes the nation. A strong State, which imposes its language, culture, education.&quot;The creation of the tradition of the political community of Spaniards as common destiny over other communities has been argued to trace back to the Cortes of Cádiz. From 1812 on, revisiting the previous history of Spain, Spanish liberalism tended to take for granted the national conscience and the Spanish nation.

A by-product of 19th-century Spanish nationalist thinking is the concept of &quot;Reconquista&quot;, which holds the power of propelling the weaponized notion of Spain being a nation shaped against Islam. The strong interface of nationalism with colonialism is another feature of 19th-century nation building in Spain, with the defence of slavery and colonialism in Cuba being often able to reconcile tensions between mainland elites of Catalonia and Madrid throughout the period.

During the first half of 20th century (notably during the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera and the dictatorship of Franco), a new brand of Spanish nationalism with a marked military flavour and an authoritarian stance (as well as promoting policies favouring the Spanish language against the other languages in the country) as a means of modernizing the country was developed by Spanish conservatives, fusing regenerationist principles with traditional Spanish nationalism. The authoritarian national ideal resumed during the Francoist dictatorship, in the form of National-Catholicism, which was in turn complemented by the myth of Hispanidad. 

A distinct manifestation of Spanish nationalism in modern Spanish politics is the interchange of attacks with competing regional nationalisms. Initially present after the end of Francoism in a rather diffuse and reactive form, the Spanish nationalist discourse has been often self-branded as &quot;constitutional patriotism&quot; since the 1980s. Often ignored as in the case of other State nationalisms, its alleged &quot;non-existence&quot; has been a commonplace espoused by prominent figures in the public sphere as well as the mass-media in the country.

==== Greece ====
During the early 19th century, inspired by romanticism, classicism, former movements of Greek nationalism and failed Greek revolts against the Ottoman Empire (such as the Orlofika revolt in southern Greece in 1770, and the Epirus-Macedonian revolt of Northern Greece in 1575), Greek nationalism led to the Greek war of independence. The Greek drive for independence from the Ottoman Empire in the 1820s and 1830s inspired supporters across Christian Europe, especially in Britain, which was the result of western idealization of Classical Greece and romanticism. France, Russia and Britain critically intervened to ensure the success of this nationalist endeavor.

==== Serbia ====
For centuries the Orthodox Christian Serbs were ruled by the Muslim Ottoman Empire. The success of the Serbian Revolution against Ottoman rule in 1817 marked the birth of the Principality of Serbia. It achieved &quot;de facto&quot; independence in 1867 and finally gained international recognition in 1878. Serbia had sought to liberate and unite with Bosnia and Herzegovina to the west and Old Serbia (Kosovo and Vardar Macedonia) to the south. Nationalist circles in both Serbia and Croatia (part of Austria-Hungary) began to advocate for a greater South Slavic union in the 1860s, claiming Bosnia as their common land based on shared language and tradition. In 1914, Serb revolutionaries in Bosnia assassinated Archduke Ferdinand. Austria-Hungary, with German backing, tried to crush Serbia in 1914, thus igniting the First World War in which Austria-Hungary dissolved into nation states.

In 1918, the region of Banat, Bačka and Baranja came under control of the Serbian army, later the Great National Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci and other Slavs voted to join Serbia; the Kingdom of Serbia joined the union with State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs on 1 December 1918, and the country was named Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. It was renamed Yugoslavia in 1929, and a Yugoslav identity was promoted, which ultimately failed. After the Second World War, Yugoslav Communists established a new socialist republic of Yugoslavia. That state broke up again in the 1990s.

==== Poland ====

The cause of Polish nationalism was repeatedly frustrated before 1918. In the 1790s, the Habsburg monarchy, Prussia and Russia
invaded, annexed, and subsequently partitioned Poland. Napoleon set up the Duchy of Warsaw, a new Polish state that ignited a spirit of nationalism. Russia took it over in 1815 as Congress Poland with the tsar proclaimed as &quot;King of Poland&quot;. Large-scale nationalist revolts erupted in 1830 and 1863–64 but were harshly crushed by Russia, which tried to make the Polish language, culture and religion more like Russia&#x27;s. The collapse of the Russian Empire in the First World War enabled the major powers to re-establish an independent Poland, which survived until 1939. Meanwhile, Poles in areas controlled by Germany moved into heavy industry but their religion came under attack by Bismarck in the Kulturkampf of the 1870s. The Poles joined German Catholics in a well-organized new Centre Party, and defeated Bismarck politically. He responded by stopping the harassment and cooperating with the Centre Party.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, many Polish nationalist leaders endorsed the Piast Concept. It held there was a Polish utopia during the Piast Dynasty a thousand years before, and modern Polish nationalists should restore its central values of Poland for the Poles. Jan Poplawski had developed the &quot;Piast Concept&quot; in the 1890s, and it formed the centerpiece of Polish nationalist ideology, especially as presented by the National Democracy Party, known as the &quot;Endecja,&quot; which was led by Roman Dmowski. In contrast with the Jagiellon concept, there was no concept for a multi-ethnic Poland.
The Piast concept stood in opposition to the &quot;Jagiellon Concept,&quot; which allowed for multi-ethnicism and Polish rule over numerous minority groups such as those in the Kresy. The Jagiellon Concept was the official policy of the government in the 1920s and 1930s. Soviet dictator Josef Stalin at Tehran in 1943 rejected the Jagiellon Concept because it involved Polish rule over Ukrainians and Belarusians. He instead endorsed the Piast Concept, which justified a massive shift of Poland&#x27;s frontiers to the west. After 1945 the Soviet-back puppet communist regime wholeheartedly adopted the Piast Concept, making it the centerpiece of their claim to be the &quot;true inheritors of Polish nationalism&quot;. After all the killings, including Nazi German occupation, terror in Poland and population transfers during and after the war, the nation was officially declared as 99% ethnically Polish.

In current Polish politics, Polish nationalism is most openly represented by parties linked in the Liberty and Independence Confederation coalition. As of 2020 the Confederation, composed of several smaller parties, had 11 deputies (under 7%) in the Sejm.

====Bulgaria====

Bulgarian modern nationalism emerged under Ottoman rule in the late 18th and early 19th century, under the influence of western ideas such as liberalism and nationalism, which trickled into the country after the French Revolution.

The Bulgarian national revival started with the work of Saint Paisius of Hilendar, who opposed Greek domination of Bulgaria&#x27;s culture and religion. His work &quot;Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya&quot; (&quot;History of the Slav-Bulgarians&quot;), which appeared in 1762, was the first work of Bulgarian historiography. It is considered Paisius&#x27; greatest work and one of the greatest pieces of Bulgarian literature. In it, Paisius interpreted Bulgarian medieval history with the goal of reviving the spirit of his nation.

His successor was Saint Sophronius of Vratsa, who started the struggle for an independent Bulgarian church. An autonomous Bulgarian Exarchate was established in 1870/1872 for the Bulgarian diocese wherein at least two-thirds of Orthodox Christians were willing to join it.

In 1869 the Internal Revolutionary Organization was initiated.

The April Uprising of 1876 indirectly resulted in the re-establishment of Bulgaria in 1878.

==== Jewish Nationalism ====
Jewish nationalism arose in the latter half of the 19th century, largely as a response to the rise of nation-states. Traditionally Jews lived under uncertain and oppressive conditions. In western Europe, Jews not subject to such restrictions since emancipation of early 19th century often assimilated into the dominant culture. Both assimilation and the traditional second-class status of Jews were considered as threats to the Jewish identity by Jewish nationalists. The method of combatting these threats were different among different national movements among Jews.

Zionism, ultimately the most successful of Jewish nationalist movements, advocated in the creation of a Jewish state in the Land of Israel. Labour Zionism hoped that the new Jewish state would be based on socialist principles. They imagined a new Jew that, in contrast to the Jews of the diaspora, was strong, worked the land, and spoke Hebrew. Religious Zionism instead had various religious reasonings for returning to Israel. Although according to historian David Engel, Zionism was more about fear that Jews would end up dispersed and unprotected, rather than fulfilling old prophecies of historical texts. The efforts of the Zionist movement culminated in the establishment of the State of Israel.

Jewish Territorialism split from the Zionist Movement in 1903, arguing for a Jewish state no matter where. As more Jews moved to Palestine, the main territorialist organization lost support, eventually disbanding in the 1925. Smaller territorialist movements lasted until the establishment of the State of Israel.

Jewish Autonomism and Bundism instead advocated for Jewish national autonomy within the territory they already lived in. Most manifestations of this movement were left-wing in nature, and actively anti-Zionist. While successful among Eastern European Jews in the early 20th century, it lost most of its support due to the Holocaust, although some support lasted through the 20th century.

=== 20th century ===
==== China ====

The awakening of nationalism across Asia helped shape the history of the continent. The key episode was the decisive defeat of Russia by Japan in 1905, demonstrating the military advancement of non-Europeans in a modern war. The defeat quickly led to manifestations of a new interest in nationalism in China, as well as Turkey and Persia. In China Sun Yat-sen (1866–1925) launched his new party the Kuomintang (National People&#x27;s Party) in defiance of the decrepit Empire, which was run by outsiders. The Kuomintang recruits pledged:
[F]rom this moment I will destroy the old and build the new, and fight for the self-determination of the people, and will apply all my strength to the support of the Chinese Republic and the realization of democracy through the Three Principles, ... for the progress of good government, the happiness and perpetual peace of the people, and for the strengthening of the foundations of the state in the name of peace throughout the world.

The Kuomintang largely ran China until the Communists took over in 1949. But the latter had also been strongly influenced by Sun&#x27;s nationalism as well as by the May Fourth Movement in 1919. It was a nationwide protest movement about the domestic backwardness of China and has often been depicted as the intellectual foundation for Chinese Communism. The New Culture Movement stimulated by the May Fourth Movement waxed strong throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Historian Patricia Ebrey says:
Nationalism, patriotism, progress, science, democracy, and freedom were the goals; imperialism, feudalism, warlordism, autocracy, patriarchy, and blind adherence to tradition were the enemies. Intellectuals struggled with how to be strong and modern and yet Chinese, how to preserve China as a political entity in the world of competing nations.

==== Greece ====

Nationalist irredentist movements Greek advocating for Enosis (unity of ethnically Greek states with the Hellenic Republic to create a unified Greek state), used today in the case of Cyprus, as well as the Megali Idea, the Greek movement that advocated for the reconquering of Greek ancestral lands from the Ottoman Empire (such as Crete, Ionia, Pontus, Northern Epirus, Cappadocia, Thrace among others) that were popular in the late 19th and early to 20th centuries, led to many Greek states and regions that were ethnically Greek to eventually unite with Greece and the Greco-Turkish war of 1919.

The 4th of August regime was a fascist or fascistic nationalist authoritarian dictatorship inspired by Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist Italy and Hitler&#x27;s Germany and led by Greek general Ioannis Metaxas from 1936 to his death in 1941. It advocated for the Third Hellenic Civilization, a culturally superior Greek civilization that would be the successor of the First and Second Greek civilizations, that were Ancient Greece and the Byzantine empire respectively. It promoted Greek traditions, folk music and dances, classicism as well as medievalism.

==== Africa ====
In the 1880s the European powers divided up almost all of Africa (only Ethiopia and Liberia were independent). They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger. In the 1950s and the 1960s, colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria, Kenya and elsewhere.

Across Africa, nationalism drew upon the organizational skills that natives had learned in the British and French, and other armies during the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers or the traditional local power structures that had been collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them. Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.

South Africa, a British colony, was exceptional in that it became virtually independent by 1931. From 1948, it was controlled by white Afrikaner nationalists, who focused on racial segregation and white minority rule, known as apartheid. It lasted until 1994, when multiracial elections were held. The international anti-apartheid movement supported black nationalists until success was achieved, and Nelson Mandela was elected president.

==== Middle East ====
Arab nationalism, a movement toward liberating and empowering the Arab peoples of the Middle East, emerged during the late 19th century, inspired by other independence movements of the 18th and 19th centuries. As the Ottoman Empire declined and the Middle East was carved up by the Great Powers of Europe, Arabs sought to establish their own independent nations ruled by Arabs, rather than foreigners. Syria was established in 1920; Transjordan (later Jordan) gradually gained independence between 1921 and 1946; Saudi Arabia was established in 1932; and Egypt achieved gradually gained independence between 1922 and 1952. The Arab League was established in 1945 to promote Arab interests and cooperation between the new Arab states.

The Zionist movement, emerged among European Jews in the 19th century. In 1882, Jews, from Europe, began to emigrate to Ottoman Palestine with the goal of establishing a new Jewish homeland. The majority and local population in Palestine, Palestinian Arabs were demanding independence from the British Mandate.

==== Breakup of Yugoslavia ====
There was a rise in extreme nationalism after the Revolutions of 1989 had triggered the collapse of communism in the 1990s. That left many people with no identity. The people under communist rule had to integrate, but they now found themselves free to choose. That made long-dormant conflicts rise and create sources of serious conflict. When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to a rise in extreme nationalism.

In his 1992 article &quot;Jihad vs. McWorld,&quot; Benjamin Barber proposed that the fall of communism would cause large numbers of people to search for unity and that small-scale wars would become common, as groups will attempt to redraw boundaries, identities, cultures and ideologies. The fall of communism also allowed for an &quot;us vs. them&quot; mentality to return. Governments would become vehicles for social interests, and the country would attempt to form national policies based on the majority culture, religion or ethnicity. Some newly sprouted democracies had large differences in policies on matters, which ranged from immigration and human rights to trade and commerce.

The academic Steven Berg felt that the root of nationalist conflicts was the demand for autonomy and a separate existence. That nationalism can give rise to strong emotions, which may lead to a group fighting to survive, especially as after the fall of communism, political boundaries did not match ethnic boundaries. Serious conflicts often arose and escalated very easily, as individuals and groups acted upon their beliefs and caused death and destruction. When that happens, states unable to contain the conflict run the risk of slowing their progress at democratization.

Yugoslavia was established after the First World War and joined three acknowledged ethnic groups: Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The national census numbers from 1971 to 1981 measured an increase from 1.3% to 5.4% in the population that ethnically identified itself as Yugoslavs. That meant that the country, almost as a whole, was divided by distinctive religious, ethnic and national loyalties after nearly 50 years.

Nationalist separatism of Croatia and Slovenia from the rest of Yugoslavia has basis in historical imperialist conquests of the region (Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Empire) and existence within separate spheres of religious, cultural and industrial influence – Catholicism, Protenstantism, Central European cultural orientation in the northwest, versus Orthodoxy, Islam and Orientalism in the southeast. Croatia and Slovenia were subsequently more economically and industrially advanced and remained as such throughout existence of both forms of Yugoslavia.

In the 1970s, the leadership of the separate territories in Yugoslavia protected only territorial interests, at the expense of other territories. In Croatia, there was almost a split within the territory between Serbs and Croats so that any political decision would kindle unrest, and tensions could cross adjacent territories: Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia had no group with a majority; Muslim, Serb, Croat, and Yugoslavs stopped leadership from advancing here as well. Political organizations were not able to deal successfully with such diverse nationalisms. Within the territories, leaderships would not compromise. To do so would create a winner in one ethnic group and a loser in another and raise the possibility of a serious conflict. That strengthened the political stance promoting ethnic identities and caused intense and divided political leadership within Yugoslavia.
In the 1980s, Yugoslavia began to break into fragments. Economic conditions within Yugoslavia were deteriorating. Conflict in the disputed territories was stimulated by the rise in mass nationalism and ethnic hostilities. The per capita income of people in the northwestern territory, encompassing Croatia and Slovenia, was several times higher than that of the southern territory. That, combined with escalating violence from ethnic Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo, intensified economic conditions. The violence greatly contributed to the rise of extreme nationalism of Serbs in Serbia and the rest of Yugoslavia. The ongoing conflict in Kosovo was propagandized by a communist Serb, Slobodan Milošević, to increase Serb nationalism further. As mentioned, that nationalism gave rise to powerful emotions which grew the force of Serbian nationalism by highly nationalist demonstrations in Vojvodina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo. Serbian nationalism was so high that Slobodan Milošević ousted leaders in Vojvodina and Montenegro, repressed Albanians within Kosovo and eventually controlled four of the eight regions/territories. Slovenia, one of the four regions not under communist control, favoured a democratic state.

In Slovenia, fear was mounting because Milošević would use the militia to suppress the country, as had occurred in Kosovo. Half of Yugoslavia wanted to be democratic, the other wanted a new nationalist authoritarian regime. In fall of 1989, tensions came to a head, and Slovenia asserted its political and economic independence from Yugoslavia and seceded. In January 1990, there was a total break with Serbia at the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, an institution that had been conceived by Milošević to strengthen unity and later became the backdrop for the fall of communism in Yugoslavia.

In August 1990, a warning to the region was issued when ethnically divided groups attempted to alter the government structure. The republic borders established by the Communist regime in the postwar period were extremely vulnerable to challenges from ethnic communities. Ethnic communities arose because they did not share the identity with everyone within the new post-communist borders, which threatened the new governments. The same disputes were erupting that were in place prior to Milošević and were compounded by actions from his regime.

Also, within the territory, the Croats and the Serbs were in direct competition for control of government. Elections were held and increased potential conflicts between Serbian and Croat nationalism. Serbia wanted to be separate and to decide its own future based on its own ethnic composition, but that would then give Kosovo encouragement to become independent from Serbia. Albanians in Kosovo were already practically independent from Kosovo, but Serbia did not want to let Kosovo become independent. Albanian nationalists wanted their own territory, but that would require a redrawing of the map and threaten neighboring territories. When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.

Nationalism again gave rise to powerful emotions, which evoked, in some extreme cases, a willingness to die for what one believed, a fight for the survival of the group. The end of communism began a long period of conflict and war for the region. For six years, 200,000–500,000 people died in the Bosnian War. All three major ethnicities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnian Muslims, Croats, Serbs) suffered at the hands of each other. The war garnered assistance from groups, Muslim, Orthodox, and Western Christian, and from state actors, which supplied all sides; Saudi Arabia and Iran supported Bosnia; Russia supported Serbia; Central European and the West, including the US, supported Croatia; and the Pope supported Slovenia and Croatia.

=== 21st century ===

The rise of globalism in the late 20th century led to a rise in nationalism and populism in Europe and North America. That trend was further fueled by increased terrorism in the West (the September 11 attacks in the United States being a prime example), increasing unrest and civil wars in the Middle East, and waves of Muslim refugees, especially from the Syrian Civil War, flooding into Europe ( the refugee crisis appears to have peaked). Nationalist groups like Germany&#x27;s Pegida, France&#x27;s National Front and the UK Independence Party gained prominence in their respective nations advocating restrictions on immigration to protect the local populations.

Since 2010, Catalan nationalists have led a renewed Catalan independence movement and declared Catalan independence. The movement has been opposed by Spanish nationalists. In the 2010s, the Greek economic crisis and waves of immigration have led to a significant rise of Fascism and Greek nationalism across Greece, especially among the youth.

In Russia, exploitation of nationalist sentiments allowed Vladimir Putin to consolidate power. This nationalist sentiment was used in Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and other actions in Ukraine. Nationalist movements gradually began to rise in Central Europe as well, particularly Poland, under the influence of the ruling party, Law and Justice (led by Jarosław Kaczyński). In Hungary, the anti-immigration rhetoric and stance against foreign influence is a powerful national glue promoted the ruling Fidesz party (led by Viktor Orbán). Nationalist parties have also joined governing coalitions in Bulgaria, Slovakia, Latvia and Ukraine.

In India, Hindu nationalism has grown in popularity with the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party, a right-wing party which has been ruling India at the national level since 2014. The rise in religious nationalism comes with the rise of right-wing populism in India, with the election and re-election of populist leader Narendra Modi as Prime Minister, who promised economic prosperity for all and an end to corruption. Militant Buddhist nationalism is also on the rise in Myanmar, Thailand and Sri Lanka.

In Japan, nationalist influences in the government developed over the course of the early 21st century, largely from the far right ultra-conservative Nippon Kaigi organization. The new movement has advocated re-establishing Japan as a military power and pushed revisionist historical narratives denying events such as the Nanking Massacre.

A referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom was held on 18 September 2014. The proposal was defeated, with 55.3% voting against independence. In a 2016 referendum, the British populace unexpectedly voted to withdraw the United Kingdom from the European Union (known as &quot;Brexit&quot;). As the promise of continued European Union membership was a core feature of the anti-independence campaign during the Scottish referendum, there have been calls for a second referendum on Scottish independence.
The 2016 United States presidential campaign saw the unprecedented rise of Donald Trump, a businessman with no political experience who ran on a populist/nationalist platform and struggled to gain endorsements from mainstream political figures, even within his own party. Trump&#x27;s slogans &quot;&quot;Make America Great Again&quot; and &quot;America First&quot;&quot; exemplified his campaign&#x27;s repudiation of globalism and its staunchly nationalistic outlook. His unexpected victory in the election was seen as part of the same trend that had brought about the Brexit vote. On 22 October 2018, two weeks before the mid-term elections President Trump openly proclaimed that he was a nationalist to a cheering crowd at a rally in Texas in support of re-electing Senator Ted Cruz who was once an adversary. On 29 October 2018 Trump equated nationalism to patriotism, saying &quot;I&#x27;m proud of this country and I call that &quot;nationalism.&quot;

In 2016, Rodrigo Duterte became president of the Philippines running a distinctly nationalist campaign. Contrary to the policies of his recent predecessors, he distanced the country from the Philippines&#x27; former ruler, the United States, and sought closer ties with China (as well as Russia).

In 2017, Turkish nationalism propelled President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to gain unprecedented power in a national referendum. Reactions from world leaders were mixed, with Western European leaders generally expressing concern while the leaders of many of the more authoritarian regimes as well as President Trump offered their congratulations.

== Political science ==
Many political scientists have theorized about the foundations of the modern nation-state and the concept of sovereignty. The concept of nationalism in political science draws from these theoretical foundations. Philosophers like Machiavelli, Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau conceptualized the state as the result of a &quot;social contract&quot; between rulers and individuals. Max Weber provides the most commonly used definition of the state, &quot;that human community which successfully lays claim to the monopoly of legitimate physical violence within a certain territory&quot;. According to Benedict Anderson, nations are &quot;Imagined Communities&quot;, or socially constructed institutions.

Many scholars have noted the relationship between state-building, war, and nationalism. John Etherington argues nationalism is inherently exclusionary and thus potentially violent, while Jeffrey Herbst posits that external threats can foster nationalist sentiment: &quot;External threats have such a powerful effect on nationalism because people realize in a profound manner that they are under threat because of who they are as a nation; they are forced to recognize that it is only as a nation that they can successfully defeat the threat&quot;. With increased external threats, the state&#x27;s extractive capacities increase. He links the lack of external threats to countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, post-independence, to weak state nationalism and state capacity. Barry Posen argues that nationalism increases the intensity of war, and that states deliberately promote nationalism with the aim of improving their military capabilities. Most new nation-states since 1815 have emerged through decolonization.

Adria Lawrence has argued that nationalism in the colonial world was spurred by failures of colonial powers to extend equal political rights to the subjects in the colonies, thus prompting them to pursue independence. Michael Hechter has argued similarly that &quot;peripheral nationalisms&quot; formed when empires prevented peripheral regions from having autonomy and local rule.

== Sociology ==
The sociological or modernist interpretation of nationalism and nation-building argues that nationalism arises and flourishes in modern societies that have an industrial economy capable of self-sustainability, a central supreme authority capable of maintaining authority and unity, and a centralized language understood by a community of people. Modernist theorists note that this is only possible in modern societies, while traditional societies typically lack the prerequisites for nationalism. They lack a modern self-sustainable economy, have divided authorities, and use multiple languages resulting in many groups being unable to communicate with each other.

Prominent theorists who developed the modernist interpretation of nations and nationalism include: Carlton J. H. Hayes, Henry Maine, Ferdinand Tönnies, Rabindranath Tagore, Émile Durkheim, Max Weber, Arnold Joseph Toynbee and Talcott Parsons.

In his analysis of the historical changes and development of human societies, Henry Maine noted that the key distinction between traditional societies defined as &quot;status&quot; societies based on family association and functionally diffuse roles for individuals and modern societies defined as &quot;contract&quot; societies where social relations are determined by rational contracts pursued by individuals to advance their interests. Maine saw the development of societies as moving away from traditional status societies to modern contract societies.

In his book &quot;Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft&quot; (1887), Ferdinand Tönnies defined a &quot;Gemeinschaft&quot; (&quot;community&quot;) as being based on emotional attachments as attributed with traditional societies while defining a &quot;Gesellschaft&quot; (&quot;society&quot;) as an impersonal society that is modern. Although he recognized the advantages of modern societies, he also criticized them for their cold and impersonal nature that caused alienation while praising the intimacy of traditional communities.

Émile Durkheim expanded upon Tönnies&#x27; recognition of alienation and defined the differences between traditional and modern societies as being between societies based upon &quot;mechanical solidarity&quot; versus societies based on &quot;organic solidarity&quot;. Durkheim identified mechanical solidarity as involving custom, habit, and repression that was necessary to maintain shared views. Durkheim identified organic solidarity-based societies as modern societies where there exists a division of labour based on social differentiation that causes alienation. Durkheim claimed that social integration in traditional society required authoritarian culture involving acceptance of a social order. Durkheim claimed that modern society bases integration on the mutual benefits of the division of labour, but noted that the impersonal character of modern urban life caused alienation and feelings of anomie.

Max Weber claimed the change that developed modern society and nations is the result of the rise of a charismatic leader to power in a society who creates a new tradition or a rational-legal system that establishes the supreme authority of the state. Weber&#x27;s conception of charismatic authority has been noted as the basis of many nationalist governments.

=== Primordialist evolutionary interpretation ===
The primordialist perspective is based upon evolutionary theory. This approach has been popular with the general public but is typically rejected by experts. Laland and Brown report that &quot;the vast majority of professional academics in the social sciences not only ... ignore evolutionary methods but in many cases [are] extremely hostile to the arguments&quot; that draw vast generalizations from rather limited evidence.

The evolutionary theory of nationalism perceives nationalism to be the result of the evolution of human beings into identifying with groups, such as ethnic groups, or other groups that form the foundation of a nation. Roger Masters in &quot;The Nature of Politics&quot; describes the primordial explanation of the origin of ethnic and national groups as recognizing group attachments that are thought to be unique, emotional, intense, and durable because they are based upon kinship and promoted along lines of common ancestry.

The primordialist evolutionary views of nationalism often reference the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin as well as Social Darwinist views of the late nineteenth century. Thinkers like Herbert Spencer and Walter Bagehot reinterpreted Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection &quot;often in ways inconsistent with Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution&quot; by making unsupported claims of biological difference among groups, ethnicities, races, and nations. Modern evolutionary sciences have distanced themselves from such views, but notions of long-term evolutionary change remain foundational to the work of evolutionary psychologists like John Tooby and Leda Cosmides.

Approached through the primordialist perspective, the example of seeing the mobilization of a foreign military force on the nation&#x27;s borders may provoke members of a national group to unify and mobilize themselves in response. There are proximate environments where individuals identify nonimmediate real or imagined situations in combination with immediate situations that make individuals confront a common situation of both subjective and objective components that affect their decisions. As such proximate environments cause people to make decisions based on existing situations and anticipated situations.
Critics argue that primordial models relying on evolutionary psychology are based not on historical evidence but on assumptions of unobserved changes over thousands of years and assume stable genetic composition of the population living in a specific area and are incapable of handling the contingencies that characterize every known historical process. Robert Hislope argues:
[T]he articulation of cultural evolutionary theory represents theoretical progress over sociobiology, but its explanatory payoff remains limited due to the role of contingency in human affairs and the significance of non-evolutionary, proximate causal factors. While evolutionary theory undoubtedly elucidates the development of all organic life, it would seem to operate best at macro-levels of analysis, &quot;distal&quot; points of explanation, and from the perspective of the long-term. Hence, it is bound to display shortcomings at micro-level events that are highly contingent in nature.

In 1920, English historian G. P. Gooch argued that &quot;[while patriotism is as old as human association and has gradually widened its sphere from the clan and the tribe to the city and the state, nationalism as an operative principle and an articulate creed only made its appearance among the more complicated intellectual processes of the modern world.&quot;

=== Marxist interpretations ===
In &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels declared that &quot;the working men have no country&quot;. Vladimir Lenin supported the concept of self-determination. Joseph Stalin&#x27;s &quot;Marxism and the National Question&quot; (1913) declares that &quot;a nation is not a racial or tribal, but a historically constituted community of people;&quot; &quot;a nation is not a casual or ephemeral , but a stable community of people&quot;; &quot;a nation is formed only as a result of lengthy and systematic intercourse, as a result of people living together generation after generation&quot;; and, in its entirety: &quot;a nation is a historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, and psychological make-up manifested in a common culture.&quot;

== Types ==

Historians, sociologists and anthropologists have debated different types of nationalism since at least the 1930s. Generally, the most common way of classifying nationalism has been to describe movements as having either &quot;civic&quot; or &quot;ethnic&quot; nationalist characteristics. This distinction was popularized in the 1950s by Hans Kohn who described &quot;civic&quot; nationalism as &quot;Western&quot; and more democratic while depicting &quot;ethnic&quot; nationalism as &quot;Eastern&quot; and undemocratic. Since the 1980s, scholars of nationalism have pointed out numerous flaws in this rigid division and proposed more specific classifications and numerous varieties.

=== Anti-colonial ===

Anti-colonial nationalism is an intellectual framework that preceded, accompanied and followed the process of decolonization in the mid-1900s. Benedict Anderson defined a nation as a socially constructed community that is co-created by individuals who imagine themselves as part of this group. He points to the New World as the site that originally conceived of nationalism as a concept, which is defined by its imagination of an ahistorical identity that negates colonialism by definition. This concept of nationalism was exemplified by the transformation of settler colonies into nations, while anti-colonial nationalism is exemplified by movements against colonial powers in the 1900s.

Nationalist mobilization in French colonial Africa and British colonial India developed &quot;when colonial regimes refused to cede rights to their increasingly well-educated colonial subjects&quot;, who formed indigenous elites and strategically adopted and adapted nationalist tactics. New national identities may cross pre-existing ethnic or linguistic divisions. Anti-colonial independence movements in Africa and Asia in the 1900s were led by individuals who had a set of shared identities and imagined a homeland without external rule. Anderson argues that the racism often experienced as a result of colonial rule and attributed to nationalism is rather due to theories of class.

Gellner&#x27;s theory of nationalism argues that nationalism works for combining one culture or ethnicity in one state, which leads to that state&#x27;s success. For Gellner, nationalism is ethnic, and state political parties should reflect the ethnic majority in the state. This definition of nationalism also contributes to anti-colonial nationalism, if one conceives of anti-colonial movements to be movements consisting of one specific ethnic group against an outside ruling party. Edward Said also saw nationalism as ethnic, at least in part, and argued that nationalist narratives often go hand in hand with racism, as communities define themselves in relation to the other.

Anti-colonial nationalism is not static and is defined by different forms of nationalism depending on location. In the anti-colonial movement that took place in the Indian subcontinent, Mahatma Gandhi and his allies in the Indian independence movement argued for a composite nationalism, not believing that an independent Indian nation should be defined by its religious identity. Despite large-scale opposition by the Indian National Congress supporters, the insistence of the Muslims under the separatist Muslim League resulted in the Indian subcontinent being partitioned into two states in 1947 along religious lines into the Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan and the Hindu-majority Dominion of India.

Because of colonialism&#x27;s creation of state and country lines across ethnic, religious, linguistic and other historical boundaries, anti-colonial nationalism is largely related to land first. After independence, especially in countries with particularly diverse populations with historic enmity, there have been a series of smaller independence movements that are also defined by anti-colonialism.

Philosopher and scholar Achille Mbembe argues that post-colonialism is a contradictory term, because colonialism is ever present. Those that participate in this intellectual practice envision a post-colonialism despite its being the defining frame for the world. This is the case with anti-colonialism as well. Anti-colonial nationalism as an intellectual framework persisted into the late 20th century with the resistance movements in Soviet satellite states and continues with independence movements in the Arab world in the 21st century.

=== Civic and liberal ===

Civic nationalism defines the nation as an association of people who identify themselves as belonging to the nation, who have equal and shared political rights, and allegiance to similar political procedures. According to the principles of civic nationalism, the nation is not based on common ethnic ancestry, but is a political entity whose core identity is not ethnicity. This civic concept of nationalism is exemplified by Ernest Renan in his lecture in 1882 &quot;What is a Nation?&quot;, where he defined the nation as a &quot;daily referendum&quot; (frequently translated &quot;daily plebiscite&quot;) dependent on the will of its people to continue living together.

Civic nationalism is normally associated with liberal nationalism, although the two are distinct, and did not always coincide. On the one hand, until the late 19th and early 20th century adherents to anti-Enlightenment movements such as French Legitimism or Spanish Carlism often rejected the liberal, national unitary state, yet identified themselves not with an ethnic nation but with a non-national dynasty and regional feudal privileges. Xenophobic movements in long-established Western European states indeed often took a &#x27;civic national&#x27; form, rejecting a given group&#x27;s ability to assimilate with the nation due to its belonging to a cross-border community (Irish Catholics in Britain, Ashkenazic Jews in France). On the other hand, while subnational separatist movements were commonly associated with ethnic nationalism, this was not always so, and such nationalists as the Corsican Republic, United Irishmen, Breton Federalist League or Catalan Republican Party could combine a rejection of the unitary civic-national state with a belief in liberal universalism.

Liberal nationalism is commonly considered to be compatible with liberal values of freedom, tolerance, equality, and individual rights. Ernest Renan and John Stuart Mill are often thought to be early liberal nationalists. Liberal nationalists often defend the value of national identity by saying that individuals need a national identity to lead meaningful, autonomous lives, and that liberal democratic polities need national identity to function properly.

Civic nationalism lies within the traditions of rationalism and liberalism, but as a form of nationalism it is usually contrasted with ethnic nationalism. Civic nationalism is correlated with long-established states whose dynastic rulers had gradually acquired multiple distinct territories, with little change to boundaries, but which contained historical populations of multiple linguistic and/or confessional backgrounds. Since individuals living within different parts of the state territory might have little obvious common ground, civic nationalism developed as a way for rulers to both explain a contemporary reason for such heterogeneity and to provide a common purpose (Ernest Renan&#x27;s classic description in What is a Nation? (1882) as a voluntary partnership for a common endeavor). Renan argued that factors such as ethnicity, language, religion, economics, geography, ruling dynasty and historic military deeds were important but not sufficient. Needed was a spiritual soul that allowed as a &quot;daily referendum&quot; among the people. Civic-national ideals influenced the development of representative democracy in multiethnic countries such as the United States and France, as well as in constitutional monarchies such as Great Britain, Belgium and Spain.

=== Creole ===

Creole nationalism is the ideology that emerged in independence movements among the creoles (descendants of the colonizers), especially in Latin America in the early 19th century. It was facilitated when French Emperor Napoleon seized control of Spain and Portugal, breaking the chain of control from the Spanish and Portuguese kings to the local governors. Allegiance to the Napoleonic states was rejected, and increasingly the creoles demanded independence. They achieved it after civil wars 1808–1826.

=== Ethnic === 

Ethnic nationalism, also known as ethno-nationalism, is a form of nationalism wherein the &quot;nation&quot; is defined in terms of ethnicity. The central theme of ethnic nationalists is that &quot;nations are defined by a shared heritage, which usually includes a common language, a common faith, and a common ethnic ancestry&quot;. It also includes ideas of a culture shared between members of the group, and with their ancestors. It is different from a purely cultural definition of &quot;the nation,&quot; which allows people to become members of a nation by cultural assimilation; and from a purely linguistic definition, according to which &quot;the nation&quot; consists of all speakers of a specific language.

Whereas nationalism in and of itself does not imply a belief in the superiority of one ethnicity or country over others, some nationalists support ethnocentric supremacy or protectionism.

The humiliation of being a second-class citizen led regional minorities in multiethnic states, such as Great Britain, Spain, France, Germany, Russia and the Ottoman Empire, to define nationalism in terms of loyalty to their minority culture, especially language and religion. Forced assimilation was anathema.

For the politically dominant cultural group, assimilation was necessary to minimize disloyalty and treason and therefore became a major component of nationalism. A second factor for the politically dominant group was competition with neighboring states—nationalism involved a rivalry, especially in terms of military prowess and economic strength.

=== Economic ===

Economic nationalism, or economic patriotism, is an ideology that favors state interventionism in the economy, with policies that emphasize domestic control of the economy, labor, and capital formation, even if this requires the imposition of tariffs and other restrictions on the movement of labor, goods and capital.

=== Gendered and muscular ===

Feminist critique interprets nationalism as a mechanism through which sexual control and repression are justified and legitimized, often by a dominant masculine power. The gendering of nationalism through socially constructed notions of masculinity and femininity not only shapes what masculine and feminine participation in the building of that nation will look like, but also how the nation will be imagined by nationalists. A nation having its own identity is viewed as necessary, and often inevitable, and these identities are gendered. The physical land itself is often gendered as female (i.e. &quot;Motherland&quot;), with a body in constant danger of violation by foreign males, while national pride and protectiveness of &quot;her&quot; borders is gendered as masculine.
History, political ideologies, and religions place most nations along a continuum of muscular nationalism. Muscular nationalism conceptualizes a nation&#x27;s identity as being derived from muscular or masculine attributes that are unique to a particular country. If definitions of nationalism and gender are understood as socially and culturally constructed, the two may be constructed in conjunction by invoking an &quot;us&quot; versus &quot;them&quot; dichotomy for the purpose of the exclusion of the so-called &quot;other,&quot; who is used to reinforce the unifying ties of the nation. The empowerment of one gender, nation or sexuality tends to occur at the expense and disempowerment of another; in this way, nationalism can be used as an instrument to perpetuate heteronormative structures of power. The gendered manner in which dominant nationalism has been imagined in most states in the world has had important implications on not only individual&#x27;s lived experience, but on international relations. Colonialism has historically been heavily intertwined with muscular nationalism, from research linking hegemonic masculinity and empire-building, to intersectional oppression being justified by colonialist images of the &quot;other&quot;, a practice integral in the formation of Western identity. This &quot;othering&quot; may come in the form of orientalism, whereby the East is feminized and sexualized by the West. The imagined feminine East, or &quot;other,&quot; exists in contrast to the masculine West.

The status of conquered nations can become a causality dilemma: the nation was &quot;conquered because they were effeminate and seen as effeminate because they were conquered.&quot; In defeat they are considered militaristically unskilled, not aggressive, and thus not muscular. In order for a nation to be considered &quot;proper&quot;, it must possess the male-gendered characteristics of virility, as opposed to the stereotypically female characteristics of subservience and dependency. Muscular nationalism is often inseparable from the concept of a warrior, which shares ideological commonalities across many nations; they are defined by the masculine notions of aggression, willingness to engage in war, decisiveness, and muscular strength, as opposed to the feminine notions of peacefulness, weakness, non-violence, and compassion. This masculinized image of a warrior has been theorized to be &quot;the culmination of a series of gendered historical and social processes&quot; played out in a national and international context. Ideas of cultural dualism—of a martial man and chaste woman—which are implicit in muscular nationalism, underline the raced, classed, gendered, and heteronormative nature of dominant national identity.

Nations and gender systems are mutually supportive constructions: the nation fulfils the masculine ideals of comradeship and brotherhood. Masculinity has been cited as a notable factor in producing political militancy. A common feature of national crisis is a drastic shift in the socially acceptable ways of being a man, which then helps to shape the gendered perception of the nation as a whole.

=== Integral, pan and irredentism ===

There are different types of nationalism including Risorgimento nationalism and Integral nationalism. Whereas risorgimento nationalism applies to a nation seeking to establish a liberal state (for example the Risorgimento in Italy and similar movements in Greece, Germany, Poland during the 19th century or the civic American nationalism), integral nationalism results after a nation has achieved independence and has established a state. Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, according to Alter and Brown, were examples of integral nationalism.

Some of the qualities that characterize integral nationalism are anti-individualism, statism, radical extremism, and aggressive-expansionist militarism. The term Integral Nationalism often overlaps with fascism, although many natural points of disagreement exist. Integral nationalism arises in countries where a strong military ethos has become entrenched through the independence struggle, when, once independence is achieved, it is believed that a strong military is required to ensure the security and viability of the new state. Also, the success of such a liberation struggle results in feelings of national superiority that may lead to extreme nationalism.

Pan-nationalism is unique in that it covers a large area span. Pan-nationalism focuses more on &quot;clusters&quot; of ethnic groups. Pan-Slavism is one example of Pan-nationalism. The goal is to unite all Slavic people into one country. They did succeed by uniting several south Slavic people into Yugoslavia in 1918.

=== Left-wing ===
Left-wing nationalism, occasionally known as socialist nationalism, not to be confused with the German fascist &quot;National Socialism&quot;, is a political movement that combines left-wing politics with nationalism.

Many nationalist movements are dedicated to national liberation, in the view that their nations are being persecuted by other nations and thus need to exercise self-determination by liberating themselves from the accused persecutors. Anti-revisionist Marxism–Leninism is closely tied with this ideology, and practical examples include Stalin&#x27;s early work &quot;Marxism and the National Question&quot; and his socialism in one country edict, which declares that nationalism can be used in an internationalist context, fighting for national liberation without racial or religious divisions.

Other examples of left-wing nationalism include Fidel Castro&#x27;s 26th of July Movement that launched the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Cornwall&#x27;s Mebyon Kernow, Ireland&#x27;s Sinn Féin, Wales&#x27;s Plaid Cymru, Galicia&#x27;s Galician Nationalist Bloc, the Awami League in Bangladesh, the African National Congress in South Africa and numerous movements in Eastern Europe.

=== National-anarchism ===

Among the first advocates of national-anarchism were Hans Cany, Peter Töpfer and former National Front activist Troy Southgate, founder of the National Revolutionary Faction, a since disbanded British-based organization which cultivated links to certain far-left and far-right circles in the United Kingdom and in post-Soviet states, not to be confused with the national-anarchism of the Black Ram Group. In the United Kingdom, national-anarchists worked with &quot;Albion Awake&quot;, &quot;Alternative Green&quot; (published by former &quot;Green Anarchist&quot; editor Richard Hunt) and Jonathan Boulter to develop the Anarchist Heretics Fair. Those national-anarchists cite their influences primarily from Mikhail Bakunin, William Godwin, Peter Kropotkin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Max Stirner and Leo Tolstoy.

A position developed in Europe during the 1990s, national-anarchist groups have seen arisen worldwide, most prominently in Australia (New Right Australia/New Zealand), Germany (International National Anarchism) and the United States (BANA). National-anarchism has been described as a radical right-wing nationalist ideology which advocates racial separatism and white racial purity. National-anarchists claim to syncretize neotribal ethnic nationalism with philosophical anarchism, mainly in their support for a stateless society whilst rejecting anarchist social philosophy. The main ideological innovation of national-anarchism is its anti-state palingenetic ultranationalism. National-anarchists advocate homogeneous communities in place of the nation state. National-anarchists claim that those of different ethnic or racial groups would be free to develop separately in their own tribal communes while striving to be politically meritocratic, economically non-capitalist, ecologically sustainable and socially and culturally traditional.

Although the term &quot;national-anarchism&quot; dates back as far as the 1920s, the contemporary national-anarchist movement has been put forward since the late 1990s by British political activist Troy Southgate, who positions it as being &quot;beyond left and right&quot;. The few scholars who have studied national-anarchism conclude that it represents a further evolution in the thinking of the radical right rather than an entirely new dimension on the political spectrum. National-anarchism is considered by anarchists as being a rebranding of totalitarian fascism and an oxymoron due to the inherent contradiction of anarchist philosophy of anti-fascism, abolition of unjustified hierarchy, dismantling of national borders and universal equality between different nationalities as being incompatible with the idea of a synthesis between anarchism and fascism.

National-anarchism has elicited scepticism and outright hostility from both left-wing and far-right critics. Critics, including scholars, accuse national-anarchists of being nothing more than white nationalists who promote a communitarian and racialist form of ethnic and racial separatism while wanting the militant chic of calling themselves &quot;anarchists&quot; without the historical and philosophical baggage that accompanies such a claim, including the anti-racist egalitarian anarchist philosophy and the contributions of Jewish anarchists. Some scholars are sceptical that implementing national-anarchism would result in an expansion of freedom and describe it as an authoritarian anti-statism that would result in authoritarianism and oppression, only on a smaller scale.

=== Nativist ===

Nativist nationalism is a type of nationalism similar to creole or territorial types of nationalism, but which defines belonging to a nation solely by being born on its territory. In countries where strong nativist nationalism exists, people who were not born in the country are seen as lesser nationals than those who were born there and are called &quot;immigrants&quot; even if they became naturalized. It is cultural as people will never see a foreign-born person as one of them and is legal as such people are banned for life from holding certain jobs, especially government jobs. In scholarly studies, &quot;nativism&quot; is a standard technical term, although those who hold this political view do not typically accept the label. . . . do not consider themselves nativists. For them it is a negative term and they rather consider themselves as &#x27;Patriots&#x27;.&quot;

=== Racial ===

Racial nationalism is an ideology that advocates a racial definition of national identity. Racial nationalism seeks to preserve a given race through policies such as banning race mixing and the immigration of other races. Its ideas tend to be in direct conflict with those of anti-racism and multiculturalism. Specific examples are black nationalism and white nationalism.

=== Religious ===

Religious nationalism is the relationship of nationalism to a particular religious belief, dogma, or affiliation where a shared religion can be seen to contribute to a sense of national unity, a common bond among the citizens of the nation. Saudi Arabian, Iranian, Egyptian, Iraqi, American and the Pakistani-Islamic nationalism (Two-Nation Theory) are some examples.

=== Territorial ===
Some nationalists exclude certain groups. Some nationalists, defining the national community in ethnic, linguistic, cultural, historic, or religious terms (or a combination of these), may then seek to deem certain minorities as not truly being a part of the &#x27;national community&#x27; as they define it. Sometimes a mythic homeland is more important for the national identity than the actual territory occupied by the nation.

Territorial nationalists assume that all inhabitants of a particular nation owe allegiance to their country of birth or adoption. A sacred quality is sought in the nation and in the popular memories it evokes. Citizenship is idealized by territorial nationalists. A criterion of a territorial nationalism is the establishment of a mass, public culture based on common values, codes and traditions of the population.

=== Sport ===

Sport spectacles like football&#x27;s World Cup command worldwide audiences as nations battle for supremacy and the fans invest intense support for their national team. Increasingly people have tied their loyalties and even their cultural identity to national teams. The globalization of audiences through television and other media has generated revenues from advertisers and subscribers in the billions of dollars, as the FIFA Scandals of 2015 revealed. Jeff Kingston looks at football, the Commonwealth Games, baseball, cricket, and the Olympics and finds that, &quot;The capacity of sports to ignite and amplify nationalist passions and prejudices is as extraordinary as is their power to console, unify, uplift and generate goodwill.&quot; The phenomenon is evident across most of the world. The British Empire strongly emphasized sports among its soldiers and agents across the world, and often the locals joined in enthusiastically. It established a high prestige competition in 1930, named the British Empire Games from 1930 to 1950, the British Empire and Commonwealth Games from 1954 to 1966, British Commonwealth Games from 1970 to 1974 and since then the Commonwealth Games.

The French Empire was not far behind the British in the use of sports to strengthen colonial solidarity with France. Colonial officials promoted and subsidized gymnastics, table games, and dance and helped football spread to French colonies.

== Criticism ==

Critics of nationalism have argued that it is often unclear what constitutes a nation, or whether a nation is a legitimate unit of political rule. Nationalists hold that the boundaries of a nation and a state should coincide with one another, thus nationalism tends to oppose multiculturalism It can also lead to conflict when more than one national group finds itself claiming rights to a particular territory or seeking to take control of the state.

Philosopher A. C. Grayling describes nations as artificial constructs, &quot;their boundaries drawn in the blood of past wars&quot;. He argues that &quot;there is no country on earth which is not home to more than one different but usually coexisting culture. Cultural heritage is not the same thing as national identity&quot;.

Nationalism is considered by its critics to be inherently divisive, as adherents may draw upon and highlight perceived differences between people, emphasizing an individual&#x27;s identification with their own nation. They also consider the idea to be potentially oppressive, because it can submerge individual identity within a national whole and give elites or political leaders potential opportunities to manipulate or control the masses. Much of the early opposition to nationalism was related to its geopolitical ideal of a separate state for every nation. The classic nationalist movements of the 19th century rejected the very existence of the multi-ethnic empires in Europe, contrary to an ideological critique of nationalism which developed into several forms of internationalism and anti-nationalism. The Islamic revival of the 20th century also produced an Islamist critique of the nation-state. (see Pan-Islamism)

At the end of the 19th century, Marxists and other socialists and communists (such as Rosa Luxemburg) produced political analyses that were critical of the nationalist movements then active in Central and Eastern Europe, although a variety of other contemporary socialists and communists, from Vladimir Lenin (a communist) to Józef Piłsudski (a socialist), were more sympathetic to national self-determination.

In his classic essay on the topic, George Orwell distinguishes nationalism from patriotism (which he defines as devotion to a particular place). More abstractly, nationalism is &quot;power-hunger tempered by self-deception&quot;. For Orwell, the nationalist is more likely than not dominated by irrational negative impulses:
A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist—that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating—but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of great power units and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the upgrade and some hated rival is on the downgrade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him.

In the liberal political tradition, there was mostly a negative attitude toward nationalism as a dangerous force and a cause of conflict and war between nation-states. The historian Lord Acton put the case for &quot;nationalism as insanity&quot; in 1862. He argued that nationalism suppresses minorities, places country above moral principles and creates a dangerous individual attachment to the state. He opposed democracy and tried to defend the pope from Italian nationalism. Since the late 20th century, liberals have been increasingly divided, with some philosophers such as Michael Walzer, Isaiah Berlin, Charles Taylor and David Miller emphasizing that a liberal society needs to be based in a stable nation state.

The pacifist critique of nationalism also concentrates on the violence of some nationalist movements, the associated militarism, and on conflicts between nations inspired by jingoism or chauvinism. National symbols and patriotic assertiveness are in some countries discredited by their historical link with past wars, especially in Germany. British pacifist Bertrand Russell criticized nationalism for diminishing the individual&#x27;s capacity to judge his or her fatherland&#x27;s foreign policy. Albert Einstein stated that &quot;Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind&quot;. Jiddu Krishnamurti stated that &quot;Nationalism is merely the glorification of tribalism&quot;.

Transhumanists have also expressed their opposition to nationalism, to the extent that some transhumanists believe national identities should be dissolved entirely. The influential transhumanist FM-2030 refused to identify with any nationality, referring to himself as &#x27;universal&#x27;. Furthermore, in &quot;The Transhumanist Handbook&quot;, Kate Levchuk stated that a transhumanist &quot;doesn&#x27;t believe in nationality&quot;.

<text>A nation is a type of social organization where a collective identity, a national identity, has emerged from a combination of shared features across a given population, such as language, history, ethnicity, culture, territory or society. Some nations are constructed around ethnicity (see ethnic nationalism) while others are bound by political constitutions (see civic nationalism).

A nation is generally more overtly political than an ethnic group. Benedict Anderson defines a nation as &quot;an imagined political community […] imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion&quot;, while Anthony D. Smith defines nations as cultural-political communities that have become conscious of their autonomy, unity and particular interests.

The consensus among scholars is that nations are socially constructed, historically contingent, organizationally flexible, and a distinctly modern phenomenon. Throughout history, people have had an attachment to their kin group and traditions, territorial authorities and their homeland, but nationalism – the belief that state and nation should align as a nation state – did not become a prominent ideology until the end of the 18th century.

== Etymology and terminology ==
The English word &quot;nation&quot; from Middle English c. 1300, &quot;nacioun&quot; &quot;a race of people, large group of people with common ancestry and language,&quot; from Old French &quot;nacion&quot; &quot;birth (&quot;naissance&quot;), rank; descendants, relatives; country, homeland&quot; (12c.) and directly from Latin &quot;nationem&quot; (nominative &quot;(nātĭō), supine of verb nascar « to birth » (supine : natum)&quot;) &quot;birth, origin; breed, stock, kind, species; race of people, tribe,&quot; literally &quot;that which has been born,&quot; from &quot;natus&quot;, past participle of &quot;nasci&quot; &quot;be born&quot; (Old Latin &quot;gnasci&quot;), from PIE root *gene- &quot;give birth, beget,&quot; with derivatives referring to procreation and familial and tribal groups.

In Latin, &quot;natio&quot; represents the children of the same birth and also a human group of same origin. By Cicero, &quot;natio&quot; is used for &quot;people&quot;.

&quot;Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary&quot; defines a nation as follows:
nation, &quot;n.&quot; (14c) 1. A large group of people having a common origin, language, tradition, and usage constitutes a political entity. • When a nation is coincident with a state, the term &quot;nation-state&quot; is often used...
2. A community of people inhabiting a defined territory and organized under an independent government; a sovereign political state...

The word &quot;nation&quot; is sometimes used as synonym for:
* State (polity) or sovereign state: a government that controls a specific territory, which may or may not be associated with any particular ethnic group
* Country: a geographic territory, which may or may not have an affiliation with a government or ethnic group
* Ethnic group in older texts due to its original meaning and etymology

Thus the phrase &quot;nations of the world&quot; could be referring to the top-level governments (as in the name for the United Nations), various large geographical territories, or various large ethnic groups of the planet.

Depending on the meaning of &quot;nation&quot; used, the term &quot;nation state&quot; could be used to distinguish larger states from small city states, or could be used to distinguish multinational states from those with a single ethnic group.

== Nations in History ==
=== The existence of earlier nations ===

The broad consensus amongst scholars of nationalism is that nations are a recent phenomenon. However, some historians argue that their existence can be traced to the medieval period, or a minority believe even to antiquity.

Adrian Hastings argued that nations and nationalism are predominantly Christian phenomena, with Jews being the sole exception. He viewed them as the &quot;true proto-nation&quot; that provided the original model of nationhood through the foundational example of ancient Israel in the Hebrew Bible, despite losing their political sovereignty for nearly two millennia. The Jews, however, maintained a cohesive national identity throughout this period, which ultimately culminated in the emergence of Zionism and the establishment of modern lsrael. Anthony D. Smith wrote that the Jews of the late Second Temple period provide &quot;a closer approximation to the ideal type of the nation ... perhaps anywhere else in the ancient world.&quot;

Susan Reynolds has argued that many European medieval kingdoms were nations in the modern sense, except that political participation in nationalism was available only to a limited prosperous and literate class, while Hastings claims England&#x27;s Anglo-Saxon kings mobilized mass nationalism in their struggle to repel Norse invasions. He argues that Alfred the Great, in particular, drew on biblical language in his law code and that during his reign selected books of the Bible were translated into Old English to inspire Englishmen to fight to turn back the Norse invaders. Hastings argues for a strong renewal of English nationalism (following a hiatus after the Norman conquest) beginning with the translation of the complete bible into English by the Wycliffe circle in the 1380s, positing that the frequency and consistency in usage of the word nation from the early fourteenth century onward strongly suggest English nationalism and the English nation have been continuous since that time.

However, John Breuilly criticizes Hastings&#x27;s assumption that continued usage of a term such as &#x27;English&#x27; means continuity in its meaning. Patrick J. Geary agrees, arguing names were adapted to different circumstances by different powers and could convince people of continuity, even if radical discontinuity was the lived reality.

Florin Curta cites Medieval Bulgarian nation as another possible example. Danubian Bulgaria was founded in 680-681 as a continuation of Great Bulgaria. After the adoption of Orthodox Christianity in 864 it became one of the cultural centres of Slavic Europe. Its leading cultural position was consolidated with the invention of the Cyrillic script in its capital Preslav on the eve of the 10th century. Hugh Poulton argues the development of Old Church Slavonic literacy in the country had the effect of preventing the assimilation of the South Slavs into neighboring cultures and stimulated the development of a distinct ethnic identity. A symbiosis was carried out between the numerically weak Bulgars and the numerous Slavic tribes in that broad area from the Danube to the north, to the Aegean Sea to the south, and from the Adriatic Sea to the west, to the Black Sea to the east, who accepted the common ethnonym &quot;Bulgarians&quot;. During the 10th century the Bulgarians established a form of national identity that was far from modern nationalism but helped them to survive as a distinct entity through the centuries.

Anthony Kaldellis asserts in &quot;Hellenism in Byzantium&quot; (2008) that what is called the Byzantine Empire was the Roman Empire transformed into a nation-state in the Middle Ages.

Azar Gat also argues China, Korea and Japan were nations by the time of the European Middle Ages.

=== Criticisms ===
In contrast, Geary rejects the conflation of early medieval and contemporary group identities as a myth, arguing it is a mistake to conclude continuity based on the recurrence of names. He criticizes historians for failing to recognize the differences between earlier ways of perceiving group identities and more contemporary attitudes, stating they are &quot;trapped in the very historical process we are attempting to study&quot;.

Similarly, Sami Zubaida notes that many states and empires in history ruled over ethnically diverse populations, and &quot;shared ethnicity between ruler and ruled did not always constitute grounds for favour or mutual support&quot;. He goes on to argue ethnicity was never the primary basis of identification for the members of these multinational empires.

Paul Lawrence criticises Hastings&#x27;s reading of Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; as evidence of an early English national identity, instead observing that those writing so-called &#x27;national&#x27; histories may have &quot;been working with a rather different notion of &#x27;the nation&#x27; to those writing history in the modern period&quot;. Lawrence goes on to argue that such documents do not demonstrate how ordinary people identified themselves, pointing out that, while they serve as texts in which an elite defines itself, &quot;their significance in relation to what the majority thought and felt was likely to have been minor&quot;.

=== Use of term &quot;nationes&quot; by medieval universities and other medieval institutions ===

A significant early use of the term &quot;nation&quot;, as &quot;natio&quot;, occurred at Medieval universities to describe the colleagues in a college or students, above all at the University of Paris, who were all born within a &quot;pays&quot;, spoke the same language and expected to be ruled by their own familiar law. In 1383 and 1384, while studying theology at Paris, Jean Gerson was elected twice as a procurator for the French &quot;natio&quot;. The University of Prague adopted the division of students into &quot;nationes&quot;: from its opening in 1349 the &quot;studium generale&quot; which consisted of Bohemian, Bavarian, Saxon and Polish &quot;nations&quot;.

In a similar way, the &quot;nationes&quot; were segregated by the Knights Hospitaller of Jerusalem, who maintained at Rhodes the hostels from which they took their name &quot;where foreigners eat and have their places of meeting, each nation apart from the others, and a Knight has charge of each one of these hostels, and provides for the necessities of the inmates according to their religion&quot;, as the Spanish traveller Pedro Tafur noted in 1436.

== Early modern nations ==

In his article, &quot;The Mosaic Moment: An Early Modernist Critique of the Modernist Theory of Nationalism&quot;, Philip S. Gorski argues that the first modern nation-state was the Dutch Republic, created by a fully modern political nationalism rooted in the model of biblical nationalism. In a 2013 article &quot;Biblical nationalism and the sixteenth-century states&quot;, Diana Muir Appelbaum expands Gorski&#x27;s argument to apply to a series of new, Protestant, sixteenth-century nation states. A similar, albeit broader, argument was made by Anthony D. Smith in his books, &quot;Chosen Peoples: Sacred Sources of National Identity&quot; and &quot;Myths and Memories of the Nation&quot;.

In her book &quot;Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity&quot;, Liah Greenfeld argued that nationalism was invented in England by 1600. According to Greenfeld, England was “the first nation in the world&quot;.

For Smith, creating a &#x27;world of nations&#x27; has had profound consequences for the global state system, as a nation comprises both a cultural and political identity. Therefore, he argues, &quot;any attempt to forge a national identity is also a political action with political consequences, like the need to redraw the geopolitical map or alter the composition of political regimes and states&quot;.

== Social science ==
There are three notable perspectives on how nations developed. Primordialism (perennialism), which reflects popular conceptions of nationalism but has largely fallen out of favour among academics, proposes that there have always been nations and that nationalism is a natural phenomenon. Ethnosymbolism explains nationalism as a dynamic, evolving phenomenon and stresses the importance of symbols, myths and traditions in the development of nations and nationalism. Modernization theory, which has superseded primordialism as the dominant explanation of nationalism, adopts a constructivist approach and proposes that nationalism emerged due to processes of modernization, such as industrialization, urbanization, and mass education, which made national consciousness possible.

Proponents of modernization theory describe nations as &quot;imagined communities&quot;, a term coined by Benedict Anderson. A nation is an imagined community in the sense that the material conditions exist for imagining extended and shared connections and that it is objectively impersonal, even if each individual in the nation experiences themselves as subjectively part of an embodied unity with others. For the most part, members of a nation remain strangers to each other and will likely never meet. Nationalism is consequently seen an &quot;invented tradition&quot; in which shared sentiment provides a form of collective identity and binds individuals together in political solidarity. A nation&#x27;s foundational &quot;story&quot; may be built around a combination of ethnic attributes, values and principles, and may be closely connected to narratives of belonging.

Scholars in the 19th and early 20th century offered constructivist criticisms of primordial theories about nations. A prominent lecture by Ernest Renan, &quot;What is a Nation?&quot;, argues that a nation is &quot;a daily referendum&quot;, and that nations are based as much on what the people jointly forget as on what they remember. Carl Darling Buck argued in a 1916 study, &quot;Nationality is essentially subjective, an active sentiment of unity, within a fairly extensive group, a sentiment based upon real but diverse factors, political, geographical, physical, and social, any or all of which may be present in this or that case, but no one of which must be present in all cases.&quot;

In the late 20th century, many social scientists argued that there were two types of nations, the civic nation of which French republican society was the principal example and the ethnic nation exemplified by the German peoples. The German tradition was conceptualized as originating with early 19th-century philosophers, like Johann Gottlieb Fichte, and referred to people sharing a common language, religion, culture, history, and ethnic origins, that differentiate them from people of other nations. On the other hand, the civic nation was traced to the French Revolution and ideas deriving from 18th-century French philosophers. It was understood as being centred in a willingness to &quot;live together&quot;, this producing a nation that results from an act of affirmation. This is the vision, among others, of Ernest Renan.

==Debate about a potential future of nations==

There is an ongoing debate about the future of nations − about whether this framework will persist as is and whether there are viable or developing alternatives.

The theory of the clash of civilizations lies in direct contrast to cosmopolitan theories about an ever more-connected world that no longer requires nation states. According to political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, people&#x27;s cultural and religious identities will be the primary source of conflict in the post–Cold War world.

The theory was originally formulated in a 1992 lecture at the American Enterprise Institute, which was then developed in a 1993 &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; article titled &quot;The Clash of Civilizations?&quot;, in response to Francis Fukuyama&#x27;s 1992 book, &quot;The End of History and the Last Man&quot;. Huntington later expanded his thesis in a 1996 book &quot;The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order&quot;.

Huntington began his thinking by surveying the diverse theories about the nature of global politics in the post–Cold War period. Some theorists and writers argued that human rights, liberal democracy and capitalist free market economics had become the only remaining ideological alternative for nations in the post–Cold War world. Specifically, Francis Fukuyama, in &quot;The End of History and the Last Man&quot;, argued that the world had reached a Hegelian &quot;end of history&quot;.

Huntington believed that while the age of ideology had ended, the world had reverted only to a normal state of affairs characterized by cultural conflict. In his thesis, he argued that the primary axis of conflict in the future will be along cultural and religious lines.
Postnationalism is the process or trend by which nation states and national identities lose their importance relative to supranational and global entities. Several factors contribute to the trend Huntington identifies, including economic globalization, a rise in importance of multinational corporations, the internationalization of financial markets, the transfer of socio-political power from national authorities to supranational entities, such as multinational corporations, the United Nations and the European Union and the advent of new information and culture technologies such as the Internet. However attachment to citizenship and national identities often remains important.

Jan Zielonka of the University of Oxford states that &quot;the future structure and exercise of political power will resemble the medieval model more than the Westphalian one&quot; with the latter being about &quot;concentration of power, sovereignty and clear-cut identity&quot; and neo-medievalism meaning &quot;overlapping authorities, divided sovereignty, multiple identities and governing institutions, and fuzzy borders&quot;.

<text>Sesotho sa Leboa is a Sotho-Tswana language group spoken in the northeastern provinces of South Africa, most commonly in the Mpumalanga, Gauteng and Limpopo provinces. It is also known by Pedi or Sepedi and holds the status of an official language in South Africa&quot;.&quot;

An official language for the Lebowa homeland during apartheid, it is the first language of over 4.6 million (9.1%) people according to the South African National Census of 2011, making it the 5th most spoken language in South Africa.

== Official language status ==

=== Sepedi vs Northern Sotho ===
According to Chapter 1, Section 6 of the South African Constitution, Sepedi is one of South Africa&#x27;s 12 official languages. There has been significant debate about whether Northern Sotho should be used instead of Pedi. The English version of the South African Constitution lists Sepedi as an official language, while the Sepedi or Northern Sotho version of the Constitution of South Africa lists Sesotho sa Lebowa as an official South African language.

=== South Africa&#x27;s official language policy ===
South Africa&#x27;s official language policy refers to the eleven official languages of South Africa (i.e., Sepedi, Sesotho, Setswana, siSwati, Tshivenda, Xitsonga, Afrikaans, isiNdebele, isiXhosa, isiZulu and English), as specified in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.

==Name==

The Northern Sotho written language was based largely on the Sepedi dialect. Missionaries studied this dialect the most closely and first developed the orthography in 1860 by Alexander Merensky, Grutzner, and Gerlachshoop. This subsequently provided a common writing system for 20 or more varieties of the Sotho-Tswana languages spoken in the former Transvaal, and also helped lead to &quot;Sepedi&quot; being used as the umbrella term for the entire language family. However, there are objections to this synecdoche by other Northern Sotho dialect speakers, such as speakers of Modjadji&#x27;s Lobedu dialect.

==Other varieties of Northern Sotho==

Northern Sotho can be subdivided into Highveld-Sotho, which consists of comparatively recent immigrants mostly from the west and southwest parts of South Africa, and Lowveld-Sotho, which consists of a combination of immigrants from the north of South Africa and Sotho inhabitants of longer standing. Like other Sotho-Tswana people, their languages are named after totemic animals and, sometimes, by alternating or combining these with the names of famous chiefs.

===The Highveld-Sotho===

The group consists of the following dialects:
*Bapedi 
**Bapedi Marota (in the narrower sense)
**Marota Mamone
**Marota Mohlaletsi
**Batau Bapedi (Matlebjane, Masemola, Marishane, Batau ba Manganeng - Nkadimeng, Kgaphola, Diphofa, Nchabeleng, Mogashoa, Phaahla, Sloane, Mashegoana, Mphanama)
*Phokwane
*Bakone
**Kone (Ga-Matlala)
**Dikgale
*Baphuthi
*Baroka
*Bakgaga (Mphahlele, Maake, and Mothapo)
*Chuene
*Mathabatha
*Maserumule
*Tlou (Ga-Molepo)
*Thobejane (Ga-Mafefe)
*Batlokwa 
**Batlokwa Ba Lethebe
*Makgoba
*Batlou
*Bahananwa (Ga-Mmalebogo)
*Moremi
*Motlhatlhana
*Babirwa
*Batswapong
*Mmamabolo
*Bamongatane
*Bakwena ba Moletjie (Moloto)
*Batlhaloga
*Bahwaduba, BaGaMagale, and many others

===The Lowveld-Sotho===

The group consists of Lobedu, Narene, Phalaborwa (Malatji), Mogoboya, Kone, Kgaga, Pulana, Pai, Ramafalo, Mohale and Kutswe.

==Classification==
Northern Sotho is one of the Sotho languages of the Bantu family. Although Northern Sotho shares the name &quot;Sotho&quot; with Southern Sotho, the two groups also have a great deal in common with their sister language Setswana. Northern Sotho is also closely related to Setswana, sheKgalagari and siLozi. It is a standardized variety, amalgamating several distinct varieties or dialects. Northern Sotho is also spoken by the Mohlala people.

Most Khelobedu speakers only learn to speak Sepedi at school, such that Sepedi is only their second or third language. Khelobedu is a written language. Lobedu is spoken by a majority of people in the Greater Tzaneen, Greater Letaba, and BaPhalaborwa municipalities, and a minority in Greater Giyani municipality, as well as in the Limpopo Province and Tembisa township in Gauteng. Its speakers are known as the Balobedu.

Sepulana () exists in unwritten form and forms part of the standard Northern Sotho. Sepulana is spoken in Bushbuckridge area by the MaPulana people.

== Writing system ==
Sepedi is written in the Latin alphabet. The letter &quot;š&quot; is used to represent the sound [] (&quot;sh&quot; is used in the trigraph &quot;tsh&quot; to represent an aspirated &quot;ts&quot; sound). The circumflex accent can be added to the letters e and o to distinguish their different sounds, but it is mostly used in language reference books. Some word prefixes, especially in verbs, are written separately from the stem.

== Phonology ==
===Vowels===
===Consonants===

Other consonant sounds include fricative-combinations and .

Within nasal consonant compounds, the first nasal consonant sound is recognized as syllabic. Words such as &quot;nthuše&quot; &quot;help me&quot;, are pronounced as . /n/ can also be pronounced as following a velar consonant.

Urban varieties of Northern Sotho, such as Pretoria Sotho (actually a derivative of Tswana), have acquired clicks in an ongoing process of such sounds spreading from Nguni languages.

==Vocabulary==
Some examples of Northern Sotho words and phrases:

<text>The New York Giants are a professional American football team based in the New York metropolitan area. The Giants compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) East division. The team plays its home games at MetLife Stadium (which it shares with the New York Jets) at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, west of New York City. The Giants are headquartered and practice at the Quest Diagnostics Training Center, also in the Meadowlands.

The Giants were one of five teams that joined the NFL in 1925, and they are the only one of that group still existing, as well as the league&#x27;s longest-established team in the Northeastern United States. The team ranks third among all NFL franchises with eight NFL championship titles: four in the pre–Super Bowl era (1927, 1934, 1938, 1956) and four since the advent of the Super Bowl (XXI (1986), XXV (1990), XLII (2007), and XLVI (2011)), along with more championship appearances than any other team, with 19 overall appearances. Their championship tally is surpassed only by the Green Bay Packers (13) and the Chicago Bears (9). Throughout their history, the Giants have featured 29 Hall of Fame players, including NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP) award winners Mel Hein, Frank Gifford, Y. A. Tittle, and Lawrence Taylor.

To distinguish themselves from the professional baseball team of the same name, the football team was incorporated as the &quot;New York National League Football Company, Inc.&quot; in 1929 and then changed to &quot;New York Football Giants, Inc.&quot; in 1937. While the baseball team moved to San Francisco after the 1957 season, the football team continues to legally use it as its corporate name, which the team is often referred to by fans and sportscasters alike. The team has also acquired several nicknames, including &quot;Big Blue&quot;, the &quot;G-Men&quot;, and the &quot;Jints&quot;, an intentionally mangled contraction seen frequently in the &quot;New York Post&quot; and &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, originating from the baseball team when they were based in New York. In addition, the team as a whole is occasionally referred to as the &quot;Big Blue Wrecking Crew&quot;, even though this moniker primarily and originally refers to the Giants defensive unit during the 1980s and early-1990s.

The team&#x27;s heated rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles is the oldest of the NFC East rivalries, dating back to 1933, and has been called the best rivalry in the NFL in the 21st century.

==History==
===Mara family era (1925–1990)===
On August 1, 1925, Timothy Mara and Will Gibson were granted a franchise by the NFL for their newly organized team in New York City — the New York Football Giants. Cost of the franchise was $2,500.

The Giants played their first game as an away game against All New Britain in New Britain, Connecticut, on October 4, 1925. They defeated New Britain 26–0 in front of a crowd of 10,000. The Giants were successful in their first season, finishing with an 8–4 record.

====Earl Potteiger years (1927–1928)====

=====NFL champions (1927)=====
In its third season, the team finished with the best record in the league at 11–1–1 and was awarded the NFL title. After a disappointing fourth season (1928) owner Tim Mara bought the entire squad of the Detroit Wolverines, principally to acquire star quarterback Benny Friedman, and merged the two teams under the Giants name.

In 1930, there were still many who questioned the quality of the professional game, claiming the college &quot;amateurs&quot; played with more intensity than professionals. In December 1930, the Giants played a team of Notre Dame All Stars at the Polo Grounds to raise money for the unemployed of New York City. It was also an opportunity to establish the skill and prestige of the pro game. Knute Rockne reassembled his Four Horsemen along with the stars of his 1924 Championship squad and told them to score early, then defend. Rockne, like much of the public, thought little of pro football and expected an easy win. But from the beginning it was a one-way contest, with Friedman running for two Giant touchdowns and Hap Moran passing for another. Notre Dame failed to score. When it was all over, Coach Rockne told his team, &quot;That was the greatest football machine I ever saw. I am glad none of you got hurt.&quot; The game raised $100,000 for the homeless, and is often credited with establishing the legitimacy of the professional game for those who were critical. It also was the last game the legendary Rockne ever coached; he was killed in an airplane crash on March 31, 1931.

====Steve Owen years (1931–1953)====
In a 16-year span from 1931 to 1947, the Giants qualified to play in the NFL championship game 8 times, winning twice. During this period the Giants were led by Hall of Fame coach Steve Owen, and Hall of Fame players Mel Hein, Red Badgro, and Tuffy Leemans. In 1933 the Giants faced the Chicago Bears in the championship game and were defeated 23–21.


=====NFL champions (1934)=====
The famous &quot;Sneakers Game&quot; was played in this era where the Giants defeated the Chicago Bears on an icy field in the 1934 NFL Championship Game, while wearing sneakers for better traction. The team would return to the championship game the following year but would fall to the Detroit Lions 26–7.

=====NFL champions (1938)=====
The Giants captured their third NFL championship in 1938 with a 23–17 win over the Green Bay Packers. Both teams returned to the championship game the following year in 1939, with the Packers shutting out the Giants 27–0.

The period also featured the 1944 Giants, which are ranked as the #1 defensive team in NFL history, &quot;...a truly awesome unit&quot;. They gave up only 7.5 points per game (a record that still stands) and shut out five of their 10 opponents, though they lost 14–7 to the Green Bay Packers in the 1944 NFL Championship Game. The Giants played the Detroit Lions to a scoreless tie on November 7, 1943. To this day, no NFL game played since then has ended in a scoreless tie. The Giants were particularly successful from the latter half of the 1930s until the United States entry into World War II.

====Jim Lee Howell years (1954–1960)====

=====NFL champions (1956)=====
The Giants won their next championship in 1956, the first year the team began playing at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx borough of New York City. Aided by a number of future Pro Football Hall of Fame players such as running back Frank Gifford, linebacker Sam Huff, and offensive tackle Roosevelt Brown, as well as all-pro running back Alex Webster. The Giants&#x27; 1956 championship team not only included players who would eventually find their way to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but a Hall of Fame coaching staff, as well. Head coach Jim Lee Howell&#x27;s staff had Vince Lombardi coaching the offense and Tom Landry coaching the defense. From 1958 to 1963, the Giants played in the NFL Championship Game five times, but failed to win. Most significantly, the Giants played the Colts in the 1958 NFL Championship Game, which is considered a event in the history of the NFL. The game, which the Giants lost in overtime 23–17, is often called &quot;The Greatest Game Ever Played&quot; and is considered one of the most important events in furthering the NFL&#x27;s popularity. The following year, they lost the championship to the Colts again, giving up a 9–7 fourth-quarter lead en route to a 31–16 loss.


====Allie Sherman years (1961–1968)====
Both the 1961 and 1962 championship game matched the Giants up against the Green Bay Packers, with the Giants losing both 37–0 and 16–7 respectively. In 1963, led by league MVP quarterback Y. A. Tittle, who threw a then-NFL record 36 touchdown passes, the Giants advanced to the NFL Championship Game, where they lost to the Bears 14–10 for their third consecutive championship loss, as well as their fifth loss in the title game in 6 years.

From 1964 to 1978, the Giants registered only two winning seasons and no playoff appearances. With players, such as Tittle and Gifford approaching their mid 30s, the team declined rapidly, finishing 2–10–2 in 1964. They rebounded with a 7–7 record in 1965, before compiling a league-worst 1–12–1 record, and allowing more than 500 points on defense in 1966. During the 1969 preseason, the Giants lost their first meeting with the New York Jets, 37–14, in front of 70,874 fans at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut. Following the game, Wellington Mara fired coach Allie Sherman, and replaced him with former Giants fullback Alex Webster.
In 1967, the team acquired quarterback Fran Tarkenton from the Minnesota Vikings. Despite having several respectable seasons with Tarkenton at quarterback, including a 7–7 finish in 1967 and 9–5 in 1970, the Giants traded him back to the Vikings after a 4–10 finish in 1971. Tarkenton would go on to lead the Vikings to three Super Bowls and earn a place in the Hall of Fame, while the Giants suffered through one of the worst stretches in their history, winning only 23 games from 1973 to 1979. Before the 1976 season, the Giants tried to revive a weak offense by replacing retired RB Ron Johnson with future Hall of Fame fullback Larry Csonka, but Csonka was often injured and ineffective during his 3 years in New York. The 1977 season featured a roster which included three rookie quarterbacks.

The Giants were allowed to play their home games at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut in 1973 and 1974, and at Shea Stadium (home of the Mets and Jets) in Queens, New York in 1975, due to the renovation of Yankee Stadium. They finally moved into their own dedicated state-of-the-art stadium in 1976, when they moved into Giants Stadium at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, New Jersey, located 5 miles west of New York City. One of the low points during this period was the play known as the &quot;Miracle at the Meadowlands&quot;, which occurred in 1978. With the Giants trying to kill the clock and secure a win against the Philadelphia Eagles, offensive coordinator, Bob Gibson, chose to call a running play. This resulted in &quot;The Fumble&quot; by QB Joe Pisarcik that was returned for a game-winning touchdown by the Eagles&#x27; Herman Edwards.
The Giants&#x27; front office operations were complicated by a long-standing feud between Wellington Mara and his nephew, Tim Mara. Jack Mara had died in 1965, leaving his share of the club to his son Tim. Wellington and Tim&#x27;s personal styles and their visions for the club clashed, and eventually they stopped talking to each other. NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle intervened and appointed a neutral general manager, George Young, allowing the club to operate more smoothly. The feud became moot on February 20, 1991, when Tim Mara sold his shares in the club to Preston Robert Tisch.

In 1979, the Giants began the steps that would, in time, return them to the pinnacle of the NFL. These included the drafting of quarterback Phil Simms in 1979, and linebacker Lawrence Taylor in 1981. In 1981, Taylor won the NFL&#x27;s Defensive Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year awards and the Giants made the playoffs for the first time since 1963. One of the few bright spots during this time was the team&#x27;s excellent linebackers, who were known as the Crunch Bunch. After the strike-shortened 1982 season, in which they finished 4–5, head coach Ray Perkins resigned to succeed the legendary Bear Bryant as head coach at the University of Alabama. In a change that would prove crucial in the coming years, he was replaced by the team&#x27;s defensive coordinator, Bill Parcells.

====Bill Parcells years (1983–1990)====
In 1983, Bill Parcells was promoted to head coach from defensive coordinator. One of his first moves was to change his starting quarterback, sitting the injury-prone and struggling Phil Simms (who had missed the entire 1982 season with an injury) and electing instead to go with Scott Brunner, who had gone 4–5 as the starter in place of Simms in the strike-shortened previous season. Parcells went as far as to demote Simms to the third-string position, promoting Jeff Rutledge over Simms to be Brunner&#x27;s backup. Parcells later said the move was a mistake and one he &quot;nearly paid for dearly&quot; as the team finished with a 3–12–1 record and his job security was called into question.

In the off-season the Giants released Brunner and named Simms the starter. The move paid off as the team won nine games and returned to the playoffs. After beating the Los Angeles Rams in the wild-card round, the Giants prepared for a showdown against the top-seeded San Francisco 49ers. The 49ers defeated the Giants 21–10 in the divisional round.

=====Super Bowl XXI champions (1986)=====
After 9–7 and 10–6 finishes in 1984 and 1985 respectively, the Giants compiled a 14–2 record in 1986 led by league MVP and Defensive Player of the Year Lawrence Taylor and the Big Blue Wrecking Crew defense. As of 2023, this is the Giants&#x27; best regular season record since the NFL began playing 16-game seasons in 1978. After clinching the top seed in the NFC, the Giants defeated the 49ers 49–3 in the divisional round of the NFC playoffs and the Redskins 17–0 in the NFC championship game, advancing to their first Super Bowl, Super Bowl XXI, against the Denver Broncos at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. Led by MVP Simms who completed 22 of 25 passes for a Super Bowl record 88% completion percentage, they defeated the Broncos 39–20, to win their first championship since 1956. In addition to Phil Simms and Lawrence Taylor, the team was led during this period by head coach Bill Parcells, tight end Mark Bavaro, running back Joe Morris, and Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson.

The Giants struggled to a 6–9 record in the strike-marred 1987 season, due largely to a decline in the running game, as Morris managed only 658 yards behind an injury-riddled offensive line. The early portion of the 1988 season was marred by a scandal involving Lawrence Taylor. Taylor had abused cocaine and was suspended for the first four games of the season for his second violation of the league&#x27;s substance-abuse policy. Despite the controversy, the Giants finished 10–6, and Taylor recorded 15.5 sacks after his return from the suspension; however, the team missed the playoffs in their last game of the season. They surged to a 12–4 record in 1989, but lost to the Los Angeles Rams in their opening playoff game when Flipper Anderson caught a 47-yard touchdown pass to give the Rams a 19–13 overtime win.

=====Super Bowl XXV champions (1990)=====
In 1990, the Giants went 13–3 and, at the time, set an NFL record for fewest turnovers in a season (14). They defeated the San Francisco 49ers, who were attempting to win the Super Bowl for an unprecedented third straight year, 15–13 at San Francisco and then defeated the Buffalo Bills 20–19 in Super Bowl XXV.

===Mara and Tisch era (1991–present)===
Following the 1990 season, Parcells resigned as head coach and was replaced by the team&#x27;s offensive-line coach Ray Handley. Handley served as coach for two disappointing seasons (1991 and 1992), which saw the Giants fall from Super Bowl champions to an 8–8 record in 1991 and a 6–10 record in 1992. He was fired following the 1992 season, and replaced by former Denver Broncos&#x27; coach Dan Reeves. In the early 1990s, Simms and Taylor, two of the stars of the 1980s, played out the last seasons of their careers with steadily declining production. The Giants experienced a resurgent season with Reeves at the helm in 1993 however, and Simms and Taylor ended their careers as members of a playoff team.

The Giants initially struggled in the post Simms/Taylor era. After starting 3–7 in 1994, the Giants won their final six games to finish 9–7 but missed the playoffs. Quarterback Dave Brown received heavy criticism throughout the season. Brown performed poorly the following two seasons, and the Giants struggled to 5–11 and 6–10 records. Reeves was fired following the 1996 season.

====Jim Fassel years (1997–2003)====
In 1997, the Giants named Jim Fassel, who had spent the previous season as offensive coordinator of the Arizona Cardinals, as their 16th head coach. Fassel named Danny Kanell the team&#x27;s starting quarterback. The Giants finished the 1997 season with a record of 10–5–1 and qualified for the playoffs for the first time in four years. However, they lost in the wild-card round to the Vikings at home. The following year, the Giants began the season 4–8 before rallying to finish the season 8–8. One of the notable games of that season was a win over the eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos in week 15, giving the Broncos their first loss of the season after starting 13–0.

Before the 1999 season, the Giants signed ex-Carolina Panthers quarterback Kerry Collins. Collins was the first-ever draft choice of the expansion Carolina Panthers in 1995 and led the Panthers to the NFC Championship game in his second season. However, problems with alcohol, conflicts with his teammates, and questions about his character led to his release from the Panthers. The Giants finished the season with a 7–9 record, Fassel&#x27;s first losing season as head coach.

In 2000, the Giants were looking to make the playoffs for the first time in three seasons. The Giants started the season 7–2, but suffered back-to-back home losses to St. Louis and Detroit to make their record 7–4 and call their playoff prospects into question. At a press conference following the Giants&#x27; loss to Detroit, Fassel guaranteed that &quot;this team is going to the playoffs&quot;. The Giants responded, winning the rest of their regular season games to finish the season 12–4 and clinch the top seed in the NFC. In the divisional round, the Giants beat the Philadelphia Eagles 20–10 at home to qualify for the NFC Championship Game, in which they defeated the Minnesota Vikings 41–0. They advanced to play the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV. Though the Giants went into halftime down only 10–0, the Ravens dominated the second half. Their defense harassed Kerry Collins all game long, resulting in Collins completing only 15 of 39 passes for 112 yards and 4 interceptions. The Ravens won the game 34–7.

After a disappointing 7–9 record in 2001, the Giants finished the 2002 season with a record of 10–6, qualifying for the playoffs as a wild card. This set up a meeting with the San Francisco 49ers in Candlestick Park in the wild-card round. The Giants built up a sizable lead throughout the game and led 38–14 with 4:27 left in the third quarter. However, San Francisco rallied to win the game by one point, with the final score of 39–38.

After a dismal 2003 season in which the Giants finished with a 4–12 record, Jim Fassel was released by the Giants. His head coaching record with the Giants during this time was 58–53–1.

====Tom Coughlin years (2004–2015)====
In 2004, three years after their last Super Bowl appearance, Fassel was replaced by Tom Coughlin. Although Collins had several solid seasons as the Giants quarterback, he experienced his share of struggles. In 2004, the Giants completed a draft day trade for University of Mississippi quarterback Eli Manning. Manning became the team&#x27;s starting quarterback in the middle of the 2004 season, taking over for Kurt Warner. During the three-year period from 2004 to 2006, Tom Coughlin&#x27;s Giants compiled a 25–23 regular season record and two appearances in the wild-card round — both losses (to the Carolina Panthers in 2005 and to the Philadelphia Eagles in 2006.) and spawned intense media scrutiny concerning the direction of the team. During this period in their history, standout players included defensive end Michael Strahan, who set the NFL single season record in sacks in 2001, and running back Tiki Barber, who set a team record for rushing yards in a season in 2005. Barber retired at the end of the 2006 season.

=====Super Bowl XLII champions (2007)=====
Going into 2007, the Giants had made the playoffs in back-to-back seasons. In 2007, the Giants became the third NFL franchise to win at least 600 games when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 31–10 on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. For the 2007 season, the NFL scheduled the Giants&#x27; road game against the Miami Dolphins on October 28 in London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium; this was the first NFL regular season game to be played outside of North America. The Giants defeated the Dolphins, 13–10. The Giants finished 10–6 and became NFC Champions after defeating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Dallas Cowboys, and Green Bay Packers in the NFC Playoffs. They set a record for most consecutive road wins in a single season with 10 (a streak which ended with a loss to the Cleveland Browns during week 6 of the 2008 season).
The Patriots (18–0) entered the Super Bowl undefeated and were 12-point favorites going into game weekend. The Giants defeated the Patriots 17–14 in Super Bowl XLII, aided by the famous &quot;Manning to Tyree&quot; pass. On this famous play, Manning escaped the grip of several Patriots defensive linemen, stepped up in the pocket, and heaved the ball down the middle of the field to a double-covered David Tyree. With Rodney Harrison, a Patriots defensive back, all over Tyree, David managed to hold on to the ball by holding it on his helmet until he fell to the ground. This catch set up a Manning to Plaxico Burress touchdown pass in the back of the end zone to put the Giants in the lead. It was the third biggest upset by betting line in Super Bowl history (the Baltimore Colts were favored by 17 over the New York Jets in Super Bowl III, and the St. Louis Rams were favored by 14 over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI). Co-owner John Mara described it as &quot;the greatest victory in the history of this franchise, without question&quot;.

The Giants began the 2008 season with a record of 11–1 but lost three of their last four regular season games partially due to a self-inflicted gunshot wound to wide receiver Plaxico Burress. However, the Giants still won the NFC East with a record of 12–4, and clinched the number one seed in the NFC after beating the Carolina Panthers for home-field advantage and a first-round bye. In the divisional round of the playoffs, the Giants lost 23–11 to the Philadelphia Eagles at home.

In 2009, the Giants opened a new training complex, the Timex Performance Center, also located in the Meadowlands. After starting 5–0 in the 2009 season, New York lost to the likewise undefeated New Orleans Saints at the Louisiana Superdome 48–27, beginning a four-game losing streak, in which they lost to the Arizona Cardinals 24–17, the San Diego Chargers 21–20 and the Philadelphia Eagles 40–17. The streak was broken with a 34–31 overtime victory against the Atlanta Falcons. On Thanksgiving night, they lost to the Denver Broncos 26–6. The Giants next beat the division-leading Dallas Cowboys. A week later, with a record of 7–5, they lost to the Philadelphia Eagles, 45–38. On December 27, the Giants lost to the Carolina Panthers 41–9 in their final game at Giants Stadium and were eliminated from playoff eligibility. The Giants finished the season 8–8.

Following the season, the Giants fired first-year defensive coordinator Bill Sheridan, and replaced him with the former Buffalo Bills interim head coach, Perry Fewell. The Giants defense finished 13th overall under Sheridan, giving up 324.9 yards per game, and the final two losses of the season against Carolina and Minnesota, in which the Giants gave up 85 points, ultimately led to the firing.
In 2010, the Giants moved from Giants Stadium into MetLife Stadium, then known as the &quot;New Meadowlands Stadium&quot;. They won against the Carolina Panthers in the first game at New Meadowlands Stadium but then lost to the Indianapolis Colts in the second &quot;Manning Bowl&quot;, so-called due to Eli Manning&#x27;s brother Peyton playing for the Colts. The Giants dropped one game to the Tennessee Titans before going on a five-game winning streak, beating the Chicago Bears, Houston Texans, Detroit Lions, Dallas Cowboys, and Seattle Seahawks. Before long, the Giants were 6–2 but lost two straight to division foes: to the Cowboys 33–20 at home, and to the Philadelphia Eagles on the road, putting the Giants in second place in the NFC East at 6–4. In first place was the Eagles, but at December 19 the two teams tied at 8–4, setting up a match for first place. The Giants were at home and led 24–3 over the Eagles at halftime. The score was 31–10 with 5:40 left in the game, but Michael Vick led the Eagles to three touchdown drives to tie the game up at 31 with 40 seconds left. After a Giants three-and-out, Matt Dodge punted the ball to DeSean Jackson, who returned it for a touchdown, concluding the Giants&#x27; epic collapse. The next game, the Giants lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers 45–17, and at 9–6, they faced the Redskins. They had to win and have the Packers lose in order to get into the playoffs. The Giants won 17–14, but the Packers beat the Bears 10–3, so the Giants missed out on the playoffs again, ending a collapse in which the Giants went 4–4 in their last eight games.

=====Super Bowl XLVI champions (2011)=====

During the 2011 preseason, the Giants lost Kevin Boss, Steve Smith, Rich Seubert, Keith Bulluck, Derek Hagan, and Pro Bowl center Shaun O&#x27;Hara to free agency. However, the season also saw the emergence of second-year wide receiver Victor Cruz and second-year tight end Jake Ballard. The Giants opened their season with a 28–14 loss to the Washington Redskins at FedEx Field on the 10th anniversary of the September 11th attacks. However, the Giants secured a 6–2 record by the midpoint of the season, including road victories over the Philadelphia Eagles and the New England Patriots. The latter victory ended the Patriots&#x27; NFL record home-game winning streak, after a touchdown pass from Manning to Jake Ballard with 15 seconds left in the game.

However, the Giants then suffered a four-game losing streak, including road losses against the resurgent San Francisco 49ers and the New Orleans Saints and home losses to the Eagles and the then-undefeated Green Bay Packers, to make their record 6–6 entering December. The Giants broke their losing streak with a tightly contested 37–34 road victory over the Cowboys on December 11 with Jason Pierre-Paul blocking a last second field goal attempt, but lost at home to the Washington Redskins the following week to make their record 7–7 with a Christmas Eve showdown against their crosstown rival New York Jets the following week. The Giants won, 29–14, and knocked the Eagles out of playoff contention, to set up a Week 17 home game against the Cowboys in which the winner would clinch the NFC East while the loser would be eliminated from playoff contention. The game was flexed into Sunday Night Football. The Giants defeated the Cowboys, 31–14 and clinched the NFC East title and the fourth seed in the playoffs. Wide receiver Victor Cruz finished the regular season with 1,536 receiving yards, breaking the Giants franchise record previously held by Amani Toomer.

On January 8, 2012, in the first round of the playoffs, the Giants defeated the Atlanta Falcons 24–2. After giving up an early safety in the first half, quarterback Eli Manning threw for three consecutive touchdowns. Running backs Ahmad Bradshaw and Brandon Jacobs combined for 172 yards rushing, a season-high for the Giants. With the victory, the Giants advanced to the second round against the top-ranked Green Bay Packers 37–20.

On January 15, 2012, the Giants defeated the Green Bay Packers 37–20. Eli Manning threw for 330 yards and 3 touchdowns, two of which to wide receiver Hakeem Nicks. This earned the Giants a spot in the NFC Championship Game on January 22, 2012, against the San Francisco 49ers. They won this game 20–17, in overtime, with Tynes scoring the winning field goal as he did four years earlier in the same game against the Packers.

The New York Giants won Super Bowl XLVI against the New England Patriots with a score of 21–17. The winning touchdown was preceded by a 38-yard reception by receiver Mario Manningham. As in Super Bowl XLII, Eli Manning was Super Bowl MVP, defeating the Patriots for a second time in the Super Bowl.

Ahmad Bradshaw scored the game-winning touchdown by falling into the end zone. The Patriots were allowing Bradshaw to get the touchdown so they would get the ball with some time remaining. When Eli Manning handed the ball to Bradshaw, he told him not to score. Bradshaw was about to fall down at the 1-yard line but his momentum carried him in, thus the &quot;reluctant touchdown.&quot;

As was the case in each of their four previous Super Bowl appearances, the Giants trailed at halftime. They are the only team in NFL history to have more than two second half, come-from-behind, Super Bowl victories (4). The Pittsburgh Steelers, who accomplished the feat in Super Bowl X and Super Bowl XIV, are the only other team to do it more than once.

The Giants began the 2012 season with a home loss to the Dallas Cowboys, but rebounded to finish October with a 6–2 record and on a four-game winning streak that included a 26–3 road victory against the eventual NFC champion San Francisco 49ers. Following the arrival of Hurricane Sandy in the Northeastern United States, the Giants lost back-to-back games against the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cincinnati Bengals to fall to 6–4. Despite impressive blowout home victories over the Green Bay Packers, New Orleans Saints and Philadelphia Eagles, the Giants finished the season 9–7 and out of the playoffs. Quarterback Eli Manning, defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul, wide receiver Victor Cruz, and guard Chris Snee represented the Giants at the Pro Bowl.

The 2013 season began with hope that the Giants could become the first team to play in the Super Bowl in their home stadium, as MetLife Stadium was scheduled to host Super Bowl XLVIII that February. However, the Giants&#x27; playoff hopes took a massive hit when they lost the first six games of the season. They rebounded to win the next four games in a row to improve to 4–6, but lost a critical home game to the Dallas Cowboys on a last-minute field goal. They finished the season 7–9 and with a losing record for the first time since 2004. The Giants drafted rookie wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. in the 2014 NFL draft, who would later go on to win the AP Offensive Rookie of the Year award. However, the Giants missed the playoffs for a third straight season, finishing with a 6–10 record. The 2015 season was another disappointing campaign, as the Giants showcased a struggling defense and several late-game collapses. The Giants finished the season with a 6–10 record and missed the playoffs.

====2016–present====
On January 14, 2016, the Giants announced that Ben McAdoo would become the team&#x27;s head coach. He replaced Tom Coughlin, who had resigned the previous week. The Giants turned it around in 2016 with an 11–5 record, ending their five-year playoff drought. The Giants later lost to the Green Bay Packers 38–13 in the wild-card round.
After having high expectations due to their 11–5 record in 2016, the Giants had an unexpected 0–5 start to the 2017 season, before pulling a massive upset versus the Denver Broncos at Sports Authority Field at Mile High for their first win of the season. However, during the Week 5 game against the Los Angeles Chargers, Odell Beckham Jr. fractured his ankle, an injury that ended his season. During the same game, the Giants also lost wide receivers Brandon Marshall and Dwayne Harris to season-ending injuries. The season was also marred by the suspensions of Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and Janoris Jenkins. The Giants finished the 2017 season with a 3–13 record, the second-worst in the league. This was also the first time since 1983 in which the Giants finished the regular season with three or less wins, and their worst record since the 16 game season was adopted in the NFL.

The season was also highlighted the controversial benching of longtime quarterback Eli Manning in Week 13, and the high-profile firings of head coach Ben McAdoo and general manager Jerry Reese, who were the first mid-season staff firings since the 1976 Giants&#x27; season. Manning was eventually renamed the starter in Week 14. Subsequently, the disastrous season led to the team being awarded the second overall pick in the 2018 NFL draft, which they utilized to select Saquon Barkley from Penn State. Despite Barkley&#x27;s selection, several questions pertained into the following season around the team&#x27;s offensive line and long-term future at quarterback.

The 2018 season began with Pat Shurmur being hired as the new head coach. Despite starting 1–7 for the second consecutive year, the Giants managed to marginally improve on their 3–13 campaign by finishing the season 5–11 in a 30–27 overtime win against the Chicago Bears. After defeating the Washington Redskins in Week 14, the Giants became the first team in NFL history to win 100 regular season games against an opponent. However, this ensured last place in the NFC East for the second straight year, marking the first time they were division rock bottom in back-to-back years since 1977 and 1978. The season was also highlighted by blown fourth-quarter leads which was similar to their 2015 team, where the Giants were in 12 one-possession games, and lost 8 of those by 7 points or less. Following the season&#x27;s end, the team was placed to select sixth overall in the 2019 NFL draft. Barkley impressed in his rookie season, breaking several NFL and Giants team records for a rookie, including having the most receptions by a running back (91), most rushing touchdowns (11), most rushing yards (1,307), and most touchdowns in a season (15). He was also selected to the 2019 Pro Bowl, alongside fellow teammates Olivier Vernon, Landon Collins, and Aldrick Rosas in addition to winning offensive rookie of the year honors.

The team used their sixth overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft on Duke quarterback Daniel Jones. The Giants went 4–12 in the 2019 season. After the 2019 season, the Giants&#x27; longtime quarterback, Eli Manning, retired after spending 16 seasons with the organization, while the team finished the season with a 4–12 record. Following the season, Shurmur was fired as head coach. Prior to the 2020 season, the Giants hired Joe Judge as head coach. At the start of the 2020 season, Daniel Jones took over as starting quarterback as the Giants finished 6–10, while tight end Evan Engram and cornerback James Bradberry were named to the 2021 Pro Bowl as reserves.

In the 2021 season the Giants failed to improve on their 2020 record by finishing 4–13. Then after the season, general manager Dave Gettleman retired and head coach Joe Judge was fired. During the season the squad&#x27;s starting quarterback Daniel Jones sprained his neck and was temporarily replaced in the lineup by Mike Glennon and then Jake Fromm.

On January 21, 2022, the team hired Joe Schoen as the team&#x27;s general manager, and on January 28, hired Brian Daboll as the team&#x27;s new head coach. The 2022 season showed a much improved record, with the Giants finishing 9–7–1. On January 1, 2023, the Giants clinched a playoff berth for the first time since the 2016 season. On January 15, the Giants defeated the Minnesota Vikings 31–24 in the wild-card round, winning their first postseason game since their victory at Super Bowl XLVI in 2012. The Giants proceeded to lose the next game to the eventual NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles 38–7 in the divisional round.

In the 2023 season, the Giants regressed on their successful 2022 season, finishing 6–11. Daniel Jones was injured several times in the season and was placed on injured reserve after tearing his ACL in week 9. He was temporarily replaced in the lineup by Tyrod Taylor and Tommy DeVito.

==Championships==
The Giants have won a total of eight league championships: 1927, 1934, 1938, 1956, 1986, 1990, 2007 and 2011. The first four of those championships came in the pre-Super Bowl era. New York&#x27;s eight championships put them third among all active and defunct NFL teams, trailing only the Green Bay Packers (13) and the Chicago Bears (9).

===NFL championships (pre-Super Bowl era)===
Before the Super Bowl was instituted, the Giants won four officially recognized NFL championships.

===Super Bowl championships===
The Giants have won four Super Bowls, tied with Green Bay for the fifth most behind Dallas, San Francisco (both with 5), and New England and Pittsburgh (6 each).

===NFC championships===
The Giants have won five NFC Championship Games, including two in overtime in 2007 and 2011.

==Logos and uniforms==
With nearly 100 years of team history, the Giants have used numerous uniforms and logos, while maintaining a consistent identity. The Giants&#x27; logos include several incarnations of a giant quarterback preparing to throw a football, a lowercase &quot;ny&quot;, and stylized versions of the team nickname.

Giants&#x27; jerseys are traditionally blue or red (or white with blue or red accents), and their pants alternate between white and gray. Currently, the Giants wear home jerseys that are solid blue with white block numbering, white pants with five thin blue/gray/red/gray/blue stripes on the pant legs, and solid blue socks. For this they gained their most renowned nickname, &quot;Big Blue&quot;. For road uniforms, they wear a white jersey with red block numbering and red &quot;Northwestern&quot; stripes on the sleeves, gray pants with three thin non-contiguous red/blue/red stripes on the pant legs, and solid red socks. The Giants&#x27; current helmet is metallic blue with white block numbers, which are frontally mounted and base mounted on either side of a red stripe running down the center or frontally mounted and base mounted on the red center stripe itself. The Giants, along with the Pittsburgh Steelers, are one of only two teams in the NFL to have the players&#x27; uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets. The helmet is adorned on both sides with the stylized white lower case &quot;ny&quot; logo and features a gray facemask. The home uniforms are generally similar to the design used from 1966 to 1974, but with some slight elements from the 1956–1961 uniforms. The road uniforms are essentially a modernization of the design used from 1956 to 1961. Additionally, the Giants had a third jersey until the 2009 season, which recalled the Giants&#x27; solid red home jerseys from the early 1950s: a solid red alternate with white block numbers. These jerseys were used a total of four times, but have since been retired. They were used once in 2004 against the Philadelphia Eagles and in three consecutive years – 2005, 2006, and 2007 – against the Dallas Cowboys.

==Ownerships, financial history and fan base==

The Giants have had a long and, at times, turbulent financial history. The team was founded by Tim Mara with an investment of US$500 in 1925 and became one of the first teams in the then five-year-old NFL. To differentiate themselves from the baseball team of the same name, they took the name &quot;New York Football Giants&quot;, which they still use as their legal corporate name.

Although the Giants were successful on the field in their initial seasons, their financial status was a different story. Overshadowed by baseball, boxing, and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925. The Giants were in dire financial straits until the 11th game of the season when Red Grange and the Chicago Bears came to town, attracting over 73,000 fans. This gave the Giants a much needed influx of revenue, and perhaps altered the history of the franchise. The following year, Grange and his agent formed a rival league and stationed a competing team, led by Grange, in New York. Though the Giants lost $50,000 that season, the rival league folded and was subsumed into the NFL. Following the 1930 season, Mara transferred ownership of the team over to his two sons to insulate the team from creditors, and by 1946, he had given over complete control of the team to them. Jack, the older son, controlled the business aspects, while Wellington controlled the on-field operations. After their initial struggles the Giants financial status stabilized, and they led the league in attendance several times in the 1930s and 1940s.
By the early 1960s, the Giants had firmly established themselves as one of the league&#x27;s biggest attractions. However, rather than continuing to receive their higher share of the league television revenue, the Mara sons pushed for equal sharing of revenue for the benefit of the entire league. Revenue sharing is still practiced in the NFL today, and is credited with strengthening the league. After their struggles in the latter half of the 1960s and the entire 1970s, the Giants hired an outsider, George Young, to run the football operations for the first time in franchise history. The Giants&#x27; on-field product and business aspects improved rapidly following the move.
In 1991, Tim Mara, grandson of the founder, was struggling with cancer and sold his half of the team to Bob Tisch for a reported $80 million. This marked the first time in franchise history the team had not been solely owned by the Mara family. In 2005, Wellington Mara, who had been with the team since its inception in 1925 when he worked as a ball boy, died at the age of 89. His death was followed two weeks later by the death of Tisch. In 2015, Wellington&#x27;s widow and Giants co-owner Ann died due to complications from a head injury suffered in a fall. She was 85 years old.

In 2010, MetLife Stadium opened, replacing Giants Stadium. The new stadium is a 50/50 partnership between the Giants and Jets, and while the stadium is owned by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority on paper, the two teams jointly built the stadium using private funds, and administer it jointly through New Meadowlands Stadium Corporation. The Giants had previously planned a $300 million renovation to the Meadowlands, before deciding in favor of the new stadium which was originally estimated to cost approximately $600 million, before rising to an estimated cost of one billion dollars. One advantage gained by owning the stadium is that the teams saved considerable money in tax payments. The teams leased the land from the state at a cost of $6.3 million per year. The state paid for all utilities, including the $30 million needed to install them.

The Giants are owned and operated by John Mara and Steve Tisch. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine estimated the value of the team in 2012 to be $1.3 billion. This ranks the New York Giants as the fourth most valuable franchise in the NFL and the ninth most valuable professional sports franchise in the world. The value has steadily increased from $288 million in 1998, to their current value. The magazine estimated their revenue in 2006 at $182 million, of which $46 million came from gate receipts. Operating income was $26.9 million, and player salary was $102 million. Current major sponsors include Gatorade, Anheuser Busch, Toyota, and Verizon Wireless. Recent former sponsors include Miller Brewing and North Fork Bank. Luxury suites, retail and game day concessions at the new stadium are provisioned and operated by global hospitality giant Delaware North. The team&#x27;s average ticket price is $72.

The Giants draw their fans from the New York metropolitan area. Since their move to New Jersey in 1976, fans from each state have claimed the team as their own. In January 1987, shortly before the team won Super Bowl XXI, then New York City mayor Ed Koch labeled the team &quot;foreigners&quot; and said they were not entitled to a ticker-tape parade in New York City. On February 5, 2008, the city, under mayor Michael Bloomberg, threw a ticker tape parade in honor of the Giants&#x27; Super Bowl XLII victory at the Canyon of Heroes in lower Manhattan. New York City held another ticker tape parade on February 7, 2012, in honor of the Giants&#x27; Super Bowl XLVI victory. According to a team spokesman, in 2001, 52 percent of the Giants&#x27; season ticket-holders lived in New Jersey. Most of the remaining ticket holders lived in New York State with some coming from other states. The Giants also draw fans from the Canadian province of Quebec mostly due to the province sharing a significant international border with New York State — New York City is only five to six hours away from Montreal by car.

Through the lean years of the 1960s and 1970s the Giants, in spite of a 17-year-long playoff drought, still accumulated a 20-year-long waiting list for season tickets. It has been estimated that the Giants have a waiting list of 135,000 people, the largest of any North American professional sports franchise.

==Rivalries==
===Divisional===
====Philadelphia Eagles====

The rivalry between the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles is one of the oldest in the NFL, dating back to 1933. The two teams have frequently fought for playoff contention, NFC East titles, and respect. While the Giants have dominated this rivalry throughout most of its history, the series began to even after the 1980s, with the Eagles going 22–21 against New York through the 1990s and 2000s. Philadelphia then dominated New York in the 2010s with a 16–4 record to claim their first lead in the series. The Eagles lead the all-time series 94–89–2 as of the 2023 season. The two teams have met five times in the postseason, with the Giants winning two games to the Eagles three. Three of those four playoff meetings were held in the 2000s decade. New York City and Philadelphia have a strong geographic rivalry, as seen in other professional sports such as the Mets–Phillies rivalry in Major League Baseball, and the Flyers–Rangers, Flyers–Islanders and Devils–Flyers rivalries in the National Hockey League.

====Washington Commanders====
The Giants have an old and storied rivalry with the Washington Commanders, dating back to 1932. While this rivalry is typically given less significance than the rivalries with the Eagles and Cowboys, there have been periods of great competition between the two. In the 1980s the Giants and Redskins, as they were then known, clashed as both struggled against each other for division titles and even Super Bowl Championships. Most notable among these is the 1986 NFC Championship game in which the Giants defeated the Redskins 17–0 to earn their first ever trip to the Super Bowl. Wellington Mara always felt this was the Giants oldest and truest rival, and after passing away in 2005, the Giants honored their longtime owner by defeating the Redskins 36–0 at home. The Giants lead this series 107–70–4 as of the 2023 season. The Giants 107 wins against the Washington Redskins are the most wins for one team against one opponent in NFL history.

====Dallas Cowboys====

The Giants have maintained a fierce divisional rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys since the Cowboys first began play in 1960. The two teams have a combined nine Super Bowl victories between them, and have played many games in which the NFC East title was at stake. The rivalry is unique among professional sports as it is the only divisional rivalry between sports teams from New York City and Dallas, partially due to the large distance between the two cities. The Cowboys lead the regular season series 75–47–2, while the Giants hold the lone playoff victory between the two teams, held at the conclusion of the 2007 season.

===Conference===
====San Francisco 49ers====

Despite never being in the same division, the Giants and San Francisco 49ers have developed a heated rivalry over the years. The two teams have met eight times in the playoffs (including two NFC Championship Games, both won by New York) since 1982, which is the most of any two teams in that span. In the overall series the 49ers lead 22–21, while the postseason series are also tied 4–4. Five of the eight times the Giants and 49ers have played in the postseason, the winner of their game has gone on to win the Super Bowl.

===Inter Conference===
====New York Jets====

The Giants and New York Jets for many years had the only intracity rivalry in the NFL, made even more unusual by sharing a stadium. They have met annually in the preseason since 1969. Since 2011, this meeting has been known as the &quot;MetLife Bowl&quot;, after the naming sponsor of the teams&#x27; stadium. Regular season matchups between the teams occur once every four years, as they follow the NFL scheduling formula for interconference games. Since the two teams play each other so infrequently in the regular season, some, including players on both teams, have questioned whether the Giants and Jets have a real rivalry. A memorable regular season game was in 1988, when the Giants faced off against the Jets in the last game of the season, needing a victory to make the playoffs. The Jets played spoiler, however, beating the Giants 27–21 and ruining the latter&#x27;s playoff hopes. A different scenario unfolded during the penultimate regular season game of 2011 as the &quot;visiting&quot; Giants defeated the Jets 29–14. The victory simultaneously helped eliminate the Jets from playoff contention and propel the Giants to their own playoff run and eventual win in Super Bowl XLVI. The Giants lead the overall regular season series 8–7.

====New England Patriots====

The Giants and New England Patriots rarely played each other given they were on opposite conferences, but the rivalry gained notoriety in the late 2000s thanks to some close contests and memorable moments between Tom Brady and Eli Manning. In the 2007 season, the Patriots defeated the Giants 38–35 to clinch a perfect 16–0 regular season, but could not finish a perfect 19–0 season in Super Bowl XLII following a 17–14 defeat. That game featured the now-iconic Helmet Catch from David Tyree. The Giants also defeated the Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI, a 21–17 victory. As of the 2023 season, the all-time series is tied 7–7.

===Historic===
====Chicago Bears====

The Giants and Chicago Bears squared off in six NFL championship games, more than any common matchup in either the NFL championship game or Super Bowl. Though the Bears won four of the six championship games, one of the Giants&#x27; two championship victories included the Sneakers Game that took place in the 1934 NFL Championship Game. The two teams also met in the 1985 and 1990 playoffs, splitting each meeting en route to a Super Bowl championship (Bears in Super Bowl XX, Giants in Super Bowl XXV). The Bears lead the all-time series 36–24–2, including a 5–3 postseason record.

==== Green Bay Packers ====

The Giants–Packers rivalry is a National Football League (NFL) rivalry between the New York Giants and the Green Bay Packers. The two teams have played since 1970 in the National Football Conference, and they play each other in the regular season either every three years or depending on its NFC division placement, and in the postseason, The Packers lead the all-time series 34–28–2 and postseason series 5–3.

==Players==
===Current roster===
===Retired numbers===
;Notes:
* 1 Retired in 1935, this was the first number to be retired in professional football. The number was unretired in 2024 for Malik Nabers after he received permission to wear it from the Flaherty family. 
* 2 The Giants retired the #3 in honor of tackle and team captain Len Grant, who was killed by a lightning strike while golfing just before training camp opened in 1938. His number was returned to service in 1966 at the request of Pete Gogolak and has remained in use. 
* 3 The number 14 was retired in honor of Ward Cuff in 1946. Y. A. Tittle requested 14 after the Giants traded for him in 1961, and it was retired a second time in 1964 at the conclusion of Tittle&#x27;s playing career. The number is now retired in honor of both players.
* 4 Posthumous honor.

===Pro Football Hall of Famers===
In the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the Giants boast the second-most enshrined members with 29. Tim Mara, Mel Hein, Pete Henry, Cal Hubbard and Jim Thorpe were a part of the original class of inductees in 1963, while defensive end Michael Strahan, the most recent Giant inducted, was a part of the Class of 2014. Numerous members, including Larry Csonka, Ray Flaherty, Joe Guyon, Pete Henry, Arnie Herber, Cal Hubbard, Tom Landry, Don Maynard, Hugh McElhenny, Jim Thorpe, and Kurt Warner were at one time associated with the New York Giants, but they were inducted largely based on their careers with other teams.




===Ring of Honor===
The New York Giants unveiled their own Ring of Honor on October 3, 2010, during halftime of their Sunday Night Football matchup with the Chicago Bears. John Mara had long wished to create a Giants Ring of Honor and Hall of Fame to honor Giants who helped the franchise achieve each of their championships, and the building of MetLife Stadium resulted in the realization of that ambition. The organization had an inaugural induction class of 30 including players, coaches, owners and executives that have had a great impact on the organization. While the entire list of inductees was not revealed until the actual induction, the organization did confirm about a week before the ceremony that Phil Simms, Bill Parcells, Michael Strahan, Tiki Barber, Frank Gifford and Pete Gogolak would all be inducted.

===Current staff===
==Media, radio and television==

As of 2010, the Giants&#x27; flagship radio station is WFAN, with games simulcast on WFAN-FM as of November 2012. Since WFAN also has the rights to carry baseball, as they currently are the flagship station for the New York Yankees and previously served the same role for the New York Mets, early season Giants games come into conflict; since 2019, WFAN has split the coverage across both of its dial positions, with the Giants carried on 660 AM and the Yankees on 101.9 FM. Prior to that, the Giants&#x27; games would air on one of WFAN&#x27;s designated overflow stations.

Bob Papa on play-by-play and Carl Banks on color commentary are the Giants&#x27; radio broadcast team, with Howard Cross as the sideline reporter. When Papa is unavailable to call games Chris Carrino, WFAN&#x27;s lead broadcaster for the Brooklyn Nets, substitutes for him. Games are carried over the New York Giants Radio Network over various stations in New York, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut.

Preseason telecasts not seen nationally air in the area on WNBC, with WWOR-TV serving as an overflow station for when WNBC is airing other programming such as the Summer Olympic Games. Papa and Banks call these games on television, with studio host Paul Dottino as Papa&#x27;s substitute. 

WPIX-TV or WABC-TV will also air any Giants broadcast that is carried exclusively by ESPN, as per the local carriage rules (WABC-TV&#x27;s corporate parent, The Walt Disney Company, holds an 80% majority ownership stake in ESPN, and has a right of first refusal for these telecasts). Thursday Night Football broadcasts, which are streamed on Amazon Prime Video, are simulcast on WNYW.

The Giants&#x27; public address announcer at MetLife Stadium is Gordon Deal. Deal replaced Jim Hall, who for years was Bob Sheppard&#x27;s substitute at Yankee Stadium due to their very similar voices. Hall took over the Giants PA job after Sheppard elected to leave the position in 2005 to focus solely on his Yankee Stadium duties.

===Past===
WFAN has produced the Giants&#x27; radio broadcasts since 1995, but has not always aired them on the station. For 1995, then-Giants flagship WOR continued to carry the games as they had for the previous two seasons. In 1996 the games were simulcast on WFAN and WOR, which caused some conflict as at the time, WFAN was the radio flagship of the New York Jets as well. To remedy the situation, beginning the next year WFAN moved the Giants&#x27; radio broadcasts to the FM dial and sister station WNEW-FM, where they remained until the end of the 1999 season. In 2000 WFAN lost the Jets&#x27; radio contract to WABC and the Giants moved back to WFAN where they have been ever since.

The Giants&#x27; longtime radio home was WNEW, where games aired from the mid-1950s until 1993 when the station was bought by Bloomberg L.P. and changed its format. Marty Glickman teamed with Al DeRogatis for a long stretch beginning in the early 1960s on WNEW. Chip Cipolla and later Sam Huff joined Glickman after DeRogatis left to join Curt Gowdy on NBC. After the WNEW split, games began airing on WOR. Glickman moved to the crosstown Jets in 1973 and was succeeded by Marv Albert. Jim Gordon succeeded Albert in 1977, beginning an 18-year tenure as the Giants&#x27; play-by-play voice. Meanwhile, Dick Lynch took over as color analyst in 1976 and continued in that role through 2007, with his last game being Super Bowl XLII, and retired following the season due to his advancing leukemia, which took his life in September 2008.

Eventually Gordon and Lynch were joined by Karl Nelson, a former lineman for the Giants. Gordon and Nelson were fired after the 1994 season, after which Papa took over the play-by-play (after being studio host) and led a two-man booth with Lynch. Dave Jennings joined the broadcast team in 2002 following his firing by the Jets, with whom he had worked since his 1987 retirement from the NFL. Jennings was moved to the pregame show after the 2006 season and was replaced by Carl Banks, leaving broadcasting altogether in 2008 due to his ongoing battle with Parkinson&#x27;s disease that he lost in 2013.

After WFAN began airing games Richard Neer served as pregame and postgame host. He was replaced by Sid Rosenberg, who was in turn fired by the station due to troubles and replaced by Chris Carlin. Carlin left in 2008 to focus full-time on his duties as SNY studio host and Rutgers athletics radio voice and was replaced by WWOR sports reporter and former WFAN host Russ Salzberg, who cohosted with Roman Oben after Jennings left. WEPN Giants beat reporter Paul Dottino was hired by WFAN to host the pregame show for 2009 and continues to be a part of the program. As of the 2020 season, Lance Medow is the host for the pregame show as well as halftime and postgame, with former Giants punter Jeff Feagles as analyst.

The Giants were carried on the DuMont Network, then CBS in the early TV days of the NFL, when home games were blacked out within a 75-mile radius of New York City. Chris Schenkel was their play-by-play announcer in that early era when each team was assigned its own network voice on its regional telecasts. At the time, there were few if any true national telecasts until the NFL championship game, which was carried by NBC. Schenkel was joined by Jim McKay, later Johnny Lujack through the 1950s and the early 1960s. As Giants players retired to the broadcast booth in the early and 1960s, first Pat Summerall, then Frank Gifford took the color analyst slot next to Schenkel. As the 1970 merger of the NFL and AFL approached, CBS moved to a more generic announcer approach and Schenkel was off the broadcasts.

Giants regular season Sunday telecasts moved to Fox when that network took over NFC telecasts in 1994 and are carried locally by WNYW.

WCBS-TV and WPIX were previously home to Giants preseason telecasts in the 1990s, with WPIX serving as the Giants&#x27; (and Jets&#x27;) long-time preseason home. After the NFC rights were lost by CBS, the Giants followed the conference&#x27;s broadcast rights to WNYW. WWOR became the Giants&#x27; flagship TV station in the late 1990s, and stayed so up until WNBC took over rights in 2005.

When the Giants first moved to WNYW, Mike Breen was their preseason play-by-play man. Sam Rosen was the television voice for some time afterward, except for two years when Curt Menefee (then of WNYW) was the voice. When the games moved to WWOR, Rosen regained the position and held it until 2004. Former Giant receiver Phil McConkey became the early season analyst after his retirement and stayed in the booth for many years.
