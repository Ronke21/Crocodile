<text>Nichiren (16 February 1222 – 13 October 1282) was a Japanese Buddhist priest and philosopher of the Kamakura period. His teachings form the basis of Nichiren Buddhism, a branch of Mahayana Buddhism.

Nichiren declared that the Lotus Sutra alone contains the highest truth of Buddhist teachings suited for the Third Age of Buddhism, insisting that the sovereign of Japan and its people should support only this form of Buddhism and eradicate all others. He advocated the repeated recitation of its title, &quot;Nam(u)-myoho-renge-kyo&quot;, as the only path to Buddhahood and held that Shakyamuni Buddha and all other Buddhist deities were extraordinary manifestations of a particular Buddha-nature termed &quot;Myoho-Renge&quot; that is equally accessible to all. He declared that believers of the Sutra must propagate it even under persecution.

Nichiren was a prolific writer and his biography, temperament, and the evolution of his beliefs has been gleaned primarily from his writings. He claimed the reincarnation of Jōgyō bodhisattva in a past life, and designated six senior disciples, of which the claims to successorship are contested. After his death, he was bestowed the title by the Emperor Go-Kōgon in 1358 and the title was conferred posthumously through imperial edict by the Emperor Taishō in 1922.
Nichiren Buddhism today includes traditional temple schools such as Nichiren-shu sects and Nichiren Shōshū, as well as lay movements such as Soka Gakkai, Risshō Kōsei Kai, Reiyūkai, Kenshōkai, Honmon Butsuryū-shū, Kempon Hokke, and Shōshinkai among many others. Each group has varying views of Nichiren&#x27;s teachings with claims and interpretations of Nichiren&#x27;s identity ranging from the rebirth of Bodhisattva Visistacaritra to the of the Third Age of Buddhism.

== Overview ==
The main narrative of Nichiren&#x27;s life has been constructed from extant letters and treatises he wrote, counted in one collection as 523 complete writings and 248 fragments. Aside from historical documents stored in the repositories of various Nichiren sects, the first extensive non-religious biographical account of Nichiren did not appear until more than 200 years after his death.

He launched his teachings in 1253, advocating an exclusive return to the Lotus Sutra as based on its original Tendai interpretations. His 1260 treatise argued that a nation that embraces the Lotus Sutra will experience peace and prosperity whereas rulers who support inferior religious teachings invite disorder and disaster into their realms. In a 1264 essay, he stated that the title of the Lotus Sutra, &quot;Nam(u)-myoho-renge-kyo,&quot; encompasses all Buddhist teachings and its recitation leads to enlightenment. As a result of his adamant stance, he experienced severe persecution imposed by the Kamakura Shogunate and consequently began to see himself as &quot;bodily reading the Lotus Sutra (&quot;Jpn. Hokke shikidoku&quot;).&quot; In some of his writings during a second exile (1271–1274) he began to identify himself with the key Lotus Sutra characters Sadāparibhūta and Visistacaritra and saw himself in the role of leading a vast outpouring of Bodhisattvas of the Earth.

In 1274, after his two predictions of foreign invasion and political strife were seemingly actualized by the first attempted Mongol invasion of Japan along with an unsuccessful coup within the Hōjō clan, Nichiren was pardoned by the Shogunate authorities and his advice was sought but not heeded. The &quot;Risshō Ankoku Ron&quot; in which he first predicted foreign invasion and civil disorder is now considered by Japanese historians to be a literary classic illustrating the apprehensions of that period.

Several hagiographies about Nichiren and are reflected in various pieces of artwork about incidents in his life.

Nichiren remains a controversial figure among scholars who cast him as either a fervent nationalist or a social reformer with a transnational religious vision. Critical scholars have used words such as intolerant, nationalistic, militaristic, and self-righteous to portray him. On the other hand, Nichiren has been presented as a revolutionary, a classic reformer, and as a prophet. 
Nichiren is often compared to other religious figures who shared similar rebellious and revolutionary drives to reform degeneration in their respective societies or schools.

=== Birth ===
According to the lunar Chinese calendar, Nichiren was born on 16th of the second month in 1222, which is 6 April in the Gregorian calendar.

Nichiren was born in the village of Kominato (today part of the city of Kamogawa), Nagase District, Awa Province (within present-day Chiba Prefecture). Accounts of his lineage vary. Nichiren described himself as &quot;the son of a &quot;Sendara&quot; (&quot;Skt: chandala&quot;, despised outcast), &quot;a son born of the lowly people living on a rocky strand of the out-of-the-way sea,&quot; and &quot;the son of a sea-diver.&quot; In contrast, Hōnen, Shinran, Dōgen, and Eisai, the other founders of religious schools who predated Nichiren, were all born in the Kyoto region and came from noble or samurai backgrounds. Although his writings reflect a fierce pride of his lowly birth, followers after his death began to ascribe to him a more noble lineage, perhaps to attract more adherents. Some have claimed his father was a rōnin, a manorial functionary (&quot;shokan&quot;), or a political refugee.

Nichiren&#x27;s father was Mikuni-no-Tayu Shigetada, also known as Nukina Shigetada Jiro (died 1258); and his mother was Umegiku-nyo (died 1267). On his birth, his parents named him which has variously been translated into English as &quot;Splendid Sun&quot; and &quot;Virtuous Sun Boy&quot; among others. The exact site of Nichiren&#x27;s birth is believed to be currently submerged off the shore from present-day near a temple in Kominato that commemorates his birth.

=== Buddhist education ===
Between the years 1233 and 1253 Nichiren engaged in an intensive study of all of the ten schools of Buddhism prevalent in Japan at that time as well as the Chinese classics and secular literature. During these years, he became convinced of the preeminence of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; and in 1253 returned to the temple where he first studied to present his findings.

In a 1271 letter Nichiren outlined his rationale for deeply studying Buddhism:

At the age of 12 he began his Buddhist study at a temple of the Tendai school, . He was formally ordained at sixteen years old and took the Buddhist name , &quot;Renchō&quot; meaning &quot;Lotus Growth.&quot; He left Seichō-ji for Kamakura where he studied Pure Land Buddhism, a school that stressed salvation through nianfo (Japanese &quot;nembutsu&quot;) or the invocation of Amitābha (Japanese &quot;Amida&quot;), and then studied Zen which had been growing in popularity in both Kamakura and Kyoto. He next traveled to Mount Hiei, the center of Japanese Tendai Buddhism, where he scrutinized the school&#x27;s original doctrines and its subsequent incorporation of the theories and practices of Pure Land and Esoteric Buddhism. In the final stage of this twenty-year period he traveled to Mount Kōya, the center of Shingon esoteric Buddhism, and to Nara where he studied its six established schools, especially the Ritsu sect which emphasized strict monastic discipline.

=== Declaration of the Lotus Sutra ===
According to one of his letters, Nichiren returned to Seicho-ji Temple on 28 April 1253 to lecture on his twenty years of scholarship. What followed was his first public declaration of &quot;Nam(u) Myoho Renge Kyo&quot; atop Mount Kiyosumi that same day. This marked the start of his campaign to return Tendai to the exclusive reliance of the Lotus Sutra and his efforts to convert the entire Japanese nation to this belief. This declaration also marks the start of his efforts to make profound Buddhist theory practical and actionable so an ordinary person could manifest Buddhahood within his or her own lifetime in the midst of day-to-day realities.

At the same event, according to his own account and subsequent hagiography, he changed his name to &quot;Nichiren&quot;, an abbreviation of and . &quot;Nichi&quot; represents both the light of truth and the sun goddess Amaterasu, symbolizing Japan itself. &quot;Ren&quot; signifies the Lotus Sutra. Nichiren envisioned Japan as the country where the true teaching of Buddhism would be revived and the starting point for its worldwide spread.

At his lecture, it is construed, Nichiren vehemently attacked Honen, the founder of Pure Land Buddhism, and its practice of chanting the Nembutsu, &quot;Nam(u) Amida Butsu&quot;. It is likely he also denounced the core teachings of Seicho-ji which had incorporated non-exclusive Lotus Sutra teachings and practices. In so doing he earned the animosity of the local steward, Tojo Kagenobu, who attempted to have Nichiren killed. Modern scholarship suggests that events unfolded not in a single day but over a longer period of time and had social, and political dimensions.

Nichiren then developed a base of operation in Kamakura where he converted several Tendai priests, directly ordained others, and attracted lay disciples who were drawn mainly from the strata of the lower and middle samurai class. Their households provided Nichiren with economic support and became the core of Nichiren communities in several locations in the Kanto region of Japan.

=== First remonstration to the Kamakura government ===
Nichiren arrived in Kamakura in 1254. Between 1254 and 1260 half of the population had perished due to a tragic succession of calamities that included drought, earthquakes, epidemics, famine, fires, and storms. Nichiren sought scriptural references to explain the unfolding of natural disasters and then wrote a series of works which, based on the Buddhist theory of the non-duality of the human mind and the environment, attributed the sufferings to the weakened spiritual condition of people, thereby causing the &quot;Kami&quot; (protective forces or traces of the Buddha) to abandon the nation. The root cause of this, he argued, was the widespread decline of the Dharma due to the mass adoption of the Pure Land teachings.

The most renowned of these works, considered his first major treatise, was the , &quot;On Securing the Peace of the Land through the Propagation of True Buddhism.&quot; Nichiren submitted it to Hōjō Tokiyori, the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Kamakura shogunate, as a political move to effectuate radical reform. In it he argued the necessity for &quot;the Sovereign to recognize and accept the singly true and correct form of Buddhism (i.e., ) as the only way to achieve peace and prosperity for the land and its people and end their suffering (i.e., ).&quot;

Using a dialectic form well-established in China and Japan, the treatise is a 10-segment fictional dialogue between a Buddhist wise man, presumably Nichiren, and a visitor who together lament the tragedies that have beleaguered the nation. The wise man answers the guest&#x27;s questions and, after a heated exchange, gradually leads him to enthusiastically embrace the vision of a country grounded firmly on the ideals of the Lotus Sutra. In this writing Nichiren displays a skill in using analogy, anecdote, and detail to persuasively appeal to an individual&#x27;s unique psychology, experiences, and level of understanding.

The teacher builds his argument by quoting extensively from a set of Buddhist sutras and commentaries. In his future writings Nichiren continued to draw from the same sutras and commentaries, effectively forming Nichiren&#x27;s canon of sources out of the Buddhist library which he deemed supportive of the Lotus Sutra including the Konkomyo, Daijuku, Ninno, Yakushi, and Nirvana sutras. They share in common apocalyptic or nation-protecting teachings and prophecies.

The &quot;Risshō Ankoku Ron&quot; concludes with an urgent appeal to the ruler to cease all financial support for Buddhist schools promoting inferior teachings. Otherwise, Nichiren warns, as predicted by the sutras, the continued influence of inferior teachings would invite even more natural disasters as well as the outbreak of civil strife and foreign invasion.

Nichiren submitted his treatise on 16 July 1260 but it drew no official response. It did, however, prompt a severe backlash from the Buddhist priests of other schools. Nichiren was challenged to a religious debate with leading Kamakura prelates in which, by his account, they were swiftly dispatched. Their lay followers, however, attempted to kill him at his dwelling which forced him to flee Kamakura. His critics had influence with key governmental figures and spread slanderous rumors about him. One year after he submitted the &quot;Rissho Ankoku Ron&quot; the authorities had him arrested and exiled to the Izu peninsula.

Nichiren&#x27;s Izu exile lasted two years. In his extant writings from this time period, Nichiren began to strongly draw from chapters 10–22 of the Lotus Sutra, what Tanabe calls its &quot;third realm&quot; &quot;(daisan hōmon)&quot;. Nichiren began to emphasize the purpose of human existence as being the practice of the bodhisattva ideal in the real world which entails undertaking struggle and manifesting endurance. He suggested that he is a model of this behavior, a &quot;votary&quot; (&quot;gyōja&quot;) of the Lotus Sutra.

Upon being pardoned in 1263 Nichiren returned to Kamakura. In November 1264 he was ambushed and nearly killed at Komatsubara in Awa Province by a force led by Lord Tōjō Kagenobu. For the next few years he preached in provinces outside of Kamakura but returned in 1268. At this point the Mongols sent envoys to Japan demanding tribute and threatening invasion. Nichiren sent 11 letters to influential leaders reminding them about his predictions in the &quot;Rissho Ankoku Ron&quot;.

=== Attempt at execution ===

The threat and execution of Mongol invasion was the worst crisis in pre-modern Japanese history. In 1269 Mongol envoys again arrived to demand Japanese submission to their hegemony and the &quot;bakufu&quot; responded by mobilizing military defenses.

The role of Buddhism in &quot;nation-protection&quot; (&quot;chingo kokka&quot;) was long established in Japan at this time and the government galvanized prayers from Buddhist schools for this purpose. Nichiren and his followers, however, felt emboldened that the predictions he had made in 1260 of foreign invasion seemingly were being fulfilled and more people joined their movement. Daring a rash response from the &quot;bakufu&quot;, Nichiren vowed in letters to his followers that he was giving his life to actualize the Lotus Sutra. He accelerated his polemics against the non-Lotus teachings the government had been patronizing at the very time it was attempting to solidify national unity and resolve. In a series of letters to prominent leaders he directly provoked the major prelates of Kamakura temples that the Hojo family patronized, criticized the principles of Zen which was popular among the samurai class, critiqued the esoteric practices of Shingon just as the government was invoking them, and condemned the ideas underlying Risshū as it was enjoying a revival. His actions at that time have been described by modern scholars either as a high form of altruism or the ravings of a fanatic and madman.

His claims drew the ire of the influential religious figures of the time and their followers, especially the Shingon priest . In September 1271, after a fiery exchange of letters between the two, Nichiren was arrested by a band of soldiers and tried by , the deputy chief of the Hojo clan&#x27;s Board of Retainers. Nichiren considered this as his second remonstration to the government.

According to Nichiren&#x27;s own account, he was sentenced to exile but was brought to Tatsunukuchi beach in Shichirigahama for execution. At the final moment an astronomical phenomenon, &quot;a brilliant orb as bright as the moon,&quot; arced over the execution grounds, terrifying Nichiren&#x27;s executioners into inaction. Some scholars have proposed alternative narratives for this story.

Regardless of the account, Nichiren&#x27;s life was spared and he was exiled to Sado Island. The incident has become known as the &quot;Tatsunokuchi Persecution&quot; and was regarded by Nichiren as a death-and-resurrection turning point. In the Nichiren tradition this is called his moment of , translated as &quot;casting off the transient and revealing the true&quot; or &quot;outgrowing the provisional and revealing the essential.&quot;

=== Second banishment and exile ===
After the failed execution authorities carried out Nichiren&#x27;s original sentence of exile to Sado Island in the Sea of Japan. Upon arriving, he was dispatched to a small dilapidated temple located in a graveyard. Nichiren was accompanied by a few disciples and in the first winter they endured terrible cold, food deprivation, and threats from local inhabitants.
Nichiren scholars describe a clear shift in both tone and message in letters written before his Sado exile and those written during and after. Initially, Nichiren&#x27;s urgent concern was to rally his followers in Kamakura. The tactics of the &quot;bakufu&quot; suppression of the Nichiren community included exile, imprisonment, land confiscation, or ousting from clan membership. Apparently a majority of his disciples abandoned their faith and others questioned why they and Nichiren were facing such adversity in light of the Lotus Sutra&#x27;s promise of &quot;peace and security in the present life.&quot;

In response he began to identify himself with Sadāparibhūta, a key figure in the Lotus Sutra, who in the 20th chapter invited repeated persecution in his efforts to propagate the sutra. Such hardship, Nichiren argued, fulfilled and validated the Lotus Sutra. He also identified himself with the bodhisattva Visistacaritra to whom Shakyamuni entrusted the future propagation of the Lotus Sutra, seeing himself in the role of leading a vast outpouring of Bodhisattvas of the Earth who pledged to liberate the oppressed.

The numerous letters and minor treatises he wrote in Sado include what is considered his two most significant works, the and the . In the latter he stated that facing adversity should be regarded as a matter of course and that the resolve to carry on with the mission to propagate the sutra was for him more important than guarantees of protection: &quot;Let Heaven forsake me. Let ordeals confront me. I will not begrudge bodily life... . No matter what trials we may encounter, so long as we do not have a mind of doubt, I and my disciples will naturally achieve the Buddha realm.&quot; He concluded this work with the vow to be the &quot;pillar of Japan, the eyes of Japan, the great ship of Japan.&quot;

=== The Mandala Gohonzon===

At the end of the 1271–1272 winter Nichiren&#x27;s conditions had improved. He had attracted a small band of followers in Sado who provided him with support and disciples from the mainland began visiting him and providing supplies. In 1272 there was an attempted coup in Kamakura and Kyoto, seemingly fulfilling the prediction he had made in the &quot;Rissho Ankoku Ron&quot; of rebellion in the domain. At this point Nichiren was transferred to much better accommodations.

While on Sado island, Nichiren inscribed the first Mandala . Although there is evidence of a Gohonzon in embryonic form as far back as the days right before his exile, the first in full form is dated to 8 July 1273 and includes the inscription of &quot;Nichiren inscribes this for the first time.&quot;

His writings on Sado provide his rationale for a calligraphic mandala depicting the assembly at Eagle Peak which was to be used as an object of devotion or worship. By increasingly associating himself with Visistacaritra he implied a direct link to the original and universal Buddha. He read in the 16th (&quot;Life span&quot;) chapter of the Lotus Sutra a three-fold &quot;secret Dharma&quot; of the &quot;daimoku&quot;, the object of worship (&quot;honzon&quot;), and the ordination platform (&quot;kaidan&quot;). These became the means for people to directly access the Buddha&#x27;s enlightenment.

At the bottom of each mandala he wrote: &quot;This is the great mandala never before revealed in Jambudvipa during the more than 2,200 years since the Buddha&#x27;s nirvana.&quot; He inscribed many Mandala Gohonzon during the rest of his life. More than a hundred Mandala Gohonzon preserved today are attributed to Nichiren&#x27;s own hand.

=== Return to Kamakura ===
Nichiren was pardoned on 14 February 1274 and returned to Kamakura one month later on 26 March. Nichiren wrote that his innocence and the accuracy of his predictions caused the regent Hōjō Tokimune to intercede on his behalf. Scholars have suggested that some of his well-connected followers might have had influence on the government&#x27;s decision to release him.

On 8 April he was summoned by Hei no Saemon, who inquired about the timing of the next Mongol invasion. Nichiren predicted that it would occur within the year. He used the audience as yet another opportunity to remonstrate with the government. Claiming that reliance on prayers based on esoteric rituals would invite further calamity, he urged the &quot;bakufu&quot; to ground itself exclusively on the Lotus Sutra.

Deeply disappointed by the government&#x27;s refusal to heed his advice, Nichiren left Kamakura one month later, on 12 May, determined to become a solitary wayfarer. Five days later, however, on a visit to the residence of Lord Hakii Sanenaga of Mt. Minobu, he learned that followers in nearby regions had held steadfast during his exile. Despite severe weather and deprivation, Nichiren remained in Minobu for the rest of his career.

=== Retirement to Mount Minobu ===
During his self-imposed exile at Mount Minobu, a location 100 miles west of Kamakura, Nichiren led a widespread movement of followers in Kanto and Sado mainly through his prolific letter-writing. During the so-called &quot;Atsuhara affair&quot; of 1279 when governmental attacks were aimed at Nichiren&#x27;s followers rather than himself, Nichiren&#x27;s letters reveal an assertive and well-informed leader who provided detailed instructions through a sophisticated network of disciples serving as liaisons between Minobu and other affected areas in Japan. He also showed the ability to provide a compelling narrative of events that gave his followers a broad perspective of what was unfolding.

More than half of the extant letters of Nichiren were written during his years at Minobu. Some consisted of moving letters to followers expressing appreciation for their assistance, counseling on personal matters, and explaining his teachings in more understandable terms. Two of his works from this period, the and the constitute, along with his &quot;Risshō Ankoku Ron&quot; (&quot;On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land&quot;), &quot;Kaimoku Shō&quot; (&quot;The Opening of the Eyes&quot;), and &quot;Kanjin no Honzon Shō&quot; (&quot;The Object of Devotion for Observing the Mind&quot;), what is commonly regarded as his five major writings.

During his years at Minobu Nichiren intensified his attacks on that had been incorporated into the Japanese Tendai school. It becomes clear at this point that he understood that he was creating his own form of Lotus Buddhism.

Nichiren and his disciples completed the in 1281. In the 19th century this structure burned down to be replaced by a new structure completed in the second half of the Meiji era.

While at Minobu Nichiren also inscribed numerous Mandala Gohonzon for bestowal upon specific disciples and lay believers. Nichiren Shoshu believers claim that after the execution of the three Atsuhara farmers he inscribed the &quot;Dai Gohonzon&quot; on 12 October 1279, a Gohonzon specifically addressed to all humanity. This assertion has been disputed by other schools as historically and textually incorrect. It is enshrined currently at the &quot;Tahō Fuji Dai-Nichirenge-Zan Taiseki-ji&quot;, informally known as the &quot;Head Temple Taiseki-ji&quot; of the Nichiren Shōshū Order of Buddhism, located at the foot of Mount Fuji in Fujinomiya, Shizuoka. Several of these Mandala Gohonzon are prominently retained by the Nichiren-shū in Yamanashi Prefecture. Others survive today in the repositories of Nichiren Shōshū temples such as in Fujinomiya, Shizuoka, which has a particularly large collection of scrolls that is publicly aired once a year.

It is apparent that Nichiren took great care in deciding which of his disciples were eligible to receive a Gohonzon inscribed by him. In the case of a letter written to Lady Niiama he took great care to explain why he would not inscribe a Gohonzon despite a deep personal bond. Among the Gohonzon he inscribed were several that were quite large and perhaps intended for congregational use in chapels maintained by some lay followers.

=== Death ===

In 1282, after years of seclusion, Nichiren fell ill. His followers encouraged him to travel to the hot springs in Hitachi for their medicinal benefits. He was also encouraged by his disciples to travel there for the warmer weather, and to use the land offered by Hagiri Sanenaga for recuperation. En route, unable to travel further, he stopped at the home of a disciple in Ikegami, outside of present-day Tokyo, and died on 13 October 1282. According to legend, he died in the presence of fellow disciples after having spent several days lecturing from his sickbed on the Lotus Sutra, writing a final letter, and leaving instructions for the future of his movement after his death, namely the designation of the six senior disciples. His funeral and cremation took place the following day.

His disciples left Ikegami with Nichiren&#x27;s ashes on 21 October, reaching back to Minobu on 25 October.

* Nichiren Shu sects claims his tomb is sited, as per his request, at Kuon-ji on Mount Minobu where his ashes remain.
* Nichiren Shoshu asserts that Nikko Shonin later confiscated his cremated ashes along with other articles and brought them to Mount Fuji which, they say are now enshrined on the left side next to the Dai Gohonzon within the &quot;Hoando&quot; storage house.

== Teachings ==
Nichiren&#x27;s teachings developed over the course of his career and their evolution can be seen through the study of his writings as well as in the annotations he made in his personal copy of the Lotus Sutra, the so-called &quot;Chū-hokekyō&quot;.

Some scholars set a clear demarcation in his teachings at the time he arrived at Sado Island whereas others see a threefold division of thought: up to and through the Izu exile, from his return to Kamakura through the Sado Island exile, and during his years at Minobu.

According to Anesaki, Nichiren, upon his arrival at Minobu, quickly turned his attention to consolidating his teachings toward their perpetuation. The scope of his thinking was outlined in an essay , considered by Nikkō Shōnin as one of Nichiren&#x27;s ten major writings.

Anesaki also claims that later during his Minobu years, in lectures he is said to have transmitted to his disciples, Nichiren summarized the key ideas of his teachings in one paragraph: Buddhahood is eternal, all people can and should manifest it in their lives; Nichiren is the personage in the Lotus Sutra whose mission it is to enable people to realize their enlightenment; his followers who share his vow are the Bodhisattvas of the Earth. This requires a spiritual and moral unity among followers based on their inherent Buddhahood; Nichiren established the seeds of this community and his followers to come must extend it globally. Thus the enlightened individual, country, and world are different expressions of the ideal of the Buddha land; and the enlightened heart of the individual plays out its role with the world and cosmos as its stage. This is Nichiren&#x27;s vision of &quot;Kosen-rufu&quot;, a time when the teachings of the Lotus Sutra would be widely spread throughout the world.

Nichiren set a precedent for Buddhist social activism centuries before its emergence in other Buddhist schools. The uniqueness of his teachings was his attempt to move Buddhism from the theoretical to the actualizable. He held adamantly that his teachings would permit a nation to right itself and ultimately lead to world peace.

Some of his religious thinking was derived from the Tendai understanding of the Lotus Sutra, syncretic beliefs that were deeply rooted in the culture of his times, and new perspectives that were products of Kamakura Buddhism. Other ideas were completely original and unique to him.

=== Contributions based on Tendai or contemporary thought ===
Nichiren was a product of his times and some of his teachings were drawn from existing schools of thought or from emerging ideas in Kamakura Buddhism. Nichiren appropriated and expanded on these ideas.

==== Immanence ====
Nichiren stressed the concept of immanence, meaning that the Buddha&#x27;s pure land is to be found in this present world (&quot;shaba soku jakkōdo&quot;). Related concepts such as attaining enlightenment in one&#x27;s current form (&quot;sokushin jōbutsu&quot;) and the belief that enlightenment is not attained but is originally existing within all people (&quot;hongaku&quot;) had been introduced by Kūkai and Saicho several centuries earlier. These concepts were based on Chih-i&#x27;s cosmology of the unity and interconnectedness of the universe called Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life (&quot;ichinen sanzen&quot;).

Nichiren advanced these concepts by declaring that they were actualizable rather than theoretical. Cause and effect were simultaneous instead of linear. Contemplation of one&#x27;s mind (&quot;kanjin&quot;) took place within the singular belief in and commitment to the Lotus Sutra. According to Nichiren these phenomena manifest when a person chants the title of the Lotus Sutra (&quot;date&quot;) and shares its validity with others, even at the cost of one&#x27;s life if need be.

Nichiren constructed a triad relationship between faith, practice, and study. Faith meant embracing his new paradigm of the Lotus Sutra. It was something that needed to be continually deepened. &quot;To accept (&quot;ju&quot;) [faith in the sutra] is easy,&quot; he explained to a follower, &quot;to uphold it (&quot;ji&quot;) is difficult. But the realization of Buddhahood lies in upholding [faith].&quot; This could only be manifested by the practice of chanting the &quot;daimoku&quot; as well as teaching others to do the same, and study.

Consequently, Nichiren consistently and vehemently objected to the perspective of the Pure Land school that stressed an other-worldly aspiration to some pure land. Behind his assertion is the concept of the nonduality of the subjective realm (the individual) and the objective realm (the land that the individual inhabits) which indicates that when the individual taps buddhahood, his or her present world becomes peaceful and harmonious. For Nichiren the widespread propagation of the Lotus Sutra and consequent world peace (&quot;kosen-rufu&quot;) was achievable and inevitable and tasked his future followers with a mandate to accomplish it.

==== The Latter Day of the Law ====
The Kamakura period of 13th century Japan was characterized by a sense of foreboding. Nichiren, as well as the others of this time, believed that they had entered the Latter Day of the Law (&quot;Mappō&quot;), the time which Shakyamuni predicted his teachings would lose their efficacy. Indeed, Japan had entered an era of extreme natural disasters, internal strife and political conflict.

Although Nichiren attributed the turmoils and disasters in society to the widespread practice of what he deemed inferior Buddhist teachings that were under government sponsorship, he was enthusiastically upbeat about the portent of the age. He asserted, in contrast to other Mahayana schools, this was the best possible moment to be alive, the era in which the Lotus Sutra was to spread, and the time in which the Bodhisattvas of the Earth would appear to propagate it. &quot;It is better to be a leper who chants Nam(u)-myōhō-renge-kyō than be a chief abbot of the Tendai school.&quot;
==== Debate and polemics ====
The tradition of conducting open and sustained debate to clarify matters of fundamental Buddhist principles has deep-seated roots in Tibet, China, and Korea. This tradition was also quite pronounced in Japan.

In addition to formalized religious debates, the Kamakura period was marked by flourishing and competitive oral religious discourse. Temples began to compete for the patronage of the wealthy and powerful through oratorical sermonizing and temple lecturers (&quot;kōshi&quot;) faced pressure to attract crowds. Sermonizing spread from within the confines of temples to homes and the streets as wandering mendicants (&quot;shidōso&quot;, &quot;hijiri&quot;, or &quot;inja&quot;) preached to both the educated and illiterate in exchange for alms. In order to teach principles of faith preachers incorporated colorful storytelling, music, vaudeville, and drama—which later evolved into Noh.

A predominant topic of debate in Kamakura Buddhism was the concept of rebuking &quot;slander of the Dharma.&quot; The Lotus Sutra itself strongly warns about slander of the Dharma. Hōnen, in turn, employed harsh polemics instructing people to , , , and the Lotus Sutra and other non-Pure Land teachings. His ideas were vociferously attacked by many including Nichiren.

Nichiren, however, elevated countering slander of the Dharma into a pillar of Buddhist practice. In fact, far more of his extant writings deal with the clarification of what constitutes the essence of Buddhist teachings than expositions of how to meditate.

At age 32, Nichiren began a career of denouncing other Mahayana Buddhist schools of his time and declaring what he asserted was the correct teaching, the Universal Dharma (&quot;Nam(u)-Myōhō-Renge-Kyō&quot;), and chanting its words as the only path for both personal and social salvation. The first target of his polemics was Pure Land Buddhism which had begun to gain ascendancy among the leaders and populace and even had established itself within the Tendai school. Nichiren&#x27;s detailed rationale is most famously articulated in his : &quot;Treatise On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land,&quot; his first major treatise and the first of his three remonstrations with the &quot;bakufu&quot; authorities.

Although his times were harsh and permeated by &quot;bakufu&quot; culture, Nichiren always chose the power of language over bearing arms or resorting to violence. He didn&#x27;t mince his words and was relentless to pursue dialogue whether in the form of debate, conversations, or correspondence. His spirit of engaging in discourse is captured in his statement, &quot;Whatever obstacles I may encounter, as long as men [persons] of wisdom do not prove my teachings to be false, I will never yield.&quot;

==== &quot;Single Practice&quot; Buddhism ====
Hōnen introduced the concept of &quot;single practice&quot; Buddhism. Basing himself on the writings of the Chinese Buddhist Shandao, he advocated the singular practice of Nianfo, the recitation of the Buddha Amida&#x27;s name. This practice was revolutionary because it was accessible to all and minimalized the monopolistic role of the entire monastic establishment.

Nichiren appropriated the structure of a universally accessible single practice but substituted the Nianfo with the daimoku of &quot;Nam(u)-myōhō-renge-kyō&quot;. This constituted renouncing the principle of aspiring to a Pure Land after death and asserting instead the Lotus perspective of attaining Buddhahood in one&#x27;s present form in this lifetime.

==== Protective forces ====
Japan had a long-established system of folk beliefs that existed outside of and parallel to the schools of the Buddhist establishment. Many of these beliefs had an influence on the various religious schools which, in turn, influenced each other, a phenomenon known as syncretism. Among these beliefs were the existence of &quot;kami&quot;, indigenous gods and goddesses or protective forces, that influenced human and natural occurrences in a holistic universe. Some beliefs ascribed &quot;kami&quot; to traces of the Buddha. The belief in &quot;kami&quot; was deeply embedded in the episteme of the time. Human agency through prayers and rituals could summon forth &quot;kami&quot; who would engage in nation-protection (&quot;chingo kokka&quot;).

According to some of his accounts, Nichiren undertook his study of Buddhism to largely understand why the &quot;kami&quot; had seemingly abandoned Japan, as witnessed by the decline of the imperial court. Because the court and the people had turned to teachings that had weakened their minds and resolve, he came to conclude, both people of wisdom and the protective forces had abandoned the nation.

By extension, he argued, through proper prayer and action his troubled society would transform into an ideal world in which peace and wisdom prevail and &quot;the wind will not thrash the branches nor the rain fall hard enough to break clods.&quot;

=== Unique teachings ===
From Nichiren&#x27;s corpus appear several lines of unique Buddhist thought.

==== &quot;The Five Guides of Propagation&quot; ==== 
Developed during his Izu exile, the Five Guides (&quot;gogi&quot;) are five criteria through which Buddhist teachings can be evaluated and ranked. They are the quality of the teaching (kyō), the innate human capacity (&quot;ki&quot;) of the people, the time (&quot;ji&quot;), the characteristic of the land or country (&quot;koku&quot;), and the sequence of dharma propagation (&quot;kyōhō rufu no zengo&quot;). From these five interrelated perspectives Nichiren declared his interpretation of the Lotus Sutra as the supreme teaching.

==== The Four Denunciations ====
Throughout his career Nichiren harshly denounced Buddhist practices other than his own as well as the existing social and political system. The tactic he adopted was &quot;shakubuku,&quot; conversion, in which he shocked his adversaries with his denunciations while attracting followers through his outward display of supreme confidence. Modern detractors criticize his exclusivist single-truth perspective as intolerant. Apologists argue his arguments should be understood in the context of his samurai society and not through post-modern lenses such as tolerance. Both of them may be regarded as having seized an aspect of the truth, namely that Nichiren, rather like Dogen, was not less brilliantly original for being a rigid dogmatist in doctrine.

As his career advanced, Nichiren&#x27;s vehement polemics against Pure Land teachings came to include sharp criticisms of the Shingon, Zen, and Ritsu schools of Buddhism. Collectively his criticisms have become known as &quot;the Four Denunciations.&quot; Later in his career he critiqued the Japanese Tendai school for its appropriation of Shingon elements. Reliance on Shingon rituals, he claimed, was magic and would decay the nation. He held that Zen was devilish in its belief that attaining enlightenment was possible without relying on the Buddha&#x27;s words; Ritsu was thievery because it hid behind token deeds such as public works. In modern parlance the Four Denunciations rebuked thinking that demoralized and disengaged people by encouraging resignation and escapism.

==== The doctrine of the Three Great Secret Laws ====
Nichiren deemed the world to be in a degenerative age and believed that people required a simple and effective means to rediscover the core of Buddhism and thereby restore their spirits and times. He described his Three Great Secret Laws (&quot;Sandai hiho&quot;) as this very means.

In a writing entitled &quot;Sandai Hiho Sho&quot;, or &quot;On the Transmission of the Three Great Secret Laws&quot;, Nichiren delineated three teachings in the heart of the 16th chapter of the Lotus Sutra which are secret because he claimed he received them as the leader of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth through a silent transmission from Shakyamuni. They are the invocation (&quot;daimoku&quot;), the object of worship (&quot;honzon&quot;), and the platform of ordination or place of worship (&quot;kaidan&quot;).

The &quot;daimoku&quot;, the rhythmic chanting of Nam(u)-myōhō-renge-kyō is the means to discover that one&#x27;s own life, the lives of others, and the environment is the essence of the Buddha of absolute freedom. The chanting is to be done while contemplating the &quot;honzon&quot;. At the age of 51, Nichiren inscribed his own Mandala Gohonzon, the object of veneration or worship in his Buddhism, &quot;never before known,&quot; as he described it. The Gohonzon is a calligraphic representation of the cosmos and chanting &quot;daimoku&quot; to it is Nichiren&#x27;s method of meditation to experience the truth of Buddhism. He believed this practice was efficacious, simple to perform, and suited to the capacity of the people and the time.

Nichiren describes the first two secret laws in numerous other writings but the reference to the platform of ordination appears only in the &quot;Sandai Hiho Sho&quot;, a work whose authenticity has been questioned by some scholars. Nichiren apparently left the fulfillment of this secret Dharma to his successors and its interpretation has been a matter of heated debate. Some state that it refers to the construction of a physical national ordination platform sanctioned by the emperor; others contend that the ordination platform is the community of believers (&quot;sangha&quot;) or, simply, the place where practitioners of the Lotus Sutra live and make collective efforts to realize the ideal of establishing the true Dharma in order to establish peace to the land (&quot;rissho ankoku&quot;). The latter conception entails a robust interplay between religion and secular life and an egalitarian structure in which people are dedicated to perfecting an ideal society.

According to Nichiren, practicing the Three Secret Laws results in the &quot;Three Proofs&quot; which verify their validity. The first proof is &quot;documentary,&quot; whether the religion&#x27;s fundamental texts, here the writings of Nichiren, make a lucid case for the eminence of the religion. &quot;Theoretical proof&quot; is an intellectual standard of whether a religion&#x27;s teachings reasonably clarify the mysteries of life and death. &quot;Actual proof,&quot; deemed the most important by Nichiren, demonstrates the validity of the teaching through the actual improvements achieved by practitioners in their daily lives.

==== Changing karma to mission ====
Nichiren was deeply aware of the karmic struggles his followers faced in their day-to-day existence and assured them that they could &quot;cross the sea of suffering&quot; (&quot;Shiji Shiro-dono gosho&quot;). Through prevailing over such challenges, he taught, they would establish a sense of inner freedom, peace of mind, and understanding of the Dharma that persisted independent of the ups and downs of sentient existence. He accepted prevailing Buddhist notions about karma that taught that a person&#x27;s current conditions were the cumulative effect of past thoughts, words, and actions. He showed little concern, however, for attributing current circumstances to supposed past deeds. Rather, he viewed karma through the lens of the teachings of the Lotus Sutra which could enable all people to become Buddhas, even the ignorant and evil people of the Latter Day of the Law.

When confronting karmic situations, the act of chanting Nam(u)-myoho-renge-kyo would open the wisdom of the Buddha, transforming karma into mission and a creative and joy-filled way of life. Beyond the sphere of a single individual&#x27;s life, the process would awaken a person&#x27;s concern for the broader society and sense of social responsibility.

Nichiren introduced the term to describe himself. The Lotus Sutra itself speaks of the great trials that will be faced by individuals who base themselves on its teachings and attempt to spread it. Nichiren claims he read the sutra &quot;bodily&quot; (&quot;shikidoku&quot;), voluntarily inviting the entailing hardships it predicts rather than just reciting or meditating on its words.

Through challenging these persecutions Nichiren claimed to have discovered his personal mission and felt great joy even when experiencing the harshness of exile. His sufferings became, in his thinking, redemptive opportunities to change his karma and give his life transcendent meaning.

In enduring severe persecutions Nichiren claimed that the negative karma he had accumulated from the past could be eradicated quickly in his current life. He was an active agent in this process, not a victim. He even expressed appreciation to his tormentors for giving him the opportunity to serve as an envoy of the Buddha.
In letters to some of his followers Nichiren extended the concept of meeting persecution for the sake of propagating the Dharma to experiencing tribulations in life such as problems with family discord or illness. He encouraged these followers to take ownership of such life events, view them as opportunities to repay karmic debts and mitigate them in shorter periods of time than would otherwise be the case. Naturally, he did not use language redolent of twentieth century concepts within, e.g., psychotherapy, hyperliberalism or the Human Potential Movement, but his insistence on personal responsibility can be reimagined in such terms.

Nichiren reached a state of conviction that offered a new perspective on karma. He express that his resolve to carry out his mission was paramount in importance and that the Lotus Sutra&#x27;s promise of a peaceful and secure existence meant finding joy and validation in the process of overcoming karma. According to Stone, in confronting karma Nichiren &quot;demonstrated an attitude that wastes little energy in railing against it but unflinchingly embraces it, interpreting it in whatever way appears meaningful at the moment so as to use that suffering for one&#x27;s own development and to offer it on behalf of others.&quot;

==== The great vow to achieve Kosen-rufu ====
Nichiren&#x27;s teachings are replete with vows he makes for himself and asks his followers to share as well. Some are personal in nature such as frequent admonitions for people to transform their inner lives. &quot;You must quickly reform the tenets you hold in your heart,&quot; he stated in his treatise &quot;Rissho Ankoku Ron&quot;. He urged his followers to attain &quot;treasures of the heart&quot; and to reflect on their behavior as human beings. These vows are &quot;this-worldly&quot; rather than theoretical and are matched with an easily accessible practice.

Nichiren also made a &quot;great vow&quot; of a political dimension. He and his followers to come would create the conditions that lead to a just nation and world which the Lotus Sutra describes as &quot;Kosen-rufu&quot;. In earlier Japanese Buddhism the concept of &quot;nation&quot; was equated with &quot;Tennō&quot; (天皇), or imperial rule and &quot;peace of the land&quot; was associated with the stability of the regime. Nichiren&#x27;s teachings, however, fully embraced a newly emerging viewpoint in medieval Japan that &quot;nation&quot; referred to the land and the people. Nichiren was unique among his contemporaries in charging the actual government in power, in this case the &quot;bakufu&quot; rather than the throne, with the peace of the land as well as the thriving of the Dharma. In his teachings based on the Lotus Sutra, all human beings are equal, whether the nation&#x27;s sovereign or an unknown commoner. Enlightenment is not restricted to an individual&#x27;s inner life but is actualized by efforts toward the transformation of the land and the realization of an ideal society.

This entails an urgent mandate. Nichiren links the great vow of personages in the Lotus Sutra to raise all people to the consciousness of the Buddha, to his own single-minded struggles to teach the Law despite the great persecutions he, Nichiren himself, encountered, to his injunction to future disciples to create the Buddha land in the &quot;saha&quot; world over the course of the myriad years to follow.

== Nichiren and his followers ==

Nichiren was a charismatic leader who attracted many followers during both his missionary trips and his exiles. Most of these followers were warriors and feudal lords. He maintained to his women followers that they were equally able to attain enlightenment. He set a high standard of leadership and, in his writings, shared his rationale and strategies with them, openly urging them to share his conviction and struggles.

He left the fulfillment of the &quot;kaidan&quot;, the third of his Three Secret Dharmas, to his disciples. His many extant letters demonstrate the scope and breadth of his relationship with them and his expectations for them. They recognized and trusted his charismatic leadership and his understanding of Buddhism. Many sought his guidance to overcome personal problems. Many were actively involved with supporting him financially and protecting his community of followers. Several of disciples were praised by him for sharing in his privations and a few lost their lives in these situations. Although over the centuries the movement he established was fraught with divisions, his followers sustained his teachings and example and various times gained considerable influence. Today his followers are found in influential lay movements as well as traditional Nichiren schools.

The relationship between Nichiren and his disciples has been called &quot;shitei funi&quot;, the oneness of mentor and disciple. Although the functions of the mentor and disciple may vary, they share the same goals and the same responsibility. Nichiren claimed the precedent for &quot;shitei funi&quot; is a core theme of the Lotus Sutra, especially in chapters 21 and 22 where the Buddha entrusts the future propagation of the sutra to the gathered bodhisattvas.

== After Nichiren&#x27;s death ==
After Nichiren&#x27;s death, his teachings were interpreted in different ways. As a result, Nichiren Buddhism encompasses several major branches and schools, each with its own doctrine and set of interpretations of Nichiren&#x27;s teachings.

== Writings ==

Many of Nichiren&#x27;s writings still exist in his original handwriting, some as complete works and some as fragments. Other documents survive as copies made by his immediate disciples. Nichiren&#x27;s existing works number over 700 manuscripts in total, including transcriptions of orally delivered lectures, letters of remonstration and illustrations.

Scholars have divided the writings attributed to Nichiren into three categories: those whose authenticity are universally accepted, those generally designated as written by someone else after his death, and a third category in which the veracity of works is still being debated.

In addition to treatises written in formal , Nichiren also wrote expositories and letters to followers in mixed kanji-kana vernacular as well as letters in simplified kana for believers such as children who could not read the more formal styles. Some of Nichiren&#x27;s &quot;kanbun&quot; works, especially the &quot;Risshō Ankoku Ron&quot;, are considered exemplary of the &quot;kanbun&quot; style, while many of his letters show unusual empathy and understanding for the downtrodden of his day.

=== Selected important writings ===
Among his &quot;kanbun&quot; treatises, five are generally accepted by Nichiren schools as his major works:

* &quot;On Securing the Peace of the Land through the Propagation of True Buddhism&quot; (&quot;Rissho Ankoku Ron&quot;) — written between 1258 and 1260.
* &quot;The Opening of the Eyes&quot; (&quot;Kaimoku-sho&quot;) — written in 1272.
* &quot;The True Object of Worship&quot; (&quot;Kanjin-no Honzon-sho&quot;) — written in 1273.
* &quot;The Selection of the Time&quot; (&quot;Senji-sho&quot;) — written in 1275.
* &quot;On Repaying Debts of Gratitude&quot; (&quot;Ho&#x27;on-sho&quot;) — written in 1276.

Nichiren Shōshū adds an additional five writings to comprise a set of ten major writings. Other Nichiren sects dispute these selections as being either of secondary importance or as apocryphal:

* &quot;On Chanting the Daimoku of the Lotus Sutra&quot; (&quot;Sho-hokke Daimoku-sho&quot;) — Written in 1260.
* &quot;On Taking the Essence of the Lotus Sutra&quot; (&quot;Hokke Shuyo-sho&quot;) — written in 1274.
* &quot;On the Four Stages of Faith and the Five Stages of Practice&quot; (&quot;Shishin Gohon-sho&quot;) — written in 1277.
* &quot;Letter to Shimoyama&quot; (&quot;Shimoyama Gosho-soku&quot;) — written in 1277.
* &quot;Questions and Answers on the Object of Worship&quot; (&quot;Honzon Mondo-sho&quot;) — written in 1278.

=== Personal letters to followers ===
Among the collection of his extant writings are numerous letters to his follows in the form of thank you notes, messages of condolence, responses to questions, and spiritual counseling for trying moments in his followers&#x27; lives. Collectively these letters demonstrate that Nichiren was a master of providing both comfort and challenge befitting the unique personalities and situations of each individual.

Many of these letters use tales drawn from Indian, Chinese, and Japanese traditions as well as historical anecdotes and stories from the Buddhist canon. Nichiren incorporated several hundred of these anecdotes and took liberty to freely embellish some of them; a few of the stories he provided do not appear in other collections and could be original.

Another category of his letters follow the genres of Japanese &quot;zuihitsu&quot;, lyrical and loosely organized essays that combine personal reflection and poetic language, or personal diaries (&quot;nikki&quot;) Nichiren was a master of this genre and these colloquial works reveal his highly personal and charismatic method of proselytization as well as his deep caring for his followers.

Nichiren used his letters as a means to inspire key supporters. About one hundred followers are identified as recipients and several received between 5 and 20 of them. The recipients tended to be of the warrior class and only scattered references appear about his lower status followers, many of whom were illiterate. The series of letters he wrote his followers during the &quot;Atsuhara affair&quot; of 1279 provide a case study of how he used personal written communications to direct a response to the government&#x27;s actions and to keep his followers steadfast during the ordeal.

=== Writings to women ===
Against a backdrop of earlier Buddhist teachings that deny the possibility of enlightenment to women or reserve that possibility for life after death, Nichiren is highly sympathetic to women. Based on various passages from the Lotus Sutra, Nichiren asserts that &quot;Other sutras are written for men only. This sutra is for everyone.&quot;

Ninety of his extant letters, nearly a fifth of the total, were addressed to female correspondents. Nichiren Shu published separate volumes of those writings.

In these letters Nichiren plays particular attention to the instantaneous attainment of enlightenment of the Dragon King&#x27;s daughter in the &quot;Devadatta&quot; (Twelfth) chapter of the Lotus Sutra and displays deep concern for the fears and worries of his female disciples.

In many of his letters to female believers he often expressed compliments for their in-depth questions about Buddhism while encouraging them in their efforts to attain enlightenment in this lifetime.

==Sword associated with Nichiren==

The &quot;&quot;Juzumaru-Tsunetsugu&quot; &quot; is a katana sword associated with Nichiren. The sword was given to Nichiren by lay follower Nanbu Sanenaga for protection. Nichiren did not use the sword, rather held it as a symbol for the &quot;destroying of iniquity and establishing righteousness&quot; and placed a juzu rosary on its hilt, thus giving the sword its accorded name.

The 13th century swordsmith Aoe Tsunetsugu is credited with creating the Juzumaru-Tsunetsugu. However, scholarship research shows the Juzumaru shows variations and differences in its workmanship compared to other authenticated Aoe Tsunetsugu swords. For example, the artisan signature on the Juzumaru is on the other side of where Aoe would have typically signed his swords. Debate on its origin of craftsmanship is contested regarding the sword.

<text>Nichiren Buddhism (), also known as Hokkeshū (, meaning &quot;Lotus Sect&quot;), is a branch of Mahayana Buddhism based on the teachings of the 13th-century Japanese Buddhist priest Nichiren (1222–1282) and is one of the Kamakura period schools. Its teachings derive from some 300–400 extant letters and treatises either authored by or attributed to Nichiren.

Nichiren Buddhism generally sources its basic doctrine from the Lotus Sutra claiming that all sentient beings possess an internal Buddha-nature capable of attaining Buddhahood in the current life. There are three essential aspects to Nichiren Buddhism:

# The faith in Nichiren&#x27;s Gohonzon 
# The chanting of &quot;Nam Myoho Renge Kyo&quot; with varying recitations of the Lotus Sutra 
# The study of Nichiren&#x27;s scriptural writings, called &quot;Gosho&quot;

After his death, Nichiren left to both his senior disciples and lay followers the mandate to widely propagate the &quot;Gohonzon&quot; and chanting the &quot;Daimoku&quot; in order to secure the peace and prosperity of society.

Traditionalist Nichiren Buddhist temple groups are commonly associated with Nichiren Shōshū and various Nichiren-shū schools. In addition, modern lay organizations not affiliated with temples such as Soka Gakkai, Kenshokai, Shoshinkai, Risshō Kōsei Kai, and Honmon Butsuryū-shū also exist while some Japanese new religions are Nichiren-inspired lay groups.

The Soka Gakkai International is often called &quot;the most prominent Japanese &#x27;export&#x27; religion to draw significant numbers of non-Japanese converts&quot;, by which Nichiren Buddhism has spread throughout the world.

Nichiren upheld the belief that the Lotus Sutra alone contains the highest degree of Buddhist teachings and proposed a classification system that ranks the quality of religions and various Nichiren schools can be either accommodating or vigorously opposed to any other forms of Buddhism or religious beliefs. Various followers debate Nichiren status, as a Bodhisattva, a mortal saint, or an &quot;Original Buddha&quot; of the third age of Buddhism. Nichiren Buddhism is practiced in many countries. The largest groups are Soka Gakkai International, Nichiren Shu, and Nichiren Shōshū.

==Basic teachings==
Nichiren&#x27;s teachings encompass a significant number of concepts. Briefly, the basic practice of Nichiren Buddhism is chanting the invocation &quot;Nam-myoho-renge-kyo&quot; to an object called the &quot;Gohonzon&quot;. Embracing &quot;Nam-myoho-renge-kyo&quot; entails both chanting and having the mind of faith. (&quot;shinjin&quot;). It has three pillars namely: faith, practice and study. Both the invocation and the Gohonzon, as taught by Nichiren, embody the title and essence of the Lotus Sutra, which he taught as the only valid scripture for the Latter Day of the Law, as well as the life state of Buddhahood inherent in all life.

Nichiren considered that in the Latter Day of the Law – a time of human strife and confusion, when Buddhism would be in decline – Buddhism had to be more than the theoretical or meditative practice it had become, but was meant to be practiced &quot;with the body&quot;, that is, in one&#x27;s actions and the consequent results that are manifested. More important than the formality of ritual, he claimed, was the substance of the practitioner&#x27;s life in which the spiritual and material aspects are interrelated. He considered conditions in the world to be a reflection of the conditions of the inner lives of people; the premise of his first major remonstrance, Rissho Ankoku Ron (Establishing The Correct Teaching for the Peace of The Land), is that if a nation abandons heretical forms of Buddhism and adopts faith in the Lotus Sutra, the nation will know peace and security. He considered his disciples the &quot;Bodhisattvas of the Earth&quot; who appeared in the Lotus Sutra with the vow to spread the correct teaching and thereby establish a peaceful and just society. For Nichiren, enlightenment is not limited to one&#x27;s inner life, but is &quot;something that called for actualization in endeavors toward the transformation of the land, toward the realization of an ideal society.&quot;

The specific task to be pursued by Nichiren&#x27;s disciples was the widespread propagation of his teachings (the invocation and the &quot;Gohonzon&quot;) in a way that would effect actual change in the world&#x27;s societies so that the sanctuary, or seat, of Buddhism could be built. Nichiren saw this sanctuary as a specific seat of his Buddhism, but there is thought that he also meant it in a more general sense, that is, wherever his Buddhism would be practiced. This sanctuary, along with the invocation and &quot;Gohonzon&quot;, comprise &quot;the three great secret laws (or dharmas)&quot; found in the Lotus Sutra.

==Nichiren==
===Nichiren and his time===

Nichiren Buddhism originated in 13th-century feudal Japan. It is one of six new forms of &quot;Shin Bukkyo&quot; (English: &quot;New Buddhism&quot;) of &quot;Kamakura Buddhism.&quot; The arrival of these new schools was a response to the social and political upheaval in Japan during this time as power passed from the nobility to a shogunate military dictatorship led by the Minamoto clan and later to the Hōjō clan. A prevailing pessimism existed associated with the perceived arrival of the Age of the Latter Day of the Law. The era was marked by an intertwining relationship between Buddhist schools and the state which included clerical corruption.

By Nichiren&#x27;s time the Lotus Sūtra was firmly established in Japan. From the ninth century, Japanese rulers decreed that the Lotus Sūtra be recited in temples for its &quot;nation-saving&quot; qualities. It was the most frequently read and recited sutra by the literate lay class and its message was disseminated widely through art, folk tales, music, and theater. It was commonly held that it had powers to bestow spiritual and worldly benefits to individuals. However, even Mount Hiei, the seat of Tiantai Lotus Sutra devotion, had come to adopt an eclectic assortment of esoteric rituals and Pure Land practices as &quot;expedient means&quot; to understand the sutra itself.

===Development during Nichiren&#x27;s life===
Nichiren developed his thinking in this midst of confusing Lotus Sutra practices and a competing array of other &quot;Old Buddhism&quot; and &quot;New Buddhism&quot; schools. The biographical development of his thinking is sourced almost entirely from his extant writings as there is no documentation about him in the public records of his times. Modern scholarship on Nichiren&#x27;s life tries to provide sophisticated textual and sociohistorical analyses to cull longstanding myths about Nichiren that accrued over time from what is actually concretized.

It is clear that from an early point in his studies Nichiren came to focus on the Lotus Sutra as the culmination and central message of Shakyamuni. As his life unfolded he engaged in a &quot;circular hermeneutic&quot; in which the interplay of the Lotus Sutra text and his personal experiences verified and enriched each other in his mind. As a result, there are significant turning points as his teachings reach full maturity. Scholar Yoshirō Tamura categorizes the development of Nichiren&#x27;s thinking into three periods:
* An early period extending up to Nichiren&#x27;s submission of the &quot;&quot;Risshō Ankoku Ron&quot; (&quot;Establishment of the Legitimate Teaching for the Protection of the Country&quot;&quot;) to Hōjō Tokiyori in 1260;
* A middle period bookmarked by his first exile (to Izu Peninsula, 1261) and his release from his second exile (to Sado Island, 1273);
* A final period (1274–1282) in which Nichiren lived in Mount Minobu directing his movement from afar.

==== Early stage: From initial studies to 1260 ====
For more than 20 years Nichiren examined Buddhist texts and commentaries at Mount Hiei&#x27;s Enryaku-ji temple and other major centers of Buddhist study in Japan. In later writings he claimed he was motivated by four primary questions: (1) What were the essentials of the competing Buddhist sects so they could be ranked according to their merits and flaws? (2) Which of the many Buddhist scriptures that had reached Japan represented the essence of Shakyamuni&#x27;s teaching? (3) How could he be assured of the certainty of his own enlightenment? (4) Why was the Imperial house defeated by the Kamakura regime in 1221 despite the prayers and rituals of Tendai and Shingon priests? He eventually concluded that the highest teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha ( – ) were to be found in the Lotus Sutra. Throughout his career Nichiren carried his personal copy of the Lotus Sutra which he continually annotated. The mantra he expounded on 28 April 1253, known as the &quot;Daimoku&quot; or &quot;Odaimoku&quot;, Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō, expresses his devotion to the Lotus Sutra.

From this early stage of his career, Nichiren started to engage in fierce polemics criticizing the teachings of Buddhism taught by the other sects of his day, a practice that continued and expanded throughout his life. Although Nichiren accepted the Tendai theoretical constructs of &quot;original enlightenment&quot; (&quot;hongaku shisō&quot;) and &quot;attaining Buddhahood in one&#x27;s present form&quot; (&quot;sokushin jobutsu&quot;) he drew a distinction, insisting both concepts should be seen as practical and realizable amidst the concrete realities of daily life. He took issue with other Buddhist schools of his time that stressed transcendence over immanence. Nichiren&#x27;s emphasis on &quot;self-power&quot; (Jpn. &quot;ji-riki&quot;) led him to harshly criticize Honen and his Pure Land Buddhism school because of its exclusive reliance on Amida Buddha for salvation which resulted in &quot;other-dependence.&quot; (Jpn. &quot;ta-riki&quot;) In addition to his critique of Pure Land Buddhism, he later expanded his polemics to criticisms of the Zen, Shingon, and Ritsu sects. These four critiques were later collectively referred to as his &quot;four dictums.&quot; Later in his writings, Nichiren referred to his early exegeses of the Pure Land teachings as just the starting point for his polemics against the esoteric teachings, which he had deemed as a far more significant matter of concern. Adding to his criticisms of esoteric Shingon, Nichiren wrote detailed condemnations about the Tendai school which had abandoned its Lotus Sutra-exclusiveness and incorporated esoteric doctrines and rituals as well as faith in the soteriological power of Amida Buddha.

The target of his tactics expanded during the early part of his career. Between 1253 and 1259 he proselytized and converted individuals, mainly attracting mid- to lower-ranking samurai and local landholders and debated resident priests in Pure Land temples. In 1260, however, he attempted to directly reform society as a whole by submitting a treatise entitled &quot;&quot;Risshō Ankoku Ron&quot; (&quot;Establishment of the Legitimate Teaching for the Protection of the Country&quot;&quot;) to Hōjō Tokiyori, the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the nation.

In it he cites passages from the Ninnō, Yakushi, Daijuku, and Konkōmyō sutras. Drawing on Tendai thinking about the non duality of person and land, Nichiren argued that the truth and efficacy of the people&#x27;s religious practice will be expressed in the outer conditions of their land and society. He thereby associated the natural disasters of his age with the nation&#x27;s attachment to inferior teachings, predicted foreign invasion and internal rebellion, and called for the return to legitimate dharma to protect the country. Although the role of Buddhism in &quot;nation-protection&quot; (&quot;chingo kokka&quot;) was well-established in Japan at this time, in this thesis Nichiren explicitly held the leadership of the country directly responsible for the safety of the land.

==== Middle stage: 1261–1273 ====
During the middle stage of his career, in refuting other religious schools publicly and vociferously, Nichiren provoked the ire of the country&#x27;s rulers and of the priests of the sects he criticized. As a result, he was subjected to persecution which included two assassination attempts, an attempted beheading and two exiles. His first exile, to Izu Peninsula (1261–1263), convinced Nichiren that he was &quot;bodily reading the Lotus Sutra (&quot;Jpn. Hokke shikidoku&quot;),&quot; fulfilling the predictions on the 13th chapter (&quot;Fortitude&quot;) that votaries would be persecuted by ignorant lay people, influential priests, and their friends in high places.

Nichiren began to argue that through &quot;bodily reading the Lotus Sutra,&quot; rather than just studying its text for literal meaning, a country and its people could be protected. According to Habito, Nichiren argued that bodily reading the Lotus Sutra entails four aspects:

:

His three-year exile to Sado Island proved to be another key turning point in Nichiren&#x27;s life. Here he began inscribing the &quot;Gohonzon&quot; and wrote several major theses in which he claimed that he was Bodhisattva Superior Practices, the leader of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth.

He concludes his work &quot;The Opening of the Eyes&quot; with the declaration &quot;I will be the pillar of Japan; I will be the eyes of Japan; I will be the vessel of Japan. Inviolable shall remain these vows!&quot; His thinking now went beyond theories of karmic retribution or guarantees of the Lotus Sutra as a protective force. Rather, he expressed a resolve to fulfill his mission despite the consequences. All of his disciples, he asserted, should emulate his spirit and work just like him in helping all people open their innate Buddha lives even though this means entails encountering enormous challenges.

==== Final stage: 1274–1282 ====
Nichiren&#x27;s teachings reached their full maturity between the years 1274 and 1282 while he resided in primitive settings at Mount Minobu located in today&#x27;s Yamanashi Prefecture. During this time he devoted himself to training disciples, produced most of the &quot;Gohonzon&quot; which he sent to followers, and authored works constituting half of his extant writings including six treatises that were categorized by his follower Nikkō as among his ten most important.

In 1278 the &quot;Atsuhara Affair&quot; (&quot;Atsuhara Persecution&quot;) occurred, culminating three years later. In the prior stage of his career, between 1261 and 1273, Nichiren endured and overcame numerous trials that were directed at him personally including assassination attempts, an attempted execution, and two exiles, thereby &quot;bodily reading the Lotus Sutra&quot; (&quot;shikidoku&quot; 色読). In so doing, according to him, he validated the 13th (&quot;Fortitude&quot;) chapter of the Lotus Sutra in which a host of bodhisattvas promise to face numerous trials that follow in the wake of upholding and spreading the sutra in the evil age following the death of the Buddha: slander and abuse; attack by swords and staves; enmity from kings, ministers, and respected monks; and repeated banishment.

On two occasions, however, the persecution was aimed at his followers. First, in 1271, in conjunction with the arrest and attempted execution of Nichiren and his subsequent exile to Sado, many of his disciples were arrested, banished, or had lands confiscated by the government. At that time, Nichiren stated, most recanted their faith in order to escape the government&#x27;s actions. In contrast, during the Atsuhara episode twenty lay peasant-farmer followers were arrested on questionable charges and tortured; three were ultimately executed. This time none recanted their faith. Some of his prominent followers in other parts of the country were also being persecuted but maintained their faith as well.

Although Nichiren was situated in Minobu, far from the scene of the persecution, the Fuji district of present-day Shizuoka Prefecture, Nichiren held his community together in the face of significant oppression through a sophisticated display of legal and rhetorical responses. He also drew on a wide array of support from the network of leading monks and lay disciples he had raised, some of whom were also experiencing persecution at the hands of the government.

Throughout the events he wrote many letters to his disciples in which he gave context to the unfolding events by asserting that severe trials have deep significance. According to Stone, &quot;By standing firm under interrogation, the Atsuhara peasants had proved their faith in Nichiren&#x27;s eyes, graduating in his estimation from &#x27;ignorant people&#x27; to devotees meriting equally with himself the name of &#x27;practitioners of the Lotus Sutra.&#x27;&quot; During this time Nichiren inscribed 114 mandalas that are extant today, 49 of which have been identified as being inscribed for individual lay followers and which may have served to deepen the bond between teacher and disciple. In addition, a few very large mandalas were inscribed, apparently intended for use at gathering places, suggesting the existence of some type of conventicle structure.

The Atsuhara Affair also gave Nichiren the opportunity to better define what was to become Nichiren Buddhism. He stressed that meeting great trials was a part of the practice of the Lotus Sutra; the great persecutions of Atsuhara were not results of karmic retribution but were the historical unfolding of the Buddhist Dharma. The vague &quot;single good of the true vehicle&quot; which he advocated in the &quot;Risshō ankoku ron&quot; now took final form as chanting the Lotus Sutra&#x27;s &quot;daimoku&quot; or title which he described as the heart of the &quot;origin teaching&quot; (&quot;honmon&quot; 本門) of the Lotus Sutra. This, he now claimed, lay hidden in the depths of the 16th (&quot;The Life Span of the Tathāgata&quot;) chapter, never before being revealed, but intended by the Buddha solely for the beginning of the Final Dharma Age.

===Nichiren&#x27;s writings===

A prolific writer, Nichiren&#x27;s personal communiques among his followers as well as numerous treatises detail his view of the correct form of practice for the &quot;Latter Day of the Law&quot; (&quot;mappō&quot;); lay out his views on other Buddhist schools, particularly those of influence during his lifetime; and elucidate his interpretations of Buddhist teachings that preceded his. These writings are collectively known as &quot;Gosho&quot; (御書) or &quot;Nichiren ibun&quot; (日蓮遺文).

Out of 162 historically identified followers of Nichiren, 47 were women. Many of his writings were to women followers in which he displays strong empathy for their struggles, and continually stressed the Lotus Sutra&#x27;s teaching that all people, men and women equally, can become enlightened just as they are. His voice is sensitive and kind which differs from the strident picture painted about him by critics.

Which of these writings, including the &quot;Ongi Kuden&quot; (orally transmitted teachings), are deemed authentic or apocryphal is a matter of debate within the various schools of today&#x27;s Nichiren Buddhism. His &quot;Rissho Ankoku Ron&quot;, preserved at Shochuzan Hokekyo-ji, is one of the National Treasures of Japan.

==Post-Nichiren development in Japan==
=== Development in Medieval Japan ===

After Nichiren&#x27;s death in 1282 the Kamakura shogunate weakened largely due to financial and political stresses resulting from defending the country from the Mongols. It was replaced by the Ashikaga shogunate (1336–1573), which in turn was succeeded by the Azuchi–Momoyama period (1573–1600), and then the Tokugawa shogunate (1600–1868). During these time periods, collectively comprising Japan&#x27;s medieval history, Nichiren Buddhism experienced considerable fracturing, growth, turbulence and decline. A prevailing characteristic of the movement in medieval Japan was its lack of understanding of Nichiren&#x27;s own spiritual realization. Serious commentaries about Nichiren&#x27;s theology did not appear for almost two hundred years. This contributed to divisive doctrinal confrontations that were often superficial and dogmatic.

This long history of foundings, divisions, and mergers have led to today&#x27;s 37 legally incorporated Nichiren Buddhist groups. In the modern period, Nichiren Buddhism experienced a revival, largely initiated by lay people and lay movements.

===Development of the major lineages===
Several denominations comprise the umbrella term &quot;Nichiren Buddhism&quot; which was known at the time as the &quot;Hokkeshū&quot; (Lotus School) or &quot;Nichirenshū&quot; (Nichiren School). The splintering of Nichiren&#x27;s teachings into different schools began several years after Nichiren&#x27;s passing. Despite their differences, however, the Nichiren groups shared commonalities: asserting the primacy of the Lotus Sutra, tracing Nichiren as their founder, centering religious practice on chanting &quot;Namu-myoho-renge-kyo&quot;, using the &quot;Gohonzon&quot; in meditative practice, insisting on the need for propagation, and participating in remonstrations with the authorities.

The movement was supported financially by local warlords or stewards (&quot;jitõ&quot;) who often founded tightly organized clan temples (&quot;ujidera&quot;) that were frequently led by sons who became priests. Most Nichiren schools point to the founding date of their respective head or main temple (for example, Nichiren Shū the year 1281, Nichiren Shōshū the year 1288, and Kempon Hokke Shu the year 1384) although they did not legally incorporate as religious bodies until the late 19th and early 20th century. A last wave of temple mergers took place in the 1950s.

The roots of this splintering can be traced to the organization of the Nichiren community during his life. In 1282, one year before his death, Nichiren named &quot;six senior priests&quot; (&quot;rokurōsō&quot;) disciple to lead his community: Nikkō Shonin (日興), Nisshō (日昭), Nichirō (日朗), Nikō (日向), Nitchō (日頂), and Nichiji (日持). Each had led communities of followers in different parts of the Kanto region of Japan and these groups, after Nichiren&#x27;s death, ultimately morphed into lineages of schools.

Nikkō Shonin, Nichirō, and Nisshō were the core of the Minobu (also known as the Nikō or Kuon-ji) &quot;monryu&quot; or school. Nikō became the second chief abbot of Minobu (Nichiren is considered by this school to be the first). Nichirō&#x27;s direct lineage was called the Nichirō or Hikigayatsu &quot;monryu&quot;. Nisshō&#x27;s lineage became the Nisshō or Hama &quot;monryu&quot;. Nitchō formed the Nakayama lineage but later returned to become a follower of Nikkō. Nichiji, originally another follower of Nikkō, eventually traveled to the Asian continent (ca. 1295) on a missionary journey and some scholarship suggests he reached northern China, Manchuria, and possibly Mongolia. Kuon-ji Temple in Mount Minobu eventually became the head temple of today&#x27;s Nichiren Shū, the largest branch among traditional schools, encompassing the schools and temples tracing their origins to Nikō, Nichirō, Nisshō, Nitchō, and Nichiji. The lay and/or new religious movements Reiyūkai, Risshō Kōsei Kai, and Nipponzan-Myōhōji-Daisanga stem from this lineage.

Nikkō left Kuon-ji in 1289 and became the founder of what was to be called the Nikkō &quot;monryu&quot; or lineage. He founded a center at the foot of Mount Fuji which would later be known as the Taisekiji temple of Nichiren Shōshū. Soka Gakkai is the largest independent lay organization that shares roots with this lineage.

Fault lines between the various Nichiren groups crystallized over several issues:
:Local gods. A deeply embedded and ritualized part of Japanese village life, Nichiren schools clashed over the practice of honoring local gods (kami) by lay disciples of Nichiren. Some argued that this practice was a necessary accommodation. The group led by the monk Nikkō objected to such syncretism.
:Content of Lotus Sūtra. Some schools (called &quot;Itchi&quot;) argued that all chapters of the sūtra should be equally valued and others (called &quot;Shōretsu&quot;) claimed that the latter half was superior to the former half. (See below for more details.)
:Identity of Nichiren. Some of his later disciples identified him with Visistacaritra, the leader of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth who were entrusted in Chapter Twenty-Two to propagate the Lotus Sūtra. The Nikkō group identified Nichiren as the original and eternal Buddha.
:Identification with Tiantai school. The Nisshō group began to identify itself as a Tiantai school, having no objections to its esoteric practices, perhaps as an expedient means to avoid persecution from Tiantai, Pure Land, and Shingon followers. This deepened the rift with Nikkō.
:The Three Gems. All schools of Buddhism speak of the concept of The Three Gems (the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha) but define it differently. Over the centuries the Nichiren schools have come to understand it differently as well. The Minobu school has come to identify the Buddha as Shakyamuni whereas the Nikkō school identifies it as Nichiren. For Minobu the Dharma is Namu-myoho-renge-kyo, the Nikkō school identifies it as the Namu-myoho-renge-kyo that is hidden in the 16th &quot;Lifespan&quot; Chapter of the Lotus Sutra (the &quot;Gohonzon&quot;). Currently, Nichiren Shoshu claims this specifically refers to the &quot;Dai Gohonzon&quot;, whereas Soka Gakkai holds it represents all &quot;Gohonzon&quot;. The Sangha, sometimes translated as &quot;the priest&quot;, is also interpreted differently. Minobu defines it as Nichiren; Nichiren Shoshu as Nikkō representing its priesthood; and the Soka Gakkai as Nikkō representing the harmonious community of practitioners.

The cleavage between Nichiren groups has also been classified by the so-called &quot;Itchi&quot; (meaning unity or harmony) and &quot;Shoretsu&quot; (a contraction of two words meaning superior/inferior) lineages.

* The &quot;Itchi&quot; lineage today comprises most of the traditional schools within Nichiren Buddhism, of which the Nichiren Shū is the biggest representative, although it also includes some Nikkō temples. In this lineage the whole of the Lotus Sutra, both the so-called theoretical (&quot;shakumon&quot; or &quot;Imprinted Gate&quot;) and essential (&quot;honmon&quot; or &quot;Original Gate&quot;) chapters, are venerated. While great attention is given to the 2nd and 16th chapter of the Lotus Sutra, other parts of the sutra are recited.
* The &quot;Shoretsu&quot; lineage comprises most temples and lay groups following the Nikkō &quot;monryu&quot;. The &quot;Shoretsu&quot; group values the supremacy of the essential over the theoretical part of the Lotus Sutra. Therefore, solely the 2nd and 16th chapters of the Lotus Sutra are recited. There are additional subdivisions in the &quot;Shoretsu&quot; group which splintered over whether the entire second half was of equal importance, the eight chapters of the second half when the assembly participates in &quot;The Ceremony of the Air,&quot; or specifically Chapter Sixteen (Lifespan of the Tathāgata).

==== Origin of the Fuji School ====
Although there were rivalries and unique interpretations among the early Hokkeshũ lineages, none were as deep and distinct as the divide between the Nikkō or Fuji school and the rest of the tradition. Animosity and discord among the six senior disciples started after the second death anniversary of Nichiren&#x27;s 100th Day Memorial ceremony (23 January 1283) when the rotation system as agreed upon the &quot;Shuso Gosenge Kiroku&quot; (English: Record document of founder&#x27;s demise) and &quot;Rimbo Cho&quot; (English: Rotation Wheel System) to clean and maintain Nichiren&#x27;s grave. By the third anniversary of Nichiren&#x27;s passing (13 October 1284), these arrangements seemed to have broken down. Nikkō claimed that the other five senior priests no longer returned to Nichiren&#x27;s tomb in Mount Minobu, citing signs of neglect at the gravesite. He took up residency and overall responsibility for Kuonji temple while Nikō served as its doctrinal instructor. Before long tensions grew between the two concerning the behavior of Hakii Nanbu Rokurō Sanenaga, the steward of the Minobu district and the temple&#x27;s patron.

Nikkō accused Sanenaga of unorthodox practices deemed to be heretical such as crafting a standing statue of Shakyamuni Buddha as an object of worship, providing funding for the construction of a Pure Land &quot;stupa&quot; in Fuji, and visiting and worshiping at the Mishima Taisha Shinto shrine which was an honorary shrine of the Hōjō clan shogunate. Nikkō regarded the latter as a violation of Nichiren&#x27;s &quot;Rissho ankoku ron&quot;.

In addition, Nikkō made accusatory charges that after Nichiren&#x27;s death, other disciples slowly began to gradually deviate from what Nikkō viewed as Nichiren&#x27;s orthodox teachings. Chief among these complaints was the syncretic practices of some of the disciples to worship images of Shakyamuni Buddha. Nikkō admonished other disciple priests for signing their names &quot;Tendai Shamon&quot; (of the Tendai Buddhist school) in documents they sent to the Kamakura government. Furthermore, Nikkō alleged that the other disciples disregarded some of Nichiren&#x27;s writings written in Katakana rather than in Classical Chinese syllabary.

Sanenaga defended his actions, claiming that it was customary for his political family to provide monetary donations and make homage to the Shinto shrine of the Kamakura shogunate. Nikō tolerated Sanenaga&#x27;s acts, claiming that similar incidents occurred previously with the knowledge of Nichiren. Sanenaga sided with Nikō and Nikkō departed in 1289 from Minobu. He returned to his home in Suruga Province and established two temples: Taiseki-ji in the Fuji district and Honmonji in Omosu district. He spent most of his life at the latter, where he trained his followers.

According to Stone, it is not absolutely clear that Nikkō intended to completely break from the other senior disciples and start his own school. However, his followers claimed that he was the only one of the six senior disciples who maintained the purity of Nichiren&#x27;s legacy. Two documents appeared, first mentioned and discovered by Taiseki-ji High Priest Nikkyo Shonin in 1488, claiming Nichiren transferred his teaching exclusively to Nikkō but their authenticity has been questioned. Taiseki-ji does not dispute that the original documents are missing but holds that certified copies are preserved in their repositories. In contrast, other Nichiren sects vehemently claim them as forgeries since they are not in the original handwriting of Nichiren or Nikkō, holding they were copied down by Nikkō&#x27;s disciples after his death.&quot;

In addition to using the letters to defend its claim to orthodoxy, the documents may have served to justify Taiseki-ji&#x27;s claimed superiority over other Nikkō temples, especially Ikegami Honmon-ji, the site of Nichiren&#x27;s tomb. Even though there had been efforts by temples of the Nikkō lineage in the late 19th century to unify into one single separate Nichiren school the &quot;Kommon-ha&quot;, today&#x27;s Nichiren Shōshū comprises only the Taiseki-ji temple and its dependent temples. It is not identical to the historical Nikkō or Fuji lineage. Parts of the &quot;Kommon-ha&quot;, the &quot;Honmon-Shu&quot;, eventually became part of Nichiren Shu in the 1950s. Japanese new religious movements such as the Sōka Gakkai, Shōshinkai, and Kenshōkai trace their origins to the Nichiren Shōshū school and they all eventually branched from it.

==== 15th century through the early 19th century ====
In the early 14th century Hokkeshū followers spread the teachings westward and established congregations (Jpn. &quot;shū&quot;) into the imperial capital of Kyoto and as far as Bizen and Bitchu. During this time there is documentation of face-to-face public debates between Hokkeshū and Nembutsu adherents. By the end of the century Hokkeshū temples had been founded all over Kyoto, only being outnumbered by Zen temples. The demographic base of support in Kyoto were members of the merchant class (Jpn. &quot;machishū&quot;), some of whom had acquired great wealth. Tanabe hypothesizes they were drawn to this faith because of Nichiren&#x27;s emphasis on the &quot;third realm&quot; (Jpn. &quot;daisan hōmon&quot;) of the Lotus Sutra, staked out in chapters 10–22, which emphasize practice in the mundane world.

In the 15th century, the political and social order began to collapse and Hokkeshū followers armed themselves. The &quot;Hokke-ikki&quot; was an uprising in 1532 of Hokke followers against the followers of the Pure Land school in 1532. Initially successful it became the most powerful religious group in Kyoto but its fortunes were reversed in 1536 when Mt. Hiei armed forces destroyed twenty-one Hokkeshū temples and killed some 58,000 of its followers. In 1542 permission was granted by the government to rebuild the destroyed temples and the Hokke &quot;machishū&quot; played a crucial role in rebuilding the commerce, industry, and arts in Kyoto. Their influence in the arts and literature continued through the Momoyama (1568–1615) and Edo (1615–1868) periods and many of the most famous artists and literati were drawn from their ranks.

Although the various sects of Nichiren Buddhism were administratively independent, there is evidence of cooperation between them. For example, in 1466 the major Hokke temples in Kyoto signed the Kanshō-era accord (Kanshō &quot;meiyaku&quot;) to protect themselves against threats from Mt. Hiei. Despite strong sectarian differences, there is also evidence of interactions between Hokkeshū and Tendai scholar-monks.

During the Edo period, with the consolidation of power by the Tokugawa shogunate, increased pressure was placed major Buddhist schools and Nichiren temples to conform to governmental policies. Some Hokkeshū adherents, the followers of the so-called Fuju-fuse lineage, adamantly bucked this policy based on their readings of Nichiren&#x27;s teachings to neither take (&quot;fuju&quot;) nor give (&quot;fuse&quot;) offerings from non-believers. Suppressed, adherents often held their meetings clandestinely which led to the Fuju-fuse persecution and numerous executions of believers in 1668. During this time of persecution, most likely to prevent young priests from adopting a passion for propagation, Nichiren seminaries emphasized Tendai studies with only a few top-ranking students permitted to study some of Nichiren&#x27;s writings.

During the Edo period the majority of Hokkeshū temples were subsumed into the shogunate&#x27;s Danka system, an imposed nationwide parish system designed to ensure religious peace and root out Christianity. In this system Buddhist temples, in addition to their ceremonial duties, were forced to carry out state administrative functions. Thereby they became agents of the government and were prohibited to engage in any missionary activities. Hokkeshū temples were now obligated, just like those of other Buddhist schools, to focus on funeral and memorial services (&quot;Sōshiki bukkyō&quot;) as their main activity. Stagnation was often the price for the protected status.

==== 19th century: From Tokugawa to Meiji periods ====
Nichiren Buddhism was deeply influenced by the transition from the Tokugawa (1600–1868) to Meiji (1868–1912) periods in nineteenth-century Japan. The changeover from early modern (&quot;kinsei&quot;) to modern (&quot;kindai&quot;) was marked by the transformation of late-feudal institutions into modern ones as well as the political transition from shogunal to imperial rule and the economic shift from national isolation to integration in the world economy. This entailed creating a centralized state, stitching together some 260 feudal domains ruled by hereditary leaders (&quot;daimyō&quot;), and moving from a caste social system to a meritocracy based on educational achievement. Although commonly perceived as a singular event called the Meiji Restoration, the transition was full of twists and turns that began in the later Tokugawa years and continued decades after the 1867–1868 demise of the shogunate and launch of imperial rule.

By this time Japanese Buddhism was often characterized by syncretism in which local nativistic worship was incorporated into Buddhist practice. For example, Tendai, Shingon, Jodō, and Nichiren temples often had chapels within them dedicated to Inari Shinto worship. Within Nichiren Buddhism there was a phenomenon of &quot;Hokke Shintō&quot; (Lotus Shinto), closely influenced by Yoshida Shintō.

Anti-Buddhist sentiment had been building throughout the latter part of the Tokugawa period (1603–1868). Scholars such as Tominaga Nakamoto and Hirata Atsutane attacked the theoretical roots of Buddhism. Critics included promoters of Confucianism, nativism, Shinto-inspired Restorationists, and modernizers. Buddhism was critiqued as a needless drain on public resources and also as an insidious foreign influence that had obscured the indigenous Japanese spirit.

Under attack by two policies of the day, &quot;shinbutsu bunri&quot; (Separation of Shinto Deities and Buddhas) and &quot;haibutsu kishaku&quot; (Eradication of Buddhism), Japanese Buddhism during the Tokugawa-to-Meiji transition proved to be a crisis of survival. The new government promoted policies that reduced the material resources available to Buddhist temples and downgraded their role in the religious, political, and social life of the nation.

The policies of &quot;shibutsu bunri&quot; were implemented at the local level throughout Japan but were particularly intense in three domains that were the most active in the Restoration: Satsuma, Choshii, and Tosa. In Satsuma, for example, by 1872 all of its 1000+ Buddhist temples had been abolished, their monks laicized, and their landholdings confiscated. Throughout the country thousands of Buddhist temples and, at a minimum, tens of thousands of Buddhist sutras, paintings, statues, temple bells and other ritual objects were destroyed, stolen, lost, or sold during the early years of the restoration.

Starting in the second decade of the restoration, pushback against these policies came from Western powers interested in providing a safe harbor for Christianity and Buddhist leaders who proposed an alliance of Shinto and Buddhism to resist Christianity. As part of this accommodation, Buddhist priests were forced to promote key teachings of Shinto and provide support for national policies.

Nichiren Buddhism, like the other Buddhist schools, struggled between accommodation and confrontation. The Nichiren scholar Udana-in Nichiki (1800–1859) argued for a policy of co-existence with other schools of Buddhism, Confucianism, Nativism, and European religions. His disciple Arai Nissatsu (1830–1888) forged an alliance of several Nichiren branches and became the first superintendent of the present Nichiren Shū which was incorporated in 1876. Nissatsu was active in Buddhist intersect cooperation to resist the government&#x27;s hostile policies, adopted the government&#x27;s &quot;Great Teaching&quot; policy that was Shinto-derived, and promoted intersectarian understanding. In the process, however, he reinterpreted some of Nichiren&#x27;s important teachings. Among those arguing against accommodation were Nichiren scholar and lay believer Ogawa Taidō (1814–1878) and the cleric Honda Nisshō (1867–1931) of the Kempon Hokke denomination.

After the above events and centuries of splintering based on dogma and institutional histories, the following major Nichiren temple schools, according to Matsunaga, were officially recognized in the Meiji era:
* 1874: Nichiren-shū (formerly &quot;Minobu monryū&quot;). This school&#x27;s headquarters was at Kuon-ji temple and held the &quot;Itchi&quot; perspective that advocated the equal treatment of all sections of the Lotus Sutra. However, it also included five schools that maintained the &quot;Shoretsu&quot; perspective which emphasized the latter half of the Lotus Sutra: Myōmanji, Happon, Honjōji, Honryūji, and Fuji-ha
* 1876: The Fuju-fuse-ha was recognized by the government after years of clandestine operation following episodes of persecution. In 1882 a second &quot;Fuju-fuse&quot; sect was recognized, the Fuju-Fuse Kōmon-ha.
* 1891: The five &quot;Shoretsu&quot; schools changed their names
:Myōmanji-ha became Kempon Hokke based at Myōmanji, Kyoto
:Happon-ha became Honmon Hokkeshū based in Honjōji, Niigata
:Honjōji-ha became Hokkeshū based in Honryūji, Kyoto
:Honryūji-ha became Honmyō Hokkeshū, also based in Honryūji, Kyoto
:Fuji-ha became Honmonshū in Monmonji, Shizuoka
* 1900: The Taisekiji temple of Shizuoka broke off from the Honmonshū and became Nichirenshū Fuji-ha. In 1913, this group was renamed Nichiren Shōshū which was popularized by the Soka Gakkai lay organization. Although the latter has a sizeable membership and it is one of the important Japanese new religions (&quot;shinshūkyō&quot;), it is not included in many treatments of Nichiren lineages.

=== Development in modern Japanese history ===
Nichiren Buddhism went through many reforms in the Meiji Period during a time of persecution, Haibutsu kishaku (廃仏毀釈), when the government attempted to eradicate mainstream Japanese Buddhism. As a part of the Meiji Restoration, the interdependent Danka system between the state and Buddhist temples was dismantled which left the latter without its funding. Buddhist institutions had to align themselves to the new nationalistic agenda or perish. Many of these reform efforts were led by lay people.

The trend toward lay centrality was prominent in Nichiren Buddhism as well, predating the Meiji period. Some Nichiren reformers in the Meiji period attempted to inject a nationalistic interpretation of Nichiren&#x27;s teachings; others called for globalist perspectives. According to Japanese researcher &quot;Yoshiro Tamura&quot;, the term &quot;Nichirenism&quot; applies broadly to the following three categories:
# The ultranationalistic preoccupation with Nichiren that contributed to Japan&#x27;s militaristic effort before World War II.
# Socialist activists and writers during the prewar and postwar eras who promoted a vision of an ideal world society inspired by the Lotus Sutra and according to their own views of Nichiren.
# Organized religious bodies that were inspired by Nichiren&#x27;s teachings.

==== As a form of nationalism ====

Both Nichiren and his followers have been associated with fervent Japanese nationalism specifically identified as Nichirenism between the Meiji period and the conclusion of World War II. The nationalistic interpretation of Nichiren&#x27;s teachings were inspired by lay Buddhist movements like Kokuchūkai and resulted in violent historical events such as the May 15 Incident and the League of Blood Incident. Among the key proponents of this interpretation are Chigaku Tanaka who founded the Kokuchūkai (English: Nation&#x27;s Pillar Society). Tanaka was charismatic and through his writings and lecturers attracted many followers such as Kanji Ishiwara. Nisshō Honda advocated the unification of Japanese Buddhists to support the imperial state. Other ultra-nationalist activists who based their ideas on Nichiren were Ikki Kita and Nisshō Inoue.

==== As a form of socialism ====
Nichirenism also includes several intellectuals and activists who reacted against the prewar ultranationalistic interpretations and argued for an egalitarian and socialist vision of society based on Nichiren&#x27;s teachings and the Lotus Sutra. These figures ran against the growing tide of Japanese militarism and were subjected to political harassment and persecution. A leading figure in this group was Girō Seno who formed the New Buddhist Youth League (&quot;Shinkō Bukkyō Seinen Dōmei&quot;).

Originally influenced by the ideals of Tanaka and Honda, Giro Seno came to reject ultra-nationalism and argued for humanism, socialism, pacifism, and democracy as a new interpretation of Nichiren&#x27;s beliefs. He was imprisoned for two years under the National Security Act. The same fate was also endured by Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, who refused the religious dictum of Shinto display accepted by Nichiren Shoshu for the &quot;Soka Kyoiku Gakkai&quot;, his lay organization composed of primarily secretaries and teachers until it grew to become Soka Gakkai after World War II.

==== Within new social and religious movements ====

Several Nichiren-inspired religious movements arose and appealed primarily to this segment of society with a message of alleviating suffering salvation for many poor urban workers. Honmon Butsuryū-shū, an early example of lay-based religious movements of the modern period inspired by Nichiren, was founded several years before the Meiji Restoration. Reiyukai, Rissho Koseikai stemming from Nichiren Shu while Kenshokai and Soka Gakkai once affiliated with Nichiren Shoshu and the Japanese principle &quot;Shin&quot;(信 ), &quot;Gyo&quot; (行), &quot;Gaku&quot; (学)&quot; as &quot;Faith, Practices, Study&quot;, are more recent examples of lay-inspired movements drawing from Nichiren&#x27;s teachings and life.

==== In culture and literature ====
Nichiren Buddhism has had a major impact on Japan&#x27;s literary and cultural life. Japanese literary figure Takayama Chogyū and children&#x27;s author Kenji Miyazawa praised Nichiren&#x27;s teachings. A prominent researcher, Masaharu Anesaki, was encouraged to study Nichiren which led to the work &quot;Nichiren: The Buddhist Prophet&quot; which introduced Nichiren to the West. Non-Buddhist Japanese individuals such as Uchimura Kanzō listed Nichiren as one of five historical figures who best represented Japan, while Tadao Yanaihara described Nichiren as one of the four historical figures he most admired.

== Globalization ==
While various sects and organizations have had a presence in nations outside Japan for over a century, the genuine expansion of Nichiren Buddhism overseas started in 1960 when Soka Gakkai president Daisaku Ikeda initiated his group&#x27;s worldwide propagation efforts stemming from a few hundred transplanted Japanese to over 3500 families by 1962.

Nichiren Buddhism is now practiced in many countries outside of Japan. In the United States, religious studies scholar Charles S. Prebish coined the typology of &quot;two Buddhisms&quot; to delineate the divide between forms of Buddhism that appealed either primarily to people of the Asian diaspora or to Euro-American converts. Nattier, on the other hand, proposes a three-way typology. &quot;Import&quot; or &quot;elite&quot; Buddhism refers to a class of people who have the time and means to seek Buddhist teachers to appropriate certain Buddhist techniques such as meditation. &quot;Export or evangelical&quot; Buddhism refers to groups that actively proselytize for new members in their local organizations. &quot;Baggage&quot; or &quot;ethnic&quot; Buddhism refers to diaspora Buddhists, usually of a single ethnic group, who have relocated more for social and economic advancement than for evangelical purposes. Another taxonomy divides Western Buddhist groups into three different categories: evangelical, church-like, and meditational.

Nichiren Shu has been classified into the church-like category. One of several Japanese Buddhist schools that followed in the wake of Japanese military conquest and colonization, Nichiren Shu opened a temple in Pusan, Korea in 1881. Its fortunes rose and diminished with the political tides but eventually failed. It also established missions in Sakhalin, Manchuria, and Taiwan. A Nichiren Shu mission was established in Hawaii in 1900. By 1920 it established temples at Pahala, Honolulu, Wailuku and Maui. In 1955, it officially started a mission in Brazil. In 1991, it established the Nichiren Buddhist International Center in 1991 and in 2002 built a center in Hayward, California, to help overseas missions. However, Nichiren Shu does not widely propagate in the West.

Some have characterized the Soka Gakkai as evangelical but others claim that it broke out of the &quot;Two Buddhisms&quot; paradigm. It is quite multi-ethnic and it has taken hold among native populations in locations including Korea, Malaysia, Brazil, Europe, parts of Africa, India, and North America. The growth of the Soka Gakkai was sparked by repeated missionary trips beginning in the early 1960s by Daisaku Ikeda, its third president. In 1975 the Soka Gakkai International was launched in Guam. In the United States it has attracted a diverse membership including a significant demographic of African Americans. Since the 1970s, it has created institutions, publications and exhibitions to support its overall theme of &quot;peace, culture, and education.&quot; There is academic research on various national organizations affiliated with this movement: the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, Brazil, Scotland, Southeast Asia, Germany, and Thailand.

The Rissho Kosei Kai focuses on using its teachings to promote a culture of religiosity through inter-religious dialogue. In 1967, it launched the &quot;Faith to All Men Movement&quot; to awaken a globalized religiosity. It has over 2 million members and 300 Dharma centers in 20 countries throughout the world including Frankfurt and Moorslede. It is active in interfaith organizations, including the International Association for Religious Freedom (IARF) and Religions for Peace (WCRP). It has consultative states with the United Nations and since 1983 issues an annual Peace Prize to individuals or organizations worldwide that work for peace and development and promote interreligious cooperation.

The Reiyukai conducts more typical missionary activities in the West. It has a membership of between five hundred and one thousand members in Europe, concentrated in Italy, Spain, England and France. The approximately 1,500 members of the Nihonzan Myohoji have built peace pagodas, conducted parades beating the drum while chanting the daimoku, and encouraged themselves and others to create world peace.

Nichiren Shoshu has six temples in the United States led by Japanese priests and supported by lay Asians and non-Asians. There is one temple in Brazil and the residing priest serves as a &quot;circuit rider&quot; to attend to other locations.

<text>Newport News Shipbuilding (NNS), a division of Huntington Ingalls Industries, is the sole designer, builder, and refueler of aircraft carriers and one of two providers of submarines for the United States Navy. Founded as the Chesapeake Dry Dock and Construction Co. in 1886, Newport News Shipbuilding has built more than 800 ships, including both naval and commercial ships. Located in the city of Newport News, Virginia, its facilities span more than .

The shipyard is a major employer, not only for the lower Virginia Peninsula, but also portions of Hampton Roads south of the James River and the harbor, portions of the Middle Peninsula region, and even some northeastern counties of North Carolina.

The shipyard is building two s: , and .

In 2013, Newport News Shipbuilding began the deactivation of the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, , which it also built.

Newport News Shipbuilding also performs refueling and complex overhaul (RCOH) work on s. This is a four-year vessel renewal program that not only involves refueling of the vessel&#x27;s nuclear reactors but also includes modernization work. The yard has completed RCOH for five &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carriers (, , , and ). As of November 2017 this work was underway for the sixth &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class vessel, .

==History==

Industrialist Collis P. Huntington (1821–1900) provided crucial funding to complete the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad (C&amp;O) from Richmond, Virginia, to the Ohio River in the early 1870s. Although originally built for general commerce, this C&amp;O rail link to the midwest was soon also being used to transport bituminous coal from the previously isolated coalfields, adjacent to the New River and the Kanawha River in West Virginia. In 1881, the Peninsula Extension of the C&amp;O was built from Richmond down the Virginia Peninsula to reach a new coal pier on Hampton Roads in Warwick County near the small unincorporated community of Newport News Point. However, building the railroad and coal pier was only the first part of Huntington&#x27;s dreams for Newport News.

===The shipyard&#x27;s early years===

In 1886, Huntington built a shipyard to repair ships servicing this transportation hub. In 1891 Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company delivered its first ship, the tugboat &quot;Dorothy&quot;. By 1897 NNS had built three warships for the US Navy: , and .

When Collis died in 1900, his nephew Henry E. Huntington inherited much of his uncle&#x27;s fortune. He also married Collis&#x27; widow Arabella Huntington, and assumed Collis&#x27; leadership role with Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. Under Henry Huntington&#x27;s leadership, growth continued.

In 1906 the revolutionary launched a great naval race worldwide. Between 1907 and 1923, Newport News built six of the US Navy&#x27;s total of 22 dreadnoughts – , , , , and . All but the first were in active service in World War II. In 1907 President Theodore Roosevelt sent the Great White Fleet on its round-the-world voyage. NNS had built seven of its 16 battleships.

In 1914 NNS built SS &quot;Medina&quot; for the Mallory Steamship Company; as she was until 2009 the world&#x27;s oldest active ocean-faring passenger ship.

===Newport News and the shipyard===

In the early years, leaders of the Newport News community and those of the shipyard were virtually interchangeable. Shipyard president Walter A. Post served from March 9, 1911, to February 12, 1912, when he died. Earlier, he had come to the area as one of the builders of the C&amp;O Railway&#x27;s terminals, and had served as the first mayor of Newport News after it became an independent city in 1896. It was on March 14, 1914, that Albert Lloyd Hopkins, a young New Yorker trained in engineering, succeeded Post as president of the company. In May 1915 while traveling to England on shipyard business aboard , Hopkins died when that ship was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat off Queenstown on the Irish coast. His assistant, Frederic Gauntlett, was also on board, but was able to swim to safety. Homer Lenoir Ferguson was company vice president when Hopkins died, and assumed the presidency the following August. He saw the company through both world wars, became a noted community leader, and was a co-founder of the Mariners&#x27; Museum with Archer Huntington. He served until July 31, 1946, after World War II had ended on both the European and Pacific fronts.
Just northwest of the shipyard, Hilton Village, one of the first planned communities in the country, was built by the federal government to house shipyard workers in 1918. The planners met with the wives of shipyard workers. Based on their input 14 house plans were designed for the projected 500 English-village-style homes. After the war, in 1922, Henry Huntington acquired it from the government, and helped facilitate the sale of the homes to shipyard employees and other local residents. Three streets there were named after Post, Hopkins, and Ferguson.

===Navy orders during and after World War I===
The &quot;Lusitania&quot; incident was among the events that brought the United States into World War I. Between 1918 and 1920 NNS delivered 25 destroyers, and after the war it began building aircraft carriers. was delivered in 1934, and NNS went on to build and .

===Ocean liners===
After World War I NNS completed a major reconditioning and refurbishment of the ocean liner . Before the war she had been the German liner &quot;Vaterland&quot;, but the start of hostilities found her laid up in New York Harbor and she had been seized by the US Government in 1917 and converted into a troopship. War duty and age meant that all wiring, plumbing, and interior layouts were stripped and redesigned while her hull was strengthened and her boilers converted from coal to oil while being refurbished. Virtually a new ship emerged from NNS in 1923, and SS &quot;Leviathan&quot; became the flagship of United States Lines.

In 1927 NNS launched the world&#x27;s first significant turbo-electric ocean liner: Panama Pacific Line&#x27;s . At the time she was also the largest merchant ship yet built in the United States, although she was a modest size compared with the biggest European liners of her era. NNS launched &quot;California&quot;″s sister ships &quot;Virginia&quot; in 1928 and &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; in 1929. NNS followed them by launching two even larger turbo-electric liners for Dollar Steamship Company: the in 1930, followed by her sister in 1931. was launched in 1939 and entered service with United States lines shortly before World War II but soon returned to the shipyard for conversion to a troopship, USS &quot;West Point&quot;.

===Navy orders before and during World War II===

By 1940 the Navy had ordered a battleship, seven more aircraft carriers and four cruisers. During World War II, NNS built ships as part of the U.S. government&#x27;s Emergency Shipbuilding Program, and swiftly filled requests for &quot;Liberty ships&quot; that were needed during the war. It founded the North Carolina Shipbuilding Company, an emergency yard on the banks of the Cape Fear River and launched its first Liberty ship before the end of 1941, building 243 ships in all, including 186 Libertys. For its contributions during the war, the Navy awarded the company its &quot;E&quot; pennant for excellence in shipbuilding. NNS ranked 23rd among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.

===Post-war ships===
In the post-war years NNS built the passenger liner , which set a transatlantic speed record that still stands today. In 1954 NNS, Westinghouse and the US Navy developed and built a prototype nuclear reactor for a carrier propulsion system. NNS designed in 1960. In 1959 NNS launched its first nuclear-powered submarine, .

In the 1970s, NNS launched two of the largest tankers ever built in the western hemisphere and also constructed three liquefied natural gas carriers – at over 390,000 deadweight tons, the largest ever built in the United States. NNS and Westinghouse Electric Company jointly formed Offshore Power Systems to build floating nuclear power plants for Public Service Electric and Gas Company.

In the 1980s, NNS produced a variety of Navy products, including nuclear aircraft carriers and nuclear attack submarines. Since 1999 the shipyard has only produced warships for the Navy.

===Submarine building problems===
In 2007, the US Navy found that workers had used the incorrect metal to fuse together pipes and joints on submarines under construction and this could have eventually led to cracking and leaks. In 2009 it was found that bolts and fasteners in weapons-handling systems on four Navy submarines, , , , and , were installed incorrectly, delaying the launching of the boats while the problems were corrected.

===Mergers, realignment, and spin-off===
In 1968, Newport News merged with Tenneco Corporation. In 1996, Tenneco initiated a spinoff of Newport News into an independent company (Newport News Shipbuilding). In 2001, General Dynamics made a second bid to purchase the company after a failed bid in 1999. Such a merger would have eliminated competition for the production of &quot;Virginia&quot;-class submarines, which have only been made by Newport News and GD subsidiary Electric Boat. Northrop Grumman matched GD with a similar bid, and following a Department of Justice anti-trust lawsuit to block GD&#x27;s bid, GD called off their bid. Now as the sole bidder, Northrop Grumman purchased the company for $2.6 billion and renamed it &quot;Northrop Grumman Newport News&quot;. This division was merged with Northrop Grumman Ship Systems in 2008 and given the name &quot;Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding&quot;. Three years later, the company was spun off as Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc., which trades under the symbol HII on the New York Stock Exchange.

<doc id="22145" wikidata="Q374195" url="?curid=22145" title="Newton's method">
<text>In numerical analysis, the Newton–Raphson method, also known simply as Newton&#x27;s method, named after Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson, is a root-finding algorithm which produces successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. The most basic version starts with a real-valued function , its derivative , and an initial guess for a root of . If satisfies certain assumptions and the initial guess is close, then

formula_1

is a better approximation of the root than . Geometrically, is the x-intercept of the tangent of the graph of at : that is, the improved guess, , is the unique root of the linear approximation of at the initial guess, . The process is repeated as

formula_2

until a sufficiently precise value is reached. The number of correct digits roughly doubles with each step. This algorithm is first in the class of Householder&#x27;s methods, and was succeeded by Halley&#x27;s method. The method can also be extended to complex functions and to systems of equations.

== Description ==

The idea is to start with an initial guess, then to approximate the function by its tangent line, and finally to compute the -intercept of this tangent line. This -intercept will typically be a better approximation to the original function&#x27;s root than the first guess, and the method can be iterated.

If the tangent line to the curve at intercepts the -axis at then the slope is

formula_3

Solving for gives

formula_4

We start the process with some arbitrary initial value . (The closer to the zero, the better. But, in the absence of any intuition about where the zero might lie, a &quot;guess and check&quot; method might narrow the possibilities to a reasonably small interval by appealing to the intermediate value theorem.) The method will usually converge, provided this initial guess is close enough to the unknown zero, and that . Furthermore, for a zero of multiplicity 1, the convergence is at least quadratic (see &quot;Rate of convergence&quot;) in a neighbourhood of the zero, which intuitively means that the number of correct digits roughly doubles in every step. More details can be found in &quot;&quot; below.

Householder&#x27;s methods are similar but have higher order for even faster convergence. However, the extra computations required for each step can slow down the overall performance relative to Newton&#x27;s method, particularly if or its derivatives are computationally expensive to evaluate.

==History==
In the Old Babylonian period (19th–16th century BCE), the side of a square of known area could be effectively approximated, and this is conjectured to have been done using a special case of Newton&#x27;s method, described algebraically below, by iteratively improving an initial estimate; an equivalent method can be found in Heron of Alexandria&#x27;s &quot;Metrica&quot; (1st–2nd century CE), so is often called &quot;Heron&#x27;s method&quot;. Jamshīd al-Kāshī used a method to solve to find roots of &quot;&quot;, a method that was algebraically equivalent to Newton&#x27;s method, and in which a similar method was found in &quot;Trigonometria Britannica&quot;, published by Henry Briggs in 1633.

The method first appeared roughly in Isaac Newton&#x27;s work in &quot;De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas&quot; (written in 1669, published in 1711 by William Jones) and in &quot;De metodis fluxionum et serierum infinitarum&quot; (written in 1671, translated and published as &quot;Method of Fluxions&quot; in 1736 by John Colson). However, while Newton gave the basic ideas, his method differs from the modern method given above. He applied the method only to polynomials, starting with an initial root estimate and extracting a sequence of error corrections. He used each correction to rewrite the polynomial in terms of the remaining error, and then solved for a new correction by neglecting higher-degree terms. He did not explicitly connect the method with derivatives or present a general formula. Newton applied this method to both numerical and algebraic problems, producing Taylor series in the latter case.

Newton may have derived his method from a similar, less precise method by mathematician François Viète, however, the two methods are not the same. The essence of Viète&#x27;s own method can be found in the work of the Persian mathematician Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi.

The Japanese mathematician Seki Kōwa used a form of Newton&#x27;s method in the 1670s to solve single-variable equations, though the connection with calculus was missing.

Newton&#x27;s method was first published in 1685 in &quot;A Treatise of Algebra both Historical and Practical&quot; by John Wallis. In 1690, Joseph Raphson published a simplified description in &quot;Analysis aequationum universalis&quot;. Raphson also applied the method only to polynomials, but he avoided Newton&#x27;s tedious rewriting process by extracting each successive correction from the original polynomial. This allowed him to derive a reusable iterative expression for each problem. Finally, in 1740, Thomas Simpson described Newton&#x27;s method as an iterative method for solving general nonlinear equations using calculus, essentially giving the description above. In the same publication, Simpson also gives the generalization to systems of two equations and notes that Newton&#x27;s method can be used for solving optimization problems by setting the gradient to zero.

Arthur Cayley in 1879 in &quot;The Newton–Fourier imaginary problem&quot; was the first to notice the difficulties in generalizing Newton&#x27;s method to complex roots of polynomials with degree greater than 2 and complex initial values. This opened the way to the study of the theory of iterations of rational functions.

==Practical considerations==
Newton&#x27;s method is a powerful technique—if the derivative of the function at the root is nonzero, then the convergence is at least quadratic: as the method converges on the root, the difference between the root and the approximation is squared (the number of accurate digits roughly doubles) at each step. However, there are some difficulties with the method.

===Difficulty in calculating the derivative of a function===
Newton&#x27;s method requires that the derivative can be calculated directly. An analytical expression for the derivative may not be easily obtainable or could be expensive to evaluate. In these situations, it may be appropriate to approximate the derivative by using the slope of a line through two nearby points on the function. Using this approximation would result in something like the secant method whose convergence is slower than that of Newton&#x27;s method.

===Failure of the method to converge to the root===
It is important to review the proof of quadratic convergence of Newton&#x27;s method before implementing it. Specifically, one should review the assumptions made in the proof. For situations where the method fails to converge, it is because the assumptions made in this proof are not met.

For example, in some cases, if the first derivative is not well behaved in the neighborhood of a particular root, then it is possible that Newton&#x27;s method will fail to converge no matter where the initialization is set. In some cases, Newton&#x27;s method can be stabilized by using successive over-relaxation, or the speed of convergence can be increased by using the same method.

In a robust implementation of Newton&#x27;s method, it is common to place limits on the number of iterations, bound the solution to an interval known to contain the root, and combine the method with a more robust root finding method.

===Slow convergence for roots of multiplicity greater than 1===
If the root being sought has multiplicity greater than one, the convergence rate is merely linear (errors reduced by a constant factor at each step) unless special steps are taken. When there are two or more roots that are close together then it may take many iterations before the iterates get close enough to one of them for the quadratic convergence to be apparent. However, if the multiplicity of the root is known, the following modified algorithm preserves the quadratic convergence rate:

formula_5

This is equivalent to using successive over-relaxation. On the other hand, if the multiplicity of the root is not known, it is possible to estimate after carrying out one or two iterations, and then use that value to increase the rate of convergence.

If the multiplicity of the root is finite then will have a root at the same location with multiplicity 1. Applying Newton&#x27;s method to find the root of recovers quadratic convergence in many cases although it generally involves the second derivative of . In a particularly simple case, if then and Newton&#x27;s method finds the root in a single iteration with

formula_6

==Analysis==
Suppose that the function has a zero at , i.e., , and is differentiable in a neighborhood of .

If is continuously differentiable and its derivative is nonzero at , then there exists a neighborhood of such that for all starting values in that neighborhood, the sequence will converge to .

If is continuously differentiable, its derivative is nonzero at , &quot;and&quot; it has a second derivative at , then the convergence is quadratic or faster. If the second derivative is not 0 at then the convergence is merely quadratic. If the third derivative exists and is bounded in a neighborhood of , then:

formula_7

where

formula_8

If the derivative is 0 at , then the convergence is usually only linear. Specifically, if is twice continuously differentiable, and , then there exists a neighborhood of such that, for all starting values in that neighborhood, the sequence of iterates converges linearly, with rate . Alternatively, if and for ,  in a neighborhood of , being a zero of multiplicity , and if , then there exists a neighborhood of such that, for all starting values in that neighborhood, the sequence of iterates converges linearly.

However, even linear convergence is not guaranteed in pathological situations.

In practice, these results are local, and the neighborhood of convergence is not known in advance. But there are also some results on global convergence: for instance, given a right neighborhood of , if is twice differentiable in and if , in , then, for each in the sequence is monotonically decreasing to .

===Proof of quadratic convergence for Newton&#x27;s iterative method===
According to Taylor&#x27;s theorem, any function which has a continuous second derivative can be represented by an expansion about a point that is close to a root of . Suppose this root is . Then the expansion of about is:
where the Lagrange form of the Taylor series expansion remainder is

formula_9

where is in between and .

Since is the root, () becomes:

Dividing equation () by and rearranging gives

Remembering that is defined by

one finds that

formula_10

That is,

Taking the absolute value of both sides gives

\right| = \frac {\left| f&quot; (\xi_n) \right| }{2 \left| f&#x27;(x_n) \right|} \cdot \varepsilon_n^2 \. &lt;/math&gt; |6}}

Equation () shows that the order of convergence is at least quadratic if the following conditions are satisfied:

# ; for all , where is the interval ;
# is continuous, for all ;

where is given by

formula_11

If these conditions hold,

formula_12

===Fourier conditions===

Suppose that is a concave function on an interval, which is strictly increasing. If it is negative at the left endpoint and positive at the right endpoint, the intermediate value theorem guarantees that there is a zero of somewhere in the interval. From geometrical principles, it can be seen that the Newton iteration starting at the left endpoint is monotonically increasing and convergent, necessarily to .

Joseph Fourier introduced a modification of Newton&#x27;s method starting at the right endpoint:
:formula_13
This sequence is monotonically decreasing and convergent. By passing to the limit in this definition, it can be seen that the limit of must also be the zero . 

So, in the case of a concave increasing function with a zero, initialization is largely irrelevant. Newton iteration starting anywhere left of the zero will converge, as will Fourier&#x27;s modified Newton iteration starting anywhere right of the zero. The accuracy at any step of the iteration can be determined directly from the difference between the location of the iteration from the left and the location of the iteration from the right. If is twice continuously differentiable, it can be proved using Taylor&#x27;s theorem that
:formula_14
showing that this difference in locations converges quadratically to zero.

All of the above can be extended to systems of equations in multiple variables, although in that context the relevant concepts of monotonicity and concavity are more subtle to formulate. In the case of single equations in a single variable, the above monotonic convergence of Newton&#x27;s method can also be generalized to replace concavity by positivity or negativity conditions on an arbitrary higher-order derivative of . However, in this generalization, Newton&#x27;s iteration is modified so as to be based on Taylor polynomials rather than the tangent line. In the case of concavity, this modification coincides with the standard Newton method.

==Examples==
===Use of Newton&#x27;s method to compute square roots===
Newton&#x27;s method is one of many known methods of computing square roots. Given a positive number , the problem of finding a number such that is equivalent to finding a root of the function . The Newton iteration defined by this function is given by
:formula_15
This happens to coincide with the &quot;Babylonian&quot; method of finding square roots, which consists of replacing an approximate root by the arithmetic mean of and . By performing this iteration, it is possible to evaluate a square root to any desired accuracy by only using the basic arithmetic operations.

The following three tables show examples of the result of this computation for finding the square root of 612, with the iteration initialized at the values of 1, 10, and −20. Each row in a &quot;&quot; column is obtained by applying the preceding formula to the entry above it, for instance
:formula_16

The correct digits are underlined. It is seen that with only a few iterations one can obtain a solution accurate to many decimal places. The first table shows that this is true even if the Newton iteration were initialized by the very inaccurate guess of .

When computing any nonzero square root, the first derivative of must be nonzero at the root, and that is a smooth function. So, even before any computation, it is known that any convergent Newton iteration has a quadratic rate of convergence. This is reflected in the above tables by the fact that once a Newton iterate gets close to the root, the number of correct digits approximately doubles with each iteration.

=== Solution of using Newton&#x27;s method ===
Consider the problem of finding the positive number with . We can rephrase that as finding the zero of . We have . Since for all and for , we know that our solution lies between 0 and 1. 

A starting value of 0 will lead to an undefined result which illustrates the importance of using a starting point close to the solution. For example, with an initial guess , the sequence given by Newton&#x27;s method is:

formula_17

The correct digits are underlined in the above example. In particular, is correct to 12 decimal places. We see that the number of correct digits after the decimal point increases from 2 (for ) to 5 and 10, illustrating the quadratic convergence.

===Slow convergence===
The function has a root at 0. Since is continuously differentiable at its root, the theory guarantees that Newton&#x27;s method as initialized sufficiently close to the root will converge. However, since the derivative is zero at the root, quadratic convergence is not ensured by the theory. In this particular example, the Newton iteration is given by
:formula_18
It is visible from this that Newton&#x27;s method could be initialized anywhere and converge to zero, but at only a linear rate. If initialized at 1, dozens of iterations would be required before ten digits of accuracy are achieved.

The function also has a root at 0, where it is continuously differentiable. Although the first derivative is nonzero at the root, the second derivative is nonexistent there, so that quadratic convergence cannot be guaranteed. In fact the Newton iteration is given by
:formula_19
From this, it can be seen that the rate of convergence is superlinear but subquadratic. This can be seen in the following tables, the left of which shows Newton&#x27;s method applied to the above and the right of which shows Newton&#x27;s method applied to . The quadratic convergence in iteration shown on the right is illustrated by the orders of magnitude in the distance from the iterate to the true root (0,1,2,3,5,10,20,39...) being approximately doubled from row to row. While the convergence on the left is superlinear, the order of magnitude is only multiplied by about 4/3 from row to row (0,1,2,4,5,7,10,13...).

The rate of convergence is distinguished from the number of iterations required to reach a given accuracy. For example, the function has a root at 1. Since and is smooth, it is known that any Newton iteration convergent to 1 will converge quadratically. However, if initialized at 0.5, the first few iterates of Newton&#x27;s method are approximately 26214, 24904, 23658, 22476, decreasing slowly, with only the 200th iterate being 1.0371. The following iterates are 1.0103, 1.00093, 1.0000082, and 1.00000000065, illustrating quadratic convergence. This highlights that quadratic convergence of a Newton iteration does not mean that only few iterates are required; this only applies once the sequence of iterates is sufficiently close to the root.

===Convergence dependent on initialization===
The function has a root at 0. The Newton iteration is given by
:formula_20
From this, it can be seen that there are three possible phenomena for a Newton iteration. If initialized strictly between , the Newton iteration will converge (super-)quadratically to 0; if initialized exactly at or , the Newton iteration will oscillate endlessly between ; if initialized anywhere else, the Newton iteration will diverge. This same trichotomy occurs for .

In cases where the function in question has multiple roots, it can be difficult to control, via choice of initialization, which root (if any) is identified by Newton&#x27;s method. For example, the function has roots at −1, 0, 1, and 3. If initialized at −1.488, the Newton iteration converges to 0; if initialized at −1.487, it diverges to ; if initialized at −1.486, it converges to −1; if initialized at −1.485, it diverges to ; if initialized at −1.4843, it converges to 3; if initialized at −1.484, it converges to . This kind of subtle dependence on initialization is not uncommon; it is frequently studied in the complex plane in the form of the Newton fractal.

===Divergence even when initialization is close to the root===

Consider the problem of finding a root of . The Newton iteration is
:formula_21
Unless Newton&#x27;s method is initialized at the exact root 0, it is seen that the sequence of iterates will fail to converge. For example, even if initialized at the reasonably accurate guess of 0.001, the first several iterates are −0.002, 0.004, −0.008, 0.016, reaching 1048.58, −2097.15, ... by the 20th iterate. This failure of convergence is not contradicted by the analytic theory, since in this case is not differentiable at its root.

In the above example, failure of convergence is reflected by the failure of to get closer to zero as increases, as well as by the fact that successive iterates are growing further and further apart. However, the function also has a root at 0. The Newton iteration is given by
:formula_22
In this example, where again is not differentiable at the root, any Newton iteration not starting exactly at the root will diverge, but with both and converging to zero. This is seen in the following table showing the iterates with initialization 1:
Although the convergence of in this case is not very rapid, it can be proved from the iteration formula. This example highlights the possibility that a stopping criterion for Newton&#x27;s method based only on the smallness of and might falsely identify a root.

===Oscillatory behavior===
It is easy to find situations for which Newton&#x27;s method oscillates endlessly between two distinct values. For example, for Newton&#x27;s method as applied to a function to oscillate between 0 and 1, it is only necessary that the tangent line to at 0 intersects the -axis at 1 and that the tangent line to at 1 intersects the -axis at 0. This is the case, for example, if . For this function, it is even the case that Newton&#x27;s iteration as initialized sufficiently close to 0 or 1 will &quot;asymptotically&quot; oscillate between these values. For example, Newton&#x27;s method as initialized at 0.99 yields iterates 0.99, −0.06317, 1.00628, 0.03651, 1.00196, 0.01162, 1.00020, 0.00120, 1.000002, and so on. This behavior is present despite the presence of a root of approximately equal to −1.76929.

===Undefinedness of Newton&#x27;s method===
In some cases, it is not even possible to perform the Newton iteration. For example, if , then the Newton iteration is defined by
:formula_23
So Newton&#x27;s method cannot be initialized at 0, since this would make undefined. Geometrically, this is because the tangent line to at 0 is horizontal (i.e. ), never intersecting the -axis.

Even if the initialization is selected so that the Newton iteration can begin, the same phenomenon can block the iteration from being indefinitely continued.

If has an incomplete domain, it is possible for Newton&#x27;s method to send the iterates outside of the domain, so that it is impossible to continue the iteration. For example, the natural logarithm function has a root at 1, and is defined only for positive . Newton&#x27;s iteration in this case is given by
:formula_24
So if the iteration is initialized at , the next iterate is 0; if the iteration is initialized at a value larger than , then the next iterate is negative. In either case, the method cannot be continued.

==Multidimensional formulations==
===Systems of equations===
==== variables, functions====
One may also use Newton&#x27;s method to solve systems of equations, which amounts to finding the (simultaneous) zeroes of continuously differentiable functions formula_25 This is equivalent to finding the zeroes of a single vector-valued function formula_26 In the formulation given above, the scalars are replaced by vectors and instead of dividing the function by its derivative one instead has to left multiply the function by the inverse of its Jacobian matrix . This results in the expression

formula_27

or, by solving the system of linear equations

formula_28

for the unknown .

==== variables, equations, with ====
The -dimensional variant of Newton&#x27;s method can be used to solve systems of greater than (nonlinear) equations as well if the algorithm uses the generalized inverse of the non-square Jacobian matrix instead of the inverse of . If the nonlinear system has no solution, the method attempts to find a solution in the non-linear least squares sense. See Gauss–Newton algorithm for more information.

==== Example ====
For example, the following set of equations needs to be solved for vector of points formula_29 given the vector of known values formula_30

formula_31

the function vector, formula_32 and Jacobian Matrix, formula_33 for iteration k, and the vector of known values, formula_34 are defined below.

formula_35

Note that formula_36 could have been rewritten to absorb formula_34 and thus eliminate formula_38 from the equations. The equation to solve for each iteration are

formula_39

and

formula_40

The iterations should be repeated until formula_41 where formula_42 is a value acceptably small enough to meet application requirements.

If vector formula_43 is initially chosen to be formula_44 that is, formula_45 and formula_46 and formula_47 is chosen to be 1., then the example converges after four iterations to a value of formula_48

==== Iterations ====
The following iterations were made during the course of the solution.

===Complex functions===
When dealing with complex functions, Newton&#x27;s method can be directly applied to find their zeroes. Each zero has a basin of attraction in the complex plane, the set of all starting values that cause the method to converge to that particular zero. These sets can be mapped as in the image shown. For many complex functions, the boundaries of the basins of attraction are fractals.

In some cases there are regions in the complex plane which are not in any of these basins of attraction, meaning the iterates do not converge. For example, if one uses a real initial condition to seek a root of , all subsequent iterates will be real numbers and so the iterations cannot converge to either root, since both roots are non-real. In this case almost all real initial conditions lead to chaotic behavior, while some initial conditions iterate either to infinity or to repeating cycles of any finite length.

Curt McMullen has shown that for any possible purely iterative algorithm similar to Newton&#x27;s method, the algorithm will diverge on some open regions of the complex plane when applied to some polynomial of degree 4 or higher. However, McMullen gave a generally convergent algorithm for polynomials of degree 3. Also, for any polynomial, Hubbard, Schleicher, and Sutherland gave a method for selecting a set of initial points such that Newton&#x27;s method will certainly converge at one of them at least.

===In a Banach space===
Another generalization is Newton&#x27;s method to find a root of a functional defined in a Banach space. In this case the formulation is

formula_49

where is the Fréchet derivative computed at . One needs the Fréchet derivative to be boundedly invertible at each in order for the method to be applicable. A condition for existence of and convergence to a root is given by the Newton–Kantorovich theorem.

====Nash–Moser iteration====

In the 1950s, John Nash developed a version of the Newton&#x27;s method to apply to the problem of constructing isometric embeddings of general Riemannian manifolds in Euclidean space. The &quot;loss of derivatives&quot; problem, present in this context, made the standard Newton iteration inapplicable, since it could not be continued indefinitely (much less converge). Nash&#x27;s solution involved the introduction of smoothing operators into the iteration. He was able to prove the convergence of his smoothed Newton method, for the purpose of proving an implicit function theorem for isometric embeddings. In the 1960s, Jürgen Moser showed that Nash&#x27;s methods were flexible enough to apply to problems beyond isometric embedding, particularly in celestial mechanics. Since then, a number of mathematicians, including Mikhael Gromov and Richard Hamilton, have found generalized abstract versions of the Nash–Moser theory. In Hamilton&#x27;s formulation, the Nash–Moser theorem forms a generalization of the Banach space Newton method which takes place in certain Fréchet spaces.

==Modifications==
===Quasi-Newton methods===
When the Jacobian is unavailable or too expensive to compute at every iteration, a quasi-Newton method can be used.

===Chebyshev&#x27;s third-order method===

===Over -adic numbers===
In -adic analysis, the standard method to show a polynomial equation in one variable has a -adic root is Hensel&#x27;s lemma, which uses the recursion from Newton&#x27;s method on the -adic numbers. Because of the more stable behavior of addition and multiplication in the -adic numbers compared to the real numbers (specifically, the unit ball in the -adics is a ring), convergence in Hensel&#x27;s lemma can be guaranteed under much simpler hypotheses than in the classical Newton&#x27;s method on the real line.

===-analog===
Newton&#x27;s method can be generalized with the -analog of the usual derivative.

===Modified Newton methods===
====Maehly&#x27;s procedure====
A nonlinear equation has multiple solutions in general. But if the initial value is not appropriate, Newton&#x27;s method may not converge to the desired solution or may converge to the same solution found earlier. When we have already found solutions of formula_50, then the next root can be found by applying Newton&#x27;s method to the next equation:

formula_51

This method is applied to obtain zeros of the Bessel function of the second kind.

====Hirano&#x27;s modified Newton method====
Hirano&#x27;s modified Newton method is a modification conserving the convergence of Newton method and avoiding unstableness. It is developed to solve complex polynomials.

====Interval Newton&#x27;s method====

Combining Newton&#x27;s method with interval arithmetic is very useful in some contexts. This provides a stopping criterion that is more reliable than the usual ones (which are a small value of the function or a small variation of the variable between consecutive iterations). Also, this may detect cases where Newton&#x27;s method converges theoretically but diverges numerically because of an insufficient floating-point precision (this is typically the case for polynomials of large degree, where a very small change of the variable may change dramatically the value of the function; see Wilkinson&#x27;s polynomial).

Consider , where is a real interval, and suppose that we have an interval extension of , meaning that takes as input an interval and outputs an interval such that:

formula_52

We also assume that , so in particular has at most one root in .
We then define the interval Newton operator by:

formula_53

where . Note that the hypothesis on implies that is well defined and is an interval (see interval arithmetic for further details on interval operations). This naturally leads to the following sequence:

formula_54

The mean value theorem ensures that if there is a root of in , then it is also in . Moreover, the hypothesis on ensures that is at most half the size of when is the midpoint of , so this sequence converges towards , where is the root of in .

If strictly contains 0, the use of extended interval division produces a union of two intervals for ; multiple roots are therefore automatically separated and bounded.

==Applications==
===Minimization and maximization problems===

Newton&#x27;s method can be used to find a minimum or maximum of a function . The derivative is zero at a minimum or maximum, so local minima and maxima can be found by applying Newton&#x27;s method to the derivative. The iteration becomes:

formula_55

===Multiplicative inverses of numbers and power series===
An important application is Newton–Raphson division, which can be used to quickly find the reciprocal of a number , using only multiplication and subtraction, that is to say the number such that . We can rephrase that as finding the zero of . We have .

Newton&#x27;s iteration is

formula_56

Therefore, Newton&#x27;s iteration needs only two multiplications and one subtraction.

This method is also very efficient to compute the multiplicative inverse of a power series.

===Solving transcendental equations===
Many transcendental equations can be solved up to an arbitrary precision by using Newton&#x27;s method. For example, finding the cumulative probability density function, such as a Normal distribution to fit a known probability generally involves integral functions with no known means to solve in closed form. However, computing the derivatives needed to solve them numerically with Newton&#x27;s method is generally known, making numerical solutions possible. For an example, see the numerical solution to the inverse Normal cumulative distribution.

===Numerical verification for solutions of nonlinear equations===
A numerical verification for solutions of nonlinear equations has been established by using Newton&#x27;s method multiple times and forming a set of solution candidates.

==Code==
The following is an example of a possible implementation of Newton&#x27;s method in the Python (version 3.x) programming language for finding a root of a function codice_1 which has derivative codice_2.

The initial guess will be and the function will be so that .

Each new iteration of Newton&#x27;s method will be denoted by codice_3. We will check during the computation whether the denominator (codice_4) becomes too small (smaller than codice_5), which would be the case if , since otherwise a large amount of error could be introduced.
def f(x): 
 return x**2 - 2 # f(x) = x^2 - 2

def f_prime(x):
 return 2*x # f&#x27;(x) = 2x

def newtons_method(x0, f, f_prime, tolerance, epsilon, max_iterations):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Newton&#x27;s method

 Args:
 x0: The initial guess
 f: The function whose root we are trying to find
 f_prime: The derivative of the function

 for _ in range(max_iterations):
 y = f(x0)
 yprime = f_prime(x0)

 break

 x1 = x0 - y / yprime # Do Newton&#x27;s computation

 if abs(x1 - x0) &lt;= tolerance: # Stop when the result is within the desired tolerance
 return x1 # x1 is a solution within tolerance and maximum number of iterations

 x0 = x1 # Update x0 to start the process again

 return None # Newton&#x27;s method did not converge

<text>New Order are an English rock band formed in Salford in 1980 by vocalist and guitarist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook, and drummer Stephen Morris. Their fusion of post-punk, electronic and dance music made them one of the most acclaimed and influential bands of the 1980s. The band formed after their previous band, Joy Division, disbanded following the suicide of lead singer Ian Curtis. Keyboardist Gillian Gilbert joined them later that year. They became the flagship band for Manchester-based independent record label Factory Records and its nightclub, The Haçienda. They worked in long-term collaboration with graphic designer Peter Saville for their album covers.

While the band&#x27;s early years were overshadowed by the legacy of Joy Division, their experience in the early 1980s New York club scene saw them increasingly incorporate dance rhythms and electronic instrumentation into their work. Their 1983 hit &quot;Blue Monday&quot; became the best-selling 12-inch single of all time and a popular club track. In the 1980s, they released successful albums such as &quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot; (1983), &quot;Technique&quot; (1989), and the singles compilation &quot;Substance&quot; (1987). They disbanded in 1993 to work on individual projects before reuniting in 1998. In the years since then, New Order have gone through various hiatuses and changes of personnel, most prominently the departure of Hook in 2007 due to personal disputes with the other members. In 2015, they released their tenth studio album, &quot;Music Complete.&quot; In 2023, both Joy Division and New Order were nominated as one act for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==History==
===Origins and formation: 1977–1980===

Between 1977 and 1980, Ian Curtis, Peter Hook, Stephen Morris, and Bernard Sumner were members of the post-punk band Joy Division, often featuring heavy production input from producer Martin Hannett. Curtis died by suicide on 18 May 1980, the day before Joy Division were scheduled to depart for their first American tour, and before the release of the band&#x27;s sophomore album, &quot;Closer&quot;.

After Curtis&#x27;s death, the rest of the band decided to continue without him. The group chose to perform under a different name as, before Curtis died, the group had decided not to use &quot;Joy Division&quot; as their name in the event of departure of any member. During the summer of 1980, the remaining three members recorded their first demos, including a track called &quot;Haystack&quot; with vocalist Kevin Hewick, whom Tony Wilson had suggested to be considered as the band&#x27;s new front man. On 29 July 1980, the still unnamed trio debuted live at Manchester&#x27;s Beach Club. Rob Gretton, the band&#x27;s manager for over twenty years, is credited with having found the name New Order in an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; titled &quot;The New Order of Kampuchean Rebels&quot;. Having also considered the name The Witch Doctors of Zimbabwe, the band opted for The New Order of Kampuchean Rebels, which was narrowed down to the name New Order, despite its previous use for former Stooge Ron Asheton&#x27;s band The New Order. The group emphasized that the name New Order, as was also the case with &quot;Joy Division,&quot; did not draw a direct line to Nazism or fascism.

New Order embarked on a short US tour in early Autumn 1980. In these shows Sumner, Morris and Hook all sang lead vocals on different tracks. Sumner ultimately took the role as front man, although he was unable to perform vocals while playing guitar. During this tour, the band recorded two tracks written by Joy Division: &quot;Ceremony&quot; and &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot;, which were released as New Order&#x27;s debut single in January 1981.

The band wanted to complete the line-up with someone they knew well, and whose musical skill and style was compatible with their own. Gretton suggested Morris&#x27;s girlfriend Gillian Gilbert, and she was invited to join the band in early October 1980 as keyboardist and guitarist. Her first live performance with the band took place at The Squat in Manchester on 25 October 1980. As a quartet, New Order subsequently re-recorded &quot;Ceremony,&quot; which was released as a twelve-inch single in September 1981.

===&quot;Movement&quot;: 1981–1982===
New Order&#x27;s first commercial release was the single &quot;Ceremony&quot;, backed with &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot;. These two songs were written in the weeks before Curtis took his own life. With the release of &quot;Movement&quot; in November 1981, New Order initially started on a similar route as their previous incarnation, performing dark, melodic songs, albeit with an increased use of synthesizers. The band viewed the period as a low point, as they were still reeling from Curtis&#x27; death. Hook commented that the only positive thing to come out of the &quot;Movement&quot; sessions was that producer Martin Hannett had showed the band how to use a mixing board, which allowed them to produce records by themselves from then on. More recently, Hook indicated a change of heart: &quot;I think &quot;Movement&quot; gets a raw deal in general really—for me, when you consider the circumstances in which it was written, it is a fantastic record.&quot;

New Order visited New York City again in 1981, where the band were introduced to post-disco, freestyle, and electro. The band had taken to listening to Italian disco to cheer themselves up, while Morris taught himself drum programming. The singles that followed, &quot;Everything&#x27;s Gone Green&quot; and &quot;Temptation&quot;, saw a change in direction toward dance music and departure of producer Martin Hannett, when he walked off halfway through the mix of &quot;Everything&#x27;s Gone Green&quot; leading to the band producing &quot;Temptation&quot; by themselves.

The Haçienda, Factory Records&#x27; own nightclub (largely funded by New Order) opened in May 1982 in Manchester and was even issued a Factory catalogue number: FAC51. The opening of UK&#x27;s first ever superclub was marked by a nearly 23-minute instrumental piece originally entitled &quot;Prime 5 8 6&quot;, but released 15 years later as &quot;Video 5 8 6&quot;. Composed primarily by Sumner and Morris, &quot;Prime 5 8 6&quot;/&quot;Video 5 8 6&quot; was an early version of &quot;5 8 6&quot; that contained rhythm elements that would later surface on &quot;Blue Monday&quot; and &quot;Ultraviolence&quot;.

===&quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot;: 1983–1984===

&quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot; was released in May 1983. This synth-pop album incorporated some the post-punk style of sound from their previous band, Joy Division and their first album Movement. The members of the band had been hinting at the increased use of technology during the music-making process for a number of years then, including their work as Joy Division. Starting from what earlier singles had hinted, this was where the band found their footing, mixing early techno music with their earlier guitar-based sound and showing the strong influence of acts like Kraftwerk and Giorgio Moroder. Even further in this direction was the electronically sequenced, four-on-the-floor single &quot;Blue Monday&quot;. Inspired by Klein + M.B.O.&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Talk&quot; and Sylvester&#x27;s disco classic, &quot;You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)&quot;, &quot;Blue Monday&quot; became the best-selling independent 12&quot; single of all time in the UK; however, it was not on the track list of &quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot;. The song was included however on the cassette format in some countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, and on the original North American CD release of the album, alongside its B-side, &quot;The Beach&quot;. &quot;Blue Monday&quot; was also included on the 2008 collector&#x27;s edition of &quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot;.

The 1983 single &quot;Confusion&quot; firmly established the group as a dance music force, inspiring many musicians in subsequent years. In 1984 they followed the largely synthesized single &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot; with the heavy guitar-drum-bass rumble of &quot;Murder&quot;, a not-too-distant cousin of &quot;Ecstasy&quot; from the &quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot; album. KROQ Los Angeles DJ Jed the Fish claims New Order had more to do with the emergence of house music than the Warehouse music of Chicago and &quot;Frankie Knuckles and the whole so-called House music scene. Unless you were actually from regional Chicago, had you ever heard of House music until New Order? Be real, now.&quot;

In 1983, DJ Producer Norman &quot;Chris&quot; Jester (Jester Productions / DJ Dizzo) brought a new energy to Blue Monday and in conjunction with Swedish Egil (KROQ), produced and released the New Order &quot;Counting Flowers&quot; Remix. Taking the masters back into the studio and re-engineering the synths and bass-line, he created this popular 12&quot; club version. The new club mix version was first premiered at Phases nightclub in Canoga Park, California where he was one of the resident DJs. On the radio side, the new version was premiered that same night on KROQ&#x27;s Dance Party Weekend with Swedish Egil.

===&quot;Low-Life&quot;, &quot;Brotherhood&quot;, and &quot;Substance&quot;: 1985–1987===

Released in 1985, &quot;Low-Life&quot; refined and sometimes mixed the two styles, guitar-based and electronic, and included &quot;The Perfect Kiss&quot; – the video for which was filmed by Jonathan Demme – and &quot;Sub-culture&quot;. In February 1986, the soundtrack album to &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; featuring &quot;Shellshock&quot; was released on A&amp;M Records. An instrumental version of &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Elegia&quot; appeared in the film but were not on the soundtrack album. Later that summer, New Order headlined a line-up that included the Smiths, the Fall, and A Certain Ratio during the Festival of the Tenth Summer at Manchester&#x27;s G-Mex.

&quot;Brotherhood&quot; (1986) divided the two approaches onto separate album sides. The album notably featured &quot;Bizarre Love Triangle&quot; (a Top 20 hit in Australia and New Zealand) and &quot;Angel Dust&quot; (of which a remixed instrumental version is available on the UK &quot;True Faith&quot; CD video single, under the title &quot;Evil Dust&quot;), a track which marries a synth break beat with &quot;Low-Life&quot;-era guitar effects. While New Order toured North America with friends Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, the summer of 1987 saw the release of the compilation &quot;Substance&quot;, which featured the new single &quot;True Faith&quot;. &quot;Substance&quot; was an important album in collecting the group&#x27;s 12-inch singles onto CD for the first time and featured new versions of &quot;Temptation&quot; and &quot;Confusion&quot;—referred to as &quot;Temptation &#x27;87&quot; and &quot;Confusion &#x27;87&quot;. A second disc featured several of the B-sides from the singles on the first disc, as well as additional A-sides &quot;Procession&quot; and &quot;Murder&quot;. The single, &quot;True Faith&quot;, with its surreal video, became a hit on MTV and the band&#x27;s first American top 40 hit. The single&#x27;s B-side, &quot;1963&quot;—originally planned on being the A-side until the group&#x27;s label convinced them to release &quot;True Faith&quot; instead—would later be released as a single in its own right several years later, with two new versions.

In December 1987, the band released a further single, &quot;Touched by the Hand of God&quot;, with a Kathryn Bigelow-directed video parodying glam-metal. The song was one of four new tracks recorded for the American comedy film &quot;Salvation!&quot;, and reached number 20 on the UK Singles Chart and number 1 in the UK Independent Singles chart. However, it would not appear on an album until the 1994 compilation &quot;The Best of New Order&quot;.

===&quot;Technique&quot;, &quot;Republic&quot; and first break-up: 1988–1993===
By this time, the group was heavily influenced by the Balearic sounds of Ibiza, which were making their way into the Haçienda. Partly recorded at Mediterranean Sound studios on Ibiza, &quot;Technique&quot; was released in February 1989. The album entered the charts at number one in the UK and contained a mix of acid house influence (as on opening track &quot;Fine Time&quot;) and a more traditional rock sound (as on the single &quot;Run 2&quot;). The album is a blend of upbeat, accessible music coupled with blunt, poignant lyrics. During the summer of 1989, New Order supported &quot;Technique&quot; by touring with Public Image Ltd, Throwing Muses and the Sugarcubes across the United States and Canada in what the press dubbed the &quot;Monsters of Alternative Rock&quot; tour. Around this time, band members also began side projects including Electronic (Sumner with Johnny Marr) and Revenge (Hook with Davyth Hicks). Morris and Gilbert began to work together on outside TV theme production work. In 1991, the band were sued by the publishing company of American singer John Denver, who alleged that the guitar break in &quot;Run 2&quot; was similar to his song &quot;Leaving on a Jet Plane&quot;. The case was settled out of court and the song has since been credited to both New Order and John Denver.

In 1990, New Order recorded the official song of the England national football team&#x27;s 1990 World Cup campaign, &quot;World in Motion&quot;, under the ad hoc band name EnglandNewOrder. The song, co-written with comedian Keith Allen, was the band&#x27;s sole number one UK hit. The song was originally planned to be titled &quot;E for England&quot;, however the Football Association vetoed the title upon realizing that this was a reference to ecstasy; a drug heavily associated with the Haçienda. (Allen claimed that his original draft lyrics included &quot;E is for England, England starts with E / We&#x27;ll all be smiling when we&#x27;re in Italy.&quot;) The song also featured chanting from members of the England team and Allen, and a guest rap from England player John Barnes. It was again produced by Stephen Hague, who the band chose to produce their next album.

The band&#x27;s next album &quot;Republic&quot; was shadowed by the collapse of their longtime label Factory Records. In 1992, The label had been ailing due to financial difficulties, and was forced to declare bankruptcy. New Order never had a formal contract with Factory. Although unusual for a major group, this was Factory&#x27;s standard practice until the mid-1980s. Because of this, the band, rather than Factory Records, legally owned all of their recordings. This has been cited by Wilson himself as the main reason London Records&#x27; 1992 offer to buy the ailing label fell through. Following Factory&#x27;s collapse, New Order signed with London, as did Morris and Gilbert separately for their side project The Other Two, whose debut album was originally intended for release on Factory. &quot;Republic&quot;, released around the world in 1993, spawned the singles &quot;Regret&quot;—New Order&#x27;s highest-charting single in the US—&quot;Ruined in a Day&quot;, &quot;World&quot;, and &quot;Spooky&quot;.

Following the release and promotion of &quot;Republic&quot;, the band put New Order on hold while focusing on side projects; with The Other Two&#x27;s debut album released in 1993. In 1994, a second singles collection was released, entitled &quot;The Best of New Order&quot;. It featured all of the band&#x27;s singles since &quot;Substance&quot; as well as a few extra tracks: &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; (from 1989&#x27;s &quot;Technique&quot;), &quot;The Perfect Kiss&quot;, &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot;, &quot;Shellshock&quot;, and remixes of &quot;True Faith&quot;, &quot;Bizarre Love Triangle&quot;, &quot;1963&quot;, and &quot;Round &amp; Round&quot;. The new versions of &quot;True Faith&quot; and &quot;1963&quot; (the latter as a more guitar-oriented version produced by Arthur Baker) were released as singles to promote the album. In the US, the track listing was altered to set it apart from &quot;Substance&quot; as well as the UK release of &quot;The Best of New Order&quot; which had been available months prior. This collection was followed by a remix album, &quot;The Rest of New Order&quot;, featuring a selection of existing and newly commissioned mixes of classic New Order tracks. Some versions contained an extra disc or cassette composed entirely of remixes of &quot;Blue Monday&quot;. &quot;Blue Monday&quot; was released as a single for a third time to promote the collection.

===Reformation and &quot;Get Ready&quot;: 1998–2003===
The group reconvened in 1998 at the suggestion of Rob Gretton. Nearly five years had passed since they had last seen each other. Sumner said, &quot;We decided before we agreed to doing any gig, to have a meeting, and if anyone had any grudges to bear, to iron them out.&quot; By the second meeting everyone agreed to continue playing, scheduling their reunion gig for the Phoenix Festival that same year. In addition to rarer songs, New Order also decided to begin playing Joy Division songs again. When the Phoenix Festival was cancelled due to low ticket sales, New Order instead played the last night of that year&#x27;s Reading Festival.

Their 2001 release &quot;Get Ready&quot; largely departed from their more electronic style and focused on more guitar oriented music. According to Sumner, &quot;&quot;Get Ready&quot; was guitar-heavy simply because we felt that we&#x27;d left that instrument alone for a long time.&quot; Longtime fan Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins played guitar and sang back-up on the track &quot;Turn My Way,&quot; and in 2001 toured with the band on dates in the UK, US, and Japan for a short period of time. Phil Cunningham (formerly of Marion) joined the band in a live capacity, deputizing for Gilbert who declined to tour in favor of caring for her and Morris&#x27; children. Primal Scream&#x27;s Bobby Gillespie provided vocals on the track &quot;Rock the Shack&quot;. Singles from the album included &quot;Crystal,&quot; &quot;60 Miles an Hour&quot; and Someone Like You.&quot;

In 2002, &quot;Q&quot; featured New Order on their list of the &quot;50 Bands to See Before You Die&quot;, although this was as part of a sub-list of &quot;5 Bands That Could Go Either Way&quot;. Both New Order and Joy Division were portrayed in the Michael Winterbottom film &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot;, depicting the rise and fall of Factory Records as seen through the eyes of label founder Tony Wilson. Cameos by Wilson himself, along with Mark E. Smith of the Fall and former members of Happy Mondays and Inspiral Carpets, lent a degree of legitimacy to the proceedings. The film touched on some of Factory&#x27;s other artists, including Happy Mondays and the Durutti Column. The soundtrack featured the new track &quot;Here to Stay,&quot; produced by the Chemical Brothers, which was released as a single. The single&#x27;s music video highlighted scenes taken from the film.

===&quot;Waiting for the Sirens&#x27; Call&quot;, &quot;Singles&quot; and second break-up: 2004–2007===

The band released a new album on 27 March 2005, titled &quot;Waiting for the Sirens&#x27; Call&quot;, their first with new member Phil Cunningham. Cunningham replaced Gilbert (now married to Morris) so she could look after their children. Singles from this album were &quot;Krafty&quot;, &quot;Jetstream&quot; (which features guest vocals by Ana Matronic from Scissor Sisters), and the title track. At the 2005 NME Awards, New Order and Joy Division received the award for &quot;Godlike Geniuses&quot; (for lifetime achievement). Previous winners include Ozzy Osbourne, the Clash, and Happy Mondays. In 2006 the album track &quot;Guilt Is a Useless Emotion&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Dance Recording.

In the autumn of 2005, the group released another greatest hits compilation, in the form of &quot;Singles&quot;. The two-disc release was an updated version of the &quot;Substance&quot; collection and contained every single released from their 1981 debut all the way through to &quot;Waiting for the Sirens&#x27; Call&quot;. However, unlike &quot;Substance&quot;, which focused almost exclusively on the 12&quot; versions of the group&#x27;s singles, &quot;Singles&quot; collected the 7&quot; versions, many of which (like &quot;Ceremony&quot;, &quot;Temptation&quot; and &quot;Confusion&quot;) had never been released on CD. The album was accompanied by a two-disc DVD set, titled &quot;Item&quot;, that collected the extended UK version of &quot;NewOrderStory&quot; with a DVD of all New Order music videos as well as two newly commissioned videos for &quot;Temptation &#x27;87&quot; and &quot;Ceremony&quot;.

The &quot;New Order: Live in Glasgow&quot; DVD was recorded at the Glasgow Academy in 2006 and features 18 tracks, including 4 Joy Division songs. Next to that, the release also contains a bonus disc of footage from the band&#x27;s personal archive including 1980s footage from Glastonbury (June 1981), Rome, Cork, Rotterdam and Toronto.

In 2006, the band played several one-off live dates as well as short tours in the UK, Brazil and Argentina. After their Buenos Aires show in November 2006, Peter Hook suggested that the band should stop touring. In early May 2007, Hook was interviewed by British radio station XFM—originally to talk about his contribution to the debut album of Jane&#x27;s Addiction singer Perry Farrell&#x27;s new band Satellite Party—and stated that &quot;Me and Bernard aren&#x27;t working together.&quot; Further complicating the news, NewOrderOnline, a website with support from New Order management, reported that according to &quot;a source close to the band&quot;, &quot;The news about the split is false... New Order still exists despite what [Hook] said ... Peter Hook can leave the band, but this doesn&#x27;t mean the end of New Order.&quot; However, Sumner revealed in 2009 that he no longer wished to make music as New Order.

===Reunion with new line-up, &quot;Lost Sirens&quot; and &quot;Music Complete&quot;: 2011–2016===
In September 2011, the band announced that they would perform for the first time since 2006, at the Ancienne Belgique, Brussels on 17 October and at the Bataclan, Paris on 18 October. The band&#x27;s line-up included keyboardist Gillian Gilbert, who returned to the band after a ten-year break, and Bad Lieutenant bassist Tom Chapman in place of Peter Hook. They played subsequent shows in London and South America in December, and released &quot;Live at the London Troxy&quot;, a live album from their performance on 10 December 2011 at The Troxy in London.
They continued to tour throughout 2012, including a short tour of New Zealand and Australia in February/March, and several festival appearances in 2012. New Order performed at Hyde Park with Blur and the Specials to celebrate the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.

&quot;Lost Sirens&quot; was released in the United Kingdom in January 2013. &quot;Lost Sirens&quot; is an eight-track album of songs recorded during the sessions for &quot;Waiting for the Sirens&#x27; Call&quot;. The album was discussed by Gillian Gilbert in a Brazilian interview to promote the band&#x27;s appearance in São Paulo. She acknowledged issues with former member Peter Hook, and stated there was &quot;a lot going on behind the scenes on the copyright&quot; delaying the release.

The band debuted their first new song since the &quot;Waiting for the Sirens&#x27; Call&quot; sessions, &quot;Singularity&quot;, during Lollapalooza Chile in March 2014. In July, the group toured North America, where they debuted another song, &quot;Plastic&quot;. On 2 September the band signed to Mute Records. The New Order back catalogue remains with Warner Music.

In September 2015, the band released a new album, &quot;Music Complete&quot;, their first without Peter Hook. The album was produced mostly by the band themselves, except &quot;Singularity&quot; and &quot;Unlearn This Hatred&quot;, both produced by Tom Rowlands, while &quot;Superheated&quot; features additional production by Stuart Price.

In May 2016, New Order released a follow-up remix album &quot;Complete Music&quot;, which consists of extended and reworked mixes of each track from &quot;Music Complete&quot;.

In November 2015, Peter Hook sued Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert. In an objection, it was revealed that Sumner, Morris and Gilbert had set up a new company behind Hook&#x27;s back, which generated an income of £7.8 million in four years, while Hook received only a fraction of that sum. The three members argued they had treated Hook fairly and that his stake in the band&#x27;s royalties was reasonable, despite the fact that in four years, Hook had only received &quot;1.25 per cent of the band&#x27;s royalties and other income from merchandising and performances&quot;. The judge ruled that there was &quot;at least a reasonable prospect&quot; of Hook proving that he was not getting a fair share of royalties and other income and rejected Sumner and Morris&#x27;s lawyer&#x27;s argument. The judge was willing to hear the case but urged the parties to come to an agreement rather than suffer legal costs of around £900,000. On 20 September 2017, the band announced that a full and final settlement had been reached in the dispute.

===Touring and recent work: 2017–present===
On 13 July 2017, New Order played a concert at Manchester International Festival with Liam Gillick. In July 2019 the performance was released as a live album titled &quot;Σ(No,12k,Lg,17Mif) New Order + Liam Gillick: So it goes.. (Live at MIF)&quot;. The collaboration between Gillick and New Order was the subject of the documentary feature &quot;New Order: Decades&quot;, directed by Mike Christie and broadcast in the UK by Sky Arts and Showtime in the US.

On August 23, 2018, the band kicked off their North American tour at the Palace Theatre in St. Paul, Minnesota, with stops in Cleveland, Washington, D.C., Toronto, Long Beach, and Hawaii. In November, they also performed in Santiago, Chile.

In January 2020, the band played a four night residency at The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater in Miami Beach, Florida, and in February 2020, they announced a co-headlining tour in North America with the Pet Shop Boys, and that the only concert in the UK in 2020 would be at The O2 on 10 October. These tour dates were later rescheduled for 2021.

In September 2020 the band released the single &quot;Be a Rebel&quot; 5 years after their previous release. A music video for the single, directed by NYSU, premiered on YouTube in December.

In February 2021, the band announced their plans to release a live album and concert film of their 2018 show at London&#x27;s Alexandra Palace, directed by Mike Christie. Entitled &quot;Education Entertainment Recreation (Live at Alexandra Palace)&quot;, it was released on 7 May.

New Order kicked off their Unity Tour (with the Pet Shop Boys) on 17 September 2022. The tour consisted of 13 dates in the United States and Canada.

New Order kicked off their 2023 UK and European tour on 21 September 2023.

==Other projects==

In 1988, Bernard Sumner teamed up with former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr to form the group Electronic, also enlisting the help of Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe of the Pet Shop Boys. Electronic regrouped in 1996 for &quot;Raise the Pressure&quot;, which also featured Karl Bartos (formerly of Kraftwerk). The project&#x27;s third album &quot;Twisted Tenderness&quot; was released in 1999 after which the band dissolved.

In June 2009, Sumner formed a new band called Bad Lieutenant with Phil Cunningham (guitar) and Jake Evans (guitar and vocals). Their album &quot;Never Cry Another Tear&quot; was released on 5 October 2009. In addition to Cunningham and Evans, the album also features appearances by Stephen Morris (drums), Jack Mitchell (drums), Tom Chapman (bass) and Alex James (bass). The live band included Morris on drums and Tom Chapman on bass.

Peter Hook has been involved with several other projects. In the 1990s, Hook recorded with Killing Joke with a view to joining the band. However, original bassist Martin &#x27;Youth&#x27; Glover instead returned to the band. In 1995, he toured with the Durutti Column. He has recorded one album with the band Revenge with Davyth Hicks and Chris Jones and two with Monaco (both as bassist, keyboardist and lead vocalist) with David Potts. Monaco scored a club and alternative radio hit with &quot;What Do You Want From Me?&quot; in 1997. Hook also formed a band called Freebass with fellow bass players Mani (the Stone Roses) and Andy Rourke (the Smiths) in addition to vocalist Gary Briggs. &quot;Freebass&quot; was active from 2007 to 2010. He also contributed to Perry Farrell&#x27;s Satellite Party. Hook&#x27;s current band Peter Hook and the Light is touring and performing full albums from both Joy Division and New Order.

In 1990, Gillian Gilbert and Stephen Morris formed their own band, The Other Two. The Other Two released its first single &quot;Tasty Fish&quot; in 1991 and released two albums, &quot;The Other Two &amp; You&quot; in 1993 and &quot;Super Highways&quot; in 1999. They have also been involved in scoring television soundtracks, like &quot;Making Out&quot;. In 2007, Gilbert and Morris remixed two tracks for the Nine Inch Nails remixes album &quot;Year Zero Remixed&quot;.

===BeMusic===
&quot;BeMusic&quot; was a name the band used for their publishing company (the LP label for &quot;Movement&quot; says &quot;B Music&quot; in large letters, though using an italic ß for the letter B). All four members of the band used the name for production work for other artists&#x27; recordings between 1982 and 1985.

The first BeMusic credit was for Peter Hook producing Stockholm Monsters in 1982. Other artists with producer or musician credit for &quot;BeMusic&quot; were 52nd Street, Section 25, Marcel King, Quando Quango, Paul Haig, Thick Pigeon, Nyam Nyam, and Life.

Their production work as BeMusic was collected on two LTM Recordings compilation CDs, &quot;Cool As Ice: The BeMusic Productions&quot; and &quot;Twice As Nice&quot; (which also included production work by Donald Johnson, of A Certain Ratio, and Arthur Baker).

==Influences and style==

Some of New Order&#x27;s tracks, such as 1982&#x27;s &quot;Temptation&quot;, 1983&#x27;s &quot;Blue Monday&quot; and 1987&#x27;s &quot;True Faith&quot; can be observed blending genres of rock and dance. According to a staff-written AllMusic history, the band are regarded as &quot;the first alternative dance&quot; music group, having &quot;fused icy, gloomy post-punk with Kraftwerk-style synth-pop&quot;. They have also been labelled as synth-pop, post-punk, alternative rock, new wave, dance-rock, electronic rock, and electronica.

Founding member Hook stated that the band&#x27;s shift from playing cold, dark tracks from 1981 to producing electro/rock tracks from 1982 was inspired by the music of German electronic group Kraftwerk, the Giorgio Moroder/Donna Summer collaboration on &quot;I Feel Love&quot;, and the US rock band Sparks who had produced disco/electro-rock music with Moroder on their &quot;No. 1 in Heaven&quot; album. New Order&#x27;s Kraftwerk influence was acknowledged by their single &quot;Krafty&quot;, which had cover art referencing &quot;Autobahn&quot;.

Along with Kraftwerk, the English bands Cabaret Voltaire, the Human League, and OMD educated frontman Bernard Sumner that one &quot;could make music without guitars&quot;. New Order&#x27;s collaboration with New York DJ Arthur Baker was inspired by the records&#x27; sounds of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five and Afrika Bambaataa &amp; the Soulsonic Force. Other influences include David Bowie and Neu!.

Drummer Stephen Morris plays a mixture of acoustic and electronic drums, but all the band members could and did switch instruments throughout gigs, as evidenced on Jonathan Demme&#x27;s video for &quot;The Perfect Kiss&quot; and the concert videos &quot;Taras Shevchenko&quot; (recorded in New York, November 1981) and &quot;Pumped Full of Drugs&quot; (Tokyo, May 1985). During such live gigs, Sumner alternated between guitar, keyboards, melodica, cowbell and (on the track &quot;Confusion&quot;) bass; Gilbert switched between keyboards and guitar, Morris between drums and keyboards, and Hook played both bass and electronic drums. During their early performances, the members were known to leave the stage before the final song &quot;Temptation&quot; had concluded, allowing sequencers and drum machines to finish the track.

===Cover artwork===
Almost all New Order recordings have distinctive packaging and Peter Saville was the art director. The group&#x27;s record sleeves bucked the 1980s trend by rarely showing the band members (with the exception of the &quot;Low-Life&quot; album) or even providing basic information such as the band name or title of the release. Song names were often hidden within the shrink wrapped package, either on the disc itself (such as the &quot;Blue Monday&quot; single), on an inconspicuous part of an inner sleeve (&quot;The Perfect Kiss&quot; single), or written in a cryptic color code invented by Saville (&quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot;). Saville said his intention was to sell the band as a &quot;mass-produced secret&quot; of sorts, and that the minimalist style was enough to allow fans to identify the band&#x27;s products without explicit labeling. He frequently sent the artwork straight to the printer, without review by either the band or the label. Their 1983 album, &quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot;, was one of ten classic album covers from British artists commemorated on a UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail.

==Legacy==
The band have influenced techno, rock, and pop musicians including Moby, the Killers, and the xx. Numerous covers of their songs have been released, notably Orgy&#x27;s Blue Monday, as well as several tribute albums.

=== Reputation ===
Both New Order and Joy Division were among the most successful artists on the Factory Records label, which was run by Granada television personality Tony Wilson, and partnered with Factory in the financing of the Manchester club The Haçienda. Speaking in 2009, fellow synth-pop musician Phil Oakey described New Order&#x27;s slow-burn career as cult musicians as being unusually prolonged and effective: &quot;If you want to make a lot of money out of pop, be number 3 a lot. Like New Order did.&quot;

<text>Nicolo, known as Tartaglia (; 1499/1500 – 13 December 1557), was an Italian mathematician, engineer (designing fortifications), a surveyor (of topography, seeking the best means of defense or offense) and a bookkeeper from the then Republic of Venice. He published many books, including the first Italian translations of Archimedes and Euclid, and an acclaimed compilation of mathematics. Tartaglia was the first to apply mathematics to the investigation of the paths of cannonballs, known as ballistics, in his &quot;Nova Scientia&quot; (&quot;A New Science&quot;, 1537); his work was later partially validated and partially superseded by Galileo&#x27;s studies on falling bodies. He also published a treatise on retrieving sunken ships.

==Personal life==
Nicolo was born in Brescia, the son of Michele, a dispatch rider who travelled to neighbouring towns to deliver mail. In 1506, Michele was murdered by robbers, and Nicolo, his two siblings, and his mother were left impoverished. Nicolo experienced further tragedy in 1512 when King Louis XII&#x27;s troops invaded Brescia during the War of the League of Cambrai against Venice. The militia of Brescia defended their city for seven days. When the French finally broke through, they took their revenge by massacring the inhabitants of Brescia. By the end of battle, over 45,000 residents were killed. During the massacre, Nicolo and his family sought sanctuary in the local cathedral. But the French entered and a soldier sliced Nicolo&#x27;s jaw and palate with a saber and left him for dead. His mother nursed him back to health but the young boy was left with a speech impediment, prompting the nickname &quot;Tartaglia&quot; (&quot;stammerer&quot;). After this he would never shave, and grew a beard to camouflage his scars.

His surname at birth, if any, is disputed. Some sources have him as &quot;Niccolò Fontana&quot;, but others claim that the only support for this is a will in which he named a brother, Zuampiero Fontana, as heir, and point out that this does not imply he had the same surname. 

Tartaglia&#x27;s biographer Arnoldo Masotti writes that:

Tartaglia moved to Verona around 1517, then to Venice in 1534, a major European commercial hub and one of the great centres of the Italian renaissance at this time. Also relevant is Venice&#x27;s place at the forefront of European printing culture in the sixteenth century, making early printed texts available even to poor scholars if sufficiently motivated or well-connected — Tartaglia knew of Archimedes&#x27; work on the quadrature of the parabola, for example, from Guarico&#x27;s Latin edition of 1503, which he had found &quot;in the hands of a sausage-seller in Verona in 1531&quot; (&quot;in mano di un salzizaro in Verona, l&#x27;anno 1531&quot; in his words). Tartaglia&#x27;s mathematics is also influenced by the works of medieval Islamic scholar Muhammad ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi from 12th Century Latin translations becoming available in Europe.

Tartaglia eked out a living teaching practical mathematics in abacus schools and earned a penny where he could:

He died in Venice.

==Ballistics==

&quot;Nova Scientia&quot; (1537) was Tartaglia&#x27;s first published work, described by Matteo Valleriani as:

Then dominant Aristotelian physics preferred categories like &quot;heavy&quot; and &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;violent&quot; to describe motion, generally eschewing mathematical explanations. Tartaglia brought mathematical models to the fore, &quot;eviscerat[ing] Aristotelian terms of projectile movement&quot; in the words of Mary J. Henninger-Voss. One of his findings was that the maximum range of a projectile was achieved by directing the cannon at a 45° angle to the horizon.

Tartaglia&#x27;s model for a cannonball&#x27;s flight was that it proceeded from the cannon in a straight line, then after a while started to arc towards the earth along a circular path, then finally dropped in another straight line directly towards the earth. At the end of Book 2 of &quot;Nova Scientia&quot;, Tartaglia proposes to find the length of that initial rectilinear path for a projectile fired at an elevation of 45°, engaging in a Euclidean-style argument, but one with numbers attached to line segments and areas, and eventually proceeds algebraically to find the desired quantity (&quot;procederemo per algebra&quot; in his words).

Mary J. Henninger-Voss notes that &quot;Tartaglia&#x27;s work on military science had an enormous circulation throughout Europe&quot;, being a reference for common gunners into the eighteenth century, sometimes through unattributed translations. He influenced Galileo as well, who owned &quot;richly annotated&quot; copies of his works on ballistics as he set about solving the projectile problem once and for all.

==Translations==
Archimedes&#x27; works began to be studied outside the universities in Tartaglia&#x27;s day as exemplary of the notion that mathematics is the key to understanding physics, Federigo Commandino reflecting this notion when saying in 1558 that &quot;with respect to geometry no one of sound mind could deny that Archimedes was some god&quot;. Tartaglia published a 71-page Latin edition of Archimedes in 1543, &quot;Opera Archimedis Syracusani philosophi et mathematici ingeniosissimi&quot;, containing Archimedes&#x27; works on the parabola, the circle, centres of gravity, and floating bodies. Guarico had published Latin editions of the first two in 1503, but the works on centres of gravity and floating bodies had not been published before. Tartaglia published Italian versions of some Archimedean texts later in life, his executor continuing to publish his translations after his death. Galileo probably learned of Archimedes&#x27; work through these widely disseminated editions.

Tartaglia&#x27;s Italian edition of Euclid in 1543, &quot;Euclide Megarense philosopho&quot;, was especially significant as the first translation of the &quot;Elements&quot; into any modern European language. For two centuries Euclid had been taught from two Latin translations taken from an Arabic source; these contained errors in Book V, the Eudoxian theory of proportion, which rendered it unusable. Tartaglia&#x27;s edition was based on Zamberti&#x27;s Latin translation of an uncorrupted Greek text, and rendered Book V correctly. He also wrote the first modern and useful commentary on the theory. This work went through many editions in the sixteenth century and helped diffuse knowledge of mathematics to a non-academic but increasingly well-informed literate and numerate public in Italy. The theory became an essential tool for Galileo, as it had been for Archimedes.

==&quot;General Trattato di Numeri et Misure&quot;==

Tartaglia exemplified and eventually transcended the abaco tradition that had flourished in Italy since the twelfth century, a tradition of concrete commercial mathematics taught at abacus schools maintained by communities of merchants. &quot;Maestros d&#x27;abaco&quot; like Tartaglia taught not with the abacus but with paper-and-pen, inculcating algorithms of the type found in grade schools today.

Tartaglia&#x27;s masterpiece was the &quot;General Trattato di Numeri et Misure&quot; (&quot;General Treatise on Number and Measure&quot;), a 1500-page encyclopedia in six parts written in the Venetian dialect, the first three coming out in 1556 about the time of Tartaglia&#x27;s death and the last three published posthumously by his literary executor and publisher Curtio Troiano in 1560. David Eugene Smith wrote of the &quot;General Trattato&quot; that it was:

Part I is 554 pages long and constitutes essentially commercial arithmetic, taking up such topics as basic operations with the complex currencies of the day (ducats, soldi, pizolli, and so on), exchanging currencies, calculating interest, and dividing profits into joint companies. The book is replete with worked examples with much emphasis on methods and rules (that is, algorithms), all ready to use virtually as is.

Part II takes up more general arithmetic problems, including progressions, powers, binomial expansions, Tartaglia&#x27;s triangle (also known as &quot;Pascal&#x27;s triangle&quot;), calculations with roots, and proportions / fractions.

Part IV concerns triangles, regular polygons, the Platonic solids, and Archimedean topics like the quadrature of the circle and circumscribing a cylinder around a sphere.

==Tartaglia&#x27;s triangle==
Tartaglia was proficient with binomial expansions and included many worked examples in Part II of the &quot;General Trattato&quot;, one a detailed explanation of how to calculate the summands of formula_1, including the appropriate binomial coefficients.

Tartaglia knew of Pascal&#x27;s triangle one hundred years before Pascal, as shown in this image from the &quot;General Trattato&quot;. His examples are numeric, but he thinks about it geometrically, the horizontal line formula_2 at the top of the triangle being broken into two segments formula_3 and formula_4, where point formula_5 is the apex of the triangle. Binomial expansions amount to taking formula_6 for exponents formula_7 as you go down the triangle. The symbols along the outside represent powers at this early stage of algebraic notation: formula_8, and so on. He writes explicitly about the additive formation rule, that (for example) the adjacent 15 and 20 in the fifth row add up to 35, which appears beneath them in the sixth row.

==Solution to cubic equations==
Tartaglia is perhaps best known today for his conflicts with Gerolamo Cardano. In 1539, Cardano cajoled Tartaglia into revealing his solution to the cubic equations by promising not to publish them. Tartaglia divulged the secrets of the solutions of three different forms of the cubic equation in verse. Several years later, Cardano happened to see unpublished work by Scipione del Ferro who independently came up with the same solution as Tartaglia. (Tartaglia had previously been challenged by del Ferro&#x27;s student Fiore, which made Tartaglia aware that a solution existed.)

As the unpublished work was dated before Tartaglia&#x27;s, Cardano decided his promise could be broken and included Tartaglia&#x27;s solution in his next publication. Even though Cardano credited his discovery, Tartaglia was extremely upset and a famous public challenge match resulted between himself and Cardano&#x27;s student, Ludovico Ferrari. Widespread stories that Tartaglia devoted the rest of his life to ruining Cardano, however, appear to be completely fabricated. Mathematical historians now credit both Cardano and Tartaglia with the formula to solve cubic equations, referring to it as the &quot;Cardano–Tartaglia formula&quot;.

==Volume of a tetrahedron==

Tartaglia was a prodigious calculator and master of solid geometry. In Part IV of the &quot;General Trattato&quot; he shows by example how to calculate the height of a pyramid on a triangular base, that is, an irregular tetrahedron.

The base of the pyramid is a 13-14-15 triangle &quot;bcd&quot;, and the edges rising to the apex &quot;a&quot; from points &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;d&quot; have respective lengths 20, 18, and 16. The base triangle &quot;bcd&quot; partitions into 5-12-13 and 9-12-15 triangles by dropping the perpendicular from point &quot;d&quot; to side &quot;bc&quot;. He proceeds to erect a triangle in the plane perpendicular to line &quot;bc&quot; through the pyramid&#x27;s apex, point &quot;a&quot;, calculating all three sides of this triangle and noting that its height is the height of the pyramid. At the last step, he applies what amounts to this formula for the height &quot;h&quot; of a triangle in terms of its sides &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;r&quot; (the height from side &quot;p&quot; to its opposite vertex):

:formula_9

a formula deriving from the law of cosines (not that he cites any justification in this section of the &quot;General Trattato&quot;).

Tartaglia drops a digit early in the calculation, taking as , but his method is sound. The final (correct) answer is:

:formula_10

The volume of the pyramid is easily obtained from this, though Tartaglia does not give it:

:formula_11

Simon Stevin invented decimal fractions later in the sixteenth century, so the approximation would have been foreign to Tartaglia, who always used fractions. His approach is in some ways a modern one, suggesting by example an algorithm for calculating the height of irregular tetrahedra, but (as usual) he gives no explicit general formula.

<text>Nāgārjuna (Sanskrit: नागार्जुन, &quot;Nāgārjuna&quot;; ) was an Indian monk and Mahāyāna Buddhist philosopher of the Madhyamaka (Centrism, Middle Way) school. He is widely considered one of the most important Buddhist philosophers. 

Nāgārjuna is widely considered to be the founder of the Madhyamaka school of Buddhist philosophy and a defender of the Mahāyāna movement. His &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot; (&quot;Root Verses on Madhyamaka&quot;, MMK) is the most important text on the Madhyamaka philosophy of emptiness. The MMK inspired a large number of commentaries in Sanskrit, Chinese, Tibetan, Korean and Japanese and continues to be studied today.

== History ==
=== Background ===
India in the first and second centuries CE was politically divided into various states, including the Kushan Empire and the Satavahana Kingdom. At this point in Buddhist history, the Buddhist community was already divided into various Buddhist schools and had spread throughout India.

At this time, there was already a small and nascent Mahāyāna movement. Mahāyāna ideas were held by a minority of Buddhists in India at the time. As Joseph Walser writes, &quot;Mahāyāna before the fifth century was largely invisible and probably existed only as a minority and largely unrecognized movement within the fold of nikāya Buddhism.&quot; By the second century, early Mahāyāna Sūtras such as the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā&quot; were already circulating among certain Mahāyāna circles.

=== Life ===
Very little is reliably known of the life of Nāgārjuna and modern historians do not agree on a specific date (1st to 3rd century CE) or place (multiple places in India suggested) for him. The earliest surviving accounts were written in Chinese and Tibetan centuries after his death and are mostly hagiographical accounts that are historically unverifiable.

Some scholars such as Joseph Walser argue that Nāgārjuna was an advisor to a king of the Sātavāhana dynasty which ruled the Deccan Plateau in the second century. This is supported by most of the traditional hagiographical sources as well. Archaeological evidence at Amarāvatī indicates that if this is true, the king may have been Yajña Śrī Śātakarṇi (c. second half of the 2nd century). On the basis of this association, Nāgārjuna is conventionally placed at around 150–250 CE.

Walser thinks that it is most likely that when Nāgārjuna wrote the &quot;Ratnavali&quot;, he lived in a mixed monastery (with Mahāyānists and non-Mahāyānists) in which Mahāyānists were the minority. The most likely sectarian affiliation of the monastery according to Walser was Purvasailya, Aparasailya, or Caityaka (which were Mahāsāṃghika sub-schools).

He also argues that &quot;it is plausible that he wrote the &quot;Ratnavali&quot; within a thirty-year period at the end of the second century in the Andhra region around Dhanyakataka (modern-day Amaravati).&quot;

=== Traditional hagiography ===
According to Walser, &quot;the earliest extant legends about Nāgārjuna are compiled into Kumārajīva’s biography of Nāgārjuna, which he translated into Chinese in about 405 CE.&quot; According to this biography, Nāgārjuna was born into a Brahmin family and later became a Buddhist. The traditional religious hagiographies place Nāgārjuna in various regions of India (Kumārajīva and Candrakirti place him in Vidarbha region of South India, Xuanzang in south Kosala)

Traditional religious hagiographies credit Nāgārjuna with being associated with the teaching of the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras as well as with having revealed these scriptures to the world after they had remained hidden for some time. The sources differ on where this happened and how Nāgārjuna retrieved the sutras. Some sources say he retrieved the sutras from the land of the nāgas. 

Nāgārjuna himself is often depicted in composite form comprising human and nāga characteristics. Nāgas are snake-like supernatural beings of great magical power that feature in Hindu, Buddhist and Jain mythology. Nāgas are found throughout Indian religious culture, and typically signify intelligent serpents or dragons that are responsible for rain, lakes, and other bodies of water. In Buddhism, a naga can be a symbol of a realised arhat or wise person.

Traditional sources also claim that Nāgārjuna practised ayurvedic alchemy (rasayāna). Kumārajīva&#x27;s biography for example, has Nāgārjuna making an elixir of invisibility, and Bus-ton, Taranatha and Xuanzang all state that he could turn rocks into gold.

Tibetan hagiographies also state that Nāgārjuna studied at Nālanda University. However, according to Walser, this university was not a strong monastic center until about 425. Also, as Walser notes, &quot;Xuanzang and Yijing both spent considerable time at Nālanda and studied Nāgārjuna’s texts there. It is strange that they would have spent so much time there and yet chose not to report any local tales of a man whose works played such an important part in the curriculum.&quot;

Some sources (Bu-ston and the other Tibetan historians) claim that in his later years, Nāgārjuna lived on the mountain of Śrīparvata near the city that would later be called Nāgārjunakoṇḍa (&quot;Hill of Nāgārjuna&quot;). The ruins of Nāgārjunakoṇḍa are located in Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh. The Caitika and Bahuśrutīya nikāyas are known to have had monasteries in Nāgārjunakoṇḍa. The archaeological finds at Nāgārjunakoṇḍa have not resulted in any evidence that the site was associated with Nagarjuna. The name &quot;Nāgārjunakoṇḍa&quot; dates from the medieval period, and the 3rd-4th century inscriptions found at the site make it clear that it was known as &quot;Vijayapuri&quot; in the ancient period.

=== Other Nāgārjunas ===
There are a multitude of texts attributed to &quot;Nāgārjuna&quot;, many of these texts date from much later periods. This has caused much confusion for the traditional Buddhist biographers and doxographers. Modern scholars are divided on how to classify these later texts and how many later writers called &quot;Nāgārjuna&quot; existed (the name remains popular today in Andhra Pradesh).

Some scholars have posited that there was a separate Aryuvedic writer called Nāgārjuna who wrote numerous treatises on Rasayana. Also, there is a later Tantric Buddhist author by the same name who may have been a scholar at Nālandā University and wrote on Buddhist tantra. According to Donald S. Lopez Jr., he originally belonged to a Brahmin family from eastern India and later became Buddhist.

There is also a Jain figure of the same name who was said to have travelled to the Himalayas. Walser thinks that it is possible that stories related to this figure influenced Buddhist legends as well.

==Works==
There exist a number of influential texts attributed to Nāgārjuna; however, as there are many pseudepigrapha attributed to him, lively controversy exists over which are his authentic works.

===&quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot;===
The &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot; is Nāgārjuna&#x27;s best-known work. It is &quot;not only a grand commentary on the Buddha&#x27;s discourse to Kaccayana, the only discourse cited by name, but also a detailed and careful analysis of most of the important discourses included in the Nikayas and the Agamas, especially those of the &quot;Atthakavagga&quot; of the &quot;Sutta-nipata&quot;.

In the &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot;, &quot;[A]ll experienced phenomena are empty (&quot;sunya&quot;). This did not mean that they are not experienced and, therefore, non-existent; only that they are devoid of a permanent and eternal substance (&quot;svabhava&quot;) because, like a dream, they are mere projections of human consciousness. Since these imaginary fictions are experienced, they are not mere names (&quot;prajnapti&quot;).&quot;

===Major attributed works===
According to David Seyfort Ruegg, the &quot;Madhyamakasastrastuti&quot; attributed to Candrakirti (c. 600 – c. 650) refers to eight texts by Nagarjuna:the &quot;(Madhyamaka)karikas&quot;, the &quot;Yuktisastika&quot;, the &quot;Sunyatasaptati&quot;, the &quot;Vigrahavyavartani&quot;, the &quot;Vidala&quot; (i.e. &quot;Vaidalyasutra/Vaidalyaprakarana&quot;), the &quot;Ratnavali&quot;, the &quot;Sutrasamuccaya&quot;, and &quot;Samstutis&quot; (Hymns). This list covers not only much less than the grand total of works ascribed to Nagarjuna in the Chinese and Tibetan collections, but it does not even include all such works that Candrakirti has himself cited in his writings.According to one view, that of Christian Lindtner, the works definitely written by Nāgārjuna are:

*&quot;Mūlamadhyamaka-kārikā&quot; (Fundamental Verses of the Middle Way, MMK), available in three Sanskrit manuscripts and numerous translations.
*&quot;Śūnyatāsaptati&quot; (Seventy Verses on Emptiness), accompanied by a prose commentary ascribed to Nagarjuna himself.
*&quot;Vigrahavyāvartanī&quot; (The End of Disputes).
* (Pulverizing the Categories), a prose work critiquing the categories used by Indian Nyaya philosophy. 
*&quot;Vyavahārasiddhi&quot; (Proof of Convention).
* (Sixty Verses on Reasoning).
* (Four Hymns): &quot;Lokātīta-stava&quot; (Hymn to transcendence), &quot;Niraupamya-stava&quot; (to the Peerless), &quot;Acintya-stava&quot; (to the Inconceivable), and &quot;Paramārtha-stava&quot; (to Ultimate Truth).
*&quot;Ratnāvalī&quot; (Precious Garland), subtitled (&quot;rajaparikatha&quot;), a discourse addressed to an Indian king (possibly a Satavahana monarch). 
* (Verses on the heart of Dependent Arising), along with a short commentary (&quot;Vyākhyāna&quot;).
*&quot;Sūtrasamuccaya&quot;, an anthology of various sutra passages. 
* (Exposition of the awakening mind).
* (Letter to a Good Friend).
* (Requisites of awakening), a work the path of the Bodhisattva and paramitas, it is quoted by Candrakirti in his commentary on Aryadeva&#x27;s four hundred. Now only extant in Chinese translation (Taisho 1660).

Other scholars have challenged and argued against some of the above works being Nagarjuna&#x27;s. David F. Burton notes that Christian Lindtner is &quot;rather liberal&quot; with his list of works and that other scholars have called some of these into question. He notes how Paul Williams argued convincingly that the must be a later text. In his study, Burton relies on the texts that he considers &quot;least controversial&quot;: &quot;Mūlamadhyamaka-kārikā, Vigrahavyāvartanī, Śūnyatāsaptati,&quot; , , and &quot;Ratnāvalī&quot;. 

Similarly, Jan Westerhoff notes how there is uncertainty about the attribution of Nagarjuna&#x27;s works (and about his life in general). He relies on six works: MMK, &quot;Vigrahavyāvartanī, Śūnyatāsaptati,&quot; , and &quot;Ratnāvalī,&quot; all of which &quot;expound a single, coherent philosophical system,&quot; and are attributed to Nagarjuna by a variety of Indian and Tibetan sources. 

The Tibetan historian Buston considers the first six to be the main treatises of Nāgārjuna (this is called the &quot;yukti corpus&quot;, &quot;rigs chogs&quot;), while according to Tāranātha only the first five are the works of Nāgārjuna. TRV Murti considers &quot;Ratnāvalī&quot;, &quot;Pratītyasamutpādahṝdaya&quot; and &quot;Sūtrasamuccaya&quot; to be works of Nāgārjuna as the first two are quoted profusely by Chandrakirti and the third by Shantideva.

=== Other attributed works ===
In addition to works mentioned above, numerous other works are attributed to Nāgārjuna, many of which are dubious attributions and later works. There is an ongoing, lively controversy over which of those works are authentic. Christian Lindtner divides the various attributed works as &quot;1) correctly attributed, 2) wrongly attributed to him, and 3) those which may or may not be genuine.&quot;

Lindtner further divides the third category of dubious or questionable texts into those which are &quot;perhaps authentic&quot; and those who are unlikely to be authentic.

Those which he sees as &quot;perhaps&quot; being authentic include:

* &quot;Mahāyānavimsika&quot;, it is cited as Nagarjuna&#x27;s work in the &quot;Tattvasamgraha&quot; as well as by Atisha&quot;,&quot; Lindtner sees the style and content as compatible with the yukti corpus. Survives in Sanskrit. 
* &quot;Bodhicittotpādavidhi,&quot; a short text that describes the sevenfold write for a bodhisattva,
* &quot;Dvadasakāranayastotra,&quot; a madhyamaka text only extant in Tibetan, 
* &quot;(Madhyamaka-)Bhavasamkrānti,&quot; a verse from this is attributed to Nagarjuna by Bhavaviveka. 
* &quot;Nirālamba-stava,&quot; 
* &quot;Sālistambakārikā,&quot; only exists in Tibetan, it is a versification of the &quot;Śālistamba Sūtra&quot;
* &quot;Stutytitastava,&quot; only exists in Tibetan
* &quot;Danaparikatha,&quot; only exists in Tibetan, a praise of giving (dana)
* &quot;Cittavajrastava,&quot; 
* &quot;Mulasarvāstivadisrāmanerakārikā,&quot; 50 karikas on the Vinaya of the Mulasarvastivadins
* &quot;Dasabhumikavibhāsā,&quot; only exists in Chinese, a commentary on the &quot;Dashabhumikasutra&quot; 
* &quot;Lokapariksā,&quot; 
* &quot;Yogasataka,&quot; a medical text
* &quot;Prajñadanda&quot;
* &quot;Rasavaisesikasutra,&quot; a rasayana (biochemical) text
* &quot;Bhāvanākrama,&quot; contains various verses similar to the &quot;Lankavatara&quot;, it is cited in the &quot;Tattvasamgraha&quot; as by Nagarjuna
* &quot;Rasratnakar&quot; deals with the formation of mercury compounds.
Ruegg notes various works of uncertain authorship which have been attributed to Nagarjuna, including the &quot;Dharmadhatustava&quot; (Hymn to the Dharmadhatu, which shows later influences), &quot;Mahayanavimsika, Salistambakarikas,&quot; the &quot;Bhavasamkranti,&quot; and the &quot;Dasabhumtkavibhāsā.&quot; Furthermore, Ruegg writes that &quot;three collections of stanzas on the virtues of intelligence and moral conduct ascribed to Nagarjuna are extant in Tibetan translation&quot;: &quot;Prajñasatakaprakarana&quot;, &quot;Nitisastra-Jantuposanabindu&quot; and &quot;Niti-sastra-Prajñadanda.&quot;

=== Attributions which are likely to be false ===
Meanwhile, those texts that Lindtner considers as questionable and likely inauthentic are: &quot;Aksarasataka, Akutobhaya (Mulamadhyamakavrtti), Aryabhattaraka-Manjusriparamarthastuti, Kayatrayastotra, Narakoddharastava, Niruttarastava, Vandanastava, Dharmasamgraha, Dharmadhatugarbhavivarana, Ekaslokasastra, Isvarakartrtvanirakrtih (A refutation of God/Isvara), Sattvaradhanastava, Upayahrdaya, Astadasasunyatasastra, Dharmadhatustava, Yogaratnamala.&quot;Meanwhile, Lindtner&#x27;s list of outright wrong attributions is: &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitopadeśa (Dà zhìdù lùn), Abudhabodhakaprakarana&quot;, &quot;Guhyasamajatantratika&quot;, &quot;Dvadasadvaraka&quot;, &quot;Prajñaparamitastotra,&quot; and &quot;Svabhavatrayapravesasiddhi.&quot;Notably, the &quot;Dà zhìdù lùn&quot; (Taisho 1509, &quot;Commentary on the great prajñaparamita&quot;) which has been influential in Chinese Buddhism, has been questioned as a genuine work of Nāgārjuna by various scholars including Lamotte. This work is also only attested in a Chinese translation by Kumārajīva and is unknown in the Tibetan and Indian traditions.

Other works are extant only in Chinese, one of these is the &quot;Shih-erh-men-lun&quot; or &#x27;Twelve-topic treatise&#x27; (*&quot;Dvadasanikaya&quot; or *&quot;Dvadasamukha-sastra&quot;); one of the three basic treatises of the Sanlun school (East Asian Madhyamaka).

Several works considered important in esoteric Buddhism are attributed to Nāgārjuna and his disciples by traditional historians like Tāranātha from 17th century Tibet. These historians try to account for chronological difficulties with various theories, such as seeing later writings as mystical revelations. For a useful summary of this tradition, see Wedemeyer 2007. Lindtner sees the author of some of these tantric works as being a tantric Nagarjuna who lives much later, sometimes called &quot;Nagarjuna II&quot;.

==Philosophy==
===Sunyata===
Nāgārjuna&#x27;s major thematic focus is the concept of śūnyatā (translated into English as &quot;emptiness&quot;) which brings together other key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anātman &quot;not-self&quot; and pratītyasamutpāda &quot;dependent origination&quot;, to refute the metaphysics of some of his contemporaries. For Nāgārjuna, as for the Buddha in the early texts, it is not merely sentient beings that are &quot;selfless&quot; or non-substantial; all phenomena (dhammas) are without any svabhāva, literally &quot;own-being&quot;, &quot;self-nature&quot;, or &quot;inherent existence&quot; and thus without any underlying essence. They are &quot;empty&quot; of being independently existent; thus the heterodox theories of svabhāva circulating at the time were refuted on the basis of the doctrines of early Buddhism. This is so because all things arise always dependently: not by their own power, but by depending on conditions leading to their becoming —coming into existence—, as opposed to being.

Nāgārjuna means by real any entity which has a nature of its own (svabhāva), which is not produced by causes (akrtaka), which is not dependent on anything else (paratra nirapeksha).

Chapter 24 verse 14 of the &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot; provides one of Nāgārjuna&#x27;s most famous quotations on emptiness and co-arising:

As part of his analysis of the emptiness of phenomena in the &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot;, Nāgārjuna critiques svabhāva in several different concepts. He discusses the problems of positing any sort of inherent essence to causation, movement, change and personal identity. Nāgārjuna makes use of the Indian logical tool of the tetralemma to attack any essentialist conceptions. Nāgārjuna&#x27;s logical analysis is based on four basic propositions:

:All things (dharma) exist: affirmation of being, negation of non-being
:All things (dharma) do not exist: affirmation of non-being, negation of being
:All things (dharma) both exist and do not exist: both affirmation and negation
:All things (dharma) neither exist nor do not exist: neither affirmation nor negation 

To say that all things are &#x27;empty&#x27; is to deny any kind of ontological foundation; therefore Nāgārjuna&#x27;s view is often seen as a kind of ontological anti-foundationalism or a metaphysical anti-realism.

Understanding the nature of the emptiness of phenomena is simply a means to an end, which is nirvana. Thus Nāgārjuna&#x27;s philosophical project is ultimately a soteriological one meant to correct our everyday cognitive processes which mistakenly posits svabhāva on the flow of experience.

Some scholars such as Fyodor Shcherbatskoy and T.R.V. Murti held that Nāgārjuna was the inventor of the Shunyata doctrine; however, more recent work by scholars such as Choong Mun-keat, Yin Shun and Dhammajothi Thero has argued that Nāgārjuna was not an innovator by putting forth this theory, but that, in the words of Shi Huifeng, &quot;the connection between emptiness and dependent origination is not an innovation or creation of Nāgārjuna&quot;.

===Two truths===
Nāgārjuna was also instrumental in the development of the two truths doctrine, which claims that there are two levels of truth in Buddhist teaching, the ultimate truth (&quot;paramārtha satya&quot;) and the conventional or superficial truth (&quot;saṃvṛtisatya&quot;). The ultimate truth to Nāgārjuna is the truth that everything is empty of essence, this includes emptiness itself (&#x27;the emptiness of emptiness&#x27;). While some (Murti, 1955) have interpreted this by positing Nāgārjuna as a neo-Kantian and thus making ultimate truth a metaphysical noumenon or an &quot;ineffable ultimate that transcends the capacities of discursive reason&quot;, others such as Mark Siderits and Jay L. Garfield have argued that Nāgārjuna&#x27;s view is that &quot;the ultimate truth is that there is no ultimate truth&quot; (Siderits) and that Nāgārjuna is a &quot;semantic anti-dualist&quot; who posits that there are only conventional truths. Hence according to Garfield:

Suppose that we take a conventional entity, such as a table. We analyze it to demonstrate its emptiness, finding that there is no table apart from its parts [...]. So we conclude that it is empty. But now let us analyze that emptiness [...]. What do we find? Nothing at all but the table&#x27;s lack of inherent existence. [...]. To see the table as empty [...] is to see the table as conventional, as dependent.

In articulating this notion in the &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot;, Nāgārjuna drew on an early source in the &quot;Kaccānagotta Sutta&quot;, which distinguishes definitive meaning (&quot;nītārtha&quot;) from interpretable meaning (&quot;neyārtha&quot;):

The version linked to is the one found in the nikayas, and is slightly different from the one found in the &quot;Samyuktagama&quot;. Both contain the concept of teaching via the middle between the extremes of existence and non-existence. Nagarjuna does not make reference to &quot;everything&quot; when he quotes the agamic text in his &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot;.

=== Causality ===
Jay L. Garfield describes that Nāgārjuna approached causality from the Four Noble Truths and dependent origination. Nāgārjuna distinguished two dependent origination views in a causal process, that which causes effects and that which causes conditions. This is predicated in the two truth doctrine, as conventional truth and ultimate truth held together, in which both are empty in existence. The distinction between effects and conditions is controversial. In Nāgārjuna&#x27;s approach, cause means an event or state that has power to bring an effect. Conditions, refer to proliferating causes that bring a further event, state or process; without a metaphysical commitment to an occult connection between explaining and explanans. He argues nonexistent causes and various existing conditions. The argument draws from unreal causal power. Things conventional exist and are ultimately nonexistent to rest in the Middle Way in both causal existence and nonexistence as casual emptiness within the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā doctrine. Although seeming strange to Westerners, this is seen as an attack on a reified view of causality.

===Relativity===

Nāgārjuna also taught the idea of relativity; in the Ratnāvalī, he gives the example that shortness exists only in relation to the idea of length. The determination of a thing or object is only possible in relation to other things or objects, especially by way of contrast. He held that the relationship between the ideas of &quot;short&quot; and &quot;long&quot; is not due to intrinsic nature (svabhāva). This idea is also found in the Pali Nikāyas and Chinese Āgamas, in which the idea of relativity is expressed similarly: &quot;That which is the element of light ... is seen to exist on account of [in relation to] darkness; that which is the element of good is seen to exist on account of bad; that which is the element of space is seen to exist on account of form.&quot;

== Comparative philosophy ==

=== Hinduism ===
Nāgārjuna was fully acquainted with the classical Hindu philosophies of Samkhya and even the Vaiseshika. Nāgārjuna assumes a knowledge of the definitions of the sixteen categories as given in the Nyaya Sutras, the chief text of the Hindu Nyaya school, and wrote a treatise on the pramanas where he reduced the syllogism of five members into one of three. In the Vigrahavyavartani Karika, Nāgārjuna criticises the Nyaya theory of &quot;pramanas&quot; (means of knowledge).

=== Mahāyāna Buddhism ===
Nāgārjuna was conversant with many of the Śrāvaka philosophies and with the Mahāyāna tradition; however, determining Nāgārjuna&#x27;s affiliation with a specific nikāya is difficult, considering much of this material has been lost. If the most commonly accepted attribution of texts (that of Christian Lindtner) holds, then he was clearly a Māhayānist, but his philosophy holds assiduously to the Śrāvaka &quot;Tripiṭaka&quot;, and while he does make explicit references to Mahāyāna texts, he is always careful to stay within the parameters set out by the Śrāvaka canon.

Nāgārjuna may have arrived at his positions from a desire to achieve a consistent exegesis of the Buddha&#x27;s doctrine as recorded in the āgamas. In the eyes of Nāgārjuna, the Buddha was not merely a forerunner, but the very founder of the Madhyamaka system. David Kalupahana sees Nāgārjuna as a successor to Moggaliputta-Tissa in being a champion of the middle-way and a reviver of the original philosophical ideals of the Buddha.

=== Pyrrhonism and its influence ===

Because of the high degree of similarity between Nāgārjuna&#x27;s philosophy and Pyrrhonism, particularly the surviving works of Sextus Empiricus, According to Thomas McEvilley this is because Nagarjuna was likely influenced by Greek Pyrrhonist texts imported into India. Pyrrho of Elis (c. 360 – c. 270 BCE), the founder of this school of sceptical philosophy, was himself influenced by Indian philosophy. Pyrrho travelled to India with Alexander the Great&#x27;s army and studied with the gymnosophists. According to Christopher I. Beckwith, Pyrrho&#x27;s teachings are based on Buddhism, because the Greek terms &quot;adiaphora&quot;, &quot;astathmēta&quot; and &quot;anepikrita&quot; in the &quot;Aristocles Passage&quot; resemble the Buddhist three marks of existence. According to him, the key innovative tenets of Pyrrho&#x27;s scepticism were only found in Indian philosophy at the time and not in Greece.
However, other scholars, such as Stephen Batchelor and Charles Goodman question Beckwith&#x27;s conclusions about the degree of Buddhist influence on Pyrrho.

<text>A nuclear reactor is a device used to initiate and control a fission nuclear chain reaction. Nuclear reactors are used for commercial electricity, marine propulsion, weapons production and research. Fissile nuclei (primarily uranium-235 or plutonium-239) absorb single neutrons and split, releasing energy and multiple neutrons, which can induce further fission. Reactors stabilize this, regulating neutron absorbers and moderators in the core. Fuel efficiency is exceptionally high; low-enriched uranium is 120,000 times more energy dense than coal. 

Heat from nuclear fission is passed to a working fluid coolant. In commercial reactors, this drives turbines and electrical generator shafts. Some reactors are used for district heating, and isotope production for medical and industrial use.

Following the 1938 discovery of fission, many countries initiated military nuclear research programs. Early subcritical &quot;atomic piles&quot; probed neutronics. In 1942, the first artificial critical nuclear reactor, Chicago Pile-1, was built by the Metallurgical Laboratory. From 1944, for weapons production, the first large-scale reactors were operated at the Hanford Site. The pressurized water reactor design, used in ~70% of commercial reactors, was developed for US Navy submarine propulsion, beginning with S1W in 1953. In 1954, nuclear electricity production began with the Soviet Obninsk plant.

Spent fuel can be reprocessed, reducing nuclear waste and recovering reactor-usable fuel. This also poses a proliferation risk via production of plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons. 

Reactor accidents have been caused by combinations of design and operator failure. The 1979 Three Mile Island accident, at INES Level 5, and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and 2011 Fukushima disaster, both at Level 7, all had major effects on the nuclear industry and anti-nuclear movement.

, there are 417 commercial reactors, 226 research reactors, and over 200 marine propulsion reactors in operation globally. Commercial reactors provide 9% of the global electricity supply, compared to 30% from renewables, together comprising low-carbon electricity. Almost 90% of this comes from pressurized and boiling water reactors. Other designs include gas-cooled, fast-spectrum, breeder, heavy-water, molten-salt, and small modular; each optimizes safety, efficiency, cost, fuel type, enrichment, and burnup.

==Operation==


Just as conventional thermal power stations generate electricity by harnessing the thermal energy released from burning fossil fuels, nuclear reactors convert the energy released by controlled nuclear fission into thermal energy for further conversion to mechanical or electrical forms.

===Fission===
When a large fissile atomic nucleus such as uranium-235, uranium-233, or plutonium-239 absorbs a neutron, it may undergo nuclear fission. The heavy nucleus splits into two or more lighter nuclei, (the fission products), releasing kinetic energy, gamma radiation, and free neutrons. A portion of these neutrons may be absorbed by other fissile atoms and trigger further fission events, which release more neutrons, and so on. This is known as a nuclear chain reaction.

To control such a nuclear chain reaction, control rods containing neutron poisons and neutron moderators are able to change the portion of neutrons that will go on to cause more fission. Nuclear reactors generally have automatic and manual systems to shut the fission reaction down if monitoring or instrumentation detects unsafe conditions.

===Heat generation===
The reactor core generates heat in a number of ways:
* The kinetic energy of fission products is converted to thermal energy when these nuclei collide with nearby atoms.
* The reactor absorbs some of the gamma rays produced during fission and converts their energy into heat.
* Heat is produced by the radioactive decay of fission products and materials that have been activated by neutron absorption. This decay heat source will remain for some time even after the reactor is shut down.

A kilogram of uranium-235 (U-235) converted via nuclear processes releases approximately three million times more energy than a kilogram of coal burned conventionally (7.2 × 1013 joules per kilogram of uranium-235 versus 2.4 × 107 joules per kilogram of coal).

The fission of one kilogram of uranium-235 releases about 19 billion kilocalories, so the energy released by 1 kg of uranium-235 corresponds to that released by burning 2.7 million kg of coal.

===Cooling===
A nuclear reactor coolant – usually water but sometimes a gas or a liquid metal (like liquid sodium or lead) or molten salt – is circulated past the reactor core to absorb the heat that it generates. The heat is carried away from the reactor and is then used to generate steam. Most reactor systems employ a cooling system that is physically separated from the water that will be boiled to produce pressurized steam for the turbines, like the pressurized water reactor. However, in some reactors the water for the steam turbines is boiled directly by the reactor core; for example the boiling water reactor.

===Reactivity control===

The rate of fission reactions within a reactor core can be adjusted by controlling the quantity of neutrons that are able to induce further fission events. Nuclear reactors typically employ several methods of neutron control to adjust the reactor&#x27;s power output. Some of these methods arise naturally from the physics of radioactive decay and are simply accounted for during the reactor&#x27;s operation, while others are mechanisms engineered into the reactor design for a distinct purpose.

The fastest method for adjusting levels of fission-inducing neutrons in a reactor is via movement of the control rods. Control rods are made of so-called neutron poisons and therefore absorb neutrons. When a control rod is inserted deeper into the reactor, it absorbs more neutrons than the material it displaces – often the moderator. This action results in fewer neutrons available to cause fission and reduces the reactor&#x27;s power output. Conversely, extracting the control rod will result in an increase in the rate of fission events and an increase in power.

The physics of radioactive decay also affects neutron populations in a reactor. One such process is delayed neutron emission by a number of neutron-rich fission isotopes. These delayed neutrons account for about 0.65% of the total neutrons produced in fission, with the remainder (termed &quot;prompt neutrons&quot;) released immediately upon fission. The fission products which produce delayed neutrons have half-lives for their decay by neutron emission that range from milliseconds to as long as several minutes, and so considerable time is required to determine exactly when a reactor reaches the critical point. Keeping the reactor in the zone of chain reactivity where delayed neutrons are &quot;necessary&quot; to achieve a critical mass state allows mechanical devices or human operators to control a chain reaction in &quot;real time&quot;; otherwise the time between achievement of criticality and nuclear meltdown as a result of an exponential power surge from the normal nuclear chain reaction, would be too short to allow for intervention. This last stage, where delayed neutrons are no longer required to maintain criticality, is known as the prompt critical point. There is a scale for describing criticality in numerical form, in which bare criticality is known as &quot;zero dollars&quot; and the prompt critical point is &quot;one dollar&quot;, and other points in the process interpolated in cents.

In some reactors, the coolant also acts as a neutron moderator. A moderator increases the power of the reactor by causing the fast neutrons that are released from fission to lose energy and become thermal neutrons. Thermal neutrons are more likely than fast neutrons to cause fission. If the coolant is a moderator, then temperature changes can affect the density of the coolant/moderator and therefore change power output. A higher temperature coolant would be less dense, and therefore a less effective moderator.

In other reactors, the coolant acts as a poison by absorbing neutrons in the same way that the control rods do. In these reactors, power output can be increased by heating the coolant, which makes it a less dense poison. Nuclear reactors generally have automatic and manual systems to scram the reactor in an emergency shut down. These systems insert large amounts of poison (often boron in the form of boric acid) into the reactor to shut the fission reaction down if unsafe conditions are detected or anticipated.

Most types of reactors are sensitive to a process variously known as xenon poisoning, or the iodine pit. The common fission product Xenon-135 produced in the fission process acts as a neutron poison that absorbs neutrons and therefore tends to shut the reactor down. Xenon-135 accumulation can be controlled by keeping power levels high enough to destroy it by neutron absorption as fast as it is produced. Fission also produces iodine-135, which in turn decays (with a half-life of 6.57 hours) to new xenon-135. When the reactor is shut down, iodine-135 continues to decay to xenon-135, making restarting the reactor more difficult for a day or two, as the xenon-135 decays into cesium-135, which is not nearly as poisonous as xenon-135, with a half-life of 9.2 hours. This temporary state is the &quot;iodine pit.&quot; If the reactor has sufficient extra reactivity capacity, it can be restarted. As the extra xenon-135 is transmuted to xenon-136, which is much less a neutron poison, within a few hours the reactor experiences a &quot;xenon burnoff (power) transient&quot;. Control rods must be further inserted to replace the neutron absorption of the lost xenon-135. Failure to properly follow such a procedure was a key step in the Chernobyl disaster.

Reactors used in nuclear marine propulsion (especially nuclear submarines) often cannot be run at continuous power around the clock in the same way that land-based power reactors are normally run, and in addition often need to have a very long core life without refueling. For this reason many designs use highly enriched uranium but incorporate burnable neutron poison in the fuel rods. This allows the reactor to be constructed with an excess of fissionable material, which is nevertheless made relatively safe early in the reactor&#x27;s fuel burn cycle by the presence of the neutron-absorbing material which is later replaced by normally produced long-lived neutron poisons (far longer-lived than xenon-135) which gradually accumulate over the fuel load&#x27;s operating life.

===Electrical power generation===
The energy released in the fission process generates heat, some of which can be converted into usable energy. A common method of harnessing this thermal energy is to use it to boil water to produce pressurized steam which will then drive a steam turbine that turns an alternator and generates electricity.

=== Life-times ===
Modern nuclear power plants are typically designed for a lifetime of 60 years, while older reactors were built with a planned typical lifetime of 30–40 years, though many of those have received renovations and life extensions of 15–20 years. Some believe nuclear power plants can operate for as long as 80 years or longer with proper maintenance and management. While most components of a nuclear power plant, such as steam generators, are replaced when they reach the end of their useful lifetime, the overall lifetime of the power plant is limited by the life of components that cannot be replaced when aged by wear and neutron embrittlement, such as the reactor pressure vessel. At the end of their planned life span, plants may get an extension of the operating license for some 20 years and in the US even a &quot;subsequent license renewal&quot; (SLR) for an additional 20 years.

Even when a license is extended, it does not guarantee the reactor will continue to operate, particularly in the face of safety concerns or incident. Many reactors are closed long before their license or design life expired and are decommissioned. The costs for replacements or improvements required for continued safe operation may be so high that they are not cost-effective. Or they may be shut down due to technical failure. Other ones have been shut down because the area was contaminated, like Fukushima, Three Mile Island, Sellafield, and Chernobyl. The British branch of the French concern EDF Energy, for example, extended the operating lives of its Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors (AGR) with only between 3 and 10 years. All seven AGR plants were expected to be shut down in 2022 and in decommissioning by 2028. Hinkley Point B was extended from 40 to 46 years, and closed. The same happened with Hunterston B, also after 46 years.

An increasing number of reactors is reaching or crossing their design lifetimes of 30 or 40 years. In 2014, Greenpeace warned that the lifetime extension of ageing nuclear power plants amounts to entering a new era of risk. It estimated the current European nuclear liability coverage in average to be too low by a factor of between 100 and 1,000 to cover the likely costs, while at the same time, the likelihood of a serious accident happening in Europe continues to increase as the reactor fleet grows older.

==Early reactors==

The neutron was discovered in 1932 by British physicist James Chadwick. The concept of a nuclear chain reaction brought about by nuclear reactions mediated by neutrons was first realized shortly thereafter, by Hungarian scientist Leó Szilárd, in 1933. He filed a patent for his idea of a simple reactor the following year while working at the Admiralty in London, England. However, Szilárd&#x27;s idea did not incorporate the idea of nuclear fission as a neutron source, since that process was not yet discovered. Szilárd&#x27;s ideas for nuclear reactors using neutron-mediated nuclear chain reactions in light elements proved unworkable.

Inspiration for a new type of reactor using uranium came from the discovery by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and Fritz Strassmann in 1938 that bombardment of uranium with neutrons (provided by an alpha-on-beryllium fusion reaction, a &quot;neutron howitzer&quot;) produced a barium residue, which they reasoned was created by fission of the uranium nuclei. In their second publication on nuclear fission in February 1939, Hahn and Strassmann predicted the existence and liberation of additional neutrons during the fission process, opening the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction. Subsequent studies in early 1939 (one of them by Szilárd and Fermi), revealed that several neutrons were indeed released during fission, making available the opportunity for the nuclear chain reaction that Szilárd had envisioned six years previously.

On 2 August 1939, Albert Einstein signed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt (written by Szilárd) suggesting that the discovery of uranium&#x27;s fission could lead to the development of &quot;extremely powerful bombs of a new type&quot;, giving impetus to the study of reactors and fission. Szilárd and Einstein knew each other well and had worked together years previously, but Einstein had never thought about this possibility for nuclear energy until Szilard reported it to him, at the beginning of his quest to produce the Einstein-Szilárd letter to alert the U.S. government.

Shortly after, Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939, starting World War II in Europe. The U.S. was not yet officially at war, but in October, when the Einstein-Szilárd letter was delivered to him, Roosevelt commented that the purpose of doing the research was to make sure &quot;the Nazis don&#x27;t blow us up.&quot; The U.S. nuclear project followed, although with some delay as there remained skepticism (some of it from Enrico Fermi) and also little action from the small number of officials in the government who were initially charged with moving the project forward.

The following year, the U.S. Government received the Frisch–Peierls memorandum from the UK, which stated that the amount of uranium needed for a chain reaction was far lower than had previously been thought. The memorandum was a product of the MAUD Committee, which was working on the UK atomic bomb project, known as Tube Alloys, later to be subsumed within the Manhattan Project.

Eventually, the first artificial nuclear reactor, Chicago Pile-1, was constructed at the University of Chicago, by a team led by Italian physicist Enrico Fermi, in late 1942. By this time, the program had been pressured for a year by U.S. entry into the war. The Chicago Pile achieved criticality on 2 December 1942 at 3:25 PM. The reactor support structure was made of wood, which supported a pile (hence the name) of graphite blocks, embedded in which was natural uranium oxide &#x27;pseudospheres&#x27; or &#x27;briquettes&#x27;.

Soon after the Chicago Pile, the Metallurgical Laboratory developed a number of nuclear reactors for the Manhattan Project starting in 1943. The primary purpose for the largest reactors (located at the Hanford Site in Washington), was the mass production of plutonium for nuclear weapons. Fermi and Szilard applied for a patent on reactors on 19 December 1944. Its issuance was delayed for 10 years because of wartime secrecy.

&quot;World&#x27;s first nuclear power plant&quot; is the claim made by signs at the site of the EBR-I, which is now a museum near Arco, Idaho. Originally called &quot;Chicago Pile-4&quot;, it was carried out under the direction of Walter Zinn for Argonne National Laboratory. This experimental LMFBR operated by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission produced 0.8 kW in a test on 20 December 1951 and 100 kW (electrical) the following day, having a design output of 200 kW (electrical).

Besides the military uses of nuclear reactors, there were political reasons to pursue civilian use of atomic energy. U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower made his famous Atoms for Peace speech to the UN General Assembly on 8 December 1953. This diplomacy led to the dissemination of reactor technology to U.S. institutions and worldwide.

The first nuclear power plant built for civil purposes was the AM-1 Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant, launched on 27 June 1954 in the Soviet Union. It produced around 5 MW (electrical). It was built after the F-1 (nuclear reactor) which was the first reactor to go critical in Europe, and was also built by the Soviet Union.

After World War II, the U.S. military sought other uses for nuclear reactor technology. Research by the Army led to the power stations for Camp Century, Greenland and McMurdo Station, Antarctica Army Nuclear Power Program. The Air Force Nuclear Bomber project resulted in the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment. The U.S. Navy succeeded when they steamed the USS &quot;Nautilus&quot; (SSN-571) on nuclear power 17 January 1955.

The first commercial nuclear power station, Calder Hall in Sellafield, England was opened in 1956 with an initial capacity of 50 MW (later 200 MW).

The first portable nuclear reactor &quot;Alco PM-2A&quot; was used to generate electrical power (2 MW) for Camp Century from 1960 to 1963.

====By type of nuclear reaction====
All commercial power reactors are based on nuclear fission. They generally use uranium and its product plutonium as nuclear fuel, though a thorium fuel cycle is also possible. Fission reactors can be divided roughly into two classes, depending on the energy of the neutrons that sustain the fission chain reaction:
* Thermal-neutron reactors use slowed or thermal neutrons to keep up the fission of their fuel. Almost all current reactors are of this type. These contain neutron moderator materials that slow neutrons until their neutron temperature is &quot;thermalized&quot;, that is, until their kinetic energy approaches the average kinetic energy of the surrounding particles. Thermal neutrons have a far higher cross section (probability) of fissioning the fissile nuclei uranium-235, plutonium-239, and plutonium-241, and a relatively lower probability of neutron capture by uranium-238 (U-238) compared to the faster neutrons that originally result from fission, allowing use of low-enriched uranium or even natural uranium fuel. The moderator is often also the coolant, usually water under high pressure to increase the boiling point. These are surrounded by a reactor vessel, instrumentation to monitor and control the reactor, radiation shielding, and a containment building.
* Fast-neutron reactors use fast neutrons to cause fission in their fuel. They do not have a neutron moderator, and use less-moderating coolants. Maintaining a chain reaction requires the fuel to be more highly enriched in fissile material (about 20% or more) due to the relatively lower probability of fission versus capture by U-238. Fast reactors have the potential to produce less transuranic waste because all actinides are fissionable with fast neutrons, but they are more difficult to build and more expensive to operate. Overall, fast reactors are less common than thermal reactors in most applications. Some early power stations were fast reactors, as are some Russian naval propulsion units. Construction of prototypes is continuing (see fast breeder or generation IV reactors).

In principle, fusion power could be produced by nuclear fusion of elements such as the deuterium isotope of hydrogen. While an ongoing rich research topic since at least the 1940s, no self-sustaining fusion reactor for any purpose has ever been built.

====By moderator material====
Used by thermal reactors:
* Graphite-moderated reactors
** Mostly early reactors such as the Chicago pile, Obninsk am 1, Windscale piles, RBMK, Magnox, and others such as AGR use graphite as a moderator.
* Water moderated reactors
**Heavy-water reactors (Used in Canada, India, Argentina, China, Pakistan, Romania and South Korea).
** Light-water-moderated reactors (LWRs). Light-water reactors (the most common type of thermal reactor) use ordinary water to moderate and cool the reactors. Because the light hydrogen isotope is a slight neutron poison, these reactors need artificially enriched fuels. When at operating temperature, if the temperature of the water increases, its density drops, and fewer neutrons passing through it are slowed enough to trigger further reactions. That negative feedback stabilizes the reaction rate. Graphite and heavy-water reactors tend to be more thoroughly thermalized than light water reactors. Due to the extra thermalization, and the absence of the light hydrogen poisoning effects these types can use natural uranium/unenriched fuel.
* Light-element-moderated reactors.
** Molten-salt reactors (MSRs) are moderated by light elements such as lithium or beryllium, which are constituents of the coolant/fuel matrix salts &quot;LiF&quot; and &quot;BeF2&quot;, &quot;LiCl&quot; and &quot;BeCl2&quot; and other light element containing salts can all cause a moderating effect.
** Liquid metal cooled reactors, such as those whose coolant is a mixture of lead and bismuth, may use BeO as a moderator.
* Organically moderated reactors (OMR) use biphenyl and terphenyl as moderator and coolant.

====By coolant====
* Water cooled reactor. These constitute the great majority of operational nuclear reactors: as of 2014, 93% of the world&#x27;s nuclear reactors are water cooled, providing about 95% of the world&#x27;s total nuclear generation capacity.
** Pressurized water reactor (PWR) Pressurized water reactors constitute the large majority of all Western nuclear power plants.
*** A primary characteristic of PWRs is a pressurizer, a specialized pressure vessel. Most commercial PWRs and naval reactors use pressurizers. During normal operation, a pressurizer is partially filled with water, and a steam bubble is maintained above it by heating the water with submerged heaters. During normal operation, the pressurizer is connected to the primary reactor pressure vessel (RPV) and the pressurizer &quot;bubble&quot; provides an expansion space for changes in water volume in the reactor. This arrangement also provides a means of pressure control for the reactor by increasing or decreasing the steam pressure in the pressurizer using the pressurizer heaters.
*** Pressurized heavy water reactors are a subset of pressurized water reactors, sharing the use of a pressurized, isolated heat transport loop, but using heavy water as coolant and moderator for the greater neutron economies it offers.
** Boiling water reactor (BWR)
*** BWRs are characterized by boiling water around the fuel rods in the lower portion of a primary reactor pressure vessel. A boiling water reactor uses 235U, enriched as uranium dioxide, as its fuel. The fuel is assembled into rods housed in a steel vessel that is submerged in water. The nuclear fission causes the water to boil, generating steam. This steam flows through pipes into turbines. The turbines are driven by the steam, and this process generates electricity. During normal operation, pressure is controlled by the amount of steam flowing from the reactor pressure vessel to the turbine.
** Supercritical water reactor (SCWR)
*** SCWRs are a Generation IV reactor concept where the reactor is operated at supercritical pressures and water is heated to a supercritical fluid, which never undergoes a transition to steam yet behaves like saturated steam, to power a steam generator.
** Reduced moderation water reactor [RMWR] which use more highly enriched fuel with the fuel elements set closer together to allow a faster neutron spectrum sometimes called an Epithermal neutron Spectrum.
** Pool-type reactor can refer to unpressurized water cooled open pool reactors, but not to be confused with pool type LMFBRs which are sodium cooled
** Some reactors have been cooled by heavy water which also served as a moderator. Examples include:
***Early CANDU reactors (later ones use heavy water moderator but light water coolant)
***DIDO class research reactors 
* Liquid metal cooled reactor. Since water is a moderator, it cannot be used as a coolant in a fast reactor. Liquid metal coolants have included sodium, NaK, lead, lead-bismuth eutectic, and in early reactors, mercury.
** Sodium-cooled fast reactor
** Lead-cooled fast reactor
* Gas cooled reactors are cooled by a circulating gas. In commercial nuclear power plants carbon dioxide has usually been used, for example in current British AGR nuclear power plants and formerly in a number of first generation British, French, Italian, and Japanese plants. Nitrogen and helium have also been used, helium being considered particularly suitable for high temperature designs. Use of the heat varies, depending on the reactor. Commercial nuclear power plants run the gas through a heat exchanger to make steam for a steam turbine. Some experimental designs run hot enough that the gas can directly power a gas turbine.
* Molten-salt reactors (MSRs) are cooled by circulating a molten salt, typically a eutectic mixture of fluoride salts, such as FLiBe. In a typical MSR, the coolant is also used as a matrix in which the fissile material is dissolved. Other eutectic salt combinations used include &quot;ZrF4&quot; with &quot;NaF&quot; and &quot;LiCl&quot; with &quot;BeCl2&quot;.
* Organic nuclear reactors use organic fluids such as biphenyl and terphenyl as coolant rather than water.

====By generation====
* Generation I reactor (early prototypes such as Shippingport Atomic Power Station, research reactors, non-commercial power producing reactors)
* Generation II reactor (most current nuclear power plants, 1965–1996)
* Generation III reactor (evolutionary improvements of existing designs, 1996–2016)
* Generation III+ reactor (evolutionary development of Gen III reactors, offering improvements in safety over Gen III reactor designs, 2017–2021)
* Generation IV reactor (technologies still under development; unknown start date, see below)
* Generation V reactor (designs which are theoretically possible, but which are not being actively considered or researched at present).
In 2003, the French Commissariat à l&#x27;Énergie Atomique (CEA) was the first to refer to &quot;Gen II&quot; types in &quot;Nucleonics Week&quot;.

The first mention of &quot;Gen III&quot; was in 2000, in conjunction with the launch of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) plans.

&quot;Gen IV&quot; was named in 2000, by the United States Department of Energy (DOE), for developing new plant types.

====By phase of fuel====
* Solid fueled
* Fluid fueled
** Aqueous homogeneous reactor
** Molten-salt reactor
* Gas fueled (theoretical)

====By shape of the core====
* Cubical
* Cylindrical
* Octagonal
* Spherical
* Slab
* Annulus

====By use====
* Electricity
** Nuclear power plants including small modular reactors
* Propulsion, see nuclear propulsion
** Nuclear marine propulsion
** Various proposed forms of rocket propulsion
* Other uses of heat
** Desalination
** Heat for domestic and industrial heating
** Hydrogen production for use in a hydrogen economy
* Production reactors for transmutation of elements
** Breeder reactors are capable of producing more fissile material than they consume during the fission chain reaction (by converting fertile U-238 to Pu-239, or Th-232 to U-233). Thus, a uranium breeder reactor, once running, can be refueled with natural or even depleted uranium, and a thorium breeder reactor can be refueled with thorium; however, an initial stock of fissile material is required.
** Creating various radioactive isotopes, such as americium for use in smoke detectors, and cobalt-60, molybdenum-99 and others, used for imaging and medical treatment.
** Production of materials for nuclear weapons such as weapons-grade plutonium
* Providing a source of neutron radiation (for example with the pulsed Godiva device) and positron radiation (e.g. neutron activation analysis and potassium-argon dating)
* Research reactor: Typically reactors used for research and training, materials testing, or the production of radioisotopes for medicine and industry. These are much smaller than power reactors or those propelling ships, and many are on university campuses. There are about 280 such reactors operating, in 56 countries. Some operate with high-enriched uranium fuel, and international efforts are underway to substitute low-enriched fuel.

===Current technologies===
* Pressurized water reactors (PWR) [moderator: high-pressure water; coolant: high-pressure water]

:: These reactors use a pressure vessel to contain the nuclear fuel, control rods, moderator, and coolant. The hot radioactive water that leaves the pressure vessel is looped through a steam generator, which in turn heats a secondary (nonradioactive) loop of water to steam that can run turbines. They represent the majority (around 80%) of current reactors. This is a thermal neutron reactor design, the newest of which are the Russian VVER-1200, Japanese Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor, American AP1000, Chinese Hualong Pressurized Reactor and the Franco-German European Pressurized Reactor. All the United States Naval reactors are of this type.
* Boiling water reactors (BWR) [moderator: low-pressure water; coolant: low-pressure water]

:: A BWR is like a PWR without the steam generator. The lower pressure of its cooling water allows it to boil inside the pressure vessel, producing the steam that runs the turbines. Unlike a PWR, there is no primary and secondary loop. The thermal efficiency of these reactors can be higher, and they can be simpler, and even potentially more stable and safe. This is a thermal-neutron reactor design, the newest of which are the Advanced Boiling Water Reactor and the Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor.

* Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) [moderator: high-pressure heavy water; coolant: high-pressure heavy water]

:: A Canadian design (known as CANDU), very similar to PWRs but using heavy water. While heavy water is significantly more expensive than ordinary water, it has greater neutron economy (creates a higher number of thermal neutrons), allowing the reactor to operate without fuel enrichment facilities. Instead of using a single large pressure vessel as in a PWR, the fuel is contained in hundreds of pressure tubes. These reactors are fueled with natural uranium and are thermal-neutron reactor designs. PHWRs can be refueled while at full power, (online refueling) which makes them very efficient in their use of uranium (it allows for precise flux control in the core). CANDU PHWRs have been built in Canada, Argentina, China, India, Pakistan, Romania, and South Korea. India also operates a number of PHWRs, often termed &#x27;CANDU derivatives&#x27;, built after the Government of Canada halted nuclear dealings with India following the 1974 Smiling Buddha nuclear weapon test.
* Reaktor Bolshoy Moschnosti Kanalniy (High Power Channel Reactor) (RBMK) (also known as a Light-Water Graphite-moderated Reactor—LWGR) [moderator: graphite; coolant: high-pressure water]

:: A Soviet design, RBMKs are in some respects similar to CANDU in that they can be refueled during power operation and employ a pressure tube design instead of a PWR-style pressure vessel. However, unlike CANDU they are unstable and large, making containment buildings for them expensive. A series of critical safety flaws have also been identified with the RBMK design, though some of these were corrected following the Chernobyl disaster. Their main attraction is their use of light water and unenriched uranium. As of 2024, 7 remain open, mostly due to safety improvements and help from international safety agencies such as the U.S. Department of Energy. Despite these safety improvements, RBMK reactors are still considered one of the most dangerous reactor designs in use. RBMK reactors were deployed only in the former Soviet Union.
* Gas-cooled reactor (GCR) and advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR) [moderator: graphite; coolant: carbon dioxide]

:: These designs have a high thermal efficiency compared with PWRs due to higher operating temperatures. There are a number of operating reactors of this design, mostly in the United Kingdom, where the concept was developed. Older designs (i.e. Magnox stations) are either shut down or will be in the near future. However, the AGRs have an anticipated life of a further 10 to 20 years. This is a thermal-neutron reactor design. Decommissioning costs can be high due to the large volume of the reactor core.
* Liquid metal fast-breeder reactor (LMFBR) [moderator: none; coolant: liquid metal]
:: This totally unmoderated reactor design produces more fuel than it consumes. They are said to &quot;breed&quot; fuel, because they produce fissionable fuel during operation because of neutron capture. These reactors can function much like a PWR in terms of efficiency, and do not require much high-pressure containment, as the liquid metal does not need to be kept at high pressure, even at very high temperatures. These reactors are fast neutron, not thermal neutron designs. These reactors come in two types:

:::Lead-cooled
:::: Using lead as the liquid metal provides excellent radiation shielding, and allows for operation at very high temperatures. Also, lead is (mostly) transparent to neutrons, so fewer neutrons are lost in the coolant, and the coolant does not become radioactive. Unlike sodium, lead is mostly inert, so there is less risk of explosion or accident, but such large quantities of lead may be problematic from toxicology and disposal points of view. Often a reactor of this type would use a lead-bismuth eutectic mixture. In this case, the bismuth would present some minor radiation problems, as it is not quite as transparent to neutrons, and can be transmuted to a radioactive isotope more readily than lead. The Russian Alfa class submarine uses a lead-bismuth-cooled fast reactor as its main power plant.
::: Sodium-cooled
:::: Most LMFBRs are of this type. The TOPAZ, BN-350 and BN-600 in USSR; Superphénix in France; and Fermi-I in the United States were reactors of this type. The sodium is relatively easy to obtain and work with, and it also manages to actually prevent corrosion on the various reactor parts immersed in it. However, sodium explodes violently when exposed to water, so care must be taken, but such explosions would not be more violent than (for example) a leak of superheated fluid from a pressurized-water reactor. The Monju reactor in Japan suffered a sodium leak in 1995 and could not be restarted until May 2010. The EBR-I, the first reactor to have a core meltdown, in 1955, was also a sodium-cooled reactor. 
* Pebble-bed reactors (PBR) [moderator: graphite; coolant: helium]
:: These use fuel molded into ceramic balls, and then circulate gas through the balls. The result is an efficient, low-maintenance, very safe reactor with inexpensive, standardized fuel. The prototypes were the AVR and the THTR-300 in Germany, which produced up to 308MW of electricity between 1985 and 1989 until it was shut down after experiencing a series of incidents and technical difficulties. The HTR-10 is operating in China, where the HTR-PM is being developed. The HTR-PM is expected to be the first generation IV reactor to enter operation.
* Molten-salt reactors (MSR) [moderator: graphite, or none for fast spectrum MSRs; coolant: molten salt mixture]
::These dissolve the fuels in fluoride or chloride salts, or use such salts for coolant. MSRs potentially have many safety features, including the absence of high pressures or highly flammable components in the core. They were initially designed for aircraft propulsion due to their high efficiency and high power density. One prototype, the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment, was built to confirm the feasibility of the Liquid fluoride thorium reactor, a thermal spectrum reactor which would breed fissile uranium-233 fuel from thorium.
* Aqueous homogeneous reactor (AHR) [moderator: high-pressure light or heavy water; coolant: high-pressure light or heavy water]

:: These reactors use as fuel soluble nuclear salts (usually uranium sulfate or uranium nitrate) dissolved in water and mixed with the coolant and the moderator. As of April 2006, only five AHRs were in operation.

===Future and developing technologies===

====Advanced reactors====
More than a dozen advanced reactor designs are in various stages of development. Some are evolutionary from the PWR, BWR and PHWR designs above, and some are more radical departures. The former include the advanced boiling water reactor (ABWR), two of which are now operating with others under construction, and the planned passively safe Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) and AP1000 units (see Nuclear Power 2010 Program).
* The integral fast reactor (IFR) was built, tested and evaluated during the 1980s and then retired under the Clinton administration in the 1990s due to nuclear non-proliferation policies of the administration. Recycling spent fuel is the core of its design and it therefore produces only a fraction of the waste of current reactors.
* The pebble-bed reactor, a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGCR), is designed so high temperatures reduce power output by Doppler broadening of the fuel&#x27;s neutron cross-section. It uses ceramic fuels so its safe operating temperatures exceed the power-reduction temperature range. Most designs are cooled by inert helium. Helium is not subject to steam explosions, resists neutron absorption leading to radioactivity, and does not dissolve contaminants that can become radioactive. Typical designs have more layers (up to 7) of passive containment than light water reactors (usually 3). A unique feature that may aid safety is that the fuel balls actually form the core&#x27;s mechanism, and are replaced one by one as they age. The design of the fuel makes fuel reprocessing expensive.
* The small, sealed, transportable, autonomous reactor (SSTAR) is being primarily researched and developed in the US, intended as a fast breeder reactor that is passively safe and could be remotely shut down in case the suspicion arises that it is being tampered with.
* The Clean and Environmentally Safe Advanced Reactor (CAESAR) is a nuclear reactor concept that uses steam as a moderator – this design is in development.
* The reduced moderation water reactor builds upon the Advanced boiling water reactor ABWR) that is presently in use. It is not a complete fast reactor instead using mostly epithermal neutrons, which are between thermal and fast neutrons in speed.
* The hydrogen-moderated self-regulating nuclear power module (HPM) is a reactor design emanating from the Los Alamos National Laboratory that uses uranium hydride as fuel.
* Subcritical reactors are designed to be safer and more stable, but pose a number of engineering and economic difficulties. One example is the energy amplifier.
* Thorium-based reactors – It is possible to convert Thorium-232 into U-233 in reactors specially designed for the purpose. In this way, thorium, which is four times more abundant than uranium, can be used to breed U-233 nuclear fuel. U-233 is also believed to have favourable nuclear properties as compared to traditionally used U-235, including better neutron economy and lower production of long lived transuranic waste.
** Advanced heavy-water reactor (AHWR) – A proposed heavy water moderated nuclear power reactor that will be the next generation design of the PHWR type. Under development in the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), India.
** KAMINI – A unique reactor using Uranium-233 isotope for fuel. Built in India by BARC and Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Research (IGCAR).
** India is also planning to build fast breeder reactors using the thorium – Uranium-233 fuel cycle. The FBTR (Fast Breeder Test Reactor) in operation at Kalpakkam (India) uses Plutonium as a fuel and liquid sodium as a coolant.
** China, which has control of the Cerro Impacto deposit, has a reactor and hopes to replace coal energy with nuclear energy.

Rolls-Royce aims to sell nuclear reactors for the production of synfuel for aircraft.

====Generation IV reactors====
Generation IV reactors are a set of theoretical nuclear reactor designs. These are generally not expected to be available for commercial use before 2040–2050, although the World Nuclear Association suggested that some might enter commercial operation before 2030. Current reactors in operation around the world are generally considered second- or third-generation systems, with the first-generation systems having been retired some time ago. Research into these reactor types was officially started by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) based on eight technology goals. The primary goals being to improve nuclear safety, improve proliferation resistance, minimize waste and natural resource utilization, and to decrease the cost to build and run such plants.
* Gas-cooled fast reactor
* Lead-cooled fast reactor
* Molten-salt reactor
* Sodium-cooled fast reactor
* Supercritical water reactor
* Very-high-temperature reactor

====Generation V+ reactors====
Generation V reactors are designs which are theoretically possible, but which are not being actively considered or researched at present. Though some generation V reactors could potentially be built with current or near term technology, they trigger little interest for reasons of economics, practicality, or safety.
* Liquid-core reactor. A closed loop liquid-core nuclear reactor, where the fissile material is molten uranium or uranium solution cooled by a working gas pumped in through holes in the base of the containment vessel.
* Gas-core reactor. A closed loop version of the nuclear lightbulb rocket, where the fissile material is gaseous uranium hexafluoride contained in a fused silica vessel. A working gas (such as hydrogen) would flow around this vessel and absorb the UV light produced by the reaction. This reactor design could also function as a rocket engine, as featured in Harry Harrison&#x27;s 1976 science-fiction novel &quot;Skyfall&quot;. In theory, using UF6 as a working fuel directly (rather than as a stage to one, as is done now) would mean lower processing costs, and very small reactors. In practice, running a reactor at such high power densities would probably produce unmanageable neutron flux, weakening most reactor materials, and therefore as the flux would be similar to that expected in fusion reactors, it would require similar materials to those selected by the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility.
** Gas core EM reactor. As in the gas core reactor, but with photovoltaic arrays converting the UV light directly to electricity. This approach is similar to the experimentally proved photoelectric effect that would convert the X-rays generated from aneutronic fusion into electricity, by passing the high energy photons through an array of conducting foils to transfer some of their energy to electrons, the energy of the photon is captured electrostatically, similar to a capacitor. Since X-rays can go through far greater material thickness than electrons, many hundreds or thousands of layers are needed to absorb the X-rays.
* Fission fragment reactor. A fission fragment reactor is a nuclear reactor that generates electricity by decelerating an ion beam of fission byproducts instead of using nuclear reactions to generate heat. By doing so, it bypasses the Carnot cycle and can achieve efficiencies of up to 90% instead of 40–45% attainable by efficient turbine-driven thermal reactors. The fission fragment ion beam would be passed through a magnetohydrodynamic generator to produce electricity.
* Hybrid nuclear fusion. Would use the neutrons emitted by fusion to fission a blanket of fertile material, like U-238 or Th-232 and transmute other reactor&#x27;s spent nuclear fuel/nuclear waste into relatively more benign isotopes.

====Fusion reactors====

Controlled nuclear fusion could in principle be used in fusion power plants to produce power without the complexities of handling actinides, but significant scientific and technical obstacles remain. Despite research having started in the 1950s, no commercial fusion reactor is expected before 2050. The ITER project is currently leading the effort to harness fusion power.

==Nuclear fuel cycle==

Thermal reactors generally depend on refined and enriched uranium. Some nuclear reactors can operate with a mixture of plutonium and uranium (see MOX). The process by which uranium ore is mined, processed, enriched, used, possibly reprocessed and disposed of is known as the nuclear fuel cycle.

Under 1% of the uranium found in nature is the easily fissionable U-235 isotope and as a result most reactor designs require enriched fuel.
Enrichment involves increasing the percentage of U-235 and is usually done by means of gaseous diffusion or gas centrifuge. The enriched result is then converted into uranium dioxide powder, which is pressed and fired into pellet form. These pellets are stacked into tubes which are then sealed and called fuel rods. Many of these fuel rods are used in each nuclear reactor.

Most BWR and PWR commercial reactors use uranium enriched to about 4% U-235, and some commercial reactors with a high neutron economy do not require the fuel to be enriched at all (that is, they can use natural uranium). According to the International Atomic Energy Agency there are at least 100 research reactors in the world fueled by highly enriched (weapons-grade/90% enrichment) uranium. Theft risk of this fuel (potentially used in the production of a nuclear weapon) has led to campaigns advocating conversion of this type of reactor to low-enrichment uranium (which poses less threat of proliferation).

Fissile U-235 and non-fissile but fissionable and fertile U-238 are both used in the fission process. U-235 is fissionable by thermal (i.e. slow-moving) neutrons. A thermal neutron is one which is moving about the same speed as the atoms around it. Since all atoms vibrate proportionally to their absolute temperature, a thermal neutron has the best opportunity to fission U-235 when it is moving at this same vibrational speed. On the other hand, U-238 is more likely to capture a neutron when the neutron is moving very fast. This U-239 atom will soon decay into plutonium-239, which is another fuel. Pu-239 is a viable fuel and must be accounted for even when a highly enriched uranium fuel is used. Plutonium fissions will dominate the U-235 fissions in some reactors, especially after the initial loading of U-235 is spent. Plutonium is fissionable with both fast and thermal neutrons, which make it ideal for either nuclear reactors or nuclear bombs.

Most reactor designs in existence are thermal reactors and typically use water as a neutron moderator (moderator means that it slows down the neutron to a thermal speed) and as a coolant. But in a fast breeder reactor, some other kind of coolant is used which will not moderate or slow the neutrons down much. This enables fast neutrons to dominate, which can effectively be used to constantly replenish the fuel supply. By merely placing cheap unenriched uranium into such a core, the non-fissionable U-238 will be turned into Pu-239, &quot;breeding&quot; fuel.

In thorium fuel cycle thorium-232 absorbs a neutron in either a fast or thermal reactor. The thorium-233 beta decays to protactinium-233 and then to uranium-233, which in turn is used as fuel. Hence, like uranium-238, thorium-232 is a fertile material.

===Fueling of nuclear reactors===
The amount of energy in the reservoir of nuclear fuel is frequently expressed in terms of &quot;full-power days,&quot; which is the number of 24-hour periods (days) a reactor is scheduled for operation at full power output for the generation of heat energy. The number of full-power days in a reactor&#x27;s operating cycle (between refueling outage times) is related to the amount of fissile uranium-235 (U-235) contained in the fuel assemblies at the beginning of the cycle. A higher percentage of U-235 in the core at the beginning of a cycle will permit the reactor to be run for a greater number of full-power days.

At the end of the operating cycle, the fuel in some of the assemblies is &quot;spent&quot;, having spent four to six years in the reactor producing power. This spent fuel is discharged and replaced with new (fresh) fuel assemblies. Though considered &quot;spent,&quot; these fuel assemblies contain a large quantity of fuel. In practice it is economics that determines the lifetime of nuclear fuel in a reactor. Long before all possible fission has taken place, the reactor is unable to maintain 100%, full output power, and therefore, income for the utility lowers as plant output power lowers. Most nuclear plants operate at a very low profit margin due to operating overhead, mainly regulatory costs, so operating below 100% power is not economically viable for very long. The fraction of the reactor&#x27;s fuel core replaced during refueling is typically one-third, but depends on how long the plant operates between refueling. Plants typically operate on 18 month refueling cycles, or 24 month refueling cycles. This means that one refueling, replacing only one-third of the fuel, can keep a nuclear reactor at full power for nearly two years. 

The disposition and storage of this spent fuel is one of the most challenging aspects of the operation of a commercial nuclear power plant. This nuclear waste is highly radioactive and its toxicity presents a danger for thousands of years. After being discharged from the reactor, spent nuclear fuel is transferred to the on-site spent fuel pool. The spent fuel pool is a large pool of water that provides cooling and shielding of the spent nuclear fuel as well as limit radiation exposure to on-site personnel. Once the energy has decayed somewhat (approximately five years), the fuel can be transferred from the fuel pool to dry shielded casks, that can be safely stored for thousands of years. After loading into dry shielded casks, the casks are stored on-site in a specially guarded facility in impervious concrete bunkers. On-site fuel storage facilities are designed to withstand the impact of commercial airliners, with little to no damage to the spent fuel. An average on-site fuel storage facility can hold 30 years of spent fuel in a space smaller than a football field.

Not all reactors need to be shut down for refueling; for example, pebble bed reactors, RBMK reactors, molten-salt reactors, Magnox, AGR and CANDU reactors allow fuel to be shifted through the reactor while it is running. In a CANDU reactor, this also allows individual fuel elements to be situated within the reactor core that are best suited to the amount of U-235 in the fuel element.

The amount of energy extracted from nuclear fuel is called its burnup, which is expressed in terms of the heat energy produced per initial unit of fuel weight. Burnup is commonly expressed as megawatt days thermal per metric ton of initial heavy metal.

==Nuclear safety==
Nuclear safety covers the actions taken to prevent nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents or to limit their consequences. The nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors, and has proposed new, safer (but generally untested) reactor designs but there is no guarantee that the reactors will be designed, built and operated correctly. Mistakes do occur and the designers of reactors at Fukushima in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake, despite multiple warnings by the NRG and the Japanese nuclear safety administration. According to UBS AG, the Fukushima I nuclear accidents have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master nuclear safety. Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable. An interdisciplinary team from MIT has estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005 to 2055, at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period.

==Nuclear accidents==

Serious, though rare, nuclear and radiation accidents have occurred. These include the Windscale fire (October 1957), the SL-1 accident (1961), the Three Mile Island accident (1979), Chernobyl disaster (April 1986), and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (March 2011). Nuclear-powered submarine mishaps include the K-19 reactor accident (1961), the K-27 reactor accident (1968), and the K-431 reactor accident (1985).

Nuclear reactors have been launched into Earth orbit at least 34 times. A number of incidents connected with the unmanned nuclear-reactor-powered Soviet RORSAT especially Kosmos 954 radar satellite which resulted in nuclear fuel reentering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere from orbit and being dispersed in northern Canada (January 1978).

==Natural nuclear reactors==

Almost two billion years ago a series of self-sustaining nuclear fission &quot;reactors&quot; self-assembled in the area now known as Oklo in Gabon, West Africa. The conditions at that place and time allowed a natural nuclear fission to occur with circumstances that are similar to the conditions in a constructed nuclear reactor. Fifteen fossil natural fission reactors have so far been found in three separate ore deposits at the Oklo uranium mine in Gabon. First discovered in 1972 by French physicist Francis Perrin, they are collectively known as the Oklo Fossil Reactors. Self-sustaining nuclear fission reactions took place in these reactors approximately 1.5 billion years ago, and ran for a few hundred thousand years, averaging 100 kW of power output during that time. The concept of a natural nuclear reactor was theorized as early as 1956 by Paul Kuroda at the University of Arkansas.

Such reactors can no longer form on Earth in its present geologic period. Radioactive decay of formerly more abundant uranium-235 over the time span of hundreds of millions of years has reduced the proportion of this naturally occurring fissile isotope to below the amount required to sustain a chain reaction with only plain water as a moderator.

The natural nuclear reactors formed when a uranium-rich mineral deposit became inundated with groundwater that acted as a neutron moderator, and a strong chain reaction took place. The water moderator would boil away as the reaction increased, slowing it back down again and preventing a meltdown. The fission reaction was sustained for hundreds of thousands of years, cycling on the order of hours to a few days.

These natural reactors are extensively studied by scientists interested in geologic radioactive waste disposal. They offer a case study of how radioactive isotopes migrate through the Earth&#x27;s crust. This is a significant area of controversy as opponents of geologic waste disposal fear that isotopes from stored waste could end up in water supplies or be carried into the environment.

==Emissions==
Nuclear reactors produce tritium as part of normal operations, which is eventually released into the environment in trace quantities.

As an isotope of hydrogen, tritium (T) frequently binds to oxygen and forms T2O. This molecule is chemically identical to H2O and so is both colorless and odorless, however the additional neutrons in the hydrogen nuclei cause the tritium to undergo beta decay with a half-life of 12.3 years. Despite being measurable, the tritium released by nuclear power plants is minimal. The United States NRC estimates that a person drinking water for one year out of a well contaminated by what they would consider to be a significant tritiated water spill would receive a radiation dose of 0.3 millirem. For comparison, this is an order of magnitude less than the 4 millirem a person receives on a round trip flight from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, a consequence of less atmospheric protection against highly energetic cosmic rays at high altitudes.

The amounts of strontium-90 released from nuclear power plants under normal operations is so low as to be undetectable above natural background radiation. Detectable strontium-90 in ground water and the general environment can be traced to weapons testing that occurred during the mid-20th century (accounting for 99% of the Strontium-90 in the environment) and the Chernobyl accident (accounting for the remaining 1%).

<text>Nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactions to produce electricity. Nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions. Presently, the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power is produced by nuclear &quot;fission&quot; of uranium and plutonium in nuclear power plants. Nuclear &quot;decay&quot; processes are used in niche applications such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators in some space probes such as &quot;Voyager 2&quot;. Reactors producing controlled &quot;fusion&quot; power have been operated since 1958 but have yet to generate net power and are not expected to be commercially available in the near future.

The first nuclear power plant was built in the 1950s. The global installed nuclear capacity grew to 100GW in the late 1970s, and then expanded during the 1980s, reaching 300GW by 1990. The 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the United States and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union resulted in increased regulation and public opposition to nuclear power plants. Nuclear power plants supplied 2,602 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity in 2023, equivalent to about 9% of global electricity generation, and were the second largest low-carbon power source after hydroelectricity. there are 415 civilian fission reactors in the world, with overall capacity of 374GW, 66 under construction and 87 planned, with a combined capacity of 72GW and 84GW, respectively. The United States has the largest fleet of nuclear reactors, generating almost 800TWh of low-carbon electricity per year with an average capacity factor of 92%. The average global capacity factor is 89%. Most new reactors under construction are generation III reactors in Asia.

Nuclear power is a safe, sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions. This is because nuclear power generation causes one of the lowest levels of fatalities per unit of energy generated compared to other energy sources. &quot;Economists estimate that each nuclear plant built could save more than 800,000 life years.&quot; Coal, petroleum, natural gas and hydroelectricity have each caused more fatalities per unit of energy due to air pollution and accidents. Nuclear power plants also emit no greenhouse gases and result in less life-cycle carbon emissions than common &quot;renewables&quot;. The radiological hazards associated with nuclear power are the primary motivations of the anti-nuclear movement, which contends that nuclear power poses threats to people and the environment, citing the potential for accidents like the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011, and is too expensive to deploy when compared to alternative sustainable energy sources.

==History==
===Origins===

The process of nuclear fission was discovered in 1938 after over four decades of work on the science of radioactivity and the elaboration of new nuclear physics that described the components of atoms. Soon after the discovery of the fission process, it was realized that neutrons released by a fissioning nucleus could, under the right conditions, induce fissions in nearby nuclei, thus initiating a self-sustaining chain reaction. Once this was experimentally confirmed in 1939, scientists in many countries petitioned their governments for support for nuclear fission research, just on the cusp of World War II, in order to develop a nuclear weapon.

In the United States, these research efforts led to the creation of the first human-made nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1 under the Stagg Field stadium at the University of Chicago, which achieved criticality on December 2, 1942. The reactor&#x27;s development was part of the Manhattan Project, the Allied effort to create atomic bombs during World War II. It led to the building of larger single-purpose production reactors for the production of weapons-grade plutonium for use in the first nuclear weapons. The United States tested the first nuclear weapon in July 1945, the Trinity test, and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki happened one month later.

Despite the military nature of the first nuclear devices, there was strong optimism in the 1940s and 1950s that nuclear power could provide cheap and endless energy. Electricity was generated for the first time by a nuclear reactor on December 20, 1951, at the EBR-I experimental station near Arco, Idaho, which initially produced about 100kW. In 1953, American President Dwight Eisenhower gave his &quot;Atoms for Peace&quot; speech at the United Nations, emphasizing the need to develop &quot;peaceful&quot; uses of nuclear power quickly. This was followed by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 which allowed rapid declassification of U.S. reactor technology and encouraged development by the private sector.

===First power generation===
The first organization to develop practical nuclear power was the U.S. Navy, with the S1W reactor for the purpose of propelling submarines and aircraft carriers. The first nuclear-powered submarine, , was put to sea in January 1954. The S1W reactor was a pressurized water reactor. This design was chosen because it was simpler, more compact, and easier to operate compared to alternative designs, thus more suitable to be used in submarines. This decision would result in the PWR being the reactor of choice also for power generation, thus having a lasting impact on the civilian electricity market in the years to come.

On June 27, 1954, the Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant in the USSR became the world&#x27;s first nuclear power plant to generate electricity for a power grid, producing around 5 megawatts of electric power. The world&#x27;s first commercial nuclear power station, Calder Hall at Windscale, England was connected to the national power grid on 27 August 1956. In common with a number of other generation I reactors, the plant had the dual purpose of producing electricity and plutonium-239, the latter for the nascent nuclear weapons program in Britain.

===Expansion and first opposition===
The total global installed nuclear capacity initially rose relatively quickly, rising from less than 1 gigawatt (GW) in 1960 to 100GW in the late 1970s. During the 1970s and 1980s rising economic costs (related to extended construction times largely due to regulatory changes and pressure-group litigation) and falling fossil fuel prices made nuclear power plants then under construction less attractive. In the 1980s in the U.S. and 1990s in Europe, the flat electric grid growth and electricity liberalization also made the addition of large new baseload energy generators economically unattractive.

The 1973 oil crisis had a significant effect on countries, such as France and Japan, which had relied more heavily on oil for electric generation to invest in nuclear power. France would construct 25 nuclear power plants over the next 15 years, and as of 2019, 71% of French electricity was generated by nuclear power, the highest percentage by any nation in the world.

Some local opposition to nuclear power emerged in the United States in the early 1960s. In the late 1960s, some members of the scientific community began to express pointed concerns. These anti-nuclear concerns related to nuclear accidents, nuclear proliferation, nuclear terrorism and radioactive waste disposal. In the early 1970s, there were large protests about a proposed nuclear power plant in Wyhl, Germany. The project was cancelled in 1975. The anti-nuclear success at Wyhl inspired opposition to nuclear power in other parts of Europe and North America.

By the mid-1970s anti-nuclear activism gained a wider appeal and influence, and nuclear power began to become an issue of major public protest. In some countries, the nuclear power conflict &quot;reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies&quot;. The increased public hostility to nuclear power led to a longer license procurement process, more regulations and increased requirements for safety equipment, which made new construction much more expensive. In the United States, over 120 Light Water Reactor proposals were ultimately cancelled and the construction of new reactors ground to a halt. The 1979 accident at Three Mile Island with no fatalities, played a major part in the reduction in the number of new plant constructions in many countries.

===Chernobyl and renaissance===
During the 1980s one new nuclear reactor started up every 17 days on average. By the end of the decade, global installed nuclear capacity reached 300GW. Since the late 1980s, new capacity additions slowed significantly, with the installed nuclear capacity reaching 366GW in 2005.

The 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the USSR, involving an RBMK reactor, altered the development of nuclear power and led to a greater focus on meeting international safety and regulatory standards. It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history both in total casualties, with 56 direct deaths, and financially, with the cleanup and the cost estimated at 18billionRbls (US$68billion in 2019, adjusted for inflation). The international organization to promote safety awareness and the professional development of operators in nuclear facilities, the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO), was created as a direct outcome of the 1986 Chernobyl accident. The Chernobyl disaster played a major part in the reduction in the number of new plant constructions in the following years. Influenced by these events, Italy voted against nuclear power in a 1987 referendum, becoming the first country to completely phase out nuclear power in 1990.

In the early 2000s, nuclear energy was expecting a nuclear renaissance, an increase in the construction of new reactors, due to concerns about carbon dioxide emissions. During this period, newer generation III reactors, such as the EPR began construction.

===Fukushima accident===

Prospects of a nuclear renaissance were delayed by another nuclear accident. The 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident was caused by the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded. The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant suffered three core meltdowns due to failure of the emergency cooling system for lack of electricity supply. This resulted in the most serious nuclear accident since the Chernobyl disaster.

The accident prompted a re-examination of nuclear safety and nuclear energy policy in many countries. Germany approved plans to close all its reactors by 2022, and many other countries reviewed their nuclear power programs. Following the disaster, Japan shut down all of its nuclear power reactors, some of them permanently, and in 2015 began a gradual process to restart the remaining 40 reactors, following safety checks and based on revised criteria for operations and public approval.

In 2022, the Japanese government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, declared that 10 more nuclear power plants were to be reopened since the 2011 disaster. Kishida is also pushing for research and construction of new safer nuclear plants to safeguard Japanese consumers from the fluctuating price of the fossil fuel market and reduce Japan&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions. Kishida intends to have Japan become a significant exporter of nuclear energy and technology to developing countries around the world.

=== Current prospects ===
By 2015, the IAEA&#x27;s outlook for nuclear energy had become more promising, recognizing the importance of low-carbon generation for mitigating climate change. , the global trend was for new nuclear power stations coming online to be balanced by the number of old plants being retired. In 2016, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected for its &quot;base case&quot; that world nuclear power generation would increase from 2,344 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2012 to 4,500TWh in 2040. Most of the predicted increase was expected to be in Asia. As of 2018, there were over 150 nuclear reactors planned including 50 under construction. In January 2019, China had 45 reactors in operation, 13 under construction, and planned to build 43 more, which would make it the world&#x27;s largest generator of nuclear electricity. As of 2021, 17 reactors were reported to be under construction. China built significantly fewer reactors than originally planned. Its share of electricity from nuclear power was 5% in 2019 and observers have cautioned that, along with the risks, the changing economics of energy generation may cause new nuclear energy plants to &quot;no longer make sense in a world that is leaning toward cheaper, more reliable renewable energy&quot;.

In October 2021, the Japanese cabinet approved the new Plan for Electricity Generation to 2030 prepared by the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy (ANRE) and an advisory committee, following public consultation. The nuclear target for 2030 requires the restart of another ten reactors. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in July 2022 announced that the country should consider building advanced reactors and extending operating licences beyond 60 years.

As of 2022, with world oil and gas prices on the rise, while Germany is restarting its coal plants to deal with loss of Russian gas that it needs to supplement its , many other countries have announced ambitious plans to reinvigorate ageing nuclear generating capacity with new investments. French President Emmanuel Macron announced his intention to build six new reactors in coming decades, placing nuclear at the heart of France&#x27;s drive for carbon neutrality by 2050. Meanwhile, in the United States, the Department of Energy, in collaboration with commercial entities, TerraPower and X-energy, is planning on building two different advanced nuclear reactors by 2027, with further plans for nuclear implementation in its long term green energy and energy security goals.

== Power plants ==


Nuclear power plants are thermal power stations that generate electricity by harnessing the thermal energy released from nuclear fission. A fission nuclear power plant is generally composed of: a nuclear reactor, in which the nuclear reactions generating heat take place; a cooling system, which removes the heat from inside the reactor; a steam turbine, which transforms the heat into mechanical energy; an electric generator, which transforms the mechanical energy into electrical energy.

When a neutron hits the nucleus of a uranium-235 or plutonium atom, it can split the nucleus into two smaller nuclei, which is a nuclear fission reaction. The reaction releases energy and neutrons. The released neutrons can hit other uranium or plutonium nuclei, causing new fission reactions, which release more energy and more neutrons. This is called a chain reaction. In most commercial reactors, the reaction rate is contained by control rods that absorb excess neutrons. The controllability of nuclear reactors depends on the fact that a small fraction of neutrons resulting from fission are delayed. The time delay between the fission and the release of the neutrons slows changes in reaction rates and gives time for moving the control rods to adjust the reaction rate.

== Fuel cycle ==


The life cycle of nuclear fuel starts with uranium mining. The uranium ore is then converted into a compact ore concentrate form, known as yellowcake (U3O8), to facilitate transport. Fission reactors generally need uranium-235, a fissile isotope of uranium. The concentration of uranium-235 in natural uranium is low (about 0.7%). Some reactors can use this natural uranium as fuel, depending on their neutron economy. These reactors generally have graphite or heavy water moderators. For light water reactors, the most common type of reactor, this concentration is too low, and it must be increased by a process called uranium enrichment. In civilian light water reactors, uranium is typically enriched to 3.55% uranium-235. The uranium is then generally converted into uranium oxide (UO2), a ceramic, that is then compressively sintered into fuel pellets, a stack of which forms fuel rods of the proper composition and geometry for the particular reactor.

After some time in the reactor, the fuel will have reduced fissile material and increased fission products, until its use becomes impractical. At this point, the spent fuel will be moved to a spent fuel pool which provides cooling for the thermal heat and shielding for ionizing radiation. After several months or years, the spent fuel is radioactively and thermally cool enough to be moved to dry storage casks or reprocessed.

=== Uranium resources ===
Uranium is a fairly common element in the Earth&#x27;s crust: it is approximately as common as tin or germanium, and is about 40 times more common than silver. Uranium is present in trace concentrations in most rocks, dirt, and ocean water, but is generally economically extracted only where it is present in relatively high concentrations. Uranium mining can be underground, open-pit, or in-situ leach mining. An increasing number of the highest output mines are remote underground operations, such as McArthur River uranium mine, in Canada, which by itself accounts for 13% of global production. As of 2011 the world&#x27;s known resources of uranium, economically recoverable at the arbitrary price ceiling of US$130/kg, were enough to last for between 70 and 100 years. In 2007, the OECD estimated 670 years of economically recoverable uranium in total conventional resources and phosphate ores assuming the then-current use rate.

Light water reactors make relatively inefficient use of nuclear fuel, mostly using only the very rare uranium-235 isotope. Nuclear reprocessing can make this waste reusable, and newer reactors also achieve a more efficient use of the available resources than older ones. With a pure fast reactor fuel cycle with a burn up of all the uranium and actinides (which presently make up the most hazardous substances in nuclear waste), there is an estimated 160,000 years worth of uranium in total conventional resources and phosphate ore at the price of 60–100 US$/kg. However, reprocessing is expensive, possibly dangerous and can be used to manufacture nuclear weapons. One analysis found that uranium prices could increase by two orders of magnitude between 2035 and 2100 and that there could be a shortage near the end of the century. A 2017 study by researchers from MIT and WHOI found that &quot;at the current consumption rate, global conventional reserves of terrestrial uranium (approximately 7.6 million tonnes) could be depleted in a little over a century&quot;. Limited uranium-235 supply may inhibit substantial expansion with the current nuclear technology. While various ways to reduce dependence on such resources are being explored, new nuclear technologies are considered to not be available in time for climate change mitigation purposes or competition with alternatives of renewables in addition to being more expensive and require costly research and development. A study found it to be uncertain whether identified resources will be developed quickly enough to provide uninterrupted fuel supply to expanded nuclear facilities and various forms of mining may be challenged by ecological barriers, costs, and land requirements. Researchers also report considerable import dependence of nuclear energy.

Unconventional uranium resources also exist. Uranium is naturally present in seawater at a concentration of about 3 micrograms per liter, with 4.4 billion tons of uranium considered present in seawater at any time. In 2014 it was suggested that it would be economically competitive to produce nuclear fuel from seawater if the process was implemented at large scale. Like fossil fuels, over geological timescales, uranium extracted on an industrial scale from seawater would be replenished by both river erosion of rocks and the natural process of uranium dissolved from the surface area of the ocean floor, both of which maintain the solubility equilibria of seawater concentration at a stable level. Some commentators have argued that this strengthens the case for nuclear power to be considered a renewable energy.

=== Waste ===
The normal operation of nuclear power plants and facilities produce radioactive waste, or nuclear waste. This type of waste is also produced during plant decommissioning. There are two broad categories of nuclear waste: low-level waste and high-level waste. The first has low radioactivity and includes contaminated items such as clothing, which poses limited threat. High-level waste is mainly the spent fuel from nuclear reactors, which is very radioactive and must be cooled and then safely disposed of or reprocessed.

==== High-level waste ====


The most important waste stream from nuclear power reactors is spent nuclear fuel, which is considered high-level waste. For Light Water Reactors (LWRs), spent fuel is typically composed of 95% uranium, 4% fission products, and about 1% transuranic actinides (mostly plutonium, neptunium and americium). The fission products are responsible for the bulk of the short-term radioactivity, whereas the plutonium and other transuranics are responsible for the bulk of the long-term radioactivity.

High-level waste (HLW) must be stored isolated from the biosphere with sufficient shielding so as to limit radiation exposure. After being removed from the reactors, used fuel bundles are stored for six to ten years in spent fuel pools, which provide cooling and shielding against radiation. After that, the fuel is cool enough that it can be safely transferred to dry cask storage. The radioactivity decreases exponentially with time, such that it will have decreased by 99.5% after 100 years. The more intensely radioactive short-lived fission products (SLFPs) decay into stable elements in approximately 300 years, and after about 100,000 years, the spent fuel becomes less radioactive than natural uranium ore.

Commonly suggested methods to isolate LLFP waste from the biosphere include separation and transmutation, synroc treatments, or deep geological storage.

Thermal-neutron reactors, which presently constitute the majority of the world fleet, cannot burn up the reactor grade plutonium that is generated during the reactor operation. This limits the life of nuclear fuel to a few years. In some countries, such as the United States, spent fuel is classified in its entirety as a nuclear waste. In other countries, such as France, it is largely reprocessed to produce a partially recycled fuel, known as mixed oxide fuel or MOX. For spent fuel that does not undergo reprocessing, the most concerning isotopes are the medium-lived transuranic elements, which are led by reactor-grade plutonium (half-life 24,000 years). Some proposed reactor designs, such as the integral fast reactor and molten salt reactors, can use as fuel the plutonium and other actinides in spent fuel from light water reactors, thanks to their fast fission spectrum. This offers a potentially more attractive alternative to deep geological disposal.

The thorium fuel cycle results in similar fission products, though creates a much smaller proportion of transuranic elements from neutron capture events within a reactor. Spent thorium fuel, although more difficult to handle than spent uranium fuel, may present somewhat lower proliferation risks.

==== Low-level waste ====
The nuclear industry also produces a large volume of low-level waste, with low radioactivity, in the form of contaminated items like clothing, hand tools, water purifier resins, and (upon decommissioning) the materials of which the reactor itself is built. Low-level waste can be stored on-site until radiation levels are low enough to be disposed of as ordinary waste, or it can be sent to a low-level waste disposal site.

==== Waste relative to other types ====

In countries with nuclear power, radioactive wastes account for less than 1% of total industrial toxic wastes, much of which remains hazardous for long periods. Overall, nuclear power produces far less waste material by volume than fossil-fuel based power plants. Coal-burning plants, in particular, produce large amounts of toxic and mildly radioactive ash resulting from the concentration of naturally occurring radioactive materials in coal. A 2008 report from Oak Ridge National Laboratory concluded that coal power actually results in more radioactivity being released into the environment than nuclear power operation, and that the population effective dose equivalent from radiation from coal plants is 100 times that from the operation of nuclear plants. Although coal ash is much less radioactive than spent nuclear fuel by weight, coal ash is produced in much higher quantities per unit of energy generated. It is also released directly into the environment as fly ash, whereas nuclear plants use shielding to protect the environment from radioactive materials.

Nuclear waste volume is small compared to the energy produced. For example, at Yankee Rowe Nuclear Power Station, which generated 44 billion kilowatt hours of electricity when in service, its complete spent fuel inventory is contained within sixteen casks. It is estimated that to produce a lifetime supply of energy for a person at a western standard of living (approximately 3GWh) would require on the order of the volume of a soda can of low enriched uranium, resulting in a similar volume of spent fuel generated.

==== Waste disposal ====
Following interim storage in a spent fuel pool, the bundles of used fuel rod assemblies of a typical nuclear power station are often stored on site in dry cask storage vessels. Presently, waste is mainly stored at individual reactor sites and there are over 430 locations around the world where radioactive material continues to accumulate.

Disposal of nuclear waste is often considered the most politically divisive aspect in the lifecycle of a nuclear power facility. The lack of movement of nuclear waste in the 2 billion year old natural nuclear fission reactors in Oklo, Gabon is cited as &quot;a source of essential information today.&quot; Experts suggest that centralized underground repositories which are well-managed, guarded, and monitored, would be a vast improvement. There is an &quot;international consensus on the advisability of storing nuclear waste in deep geological repositories&quot;. With the advent of new technologies, other methods including horizontal drillhole disposal into geologically inactive areas have been proposed.
There are no commercial scale purpose built underground high-level waste repositories in operation. However, in Finland the Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository of the Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant was under construction as of 2015.

=== Reprocessing ===

Most thermal-neutron reactors run on a once-through nuclear fuel cycle, mainly due to the low price of fresh uranium. However, many reactors are also fueled with recycled fissionable materials that remain in spent nuclear fuel. The most common fissionable material that is recycled is the reactor-grade plutonium (RGPu) that is extracted from spent fuel. It is mixed with uranium oxide and fabricated into mixed-oxide or MOX fuel. Because thermal LWRs remain the most common reactor worldwide, this type of recycling is the most common. It is considered to increase the sustainability of the nuclear fuel cycle, reduce the attractiveness of spent fuel to theft, and lower the volume of high level nuclear waste. Spent MOX fuel cannot generally be recycled for use in thermal-neutron reactors. This issue does not affect fast-neutron reactors, which are therefore preferred in order to achieve the full energy potential of the original uranium.

The main constituent of spent fuel from LWRs is slightly enriched uranium. This can be recycled into reprocessed uranium (RepU), which can be used in a fast reactor, used directly as fuel in CANDU reactors, or re-enriched for another cycle through an LWR. Re-enriching of reprocessed uranium is common in France and Russia. Reprocessed uranium is also safer in terms of nuclear proliferation potential.

Reprocessing has the potential to recover up to 95% of the uranium and plutonium fuel in spent nuclear fuel, as well as reduce long-term radioactivity within the remaining waste. However, reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential for nuclear proliferation and varied perceptions of increasing the vulnerability to nuclear terrorism. Reprocessing also leads to higher fuel cost compared to the once-through fuel cycle. While reprocessing reduces the volume of high-level waste, it does not reduce the fission products that are the primary causes of residual heat generation and radioactivity for the first few centuries outside the reactor. Thus, reprocessed waste still requires an almost identical treatment for the initial first few hundred years.

Reprocessing of civilian fuel from power reactors is currently done in France, the United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, and India. In the United States, spent nuclear fuel is currently not reprocessed. The La Hague reprocessing facility in France has operated commercially since 1976 and is responsible for half the world&#x27;s reprocessing as of 2010. It produces MOX fuel from spent fuel derived from several countries. More than 32,000 tonnes of spent fuel had been reprocessed as of 2015, with the majority from France, 17% from Germany, and 9% from Japan.

=== Breeding ===
Breeding is the process of converting non-fissile material into fissile material that can be used as nuclear fuel. The non-fissile material that can be used for this process is called fertile material, and constitute the vast majority of current nuclear waste. This breeding process occurs naturally in breeder reactors. As opposed to light water thermal-neutron reactors, which use uranium-235 (0.7% of all natural uranium), fast-neutron breeder reactors use uranium-238 (99.3% of all natural uranium) or thorium. A number of fuel cycles and breeder reactor combinations are considered to be sustainable or renewable sources of energy. In 2006 it was estimated that with seawater extraction, there was likely five billion years&#x27; worth of uranium resources for use in breeder reactors.

Breeder technology has been used in several reactors, but as of 2006, the high cost of reprocessing fuel safely requires uranium prices of more than US$200/kg before becoming justified economically. Breeder reactors are however being developed for their potential to burn all of the actinides (the most active and dangerous components) in the present inventory of nuclear waste, while also producing power and creating additional quantities of fuel for more reactors via the breeding process. As of 2017, there are two breeders producing commercial power, BN-600 reactor and the BN-800 reactor, both in Russia. The Phénix breeder reactor in France was powered down in 2009 after 36 years of operation. Both China and India are building breeder reactors. The Indian 500 MWe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor is in the commissioning phase, with plans to build more.

Another alternative to fast-neutron breeders are thermal-neutron breeder reactors that use uranium-233 bred from thorium as fission fuel in the thorium fuel cycle. Thorium is about 3.5 times more common than uranium in the Earth&#x27;s crust, and has different geographic characteristics. India&#x27;s three-stage nuclear power programme features the use of a thorium fuel cycle in the third stage, as it has abundant thorium reserves but little uranium.

== Decommissioning ==

Nuclear decommissioning is the process of dismantling a nuclear facility to the point that it no longer requires measures for radiation protection, returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses. Due to the presence of radioactive materials, nuclear decommissioning presents technical and economic challenges. The costs of decommissioning are generally spread over the lifetime of a facility and saved in a decommissioning fund.

== Production ==


Civilian nuclear power supplied 2,602 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity in 2023, equivalent to about 9% of global electricity generation, and was the second largest low-carbon power source after hydroelectricity. Nuclear power&#x27;s contribution to global energy production was about 4% in 2023. This is a little more than wind power, which provided 3.5% of global energy in 2023. Nuclear power&#x27;s share of global electricity production has fallen from 16.5% in 1997, in large part because the economics of nuclear power have become more difficult.

 there are 415 civilian fission reactors in the world, with a combined electrical capacity of 374 gigawatt (GW). There are also 66 nuclear power reactors under construction and 87 reactors planned, with a combined capacity of 72GW and 84GW, respectively. The United States has the largest fleet of nuclear reactors, generating over 800TWh per year with an average capacity factor of 92%. Most reactors under construction are generation III reactors in Asia.

Regional differences in the use of nuclear power are large. The United States produces the most nuclear energy in the world, with nuclear power providing 19% of the electricity it consumes, while France produces the highest percentage of its electrical energy from nuclear reactors65% in 2023. In the European Union, nuclear power provides 22% of the electricity as of 2022.
Nuclear power is the single largest low-carbon electricity source in the United States, and accounts for about half of the European Union&#x27;s low-carbon electricity. Nuclear energy policy differs among European Union countries, and some, such as Austria, Estonia, Ireland and Italy, have no active nuclear power stations.

In addition, there were approximately 140 naval vessels using nuclear propulsion in operation, powered by about 180 reactors. These include military and some civilian ships, such as nuclear-powered icebreakers.

International research is continuing into additional uses of process heat such as hydrogen production (in support of a hydrogen economy), for desalinating sea water, and for use in district heating systems.

== Economics ==

The economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject and multi-billion-dollar investments depend on the choice of energy sources. Nuclear power plants typically have high capital costs for building the plant. For this reason, comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear plants. Fuel costs account for about 30 percent of the operating costs, while prices are subject to the market.

The high cost of construction is one of the biggest challenges for nuclear power plants. A new 1,100MW plant is estimated to cost between US$6 billion to US$9 billion. Nuclear power cost trends show large disparity by nation, design, build rate and the establishment of familiarity in expertise. The only two nations for which data is available that saw cost decreases in the 2000s were India and South Korea.

Analysis of the economics of nuclear power must also take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties. As of 2010, all operating nuclear power plants have been developed by state-owned or regulated electric utility monopolies. Many countries have since liberalized the electricity market where these risks, and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered, are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers, which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power plants.

The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from a new nuclear power plant is estimated to be 69USD/MWh, according to an analysis by the International Energy Agency and the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency. This represents the median cost estimate for an nth-of-a-kind nuclear power plant to be completed in 2025, at a discount rate of 7%. Nuclear power was found to be the least-cost option among dispatchable technologies. Variable renewables can generate cheaper electricity: the median cost of onshore wind power was estimated to be 50USD/MWh, and utility-scale solar power 56USD/MWh. At the assumed CO2 emission cost of 30USD/ton, power from coal (88USD/MWh) and gas (71USD/MWh) is more expensive than low-carbon technologies. Electricity from long-term operation of nuclear power plants by lifetime extension was found to be the least-cost option, at 32USD/MWh.

Measures to mitigate global warming, such as a carbon tax or carbon emissions trading, may favor the economics of nuclear power. Extreme weather events, including events made more severe by climate change, are decreasing all energy source reliability including nuclear energy by a small degree, depending on location siting.

New small modular reactors, such as those developed by NuScale Power, are aimed at reducing the investment costs for new construction by making the reactors smaller and modular, so that they can be built in a factory.

Certain designs had considerable early positive economics, such as the CANDU, which realized a much higher capacity factor and reliability when compared to generation II light water reactors up to the 1990s.

Nuclear power plants, though capable of some grid-load following, are typically run as much as possible to keep the cost of the generated electrical energy as low as possible, supplying mostly base-load electricity. Due to the on-line refueling reactor design, PHWRs (of which the CANDU design is a part) continue to hold many world record positions for longest continual electricity generation, often over 800 days. The specific record as of 2019 is held by a PHWR at Kaiga Atomic Power Station, generating electricity continuously for 962 days.

Costs not considered in LCOE calculations include funds for research and development, and disasters (the Fukushima disaster is estimated to cost taxpayers ≈$187 billion). In some cases, Governments were found to force &quot;consumers to pay upfront for potential cost overruns&quot; or subsidize uneconomic nuclear energy or be required to do so. Nuclear operators are liable to pay for the waste management in the European Union. In the U.S., the Congress reportedly decided 40 years ago that the nation, and not private companies, would be responsible for storing radioactive waste with taxpayers paying for the costs. The World Nuclear Waste Report 2019 found that &quot;even in countries in which the polluter-pays-principle is a legal requirement, it is applied incompletely&quot; and notes the case of the German Asse II deep geological disposal facility, where the retrieval of large amounts of waste has to be paid for by taxpayers. Similarly, other forms of energy, including fossil fuels and renewables, have a portion of their costs covered by governments.

== Use in space ==
The most common use of nuclear power in space is the use of radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which use radioactive decay to generate power. These power generators are relatively small scale (few kW), and they are mostly used to power space missions and experiments for long periods where solar power is not available in sufficient quantity, such as in the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; space probe. A few space vehicles have been launched using nuclear reactors: 34 reactors belong to the Soviet RORSAT series and one was the American SNAP-10A.

Both fission and fusion appear promising for space propulsion applications, generating higher mission velocities with less reaction mass.

== Safety ==
Nuclear power plants have three unique characteristics that affect their safety, as compared to other power plants. Firstly, intensely radioactive materials are present in a nuclear reactor. Their release to the environment could be hazardous. Secondly, the fission products, which make up most of the intensely radioactive substances in the reactor, continue to generate a significant amount of decay heat even after the fission chain reaction has stopped. If the heat cannot be removed from the reactor, the fuel rods may overheat and release radioactive materials. Thirdly, a criticality accident (a rapid increase of the reactor power) is possible in certain reactor designs if the chain reaction cannot be controlled. These three characteristics have to be taken into account when designing nuclear reactors.

All modern reactors are designed so that an uncontrolled increase of the reactor power is prevented by natural feedback mechanisms, a concept known as negative void coefficient of reactivity. If the temperature or the amount of steam in the reactor increases, the fission rate inherently decreases. The chain reaction can also be manually stopped by inserting control rods into the reactor core. Emergency core cooling systems (ECCS) can remove the decay heat from the reactor if normal cooling systems fail. If the ECCS fails, multiple physical barriers limit the release of radioactive materials to the environment even in the case of an accident. The last physical barrier is the large containment building.

With a death rate of 0.03 per TWh, nuclear power is the second safest energy source per unit of energy generated, after solar power, in terms of mortality when the historical track-record is considered. Energy produced by coal, petroleum, natural gas and hydropower has caused more deaths per unit of energy generated due to air pollution and energy accidents. This is found when comparing the immediate deaths from other energy sources to both the immediate and the latent, or predicted, indirect cancer deaths from nuclear energy accidents. When the direct and indirect fatalities (including fatalities resulting from the mining and air pollution) from nuclear power and fossil fuels are compared, the use of nuclear power has been calculated to have prevented about 1.84 million deaths from air pollution between 1971 and 2009, by reducing the proportion of energy that would otherwise have been generated by fossil fuels. Following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, it has been estimated that if Japan had never adopted nuclear power, accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life.

Serious impacts of nuclear accidents are often not directly attributable to radiation exposure, but rather social and psychological effects. Evacuation and long-term displacement of affected populations created problems for many people, especially the elderly and hospital patients. Forced evacuation from a nuclear accident may lead to social isolation, anxiety, depression, psychosomatic medical problems, reckless behavior, and suicide. A comprehensive 2005 study on the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster concluded that the mental health impact is the largest public health problem caused by the accident. Frank N. von Hippel, an American scientist, commented that a disproportionate fear of ionizing radiation (radiophobia) could have long-term psychological effects on the population of contaminated areas following the Fukushima disaster.

=== Accidents ===


Some serious nuclear and radiation accidents have occurred. The severity of nuclear accidents is generally classified using the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) introduced by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The scale ranks anomalous events or accidents on a scale from 0 (a deviation from normal operation that poses no safety risk) to 7 (a major accident with widespread effects). There have been three accidents of level 5 or higher in the civilian nuclear power industry, two of which, the Chernobyl accident and the Fukushima accident, are ranked at level 7.

The first major nuclear accidents were the Kyshtym disaster in the Soviet Union and the Windscale fire in the United Kingdom, both in 1957. The first major accident at a nuclear reactor in the USA occurred in 1961 at the SL-1, a U.S. Army experimental nuclear power reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory. An uncontrolled chain reaction resulted in a steam explosion which killed the three crew members and caused a meltdown. Another serious accident happened in 1968, when one of the two liquid-metal-cooled reactors on board the underwent a fuel element failure, with the emission of gaseous fission products into the surrounding air, resulting in 9 crew fatalities and 83 injuries.

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident was caused by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. The accident has not caused any radiation-related deaths but resulted in radioactive contamination of surrounding areas. The difficult cleanup operation is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars over 40 or more years. The Three Mile Island accident in 1979 was a smaller scale accident, rated at INES level 5. There were no direct or indirect deaths caused by the accident.

The impact of nuclear accidents is controversial. According to Benjamin K. Sovacool, fission energy accidents ranked first among energy sources in terms of their total economic cost, accounting for 41% of all property damage attributed to energy accidents. Another analysis found that coal, oil, liquid petroleum gas and hydroelectric accidents (primarily due to the Banqiao Dam disaster) have resulted in greater economic impacts than nuclear power accidents. The study compares latent cancer deaths attributable to nuclear power with immediate deaths from other energy sources per unit of energy generated, and does not include fossil fuel related cancer and other indirect deaths created by the use of fossil fuel consumption in its &quot;severe accident&quot; (an accident with more than five fatalities) classification. The Chernobyl accident in 1986 caused approximately 50 deaths from direct and indirect effects, and some temporary serious injuries from acute radiation syndrome. The future predicted mortality from increases in cancer rates is estimated at 4000 in the decades to come. However, the costs have been large and are increasing.

Nuclear power works under an insurance framework that limits or structures accident liabilities in accordance with national and international conventions. It is often argued that this potential shortfall in liability represents an external cost not included in the cost of nuclear electricity. This cost is small, amounting to about 0.1% of the levelized cost of electricity, according to a study by the Congressional Budget Office in the United States. These beyond-regular insurance costs for worst-case scenarios are not unique to nuclear power. Hydroelectric power plants are similarly not fully insured against a catastrophic event such as dam failures. For example, the failure of the Banqiao Dam caused the death of an estimated 30,000 to 200,000 people, and 11 million people lost their homes. As private insurers base dam insurance premiums on limited scenarios, major disaster insurance in this sector is likewise provided by the state.

=== Attacks and sabotage ===

Terrorists could target nuclear power plants in an attempt to release radioactive contamination into the community. The United States 9/11 Commission has said that nuclear power plants were potential targets originally considered for the September 11, 2001 attacks. An attack on a reactor&#x27;s spent fuel pool could also be serious, as these pools are less protected than the reactor core. The release of radioactivity could lead to thousands of near-term deaths and greater numbers of long-term fatalities.

In the United States, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission carries out &quot;Force on Force&quot; (FOF) exercises at all nuclear power plant sites at least once every three years. In the United States, plants are surrounded by a double row of tall fences which are electronically monitored. The plant grounds are patrolled by a sizeable force of armed guards.

Insider sabotage is also a threat because insiders can observe and work around security measures. Successful insider crimes depended on the perpetrators&#x27; observation and knowledge of security vulnerabilities. A fire caused 5–10 million dollars worth of damage to New York&#x27;s Indian Point Energy Center in 1971. The arsonist was a plant maintenance worker.

== Proliferation ==


Nuclear proliferation is the spread of nuclear weapons, fissionable material, and weapons-related nuclear technology to states that do not already possess nuclear weapons. Many technologies and materials associated with the creation of a nuclear power program have a dual-use capability, in that they can also be used to make nuclear weapons. For this reason, nuclear power presents proliferation risks.

Nuclear power program can become a route leading to a nuclear weapon. An example of this is the concern over Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. The re-purposing of civilian nuclear industries for military purposes would be a breach of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, to which 190 countries adhere. As of April 2012, there are thirty one countries that have civil nuclear power plants, of which nine have nuclear weapons. The vast majority of these nuclear weapons states have produced weapons before commercial nuclear power stations.

A fundamental goal for global security is to minimize the nuclear proliferation risks associated with the expansion of nuclear power. The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership was an international effort to create a distribution network in which developing countries in need of energy would receive nuclear fuel at a discounted rate, in exchange for that nation agreeing to forgo their own indigenous development of a uranium enrichment program. The France-based Eurodif/&quot;European Gaseous Diffusion Uranium Enrichment Consortium&quot; is a program that successfully implemented this concept, with Spain and other countries without enrichment facilities buying a share of the fuel produced at the French-controlled enrichment facility, but without a transfer of technology. Iran was an early participant from 1974 and remains a shareholder of Eurodif via Sofidif.

A 2009 United Nations report said that:
the revival of interest in nuclear power could result in the worldwide dissemination of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing technologies, which present obvious risks of proliferation as these technologies can produce fissile materials that are directly usable in nuclear weapons.

On the other hand, power reactors can also reduce nuclear weapon arsenals when military-grade nuclear materials are reprocessed to be used as fuel in nuclear power plants. The Megatons to Megawatts Program is considered the single most successful non-proliferation program to date. Up to 2005, the program had processed $8 billion of high enriched, weapons-grade uranium into low enriched uranium suitable as nuclear fuel for commercial fission reactors by diluting it with natural uranium. This corresponds to the elimination of 10,000 nuclear weapons. For approximately two decades, this material generated nearly 10 percent of all the electricity consumed in the United States, or about half of all U.S. nuclear electricity, with a total of around 7,000TWh of electricity produced. In total it is estimated to have cost $17 billion, a &quot;bargain for US ratepayers&quot;, with Russia profiting $12 billion from the deal. Much needed profit for the Russian nuclear oversight industry, which after the collapse of the Soviet economy, had difficulties paying for the maintenance and security of the Russian Federation&#x27;s highly enriched uranium and warheads. The Megatons to Megawatts Program was hailed as a major success by anti-nuclear weapon advocates as it has largely been the driving force behind the sharp reduction in the number of nuclear weapons worldwide since the cold war ended. However, without an increase in nuclear reactors and greater demand for fissile fuel, the cost of dismantling and down blending has dissuaded Russia from continuing their disarmament. As of 2013, Russia appears to not be interested in extending the program.

== Environmental impact ==
Being a low-carbon energy source with relatively little land-use requirements, nuclear energy can have a positive environmental impact. It also requires a constant supply of significant amounts of water and affects the environment through mining and milling.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.3390/ijerph13070700&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Its largest potential negative impacts on the environment may arise from its transgenerational risks for nuclear weapons proliferation that may increase risks of their use in the future, risks for problems associated with the management of the radioactive waste such as groundwater contamination, risks for accidents and for risks for various forms of attacks on waste storage sites or reprocessing- and power-plants. However, these remain mostly only risks as historically there have only been few disasters at nuclear power plants with known relatively substantial environmental impacts.

=== Carbon emissions ===

Nuclear power is one of the leading low carbon power generation methods of producing electricity, and in terms of total life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy generated, has emission values comparable to or lower than renewable energy. A 2014 analysis of the carbon footprint literature by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that the embodied total life-cycle emission intensity of nuclear power has a median value of 12g eq/kWh, which is the lowest among all commercial baseload energy sources. This is contrasted with coal and natural gas at 820 and 490 g eq/kWh. As of 2021, nuclear reactors worldwide have helped avoid the emission of 72 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide since 1970, compared to coal-fired electricity generation, according to a report.

=== Radiation ===
The average dose from natural background radiation is 2.4 millisievert per year (mSv/a) globally. It varies between 1mSv/a and 13mSv/a, depending mostly on the geology of the location. According to the United Nations (UNSCEAR), regular nuclear power plant operations, including the nuclear fuel cycle, increases this amount by 0.0002mSv/a of public exposure as a global average. The average dose from operating nuclear power plants to the local populations around them is less than 0.0001mSv/a. For comparison, the average dose to those living within of a coal power plant is over three times this dose, at 0.0003mSv/a.

Chernobyl resulted in the most affected surrounding populations and male recovery personnel receiving an average initial 50 to 100mSv over a few hours to weeks, while the remaining global legacy of the worst nuclear power plant accident in average exposure is 0.002mSv/a and is continuously dropping at the decaying rate, from the initial high of 0.04mSv per person averaged over the entire populace of the Northern Hemisphere in the year of the accident in 1986.

== Debate ==

The nuclear power debate concerns the controversy which has surrounded the deployment and use of nuclear fission reactors to generate electricity from nuclear fuel for civilian purposes.

Proponents of nuclear energy regard it as a sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions and increases energy security by decreasing dependence on other energy sources that are also&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.enpol.2018.12.024&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.anucene.2017.08.019&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1002/ente.201600444&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; often dependent on imports. For example, proponents note that annually, nuclear-generated electricity reduces 470 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions that would otherwise come from fossil fuels. Additionally, the amount of comparatively low waste that nuclear energy does create is safely disposed of by the large scale nuclear energy production facilities or it is repurposed/recycled for other energy uses. M. King Hubbert, who popularized the concept of peak oil, saw oil as a resource that would run out and considered nuclear energy its replacement. Proponents also claim that the present quantity of nuclear waste is small and can be reduced through the latest technology of newer reactors and that the operational safety record of fission-electricity in terms of deaths is so far &quot;unparalleled&quot;. Kharecha and Hansen estimated that &quot;global nuclear power has prevented an average of 1.84 million air pollution-related deaths and 64 gigatonnes of CO2-equivalent (Gt-eq) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that would have resulted from fossil fuel burning&quot; and, if continued, it could prevent up to 7 million deaths and 240Gt-eq emissions by 2050.

Proponents also bring to attention the opportunity cost of using other forms of electricity. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that coal kills 30,000 people a year, as a result of its environmental impact, while 60 people died in the Chernobyl disaster. A real world example of impact provided by proponents is the 650,000 ton increase in carbon emissions in the two months following the closure of the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant.

Opponents believe that nuclear power poses many threats to people&#x27;s health and environment such as the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation, long-term safe waste management and terrorism in the future. They also contend that nuclear power plants are complex systems where many things can and have gone wrong. Costs of the Chernobyl disaster amount to ≈$68 billion as of 2019 and are increasing, the Fukushima disaster is estimated to cost taxpayers ~$187 billion, and radioactive waste management is estimated to cost the Eureopean Union nuclear operators ~$250 billion by 2050. However, in countries that already use nuclear energy, when not considering reprocessing, intermediate nuclear waste disposal costs could be relatively fixed to certain but unknown degrees &quot;as the main part of these costs stems from the operation of the intermediate storage facility&quot;.

Critics find that one of the largest drawbacks to building new nuclear fission power plants are the large construction and operating costs when compared to alternatives of sustainable energy sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.erss.2014.04.015&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;10.5281/zenodo.5573718&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.enpol.2016.03.012&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1177/2399654418777765&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Further costs include ongoing research and development, expensive reprocessing in cases where such is practiced and decommissioning.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.rser.2021.110836&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents note that focussing on the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), however, ignores the value premium associated with 24/7 dispatchable electricity and the cost of storage and backup systems necessary to integrate variable energy sources into a reliable electrical grid. &quot;Nuclear thus remains the dispatchable low-carbon technology with the lowest expected costs in 2025. Only large hydro reservoirs can provide a similar contribution at comparable costs but remain highly dependent on the natural endowments of individual countries.&quot;

Overall, many opponents find that nuclear energy cannot meaningfully contribute to climate change mitigation. In general, they find it to be, too dangerous, too expensive, to take too long for deployment, to be an obstacle to achieving a transition towards sustainability and carbon-neutrality, effectively being a distracting competition for resources (i.e. human, financial, time, infrastructure and expertise) for the deployment and development of alternative, sustainable, energy system technologies (such as for wind, ocean and solar – including e.g. floating solar – as well as ways to manage their intermittency other than nuclear baseload generation such as dispatchable generation, renewables-diversification,&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.esr.2019.01.007&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; super grids, flexible energy demand and supply regulating smart grids and energy storage technologies).&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.enpol.2016.04.013&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there is ongoing research and debate over costs of new nuclear, especially in regions where i.a. seasonal energy storage is difficult to provide and which aim to phase out fossil fuels in favor of low carbon power faster than the global average. Some find that financial transition costs for a 100% renewables-based European energy system that has completely phased out nuclear energy could be more costly by 2050 based on current technologies (i.e. not considering potential advances in e.g. green hydrogen, transmission and flexibility capacities, ways to reduce energy needs, geothermal energy and fusion energy) when the grid only extends across Europe. Arguments of economics and safety are used by both sides of the debate.

=== Comparison with renewable energy ===
Slowing global warming requires a transition to a low-carbon economy, mainly by burning far less fossil fuel. Limiting global warming to 1.5°C is technically possible if no new fossil fuel power plants are built from 2019. This has generated considerable interest and dispute in determining the best path forward to rapidly replace fossil-based fuels in the global energy mix, with intense academic debate. Sometimes the IEA says that countries without nuclear should develop it as well as their renewable power.
Several studies suggest that it might be theoretically possible to cover a majority of world energy generation with new renewable sources. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has said that if governments were supportive, renewable energy supply could account for close to 80% of the world&#x27;s energy use by 2050. While in developed nations the economically feasible geography for new hydropower is lacking, with every geographically suitable area largely already exploited, some proponents of wind and solar energy claim these resources alone could eliminate the need for nuclear power.

Nuclear power is comparable to, and in some cases lower, than many renewable energy sources in terms of lives lost in the past per unit of electricity delivered. Depending on recycling of renewable energy technologies, nuclear reactors may produce a much smaller volume of waste, although much more toxic, expensive to manage and longer-lived. A nuclear plant also needs to be disassembled and removed and much of the disassembled nuclear plant needs to be stored as low-level nuclear waste for a few decades. The disposal and management of the wide variety of radioactive waste, of which there are over one quarter of a million tons as of 2018, can cause future damage and costs across the world for over or during hundreds of thousands of years – possibly over a million years, due to issues such as leakage, malign retrieval, vulnerability to attacks (including of reprocessing and power plants), groundwater contamination, radiation and leakage to above ground, brine leakage or bacterial corrosion. The European Commission Joint Research Centre found that as of 2021 the necessary technologies for geological disposal of nuclear waste are now available and can be deployed. Corrosion experts noted in 2020 that putting the problem of storage off any longer &quot;isn&#x27;t good for anyone&quot;. Separated plutonium and enriched uranium could be used for nuclear weapons, which – even with the current centralized control (e.g. state-level) and level of prevalence – are considered to be a difficult and substantial global risk for substantial future impacts on human health, lives, civilization and the environment.

====Speed of transition and investment needed====
Analysis in 2015 by professor Barry W. Brook and colleagues found that nuclear energy could displace or remove fossil fuels from the electric grid completely within 10 years. This finding was based on the historically modest and proven rate at which nuclear energy was added in France and Sweden during their building programs in the 1980s. In a similar analysis, Brook had earlier determined that 50% of all global energy, including transportation synthetic fuels etc., could be generated within approximately 30 years if the global nuclear fission build rate was identical to historical proven installation rates calculated in GW per year per unit of global GDP (GW/year/$). This is in contrast to the conceptual studies for 100% renewable energy systems, which would require an order of magnitude more costly global investment per year, which has no historical precedent. These renewable scenarios would also need far greater land devoted to onshore wind and onshore solar projects. Brook notes that the &quot;principal limitations on nuclear fission are not technical, economic or fuel-related, but are instead linked to complex issues of societal acceptance, fiscal and political inertia, and inadequate critical evaluation of the real-world constraints facing [the other] low-carbon alternatives.&quot;

Scientific data indicates that – assuming 2021 emissions levels – humanity only has a carbon budget equivalent to 11 years of emissions left for limiting warming to 1.5°C while the construction of new nuclear reactors took a median of 7.2–10.9 years in 2018–2020, substantially longer than, alongside other measures, scaling up the deployment of wind and solar – especially for novel reactor types – as well as being more risky, often delayed and more dependent on state-support. Researchers have cautioned that novel nuclear technologies – which have been in development since decades, are less tested, have higher proliferation risks, have more new safety problems, are often far from commercialization and are more expensive – are not available in time.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1080/00963402.2021.1941600&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of nuclear energy often only oppose nuclear fission energy but not nuclear fusion; however, fusion energy is unlikely to be commercially widespread before 2050.

====Land use====
The median land area used by US nuclear power stations per 1GW installed capacity is . To generate the same amount of electricity annually (taking into account capacity factors) from solar PV would require about , and from a wind farm about . Not included in this, is land required for the associated transmission lines, water supply, rail lines, mining and processing of nuclear fuel, and for waste disposal.

==Research==
===Advanced fission reactor designs===
Current fission reactors in operation around the world are second or third generation systems, with most of the first-generation systems having been already retired. Research into advanced generation IV reactor types was officially started by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) based on eight technology goals, including to improve economics, safety, proliferation resistance, natural resource use and the ability to consume existing nuclear waste in the production of electricity. Most of these reactors differ significantly from current operating light water reactors, and are expected to be available for commercial construction after 2030.

=== Hybrid fusion-fission ===

Hybrid nuclear power is a proposed means of generating power by the use of a combination of nuclear fusion and fission processes. The concept dates to the 1950s and was briefly advocated by Hans Bethe during the 1970s, but largely remained unexplored until a revival of interest in 2009, due to delays in the realization of pure fusion. When a sustained nuclear fusion power plant is built, it has the potential to be capable of extracting all the fission energy that remains in spent fission fuel, reducing the volume of nuclear waste by orders of magnitude, and more importantly, eliminating all actinides present in the spent fuel, substances which cause security concerns.

=== Fusion ===
Nuclear fusion reactions have the potential to be safer and generate less radioactive waste than fission. These reactions appear potentially viable, though technically quite difficult and have yet to be created on a scale that could be used in a functional power plant. Fusion power has been under theoretical and experimental investigation since the 1950s. Nuclear fusion research is underway but fusion energy is not likely to be commercially widespread before 2050.

Several experimental nuclear fusion reactors and facilities exist. The largest and most ambitious international nuclear fusion project currently in progress is ITER, a large tokamak under construction in France. ITER is planned to pave the way for commercial fusion power by demonstrating self-sustained nuclear fusion reactions with positive energy gain. Construction of the ITER facility began in 2007, but the project has run into many delays and budget overruns. The facility is now not expected to begin operations until the year 2027 – 11 years after initially anticipated. A follow on commercial nuclear fusion power station, DEMO, has been proposed. There are also suggestions for a power plant based upon a different fusion approach, that of an inertial fusion power plant.

Fusion-powered electricity generation was initially believed to be readily achievable, as fission-electric power had been. However, the extreme requirements for continuous reactions and plasma containment led to projections being extended by several decades. In 2020, more than 80 years after the first attempts, commercialization of fusion power production was thought to be unlikely before 2050.

To enhance and accelerate the development of fusion energy, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) granted $46 million to eight firms, including Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Tokamak Energy Inc, in 2023. This ambitious initiative aims to introduce pilot-scale fusion within a decade.

<text>BI Norwegian Business School () is a Norwegian specialized university that provides education and conducts research primarily in the fields of business and economics, marketing, strategy, management, and administration. BI is organized as a self-owned foundation whose sole purpose is teaching and research. With over 20,000 students, BI&#x27;s main campus is located in Nydalen, Oslo, with regional campuses in Bergen, Trondheim, and Stavanger.  

For several years, BI has been ranked as Norway&#x27;s top business school by the Financial Times European Business School Ranking. BI also participates in several of Financial Times&#x27; sub-rankings, including Executive MBA, Executive Education, and Master&#x27;s in management.

==History==
BI Norwegian Business School was founded by Finn Øien on 1 June 1943, as a private evening school in &quot;trade and office subjects&quot;. Together with his partner, Jens Rosef, Finn Øien was responsible for administration, teaching, and journals, while Rosef was in charge of the accounting and auditing consultancy department. The following year, Nils Skott joined as a third owner, with responsibility for the rationalization department.

1943-1979

The first course in business administration at BI was conducted in the evenings and lasted for three months. From 1946, the school established a full-time economics study program that lasted for two years. BI developed as a provider of short, independent courses in accounting, industrial bookkeeping, machine bookkeeping, and corporate statistics.  

In 1968, BI was reorganized from a privately owned corporation to a self-owned foundation. In 1969, the Norwegian Parliament decided to provide state funding to BI.  

In the 1960s and early 1970s, the entire higher education system in Norway was undergoing several changes. There was a significant increase in the number of students, and several regional colleges were established. In the 1960s and 1970s, BI established a regional network of local schools offering studies in business administration.

1980-2000

In the 1980s, there was a high demand for economic administrative education in Norway. BI experienced a significant increase in students, and its revenue grew tenfold. In 1986, over 12,000 applied to study business administration at BI.  

During the 1980s, the management at BI set the goal to develop BI as a specialized university. Academicization and increased efficiency were key aspects, and in 1983, BI hired its first professors. Research activity was also strengthened during this period.  

In 1985, BI decided to establish a national network of local branches. Former partner schools were either being closed down or incorporated into BI&#x27;s organization. That same year, BI obtained the right to award the title of Master of Science in business (Siviløkonom), which was crucial for BI&#x27;s recognition as a business school.  

In the 1990s, the ambition was to make BI a leading business school in Europe. In 1993, BI established its doctoral program in collaboration with the University of Oslo and Copenhagen Business School. Later on, BI also established educational programs in Shanghai, China, and in 2000, it did the same in Lithuania.

2001 →
In 2005, BI&#x27;s campuses in Sandvika, Schous plass, and Ekeberg were consolidated into a new campus in Nydalen, Oslo.

At the same time, it was decided to focus BI&#x27;s studies around business and economics, marketing, strategy, management, and administration. The number of campuses decreased from twelve to three. The number of bachelor&#x27;s programs was also reduced from 19 to 13, and the number of Master of Science programs from 8 to 5.  

In 2014, BI became the first business school in Norway to achieve the three most prestigious international accreditations, EQUIS, AACSB, and AMBA. With this, BI joined the one percent of business schools worldwide that can be referred to as a &quot;Triple Crown&quot; school.  

In 2022, BI appointed Finnish Karen Spens as the new president. With this, she became BI&#x27;s first female and international rector.

== Accreditations ==

* European Quality Improvement Systems (EQUIS)
* The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)
* The Association of MBAs (AMBA)

Schools that hold these three accreditations are referred to as &quot;Triple Crown&quot; schools.

=== Other accreditations ===

* Accreditation as a specialized university by the Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in Education (NOKUT).
* Online Course Certification System (EOCCS).

== Study programmes ==
BI Norwegian Business School offers education at all levels, including bachelor&#x27;s degree, master&#x27;s degree, doctoral degree, and postgraduate education. The education covers areas such as economics, finance, management, marketing, communication, HR, real estate, law, data, and digital business. BI also offers an MBA program in collaboration with Fudan University School of Management, China.

=== Student Association ===
BISO, BI Student Organization, is the student association for all students at BI. BISO develops student politics and works on important student issues. They represent the students in various collaborative forums with BI and organize welfare measures and events such as company presentations, social gatherings, and the Fadderullan (orientation program) at the beginning of the academic year.

BISO has multiple subject associations, as well as various interest groups. In addition, BISO is a co-owner of StudConsult, a consulting company operated by students affiliated with BI Norwegian Business School.

<doc id="22158" wikidata="Q1364891" url="?curid=22158" title="Nuclear proliferation">
<text>Nuclear proliferation is the spread of nuclear weapons, fissile material, and weapons-applicable nuclear technology and information to nations not recognized as &quot;Nuclear Weapon States&quot; by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, commonly known as the &quot;Non-Proliferation Treaty&quot; or &quot;NPT&quot;. Proliferation has been opposed by many nations with and without nuclear weapons, as governments fear that more countries with nuclear weapons will increase the possibility of nuclear warfare (up to and including the so-called countervalue targeting of civilians with nuclear weapons), de-stabilize international or regional relations, or infringe upon the national sovereignty of nation states.

Four countries besides the five recognized Nuclear Weapon States have acquired, or are presumed to have acquired, nuclear weapons: India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel. None of these four are a party to the NPT, although North Korea acceded to the NPT in 1985, then withdrew in 2003 and conducted its first nuclear test in 2006. One critique of the NPT is that the treaty is discriminatory in the sense that only those countries that tested nuclear weapons before 1968 are recognized as nuclear weapon states while all other states are treated as non-nuclear-weapon states who can only join the treaty if they forswear nuclear weapons.

Research into the development of nuclear weapons was initially undertaken during World War II by the United States (in cooperation with the United Kingdom and Canada), Germany, Japan, and the USSR. The United States was the first and is the only country to have used a nuclear weapon in war, when it used two bombs against Japan in August 1945. After surrendering to end the war, Germany and Japan ceased to be involved in any nuclear weapon research. In August 1949, the USSR tested a nuclear weapon, becoming the second country to detonate a nuclear bomb. The United Kingdom first tested a nuclear weapon in October 1952. France first tested a nuclear weapon in 1960. The People&#x27;s Republic of China detonated a nuclear weapon in 1964. India conducted its first nuclear test in 1974, which prompted Pakistan to develop its own nuclear program and, when India conducted a second series of nuclear tests in 1998, Pakistan followed with a series of tests of its own. In 2006, North Korea conducted its first nuclear test.

==Non-proliferation Efforts==
Early efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation involved intense government secrecy, the wartime acquisition of known uranium stores (the Combined Development Trust), and at times even outright sabotage—such as the bombing of a heavy-water facility in Norway thought to be used for a German nuclear program. These efforts began immediately after the discovery of nuclear fission and its military potential. None of these efforts were explicitly public, because the weapon developments themselves were kept secret until the bombing of Hiroshima.

Earnest international efforts to promote nuclear non-proliferation began soon after World War II, when the Truman Administration proposed the Baruch Plan of 1946, named after Bernard Baruch, America&#x27;s first representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission (UNAEC). The Baruch Plan, which drew heavily from the Acheson–Lilienthal Report of 1946, proposed the verifiable dismantlement and destruction of the U.S. nuclear arsenal (which, at that time, was the only nuclear arsenal in the world) after all governments had cooperated successfully to accomplish two things: (1) the establishment of an &quot;international atomic development authority,&quot; which would actually own and control all military-applicable nuclear materials and activities, and (2) the creation of a system of automatic sanctions, which not even the U.N. Security Council could veto, and which would proportionately punish states attempting to acquire the capability to make nuclear weapons or fissile material.

Baruch&#x27;s plea for the destruction of nuclear weapons invoked basic moral and religious intuitions. In one part of his address to the UN, Baruch said, &quot;Behind the black portent of the new atomic age lies a hope which, seized upon with faith, can work out our salvation. If we fail, then we have damned every man to be the slave of Fear. Let us not deceive ourselves. We must elect World Peace or World Destruction... We must answer the world&#x27;s longing for peace and security.&quot; With this remark, Baruch helped launch the field of nuclear ethics, to which many policy experts and scholars have contributed.

Although the Baruch Plan enjoyed wide international support, it failed to emerge from the UNAEC because the Soviet Union planned to veto it in the Security Council. Still, it remained official American policy until 1953, when President Eisenhower made his &quot;Atoms for Peace&quot; proposal before the U.N. General Assembly. Eisenhower&#x27;s proposal led eventually to the creation of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 1957. Under the &quot;Atoms for Peace&quot; program thousands of scientists from around the world were educated in nuclear science and then dispatched home, where many later pursued secret weapons programs in their home country.

Efforts to conclude an international agreement to limit the spread of nuclear weapons did not begin until the early 1960s, after four nations (the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and France) had acquired nuclear weapons (see List of states with nuclear weapons for more information). Although these efforts stalled in the early 1960s, they renewed once again in 1964, after China detonated a nuclear weapon. In 1968, governments represented at the Eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee (ENDC) finished negotiations on the text of the NPT. In June 1968, the U.N. General Assembly endorsed the NPT with General Assembly Resolution 2373 (XXII), and in July 1968, the NPT opened for signature in Washington, D.C., London and Moscow. The NPT entered into force in March 1970.

Since the mid-1970s, the primary focus of non-proliferation efforts has been to maintain, and even increase, international control over the fissile material and specialized technologies necessary to build such devices because these are the most difficult and expensive parts of a nuclear weapons program. The main materials whose generation and distribution are controlled are highly enriched uranium and plutonium. Other than the acquisition of these special materials, the scientific and technical means for weapons construction to develop rudimentary, but working, nuclear explosive devices are considered to be within the reach of industrialized nations.

Since its founding by the United Nations in 1957, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has promoted two, sometimes contradictory, missions: on the one hand, the Agency seeks to promote and spread internationally the use of civilian nuclear energy; on the other hand, it seeks to prevent, or at least detect, the diversion of civilian nuclear energy to nuclear weapons, nuclear explosive devices or purposes unknown. The IAEA now operates a safeguards system as specified under Article III of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968, which aims to ensure that civil stocks of uranium and plutonium, as well as facilities and technologies associated with these nuclear materials, are used only for peaceful purposes and do not contribute in any way to proliferation or nuclear weapons programs. It is often argued that the proliferation of nuclear weapons to many other states has been prevented by the extension of assurances and mutual defence treaties to these states by nuclear powers, but other factors, such as national prestige, or specific historical experiences, also play a part in hastening or stopping nuclear proliferation.

==Dual-Use Technology==
Dual-use technology refers to the possibility of military use of civilian nuclear power technology. Many technologies and materials associated with the creation of a nuclear power program have a dual-use capability, in that several stages of the nuclear fuel cycle allow diversion of nuclear materials for nuclear weapons. When this happens a nuclear power program can become a route leading to the atomic bomb or a public annex to a secret bomb program. The crisis over Iran&#x27;s nuclear activities is a case in point.

Many UN and US agencies warn that building more nuclear reactors unavoidably increases nuclear proliferation risks. A fundamental goal for American and global security is to minimize the proliferation risks associated with the
expansion of nuclear power. If this development is &quot;poorly managed or efforts to contain risks are unsuccessful, the nuclear future will be dangerous&quot;. For nuclear power programs to be developed and managed safely and securely, it is important that countries have domestic “good governance” characteristics that will encourage proper nuclear operations and management:

These characteristics include low degrees of corruption (to avoid officials selling materials and technology for their own personal gain as occurred with the A.Q. Khan smuggling network in Pakistan), high degrees of political stability (defined by the World Bank as &quot;likelihood that the government will be destabilized or overthrown by unconstitutional or violent means, including motivated violence and terrorism&quot;), high governmental effectiveness scores (a World Bank aggregate measure of &quot;the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures [and] the quality of policy formulation and implementation&quot;), and a strong degree of regulatory competence.
==International Cooperation==

===Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons===
At present, 189 countries are States Parties to the &quot;Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons&quot;, more commonly known as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or NPT. These include the five Nuclear Weapons States (NWS) recognized by the NPT: the People&#x27;s Republic of China, France, Russian Federation, the UK, and the United States.

Notable non-signatories to the NPT are Israel, Pakistan, and India (the latter two have since tested nuclear weapons, while Israel is considered by most to be an unacknowledged nuclear weapons state). North Korea was once a signatory but withdrew in January 2003. The legality of North Korea&#x27;s withdrawal is debatable but as of 9 October 2006, North Korea clearly possesses the capability to make a nuclear explosive device.

===International Atomic Energy Agency===
The IAEA was established on 29 July 1957 to help nations develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Allied to this role is the administration of safeguards arrangements to provide assurance to the international community that individual countries are honoring their commitments under the treaty. Though established under its own international treaty, the IAEA reports to both the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council.

The IAEA regularly inspects civil nuclear facilities to verify the accuracy of documentation supplied to it. The agency checks inventories, and samples and analyzes materials. Safeguards are designed to deter a diversion of nuclear material by increasing the risk of early detection. They are complemented by controls on the export of sensitive technology from countries such as the UK and the United States through voluntary bodies such as the Nuclear Suppliers Group. The main concern of the IAEA is that uranium not be enriched beyond what is necessary for commercial civil plants, and that plutonium which is produced by nuclear reactors not be refined into a form that would be suitable for bomb production.

===Scope of safeguards===

Traditional safeguards are arrangements to account for and control the use of nuclear materials. This verification is a key element in the international system which ensures that uranium in particular is used only for peaceful purposes.

Parties to the NPT agree to accept technical safeguard measures applied by the IAEA. These require that operators of nuclear facilities maintain and declare detailed accounting records of all movements and transactions involving nuclear material. Over 550 facilities and several hundred other locations are subject to regular inspection, and their records and the nuclear material being audited. Inspections by the IAEA are complemented by other measures such as surveillance cameras and instrumentation.

The inspections act as an alert system providing a warning of the possible diversion of nuclear material from peaceful activities. The system relies on;

# Material Accountancy – tracking all inward and outward transfers and the flow of materials in any nuclear facility. This includes sampling and analysis of nuclear material, on-site inspections, and review and verification of operating records.
# Physical Security – restricting access to nuclear materials at the site.
# Containment and Surveillance – use of seals, automatic cameras and other instruments to detect unreported movement or tampering with nuclear materials, as well as spot checks on-site.
All NPT non-weapons states must accept these full-scope safeguards. In the five weapons states plus the non-NPT states (India, Pakistan and Israel), facility-specific safeguards apply. IAEA inspectors regularly visit these facilities to verify completeness and accuracy of records.

The terms of the NPT cannot be enforced by the IAEA itself, nor can nations be forced to sign the treaty. In reality, as shown in Iraq and North Korea, safeguards can be backed up by diplomatic, political and economic measures.

While traditional safeguards easily verified the correctness of formal declarations by suspect states, in the 1990s attention turned to what might not have been declared. While accepting safeguards at declared facilities, Iraq had set up elaborate equipment elsewhere in an attempt to enrich uranium to weapons-grade. North Korea attempted to use research reactors (not commercial electricity-generating reactors) and a nuclear reprocessing plant to produce some weapons-grade plutonium.

The weakness of the NPT regime lay in the fact that no obvious diversion of material was involved. The uranium used as fuel probably came from indigenous sources, and the nuclear facilities were built by the countries themselves without being declared or placed under safeguards. Iraq, as an NPT party, was obliged to declare all facilities but did not do so. Nevertheless, the activities were detected and brought under control using international diplomacy. In Iraq, a military defeat assisted this process.

In North Korea, the activities concerned took place before the conclusion of its NPT safeguards agreement. With North Korea, the promised provision of commercial power reactors appeared to resolve the situation for a time, but it later withdrew from the NPT and declared it had nuclear weapons.

===Additional Protocol===
In 1993 a program was initiated to strengthen and extend the classical safeguards system, and a model protocol was agreed by the IAEA Board of Governors 1997. The measures boosted the IAEA&#x27;s ability to detect undeclared nuclear activities, including those with no connection to the civil fuel cycle.

Innovations were of two kinds. Some could be implemented on the basis of IAEA&#x27;s existing legal authority through safeguards agreements and inspections. Others required further legal authority to be conferred through an Additional Protocol. This must be agreed by each non-weapons state with IAEA, as a supplement to any existing comprehensive safeguards agreement. Weapons states have agreed to accept the principles of the model additional protocol.

Key elements of the model Additional Protocol:
* The IAEA is to be given considerably more information on nuclear and nuclear-related activities, including R &amp; D, production of uranium and thorium (regardless of whether it is traded), and nuclear-related imports and exports.
* IAEA inspectors will have greater rights of access. This will include any suspect location, it can be at short notice (e.g., two hours), and the IAEA can deploy environmental sampling and remote monitoring techniques to detect illicit activities.
* States must streamline administrative procedures so that IAEA inspectors get automatic visa renewal and can communicate more readily with IAEA headquarters.
* Further evolution of safeguards is towards evaluation of each state, taking account of its particular situation and the kind of nuclear materials it has. This will involve greater judgement on the part of IAEA and the development of effective methodologies which reassure NPT States.

As of 3 July 2015, 146 countries have signed the Additional Protocols and 126 have brought them into force. The IAEA is also applying the measures of the Additional Protocol in Taiwan. Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Iran has agreed to implement its protocol provisionally. Among the leading countries that have not signed the Additional Protocol are Egypt, which says it will not sign until Israel accepts comprehensive IAEA safeguards, and Brazil, which opposes making the protocol a requirement for international cooperation on enrichment and reprocessing, but has not ruled out signing.

===Limitations of safeguards===

The greatest risk from nuclear weapons proliferation comes from countries that have not joined the NPT and which have significant unsafeguarded nuclear activities; India, Pakistan, and Israel fall within this category. While safeguards apply to some of their activities, others remain beyond scrutiny.

A further concern is that countries may develop various sensitive nuclear fuel cycle facilities and research reactors under full safeguards and then subsequently opt out of the NPT. Bilateral agreements, such as insisted upon by Australia and Canada for sale of uranium, address this by including fallback provisions, but many countries are outside the scope of these agreements. If a nuclear-capable country does leave the NPT, it is likely to be reported by the IAEA to the United Nations Security Council, just as if it were in breach of its safeguards agreement. Trade sanctions would then be likely.

IAEA safeguards can help ensure that uranium supplied as nuclear fuel and other nuclear supplies do not contribute to nuclear weapons proliferation. In fact, the worldwide application of those safeguards and the substantial world trade in uranium for nuclear electricity make the proliferation of nuclear weapons much less likely.

The Additional Protocol, once it is widely in force, will provide credible assurance that there are no undeclared nuclear materials or activities in the states concerned. This will be a major step forward in preventing nuclear proliferation.

===Other developments===
The Nuclear Suppliers Group communicated its guidelines, essentially a set of export rules, to the IAEA in 1978. These were to ensure that transfers of nuclear material or equipment would not be diverted to unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle or nuclear explosive activities, and formal government assurances to this effect were required from recipients. The Guidelines also recognised the need for physical protection measures in the transfer of sensitive facilities, technology and weapons-usable materials, and strengthened retransfer provisions. The group began with seven members—the United States, the former USSR, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Canada and Japan—but now includes 46 countries including all five nuclear weapons states.

The International Framework for Nuclear Energy Cooperation is an international project involving 25 partner countries, 28 observer and candidate partner countries, and the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Generation IV International Forum, and the European Commission. Its goal is to &quot;[..] provide competitive, commercially-based services as an alternative to a state’s development of costly, proliferation-sensitive facilities, and address other issues associated with the safe and secure management of used fuel and radioactive waste.&quot;

According to Kenneth D. Bergeron&#x27;s &quot;Tritium on Ice: The Dangerous New Alliance of Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear Power&quot;, tritium is not classified as a &quot;special nuclear material&quot; but rather as a by-product. It is seen as an important litmus test on the seriousness of the United States&#x27; intention to nuclear disarm. This radioactive, super-heavy, hydrogen isotope is used to boost the efficiency of fissile materials in nuclear weapons. The United States resumed tritium production in 2003 for the first time in 15 years. This could indicate that there is a potential nuclear arms stockpile replacement since the isotope naturally decays.

In May 1995, NPT parties reaffirmed their commitment to a Fissile Materials Cut-off Treaty to prohibit the production of any further fissile material for weapons. This aims to complement the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty of 1996 (not entered into force as of June 2020) and to codify commitments made by the United States, the UK, France and Russia to cease production of weapons material, as well as putting a similar ban on China. This treaty will also put more pressure on Israel, India and Pakistan to agree to international verification.

On 9 August 2005, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a fatwa forbidding the production, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons. Khamenei&#x27;s official statement was made at the meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna. As of February 2006 Iran formally announced that uranium enrichment within their borders has continued. Iran claims it is for peaceful purposes but the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the United States claim the purpose is for nuclear weapon research and construction.

==Unsanctioned Nuclear Activity or U.N.A==
===NPT Non Signatories===
India, Pakistan and Israel have been &quot;threshold&quot; countries in terms of the international non-proliferation regime. They possess or are quickly capable of assembling one or more nuclear weapons. They have remained outside the 1970 NPT. They are thus largely excluded from trade in nuclear plants or materials, except for safety-related devices for a few safeguarded facilities.

In May 1998 India and Pakistan each exploded several nuclear devices underground. This heightened concerns regarding a nuclear arms race between them, with Pakistan involving the People&#x27;s Republic of China, an acknowledged nuclear weapons state. Both countries are opposed to the NPT as it stands, and India has consistently attacked the Treaty since its inception in 1970 labeling it as a lopsided treaty in favor of the nuclear powers.

Relations between the two countries are tense and hostile, and the risks of nuclear conflict between them have long been considered quite high. Kashmir is a prime cause of bilateral tension, its sovereignty being in dispute since 1948. There is a persistent low-level bilateral military conflict due to the alleged backing of insurgency by Pakistan in India, and the infiltration of Pakistani state-backed militants into the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, along with the disputed status of Kashmir.

Both engaged in a conventional arms race in the 1980s, including sophisticated technology and equipment capable of delivering nuclear weapons. In the 1990s the arms race quickened. In 1994 India reversed a four-year trend of reduced allocations for defence, and despite its much smaller economy, Pakistan was expected to push its own expenditures yet higher. Both have lost their patrons: India, the former USSR, and Pakistan, the United States.

But it is the growth and modernization of China&#x27;s nuclear arsenal and its assistance with Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear power programme and, reportedly, with missile technology, which exacerbate Indian concerns. In particular, as viewed by Indian strategists, Pakistan is aided by China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

====India====
Nuclear power for civil use is well established in India. Its civil nuclear strategy has been directed towards complete independence in the nuclear fuel cycle, necessary because of its outspoken rejection of the NPT. Due to economic and technological isolation of India after the nuclear tests in 1974, India has largely diverted focus on developing and perfecting the fast breeder technology by intensive materials and fuel cycle research at the dedicated center established for research into fast reactor technology, Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Research (IGCAR) at Kalpakkam, in the southern part of the country. At the moment, India has a small fast breeder reactor and is planning a much larger one (Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor). This self-sufficiency extends from uranium exploration and mining through fuel fabrication, heavy water production, reactor design and construction, to reprocessing and waste management. It is also developing technology to utilise its abundant resources of thorium as a nuclear fuel.

India has 14 small nuclear power reactors in commercial operation, two larger ones under construction, and ten more planned. The 14 operating ones (2548 MWe total) comprise:
* two 150 MWe BWRs from the United States, which started up in 1969, now use locally enriched uranium and are under safeguards,
* two small Canadian PHWRs (1972 &amp; 1980), also under safeguards, and
* ten local PHWRs based on Canadian designs, two of 150 and eight 200 MWe.
* two new 540 MWe and two 700 MWe plants at Tarapur (known as TAPP: Tarapur Atomic Power Station)

The two under construction and two of the planned ones are 450 MWe versions of these 200 MWe domestic products. Construction has been seriously delayed by financial and technical problems. In 2001 a final agreement was signed with Russia for the country&#x27;s first large nuclear power plant, comprising two VVER-1000 reactors, under a Russian-financed US$3 billion contract. The first unit is due to be commissioned in 2007. A further two Russian units are under consideration for the site. Nuclear power supplied 3.1% of India&#x27;s electricity in 2000.

Its weapons material appears to come from a Canadian-designed 40 MW &quot;research&quot; reactor which started up in 1960, well before the NPT, and a 100 MW indigenous unit in operation since 1985. Both use local uranium, as India does not import any nuclear fuel. It is estimated that India may have built up enough weapons-grade plutonium for a hundred nuclear warheads.

It is widely believed that the nuclear programs of India and Pakistan used Canadian CANDU reactors to produce fissionable materials for their weapons; however, this is not accurate. Both Canada (by supplying the 40 MW research reactor) and the United States (by supplying 21 tons of heavy water) supplied India with the technology necessary to create a nuclear weapons program, dubbed CIRUS (Canada-India Reactor, United States). Canada sold India the reactor on the condition that the reactor and any by-products would be &quot;employed for peaceful purposes only.&quot; . Similarly, the United States sold India heavy water for use in the reactor &quot;only... in connection with research into and the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes&quot; . India, in violation of these agreements, used the Canadian-supplied reactor and American-supplied heavy water to produce plutonium for their first nuclear explosion, Smiling Buddha. The Indian government controversially justified this, however, by claiming that Smiling Buddha was a &quot;peaceful nuclear explosion.&quot;

The country has at least three other research reactors including the tiny one which is exploring the use of thorium as a nuclear fuel, by breeding fissile U-233. In addition, an advanced heavy-water thorium cycle is under development.

India exploded a nuclear device in 1974, the so-called Smiling Buddha test, which it has consistently claimed was for peaceful purposes. Others saw it as a response to China&#x27;s nuclear weapons capability. It was then universally perceived, notwithstanding official denials, to possess, or to be able to quickly assemble, nuclear weapons. In 1999 it deployed its own medium-range missile and has developed an intermediate-range missile capable of reaching targets in China&#x27;s industrial heartland.

In 1995 the United States quietly intervened to head off a proposed nuclear test. However, in 1998 there were five more tests in Operation Shakti. These were unambiguously military, including one claimed to be of a sophisticated thermonuclear device, and their declared purpose was &quot;to help in the design of nuclear weapons of different yields and different delivery systems&quot;.

Indian security policies are driven by:
* its determination to be recognized as a dominant power in the region
* its increasing concern with China&#x27;s expanding nuclear weapons and missile delivery programmes
* its concern with Pakistan&#x27;s capability to deliver nuclear weapons deep into India

It perceives nuclear weapons as a cost-effective political counter to China&#x27;s nuclear and conventional weaponry, and the effects of its nuclear weapons policy in provoking Pakistan is, by some accounts, considered incidental.
India has had an unhappy relationship with China. After an uneasy ceasefire ended the 1962 war, relations between the two nations were frozen until 1998. Since then a degree of high-level contact has been established and a few elementary confidence-building measures put in place. China still occupies some territory which it captured during the aforementioned war, claimed by India, and India still occupies some territory claimed by China. Its nuclear weapon and missile support for Pakistan is a major bone of contention.

American President George W. Bush met with India Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to discuss India&#x27;s involvement with nuclear weapons. The two countries agreed that the United States would give nuclear power assistance to India.

====Pakistan====


Over the years in Pakistan, nuclear power infrastructure has been well established. It is dedicated to the industrial and economic development of the country. Its current nuclear policy is aimed to promote the socio-economic development of its people as a &quot;foremost priority&quot;; and to fulfill energy, economic, and industrial needs from nuclear sources. , there were three operational mega-commercial nuclear power plants while three larger ones were under construction. The nuclear power plants supplied 787 megawatts (MW) (roughly ≈3.6%) of electricity, and the country has projected production of 8800 MW by 2030. Infrastructure established by the IAEA and the U.S. in the 1950s–1960s was based on peaceful research and development and the economic prosperity of the country.

Although the civil-sector nuclear power was established in the 1950s, the country has an active nuclear weapons program which was started in the 1970s. The bomb program has its roots after East Pakistan gained its independence through the Bangladesh Liberation War, as the new nation of Bangladesh, after India&#x27;s successful intervention led to a decisive victory over Pakistan in 1971. This large-scale but clandestine atomic bomb project was directed towards the indigenous development of reactor and military-grade plutonium. In 1974, when India surprised the world with the successful detonation of its own bomb, codename &quot;Smiling Buddha&quot;, it became &quot;imperative for Pakistan&quot; to pursue weapons research. According to a leading scientist in the program, it became clear that once India detonated their bomb, &quot;Newton&#x27;s Third Law&quot; came into &quot;operation&quot;, from then on it was a classic case of &quot;action and reaction&quot;. Earlier efforts were directed towards mastering the plutonium technology from France, but that route was slowed when the plan failed after U.S. intervention to cancel the project. Contrary to popular perception, Pakistan did not forego the &quot;plutonium&quot; route and covertly continued its indigenous research under Munir Ahmad Khan and it succeeded with that route in the early 1980s. Reacting to India&#x27;s first nuclear weapon test, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the country&#x27;s political and military science circles sensed this test as final and dangerous anticipation to Pakistan&#x27;s &quot;moral and physical existence.&quot; With diplomat Aziz Ahmed on his side, Prime Minister Bhutto launched a serious diplomatic offense and aggressively maintained at the session of the United Nations Security Council:

After 1974, Bhutto&#x27;s government redoubled its effort, this time equally focused on uranium and plutonium. Pakistan had established science directorates in almost all of her embassies in the important countries of the world, with theoretical physicist S.A. Butt being the director. Abdul Qadeer Khan then established a network through Dubai to smuggle URENCO technology to the Engineering Research Laboratories. Earlier, he worked with the &quot;Physics Dynamics Research Laboratories&quot; (FDO), a subsidiary of the Dutch firm VMF-Stork based in Amsterdam. Later after joining, Urenco, he had access through photographs and documents to the technology. Against popular perception, the technology that Khan had brought from Urenco was based on first generation civil reactor technology, filled with many serious technical errors, though it was an authentic and vital link for the country&#x27;s gas centrifuge project. After the British Government stopped the British subsidiary of the American Emerson Electric Co. from shipping components to Pakistan, he describes his frustration with a supplier from Germany as: &quot;That man from the German team was unethical. When he did not get the order from us, he wrote a letter to a Labour Party member and questions were asked in [British] Parliament.&quot; By 1978, his efforts paid off and made him into a national hero.

In early 1996 the next Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto made it clear that &quot;if India conducts a nuclear test, Pakistan could be forced to &quot;follow suit&quot;. In 1997, her statement was echoed by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif who maintained that &quot;since 1972, [P]akistan had progressed significantly, and we have left that stage (developmental) far behind. Pakistan will not be made a &quot;hostage&quot; to India by signing the CTBT, before (India).!&quot; In May 1998, within weeks of India&#x27;s nuclear tests, Pakistan announced that it had conducted six underground tests in the Chagai Hills, five on 28 May and one on 30 May. Seismic events consistent with these claims were recorded.

In 2004, the revelation of Khan&#x27;s efforts led to the exposure of many defunct European consortiums which had defied export restrictions in the 1970s, and of many defunct Dutch companies that exported thousands of centrifuges to Pakistan as early as 1976. Many centrifuge components were apparently manufactured by the Malaysian Scomi Precision Engineering with the assistance of South Asian and German companies, and used a UAE-based computer company as a false front.

It was widely believed to have had direct involvement by the Government of Pakistan. This claim could not be verified due to the refusal of that Government to allow the IAEA to interview the alleged head of the nuclear black market, who happened to be no other than Abdul Qadeer Khan. Confessing his crimes a month later on national television, Khan bailed out the Government by taking full responsibility. Independent investigation conducted by International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) confirmed that he had control over the import-export deals, and his acquisition activities were largely unsupervised by Pakistan governmental authorities. All of his activities went undetected for several years. He duly confessed to running the atomic proliferation ring from Pakistan to Iran and North Korea. He was immediately given presidential immunity. The exact nature of involvement at the governmental level is still unclear, but the manner in which the government acted cast doubt on the sincerity of Pakistan. However, the contents of Abdul Qadeer Khan&#x27;s personal diaries present his perspective on the matters related to his activities concerning nuclear secrets. He claimed that he acted only at the order or &quot;instigation&quot; of the Pakistan government. Even when there was no official authorization, Pakistani military knew of Khan&#x27;s activity according to the contents of the diaries. On one occasion in 1980, a colonel knew of Khan being in touch with Syria&#x27;s Defense Minister Gen. Mustafa Tlass and Gen. Hikmat Shihabi. Six months later, Khan was warned by Zia Ul Haq to be careful over &quot;nuclear drawings&quot;.

====North Korea====
The Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (or better known as North Korea), joined the NPT in 1985 and had subsequently signed a safeguards agreement with the IAEA. However, it was believed that North Korea was diverting plutonium extracted from the fuel of its reactor at Yongbyon, for use in nuclear weapons. The subsequent confrontation with IAEA on the issue of inspections and suspected violations, resulted in North Korea threatening to withdraw from the NPT in 1993. This eventually led to negotiations with the United States resulting in the Agreed Framework of 1994, which provided for IAEA safeguards being applied to its reactors and spent fuel rods. These spent fuel rods were sealed in canisters by the United States to prevent North Korea from extracting plutonium from them. North Korea had to therefore freeze its plutonium programme.

During this period, Pakistan-North Korea cooperation in missile technology transfer was being established. A high-level delegation of Pakistan military visited North Korea in August–September 1992, reportedly to discuss the supply of missile technology to Pakistan. In 1993, PM Benazir Bhutto repeatedly traveled to China, and the paid state visit to North Korea. The visits are believed to be related to the subsequent acquisition technology to developed its Ghauri system by Pakistan. During the period 1992–1994, A.Q. Khan was reported to have visited North Korea thirteen times. The missile cooperation program with North Korea was under Dr. A. Q. Khan Research Laboratories. At this time China was under U.S. pressure not to supply the M Dongfeng series of missiles to Pakistan. It is believed by experts that possibly with Chinese connivance and facilitation, the latter was forced to approach North Korea for missile transfers. Reports indicate that North Korea was willing to supply missile sub-systems including rocket motors, inertial guidance systems, control and testing equipment for US$50 million.

It is not clear what North Korea got in return. Joseph S. Bermudez Jr. in &quot;Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly&quot; (27 November 2002) reports that Western analysts had begun to question what North Korea received in payment for the missiles; many suspected it was the nuclear technology. The KRL was in charge of both the uranium program and also of the missile program with North Korea. It is therefore likely during this period that cooperation in nuclear technology between Pakistan and North Korea was initiated. Western intelligence agencies began to notice the exchange of personnel, technology and components between KRL and entities of the North Korean 2nd Economic Committee (responsible for weapons production).

A &quot;New York Times&quot; report on 18 October 2002 quoted U.S. intelligence officials having stated that Pakistan was a major supplier of critical equipment to North Korea. The report added that equipment such as gas centrifuges appeared to have been &quot;part of a barter deal&quot; in which North Korea supplied Pakistan with missiles. Separate reports indicate (&quot;The Washington Times&quot;, 22 November 2002) that U.S. intelligence had as early as 1999 picked up signs that North Korea was continuing to develop nuclear arms. Other reports also indicate that North Korea had been working covertly to develop an enrichment capability for nuclear weapons for at least five years and had used technology obtained from Pakistan (&quot;The Washington Times&quot;, 18 October 2002).

====Israel====
Israel is also thought to possess an arsenal of potentially up to several hundred nuclear warheads based on estimates of the amount of fissile material produced by Israel. This has never been openly confirmed or denied however, due to Israel&#x27;s policy of deliberate ambiguity.

An Israeli nuclear installation is located about ten kilometers to the south of Dimona, the Negev Nuclear Research Center. Its construction commenced in 1958, with French assistance. The official reason given by the Israeli and French governments was to build a nuclear reactor to power a &quot;desalination plant&quot;, in order to &quot;green the Negev&quot;. The purpose of the Dimona plant is widely assumed to be the manufacturing of nuclear weapons, and the majority of defense experts have concluded that it does in fact do that. However, the Israeli government refuses to confirm or deny this publicly, a policy it refers to as &quot;ambiguity&quot;.

Norway sold 20 tonnes of heavy water needed for the reactor to Israel in 1959 and 1960 in a secret deal. There were no &quot;safeguards&quot; required in this deal to prevent the use of heavy water for non-peaceful purposes. The British newspaper &quot;Daily Express&quot; accused Israel of working on a bomb in 1960.
When the United States intelligence community discovered the purpose of the Dimona plant in the early 1960s, it demanded that Israel agree to international inspections. Israel agreed, but on a condition that the U.S., rather than IAEA, inspectors were used, and that Israel would receive advanced notice of all inspections.
Some claim that because Israel knew the schedule of the inspectors&#x27; visits, it was able to hide the alleged purpose of the site from the inspectors by installing temporary false walls and other devices before each inspection. The inspectors eventually informed the U.S. government that their inspections were useless due to Israeli restrictions on what areas of the facility they could inspect. In 1969, the United States terminated the inspections.

In 1986, Mordechai Vanunu, a former technician at the Dimona plant, revealed to the media some evidence of Israel&#x27;s nuclear program. Israeli Mossad agents arrested him in Italy, drugged him and transported him to Israel. An Israeli court then tried him in secret on charges of treason and espionage, and sentenced him to eighteen years imprisonment. He was freed on 21 April 2004, but was severely limited by the Israeli government. He was arrested again on 11 November 2004, though formal charges were not immediately filed.

Comments on photographs taken by Vanunu inside the Negev Nuclear Research Center have been made by prominent scientists. British nuclear weapons scientist Frank Barnaby, who questioned Vanunu over several days, estimated Israel had enough plutonium for about 150 weapons.

According to Lieutenant Colonel Warner D. Farr in a report to the USAF Counterproliferation Center, while France was previously a leader in nuclear research &quot;Israel and France were at a similar level of expertise after WWII, and Israeli scientists could make significant contributions to the French effort.&quot; In 1986 Francis Perrin, French high-commissioner for atomic energy from 1951 to 1970 stated that in 1949 Israeli scientists were invited to the Saclay nuclear research facility, this cooperation leading to a joint effort including sharing of knowledge between French and Israeli scientists especially those with knowledge from the Manhattan Project.

===Nuclear arms control in South Asia===

The public stance of India and Pakistan on non-proliferation differs markedly. Pakistan has initiated a series of regional security proposals. It has repeatedly proposed a nuclear-free zone in South Asia, and has proclaimed its willingness to engage in nuclear disarmament and to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty if India would do so. It has endorsed a United States proposal for a regional five power conference to consider non-proliferation in South Asia.

India has taken the view that solutions to regional security issues should be found at the international rather than the regional level, since its chief concern is with China. It therefore rejects Pakistan&#x27;s proposals.

Instead, the &#x27;Gandhi Plan&#x27;, put forward in 1988, proposed the revision of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which it regards as inherently discriminatory in favor of the nuclear-weapon States, and a timetable for complete nuclear weapons disarmament. It endorsed early proposals for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and for an international convention to ban the production of highly enriched uranium and plutonium for weapons purposes, known as the &#x27;cut-off&#x27; convention.

The United States for some years, especially under the Clinton administration, pursued a variety of initiatives to persuade India and Pakistan to abandon their nuclear weapons programs and to accept comprehensive international safeguards on all their nuclear activities. To this end, the Clinton administration proposed a conference of the five nuclear-weapon states, Japan, Germany, India and Pakistan.

India refused this and similar previous proposals, and countered with demands that other potential weapons states, such as Iran and North Korea, should be invited, and that regional limitations would only be acceptable if they were accepted equally by China. The United States would not accept the participation of Iran and North Korea and these initiatives have lapsed.

Another, more recent approach, centers on &#x27;capping&#x27; the production of fissile material for weapons purposes, which would hopefully be followed by &#x27;roll back&#x27;. To this end, India and the United States jointly sponsored a UN General Assembly resolution in 1993 calling for negotiations for a &#x27;cut-off&#x27; convention. Should India and Pakistan join such a convention, they would have to agree to halt the production of fissile materials for weapons and to accept international verification on their relevant nuclear facilities (enrichment and reprocessing plants). It appears that India is now prepared to join negotiations regarding such a Cut-off Treaty, under the UN Conference on Disarmament.

Bilateral confidence-building measures between India and Pakistan to reduce the prospects of confrontation have been limited. In 1990 each side ratified a treaty not to attack the other&#x27;s nuclear installations, and at the end of 1991 they provided one another with a list showing the location of all their nuclear plants, even though the respective lists were regarded as not being wholly accurate. Early in 1994 India proposed a bilateral agreement for a &#x27;no first use&#x27; of nuclear weapons and an extension of the &#x27;no attack&#x27; treaty to cover civilian and industrial targets as well as nuclear installations.

Having promoted the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty since 1954, India dropped its support in 1995 and in 1996 attempted to block the Treaty. Following the 1998 tests the question has been reopened and both Pakistan and India have indicated their intention to sign the CTBT. Indian ratification may be conditional upon the five weapons states agreeing to specific reductions in nuclear arsenals. The UN Conference on Disarmament has also called upon both countries &quot;to accede without delay to the Non-Proliferation Treaty&quot;, presumably as non-weapons states.

===NPT signatories===

====Egypt====

In 2004 and 2005, Egypt disclosed past undeclared nuclear activities and material to the IAEA. In 2007 and 2008, high-enriched and low-enriched uranium particles were found in environmental samples taken in Egypt. In 2008, the IAEA states Egypt&#x27;s statements were consistent with its own findings. In May 2009, &quot;Reuters&quot; reported that the IAEA was conducting further investigation in Egypt.

====Iran====
In 2003, the IAEA reported that Iran had been in breach of its obligations to comply with provisions of its safeguard agreement. In 2005, the IAEA Board of Governors voted in a rare non-consensus decision to find Iran in non-compliance with its NPT Safeguards Agreement and to report that non-compliance to the UN Security Council. In response, the UN Security Council passed a series of resolutions citing concerns about the program. Iran&#x27;s representative to the UN argues sanctions compel Iran to abandon its rights under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to peaceful nuclear technology. Iran says its uranium enrichment program is exclusively for peaceful purposes and has enriched uranium to &quot;less than 5 percent,&quot; consistent with fuel for a nuclear power plant and significantly below the purity of WEU (around 90%) typically used in a weapons program. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Yukiya Amano, said in 2009 he had not seen any evidence in IAEA official documents that Iran was developing nuclear weapons.

====Iraq====
Up to the late 1980s it was generally assumed that any undeclared nuclear activities would have to be based on the diversion of nuclear material from safeguards. States acknowledged the possibility of nuclear activities entirely separate from those covered by safeguards, but it was assumed they would be detected by national intelligence activities. There was no particular effort by IAEA to attempt to detect them.

Iraq had been making efforts to secure a nuclear potential since the 1960s. In the late 1970s a specialised plant, Osiraq, was constructed near Baghdad. The plant was attacked during the Iran–Iraq War and was destroyed by Israeli bombers in June 1981.

Not until the 1990 NPT Review Conference did some states raise the possibility of making more use of (for example) provisions for &quot;special inspections&quot; in existing NPT Safeguards Agreements. Special inspections can be undertaken at locations other than those where safeguards routinely apply, if there is reason to believe there may be undeclared material or activities.

After inspections in Iraq following the UN Gulf War cease-fire resolution showed the extent of Iraq&#x27;s clandestine nuclear weapons program, it became clear that the IAEA would have to broaden the scope of its activities. Iraq was an NPT Party, and had thus agreed to place all its nuclear material under IAEA safeguards. But the inspections revealed that it had been pursuing an extensive clandestine uranium enrichment programme, as well as a nuclear weapons design programme.

The main thrust of Iraq&#x27;s uranium enrichment program was the development of technology for electromagnetic isotope separation (EMIS) of indigenous uranium. This uses the same principles as a mass spectrometer (albeit on a much larger scale). Ions of uranium-238 and uranium-235 are separated because they describe arcs of different radii when they move through a magnetic field. This process was used in the Manhattan Project to make the highly enriched uranium used in the Hiroshima bomb, but was abandoned soon afterwards.

The Iraqis did the basic research work at their nuclear research establishment at Tuwaitha, near Baghdad, and were building two full-scale facilities at Tarmiya and Ash Sharqat, north of Baghdad. However, when the war broke out, only a few separators had been installed at Tarmiya, and none at Ash Sharqat.

The Iraqis were also very interested in centrifuge enrichment, and had been able to acquire some components including some carbon-fibre rotors, which they were at an early stage of testing. In May 1998, &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that Abdul Qadeer Khan had sent Iraq centrifuge designs, which were apparently confiscated by the UNMOVIC officials. Iraqi officials said &quot;the documents were authentic but that they had not agreed to work with A. Q. Khan, fearing an ISI sting operation, due to strained relations between two countries. The Government of Pakistan and A. Q. Khan strongly denied this allegation whilst the government declared the evidence to be &quot;fraudulent&quot;.

They were clearly in violation of their NPT and safeguards obligations, and the IAEA Board of Governors ruled to that effect. The UN Security Council then ordered the IAEA to remove, destroy or render harmless Iraq&#x27;s nuclear weapons capability. This was done by mid-1998, but Iraq then ceased all cooperation with the UN, so the IAEA withdrew from this work.

The revelations from Iraq provided the impetus for a very far-reaching reconsideration of what safeguards are intended to achieve.

====Libya====

Libya possesses ballistic missiles and previously pursued nuclear weapons under the leadership of Muammar Gaddafi. On 19 December 2003, Gaddafi announced that Libya would voluntarily eliminate all materials, equipment and programs that could lead to internationally proscribed weapons, including weapons of mass destruction and long-range ballistic missiles. Libya signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1968 and ratified it in 1975, and concluded a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 1980. In March 2004, the IAEA Board of Governors welcomed Libya&#x27;s decision to eliminate its formerly undeclared nuclear program, which it found had violated Libya&#x27;s safeguards agreement, and approved Libya&#x27;s Additional Protocol. The United States and the United Kingdom assisted Libya in removing equipment and material from its nuclear weapons program, with independent verification by the IAEA.

====Myanmar====

A report in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and &quot;Searchina&quot;, a Japanese newspaper, report that two Myanma defectors saying that the State Peace and Development Council junta was secretly building a nuclear reactor and plutonium extraction facility with North Korea&#x27;s help, with the aim of acquiring its first nuclear bomb in five years. According to the report, &quot;The secret complex, much of it in caves tunnelled into a mountain at Naung Laing in northern Burma, runs parallel to a civilian reactor being built at another site by Russia that both the Russians and Burmese say will be put under international safeguards.&quot; In 2002, Myanmar had notified IAEA of its intention to pursue a civilian nuclear programme. Later, Russia announced that it would build a nuclear reactor in Myanmar. There have also been reports that two Pakistani scientists, from the AQ Khan stable, had been dispatched to Myanmar where they had settled down, to help Myanmar&#x27;s project. Recently, the David Albright-led Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) rang alarm bells about Myanmar attempting a nuclear project with North Korean help. If true, the full weight of international pressure will be brought against Myanmar, said officials familiar with developments. But equally, the information that has been peddled by the defectors is also &quot;preliminary&quot; and could be used by the west to turn the screws on Myanmar—on democracy and human rights issues—in the run-up to the elections in the country in 2010. During an ASEAN meeting in Thailand in July 2009, US secretary of state Hillary Clinton highlighted concerns of the North Korean link. &quot;We know there are also growing concerns about military cooperation between North Korea and Burma which we take very seriously,&quot; Clinton said. However, in 2012, after contact with the American president, Barack Obama, the Burmese leader, Thein Sein, renounced military ties with DPRK (North Korea).

====North Korea====

The Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) acceded to the NPT in 1985 as a condition for the supply of a nuclear power station by the USSR. However, it delayed concluding its NPT Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA, a process which should take only 18 months, until April 1992.

During that period, it brought into operation a small gas-cooled, graphite-moderated, natural-uranium (metal) fuelled &quot;Experimental Power Reactor&quot; of about 25 MWt (5 MWe), based on the UK Magnox design. While this was a well-suited design to start a wholly indigenous nuclear reactor development, it also exhibited all the features of a small plutonium production reactor for weapons purposes. North Korea also made substantial progress in the construction of two larger reactors designed on the same principles, a prototype of about 200 MWt (50 MWe), and a full-scale version of about 800 MWt (200 MWe). They made only slow progress; construction halted on both in 1994 and has not resumed. Both reactors have degraded considerably since that time and would take significant efforts to refurbish.

In addition, it completed and commissioned a reprocessing plant that makes the Magnox spent nuclear fuel safe, recovering uranium and plutonium. That plutonium, if the fuel was only irradiated to a very low burn-up, would have been in a form very suitable for weapons. Although all these facilities at the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center were to be under safeguards, there was always the risk that at some stage, the DPRK would withdraw from the NPT and use the plutonium for weapons.

One of the first steps in applying NPT safeguards is for the IAEA to verify the initial stocks of uranium and plutonium to ensure that all the nuclear materials in the country have been declared for safeguards purposes. While undertaking this work in 1992, IAEA inspectors found discrepancies that indicated that the reprocessing plant had been used more often than the DPRK had declared, which suggested that the DPRK could have weapons-grade plutonium which it had not declared to the IAEA. Information passed to the IAEA by a Member State (as required by the IAEA) supported that suggestion by indicating that the DPRK had two undeclared waste or other storage sites.

In February 1993 the IAEA called on the DPRK to allow special inspections of the two sites so that the initial stocks of nuclear material could be verified. The DPRK refused, and on 12 March announced its intention to withdraw from the NPT (three months&#x27; notice is required). In April 1993 the IAEA Board concluded that the DPRK was in non-compliance with its safeguards obligations and reported the matter to the UN Security Council. In June 1993 the DPRK announced that it had &quot;suspended&quot; its withdrawal from the NPT, but subsequently claimed a &quot;special status&quot; with respect to its safeguards obligations. This was rejected by IAEA.

Once the DPRK&#x27;s non-compliance had been reported to the UN Security Council, the essential part of the IAEA&#x27;s mission had been completed. Inspections in the DPRK continued, although inspectors were increasingly hampered in what they were permitted to do by the DPRK&#x27;s claim of a &quot;special status&quot;. However, some 8,000 corroding fuel rods associated with the experimental reactor have remained under close surveillance.

Following bilateral negotiations between the United States and the DPRK, and the conclusion of the Agreed Framework in October 1994, the IAEA has been given additional responsibilities. The agreement requires a freeze on the operation and construction of the DPRK&#x27;s plutonium production reactors and their related facilities, and the IAEA is responsible for monitoring the freeze until the facilities are eventually dismantled. The DPRK remains uncooperative with the IAEA verification work and has yet to comply with its safeguards agreement.

While Iraq was defeated in a war, allowing the UN the opportunity to seek out and destroy its nuclear weapons programme as part of the cease-fire conditions, the DPRK was not defeated, nor was it vulnerable to other measures, such as trade sanctions. It can scarcely afford to import anything, and sanctions on vital commodities, such as oil, would either be ineffective or risk provoking war.

Ultimately, the DPRK was persuaded to stop what appeared to be its nuclear weapons programme in exchange, under the agreed framework, for about US$5 billion in energy-related assistance. This included two 1000 MWe light-water nuclear power reactors based on an advanced U.S. System-80 design.

In January 2003 the DPRK withdrew from the NPT. In response, a series of discussions among the DPRK, the United States, and China, a series of six-party talks (the parties being the DPRK, the ROK, China, Japan, the United States and Russia) were held in Beijing; the first beginning in April 2004 concerning North Korea&#x27;s weapons program.

On 10 January 2005, North Korea declared that it was in the possession of nuclear weapons. On 19 September 2005, the fourth round of the Six-Party Talks ended with a joint statement in which North Korea agreed to end its nuclear programs and return to the NPT in exchange for diplomatic, energy and economic assistance. However, by the end of 2005 the DPRK had halted all six-party talks because the United States froze certain DPRK international financial assets such as those in a bank in Macau.

On 9 October 2006, North Korea announced that it has performed its first-ever nuclear weapon test. On 18 December 2006, the six-party talks finally resumed. On 13 February 2007, the parties announced &quot;Initial Actions&quot; to implement the 2005 joint statement including shutdown and disablement of North Korean nuclear facilities in exchange for energy assistance. Reacting to UN sanctions imposed after missile tests in April 2009, North Korea withdrew from the six-party talks, restarted its nuclear facilities and conducted a second nuclear test on 25 May 2009.

On 12 February 2013, North Korea conducted an underground nuclear explosion with an estimated yield of 6 to 7 kilotonnes. The detonation registered a magnitude 4.9 disturbance in the area around the epicenter.

====Russia====
Security of nuclear weapons in Russia remains a matter of concern. According to high-ranking Russian SVR defector Tretyakov, he had a meeting with two Russian businessmen representing a state-created &quot;C-W&quot; corporation in 1991. They came up with a project of destroying large quantities of chemical wastes collected from Western countries at the island of Novaya Zemlya (a test place for Soviet nuclear weapons) using an underground nuclear blast. The project was rejected by Canadian representatives, but one of the businessmen told Tretyakov that he keeps his own nuclear bomb at his dacha outside Moscow. Tretyakov thought that man was insane, but the &quot;businessmen&quot; (Vladimir K. Dmitriev) replied: &quot;Do not be so naive. With economic conditions the way they are in Russia today, anyone with enough money can buy a nuclear bomb. It&#x27;s no big deal really&quot;.

====South Africa====

In 1991, South Africa acceded to the NPT, concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the IAEA, and submitted a report on its nuclear material subject to safeguards. At the time, the state had a nuclear power programme producing nearly 10% of the country&#x27;s electricity, whereas Iraq and North Korea only had research reactors.

The IAEA&#x27;s initial verification task was complicated by South Africa&#x27;s announcement that between 1979 and 1989 it built and then dismantled a number of nuclear weapons. South Africa asked the IAEA to verify the conclusion of its weapons programme. In 1995 the IAEA declared that it was satisfied all materials were accounted for and the weapons programme had been terminated and dismantled.

South Africa has signed the NPT, and now holds the distinction of being the only known state to have indigenously produced nuclear weapons, and then verifiably dismantled them.

====Sweden====
After World War II, Sweden considered building nuclear weapons to deter a Soviet invasion. From 1945 to 1972 the Swedish government ran a clandestine nuclear weapons program under the guise of civilian defense research at the Swedish National Defence Research Institute. By the late 1950s, the work had reached the point where underground testing was feasible. However, at that time the Riksdag prohibited research and development of nuclear weapons, pledging that research should be done only for the purpose of defense against nuclear attack. The option to continue development was abandoned in 1966, and Sweden subsequently signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1968. The program was finally concluded in 1972.

====Syria====

On 6 September 2007, Israel bombed an officially unidentified site in Syria which it later asserted was a nuclear reactor under construction (&quot;see Operation Outside the Box&quot;). The alleged reactor was not asserted to be operational and it was not asserted that nuclear material had been introduced into it. Syria said the site was a military site and was not involved in any nuclear activities. The IAEA requested Syria to provide further access to the site and any other locations where the debris and equipment from the building had been stored. Syria denounced what it called the Western &quot;fabrication and forging of facts&quot; in regards to the incident. IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei criticized the strikes and deplored that information regarding the matter had not been shared with his agency earlier.

====Taiwan====

During the Cold War, the United States deployed nuclear weapons at Tainan Air Force Base of Taiwan as part of the United States Taiwan Defense Command. Nonetheless, Taiwan began its own nuclear weapon program under the auspices of the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research (INER) at the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology since 1967. Taiwan was able to acquire nuclear technology from abroad (including a research reactor from Canada and low-grade plutonium from the United States), which were subject to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, but which Taiwan used for its nuclear weapon program. In 1972, US president ordered to remove the nuclear weapons from Taiwan by 1974.

Then recognized as the Republic of China, Taiwan ratified the NPT in 1970. After the IAEA found evidences of Taiwan&#x27;s efforts to produce the weapons-grade plutonium, Taiwan agreed to dismantle its nuclear weapon program under U.S. pressure in September 1976. The nuclear reactor was shut down and the plutonium mostly returned to the U.S. However secret nuclear activities were exposed after the Lieyu massacre by Colonel Chang Hsien-yi, deputy director of INER, who defected to the U.S. in December 1987 and produced a cache of incriminating documents. This program was also halted under the U.S. pressure.

==Breakout capability==

For a state that does not possess nuclear weapons, the capability to produce one or more weapons quickly and with little warning is called a breakout capability.

* , with its civil nuclear infrastructure and experience, has a stockpile of separated plutonium that could be fabricated into weapons relatively quickly.
* , according to some observers, may be seeking (or have already achieved) a breakout capability, with its stockpile of low-enriched uranium and its capability to enrich further to weapons-grade.

==Arguments for and against proliferation==
There has been much debate in the academic study of international security as to the advisability of proliferation. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Gen. Pierre Marie Gallois of France, an adviser to Charles DeGaulle, argued in books like &quot;The Balance of Terror: Strategy for the Nuclear Age&quot; (1961) that mere possession of a nuclear arsenal, what the French called the &quot;Force de frappe&quot;, was enough to ensure deterrence, and thus concluded that the spread of nuclear weapons could increase international stability.

Some very prominent neo-realist scholars, such as Kenneth Waltz, Emeritus Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley and Adjunct Senior Research Scholar at Columbia University, and John Mearsheimer, R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago, continue to argue along the lines of Gallois in a separate development. Specifically, these scholars advocate some forms of nuclear proliferation, arguing that it will decrease the likelihood of war, especially in troubled regions of the world. Aside from the majority opinion which opposes proliferation in any form, there are two schools of thought on the matter: those, like Mearsheimer, who favor selective proliferation, and those such as Waltz, who advocate a laissez-faire attitude to programs like North Korea&#x27;s.

===Total proliferation===
In embryo, Waltz argues that the logic of mutually assured destruction (MAD) should work in all security environments, regardless of historical tensions or recent hostility. He sees the Cold War as the ultimate proof of MAD logic—the only occasion when enmity between two Great Powers did not result in military conflict. This was, he argues, because nuclear weapons promote caution in decision-makers. Neither Washington nor Moscow would risk a nuclear apocalypse to advance territorial or power goals, hence a peaceful stalemate ensued (Waltz and Sagan (2003), p. 24). Waltz believes there to be no reason why this effect would not occur in all circumstances.

Todd Sechser and Matthew Fuhrmann find that nuclear weapons do not necessarily lead states to be more successful in coercive diplomacy. They argue that nuclear weapons are useful for defense, but are not effective offensive tools. As a consequence, they write that nuclear proliferation may &quot;be less harmful for international security than many believe&quot; while cautioning that nuclear proliferation may still be harmful due to miscalculation, terrorism and sabotage.

===Selective proliferation===
John Mearsheimer would not support Waltz&#x27;s optimism in the majority of potential instances; however, he has argued for nuclear proliferation as policy in certain places, such as post–Cold War Europe. In two famous articles, Mearsheimer opined that Europe was bound to return to its pre–Cold War environment of regular conflagration and suspicion at some point in the future. He advocated arming both Germany and Ukraine with nuclear weaponry in order to achieve a balance of power between these states in the east and France/UK in the west and predicted that otherwise war would eventually break out on the European continent Russia did invade Ukraine in 2022.

Another separate argument against Waltz&#x27;s open proliferation and in favor of Mearsheimer&#x27;s selective distribution is the possibility of nuclear terrorism. Some countries included in the aforementioned laissez-faire distribution could predispose the transfer of nuclear materials or a bomb falling into the hands of groups not affiliated with any governments. Such countries would not have the political will or ability to safeguard attempts at devices being transferred to a third party. Not being deterred by self-annihilation, terrorism groups could push forth their own nuclear agendas or be used as shadow fronts to carry out the attack plans by mentioned unstable governments.

===Arguments against both positions===
There are numerous arguments presented against both selective and total proliferation, generally targeting the very neorealist assumptions (such as the primacy of military security in state agendas, the weakness of international institutions, and the long-run unimportance of economic integration and globalization to state strategy) its proponents tend to make. With respect to Mearsheimer&#x27;s specific example of Europe, many economists and neoliberals argue that the economic integration of Europe through the development of the European Union has made war in most of the European continent so disastrous economically so as to serve as an effective deterrent. Constructivists take this one step further, frequently arguing that the development of EU political institutions has led or will lead to the development of a nascent European identity, which most states on the European continent wish to partake in to some degree or another, and which makes all states within or aspiring to be within the EU regard war between them as unthinkable.

As for Waltz, the general opinion is that most states are not in a position to safely guard against nuclear use, that he underestimates the long-standing antipathy in many regions, and that weak states will be unable to prevent—or will actively provide for—the disastrous possibility of nuclear terrorism. Waltz has dealt with all of these objections at some point in his work, though some scholars feel he has not adequately responded (e.g.: Betts, 2000).

The Learning Channel documentary Doomsday: &quot;On The Brink&quot; illustrated 40 years of U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons accidents. Even the 1995 Norwegian rocket incident demonstrated a potential scenario in which Russian democratization and military downsizing at the end of the Cold War did not eliminate the danger of accidental nuclear war through command and control errors. After asking: might a future Russian ruler or renegade Russian general be tempted to use nuclear weapons to make foreign policy? The documentary writers revealed a greater danger of Russian security over its nuclear stocks, but especially the ultimate danger of human nature to want the ultimate weapon of mass destruction to exercise political and military power. According to the documentary, the Soviets, Russians, and Americans came very close to global catastrophe. History and military experts agree that proliferation can be slowed, but never stopped (technology cannot be uninvented).

===Proliferation begets proliferation===
&#x27;Proliferation begets proliferation&#x27; is a concept described by professor of political science Scott Sagan in his article, &quot;Why Do States Build Nuclear Weapons?&quot;. This concept can be described as a strategic chain reaction. If one state produces a nuclear weapon it creates almost a domino effect within the region. States in the region will seek to acquire nuclear weapons to balance or eliminate the security threat. Sagan describes this reaction in his article where he states, &quot;Every time one state develops nuclear weapons to balance against its main rival, it also creates a nuclear threat to another region, which then has to initiate its own nuclear weapons program to maintain its national security&quot;. Going back through history we can see how this has taken place. When the United States demonstrated that it had nuclear power capabilities after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Russians started to develop their program in preparation for the Cold War. With the Russian military buildup, France and the United Kingdom perceived this as a security threat and therefore they pursued nuclear weapons (Sagan, p. 71). Even though proliferation causes proliferation, this does not guarantee that other states will successfully develop nuclear weapons because the economic stability of a state plays an important role in whether the state will successfully be able to acquire nuclear weapons. The article written by Dong-Jong Joo and Erik Gartzke discusses how the economy of a country determines whether they will successfully acquire nuclear weapons.

====Iran====
Former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been a frequent critic of the concept of &quot;nuclear apartheid&quot; as it has been put into practice by several countries, particularly the United States. In an interview with CNN&#x27;s Christiane Amanpour, Ahmadinejad said that Iran was &quot;against &#x27;nuclear apartheid,&#x27; which means some have the right to possess it, use the fuel, and then sell it to another country for 10 times its value. We&#x27;re against that. We say clean energy is the right of all countries. But also it is the duty and the responsibility of all countries, including ours, to set up frameworks to stop the proliferation of it.&quot; Hours after that interview, he spoke passionately in favor of Iran&#x27;s right to develop nuclear technology, claiming the nation should have the same liberties.

Iran is a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and claims that any work done in regards to nuclear technology is related only to civilian uses, which is acceptable under the treaty. In 2005, the International Atomic Energy Agency found that Iran violated its safeguards obligations under the treaty by performing uranium-enrichment in secret, after which the United Nations Security Council ordered Iran to suspend all uranium-enrichment until July 2015.

====India====
India has also been discussed in the context of &quot;nuclear apartheid&quot;. India has consistently attempted to pass measures that would call for full international disarmament, however, they have not succeeded due to protests from those states that already have nuclear weapons. In light of this, India viewed nuclear weapons as a necessary right for all nations as long as certain states were still in possession of nuclear weapons. India stated that nuclear issues were directly related to national security.

Years before India&#x27;s first underground nuclear test in 1998, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was passed. Some have argued that coercive language was used in an attempt to persuade India to sign the treaty, which was pushed for heavily by neighboring China. India viewed the treaty as a means for countries that already had nuclear weapons, primarily the five nations of the United Nations Security Council, to keep their weapons while ensuring that no other nations could develop them.

=== Security guarantees ===
In their article, &quot;The Correlates of Nuclear Proliferation,&quot; Sonali Singh and Christopher R. Way argue that states protected by a security guarantee from a great power, particularly if backed by the &quot;nuclear umbrella&quot; of extended deterrence, have less of an incentive to acquire their own nuclear weapons. States that lack such guarantees are more likely to feel their security threatened and so have greater incentives to bolster or assemble nuclear arsenals. As a result, it is then argued that bipolarity may prevent proliferation whereas multipolarity may actually influence proliferation.

<doc id="22164" wikidata="Q1760303" url="?curid=22164" title="Netlist">
<text>In electronic design, a netlist is a description of the connectivity of an electronic circuit. In its simplest form, a netlist consists of a list of the electronic components in a circuit and a list of the nodes they are connected to. A network (net) is a collection of two or more interconnected components.

The structure, complexity and representation of netlists can vary considerably, but the fundamental purpose of every netlist is to convey connectivity information. Netlists usually provide nothing more than instances, nodes, and perhaps some attributes of the components involved. If they express much more than this, they are usually considered to be a hardware description language such as Verilog or VHDL, or one of several languages specifically designed for input to simulators or hardware compilers (such as SPICE analog simulation netlists).

==Types of netlists==

Netlists can be:
* Physical (based upon physical connections) or logical (based upon logical connections)
** For example, connecting three components through one terminal of one of those components would be considered a direct &quot;logical&quot; connection, whereas each would be discrete &quot;physical&quot; connections.
* Instance-based (clustered about a component instance) or net-based (exhaustive list of connections to a particular net)
** Flat (all connections are shown) or hierarchical (connections are grouped in some way; such as which physical board or layer they are connected to. Such netlists may in addition be either &quot;folded&quot;, hiding data beneath a given level of abstraction, or &quot;unfolded&quot;, being exhaustive and thus potentially equivalent in content to flat netlists.)

==Contents and structure of a netlist==
Most netlists either contain or refer to descriptions of the parts or devices used. Each time a part is used in a netlist, this is called an &quot;instance&quot;.

These descriptions will usually list the connections that are made to that kind of device, and some basic properties of that device. These connection points are called &quot;terminals&quot; or &quot;pins&quot;, among several other names.

An &quot;instance&quot; could be anything from a MOSFET transistor or a bipolar junction transistor, to a resistor, a capacitor, or an integrated circuit chip.

Instances have &quot;terminals&quot;. In the case of a vacuum cleaner, these terminals would be the three metal prongs in the plug. Each terminal has a name, and in continuing the vacuum cleaner example, they might be &quot;Neutral&quot;, &quot;Live&quot; and &quot;Ground&quot;. Usually, each instance will have a unique name, so that if you have two instances of vacuum cleaners, one might be &quot;vac1&quot; and the other &quot;vac2&quot;. Besides their names, they might otherwise be identical.

Networks (nets) are the &quot;wires&quot; that connect things together in the circuit. There may or may not be any special attributes associated with the nets in a design, depending on the particular language the netlist is written in, and that language&#x27;s features.

Instance based netlists usually provide a list of the instances used in a design.
Along with each instance, either an ordered list of net names is provided, or a list of pairs provided, of an instance port name, along with the net name to which that port is connected. In this kind of description, the list of nets can be gathered from the connection lists, and there is no place to associate particular attributes with the nets themselves. SPICE is an example of instance-based netlists.

Net-based netlists usually describe all the instances and their attributes, then describe each net, and say which port they are connected on each instance. This allows for attributes to be associated with nets.
EDIF is probably the most famous of the net-based netlists.

==Hierarchy==

In large designs, it is a common practice to split the design into pieces, each piece becoming a &quot;definition&quot; which can be used as instances in the design. In the vacuum cleaner analogy, one might have a vacuum cleaner definition with its ports, but now this definition would also include a full description of the machine&#x27;s internal components and how they connect (motors, switches, etc.), like a wiring diagram does.

A definition which includes no instances is called a &quot;primitive&quot; (or a &quot;leaf&quot;, or other names); whereas a definition which includes instances is &quot;hierarchical&quot;.

A &quot;folded&quot; hierarchy allows a single definition to be represented several times by instances. An &quot;unfolded&quot; hierarchy does not allow a definition to be used more than once in the hierarchy.

Folded hierarchies can be extremely compact. A small netlist of just a few instances can describe designs with a very large number of instances. For example, suppose definition A is a simple primitive, like a memory cell. Then suppose definition B contains 32 instances of A; C contains 32 instances of B; D contains 32 instances of C; and E contains 32 instances of D. The design now contains 5 definitions (A through E) and 128 instances. Yet, E describes a circuit that contains over a million memory cells.

===Unfolding===
In a &quot;flat&quot; design, only primitives are instanced. Hierarchical designs can be recursively &quot;exploded&quot; (&quot;flattened&quot;) by creating a new copy (with a new name) of each definition each time it is used. If the design is highly folded, expanding it like this will result in a much larger netlist database, but preserves the hierarchy dependencies. Given a hierarchical netlist, the list of instance names in a path from the root definition to a primitive instance specifies the single unique path to that primitive. The paths to every primitive, taken together, comprise a large but flat netlist that is exactly equivalent to the compact hierarchical version.

===Backannotation===
Backannotation is data that could be added to a hierarchical netlist. Usually they are kept separate from the netlist, because several such alternate sets of data could be applied to a single netlist. These data may have been extracted from a physical design, and might provide extra information for more accurate simulations. Usually the data are composed of a hierarchical path and a piece of data for that primitive or finding the values of RC delay due to interconnection.

===Inheritance===
Another concept often used in netlists is that of inheritance. Suppose a definition of a capacitor has an associated attribute called &quot;Capacitance&quot;, corresponding to the physical property of the same name, with a default value of &quot;100 pF&quot; (100 picofarads). Each instance of this capacitor might also have such an attribute, only with a different value of capacitance. And other instances might not associate any capacitance at all. In the case where no capacitance is specified for an instance, the instance will &quot;inherit&quot; the 100 pF value from its definition. A value specified will &quot;override&quot; the value on the definition. If a great number of attributes end up being the same as on the definition, a great amount of information can be &quot;inherited&quot;, and not have to be redundantly specified in the netlist, saving space, and making the design easier to read by both machines and people.

<text>Nuclear disarmament is the act of reducing or eliminating nuclear weapons. Its end state can also be a nuclear-weapons-free world, in which nuclear weapons are completely eliminated. The term denuclearization is also used to describe the process leading to complete nuclear disarmament.

Disarmament and non-proliferation treaties have been agreed upon because of the extreme danger intrinsic to nuclear war and the possession of nuclear weapons.

Proponents of nuclear disarmament say that it would lessen the probability of nuclear war occurring, especially considering accidents or retaliatory strikes from false alarms. Critics of nuclear disarmament say that it would undermine deterrence and make conventional wars more common.

==Organizations==
Nuclear disarmament groups include the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Peace Action, Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, Greenpeace, Soka Gakkai International, International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, Mayors for Peace, Global Zero, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, and the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation. There have been many large anti-nuclear demonstrations and protests. On June 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City&#x27;s Central Park against nuclear weapons and for an end to the Cold War arms race. It was the largest anti-nuclear protest and the largest political demonstration in American history.

In recent years, some U.S. elder statesmen have also advocated nuclear disarmament. Sam Nunn, William Perry, Henry Kissinger, and George Shultz have called upon governments to embrace the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons, and in various op-ed columns have proposed an ambitious program of urgent steps to that end. The four have created the Nuclear Security Project to advance this agenda. Organisations such as Global Zero, an international non-partisan group of 300 world leaders dedicated to eliminating all nuclear weapons, have also been established.

==History==


In 1945 in the New Mexico desert, American scientists conducted &quot;Trinity&quot;, the first nuclear weapons test, marking the beginning of the atomic age. Even before the Trinity test, national leaders debated the impact of nuclear weapons on domestic and foreign policy. Also involved in the debate about nuclear weapons policy was the scientific community, through professional associations such as the Federation of Atomic Scientists and the Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs.

On August 6, 1945, towards the end of World War II, the &quot;Little Boy&quot; device was detonated over the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Exploding with a yield equivalent to 12,500 tonnes of TNT, the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly 50,000 buildings (including the headquarters of the 2nd General Army and Fifth Division) and killed 70,000–80,000 people outright, with total deaths being around 90,000–146,000. Detonation of the &quot;Fat Man&quot; device exploded over the Japanese city of Nagasaki three days later on August 9, 1945, destroying 60% of the city and killing 35,000–40,000 people outright, though up to 40,000 additional deaths may have occurred over some time after that. Subsequently, the world&#x27;s nuclear weapons stockpiles grew.

In 1946 the Truman administration commissioned the Acheson-Lilienthal Report, which proposed the international control of the nuclear fuel cycle, revealing atomic energy technology to the USSR, and the decommissioning of all existing nuclear weapons through the new United Nations (UN) system, via the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission (UNAEC). With key modifications, the report became US policy in the form of the Baruch Plan, which was presented to the UNAEC during its first meeting in June 1946. As Cold War tensions emerged, it became clear that Stalin wanted to develop his own atomic bomb and that the United States insisted on an enforcement regime that would have overridden the UN Security Council veto. This soon led to deadlock in the UNAEC.

Operation Crossroads was a series of nuclear weapon tests conducted by the United States at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean in the summer of 1946. Its purpose was to test the effect of nuclear weapons on naval ships. Pressure to cancel Operation Crossroads came from scientists and diplomats. Manhattan Project scientists argued that further nuclear testing was unnecessary and environmentally dangerous. A Los Alamos study warned &quot;the water near a recent surface explosion will be a &#x27;witch&#x27;s brew&#x27; of radioactivity&quot;. To prepare the atoll for the nuclear tests, Bikini&#x27;s native residents were evicted from their homes and resettled on smaller, uninhabited islands where they were unable to sustain themselves.

Radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing was first drawn to public attention in 1954 when an American hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific contaminated the crew of the Japanese fishing boat &quot;Lucky Dragon&quot;. One of the fishermen died in Japan seven months later. The incident caused widespread concern around the world and &quot;provided a decisive impetus for the emergence of the anti-nuclear weapons movement in many countries&quot;. The anti-nuclear weapons movement grew rapidly because for many people the atomic bomb &quot;encapsulated the very worst direction in which society was moving&quot;.

==Nuclear disarmament movement==



Peace movements emerged in Japan and in 1954 they converged to form a unified &quot;Japanese Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs&quot;. Japanese opposition to the Pacific nuclear weapons tests was widespread, and &quot;an estimated 35 million signatures were collected on petitions calling for bans on nuclear weapons&quot;. In the United Kingdom, the first Aldermaston March organised by the Direct Action Committee and supported by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament took place on Easter 1958, when several thousand people marched for four days from Trafalgar Square, London, to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment close to Aldermaston in Berkshire, England, to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons. CND organised Aldermaston marches into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day events.

On November 1, 1961, at the height of the Cold War, about 50,000 women brought together by Women Strike for Peace marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against nuclear weapons. It was the largest national women&#x27;s peace protest of the 20th century.

In 1958, Linus Pauling and his wife presented the United Nations with the petition signed by more than 11,000 scientists calling for an end to nuclear-weapon testing. The &quot;Baby Tooth Survey&quot;, headed by Louise Reiss, demonstrated conclusively in 1961 that above-ground nuclear testing posed significant public health risks in the form of radioactive fallout spread primarily via milk from cows that had ingested contaminated grass. Public pressure and the research results subsequently led to a moratorium on above-ground nuclear weapons testing, followed by the Partial Test Ban Treaty, signed in 1963 by John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev. On the day that the treaty went into force, the Nobel Prize Committee awarded Pauling the Nobel Peace Prize, describing him as &quot;Linus Carl Pauling, who ever since 1946 has campaigned ceaselessly, not only against nuclear weapons tests, not only against the spread of these armaments, not only against their very use, but against all warfare as a means of solving international conflicts.&quot; Pauling started the International League of Humanists in 1974. He was president of the scientific advisory board of the World Union for Protection of Life and also one of the signatories of the Dubrovnik-Philadelphia Statement.

In the 1980s, a movement for nuclear disarmament again gained strength in the light of the weapons build-up and statements of US President Ronald Reagan. Reagan had &quot;a world free of nuclear weapons&quot; as his personal mission, and was largely scorned for this in Europe. Reagan was able to start discussions on nuclear disarmament with Soviet Union. He changed the name &quot;SALT&quot; (Strategic Arms Limitation Talks) to &quot;START&quot; (Strategic Arms Reduction Talks).

On June 3, 1981, William Thomas launched the White House Peace Vigil in Washington, D.C. He was later joined on the vigil by anti-nuclear activists Concepcion Picciotto and Ellen Benjamin.

On June 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City&#x27;s Central Park against nuclear weapons and for an end to the cold war arms race. It was the largest anti-nuclear protest and the largest political demonstration in American history. International Day of Nuclear Disarmament protests were held on June 20, 1983, at 50 sites across the United States. Large demonstrations and the disruption of US naval visits led the New Zealand government to ban nuclear-armed and powered ships from entering the country&#x27;s territorial waters in 1984. Hundreds of thousands of people took part in Palm Sunday and other demonstrations for peace and nuclear disarmament in Australia during the mid-1980s. In 1986, hundreds of people walked from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. in the Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament. There were many Nevada Desert Experience protests and peace camps at the Nevada Test Site during the 1980s and 1990s.

On May 1, 2005, 40,000 anti-nuclear/anti-war protesters marched past the United Nations in New York, 60 years after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 2008, 2009, and 2010, there have been protests about, and campaigns against, several new nuclear reactor proposals in the United States.

There is an annual protest against U.S. nuclear weapons research at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California and in the 2007 protest, 64 people were arrested. There have been a series of protests at the Nevada Test Site and in the April 2007 Nevada Desert Experience protest, 39 people were cited by police. There have been anti-nuclear protests at Naval Base Kitsap for many years, and several in 2008.

In 2017, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize &quot;for its work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its ground-breaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition of such weapons&quot;.

===World Peace Council===

One of the earliest peace organisations to emerge after the Second World War was the World Peace Council, which was directed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union through the Soviet Peace Committee. Its origins lay in the Communist Information Bureau&#x27;s (Cominform) doctrine, put forward 1947, that the world was divided between peace-loving progressive forces led by the Soviet Union and warmongering capitalist countries led by the United States. In 1949, Cominform directed that peace &quot;should now become the pivot of the entire activity of the Communist Parties&quot;, and most western Communist parties followed this policy. Lawrence Wittner, a historian of the post-war peace movement, argues that the Soviet Union devoted great efforts to the promotion of the WPC in the early post-war years because it feared an American attack and American superiority of arms at a time when the USA possessed the atom bomb but the Soviet Union had not yet developed it.

In 1950, the WPC launched its Stockholm Appeal calling for the absolute prohibition of nuclear weapons. The campaign won support, collecting, it is said, 560 million signatures in Europe, most from socialist countries, including 10 million in France (including that of the young Jacques Chirac), and 155 million signatures in the Soviet Union – the entire adult population. Several non-aligned peace groups who had distanced themselves from the WPC advised their supporters not to sign the Appeal.

The WPC had uneasy relations with the non-aligned peace movement and has been described as being caught in contradictions as &quot;it sought to become a broad world movement while being instrumentalized increasingly to serve foreign policy in the Soviet Union and nominally socialist countries.&quot; From the 1950s until the late 1980s it tried to use non-aligned peace organizations to spread the Soviet point of view. At first there was limited co-operation between such groups and the WPC, but western delegates who tried to criticize the Soviet Union or the WPC&#x27;s silence about Russian armaments were often shouted down at WPC conferences and by the early 1960s they had dissociated themselves from the WPC.

==Arms reduction treaties==

After the 1986 Reykjavík Summit between U.S. President Ronald Reagan and the new Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, the United States and the Soviet Union concluded two important nuclear arms reduction treaties: the INF Treaty (1987) and START I (1991). After the end of the Cold War, the United States and the Russian Federation concluded the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (2003) and the New START Treaty (2010). The US withdrew from the INF Treaty in 2019 under president Donald Trump, and launched the United States–Russia Strategic Stability Dialogue (SSD) in 2021 under president Joe Biden.

When the extreme danger intrinsic to nuclear war and the possession of nuclear weapons became apparent to all sides during the Cold War, a series of disarmament and nonproliferation treaties were agreed upon between the United States, the Soviet Union, and several other states throughout the world. Many of these treaties involved years of negotiations, and seemed to result in important steps in arms reductions and reducing the risk of nuclear war.

===Key treaties===
* Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT) 1963: Prohibited all testing of nuclear weapons except underground.
* Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)—signed 1968, came into force 1970: An international treaty (currently with 189 member states) to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. The treaty has three main pillars: nonproliferation, disarmament, and the right to peacefully use nuclear technology.
* Interim Agreement on Offensive Arms (SALT I) 1972: The Soviet Union and the United States agreed to a freeze in the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) that they would deploy.
* Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) 1972: The United States and Soviet Union could deploy ABM interceptors at two sites, each with up to 100 ground-based launchers for ABM interceptor missiles. In a 1974 Protocol, the US and Soviet Union agreed to only deploy an ABM system to one site.
* Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT II) 1979: Replacing SALT I, SALT II limited both the Soviet Union and the United States to an equal number of ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers. Also placed limits on Multiple Independent Reentry Vehicles (MIRVS).
* Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) 1987: Banned US and Soviet Union land-based ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and missile launchers with ranges of 500–1,000 kilometers (310–620 mi) (short medium-range) and 1,000–5,500 km (620–3,420 mi) (intermediate-range).
* Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I)—signed 1991, ratified 1994: Limited long-range nuclear forces in the United States and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union to 6,000 attributed warheads on 1,600 ballistic missiles and bombers.
* Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II (START II)—signed 1993, never put into force: START II was a bilateral agreement between the US and Russia which attempted to commit each side to deploy no more than 3,000 to 3,500 warheads by December 2007 and also included a prohibition against deploying multiple independent reentry vehicles (MIRVs) on intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)
* Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT or Moscow Treaty)—signed 2002, into force 2003: A very loose treaty that is often criticized by arms control advocates for its ambiguity and lack of depth, Russia and the United States agreed to reduce their &quot;strategic nuclear warheads&quot; (a term that remained undefined in the treaty) to between 1,700 and 2,200 by 2012. Was superseded by New START Treaty in 2010.
* Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)—signed 1996, not yet in force: The CTBT is an international treaty (currently with 181 state signatures and 148 state ratifications) that bans all nuclear explosions in all environments. While the treaty is not in force, Russia has not tested a nuclear weapon since 1990 and the United States has not since 1992.
* New START Treaty—signed 2010, into force in 2011: replaces SORT treaty, reduces deployed nuclear warheads by about half, will remain into force until 2026.
* Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons—signed 2017, entered into force on January 22, 2021: prohibits possession, manufacture, development, and testing of nuclear weapons, or assistance in such activities, by its parties.
Only one country (South Africa) has been known to ever dismantle an indigenously developed nuclear arsenal completely. The apartheid government of South Africa produced half a dozen crude fission weapons during the 1980s, but they were dismantled in the early 1990s.

==United Nations==
In its landmark resolution 1653 of 1961, &quot;Declaration on the prohibition of the use of nuclear and thermo-nuclear weapons,&quot; the UN General Assembly stated that use of nuclear weaponry &quot;would exceed even the scope of war and cause indiscriminate suffering and destruction to mankind and civilization and, as such, is contrary to the rules of international law and to the laws of humanity&quot;.

The UN Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) is a department of the United Nations Secretariat established in January 1998 as part of the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan&#x27;s plan to reform the UN as presented in his report to the General Assembly in July 1997.

Its goal is to promote nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and the strengthening of the disarmament regimes in respect to other weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological weapons. It also promotes disarmament efforts in the area of conventional weapons, especially land mines and small arms, which are often the weapons of choice in contemporary conflicts.

Following the retirement of Sergio Duarte in February 2012, Angela Kane was appointed as the new High Representative for Disarmament Affairs.

On July 7, 2017, a UN conference adopted the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons with the backing of 122 states. It opened for signature on September 20, 2017.

The 2022 United Nations Disarmament Yearbook described highlights and challenges in the previous year. As reported by the UN Press, &quot;On the one hand, we saw record levels of military spending and division within important arms-control frameworks, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  On the other hand, we also saw the first-ever Meeting of States Parties to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons&quot;

==U.S. nuclear policy==
Despite a general trend toward disarmament in the early 2000s, the George W. Bush administration repeatedly pushed to fund policies that would allegedly make nuclear weapons more usable in the post–Cold War environment. To date the U.S. Congress has refused to fund many of these policies. However, some feel that even considering such programs harms the credibility of the United States as a proponent of nonproliferation.

===Controversial U.S. nuclear policies===
* Reliable Replacement Warhead Program (RRW): This program seeks to replace existing warheads with a smaller number of warhead types designed to be easier to maintain without testing. Critics charge that this would lead to a new generation of nuclear weapons and would increase pressures to test. Congress has not funded this program.
* Complex Transformation: Complex transformation, formerly known as Complex 2030, is an effort to shrink the U.S. nuclear weapons complex and restore the ability to produce &quot;pits&quot;, the fissile cores of the primaries of U.S. thermonuclear weapons. Critics see it as an upgrade to the entire nuclear weapons complex to support the production and maintenance of the new generation of nuclear weapons. Congress has not funded this program.
* Nuclear bunker buster: Formally known as the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP), this program aimed to modify an existing gravity bomb to penetrate into soil and rock in order to destroy underground targets. Critics argue that this would lower the threshold for use of nuclear weapons. Congress did not fund this proposal, which was later withdrawn.
* Missile Defense: Formerly known as National Missile Defense, this program seeks to build a network of interceptor missiles to protect the United States and its allies from incoming missiles, including nuclear-armed missiles. Critics have argued that this would impede nuclear disarmament and possibly stimulate a nuclear arms race. Elements of missile defense are being deployed in Poland and the Czech Republic, despite Russian opposition.

Former U.S. officials Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Bill Perry, and Sam Nunn (aka &#x27;The Gang of Four&#x27; on nuclear deterrence) proposed in January 2007 that the United States rededicate itself to the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons, concluding: &quot;We endorse setting the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons and working energetically on the actions required to achieve that goal.&quot; Arguing a year later that &quot;with nuclear weapons more widely available, deterrence is decreasingly effective and increasingly hazardous,&quot; the authors concluded that although &quot;it is tempting and easy to say we can&#x27;t get there from here, [...] we must chart a course toward that goal.&quot; During his presidential campaign, former U.S. President Barack Obama pledged to &quot;set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons, and pursue it.&quot;

===U.S. programs to reduce risk of nuclear terrorism===
The United States has taken the lead in ensuring that nuclear materials globally are properly safeguarded. A popular program that has received bipartisan domestic support for over a decade is the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program (CTR). While this program has been deemed a success, many believe that its funding levels need to be increased so as to ensure that all dangerous nuclear materials are secured in the most expeditious manner possible. The CTR program has led to several other innovative and important nonproliferation programs that need to continue to be a budget priority in order to ensure that nuclear weapons do not spread to actors hostile to the United States.

Key programs:
* Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR): The CTR program provides funding to help Russia secure materials that might be used in nuclear or chemical weapons as well as to dismantle weapons of mass destruction and their associated infrastructure in Russia.
* Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI): Expanding on the success of the CTR, the GTRI will expand nuclear weapons and material securing and dismantlement activities to states outside of the former Soviet Union.

While the vast majority of states have adhered to the stipulations of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, a few states have either refused to sign the treaty or have pursued nuclear weapons programs while not being members of the treaty. Many view the pursuit of nuclear weapons by these states as a threat to nonproliferation and world peace.

==Semiotics==
The precise use of terminology in the context of disarmament may have important implications for political Signaling theory. In the case of North Korea, &quot;denuclearization&quot; has historically been interpreted as different from &quot;disarmament&quot; by including withdrawal of American nuclear capabilities from the region. More recently, this term has become provocative due to its comparisons to the collapse of the Gaddafi regime after disarmament. The Biden administration has been criticized for its reaffirming of a strategy of denuclearization with Korea and Japan, as opposed to a &quot;freeze&quot; or &quot;pause&quot; on new nuclear developments.

Similarly, the term &quot;irreversible&quot; has been argued to set an impossible standard for states to disarm.

==Recent developments==

Eliminating nuclear weapons has long been an aim of the pacifist left. But now many mainstream politicians, academic analysts, and retired military leaders also advocate nuclear disarmament. Sam Nunn, William Perry, Henry Kissinger, and George Shultz have called upon governments to embrace the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons, and in three op-eds in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; proposed an ambitious program of urgent steps to that end. The four have created the Nuclear Security Project to advance this agenda. Nunn reinforced that agenda during a speech at the Harvard Kennedy School on October 21, 2008, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m much more concerned about a terrorist without a return address that cannot be deterred than I am about deliberate war between nuclear powers. You can&#x27;t deter a group who is willing to commit suicide. We are in a different era. You have to understand the world has changed.&quot; In 2010, the four were featured in a documentary film entitled &quot;Nuclear Tipping Point&quot;. The film is a visual and historical depiction of the ideas laid forth in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; op-eds and reinforces their commitment to a world without nuclear weapons and the steps that can be taken to reach that goal.

Global Zero is an international non-partisan group of 300 world leaders dedicated to achieving nuclear disarmament. The initiative, launched in December 2008, promotes a phased withdrawal and verification for the destruction of all devices held by official and unofficial members of the nuclear club. The Global Zero campaign works toward building an international consensus and a sustained global movement of leaders and citizens for the elimination of nuclear weapons. Goals include the initiation of United States-Russia bilateral negotiations for reductions to 1,000 total warheads each and commitments from the other key nuclear weapons countries to participate in multilateral negotiations for phased reductions of nuclear arsenals. Global Zero works to expand the diplomatic dialogue with key governments and continue to develop policy proposals on the critical issues related to the elimination of nuclear weapons.

The International Conference on Nuclear Disarmament took place in Oslo in February 2008, and was organized by The Government of Norway, the Nuclear Threat Initiative and the Hoover Institute. The Conference was entitled &quot;Achieving the Vision of a World Free of Nuclear Weapons&quot; and had the purpose of building consensus between nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states in relation to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.
The Tehran International Conference on Disarmament and Non-Proliferation took place in Tehran in April 2010. The conference was held shortly after the signing of the New START, and resulted in a call of action toward eliminating all nuclear weapons. Representatives from 60 countries were invited to the conference. Non-governmental organizations were also present.

Among the prominent figures who have called for the abolition of nuclear weapons are &quot;the philosopher Bertrand Russell, the entertainer Steve Allen, CNN&#x27;s Ted Turner, former Senator Claiborne Pell, Notre Dame president Theodore Hesburgh, South African Bishop Desmond Tutu and the Dalai Lama&quot;.

Others have argued that nuclear weapons have made the world relatively safer, with peace through deterrence and through the stability–instability paradox, including in south Asia. Kenneth Waltz has argued that nuclear weapons have created a nuclear peace, and further nuclear weapon proliferation might even help avoid the large scale conventional wars that were so common prior to their invention at the end of World War II. In the July 2012 issue of Foreign Affairs Waltz took issue with the view of most U.S., European, and Israeli, commentators and policymakers that a nuclear-armed Iran would be unacceptable. Instead Waltz argues that it would probably be the best possible outcome, as it would restore stability to the Middle East by balancing Israel&#x27;s regional monopoly on nuclear weapons. Professor John Mueller of Ohio State University, the author of &quot;Atomic Obsession&quot;, has also dismissed the need to interfere with Iran&#x27;s nuclear program and expressed that arms control measures are counterproductive. During a 2010 lecture at the University of Missouri, which was broadcast by C-SPAN, Mueller has also argued that the threat from nuclear weapons, especially nuclear terrorism, has been exaggerated, both in the popular media and by officials.
Former Secretary Kissinger says there is a new danger, which cannot be addressed by deterrence: &quot;The classical notion of deterrence was that there was some consequences before which aggressors and evildoers would recoil. In a world of suicide bombers, that calculation doesn&#x27;t operate in any comparable way&quot;. George Shultz has said, &quot;If you think of the people who are doing suicide attacks, and people like that get a nuclear weapon, they are almost by definition not deterrable&quot;.

Andrew Bacevich wrote that there is no feasible scenario under which the US could sensibly use nuclear weapons:For the United States, they are becoming unnecessary, even as a deterrent. Certainly, they are unlikely to dissuade the adversaries most likely to employ such weapons against us -- Islamic extremists intent on acquiring their own nuclear capability. If anything, the opposite is true. By retaining a strategic arsenal in readiness (and by insisting without qualification that the dropping of atomic bombs on two Japanese cities in 1945 was justified), the United States continues tacitly to sustain the view that nuclear weapons play a legitimate role in international politics ... .In &quot;The Limits of Safety&quot;, Scott Sagan documented numerous incidents in US military history that could have produced a nuclear war by accident. He concluded:while the military organizations controlling U.S. nuclear forces during the Cold War performed this task with less success than we know, they performed with more success than we &quot;should&quot; have reasonably predicted. The problems identified in this book were not the product of incompetent organizations. They reflect the inherent limits of organizational safety. Recognizing that simple truth is the first and most important step toward a safer future.

On January 3, 2022, the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, China, France, Russia, Britain, and the United States issued a statement on prevention of nuclear war, affirming that &quot;a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.&quot;

On February 21, 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin suspended Russia&#x27;s participation in the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States.

<text>In mathematics, more specifically in general topology and related branches, a net or Moore–Smith sequence is a function whose domain is a directed set. The codomain of this function is usually some topological space. Nets directly generalize the concept of a sequence in a metric space. Nets are primarily used in the fields of analysis and topology, where they are used to characterize many important topological properties that (in general), sequences are unable to characterize (this shortcoming of sequences motivated the study of sequential spaces and Fréchet–Urysohn spaces). Nets are in one-to-one correspondence with filters.

== History ==

The concept of a net was first introduced by E. H. Moore and Herman L. Smith in 1922. The term &quot;net&quot; was coined by John L. Kelley.

The related concept of a filter was developed in 1937 by Henri Cartan.

==Definitions==

A directed set is a non-empty set formula_1 together with a preorder, typically automatically assumed to be denoted by formula_2 (unless indicated otherwise), with the property that it is also () , which means that for any formula_3 there exists some formula_4 such that formula_5 and formula_6 
In words, this property means that given any two elements (of formula_1), there is always some element that is &quot;above&quot; both of them (greater than or equal to each); in this way, directed sets generalize the notion of &quot;a direction&quot; in a mathematically rigorous way. Importantly though, directed sets are required to be total orders or even partial orders. A directed set may have the greatest element. In this case, the conditions formula_5 and formula_9 cannot be replaced by the strict inequalities formula_10 and formula_11, since the strict inequalities cannot be satisfied if &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot; is the greatest element.

A net in formula_12, denoted formula_13, is a function of the form formula_14 whose domain formula_1 is some directed set, and whose values are formula_16. Elements of a net&#x27;s domain are called its . When the set formula_12 is clear from context it is simply called a net, and one assumes formula_1 is a directed set with preorder formula_19 Notation for nets varies, for example using angled brackets formula_20. As is common in algebraic topology notation, the filled disk or &quot;bullet&quot; stands in place of the input variable or index formula_21.

=== Limits of nets ===
A net formula_13 is said to be or a set formula_23 if there exists some formula_21 such that for every formula_25 with formula_26 the point formula_27 A point formula_28 is called a or of the net formula_29 in formula_12 whenever:
:for every open neighborhood formula_31 of formula_32 the net formula_29 is eventually in formula_31,
expressed equivalently as: the net or ; and variously denoted as:formula_35If formula_12 is clear from context, it may be omitted from the notation.

If formula_37 and this limit is unique (i.e. formula_38 only for formula_39) then one writes:formula_40using the equal sign in place of the arrow formula_41 In a Hausdorff space, every net has at most one limit, and the limit of a convergent net is always unique.
Some authors do not distinguish between the notations formula_42 and formula_37, but this can lead to ambiguities if the ambient space &quot;formula_12&quot; is not Hausdorff.

=== Cluster points of nets ===

A net formula_13 is said to be or formula_23 if for every formula_21 there exists some formula_25 such that formula_49 and formula_27 A point formula_28 is said to be an or &quot;cluster point&quot; of a net if for every neighborhood formula_31 of formula_32 the net is frequently/cofinally in formula_54 In fact, formula_28 is a cluster point if and only if it has a subnet that converges to formula_56 The set formula_57 of all cluster points of formula_29 in formula_12 is equal to formula_60 for each formula_61, where formula_62.

===Subnets===

The analogue of &quot;subsequence&quot; for nets is the notion of a &quot;subnet&quot;. There are several different non-equivalent definitions of &quot;subnet&quot; and this article will use the definition introduced in 1970 by Stephen Willard, which is as follows: 
If formula_13 and formula_64 are nets then formula_65 is called a or of formula_29 if there exists an order-preserving map formula_67 such that formula_68 is a cofinal subset of formula_1 and 
formula_70 
The map formula_67 is called and an if whenever formula_72 then formula_73 
The set formula_68 being in formula_1 means that for every formula_76 there exists some formula_77 such that formula_78

If formula_28 is a cluster point of some subnet of formula_29 then formula_81 is also a cluster point of formula_82

===Ultranets===

A net formula_29 in set formula_12 is called a or an if for every subset formula_85 formula_29 is eventually in formula_23 or formula_29 is eventually in the complement formula_89 

Every constant net is a (trivial) ultranet. Every subnet of an ultranet is an ultranet. Assuming the axiom of choice, every net has some subnet that is an ultranet, but no nontrivial ultranets have ever been constructed explicitly. 
If formula_13 is an ultranet in formula_12 and formula_92 is a function then formula_93 is an ultranet in formula_94 

Given formula_95 an ultranet clusters at formula_81 if and only it converges to formula_56

===Cauchy nets===

A Cauchy net generalizes the notion of Cauchy sequence to nets defined on uniform spaces.

A net formula_13 is a if for every entourage formula_99 there exists formula_4 such that for all formula_101 formula_102 is a member of formula_103 More generally, in a Cauchy space, a net formula_29 is Cauchy if the filter generated by the net is a Cauchy filter.

A topological vector space (TVS) is called if every Cauchy net converges to some point. A normed space, which is a special type of topological vector space, is a complete TVS (equivalently, a Banach space) if and only if every Cauchy sequence converges to some point (a property that is called ). Although Cauchy nets are not needed to describe completeness of normed spaces, they are needed to describe completeness of more general (possibly non-normable) topological vector spaces.

==Characterizations of topological properties==

Virtually all concepts of topology can be rephrased in the language of nets and limits. This may be useful to guide the intuition since the notion of limit of a net is very similar to that of limit of a sequence. The following set of theorems and lemmas help cement that similarity:

=== Closed sets and closure ===

A subset formula_105 is closed in formula_12 if and only if every limit point in formula_12 of a net in formula_23 necessarily lies in formula_23.
Explicitly, this means that if formula_110 is a net with formula_111 for all formula_61, and formula_113 in formula_114 then formula_115

More generally, if formula_105 is any subset, the closure of formula_23 is the set of points formula_118 with formula_119 for some net formula_120 in formula_23. 

=== Open sets and characterizations of topologies ===

A subset formula_105 is open if and only if no net in formula_123 converges to a point of formula_124 Also, subset formula_105 is open if and only if every net converging to an element of formula_23 is eventually contained in formula_124 
It is these characterizations of &quot;open subset&quot; that allow nets to characterize topologies. 
Topologies can also be characterized by closed subsets since a set is open if and only if its complement is closed. So the characterizations of &quot;closed set&quot; in terms of nets can also be used to characterize topologies. 

=== Continuity ===

A function formula_92 between topological spaces is continuous at a point formula_81 if and only if for every net formula_13 in the domain, formula_131 in formula_12 implies formula_133 in formula_94 
Briefly, a function formula_92 is continuous if and only if formula_136 in formula_12 implies formula_138 in formula_94 
In general, this statement would not be true if the word &quot;net&quot; was replaced by &quot;sequence&quot;; that is, it is necessary to allow for directed sets other than just the natural numbers if formula_12 is not a first-countable space (or not a sequential space).
(formula_141) 
Let formula_142 be continuous at point formula_32 and let formula_13 be a net such that formula_145
Then for every open neighborhood formula_31 of formula_147 its preimage under formula_148 formula_149 is a neighborhood of formula_81 (by the continuity of formula_142 at formula_81).
Thus the interior of formula_153 which is denoted by formula_154 is an open neighborhood of formula_32 and consequently formula_29 is eventually in formula_157 Therefore formula_158 is eventually in formula_159 and thus also eventually in formula_160 which is a subset of formula_54 Thus formula_162 and this direction is proven.

(formula_163) 
Let formula_81 be a point such that for every net formula_13 such that formula_166 formula_167 Now suppose that formula_142 is not continuous at formula_56
Then there is a neighborhood formula_31 of formula_171 whose preimage under formula_148 formula_153 is not a neighborhood of formula_56 Because formula_175 necessarily formula_176 Now the set of open neighborhoods of formula_81 with the containment preorder is a directed set (since the intersection of every two such neighborhoods is an open neighborhood of formula_81 as well).

We construct a net formula_13 such that for every open neighborhood of formula_81 whose index is formula_181 formula_182 is a point in this neighborhood that is not in formula_99; that there is always such a point follows from the fact that no open neighborhood of formula_81 is included in formula_99 (because by assumption, formula_99 is not a neighborhood of formula_81).
It follows that formula_188 is not in formula_54

Now, for every open neighborhood formula_190 of formula_32 this neighborhood is a member of the directed set whose index we denote formula_192 For every formula_193 the member of the directed set whose index is formula_194 is contained within formula_190; therefore formula_196 Thus formula_145 and by our assumption formula_167
But formula_199 is an open neighborhood of formula_171 and thus formula_188 is eventually in formula_199 and therefore also in formula_203 in contradiction to formula_188 not being in formula_31 for every formula_206
This is a contradiction so formula_142 must be continuous at formula_56 This completes the proof. 
=== Compactness ===

A space formula_12 is compact if and only if every net formula_13 in formula_12 has a subnet with a limit in formula_212 This can be seen as a generalization of the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem and Heine–Borel theorem.
(formula_141) 
First, suppose that formula_12 is compact. We will need the following observation (see finite intersection property). Let formula_215 be any non-empty set and formula_216 be a collection of closed subsets of formula_12 such that formula_218 for each finite formula_219 Then formula_220 as well. Otherwise, formula_221 would be an open cover for formula_12 with no finite subcover contrary to the compactness of formula_212

Let formula_13 be a net in formula_12 directed by formula_226 For every formula_21 define
formula_228
The collection formula_229 has the property that every finite subcollection has non-empty intersection. Thus, by the remark above, we have that
formula_230
and this is precisely the set of cluster points of formula_82 By the proof given in the next section, it is equal to the set of limits of convergent subnets of formula_82 Thus formula_29 has a convergent subnet.

(formula_163) 
Conversely, suppose that every net in formula_12 has a convergent subnet. For the sake of contradiction, let formula_236 be an open cover of formula_12 with no finite subcover. Consider formula_238 Observe that formula_239 is a directed set under inclusion and for each formula_240 there exists an formula_241 such that formula_242 for all formula_243 Consider the net formula_244 This net cannot have a convergent subnet, because for each formula_28 there exists formula_246 such that formula_247 is a neighbourhood of formula_81; however, for all formula_249 we have that formula_250 This is a contradiction and completes the proof.
===Cluster and limit points===

The set of cluster points of a net is equal to the set of limits of its convergent subnets.
Let formula_13 be a net in a topological space formula_12 (where as usual formula_1 automatically assumed to be a directed set) and also let formula_254 If formula_255 is a limit of a subnet of formula_29 then formula_255 is a cluster point of formula_82

Conversely, assume that formula_255 is a cluster point of formula_82
Let formula_261 be the set of pairs formula_262 where formula_31 is an open neighborhood of formula_255 in formula_12 and formula_21 is such that formula_267
The map formula_268 mapping formula_262 to formula_270 is then cofinal.
Moreover, giving formula_261 the product order (the neighborhoods of formula_255 are ordered by inclusion) makes it a directed set, and the net formula_273 defined by formula_274 converges to formula_275
A net has a limit if and only if all of its subnets have limits. In that case, every limit of the net is also a limit of every subnet.

===Other properties===

In general, a net in a space formula_12 can have more than one limit, but if formula_12 is a Hausdorff space, the limit of a net, if it exists, is unique. Conversely, if formula_12 is not Hausdorff, then there exists a net on formula_12 with two distinct limits. Thus the uniqueness of the limit is to the Hausdorff condition on the space, and indeed this may be taken as the definition. This result depends on the directedness condition; a set indexed by a general preorder or partial order may have distinct limit points even in a Hausdorff space.

==Relation to filters==
A filter is a related idea in topology that allows for a general definition for convergence in general topological spaces. The two ideas are equivalent in the sense that they give the same concept of convergence. More specifically, every filter base induces an using the filter&#x27;s pointed sets, and convergence of the filter base implies convergence of the associated net. Similarly, any net formula_280 in formula_12 induces a filter base of tails formula_282 where the filter in formula_12 generated by this filter base is called the net&#x27;s . Convergence of the net implies convergence of the eventuality filter. This correspondence allows for any theorem that can be proven with one concept to be proven with the other. For instance, continuity of a function from one topological space to the other can be characterized either by the convergence of a net in the domain implying the convergence of the corresponding net in the codomain, or by the same statement with filter bases.

Robert G. Bartle argues that despite their equivalence, it is useful to have both concepts. He argues that nets are enough like sequences to make natural proofs and definitions in analogy to sequences, especially ones using sequential elements, such as is common in analysis, while filters are most useful in algebraic topology. In any case, he shows how the two can be used in combination to prove various theorems in general topology.

The learning curve for using nets is typically much less steep than that for filters, which is why many mathematicians, especially analysts, prefer them over filters. However, filters, and especially ultrafilters, have some important technical advantages over nets that ultimately result in nets being encountered much less often than filters outside of the fields of analysis and topology.

==As generalization of sequences==

Every non-empty totally ordered set is directed. Therefore, every function on such a set is a net. In particular, the natural numbers formula_284 together with the usual integer comparison formula_2 preorder form the example of a directed set. A sequence is a function on the natural numbers, so every sequence formula_286 in a topological space formula_12 can be considered a net in formula_12 defined on formula_289 Conversely, any net whose domain is the natural numbers is a sequence because by definition, a sequence in formula_12 is just a function from formula_291 into formula_212 It is in this way that nets are generalizations of sequences: rather than being defined on a countable linearly ordered set (formula_284), a net is defined on an arbitrary directed set. Nets are frequently denoted using notation that is similar to (and inspired by) that used with sequences. For example, the subscript notation formula_182 is taken from sequences.

Similarly, every limit of a sequence and limit of a function can be interpreted as a limit of a net. Specifically, the net is eventually in a subset formula_23 of formula_12 if there exists an formula_297 such that for every integer formula_298 the point formula_299 is in formula_124 So formula_301 if and only if for every neighborhood formula_99 of formula_303 the net is eventually in formula_103 The net is frequently in a subset formula_23 of formula_12 if and only if for every formula_297 there exists some integer formula_308 such that formula_309 that is, if and only if infinitely many elements of the sequence are in formula_124 Thus a point formula_311 is a cluster point of the net if and only if every neighborhood formula_99 of formula_255 contains infinitely many elements of the sequence.

In the context of topology, sequences do not fully encode all information about functions between topological spaces. In particular, the following two conditions are, in general, not equivalent for a map formula_142 between topological spaces formula_12 and formula_316:

#The map formula_142 is continuous in the topological sense;
#Given any point formula_81 in formula_114 and any sequence in formula_12 converging to formula_32 the composition of formula_142 with this sequence converges to formula_171 (continuous in the sequential sense).

While condition 1 always guarantees condition 2, the converse is not necessarily true. The spaces for which the two conditions are equivalent are called sequential spaces. All first-countable spaces, including metric spaces, are sequential spaces, but not all topological spaces are sequential. Nets generalize the notion of a sequence so that condition 2 reads as follows:

With this change, the conditions become equivalent for all maps of topological spaces, including topological spaces that do not necessarily have a countable or linearly ordered neighbourhood basis around a point. Therefore, while sequences do not encode sufficient information about functions between topological spaces, nets do, because collections of open sets in topological spaces are much like directed sets in behavior.

For an example where sequences do not suffice, interpret the set formula_324 of all functions with prototype formula_325 as the Cartesian product formula_326 (by identifying a function formula_142 with the tuple formula_328 and conversely) and endow it with the product topology. This (product) topology on formula_324 is identical to the topology of pointwise convergence. Let formula_330 denote the set of all functions formula_331 that are equal to formula_332 everywhere except for at most finitely many points (that is, such that the set formula_333 is finite). Then the constant formula_334 function formula_335 belongs to the closure of formula_330 in formula_337 that is, formula_338 This will be proven by constructing a net in formula_330 that converges to formula_340 However, there does not exist any in formula_330 that converges to formula_342 which makes this one instance where (non-sequence) nets must be used because sequences alone can not reach the desired conclusion. Compare elements of formula_324 pointwise in the usual way by declaring that formula_344 if and only if formula_345 for all formula_56 This pointwise comparison is a partial order that makes formula_347 a directed set since given any formula_348 their pointwise minimum formula_349 belongs to formula_330 and satisfies formula_351 and formula_352 This partial order turns the identity map formula_353 (defined by formula_354) into an formula_330-valued net. This net converges pointwise to formula_356 in formula_357 which implies that formula_356 belongs to the closure of formula_330 in formula_360

More generally, a subnet of a sequence is necessarily a sequence. Moreso, a subnet of a sequence may be a sequence, but not a subsequence. But, in the specific case of a sequential space, every net induces a corresponding sequence, and this relationship maps subnets to subsequences. Specifically, for a first-countable space, the net formula_280 induces the sequence formula_362 where formula_363 is defined as the formula_364 smallest value in formula_1that is, let formula_366 and let formula_367 for every integer formula_368.

==Examples==

=== Subspace topology ===

If the set formula_369 is endowed with the subspace topology induced on it by formula_114 then formula_131 in formula_12 if and only if formula_131 in formula_124 In this way, the question of whether or not the net formula_29 converges to the given point formula_81 depends on this topological subspace formula_23 consisting of formula_81 and the image of (that is, the points of) the net formula_82

=== Neighborhood systems ===
Intuitively, convergence of a net formula_280 means that the values formula_182 come and stay as close as we want to formula_81 for large enough formula_206 Given a point formula_81 in a topological space, let formula_385 denote the set of all neighbourhoods containing formula_56 Then formula_385 is a directed set, where the direction is given by reverse inclusion, so that formula_388 if and only if formula_23 is contained in formula_390 For formula_391 let formula_392 be a point in formula_124 Then formula_394 is a net. As formula_23 increases with respect to formula_396 the points formula_392 in the net are constrained to lie in decreasing neighbourhoods of formula_32. Therefore, in this neighborhood system of a point formula_81, formula_392 does indeed converge to formula_81 according to the definition of net convergence.

Given a subbase formula_402 for the topology on formula_12 (where note that every base for a topology is also a subbase) and given a point formula_95 a net formula_29 in formula_12 converges to formula_81 if and only if it is eventually in every neighborhood formula_408 of formula_56 This characterization extends to neighborhood subbases (and so also neighborhood bases) of the given point formula_56

===Limits in a Cartesian product===

A net in the product space has a limit if and only if each projection has a limit.

Explicitly, let formula_411 be topological spaces, endow their Cartesian product 
formula_412
with the product topology, and that for every index formula_413 denote the canonical projection to formula_414 by
formula_415

Let formula_416 be a net in formula_417 directed by formula_1 and for every index formula_419 let 
formula_420
denote the result of &quot;plugging formula_421 into formula_422&quot;, which results in the net formula_423 
It is sometimes useful to think of this definition in terms of function composition: the net formula_424 is equal to the composition of the net formula_425 with the projection formula_426 that is, formula_427

For any given point formula_428 the net formula_421 converges to formula_430 in the product space formula_417 if and only if for every index formula_419 formula_433 converges to formula_434 in formula_435 
And whenever the net formula_421 clusters at formula_430 in formula_417 then formula_424 clusters at formula_434 for every index formula_441 However, the converse does not hold in general. For example, suppose formula_442 and let formula_443 denote the sequence formula_444 that alternates between formula_445 and formula_446 Then formula_447 and formula_448 are cluster points of both formula_449 and formula_450 in formula_451 but formula_452 is not a cluster point of formula_421 since the open ball of radius formula_332 centered at formula_455 does not contain even a single point formula_421 

=== Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem and relation to the axiom of choice ===

If no formula_457 is given but for every formula_419 there exists some formula_459 such that formula_460 in formula_461 then the tuple defined by formula_462 will be a limit of formula_421 in formula_212 
However, the axiom of choice might be need to be assumed to conclude that this tuple formula_430 exists; the axiom of choice is not needed in some situations, such as when formula_215 is finite or when every formula_459 is the limit of the net formula_424 (because then there is nothing to choose between), which happens for example, when every formula_461 is a Hausdorff space. If formula_215 is infinite and formula_471 is not empty, then the axiom of choice would (in general) still be needed to conclude that the projections formula_472 are surjective maps.

The axiom of choice is equivalent to Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem, which states that the product of any collection of compact topological spaces is compact. 
But if every compact space is also Hausdorff, then the so called &quot;Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem for compact Hausdorff spaces&quot; can be used instead, which is equivalent to the ultrafilter lemma and so strictly weaker than the axiom of choice. 
Nets can be used to give short proofs of both version of Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem by using the characterization of net convergence given above together with the fact that a space is compact if and only if every net has a convergent subnet.

===Limit superior/inferior===

Limit superior and limit inferior of a net of real numbers can be defined in a similar manner as for sequences. Some authors work even with more general structures than the real line, like complete lattices.

For a net formula_473 put
formula_474

Limit superior of a net of real numbers has many properties analogous to the case of sequences. For example,
formula_475
where equality holds whenever one of the nets is convergent.

===Riemann integral===

The definition of the value of a Riemann integral can be interpreted as a limit of a net of Riemann sums where the net&#x27;s directed set is the set of all partitions of the interval of integration, partially ordered by inclusion.

===Metric spaces===

Suppose formula_476 is a metric space (or a pseudometric space) and formula_477 is endowed with the metric topology. If formula_478 is a point and formula_479 is a net, then formula_480 in formula_476 if and only if formula_482 in formula_483 where formula_484 is a net of real numbers. 
In plain English, this characterization says that a net converges to a point in a metric space if and only if the distance between the net and the point converges to zero. 
If formula_485 is a normed space (or a seminormed space) then formula_480 in formula_485 if and only if formula_488 in formula_489 where formula_490

If formula_476 has at least two points, then we can fix a point formula_492 (such as formula_493 with the Euclidean metric with formula_494 being the origin, for example) and direct the set formula_495 reversely according to distance from formula_496 by declaring that formula_72 if and only if formula_498 In other words, the relation is &quot;has at least the same distance to formula_496 as&quot;, so that &quot;large enough&quot; with respect to this relation means &quot;close enough to formula_496&quot;. 
Given any function with domain formula_501 its restriction to formula_495 can be canonically interpreted as a net directed by formula_503 

A net formula_504 is eventually in a subset formula_23 of a topological space formula_12 if and only if there exists some formula_507 such that for every formula_508 satisfying formula_509 the point formula_510 is in formula_124 
Such a net formula_142 converges in formula_12 to a given point formula_457 if and only if formula_515 in the usual sense (meaning that for every neighborhood formula_99 of formula_303 formula_142 is eventually in formula_99). 

The net formula_504 is frequently in a subset formula_23 of formula_12 if and only if for every formula_507 there exists some formula_508 with formula_525 such that formula_510 is in formula_124
Consequently, a point formula_457 is a cluster point of the net formula_142 if and only if for every neighborhood formula_99 of formula_303 the net is frequently in formula_103

===Function from a well-ordered set to a topological space===

Consider a well-ordered set formula_533 with limit point formula_534 and a function formula_142 from formula_536 to a topological space formula_212 This function is a net on formula_538

It is eventually in a subset formula_99 of formula_12 if there exists an formula_541 such that for every formula_542 the point formula_543 is in formula_103

So formula_545 if and only if for every neighborhood formula_99 of formula_303 formula_142 is eventually in formula_103

The net formula_142 is frequently in a subset formula_99 of formula_12 if and only if for every formula_541 there exists some formula_542 such that formula_555

A point formula_311 is a cluster point of the net formula_142 if and only if for every neighborhood formula_99 of formula_559 the net is frequently in formula_103

The first example is a special case of this with formula_561

<doc id="22171" wikidata="Q19921" url="?curid=22171" title="Nuclear winter">
<text>Nuclear winter is a severe and prolonged global climatic cooling effect that is hypothesized to occur after widespread firestorms following a large-scale nuclear war. The hypothesis is based on the fact that such fires can inject soot into the stratosphere, where it can block some direct sunlight from reaching the surface of the Earth. It is speculated that the resulting cooling would lead to widespread crop failure and famine. When developing computer models of nuclear-winter scenarios, researchers use the conventional bombing of Hamburg, and the Hiroshima firestorm in World War II as example cases where soot might have been injected into the stratosphere, alongside modern observations of natural, large-area wildfire-firestorms.

==General==
&quot;Nuclear winter&quot;, or as it was initially termed, &quot;nuclear twilight&quot;, began to be considered as a scientific concept in the 1980s after it became clear that an earlier hypothesis predicting that fireball generated NOx emissions would devastate the ozone layer was losing credibility. It was within this context that the climatic effects of soot from fires became the new focus of the climatic effects of nuclear war. In these model scenarios, various soot clouds containing uncertain quantities of soot were assumed to form over cities, oil refineries, and more rural missile silos. Once the quantity of soot is decided upon by the researchers, the climate effects of these soot clouds are then modeled. The term &quot;nuclear winter&quot; was a neologism coined in 1983 by Richard P. Turco in reference to a one-dimensional computer model created to examine the &quot;nuclear twilight&quot; idea. This model projected that massive quantities of soot and smoke would remain aloft in the air for on the order of years, causing a severe planet-wide drop in temperature.

After the failure of the predictions on the effects of the 1991 Kuwait oil fires that were made by the primary team of climatologists that advocate the hypothesis, over a decade passed without new published papers on the topic. More recently, the same team of prominent modellers from the 1980s have begun again to publish the outputs of computer models. These newer models produce the same general findings as their old ones, namely that the ignition of 100 firestorms, each comparable in intensity to that observed in Hiroshima in 1945, could produce a &quot;small&quot; nuclear winter. These firestorms would result in the injection of soot (specifically black carbon) into the Earth&#x27;s stratosphere, producing an anti-greenhouse effect that would lower the Earth&#x27;s surface temperature. The severity of this cooling in Alan Robock&#x27;s model suggests that the cumulative products of 100 of these firestorms could cool the global climate by approximately 1 °C (1.8 °F), largely eliminating the magnitude of anthropogenic global warming for the next roughly two or three years. Robock and his collaborators have modeled the effect on global food production, and project that the injection of more than 5 Tg of soot into the stratosphere would lead to mass food shortages persisting for several years. According to their model, livestock and aquatic food production would be unable to compensate for reduced crop output in almost all countries, and adaptation measures such as food waste reduction would have limited impact on increasing available calories.

As nuclear devices need not be detonated to ignite a firestorm, the term &quot;nuclear winter&quot; is something of a misnomer. The majority of papers published on the subject state that without qualitative justification, nuclear explosions are the cause of the modeled firestorm effects. The only phenomenon that is modeled by computer in the nuclear winter papers is the climate forcing agent of firestorm-soot, a product which can be ignited and formed by a myriad of means. Although rarely discussed, the proponents of the hypothesis state that the same &quot;nuclear winter&quot; effect would occur if 100 large scale conventional firestorms were ignited.

A much larger number of firestorms, in the thousands, was the initial assumption of the computer modelers who coined the term in the 1980s. These were speculated to be a possible result of any large scale employment of counter-value airbursting nuclear weapon use during an American-Soviet total war. This larger number of firestorms, which are not in themselves modeled, are presented as causing nuclear winter conditions as a result of the smoke inputted into various climate models, with the depths of severe cooling lasting for as long as a decade. During this period, summer drops in average temperature could be up to 20 °C (36 °F) in core agricultural regions of the US, Europe, and China, and as much as 35 °C (63 °F) in Russia. This cooling would be produced due to a 99% reduction in the natural solar radiation reaching the surface of the planet in the first few years, gradually clearing over the course of several decades.

On the fundamental level, since the advent of photographic evidence of tall clouds were captured, it was known that firestorms could inject soot smoke/aerosols into the stratosphere, but the longevity of this slew of aerosols was a major unknown. Independent of the team that continue to publish theoretical models on nuclear winter, in 2006, Mike Fromm of the Naval Research Laboratory, experimentally found that each natural occurrence of a massive wildfire firestorm, much larger than that observed at Hiroshima, can produce minor &quot;nuclear winter&quot; effects, with short-lived, approximately one month of a nearly immeasurable drop in surface temperatures, confined to the hemisphere that they burned in. This is somewhat analogous to the frequent volcanic eruptions that inject sulfates into the stratosphere and thereby produce minor, even negligible, volcanic winter effects.

A suite of satellite and aircraft-based firestorm-soot-monitoring instruments are at the forefront of attempts to accurately determine the lifespan, quantity, injection height, and optical properties of this smoke. Information regarding all of these properties is necessary to truly ascertain the length and severity of the cooling effect of firestorms, independent of the nuclear winter computer model projections.

Currently, from satellite tracking data, it appears that stratospheric smoke aerosols dissipate in a time span under approximately two months. The existence of a tipping point into a new stratospheric condition where the aerosols would not be removed within this time frame remains to be determined.

== Mechanism ==
The nuclear winter scenario assumes that 100 or more city firestorms are ignited by nuclear explosions, and that the firestorms lift large amounts of sooty smoke into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere by the movement offered by the pyrocumulonimbus clouds that form during a firestorm. At above the Earth&#x27;s surface, the absorption of sunlight could further heat the soot in the smoke, lifting some or all of it into the stratosphere, where the smoke could persist for years if there is no rain to wash it out. This aerosol of particles could heat the stratosphere and prevent a portion of the sun&#x27;s light from reaching the surface, causing surface temperatures to drop drastically. In this scenario it is predicted that surface air temperatures would be the same as, or colder than, a given region&#x27;s winter for months to years on end.

The modeled stable inversion layer of hot soot between the troposphere and high stratosphere that produces the anti-greenhouse effect was dubbed the &quot;Smokeosphere&quot; by Stephen Schneider et al. in their 1988 paper.

Although it is common in the climate models to consider city firestorms, these need not be ignited by nuclear devices; more conventional ignition sources can instead be the spark of the firestorms. Prior to the previously mentioned solar heating effect, the soot&#x27;s injection height is controlled by the rate of energy release from the firestorm&#x27;s fuel, not the size of an initial nuclear explosion. For example, the mushroom cloud from the bomb dropped on Hiroshima reached a height of six kilometers (middle troposphere) within a few minutes and then dissipated due to winds, while the individual fires within the city took almost three hours to form into a firestorm and produce a pyrocumulus cloud, a cloud that is assumed to have reached upper tropospheric heights, as over its multiple hours of burning, the firestorm released an estimated 1000 times the energy of the bomb.

As the incendiary effects of a nuclear explosion do not present any especially characteristic features, it is estimated by those with strategic bombing experience that as the city was a firestorm hazard, the same fire ferocity and building damage produced at Hiroshima by one 16-kiloton nuclear bomb from a single B-29 bomber could have been produced instead by the conventional use of about 1.2 kilotons of incendiary bombs from 220 B-29s distributed over the city.

While the firestorms of Dresden and Hiroshima and the mass fires of Tokyo and Nagasaki occurred within mere months in 1945, the more intense and conventionally lit Hamburg firestorm occurred in 1943. Despite the separation in time, ferocity and area burned, leading modelers of the hypothesis state that these five fires potentially placed five percent as much smoke into the stratosphere as the hypothetical 100 nuclear-ignited fires discussed in modern models. While it is believed that the modeled climate-cooling-effects from the mass of soot injected into the stratosphere by 100 firestorms (one to five million metric tons) would have been detectable with technical instruments in WWII, five percent of that would not have been possible to observe at that time.

=== Aerosol removal timescale ===

The exact timescale for how long this smoke remains, and thus how severely this smoke affects the climate once it reaches the stratosphere, is dependent on both chemical and physical removal processes.

The most important physical removal mechanism is &quot;rainout&quot;, both during the &quot;fire-driven convective column&quot; phase, which produces &quot;black rain&quot; near the fire site, and rainout after the convective plume&#x27;s dispersal, where the smoke is no longer concentrated and thus &quot;wet removal&quot; is believed to be very efficient. However, these efficient removal mechanisms in the troposphere are avoided in the Robock 2007 study, where solar heating is modeled to quickly loft the soot into the stratosphere, &quot;detraining&quot; or separating the darker soot particles from the fire clouds&#x27; whiter water condensation.

Once in the stratosphere, the physical removal mechanisms affecting the timescale of the soot particles&#x27; residence are how quickly the aerosol of soot collides and coagulates with other particles via Brownian motion, and falls out of the atmosphere via gravity-driven dry deposition, and the time it takes for the &quot;phoretic effect&quot; to move coagulated particles to a lower level in the atmosphere. Whether by coagulation or the phoretic effect, once the aerosol of smoke particles are at this lower atmospheric level, cloud seeding can begin, permitting precipitation to wash the smoke aerosol out of the atmosphere by the wet deposition mechanism.

The chemical processes that affect the removal are dependent on the ability of atmospheric chemistry to oxidize the carbonaceous component of the smoke, via reactions with oxidative species such as ozone and nitrogen oxides, both of which are found at all levels of the atmosphere, and which also occur at greater concentrations when air is heated to high temperatures.

Historical data on residence times of aerosols, albeit a different mixture of aerosols, in this case stratospheric sulfur aerosols and volcanic ash from megavolcano eruptions, appear to be in the one-to-two-year time scale, however aerosol–atmosphere interactions are still poorly understood.

=== Soot properties ===

Sooty aerosols can have a wide range of properties, as well as complex shapes, making it difficult to determine their evolving atmospheric optical depth value. The conditions present during the creation of the soot are believed to be considerably important as to their final properties, with soot generated on the more efficient spectrum of burning efficiency considered almost &quot;elemental carbon black,&quot; while on the more inefficient end of the burning spectrum, greater quantities of partially burnt/oxidized fuel are present. These partially burnt &quot;organics&quot; as they are known, often form tar balls and brown carbon during common lower-intensity wildfires, and can also coat the purer black carbon particles. However, as the soot of greatest importance is that which is injected to the highest altitudes by the pyroconvection of the firestorm – a fire being fed with storm-force winds of air – it is estimated that the majority of the soot under these conditions is the more oxidized black carbon.

== Consequences ==
=== Climatic effects ===
A study presented at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in December 2006 found that even a small-scale, regional nuclear war could disrupt the global climate for a decade or more. In a regional nuclear conflict scenario where two opposing nations in the subtropics would each use 50 Hiroshima-sized nuclear weapons (about 15 kilotons each) on major population centers, the researchers estimated as much as five million tons of soot would be released, which would produce a cooling of several degrees over large areas of North America and Eurasia, including most of the grain-growing regions. The cooling would last for years, and, according to the research, could be &quot;catastrophic&quot;, disrupting agricultural production and food gathering in particular in higher latitude countries.

=== Ozone depletion ===
Nuclear detonations produce large amounts of nitrogen oxides by breaking down the air around them. These are then lifted upwards by thermal convection. As they reach the stratosphere, these nitrogen oxides are capable of catalytically breaking down the ozone present in this part of the atmosphere. Ozone depletion would allow a much greater intensity of harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun to reach the ground.

A 2008 study by Michael J. Mills et al., published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that a nuclear weapons exchange between Pakistan and India using their current arsenals could create a near-global ozone hole, triggering human health problems and causing environmental damage for at least a decade. The computer-modeled study looked at a nuclear war between the two countries involving 50 Hiroshima-sized nuclear devices on each side, producing massive urban fires and lofting as much as five million metric tons of soot about into the stratosphere. The soot would absorb enough solar radiation to heat surrounding gases, increasing the breakdown of the stratospheric ozone layer protecting Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation, with up to 70% ozone loss at northern high latitudes.

=== Nuclear summer ===
A &quot;nuclear summer&quot; is a hypothesized scenario in which, after a nuclear winter caused by aerosols inserted into the atmosphere that would prevent sunlight from reaching lower levels or the surface, has abated, a greenhouse effect then occurs due to carbon dioxide released by combustion and methane released from the decay of the organic matter such as corpses that froze during the nuclear winter.

Another more sequential hypothetical scenario, following the settling out of most of the aerosols in 1–3 years, the cooling effect would be overcome by a heating effect from greenhouse warming, which would raise surface temperatures rapidly by many degrees, enough to cause the death of much if not most of the life that had survived the cooling, much of which is more vulnerable to higher-than-normal temperatures than to lower-than-normal temperatures. The nuclear detonations would release CO2 and other greenhouse gases from burning, followed by more released from the decay of dead organic matter. The detonations would also insert nitrogen oxides into the stratosphere that would then deplete the ozone layer around the Earth.

Other more straightforward hypothetical versions exist of the hypothesis that nuclear winter might give way to a nuclear summer. The high temperatures of the nuclear fireballs could destroy the ozone gas of the middle stratosphere.

== History ==
=== Early work ===
In 1952, a few weeks prior to the Ivy Mike (10.4 megaton) bomb test on Elugelab Island, there were concerns that the aerosols lifted by the explosion might cool the Earth. Major Norair Lulejian, USAF, and astronomer Natarajan Visvanathan studied this possibility, reporting their findings in &quot;Effects of Superweapons Upon the Climate of the World&quot;, the distribution of which was tightly controlled. This report is described in a 2013 report by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency as the initial study of the &quot;nuclear winter&quot; concept. It indicated no appreciable chance of explosion-induced climate change.

The implications for civil defense of numerous surface bursts of high yield hydrogen bomb explosions on Pacific Proving Ground islands such as those of Ivy Mike in 1952 and Castle Bravo (15 Mt) in 1954 were described in a 1957 report on &quot;The Effects of Nuclear Weapons&quot;, edited by Samuel Glasstone. A section in that book entitled &quot;Nuclear Bombs and the Weather&quot; states: &quot;The dust raised in severe volcanic eruptions, such as that at Krakatoa in 1883, is known to cause a noticeable reduction in the sunlight reaching the earth ... The amount of [soil or other surface] debris remaining in the atmosphere after the explosion of even the largest nuclear weapons is probably not more than about one percent or so of that raised by the Krakatoa eruption. Further, solar radiation records reveal that none of the nuclear explosions to date has resulted in any detectable change in the direct sunlight recorded on the ground.&quot; The US Weather Bureau in 1956 regarded it as conceivable that a large enough nuclear war with megaton-range surface detonations could lift enough soil to cause a new ice age.

The 1966 RAND corporation memorandum &quot;The Effects of Nuclear War on the Weather and Climate&quot; by E. S. Batten, while primarily analysing potential dust effects from surface bursts, notes that &quot;in addition to the effects of the debris, extensive fires ignited by nuclear detonations might change the surface characteristics of the area and modify local weather patterns ... however, a more thorough knowledge of the atmosphere is necessary to determine their exact nature, extent, and magnitude.&quot;

In the United States National Research Council (NRC) book &quot;Long-Term Worldwide Effects of Multiple Nuclear-Weapons Detonations&quot; published in 1975, it states that a nuclear war involving 4,000 Mt from &quot;present arsenals&quot; would probably deposit much less dust in the stratosphere than the Krakatoa eruption, judging that the effect of dust and oxides of nitrogen would probably be slight climatic cooling which &quot;would probably lie within normal global climatic variability, but the possibility of climatic changes of a more dramatic nature cannot be ruled out&quot;.

In the 1985 report, &quot;The Effects on the Atmosphere of a Major Nuclear Exchange&quot;, the Committee on the Atmospheric Effects of Nuclear Explosions argues that a &quot;plausible&quot; estimate on the amount of stratospheric dust injected following a surface burst of 1 Mt is 0.3 teragrams, of which 8 percent would be in the micrometer range. The potential cooling from soil dust was again looked at in 1992, in a US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report on geoengineering, which estimated that about 1010 kg (10 teragrams) of stratospheric injected soil dust with particulate grain dimensions of 0.1 to 1 micrometer would be required to mitigate the warming from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide, that is, to produce ~2 °C of cooling.

In 1969, Paul Crutzen discovered that oxides of nitrogen (NOx) could be an efficient catalyst for the destruction of the ozone layer/stratospheric ozone. Following studies on the potential effects of NOx generated by engine heat in stratosphere flying Supersonic Transport (SST) airplanes in the 1970s, in 1974, John Hampson suggested in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; that due to the creation of atmospheric NOx by nuclear fireballs, a full-scale nuclear exchange could result in depletion of the ozone shield, possibly subjecting the earth to ultraviolet radiation for a year or more. In 1975, Hampson&#x27;s hypothesis &quot;led directly&quot; to the United States National Research Council (NRC) reporting on the models of ozone depletion following nuclear war in the book &quot;Long-Term Worldwide Effects of Multiple Nuclear-Weapons Detonations&quot;.

In the section of this 1975 NRC book pertaining to the issue of fireball generated NOx and ozone layer loss therefrom, the NRC presented model calculations from the early-to-mid 1970s on the effects of a nuclear war with the use of large numbers of multi-megaton yield detonations, which returned conclusions that this could reduce ozone levels by 50 percent or more in the northern hemisphere.

However, independent of the computer models presented in the 1975 NRC works, a paper in 1973 in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; depicts the stratospheric ozone levels worldwide overlaid upon the number of nuclear detonations during the era of atmospheric testing. The authors conclude that neither the data nor their models show any correlation between the approximate 500 Mt in historical atmospheric testing and an increase or decrease of ozone concentration. In 1976, a study on the experimental measurements of an earlier atmospheric nuclear test as it affected the ozone layer also found that nuclear detonations are exonerated of depleting ozone, after the at first alarming model calculations of the time. Similarly, a 1981 paper found that the models on ozone destruction from one test and the physical measurements taken were in disagreement, as no destruction was observed.

In total, about 500 Mt were atmospherically detonated between 1945 and 1971, peaking in 1961–1962, when 340 Mt were detonated in the atmosphere by the United States and Soviet Union. During this peak, with the multi-megaton range detonations of the two nations nuclear test series, in exclusive examination, a total yield estimated at 300 Mt of energy was released. Due to this, 3 × 1034 additional molecules of nitric oxide (about 5,000 tons per Mt, 5 × 109 grams per megaton) are believed to have entered the stratosphere, and while ozone depletion of 2.2 percent was noted in 1963, the decline had started prior to 1961 and is believed to have been caused by other meteorological effects.

In 1982 journalist Jonathan Schell in his popular and influential book &quot;The Fate of the Earth&quot;, introduced the public to the belief that fireball generated NOx would destroy the ozone layer to such an extent that crops would fail from solar UV radiation and then similarly painted the fate of the Earth, as plant and aquatic life going extinct. In the same year, 1982, Australian physicist Brian Martin, who frequently corresponded with John Hampson who had been greatly responsible for much of the examination of NOx generation, penned a short historical synopsis on the history of interest in the effects of the direct NOx generated by nuclear fireballs, and in doing so, also outlined Hampson&#x27;s other non-mainstream viewpoints, particularly those relating to greater ozone destruction from upper-atmospheric detonations as a result of any widely used anti-ballistic missile (ABM-1 Galosh) system. However, Martin ultimately concludes that it is &quot;unlikely that in the context of a major nuclear war&quot; ozone degradation would be of serious concern. Martin describes views about potential ozone loss and therefore increases in ultraviolet light leading to the widespread destruction of crops, as advocated by Jonathan Schell in &quot;The Fate of the Earth&quot;, as highly unlikely.

More recent accounts on the specific ozone layer destruction potential of NOx species are much less than earlier assumed from simplistic calculations, as &quot;about 1.2 million tons&quot; of natural and generated stratospheric NOx is believed to be formed each year according to Robert P. Parson in the 1990s.

==== Science fiction ====
The first published suggestion that cooling of the climate could be an effect of a nuclear war, appears to have been originally put forth by Poul Anderson and F. N. Waldrop in their story &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Children&quot;, in the March 1947 issue of the &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; magazine. The story, primarily about a team of scientists hunting down mutants, warns of a &quot;Fimbulwinter&quot; caused by dust that blocked sunlight after a recent nuclear war and speculated that it may even trigger a new Ice Age. Anderson went on to publish a novel based partly on this story in 1961, titling it &quot;Twilight World&quot;. Similarly in 1985 it was noted by T. G. Parsons that the story &quot;Torch&quot; by C. Anvil, which also appeared in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; magazine, but in the April 1957 edition, contains the essence of the &quot;Twilight at Noon&quot;/&quot;nuclear winter&quot; hypothesis. In the story, a nuclear warhead ignites an oil field, and the soot produced &quot;screens out part of the sun&#x27;s radiation&quot;, resulting in Arctic temperatures for much of the population of North America and the Soviet Union.

=== 1980s ===
The 1988 Air Force Geophysics Laboratory publication, &quot;An assessment of global atmospheric effects of a major nuclear war&quot; by H. S. Muench, et al., contains a chronology and review of the major reports on the nuclear winter hypothesis from 1983 to 1986. In general, these reports arrive at similar conclusions as they are based on &quot;the same assumptions, the same basic data&quot;, with only minor model-code differences. They skip the modeling steps of assessing the possibility of fire and the initial fire plumes and instead start the modeling process with a &quot;spatially uniform soot cloud&quot; which has found its way into the atmosphere.

Although never openly acknowledged by the multi-disciplinary team who authored the most popular 1980s TTAPS model, in 2011 the American Institute of Physics states that the TTAPS team (named for its participants, who had all previously worked on the phenomenon of dust storms on Mars, or in the area of asteroid impact events: Richard P. Turco, Owen Toon, Thomas P. Ackerman, James B. Pollack and Carl Sagan) announcement of their results in 1983 &quot;was with the explicit aim of promoting international arms control&quot;. However, &quot;the computer models were so simplified, and the data on smoke and other aerosols were still so poor, that the scientists could say nothing for certain&quot;.

In 1981, William J. Moran began discussions and research in the National Research Council (NRC) on the airborne soil/dust effects of a large exchange of nuclear warheads, having seen a possible parallel in the dust effects of a war with that of the asteroid-created K-T boundary and its popular analysis a year earlier by Luis Alvarez in 1980. An NRC study panel on the topic met in December 1981 and April 1982 in preparation for the release of the NRC&#x27;s &quot;The Effects on the Atmosphere of a Major Nuclear Exchange&quot;, published in 1985.

As part of a study on the creation of oxidizing species such as NOx and ozone in the troposphere after a nuclear war, launched in 1980 by &quot;Ambio&quot;, a journal of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Paul J. Crutzen and John W. Birks began preparing for the 1982 publication of a calculation on the effects of nuclear war on stratospheric ozone, using the latest models of the time. However, they found that as a result of the trend towards more numerous but less energetic, sub-megaton range nuclear warheads (made possible by the march to increase ICBM warhead accuracy), the ozone layer danger was &quot;not very significant&quot;.

It was after being confronted with these results that they &quot;chanced&quot; upon the notion, as &quot;an afterthought&quot; of nuclear detonations igniting massive fires everywhere and, crucially, the smoke from these conventional fires then going on to absorb sunlight, causing surface temperatures to plummet. In early 1982, the two circulated a draft paper with the first suggestions of alterations in short-term climate from fires presumed to occur following a nuclear war. Later in the same year, the special issue of &quot;Ambio&quot; devoted to the possible environmental consequences of nuclear war by Crutzen and Birks was titled &quot;The Atmosphere after a Nuclear War: Twilight at Noon&quot;, and largely anticipated the nuclear winter hypothesis. The paper looked into fires and their climatic effect and discussed particulate matter from large fires, nitrogen oxide, ozone depletion and the effect of nuclear twilight on agriculture. Crutzen and Birks&#x27; calculations suggested that smoke particulates injected into the atmosphere by fires in cities, forests and petroleum reserves could prevent up to 99 percent of sunlight from reaching the Earth&#x27;s surface. This darkness, they said, could exist &quot;for as long as the fires burned&quot;, which was assumed to be many weeks, with effects such as: &quot;The normal dynamic and temperature structure of the atmosphere would...change considerably over a large fraction of the Northern Hemisphere, which will probably lead to important changes in land surface temperatures and wind systems.&quot; An implication of their work was that a successful nuclear decapitation strike could have severe climatic consequences for the perpetrator.

After reading a paper by N. P. Bochkov and E. I. Chazov, published in the same edition of &quot;Ambio&quot; that carried Crutzen and Birks&#x27;s paper &quot;Twilight at Noon&quot;, Soviet atmospheric scientist Georgy Golitsyn applied his research on Mars dust storms to soot in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The use of these influential Martian dust storm models in nuclear winter research began in 1971, when the Soviet spacecraft Mars 2 arrived at the red planet and observed a global dust cloud. The orbiting instruments together with the 1971 Mars 3 lander determined that temperatures on the surface of the red planet were considerably colder than temperatures at the top of the dust cloud. Following these observations, Golitsyn received two telegrams from astronomer Carl Sagan, in which Sagan asked Golitsyn to &quot;explore the understanding and assessment of this phenomenon&quot;. Golitsyn recounts that it was around this time that he had &quot;proposed a theory to explain how Martian dust may be formed and how it may reach global proportions.&quot;

In the same year Alexander Ginzburg, an employee in Golitsyn&#x27;s institute, developed a model of dust storms to describe the cooling phenomenon on Mars. Golitsyn felt that his model would be applicable to soot after he read a 1982 Swedish magazine dedicated to the effects of a hypothetical nuclear war between the USSR and the US. Golitsyn would use Ginzburg&#x27;s largely unmodified dust-cloud model with soot assumed as the aerosol in the model instead of soil dust and in an identical fashion to the results returned, when computing dust-cloud cooling in the Martian atmosphere, the cloud high above the planet would be heated while the planet below would cool drastically. Golitsyn presented his intent to publish this Martian-derived Earth-analog model to the Andropov instigated &quot;Committee of Soviet Scientists in Defence of Peace Against the Nuclear Threat&quot; in May 1983, an organization that Golitsyn would later be appointed vice-chairman. The establishment of this committee was done with the expressed approval of the Soviet leadership with the intent &quot;to expand controlled contacts with Western &quot;nuclear freeze&quot; activists&quot;. Having gained this committees approval, in September 1983, Golitsyn published the first computer model on the nascent &quot;nuclear winter&quot; effect in the widely read &quot;Herald of the Russian Academy of Sciences&quot;.

On 31 October 1982, Golitsyn and Ginsburg&#x27;s model and results were presented at the conference on &quot;The World after Nuclear War&quot;, hosted in Washington, D.C.

Both Golitsyn and Sagan had been interested in the cooling on the dust storms on the planet Mars in the years preceding their focus on &quot;nuclear winter&quot;. Sagan had also worked on Project A119 in the 1950s–1960s, in which he attempted to model the movement and longevity of a plume of lunar soil.

After the publication of &quot;Twilight at Noon&quot; in 1982, the TTAPS team have said that they began the process of doing a 1-dimensional computational modeling study of the atmospheric consequences of nuclear war/soot in the stratosphere, though they would not publish a paper in &quot;Science&quot; magazine until late-December 1983. The phrase &quot;nuclear winter&quot; had been coined by Turco just prior to publication. In this early paper, TTAPS used assumption-based estimates on the total smoke and dust emissions that would result from a major nuclear exchange, and with that, began analyzing the subsequent effects on the atmospheric radiation balance and temperature structure as a result of this quantity of assumed smoke. To compute dust and smoke effects, they employed a one-dimensional microphysics/radiative-transfer model of the Earth&#x27;s lower atmosphere (up to the mesopause), which defined only the vertical characteristics of the global climate perturbation.

Interest in the environmental effects of nuclear war, however, had continued in the Soviet Union after Golitsyn&#x27;s September paper, with Vladimir Alexandrov and G. I. Stenchikov also publishing a paper in December 1983 on the climatic consequences, although in contrast to the contemporary TTAPS paper, this paper was based on simulations with a three-dimensional global circulation model. (Two years later Alexandrov disappeared under mysterious circumstances). Richard Turco and Starley L. Thompson were both critical of the Soviet research. Turco called it &quot;primitive&quot; and Thompson said it used obsolete US computer models. Later they were to rescind these criticisms and instead applauded Alexandrov&#x27;s pioneering work, saying that the Soviet model shared the weaknesses of all the others.

In 1984, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) commissioned Golitsyn and N. A. Phillips to review the state of the science. They found that studies generally assumed a scenario where half of the world&#x27;s nuclear weapons would be used, ~5000 Mt, destroying approximately 1,000 cities, and creating large quantities of carbonaceous smoke – 1– being most likely, with a range of 0.2– (NAS; TTAPS assumed ). The smoke resulting would be largely opaque to solar radiation but transparent to infrared, thus cooling the Earth by blocking sunlight, but not creating warming by enhancing the greenhouse effect. The optical depth of the smoke can be much greater than unity. Forest fires resulting from non-urban targets could increase aerosol production further. Dust from near-surface explosions against hardened targets also contributes; each megaton-equivalent explosion could release up to five million tons of dust, but most would quickly fall out; high altitude dust is estimated at 0.1–1 million tons per megaton-equivalent of explosion. Burning of crude oil could also contribute substantially.

The 1-D radiative-convective models used in these studies produced a range of results, with cooling up to 15–42 °C between 14 and 35 days after the war, with a &quot;baseline&quot; of about 20 °C. Somewhat more sophisticated calculations using 3-D GCMs produced similar results: temperature drops of about 20 °C, though with regional variations.

All calculations show large heating (up to 80 °C) at the top of the smoke layer at about ; this implies a substantial modification of the circulation there and the possibility of advection of the cloud into low latitudes and the southern hemisphere.

=== 1990 ===
In a 1990 paper entitled &quot;Climate and Smoke: An Appraisal of Nuclear Winter&quot;, TTAPS gave a more detailed description of the short- and long-term atmospheric effects of a nuclear war using a three-dimensional model:

First one to three months:
* 10–25% of soot injected is immediately removed by precipitation, while the rest is transported over the globe in one to two weeks
* SCOPE figures for July smoke injection:
** 22 °C drop in mid-latitudes
** 10 °C drop in humid climates
** 75% decrease in rainfall in mid-latitudes
** Light level reduction of 0% in low latitudes to 90% in high smoke injection areas
* SCOPE figures for winter smoke injection:
** Temperature drops between 3 and 4 °C

Following one to three years:
* 25–40% of injected smoke is stabilised in atmosphere (NCAR). Smoke stabilised for approximately one year.
* Land temperatures of several degrees below normal
* Ocean surface temperature between 2 and 6 °C
* Ozone depletion of 50% leading to 200% increase in UV radiation incident on surface.

=== Kuwait wells in the first Gulf War ===


One of the major results of TTAPS&#x27; 1990 paper was the re-iteration of the team&#x27;s 1983 model that 100 oil refinery fires would be sufficient to bring about a small scale, but still globally deleterious nuclear winter.

Following Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait and Iraqi threats of igniting the country&#x27;s approximately 800 oil wells, speculation on the cumulative climatic effect of this, presented at the World Climate Conference in Geneva that November in 1990, ranged from a nuclear winter type scenario, to heavy acid rain and even short term immediate global warming.

In articles printed in the &quot;Wilmington Morning Star&quot; and the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; newspapers in January 1991, prominent authors of nuclear winter papers – Richard P. Turco, John W. Birks, Carl Sagan, Alan Robock and Paul Crutzen – collectively stated that they expected catastrophic nuclear winter like effects with continental-sized effects of sub-freezing temperatures as a result of the Iraqis going through with their threats of igniting 300 to 500 pressurized oil wells that could subsequently burn for several months.

As threatened, the wells were set on fire by the retreating Iraqis in March 1991, and the 600 or so burning oil wells were not fully extinguished until November 6, 1991, eight months after the end of the war, and they consumed an estimated six million barrels of oil per day at their peak intensity.

When Operation Desert Storm began in January 1991, coinciding with the first few oil fires being lit, Dr. S. Fred Singer and Carl Sagan discussed the possible environmental effects of the Kuwaiti petroleum fires on the ABC News program &quot;Nightline&quot;. Sagan again argued that some of the effects of the smoke could be similar to the effects of a nuclear winter, with smoke lofting into the stratosphere, beginning around above sea level in Kuwait, resulting in global effects. He also argued that he believed the net effects would be very similar to the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia, which resulted in the year 1816 being known as the &quot;Year Without a Summer&quot;.

Sagan listed modeling outcomes that forecast effects extending to South Asia, and perhaps to the Northern Hemisphere as well. Sagan stressed this outcome was so likely that &quot;It should affect the war plans.&quot; Singer, on the other hand, anticipated that the smoke would go to an altitude of about and then be rained out after about three to five days, thus limiting the lifetime of the smoke. Both height estimates made by Singer and Sagan turned out to be wrong, albeit with Singer&#x27;s narrative being closer to what transpired, with the comparatively minimal atmospheric effects remaining limited to the Persian Gulf region, with smoke plumes, in general, lofting to about and a few as high as .

Sagan and his colleagues expected that a &quot;self-lofting&quot; of the sooty smoke would occur when it absorbed the sun&#x27;s heat radiation, with little to no scavenging occurring, whereby the black particles of soot would be heated by the sun and lifted/lofted higher and higher into the air, thereby injecting the soot into the stratosphere, a position where they argued it would take years for the sun-blocking effect of this aerosol of soot to fall out of the air, and with that, catastrophic ground level cooling and agricultural effects in Asia and possibly the Northern Hemisphere as a whole. In a 1992 follow-up, Peter V. Hobbs and others had observed no appreciable evidence for the nuclear winter team&#x27;s predicted massive &quot;self-lofting&quot; effect and the oil-fire smoke clouds contained less soot than the nuclear winter modelling team had assumed.

The atmospheric scientist tasked with studying the atmospheric effect of the Kuwaiti fires by the National Science Foundation, Peter V. Hobbs, stated that the fires&#x27; modest impact suggested that &quot;some numbers [used to support the Nuclear Winter hypothesis]... were probably a little overblown.&quot;

Hobbs found that at the peak of the fires, the smoke absorbed 75 to 80% of the sun&#x27;s radiation. The particles rose to a maximum of , and when combined with scavenging by clouds the smoke had a short residency time of a maximum of a few days in the atmosphere.

Pre-war claims of wide scale, long-lasting, and significant global environmental effects were thus not borne out, and found to be significantly exaggerated by the media and speculators, with climate models by those not supporting the nuclear winter hypothesis at the time of the fires predicting only more localized effects such as a daytime temperature drop of ~10 °C within 200 km of the source.

Sagan later conceded in his book &quot;The Demon-Haunted World&quot; that his predictions obviously did not turn out to be correct: &quot;it &quot;was&quot; pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped 4–6 °C over the Persian Gulf, but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and Asia was spared.&quot;

The idea of oil well and oil reserve smoke pluming into the stratosphere serving as a main contributor to the soot of a nuclear winter was a central idea of the early climatology papers on the hypothesis; they were considered more of a possible contributor than smoke from cities, as the smoke from oil has a higher ratio of black soot, thus absorbing more sunlight. Hobbs compared the papers&#x27; assumed &quot;emission factor&quot; or soot generating efficiency from ignited oil pools and found, upon comparing to measured values from oil pools at Kuwait, which were the greatest soot producers, the emissions of soot assumed in the nuclear winter calculations were still &quot;too high&quot;. Following the results of the Kuwaiti oil fires being in disagreement with the core nuclear winter promoting scientists, 1990s nuclear winter papers generally attempted to distance themselves from suggesting oil well and reserve smoke will reach the stratosphere.

In 2007, a nuclear winter study noted that modern computer models have been applied to the Kuwait oil fires, finding that individual smoke plumes are not able to loft smoke into the stratosphere, but that smoke from fires covering a large area like some forest fires can lift smoke into the stratosphere, and recent evidence suggests that this occurs far more often than previously thought. The study also suggested that the burning of the comparably smaller cities, which would be expected to follow a nuclear strike, would also loft significant amounts of smoke into the stratosphere:

However, the above simulation notably contained the assumption that no dry or wet deposition would occur.

== Recent modeling ==
Between 1990 and 2003, commentators noted that no peer-reviewed papers on &quot;nuclear winter&quot; were published.

Based on new work published in 2007 and 2008 by some of the authors of the original studies, several new hypotheses have been put forth, primarily the assessment that as few as 100 firestorms would result in a nuclear winter. However, far from the hypothesis being &quot;new&quot;, it drew the same conclusion as earlier 1980s models, which similarly regarded 100 or so city firestorms as a threat.

Compared to climate change for the past millennium, even the smallest exchange modeled would plunge the planet into temperatures colder than the Little Ice Age (the period of history between approximately 1600 and 1850 AD). This would take effect instantly, and agriculture would be severely threatened. Larger amounts of smoke would produce larger climate changes, making agriculture impossible for years. In both cases, new climate model simulations show that the effects would last for more than a decade.

=== 2007 study on global nuclear war ===
A study published in the &quot;Journal of Geophysical Research&quot; in July 2007, titled &quot;Nuclear winter revisited with a modern climate model and current nuclear arsenals: Still catastrophic consequences&quot;, used current climate models to look at the consequences of a global nuclear war involving most or all of the world&#x27;s current nuclear arsenals (which the authors judged to be one similar to the size of the world&#x27;s arsenals twenty years earlier). The authors used a global circulation model, ModelE from the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which they noted &quot;has been tested extensively in global warming experiments and to examine the effects of volcanic eruptions on climate&quot;. The model was used to investigate the effects of a war involving the entire current global nuclear arsenal, projected to release about 150 Tg of smoke into the atmosphere, as well as a war involving about one third of the current nuclear arsenal, projected to release about 50 Tg of smoke. In the 150 Tg case they found that:

In addition, they found that this cooling caused a weakening of the global hydrological cycle, reducing global precipitation by about 45%. As for the 50 Tg case involving one third of current nuclear arsenals, they said that the simulation &quot;produced climate responses very similar to those for the 150 Tg case, but with about half the amplitude,&quot; but that &quot;the time scale of response is about the same&quot;. They did not discuss the implications for agriculture in depth, but noted that a 1986 study which assumed no food production for a year projected that &quot;most of the people on the planet would run out of food and starve to death by then&quot; and commented that their own results show that, &quot;This period of no food production needs to be extended by many years, making the impacts of nuclear winter even worse than previously thought.&quot;

=== 2014 ===
In 2014, Michael J. Mills (at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research, NCAR), et al., published &quot;Multi-decadal global cooling and unprecedented ozone loss following a regional nuclear conflict&quot; in the journal &quot;Earth&#x27;s Future&quot;. The authors used computational models developed by NCAR to simulate the climatic effects of a soot cloud that they suggest would be a result of a regional nuclear war in which 100 &quot;small&quot; (15 Kt) weapons are detonated over cities. The model had outputs, due to the interaction of the soot cloud:

...global ozone losses of 20–50% over populated areas, levels unprecedented in human history, would accompany the coldest average surface temperatures in the last 1000 years. We calculate summer enhancements in UV indices of 30–80% over Mid-Latitudes, suggesting widespread damage to human health, agriculture, and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Killing frosts would reduce growing seasons by 10–40 days per year for 5 years. Surface temperatures would be reduced for more than 25 years, due to thermal inertia and albedo effects in the ocean and expanded sea ice. The combined cooling and enhanced UV would put significant pressures on global food supplies and could trigger a global nuclear famine.

=== 2018 ===
Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory published the results of a multi-scale study of the climate impact of a regional nuclear exchange, the same scenario considered by Robock et al. and by Toon et al. in 2007. Unlike previous studies, this study simulated the processes whereby black carbon would be lofted into the atmosphere and found that very little would be lofted into the stratosphere and, as a result, the long-term climate impacts were much lower than those studies had concluded. In particular, &quot;none of the simulations produced a nuclear winter effect&quot;, and &quot;the probability of significant global cooling from a limited exchange scenario as envisioned in previous studies is highly unlikely&quot;. This study has been contradicted by results in several subsequent studies claiming the 2018 study to be flawed.

Research published in the peer-reviewed journal &quot;Safety&quot; suggested that no nation should possess more than 100 nuclear warheads because of the blowback effect on the aggressor nation&#x27;s own population because of &quot;nuclear autumn&quot;.

=== 2019 ===
2019 saw the publication of two studies on nuclear winter that build on previous modeling and describe new scenarios of nuclear winter from smaller exchanges of nuclear weapons than have been previously simulated.

As in the 2007 study by Robock &quot;et al.&quot;, a 2019 study by Coupe &quot;et al.&quot; models a scenario in which 150 Tg of black carbon is released into the atmosphere following an exchange of nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia where both countries use all of the nuclear weapons treaties permit them to. This amount of black carbon far exceeds that which has been emitted in the atmosphere by all volcanic eruptions in the past 1,200 years but is less than the asteroid impact which caused a mass extinction event 66 million years ago. Coupe &quot;et al.&quot; used the &quot;whole atmosphere community climate model version 4&quot; (WACCM4), which has a higher resolution and is more effective at simulating aerosols and stratospheric chemistry than the ModelE simulation used by Robock &quot;et al&quot;.

The WACCM4 model simulates that black carbon molecules increase to ten times their normal size when they reach the stratosphere. ModelE did not account for this effect. This difference in black carbon particle size results in a greater optical depth in the WACCM4 model across the world for the first two years after the initial injection due to greater absorption of sunlight in the stratosphere. This will have the effect of increasing stratospheric temperatures by 100K and result in ozone depletion that is slightly greater than ModelE predicted. Another consequence of the larger particle size is accelerating the rate at which black carbon molecules fall out of the atmosphere; after ten years from the injection of black carbon into the atmosphere, WACCM4 predicts 2 Tg will remain, while ModelE predicted 19 Tg.

The 2019 model and the 2007 model both predict significant temperature decreases across the globe, however the increased resolution and particle simulation in 2019 predict a greater temperature anomaly in the first six years after injection but a faster return to normal temperatures. Between a few months after the injection to the sixth year of anomaly, the WACCM4 predicts cooler global temperatures than ModelE, with temperatures more than 20K below normal leading to freezing temperatures during the summer months over much of the northern hemisphere leading to a 90% reduction in agricultural growing seasons in the midlatitudes, including the midwestern United States. WACCM4 simulations also predict a 58% reduction in global annual precipitation from normal levels in years three and four after injection, a 10% higher reduction than predicted in ModelE.

Toon &quot;et al.&quot; simulated a nuclear scenario in 2025 where India and Pakistan engage in a nuclear exchange in which 100 urban areas in Pakistan and 150 urban areas in India are attacked with nuclear weapons ranging from 15 kt to 100 kt and examined the effects of black carbon released into the atmosphere from airburst-only detonations. The researchers modeled the atmospheric effects if all weapons were 15 kt, 50 kt, and 100 kt, providing a range where a nuclear exchange would likely fall into given the recent nuclear tests performed by both nations. The ranges provided are large because neither India nor Pakistan is obligated to provide information on their nuclear arsenals, so their extent remains largely unknown.

Toon &quot;et al.&quot; assume that either a firestorm or conflagration will occur after each detonation of the weapons, and the amount of black carbon inserted into the atmosphere from the two outcomes will be equivalent and of a profound extent; in Hiroshima in 1945, it is predicted that the firestorm released 1,000 times more energy than was released during the nuclear explosion. Such a large area being burned would release large amounts of black carbon into the atmosphere. The amount released ranges from 16.1 Tg if all weapons were 15 kt or less to 36.6 Tg for all 100 kt weapons. For the 15 kt and 100kt range of weapons, the researchers modeled global precipitation reductions of 15% to 30%, temperature reductions between 4K and 8K, and ocean temperature decreases of 1K to 3K. If all weapons used were 50 kt or more, Hadley cell circulation would be disrupted and cause a 50% decrease in precipitation in the American midwest. Net primary productivity (NPP) for oceans decreases from 10% to 20% for the 15 kt and 100 kt scenarios, respectively, while land NPP decreases between 15% and 30%; particularly affected are midlatitude agricultural regions in the United States and Europe, experiencing 25-50% reductions in NPP. As predicted by other literature, once the black carbon is removed from the atmosphere after ten years, temperatures and NPP will return to normal.

=== 2021 ===
Coupe et al. report the simulation of a El Niño effect lasting several years after six nuclear scenarios ranging from 5 to 150 Tg soot under the CESM-WACCM4 model. They term the change a &quot;Nuclear Niño&quot; and describe various changes in the ocean currents.

=== 2022 ===

According to a peer-reviewed study published in the journal &quot;Nature Food&quot; in August 2022, a full-scale nuclear war between the United States and Russia, which together hold more than 90% of the world&#x27;s nuclear weapons, would kill 360 million people directly and more than 5 billion indirectly by starvation during a nuclear winter.

Another paper published that year, from the Tohoku University Earth science scholar Kunio Kaiho, compared the impact of nuclear winter scenarios on marine and terrestrial animal life with that of historical extinction events. Kaiho estimated that a &quot;minor&quot; nuclear war (which he defined as a nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan or an event of equivalent magnitude) would cause extinctions of 10–20% of species on its own, while a &quot;major&quot; nuclear war (defined as a nuclear exchange between United States and Russia) would cause the extinctions of 40–50% of animal species, which is comparable to some of the &quot;Big Five&quot; mass extinction events. For comparison, what he considered the most likely scenario of anthropogenic climate change, with of warming by 2100 and by 2500, would send around 12–14% of animal species extinct under the same methodology.

=== 2023 ===
Since 2023, the U.S. National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine has established an Independent Study on Potential Environmental Effects of Nuclear War. The aim is to evaluate all research on nuclear winter, and the final report will be issued in 2024.

==Criticism and debate==
The five major and largely independent underpinnings that the nuclear winter concept has and continues to receive criticism over are regarded as:

* Would cities readily firestorm, and if so how much soot would be generated?
* &quot;Atmospheric&quot; longevity: would the quantities of soot assumed in the models remain in the atmosphere for as long as projected or would far more soot precipitate as black rain much sooner?
* &quot;Timing&quot; of events: how reasonable is it for the modeling of firestorms or war to commence in late spring or summer (this is done in almost all US-Soviet nuclear winter papers, thereby giving rise to the largest possible degree of modeled cooling)?
* &quot;Darkness and opacity&quot;: how much light-blocking effect the assumed quality of the soot reaching the atmosphere would have?
* &quot;Lofting&quot;: how much soot would be lofted into the stratosphere?

While the highly popularized initial 1983 TTAPS 1-dimensional model forecasts were widely reported and criticized in the media, in part because every later model predicts far less of its &quot;apocalyptic&quot; level of cooling, most models continue to suggest that some deleterious global cooling would still result, under the assumption that a large number of fires occurred in the spring or summer. Starley L. Thompson&#x27;s less primitive mid-1980s 3-dimensional model, which notably contained the very same general assumptions, led him to coin the term &quot;nuclear autumn&quot; to more accurately describe the climate results of the soot in this model, in an on camera interview in which he dismisses the earlier &quot;apocalyptic&quot; models.

A major criticism of the assumptions that continue to make these model results possible appeared in the 1987 book &quot;Nuclear War Survival Skills&quot; (&quot;NWSS&quot;), a civil defense manual by Cresson Kearny for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. According to the 1988 publication &quot;An assessment of global atmospheric effects of a major nuclear war&quot;, Kearny&#x27;s criticisms were directed at the excessive amount of soot that the modelers assumed would reach the stratosphere. Kearny cited a Soviet study that modern cities would not burn as firestorms, as most flammable city items would be buried under non-combustible rubble and that the TTAPS study included a massive overestimate on the size and extent of non-urban wildfires that would result from a nuclear war. The TTAPS authors responded that, amongst other things, they did not believe target planners would intentionally blast cities into rubble, but instead argued fires would begin in relatively undamaged suburbs when nearby sites were hit, and partially conceded his point about non-urban wildfires. Dr. Richard D. Small, director of thermal sciences at the Pacific-Sierra Research Corporation similarly disagreed strongly with the model assumptions, in particular the 1990 update by TTAPS that argues that some 5,075 Tg of material would burn in a total US-Soviet nuclear war, as analysis by Small of blueprints and real buildings returned a maximum of 1,475 Tg of material that could be burned, &quot;assuming that all the available combustible material was actually ignited&quot;.

Although Kearny was of the opinion that future more accurate models would, &quot;indicate there will be even smaller reductions in temperature&quot;, including future potential models that did not so readily accept that firestorms would occur as dependably as nuclear winter modellers assume, in &quot;NWSS&quot; Kearny summarized the comparatively moderate cooling estimate of no more than a few days, from the 1986 &quot;Nuclear Winter Reappraised&quot; model by Starley Thompson and Stephen Schneider. This was done in an effort to convey to his readers that contrary to the popular opinion at the time, in the conclusion of these two climate scientists, &quot;on scientific grounds the global apocalyptic conclusions of the initial nuclear winter hypothesis can now be relegated to a vanishing low level of probability&quot;.

However, a 1988 article by Brian Martin in &quot;Science and Public Policy&quot; states that—although &quot;Nuclear Winter Reappraised&quot; concluded the US-Soviet &quot;nuclear winter&quot; would be much less severe than originally thought, with the authors describing the effects more as a &quot;nuclear autumn&quot;—other statements by Thompson and Schneider show that they, &quot;resisted the interpretation that this means a rejection of the basic points made about nuclear winter&quot;. In the Alan Robock et al. 2007 paper, they write that, &quot;because of the use of the term &#x27;nuclear autumn&#x27; by Thompson and Schneider [1986], even though the authors made clear that the climatic consequences would be large, in policy circles the theory of nuclear winter is considered by some to have been exaggerated and disproved [e.g., Martin, 1988].&quot; In 2007 Schneider expressed his tentative support for the cooling results of the limited nuclear war (Pakistan and India) analyzed in the 2006 model, saying, &quot;The sun is much stronger in the tropics than it is in mid-latitudes. Therefore, a much more limited war [there] could have a much larger effect, because you are putting the smoke in the worst possible place&quot;, and &quot;anything that you can do to discourage people from thinking that there is any way to win anything with a nuclear exchange is a good idea&quot;.

The contribution of smoke from the ignition of live non-desert vegetation, living forests, grasses and so on, nearby to many missile silos is a source of smoke originally assumed to be very large in the initial &quot;Twilight at Noon&quot; paper, and also found in the popular TTAPS publication. However, this assumption was examined by Bush and Small in 1987 and they found that the burning of live vegetation could only conceivably contribute very slightly to the estimated total &quot;nonurban smoke production&quot;. With the vegetation&#x27;s potential to sustain burning only probable if it is within a radius or two from the surface of the nuclear fireball, which is at a distance that would also experience extreme blast winds that would influence any such fires. This reduction in the estimate of the non-urban smoke hazard is supported by the earlier preliminary &quot;Estimating Nuclear Forest Fires&quot; publication of 1984, and by the 1950–1960s in-field examination of surface-scorched, mangled but never burnt-down tropical forests on the surrounding islands from the shot points in the Operation Castle and Operation Redwing test series.


A paper by the United States Department of Homeland Security, finalized in 2010, states that after a nuclear detonation targeting a city &quot;If fires are able to grow and coalesce, a firestorm could develop that would be beyond the abilities of firefighters to control. However experts suggest in the nature of modern US city design and construction may make a raging firestorm unlikely&quot;. The nuclear bombing of Nagasaki for example, did not produce a firestorm. This was similarly noted as early as 1986–1988, when the assumed quantity of fuel &quot;mass loading&quot; (the amount of fuel per square meter) in cities underpinning the winter models was found to be too high and intentionally creates heat fluxes that loft smoke into the lower stratosphere, yet assessments &quot;more characteristic of conditions&quot; to be found in real-world modern cities, had found that the fuel loading, and hence the heat flux that would result from efficient burning, would rarely loft smoke much higher than 4 km.

Russell Seitz, Associate of the Harvard University Center for International Affairs, argues that the winter models&#x27; assumptions give results which the researchers want to achieve and is a case of &quot;worst-case analysis run amok&quot;. In September 1986, Seitz published &quot;Siberian fire as &#x27;nuclear winter&#x27; guide&quot; in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, in which he investigated the 1915 Siberian fire, which started in the early summer months and was caused by the worst drought in the region&#x27;s recorded history. The fire ultimately devastated the region, burning the world&#x27;s largest boreal forest, the size of Germany. While approximately 8˚C of daytime summer cooling occurred under the smoke clouds during the weeks of burning, no increase in potentially devastating agricultural night frosts occurred. Following his investigation into the Siberian fire of 1915, Seitz criticized the &quot;nuclear winter&quot; model results for being based on successive worst-case events:

Seitz cited Carl Sagan, adding an emphasis: &quot;&quot;In almost any realistic case&quot; involving nuclear exchanges between the superpowers, global environmental changes sufficient to cause an extinction event equal to or more severe than that of the close of the Cretaceous when the dinosaurs and many other species died out are likely.&quot; Seitz comments: &quot;The ominous rhetoric italicized in this passage puts even the 100 megaton [the original 100 city firestorm] scenario ... on a par with the 100 million megaton blast of an asteroid striking the Earth. This [is] astronomical mega-hype ...&quot; Seitz concludes:

Seitz&#x27;s opposition caused the proponents of nuclear winter to issue responses in the media. The proponents believed it was simply necessary to show only the possibility of climatic catastrophe, often a worst-case scenario, while opponents insisted that to be taken seriously, nuclear winter should be shown as likely under &quot;reasonable&quot; scenarios. One of these areas of contention, as elucidated by Lynn R. Anspaugh, is upon the question of which season should be used as the backdrop for the US-USSR war models. Most models choose the summer in the Northern Hemisphere as the start point to produce the maximum soot lofting and therefore eventual winter effect. However, it has been pointed out that if the same number of firestorms occurred in the autumn or winter months, when there is much less intense sunlight to loft soot into a stable region of the stratosphere, the magnitude of the cooling effect would be negligible, according to a January model run by Covey et al. Schneider conceded the issue in 1990, saying &quot;a war in late fall or winter would have no appreciable [cooling] effect&quot;.

Anspaugh also expressed frustration that although a managed forest fire in Canada on 3 August 1985 is said to have been lit by proponents of nuclear winter, with the fire potentially serving as an opportunity to do some basic measurements of the optical properties of the smoke and smoke-to-fuel ratio, which would have helped refine the estimates of these critical model inputs, the proponents did not indicate that any such measurements were made. Peter V. Hobbs, who would later successfully attain funding to fly into and sample the smoke clouds from the Kuwait oil fires in 1991, also expressed frustration that he was denied funding to sample the Canadian, and other forest fires in this way. Turco wrote a 10-page memorandum with information derived from his notes and some satellite images, claiming that the smoke plume reached 6 km in altitude.

In 1986, atmospheric scientist Joyce Penner from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory published an article in &quot;Nature&quot; in which she focused on the specific variables of the smoke&#x27;s optical properties and the quantity of smoke remaining airborne after the city fires. She found that the published estimates of these variables varied so widely that depending on which estimates were chosen the climate effect could be negligible, minor or massive. The assumed optical properties for black carbon in more recent nuclear winter papers in 2006 are still &quot;based on those assumed in earlier nuclear winter simulations&quot;.

John Maddox, editor of the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, issued a series of skeptical comments about nuclear winter studies during his tenure. Similarly S. Fred Singer was a long term vocal critic of the hypothesis in the journal and in televised debates with Carl Sagan.

===Critical response to the more modern papers===
In a 2011 response to the more modern papers on the hypothesis, Russell Seitz published a comment in &quot;Nature&quot; challenging Alan Robock&#x27;s claim that there has been no real scientific debate about the &quot;nuclear winter&quot; concept. In 1986 Seitz also contends that many others are reluctant to speak out for fear of being stigmatized as &quot;closet Dr. Strangeloves&quot;; physicist Freeman Dyson of Princeton for example stated &quot;It&#x27;s an absolutely atrocious piece of science, but I quite despair of setting the public record straight.&quot; According to the Rocky Mountain News, Stephen Schneider had been called a fascist by some disarmament supporters for having written his 1986 article &quot;Nuclear Winter Reappraised.&quot; MIT meteorologist Kerry Emanuel similarly wrote in a review in &quot;Nature&quot; that the winter concept is &quot;notorious for its lack of scientific integrity&quot; due to the unrealistic estimates selected for the quantity of fuel likely to burn, the imprecise global circulation models used. Emanuel ends by stating that the evidence of other models point to substantial scavenging of the smoke by rain. Emanuel also made an &quot;interesting point&quot; about questioning proponents&#x27; objectivity when it came to strong emotional or political views that they hold.

William R. Cotton, Professor of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University, specialist in cloud physics modeling and co-creator of the highly influential and previously mentioned RAMS atmosphere model, had in the 1980s worked on soot rain-out models and supported the predictions made by his own and other nuclear winter models. However, he has since reversed this position, according to a book co-authored by him in 2007, stating that, amongst other systematically examined assumptions, far more rain out/wet deposition of soot will occur than is assumed in modern papers on the subject: &quot;We must wait for a new generation of GCMs to be implemented to examine potential consequences quantitatively&quot;. He also reveals that, in his view, &quot;nuclear winter was largely politically motivated from the beginning&quot;.

== Policy implications ==
During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Fidel Castro and Che Guevara called on the USSR to launch a nuclear first strike against the US in the event of a US invasion of Cuba. In the 1980s, Castro was pressuring the Kremlin to adopt a harder line against the US under President Ronald Reagan, even arguing for the potential use of nuclear weapons. As a direct result of this, a Soviet official was dispatched to Cuba in 1985 with an entourage of &quot;experts&quot;, who detailed the ecological effect on Cuba in the event of nuclear strikes on the United States. Soon after, the Soviet official recounts, Castro lost his prior &quot;nuclear fever&quot;. In 2010, Alan Robock was summoned to Cuba to help Castro promote his new view that nuclear war would bring about Armageddon. Robock&#x27;s 90 minute lecture was later aired on the nationwide state-controlled television station in the country.

However, according to Robock, insofar as getting US government attention and affecting nuclear policy, he has failed. In 2009, together with Owen Toon, he gave a talk to the United States Congress, but nothing transpired from it and the then-presidential science adviser, John Holdren, did not respond to their requests in 2009 or at the time of writing in 2011.
In a 2012 &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; feature, Robock and Toon, who had routinely mixed their disarmament advocacy into the conclusions of their &quot;nuclear winter&quot; papers, argue in the political realm that the hypothetical effects of nuclear winter necessitates that the doctrine they assume is active in Russia and US, &quot;mutually assured destruction&quot; (MAD), should instead be replaced with their own &quot;self-assured destruction&quot; (SAD) concept, because, regardless of whose cities burned, the effects of the resultant nuclear winter that they advocate would be, in their view, catastrophic. In a similar vein, in 1989 Carl Sagan and Richard Turco wrote a policy implications paper that appeared in &quot;Ambio&quot; that suggested that as nuclear winter is a &quot;well-established prospect&quot;, both superpowers should jointly reduce their nuclear arsenals to &quot;Canonical Deterrent Force&quot; levels of 100–300 individual warheads each, such that in &quot;the event of nuclear war [this] would minimize the likelihood of [extreme] nuclear winter.&quot;

An originally classified 1984 US interagency intelligence assessment states that in both the preceding 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet and US military were already following the &quot;existing trends&quot; in warhead miniaturization, of higher accuracy and lower yield nuclear warheads. This is seen when assessing the most numerous physics packages in the US arsenal, which in the 1960s were the B28 and W31, however, both quickly became less prominent with the 1970s mass production runs of the 50 Kt W68, the 100 Kt W76 and in the 1980s, with the B61. This trend towards miniaturization, enabled by advances in inertial guidance and accurate GPS navigation etc., was motivated by a multitude of factors, namely the desire to leverage the physics of equivalent megatonnage that miniaturization offered; of freeing up space to fit more MIRV warheads and decoys on each missile. Alongside the desire to still destroy hardened targets but while reducing the severity of fallout collateral damage depositing on neighboring, and potentially friendly, countries. As it relates to the likelihood of nuclear winter, the range of potential thermal radiation ignited fires was already reduced with miniaturization. For example, the most popular nuclear winter paper, the 1983 TTAPS paper, had described a 3000 Mt counterforce attack on ICBM sites with each individual warhead having approximately one Mt of energy; however not long after publication, Michael Altfeld of Michigan State University and political scientist Stephen Cimbala of Pennsylvania State University argued that the then already developed and deployed smaller, more accurate warheads (e.g. W76), together with lower detonation heights, could produce the same counterforce strike with a total of only 3 Mt of energy being expended. They continue that, &quot;if&quot; the nuclear winter models prove to be representative of reality, then far less climatic-cooling would occur, even if firestorm prone areas existed in the target list, as lower fusing heights such as surface bursts would also limit the range of the burning thermal rays due to terrain masking and shadows cast by buildings, while also temporarily lofting far more localized fallout when compared to airburst fuzing – the standard mode of employment against un-hardened targets. This logic is similarly reflected in the originally classified 1984 &quot;Interagency Intelligence assessment&quot;, which suggests that targeting planners would simply have to consider target combustibility along with yield, height of burst, timing and other factors to reduce the amount of smoke to safeguard against the potentiality of a nuclear winter. Therefore, as a consequence of attempting to limit the target fire hazard by reducing the range of thermal radiation with fuzing for surface and sub-surface bursts, this will result in a scenario where the far more concentrated, and therefore deadlier, &quot;local&quot; fallout that is generated following a surface burst forms, as opposed to the comparatively dilute &quot;global&quot; fallout created when nuclear weapons are fuzed in air burst mode.

Altfeld and Cimbala also argued that belief in the possibility of nuclear winter would actually make nuclear war more likely, contrary to the views of Sagan and others, because it would serve yet further motivation to follow the &quot;existing trends&quot;, towards the development of more accurate, and even lower explosive yield, nuclear weapons. As the winter hypothesis suggests that the replacement of the then Cold War viewed strategic nuclear weapons in the multi-megaton yield range, with weapons of explosive yields closer to tactical nuclear weapons, such as the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP), would safeguard against the nuclear winter potential. With the latter capabilities of the then, largely still conceptual RNEP, specifically cited by the influential nuclear warfare analyst Albert Wohlstetter. Tactical nuclear weapons, on the low end of the scale have yields that overlap with large conventional weapons and are therefore often viewed &quot;as blurring the distinction between conventional and nuclear weapons&quot;, making the prospect of using them &quot;easier&quot; in a conflict.

===Alleged Soviet exploitation===

In an interview in 2000 with Mikhail Gorbachev (the leader of the Soviet Union from 1985 to 1991), the following statement was posed to him: &quot;In the 1980s, you warned about the unprecedented dangers of nuclear weapons and took very daring steps to reverse the arms race&quot;, with Gorbachev replying &quot;Models made by Russian and American scientists showed that a nuclear war would result in a nuclear winter that would be extremely destructive to all life on Earth; the knowledge of that was a great stimulus to us, to people of honor and morality, to act in that situation.&quot;

However, a 1984 US Interagency Intelligence Assessment expresses a far more skeptical and cautious approach, stating that the hypothesis is not scientifically convincing. The report predicted that Soviet nuclear policy would be to maintain their strategic nuclear posture, such as their fielding of the high throw-weight SS-18 missile and they would merely attempt to exploit the hypothesis for propaganda purposes, such as directing scrutiny on the US portion of the nuclear arms race. Moreover, it goes on to express the belief that if Soviet officials did begin to take nuclear winter seriously, it would probably make them demand exceptionally high standards of scientific proof for the hypothesis, as the implications of it would undermine their military doctrine – a level of scientific proof which perhaps could not be met without field experimentation. The un-redacted portion of the document ends with the suggestion that substantial increases in Soviet Civil defense food stockpiles might be an early indicator that Nuclear Winter was beginning to influence Soviet upper thinking.

In 1985, &quot;Time&quot; magazine noted &quot;the suspicions of some Western scientists that the nuclear winter hypothesis was promoted by Moscow to give anti-nuclear groups in the U.S. and Europe some fresh ammunition against America&#x27;s arms buildup.&quot; In 1985, the United States Senate met to discuss the science and politics of nuclear winter. During the congressional hearing, the influential analyst Leon Gouré presented evidence that perhaps the Soviets have simply echoed Western reports rather than producing unique findings. Gouré hypothesized that Soviet research and discussions of nuclear war may serve only Soviet political agendas, rather than to reflect actual opinions of Soviet leadership.

In 1986, the Defense Nuclear Agency document &quot;An update of Soviet research on and exploitation of Nuclear winter 1984–1986&quot; charted the minimal [public domain] research contribution on, and Soviet propaganda usage of, the nuclear winter phenomenon.

There is some doubt as to when the Soviet Union began modelling fires and the atmospheric effects of nuclear war. Former Soviet intelligence officer Sergei Tretyakov claimed that, under the directions of Yuri Andropov, the KGB invented the concept of &quot;nuclear winter&quot; in order to stop the deployment of NATO Pershing II missiles. They are said to have distributed to peace groups, the environmental movement and the journal &quot;Ambio&quot; disinformation based on a faked &quot;doomsday report&quot; by the Soviet Academy of Sciences by Georgii Golitsyn, Nikita Moiseyev and Vladimir Alexandrov concerning the climatic effects of nuclear war. Although it is accepted that the Soviet Union exploited the nuclear winter hypothesis for propaganda purposes, Tretyakov&#x27;s inherent claim that the KGB funnelled disinformation to &quot;Ambio&quot;, the journal in which Paul Crutzen and John Birks published the 1982 paper &quot;Twilight at Noon&quot;, has not been corroborated . In an interview in 2009 conducted by the National Security Archive, Vitalii Nikolaevich Tsygichko (a Senior Analyst at the Soviet Academy of Sciences and military mathematical modeler) stated that Soviet military analysts were discussing the idea of &quot;nuclear winter&quot; years before U.S. scientists, although they did not use that exact term.

== Mitigation techniques ==

A number of solutions have been proposed to mitigate the potential harm of a nuclear winter if one appears inevitable. The problem has been attacked at both ends; some solutions focus on preventing the growth of fires and therefore limiting the amount of smoke that reaches the stratosphere in the first place, and others focus on food production with reduced sunlight, with the assumption that the very worst-case analysis results of the nuclear winter models prove accurate and no other mitigation strategies are fielded.

=== Fire control ===
In a report from 1967, techniques included various methods of applying liquid nitrogen, dry ice, and water to nuclear-caused fires. The report considered attempting to stop the spread of fires by creating firebreaks by blasting combustible material out of an area, possibly even using nuclear weapons, along with the use of preventative Hazard Reduction Burns. According to the report, one of the most promising techniques investigated was initiation of rain from seeding of mass-fire thunderheads and other clouds passing over the developing, and then stable, firestorm.

=== Producing food without sunlight ===

In the book &quot;Feeding Everyone No Matter What&quot;, under the worst-case scenario predictions of nuclear winter, the authors present various unconventional food possibilities. These include natural-gas-digesting bacteria, the most well known being &quot;Methylococcus capsulatus&quot;, that is presently used as a feed in fish farming; bark bread, a long-standing famine food using the edible inner bark of trees, and part of Scandinavian history during the Little Ice Age; increased fungiculture or mushrooms such as the honey fungi that grow directly on moist wood without sunlight; and variations of wood or cellulosic biofuel production, which typically already creates edible sugars/xylitol from inedible cellulose, as an intermediate product before the final step of alcohol generation. One of the book&#x27;s authors, mechanical engineer David Denkenberger, states that mushrooms could theoretically feed everyone for three years. Seaweed, like mushrooms, can also grow in low-light conditions. Dandelions and tree needles could provide Vitamin C, and bacteria could provide Vitamin E. More conventional cold-weather crops such as potatoes might get sufficient sunlight at the equator to remain feasible.

=== Large-scale food stockpiling ===
To feed portions of civilization through a nuclear winter, large stockpiles of food storage prior to the event would have to be accomplished. Such stockpiles should be placed underground, at higher elevations and near the equator to mitigate high altitude UV and radioactive isotopes. Stockpiles should also be placed near populations most likely to survive the initial catastrophe. One consideration is who would sponsor the stockpiling. &quot;There may be a mismatch between those most able to sponsor the stockpiles (i.e., the pre-catastrophe wealthy) and those most able to use the stockpiles (the pre-catastrophe rural poor).&quot; The minimum annual global wheat storage is approximately 2 months.

== Climate engineering ==

Despite the name &quot;nuclear winter&quot;, nuclear events are not necessary to produce the modeled climatic effect. In an effort to find a quick and cheap solution to the global warming projection of at least 2 ˚C of surface warming as a result of the doubling in CO2 levels within the atmosphere, through solar radiation management (a form of climate engineering) the underlying nuclear winter effect has been looked at as perhaps holding potential. Besides the more common suggestion to inject sulfur compounds into the stratosphere to approximate the effects of a volcanic winter, the injection of other chemical species such as the release of a particular type of soot particle to create minor &quot;nuclear winter&quot; conditions, has been proposed by Paul Crutzen and others. According to the threshold &quot;nuclear winter&quot; computer models, if one to five teragrams of firestorm-generated soot is injected into the low stratosphere, it is modeled, through the anti-greenhouse effect, to heat the stratosphere but cool the lower troposphere and produce 1.25 °C cooling for two to three years; and after 10 years, average global temperatures would still be 0.5 °C lower than before the soot injection.

== Potential climatic precedents ==
Similar climatic effects to &quot;nuclear winter&quot; followed historical supervolcano eruptions, which plumed sulfate aerosols high into the stratosphere, with this being known as a volcanic winter. The effects of smoke in the atmosphere (short wave absorption) are sometimes termed an &quot;antigreenhouse&quot; effect, and a strong analog is the hazy atmosphere of Titan. Pollack, Toon and others were involved in developing models of Titan&#x27;s climate in the late 1980s, at the same time as their early nuclear winter studies.

Similarly, extinction-level comet and asteroid impacts are also believed to have generated impact winters by the pulverization of massive amounts of fine rock dust. This pulverized rock can also produce &quot;volcanic winter&quot; effects, if sulfate-bearing rock is hit in the impact and lofted high into the air, and &quot;nuclear winter&quot; effects, with the heat of the heavier rock ejecta igniting regional and possibly even global forest firestorms.

This global &quot;impact firestorms&quot; hypothesis, initially supported by Wendy Wolbach, H. Jay Melosh and Owen Toon, suggests that as a result of massive impact events, the small sand-grain-sized ejecta fragments created can meteorically re-enter the atmosphere forming a hot blanket of global debris high in the air, potentially turning the entire sky red-hot for minutes to hours, and with that, burning the complete global inventory of above-ground carbonaceous material, including rain forests. This hypothesis is suggested as a means to explain the severity of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, as the earth impact of an asteroid about 10 km wide which precipitated the extinction is not regarded as sufficiently energetic to have caused the level of extinction from the initial impact&#x27;s energy release alone.

The global firestorm winter, however, has been questioned in more recent years (2003–2013) by Claire Belcher, Tamara Goldin and Melosh, who had initially supported the hypothesis, with this re-evaluation being dubbed the &quot;Cretaceous-Palaeogene firestorm debate&quot; by Belcher.

The issues raised by these scientists in the debate are the perceived low quantity of soot in the sediment beside the fine-grained iridium-rich asteroid dust layer, if the quantity of re-entering ejecta was perfectly global in blanketing the atmosphere, and if so, the duration and profile of the re-entry heating, whether it was a high thermal pulse of heat or the more prolonged and therefore more incendiary &quot;oven&quot; heating, and finally, how much the &quot;self-shielding effect&quot; from the first wave of now-cooled meteors in dark flight contributed to diminishing the total heat experienced on the ground from later waves of meteors.

In part due to the Cretaceous period being a high-atmospheric-oxygen era, with concentrations above that of the present day, Owen Toon et al. in 2013 were critical of the re-evaluations the hypothesis is undergoing.

It is difficult to successfully ascertain the percentage contribution of the soot in this period&#x27;s geological sediment record from living plants and fossil fuels present at the time, in much the same manner that the fraction of the material ignited directly by the meteor impact is difficult to determine.

Odes are elaborately structured poems praising or glorifying an event or individual, describing nature intellectually as well as emotionally. A classic ode is structured in three major parts: the &quot;strophe&quot;, the &quot;antistrophe&quot;, and the &quot;epode&quot;. Different forms such as the &quot;homostrophic ode&quot; and the &quot;irregular ode&quot; also enter.

Greek odes were originally poetic pieces performed with musical accompaniment. As time passed on, they gradually became known as personal lyrical compositions whether sung (with or without musical instruments) or merely recited (always with accompaniment). The primary instruments used were the aulos and the lyre (the latter was the most revered instrument to the ancient Greeks).

There are three typical forms of odes: the Pindaric, Horatian, and irregular. Pindaric odes follow the form and style of Pindar. Horatian odes follow conventions of Horace; the odes of Horace deliberately imitated the Greek lyricists such as Alcaeus and Anacreon. Irregular odes use rhyme, but not the three-part form of the Pindaric ode, nor the two- or four-line stanza of the Horatian ode. The ode is a lyric poem. It conveys exalted and inspired emotions. It is a lyric in an elaborate form, expressed in a language that is imaginative, dignified and sincere.

== Structure ==
=== Pindaric Odes ===
Pindaric odes, also called Greek odes, follow the form and style of the Ancient Greek poet Pindar. These employ a tripartite structure, consisting of the &quot;strophe&quot;, the &quot;antistrophe&quot;, and the &quot;epode&quot;.

In Ancient Greece, odes would have been performed on a stage to musical accompaniment. The chorus (or performers of the ode) would deliver the strophe from one side of the stage, then move to the opposite side to deliver the antistrophe, and finally to centerstage for the epode.

This is reflected the three-part nature of the ode: the strophe sets up a theme, the antistrophe balances it with a contrary perspective, and the epode summarises.

Pindaric odes do not follow strict metrical conventions, meaning they are often irregular in their rhyme and line length. However, the strophe and antistrophe are typically identical in structure, with the epode varying the form.

William Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1807) and Thomas Gray&#x27;s &quot;The Progress of Poesy:&quot; &quot;A Pindaric Ode&quot; (1757) are both written in the Pindaric style. 

Gray&#x27;s &quot;The Bard: A Pindaric Ode&quot; (1757) is a Pindaric ode where the three-part structure is thrice repeated, yielding a longer poem of nine stanzas.

=== Horatian Odes ===
Horatian odes, sometimes called homostrophic odes, follow the conventions of the Roman poet Horace. Unlike the Pindaric ode, the Horatian ode is made up of any number of stanzas (usually quatrains) which all follow the same rhyme scheme and metre. 

In contrast with the very formal panegyric style of many of Pindar&#x27;s odes, Horatian odes often tackle more intimate subjects, such as love and friendship, and were not written for public performance.

Some of the most renowned Horatian odes were written by English Romantic poet John Keats, most famously &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; (1819).

=== Irregular Odes ===
Irregular odes further break down the ode&#x27;s formal conventions. They are sometimes called Cowleyan odes after the English Enlightenment poet Abraham Cowley, who revived the form in England with his publication of fifteen &quot;Pindarique Odes&quot; in 1656. Though this title derives from Pindar, it is a misunderstanding of the Pindaric ode on Cowley&#x27;s part. In fact, Cowley&#x27;s odes are very different from the strictly formal Pindaric ode.

In Cowley&#x27;s poetry, the ode follows an iambic metre, but employs no regular rhyme or line length.

The &#x27;pindarique&#x27; was employed by John Milton in the chorus of his lyrical tragedy, Samson Agonistes (1670/71). However, he corrects Cowley&#x27;s misunderstanding of the form as Pindaric in his &#x27;Preface&#x27;:

: &quot;The measure of verse used in the chorus is of all sorts, called by the Greeks &#x27;monostrophic&#x27;, or rather &#x27;apolelymenon&#x27;, without regard had to strophe, antistrophe or epode, which were a kind of stanzas framed only for the music, then used with the chorus that sung; not essential to the poem and therefore not material; or, being divided into stanzas or pauses, they may be called &#x27;alloeostropha&#x27;.&quot;

==English ode==

The lyrics can be on various themes. The earliest odes in the English language, using the word in its strict form, were the &quot;Epithalamium&quot; and &quot;Prothalamium&quot; of Edmund Spenser.

In the 17th century, the original odes in English were by Abraham Cowley. These were iambic, but had irregular line length patterns and rhyme schemes. Cowley based the principle of his &quot;Pindariques&quot; on an apparent misunderstanding of Pindar&#x27;s metrical practice but, nonetheless, others widely imitated his style, with notable success by John Dryden.

With Pindar&#x27;s metre being better understood in the 18th century, the fashion for Pindaric odes faded, though there are notable actual Pindaric odes by Thomas Gray, &quot;The Progress of Poesy&quot; and &quot;The Bard&quot;.

Around 1800, William Wordsworth revived Cowley&#x27;s Pindaric for one of his finest poems, the &quot;&quot; ode:

&lt;poem&gt;
There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,
The earth, and every common sight,
To me did seem
Apparelled in celestial light,
The glory and the freshness of a dream.
It is not now as it hath been of yore;—
Turn wheresoe&#x27;er I may,
By night or day,
The things which I have seen I now can see no more...
Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
The Soul that rises with us, our life&#x27;s Star,
Hath had elsewhere its setting,
And cometh from afar:
Not in entire forgetfulness,
And not in utter nakedness,
But trailing clouds of glory do we come
From God, who is our home...
&lt;/poem&gt;

Others also wrote odes: Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, and Percy Bysshe Shelley who wrote odes with regular stanza patterns. Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Ode to the West Wind&quot;, written in fourteen line terza rima stanzas, is a major poem in the form. Perhaps the greatest odes of the 19th century, however, were Keats&#x27;s &quot;Five Great Odes of 1819&quot;, which included &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot;, &quot;Ode on Melancholy&quot;, &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;, &quot;Ode to Psyche&quot;, and &quot;To Autumn&quot;. After Keats, there have been comparatively few major odes in English. One major exception is the fourth verse of the poem &quot;For the Fallen&quot; by Laurence Binyon, which is often known as &quot;The Ode to the Fallen&quot;, or simply as &quot;The Ode&quot;.

W.H. Auden also wrote &quot;Ode&quot;, one of the most popular poems from his earlier career when he lived in London, in opposition to people&#x27;s ignorance over the reality of war. In an interview, Auden once stated that he had intended to title the poem &quot;My Silver Age&quot; in mockery of England&#x27;s supposed imperial golden age, however chose &quot;Ode&quot; as it seemed to provide a more sensitive exploration of warfare.

&quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;, while an ekphrasis, also functions as an ode to the artistic beauty the narrator observes. The English ode&#x27;s most common rhyme scheme is ABABCDECDE.
Centuries were occasionally set to music. Composers such as Purcell, Händel and Boyce all set English odes to music.

<doc id="22189" wikidata="Q1123019" url="?curid=22189" title="Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens">
<text>The Temple of Olympian Zeus (, ), also known as the Olympieion or Columns of the Olympian Zeus, is a colossal temple in the centre of Athens, now in ruins. It was dedicated to &quot;Olympian&quot; Zeus, a name originating from his position as head of the Olympian gods. Construction began in the 6th century BC during the rule of the Athenian tyrants, who envisioned building the greatest temple in the ancient world, but it was not completed until the reign of Roman Emperor Hadrian in the 2nd century AD, some 638 years after the project had begun. During the Roman period, the temple, which included 104 colossal columns, was renowned as the largest temple in Greece and housed one of the largest cult statues in the ancient world.

The temple&#x27;s glory was short-lived, as it fell into disuse after being pillaged during a barbarian invasion in 267 AD, just about a century after its completion. It was probably never repaired and was reduced to ruins thereafter. In the centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire, it was extensively quarried for building materials to supply building projects elsewhere in the city. However a substantial part of the temple remains today, notably 16 of the original gigantic columns, and is now the center of a historical precinct.

==History==
===Classical and Hellenistic periods===
The temple is about south-east of the Acropolis, and about south of the center of Athens, Syntagma Square. Its foundations were laid on the site of an ancient outdoor sanctuary dedicated to Zeus. An earlier temple had stood there, constructed by the tyrant Peisistratus around 550 BC. The building was demolished after the death of Peisistratus and the construction of a colossal new Temple of Olympian Zeus was begun around 520 BC by his sons, Hippias and Hipparchos. They sought to surpass two famous contemporary temples, the Heraion of Samos and the second Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. Designed by the architects Antistates, Callaeschrus, Antimachides and Phormos, the Temple of Olympian Zeus was intended to be built of local limestone in the Doric style on a colossal platform measuring by . It was to be flanked by a double colonnade of eight columns across the front and back and twenty-one on the flanks, surrounding the cella.

The work was abandoned when the tyranny was overthrown and Hippias was expelled in 510 BC. Only the platform and some elements of the columns had been completed by that point, and the temple remained in that state for 336 years. The temple was left unfinished during the years of Athenian democracy, apparently because the Greeks thought it was hubris to build on such a scale. In his treatise &quot;Politics&quot;, Aristotle cited the temple as an example of how tyrannies engaged the populace in great works for the state (like a white elephant) and left them no time, energy or means to rebel.

It was not until 174 BC that the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who presented himself as the earthly embodiment of Zeus, revived the project and placed the Roman architect Decimus Cossutius in charge. The design was changed to have three rows of eight columns across the front and back of the temple and a double row of twenty on the flanks, for a total of 104 columns. The columns would stand high and in diameter. The building material was changed to the expensive but high-quality Pentelic marble and the order was changed from Doric to Corinthian, marking the first time that this order had been used on the exterior of a major temple. However, the project ground to a halt again in 164 BC with the death of Antiochus. The temple was still only half-finished by that stage.

Serious damage was inflicted on the partly built temple by Lucius Cornelius Sulla&#x27;s sack of Athens in 86 BC. While looting the city, Sulla seized some of the incomplete columns and transported them to Rome, where they were re-used in the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. A half-hearted attempt was made to complete the temple during Augustus&#x27; reign as the first Roman emperor, but it was not until the accession of Hadrian in the 2nd century AD that the project was finally completed, around 638 years after it had begun.

===Roman era===
In 124–125 AD, when the Philhellene Hadrian visited Athens, a massive building programme was begun that included the completion of the Temple of Olympian Zeus. A walled marble-paved precinct was constructed around the temple, making it a central focus of the ancient city. Cossutius&#x27; design was used with few changes and the temple was formally dedicated by Hadrian in 132, who took the title of &quot;Panhellenios&quot; in commemoration of the occasion. The temple and the surrounding precinct were adorned with numerous statues depicting Hadrian, the gods, and personifications of the Roman provinces. A colossal statue of Hadrian was raised behind the building by the people of Athens in honor of the emperor&#x27;s generosity. An equally colossal chryselephantine statue of Zeus occupied the cella of the temple. The statue&#x27;s form of construction was unusual, as the use of chryselephantine was by this time regarded as archaic. Hadrian may have been imitating Phidias&#x27; famous statue of Athena Parthenos in the Parthenon, seeking to draw attention to the temple and himself by doing so.

Pausanias describes the temple as it was in the 2nd century:
:Before the entrance to the sanctuary of Zeus Olympios [in Athens] – Hadrian the Roman emperor dedicated the temple and the statue, one worth seeing, which in size exceeds all other statues save the colossi at Rhodes and Rome, and is made of ivory and gold with an artistic skill which is remarkable when the size is taken into account – before the entrance, I say, stand statues of Hadrian, two of Thasian stone, two of Egyptian. Before the pillars stand bronze statues which the Athenians call ‘colonies.’ The whole circumference of the precincts is about four states, and they are full of statues; for every city has dedicated a likeness of the emperor Hadrian, and the Athenians have surpassed them in dedicating, behind the temple, the remarkable colossus. Within the precincts are antiquities: a bronze Zeus, a temple of Kronos and Rhea and an enclosure of Gaia (Earth) surnamed Olympias. Here the floor opens to the width of a cubit, and they say that along this bed flowed off the water after the deluge that occurred in the time of [the mythical king] Deukalion, and into it, they cast every year wheat meal mixed with honey. On a pillar is a statue of Isokrates . . . There are also statues in Phrygian marble of Persians supporting a bronze tripod; both the figures and the tripod are worth seeing. The ancient sanctuary of Zeus Olympios the Athenians say was built by Deukalion, and they cite as evidence that Deukalion lived at Athens a grave which is not far from the present temple. Hadrian constructed other buildings also for the Athenians: a temple of Hera and Zeus Panellenios (Common to all Greeks).

The temple was badly damaged during the sack of Athens by the Heruli in 267 AD. It is unlikely to have been repaired, given the extent of the damage to the rest of the city and was completely destroyed by an earthquake in the 5th century. Material from the ruined building was incorporated into a basilica constructed nearby during the 5th or 6th century.

===Medieval and modern periods===

Over the following centuries, the temple was systematically quarried to provide building materials and material for the houses and churches of medieval Athens. By the end of the Byzantine period, it had been almost totally destroyed; when Ciriaco de&#x27; Pizzicolli (Cyriacus of Ancona) visited Athens in 1436 he found only 21 of the original 104 columns still standing.

The fate of one of the columns is recorded by a Greek inscription on one of the surviving columns, which states that &quot;on 27 April 1759 he pulled down the column&quot;. This refers to the Turkish governor of Athens, Mustapha Agha Tzistarakis, who is recorded by a chronicler as having &quot;destroyed one of Hadrian&#x27;s columns with gunpowder&quot; in order to re-use the marble to make plaster for the Tzistarakis Mosque that he was building in the Monastiraki district of the city. During the Ottoman period the temple was known to the Greeks as the Palace of Hadrian, while the Turks called it the Palace of Belkis, from a Turkish legend that the temple had been the residence of Solomon&#x27;s wife.

Fifteen columns remain standing today and a sixteenth column lies on the ground where it fell during a storm in 1852. Nothing remains of the cella or the great statue that it once housed.
==Excavation==
The temple was excavated in 1889–1896 by Francis Penrose of the British School in Athens (who also played a leading role in the restoration of the Parthenon), in 1922 by the German archaeologist Gabriel Welter and in the 1960s by Greek archaeologists led by Ioannes Travlos. The temple, along with the surrounding ruins of other ancient structures, is a historical precinct administered by Ephorate of Antiquities of the Greek Interior Ministry.

==Present==
Today, the temple is an open-air museum, part of the unification of the archaeological sites of Athens. As a historical site it is protected and supervised by the Ephorate of Antiquities.

===Mythodea 2001===
On 28 June 2001, Vangelis organized the Mythodea Chorus at the Temple of Olympian Zeus in the context of NASA&#x27;s Mars mission. Sopranos Jessye Norman and Kathleen Battle participated in the concert which was covered by 20 television networks from America, Australia, Canada, Japan and European countries, under the direction of Irish filmmaker Declan Lowney. The chorus arrangement brought thousands of people inside the Olympic venues, and outside the temple, into the empty streets of Athens. Joining Norman and Battle were the London Metropolitan Orchestra and the Greek National Opera, as well as over a hundred people dressed in ancient Greek clothing. The screen mounted at the Olympia connected visual images of ancient Greek performances — vases, frescoes and statues — that invested music with images of the planet Mars.

===Ellinais 2007===
On 21 January 2007, a group of Greek pagans held a ceremony honoring Zeus on the grounds of the temple. The event was organized by Ellinais, an organization which won a court battle to obtain recognition for Ancient Greek religious practices in the fall of 2006.
