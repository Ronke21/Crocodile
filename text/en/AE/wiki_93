<text>Plymouth ( ) is a port city and unitary authority in Devon, South West England. It is located on Devon&#x27;s south coast between the rivers Plym and Tamar, about southwest of Exeter and southwest of London. It is the most populous city in Devon.

Plymouth&#x27;s history extends back to the Bronze Age, evolving from a trading post at Mount Batten into the thriving market town of Sutton, which was formally re-named as Plymouth in 1439 when it was made a borough. The settlement has played a significant role in English history, notably in 1588 when an English fleet based here defeated the Spanish Armada, and in 1620 as the departure point for the Pilgrim Fathers to the New World. During the English Civil War, the town was held by the Parliamentarians and was besieged between 1642 and 1646. In 1690 a dockyard was established on the River Tamar for the Royal Navy and Plymouth grew as a commercial shipping port throughout the Industrial Revolution.

After absorbing nearby settlements in 1914, the borough was awarded city status in 1928. During World War II, Plymouth suffered extensive damage in the Plymouth Blitz, leading to post-war rebuilding that significantly shaped its modern appearance. A further expansion of its boundaries in 1967 contributed to its current status as the 30th-most populous built-up area in the UK and the second-largest city in the South West after Bristol, with a population in of .

Plymouth&#x27;s economy, historically rooted in shipbuilding and seafaring, has transitioned towards a service-based economy since the 1990s. It maintains strong maritime connections, hosting HMNB Devonport, the largest operational naval base in Western Europe, and offering ferry links to Brittany and Spain. The city is also home to the University of Plymouth, reflecting its educational and cultural significance. Today, the city is governed locally by Plymouth City Council and is represented nationally by three Members of Parliament.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

Upper Palaeolithic deposits, including bones of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; have been found in local caves, and artefacts dating from the Bronze Age to the Middle Iron Age have been found at Mount Batten, showing that it was one of few principal trading ports of pre-Roman Britannia dominating continental trade with Armorica. An unidentified settlement named &quot;TAMARI OSTIA&quot; (mouth/estuaries of the Tamar) is listed in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geographia&quot; and is presumed to be located in the area of the modern city. An ancient promontory fort was located at Rame Head at the mouth of Plymouth Sound with ancient hillforts located at Lyneham Warren to the east, Boringdon Camp and Maristow Camp to the north.

The settlement of Plympton, further up the River Plym than the current Plymouth, was also an early trading port. (See Plympton for the derivation of the name &quot;Plym&quot;.) As the river silted up in the early 11th century, mariners and merchants were forced to settle downriver, at the current day Barbican near the river mouth. At the time this village was called Sutton, meaning &quot;south town&quot; in Old English. The name &quot;Plym Mouth&quot;, meaning &quot;mouth of the River Plym&quot; was first mentioned in a Pipe Roll of 1211. Plympton Priory owned land at Sutton and secured a charter from Henry III in 1254 granting the priory the right to hold a weekly market and annual fair at Sutton, making it a market town.

=== Early defence and Renaissance ===

During the Hundred Years&#x27; War a French attack in 1340 burned a manor house and took some prisoners, but failed to get into the town. In 1403 the town was burned by Breton raiders. On 12 November 1439 the market town of Sutton was incorporated as a borough and formally renamed Plymouth, with a subsequent charter the following year formalising its boundaries. It was the first time a borough charter had been issued by parliament rather than directly from the monarch.

In the late fifteenth century, Plymouth Castle, a &quot;castle quadrate&quot;, was constructed close to the area now known as The Barbican; it included four round towers, one at each corner, as featured on the city coat of arms.

The castle served to protect Sutton Pool, which is where the fleet was based in Plymouth prior to the establishment of Plymouth Dockyard. In 1512, an Act of Parliament was passed to further fortify Plymouth. The work included defensive walls at the entrance to Sutton Pool (across which a chain was extended in times of danger). Defences on St Nicholas Island also date from this time, and a string of six artillery blockhouses were built, including one on Fishers Nose at the south-eastern corner of the Hoe. This location was further strengthened by the building of a fort (later known as Drake&#x27;s Fort) in 1596; it was the site of the Citadel, established in the 1660s (see below).
During the 16th century, locally produced wool was the major export commodity. Plymouth was the home port for successful maritime traders, among them Sir John Hawkins, who led England&#x27;s first foray into the Atlantic slave trade, as well as Sir Francis Drake, Mayor of Plymouth in 1581–2. Crews for the first English failed settlement attempt at Roanoke Colony in North America departed in 1587 under Sir Walter Raleigh&#x27;s and Drake&#x27;s leadership; returning bearing maize, tobacco and potatoes.
In 1588, according to legend, Drake insisted on completing his game of bowls on the Hoe before engaging the Spanish Armada. In 1620 the Pilgrims set sail for the New World from Plymouth, establishing Plymouth Colony – the second English colony in what is now the United States. In 1625, the town Mayor estimated that African slavers captured that summer about 1,000 villagers from the area, to be sold in Africa.

During the English Civil War Plymouth sided with the Parliamentarians and was besieged for almost four years by the Royalists. The last major attack by the Royalists was by Sir Richard Grenville leading thousands of soldiers towards Plymouth, but they were defeated by the Plymothians at Freedom Fields Park. The civil war ended as a Parliamentary win, but monarchy was restored by King Charles II in 1660, who imprisoned many of the Parliamentary heroes on Drake&#x27;s Island. Construction of the Royal Citadel began in 1665, after the Restoration; it was armed with cannon facing both out to sea and into the town, rumoured to be a reminder to residents not to oppose the Crown. Mount Batten tower also dates from around this time.

=== Plymouth Dock, naval power and Foulston ===

Throughout the 17th century, Plymouth had gradually lost its pre-eminence as a trading port. By the mid-17th century, commodities manufactured elsewhere in England cost too much to transport to Plymouth, and the city had no means of processing sugar or tobacco imports, major products from the colonies. Local sailors turning to piracy such as Henry Every became infamous, celebrated in the London play The Successful Pyrate. It played a part in the Atlantic slave trade during the early 18th century, although it was relatively small.

In the nearby parish of Stoke Damerel the first dockyard, HMNB Devonport, opened in 1690 on the eastern bank of the River Tamar. Further docks were built here in 1727, 1762 and 1793. The settlement that developed here was called &quot;Dock&quot; or &quot;Plymouth Dock&quot; at the time, and a new town, separate from Plymouth, grew up. In 1712 there were 318 men employed and by 1733 the population had grown to 3,000 people.

Before the latter half of the 18th century, grain, timber and then coal were Plymouth&#x27;s main imports. During this time the real source of wealth was from the neighbouring town of Plymouth Dock (renamed in 1824 to Devonport) and the major employer in the entire region was the dockyard. The &quot;Three Towns&quot; conurbation of Plymouth, Stonehouse and Devonport enjoyed some prosperity during the late 18th and early 19th century and were enriched by a series of neo-classical urban developments designed by London architect John Foulston. Foulston was important for both Devonport and Plymouth and was responsible for several grand public buildings, many now destroyed, including the Athenaeum, the Theatre Royal and Royal Hotel, and much of Union Street.

Local chemist William Cookworthy established his short-lived Plymouth Porcelain venture in 1768 to exploit the deposits of china clay that he had discovered in Cornwall. He was acquainted with engineer John Smeaton, the builder of the third Eddystone Lighthouse.
The Breakwater in Plymouth Sound was designed by John Rennie to protect the fleet moving in and out of Devonport; work started in 1812. Numerous technical difficulties and repeated storm damage meant that it was not completed until 1841, twenty years after Rennie&#x27;s death. In the 1860s, a ring of Palmerston forts was constructed around the outskirts of Devonport, to protect the dockyard from attack from any direction.

Some of the most significant imports to Plymouth from the Americas and Europe during the latter half of the 19th century included maize, wheat, barley, sugar cane, guano, sodium nitrate and phosphate. Aside from the dockyard in the town of Devonport, industries in Plymouth such as the gasworks, the railways and tramways, and a number of small chemical works had begun to develop in the 19th century, continuing into the 20th century.

=== &quot;Plan for Plymouth&quot; 1943 ===
During the First World War, Plymouth was the port of entry for many troops from around the Empire. It was developed as a facility for the manufacture of munitions. Although major units of the Royal Navy moved to the safety of Scapa Flow, Devonport was an important base for escort vessels and repairs. Flying boats operated from Mount Batten.

During the Second World War, Devonport was the headquarters of Western Approaches Command until 1941, and Sunderland flying boats were operated by the Royal Australian Air Force. It was an important embarkation point for US troops for D-Day. The city was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe, in a series of 59 raids known as the Plymouth Blitz. Although the dockyards were the principal targets, much of the city centre and over 3,700 houses were completely destroyed and more than 1,000 civilians lost their lives. This was largely due to Plymouth&#x27;s status as a major port. Charles Church was hit by incendiary bombs and partially destroyed in 1941 during the Blitz, but has not been demolished. It has been designated as an official permanent monument to the bombing of Plymouth during World War II.

The redevelopment of the city was planned by Sir Patrick Abercrombie in his 1943 &quot;Plan for Plymouth&quot; whilst simultaneously working on the reconstruction plan for London. This initially included plans to expand the city into south east Cornwall, but these were abandoned after opposition from Cornwall County Council. Between 1951 and 1957 over 1000 homes were completed every year, mostly using innovative prefabricated systems of just three main types.

The &quot;Plan for Plymouth&quot; was, on the one hand, a template for the rapid reassembly of a destroyed city centre, but Abercrombie also took the opportunity to lay out a whole hierarchy of settlements across the city of communities, neighbourhoods and districts. Central to this was a revision of transport infrastructure that prioritised the position of the railway as a gateway to the city centre and provided in the long-term for a dual carriageway road by-pass that only finally came into being in the 1980s (forty years after being planned). The plan is the subject of Jill Craigie&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Way We Live&quot; (1946).

By 1964 over 20,000 new homes had been built, transforming the dense overcrowded and unsanitary slums of the pre-war city into a low density, dispersed suburbia. Most of the city centre shops had been destroyed and those that remained were cleared to enable a zoned reconstruction according to his plan. In 1962 the modernist high rise of the Civic Centre was constructed, an architecturally significant example of mid-twentieth century civic slab-and-tower set piece. The Plymouth City Council allowed it to fall into disrepair but it was grade II listed in 2007 by English Heritage to prevent its demolition.

Post-war, Devonport Dockyard was kept busy refitting aircraft carriers such as the and, later, nuclear submarines. New light industrial factories were constructed in the newly zoned industrial sector, attracting rapid growth of the urban population. The army had substantially left the city by 1971, after barracks were pulled down in the 1960s, but the city remains home to 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery and also 42 Commando of the Royal Marines.

==Governance==
As a unitary authority there is only one tier of local government covering Plymouth. Plymouth City Council meets at the Council House on Armada Way in the city centre. There are no civil parishes in the city, which is an unparished area. The city forms part of the ceremonial county of Devon for the purposes of lieutenancy, but has been administratively independent from Devon County Council since it became a unitary authority in 1998.

===Administrative history===
The first record of the existence of a settlement at Plymouth was in the Domesday Book in 1086 as &quot;Sudtone&quot; (Sutton), Saxon for south farm, located at the present-day Barbican. From Saxon times, it was in the hundred of Roborough. Sutton became a market town in 1254 and a borough in 1439, when it was formally renamed Plymouth.

Plymouth was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836, governed by a corporate body officially called the &quot;mayor, aldermen and burgesses of the borough of Plymouth&quot;, but generally known as the corporation or town council. When elected county councils were established in 1889, both Plymouth and neighbouring Devonport were considered large enough to provide their own county-level services and so they were made county boroughs, independent from Devon County Council. In 1914 the county boroughs of Plymouth and Devonport and the adjoining urban district of East Stonehouse were merged to form a single county borough of Plymouth. Collectively they were referred to as &quot;The Three Towns&quot;.

Plymouth was granted city status on 18 October 1928. Between 1439 and 1935, Plymouth had a mayor. In 1935 the city was given the right to appoint a Lord Mayor. The city&#x27;s boundaries further expanded in 1967 to include the town of Plympton and the parish of Plymstock.

The 1971 Local Government White Paper proposed abolishing county boroughs, which would have left Plymouth, a town of 250,000 people, being administered from a council based at the smaller Exeter, on the other side of the county. This led to Plymouth lobbying for the creation of a Tamarside county, to include Plymouth, Torpoint, Saltash, and the rural hinterland. The campaign was not successful, and Plymouth ceased to be a county borough on 1 April 1974 with responsibility for education, social services, highways and libraries transferred to Devon County Council. All powers returned when the city became a unitary authority on 1 April 1998 under recommendations of the Banham Commission.

===Constituencies===
In the Parliament of the United Kingdom, Plymouth is represented by the three constituencies of Plymouth Moor View, Plymouth Sutton and Devonport and South West Devon. Prior to Brexit in 2020 it was represented within the European Parliament as South West England.

In 1919, Nancy Astor was elected the first-ever female member of parliament to take office in the British Houses of Parliament for the constituency of Plymouth Sutton. She was elected to the seat vacated by her husband Waldorf Astor on his elevation to the peerage. Lady Astor was a vibrantly active campaigner for her resident constituents.

In 1945, Plymouth-born Michael Foot was elected Labour MP for the constituency of Plymouth Devonport which had been heavily damaged in the Plymouth Blitz. He represented the seat until 1955. After serving as Secretary of State for Education and being responsible for the 1974 Health and Safety at Work Act, he went on to become the leader of the Labour Party (1980–1983).

=== City Council ===

The City of Plymouth is divided into 20 wards, 17 of which elect three councillors and the other three electing two councillors, making up a total council of 57. Elections are held three years out of every four, with a third of the council being elected each time for a four year term. The total for Plymouth&#x27;s Parliamentary constituencies was 190,006 in April 2019. Since May 2023 Plymouth has had a Labour majority Council. Plymouth City Council is formally twinned with: Brest, France (1963), Gdynia, Poland (1976), Novorossiysk, Russia (1990) San Sebastián, Spain (1990) and Plymouth, United States (2001).

Plymouth was granted the dignity of Lord Mayor by King George V in 1935. The position is elected each year by a group of six councillors. It is traditional that the position of the Lord Mayor alternates between the Conservative Party and the Labour Party annually and that the Lord Mayor chooses the Deputy Lord Mayor.
The Lord Mayor&#x27;s official residence is 3 Elliot Terrace, located on the Hoe. Once a home of Waldorf and Nancy Astor, it was given by Lady Astor to the City of Plymouth as an official residence for future Lord Mayors and is also used today for civic hospitality, as lodgings for visiting dignitaries and High Court judges and it is also available to hire for private events. The Civic Centre municipal office building in Armada Way became a listed building in June 2007 because of its quality and period features, but has become the centre of a controversy as the council planned for its demolition estimating that it could cost £40m to refurbish it, resulting in possible job losses.

== Geography ==
Plymouth lies between the River Plym to the east and the River Tamar to the west; both rivers flow into the natural harbour of Plymouth Sound. Since 1967, the unitary authority of Plymouth has included the, once independent, towns of Plympton and Plymstock which lie along the east of the River Plym. The River Tamar forms the county boundary between Devon and Cornwall and its estuary forms the Hamoaze on which is sited Devonport Dockyard.

The River Plym, which flows off Dartmoor to the north-east, forms a smaller estuary to the east of the city called Cattewater. Plymouth Sound is protected from the sea by the Plymouth Breakwater, in use since 1814. In the Sound is Drake&#x27;s Island which is seen from Plymouth Hoe, a flat public area on top of limestone cliffs. The Unitary Authority of Plymouth is . The topography rises from sea level to a height, at Roborough, of about above Ordnance Datum (AOD).

Geologically, Plymouth has a mixture of limestone, Devonian slate, granite and Middle Devonian limestone. Plymouth Sound, Shores and Cliffs is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, because of its geology. The bulk of the city is built upon Upper Devonian slates and shales and the headlands at the entrance to Plymouth Sound are formed of Lower Devonian slates, which can withstand the power of the sea.

A band of Middle Devonian limestone runs west to east from Cremyll to Plymstock including the Hoe. Local limestone may be seen in numerous buildings, walls and pavements throughout Plymouth. To the north and northeast of the city is the granite mass of Dartmoor; the granite was mined and exported via Plymouth. Rocks brought down the Tamar from Dartmoor include ores containing tin, copper, tungsten, lead and other minerals. There is evidence that the middle Devonian limestone belt at the south edge of Plymouth and in Plymstock was quarried at West Hoe, Cattedown and Radford.

=== Urban form ===

On 27 April 1944 Sir Patrick Abercrombie&#x27;s &quot;Plan for Plymouth&quot; to rebuild the bomb-damaged city was published; it called for demolition of the few remaining pre-War buildings in the city centre to make way for their replacement with wide, parallel, modern boulevards aligned east–west linked by a north–south avenue (Armada Way) linking the railway station with the vista of Plymouth Hoe.

A peripheral road system connecting the historic Barbican on the east and Union Street to the west determines the principal form of the city centre, even following pedestrianisation of the shopping centre in the late 1980s, and continues to inform the present &#x27;Vision for Plymouth&#x27; developed by a team led by Barcelona-based architect David MacKay in 2003 which calls for revivification of the city centre with mixed-use and residential.

In suburban areas, post-War prefabs had already begun to appear by 1946, and over 1,000 permanent council houses were built each year from 1951 to 1957 according to the Modernist zoned low-density garden city model advocated by Abercrombie. By 1964 over 20,000 new homes had been built, more than 13,500 of them permanent council homes and 853 built by the Admiralty.

Plymouth is home to 28 parks with an average size of . Its largest park is Central Park, with other sizeable green spaces including Victoria Park, Freedom Fields Park, Alexandra Park, Devonport Park and the Hoe. Central Park is the home of Plymouth Argyle Football Club and a number of other leisure facilities.

The Plymouth Plan 2019–2034 was published May 2019 and sets the direction for future development with a new spatial strategy which reinforces links with the wider region in west Devon and east Cornwall in its Joint Local Plan and identifies three development areas within the city: the City centre and waterfront; a &#x27;northern corridor&#x27; including Derriford and the vacant airfield site at Roborough; and an &#x27;eastern corridor&#x27; including major new settlements at Sherford and Langage. Plymouth is categorized as a Small-Port City using the Southampton System for port-city classification.

=== Climate ===
Plymouth has a moderated temperate oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) which is wetter and milder than the rest of England. This means a wide range of exotic plants, palm trees, and yuccas can be cultivated. The annual mean high temperature is approximately . Due to the moderating effect of the sea and the south-westerly location, the climate is among the mildest of British cities, and one of the warmest UK cities in winter. The coldest month of February is similarly moderate, having mild mean minimum temperatures between . Snow usually falls in small amounts but a noteworthy recent exception was the period of the European winter storms of 2009–10 which, in early January 2010, covered Plymouth in at least of snow; more on higher ground. Another notable event was the of snowfall between 17 and 19 December 2010 – though only would lie at any one time due to melting. Over the 1961–1990 period, annual snowfall accumulation averaged less than per year.

South West England has a favoured location when the Azores High pressure area extends north-eastwards towards the UK, particularly in summer. Coastal areas have average annual sunshine totals over 1,600 hours.

Owing to its geographic location, rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection and is more frequent and heavier than in London and southeast England. The Atlantic depressions are more vigorous in autumn and winter and most of the rain which falls in those seasons in the south-west is from this source. Average annual rainfall is around . November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.

Typically, the warmest day of the year (1971–2000) will achieve a temperature of , although in July 2022 the temperature reached , the site record. On average, 4.25 days of the year will report a maximum temperature of or above. During the winter half of the year, the coldest night will typically fall to although in January 1979 the temperature fell to . Typically, 18.6 nights of the year will register an air frost.


== Education ==
There are three universities based in Plymouth, the University of Plymouth, Plymouth Marjon University and the Arts University Plymouth.

The University of Plymouth enrolls 23,155 total students as of 2018/2019 (largest in the UK out of ). It also employs 2,900 staff with an annual income of around £160 million. It was founded in 1992 from Polytechnic South West (formerly Plymouth Polytechnic) following the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. It has a wide range of courses including those in marine focused business, marine engineering, marine biology and Earth, ocean and environmental sciences, surf science, shipping and logistics. The university formed a joint venture with the fellow Devonian University of Exeter in 2000, establishing the Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry. The college is ranked 8th out of 30 universities in the UK in 2011 for medicine. Its dental school was established in 2006, which also provides free dental care in an attempt to improve access to dental care in the South West.

The University of St Mark &amp; St John (known as &quot;Marjon&quot; or &quot;Marjons&quot;) specialises in teacher training, and offers training across the country and abroad.

Arts University Plymouth offers a selection of courses including media. It was originally founded as the Plymouth Drawing School in 1856, and in December 2008, Plymouth College of Art and Design was renamed to Plymouth College of Art. In May 2022, the College was awarded University status, and became Arts University Plymouth.

The city is also home to two large colleges. The City College Plymouth provides courses from the most basic to Foundation degrees for approximately 26,000 students.

Plymouth also has 71 state primary phase schools, 13 state secondary schools, eight special schools and three selective state grammar schools, Devonport High School for Girls, Devonport High School for Boys and Plymouth High School for Girls. There is also a private all-through school Plymouth College.

The city was also home to the Royal Naval Engineering College; opened in 1880 in Keyham, it trained engineering students for five years before they completed the remaining two years of the course at Greenwich. The college closed in 1910, but in 1940 a new college opened at Manadon. This was renamed &quot;Dockyard Technical College&quot; in 1959 before finally closing in 1994; training was transferred to the University of Southampton.

Plymouth is home to the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom (MBA; founded 1884) which conducts research in all areas of the marine sciences. The Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML; founded 1988) was formed in part from components of the MBA. Together with the National Marine Aquarium, the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Sciences, Plymouth University&#x27;s Marine Institute and the Diving Diseases Research Centre, these marine-related organisations form the Plymouth Marine Sciences Partnership. The Plymouth Marine Laboratory, which focuses on global issues of climate change and sustainability. It monitors the effects of ocean acidity on corals and shellfish and reports the results to the UK government. It also cultivates algae that could be used to make biofuels or in the treatment of wastewater by using technology such as photo-bioreactors. It works alongside the Boots Group to investigate the use of algae in skincare protects, taking advantage of the chemicals they contain that adapt to protect themselves from the sun.

A scheme is in operation over summer 2018 to provide meals during the summer holidays for children with parents on a low income, the parents cannot afford to provide their children with healthy meals.

UPSU also known as the University of Plymouth Student Union is based underground near the library. Every student at the University of Plymouth is a member of UPSU. The Union employs students across the University, from bar staff to events technicians. Every year the students at the University have an opportunity to vote which sabbatical officers represent them. In 2019 over 4000 students voted in the UPSU elections.

== Demography ==
From the 2011 Census, the Office for National Statistics published that Plymouth&#x27;s unitary authority area population was 256,384; 15,664 more people than that of the last census from 2001, which indicated that Plymouth had a population of 240,720. The Plymouth urban area had a population of 260,203 in 2011 (the urban sprawl which extends outside the authority&#x27;s boundaries). The city&#x27;s average household size was 2.3 persons. At the time of the 2011 UK census, the ethnic composition of Plymouth&#x27;s population was 96.2% White (of 92.9% was White British), with the largest minority ethnic group being Chinese at 0.5%. The white Irish ethnic group saw the largest decline in its share of the population since the 2001 Census (−24%), while the &quot;Other Asian&quot; and Black African had the largest increases (360% and 351% respectively). This excludes the two new ethnic groups added to the 2011 census of Gypsy or Irish Traveller and Arab. The population rose rapidly during the second half of the 19th century, but declined by over 1.6% from 1931 to 1951.

Plymouth&#x27;s gross value added (a measure of the size of its economy) was £5,169 million in 2013 making up 25% of Devon&#x27;s GVA. Its GVA per person was £19,943 and compared to the national average of £23,755, was £3,812 lower. Plymouth&#x27;s unemployment rate was 7.0% in 2014 which was 2.0 points higher than the South West average and 0.8 points higher than the average for Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland).

A 2014 profile by the National Health Service showed Plymouth had higher than average levels of poverty and deprivation (26.2% of the population among the poorest 20.4% nationally). Life expectancy in Plymouth is 78.8 years for men and 82.5 for women
== Economy ==

Because of its coastal location, the economy of Plymouth has traditionally been , in particular the defence sector with over 12,000 people employed and approximately 7,500 in the armed forces. The Plymouth Gin Distillery has been producing Plymouth Gin since 1793, which was exported around the world by the Royal Navy. During the 1930s, it was the most widely distributed gin and had a controlled term of origin until 2015. Since the 1980s, employment in the defence sector has decreased substantially and the public sector is now prominent particularly in administration, health, education, medicine and engineering.

Devonport Dockyard is the UK&#x27;s only naval base that refits nuclear submarines and the Navy estimates that the Dockyard generates about 10% of Plymouth&#x27;s income. Plymouth has the largest cluster of marine and maritime businesses in the south west with 270 firms operating within the sector. Other substantial employers include the university with almost 3,000 staff, the national retail chain The Range at their Estover headquarters, as well as the Plymouth Science Park employing 500 people in 50 companies.

Plymouth has a post-war shopping area in the city centre with substantial pedestrianisation. At the west end of the zone inside a grade II listed building is the Pannier Market that was completed in 1959 – &quot;pannier&quot; meaning &quot;basket&quot; from French, so it translates as &quot;basket market&quot;. In terms of retail floorspace, Plymouth is ranked in the top five in the South West, and 29th nationally. Plymouth was one of the first ten British cities to trial the new Business improvement district initiative. The Tinside Pool is situated at the foot of the Hoe and became a grade II listed building in 1998 before being restored to its 1930s look for £3.4 million.

=== Plymouth 2020 ===

Since 2003, Plymouth Council has been undertaking a project of urban redevelopment called the &quot;Vision for Plymouth&quot; launched by the architect David Mackay and backed by both Plymouth City Council and the Plymouth Chamber of Commerce (PCC). With the aim of growing the population to 300,000 by building 33,000 new dwellings, its projects range from shopping centres, new public realm, a cruise terminal, rebalancing the underutilised city centre retail district and opening waterfront development linked by a new urban boulevard.
In 2004 the old Drake Circus shopping centre and Charles Cross car park were demolished and replaced by the latest Drake Circus Shopping Centre, which opened in October 2006. It received negative feedback before opening when David Mackay said it was already &quot;ten years out of date&quot;. It was awarded the first ever Carbuncle Cup, awarded for Britain&#x27;s ugliest building, in 2006. In contrast, the Theatre Royal&#x27;s production and education centre, TR2, which was built on wasteland at Cattedown, was a runner-up for the RIBA Stirling Prize for Architecture in 2003.

Proposals included the demolition of the Plymouth Pavilions entertainment arena to create a canal &quot;boulevard&quot; linking Millbay to the city centre delivered in 2020. Millbay is being regenerated with mixed residential, retail and office space alongside the ferry port.

Plymouth&#x27;s Civic Centre was vacated by Plymouth City Council, and their operations were dispersed across the city centre—the vacant and dilapidated modernist building was proposed for demolition by the Council but was ultimately saved by a listing in 2007 for its national architectural merit and was gifted to the developers Urban Splash, who intend to refurbish the structure for a mixed-use regeneration including variable let accommodation. The removal and relocation of Bretonside bus station—a site originally earmarked for the Council—was ultimately released for a mixed-use commercial leisure redevelopment including cinema and restaurants named &#x27;Barcode&#x27; owned by British Land which also owns the adjacent Drake&#x27;s Circus.

== Transport ==

===Railway===


Plymouth railway station is served by two train operating companies:

* Great Western Railway operates inter-city services to , , , , , and ; local services run to . It also manages the station.
* CrossCountry operate services from the South West to the Midlands, North East and Scotland; destinations include Bristol, , , , , , , and .

Smaller stations in the suburban area west of the city centre are served by trains on the Tamar Valley Line to Gunnislake and local services on the Cornish Main Line, which crosses the Tamar on the Royal Albert Bridge. This was designed by Brunel and opened in 1859. The parallel road bridge was completed in 1961.

====History====
The station opened on its present site in 1877 and was previously named &quot;Plymouth North Road&quot;, when there were other main line stations in the city at Millbay and Friary; these have since closed.

====Future====
There have been proposals to reopen the Exeter to Plymouth railway of the LSWR which would connect Cornwall and Plymouth to Exeter using the former Southern Railway main line from Plymouth to Exeter via , because the main line through South Devon is vulnerable to damage from rough seas at , where some of the cliffs are also fragile. There are related proposals to reopen part of the old main line from Bere Alston on the Plymouth-Gunnislake line as far as Tavistock to serve a new housing development but, although the idea has been discussed since 2008, progress has been slow.

===Roads===
The A38 dual-carriageway runs from east to west across the north of the city; within the city, it is known as &#x27;The Parkway&#x27; and represents the boundary between the older parts of the city and more recently developed suburban areas. Heading east, it connects Plymouth to the M5 motorway, about away near Exeter; heading west, it connects Devon with Cornwall via the Tamar Bridge.

===Buses===
Bus services are provided mainly by Plymouth Citybus and Stagecoach South West, but a few routes are served by smaller local operators. Long distance inter-city bus services terminate at Plymouth coach station.

There are three Park and Ride services at Milehouse, Coypool (Plympton) and George Junction (Plymouth City Airport), which are operated by Stagecoach South West except Milehouse park and ride. This is served by Plymouth Citybus

=== Ferries ===

A regular international ferry service provided by Brittany Ferries operates from Millbay taking cars and foot passengers directly to France (Roscoff) and Spain (Santander) on the three ferries, &quot;MV Armorique&quot;, &quot;MV Bretagne&quot; and &quot;MV Pont-Aven&quot;. The Cremyll Ferry is a passenger ferry between Stonehouse and the Cornish hamlet of Cremyll, which is believed to have operated continuously since 1204. There is also a pedestrian ferry from the Mayflower Steps to Mount Batten, and an alternative to using the Tamar Bridge via the Torpoint Ferry (vehicle and pedestrian) across the River Tamar.

=== Air ===
The city&#x27;s airport was Plymouth City Airport about north of the city centre.
The airport was home to the local airline Air Southwest,
which operated flights across the United Kingdom and Ireland. In June 2003, a report by the South West RDA was published looking at the future of aviation in the south-west and the possible closure of airports. It concluded that the best option for the south-west was to close Plymouth City Airport and expand Exeter International Airport and Newquay Cornwall Airport, although it did conclude that this was not the best option for Plymouth. In April 2011, it was announced that the airport would close, which it did on 23 December. A local company, FlyPlymouth, put forward plans in 2015 to reopen the airport by 2018, providing daily services to various destinations including London, but as of now, these projects have stalled.

=== Cycle routes ===
Plymouth is at the southern end of the long Devon Coast to Coast Cycle Route (National Cycle Route 27). The route runs mostly traffic-free on off-road sections between Ilfracombe and Plymouth. The route uses former railway lines, though there are some stretches on public roads.

Since 1973 Plymouth has been supplied water by South West Water. Prior to the 1973 take over it was supplied by Plymouth County Borough Corporation. Before the 19th century two leats were built to provide drinking water for the town. They carried water from Dartmoor to Plymouth. A watercourse, known as Plymouth or Drake&#x27;s Leat, was opened on 24 April 1591 to tap the River Meavy. The Devonport Leat was constructed to carry fresh drinking water to the expanding town of Devonport and its ever-growing dockyard. It was fed by three Dartmoor rivers: The West Dart, Cowsic and Blackabrook. It seems to have been carrying water since 1797, but it was officially completed in 1801. It was originally designed to carry water to Devonport town but has since been shortened and now carries water to Burrator Reservoir, which feeds most of the water supply of Plymouth. Burrator Reservoir is located about north of the city and was constructed in 1898 and expanded in 1928.

<text>In computer networking, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a data link layer (layer 2) communication protocol between two routers directly without any host or any other networking in between. It can provide loop detection, authentication, transmission encryption, and data compression.

PPP is used over many types of physical networks, including serial cable, phone line, trunk line, cellular telephone, specialized radio links, ISDN, and fiber optic links such as SONET. Since IP packets cannot be transmitted over a modem line on their own without some data link protocol that can identify where the transmitted frame starts and where it ends, Internet service providers (ISPs) have used PPP for customer dial-up access to the Internet.

PPP is used on former dial-up networking lines. Two derivatives of PPP, Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) and Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM (PPPoA), are used most commonly by ISPs to establish a digital subscriber line (DSL) Internet service LP connection with customers.

==Description==
PPP is very commonly used as a data-link-layer protocol for connection over synchronous and asynchronous circuits, where it has largely superseded the older Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) and telephone company mandated standards (such as Link Access Protocol, Balanced (LAPB) in the X.25 protocol suite). The only requirement for PPP is that the circuit provided be duplex. PPP was made to work with numerous network-layer protocols, including Internet Protocol (IP), TRILL, Novell&#x27;s Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX), NBF, DECnet and AppleTalk. Like SLIP, this is a full Internet connection over telephone lines via modem. It is more reliable than SLIP because it double checks to ensure Internet packets arrive intact. It resends any damaged packets.

PPP was designed somewhat after the original HDLC specifications. The people who had designed PPP included many additional features that had been seen only in proprietary data-link protocols up to that time. PPP is specified in RFC 1661.

RFC 2516 describes Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) as a method for transmitting PPP over Ethernet that is sometimes used with DSL. RFC 2364 describes Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM (PPPoA) as a method for transmitting PPP over ATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5), which is also a common alternative to PPPoE used with DSL.

PPP, PPPoE and PPPoA are widely used in WAN lines.

PPP is a layered protocol that has three components:
# An encapsulation component that is used to transmit datagrams over the specified physical layer.
# A Link Control Protocol (LCP) to establish, configure, and test the link as well as negotiate settings, options and the use of features.
# One or more Network Control Protocols (NCP) used to negotiate optional configuration parameters and facilities for the network layer. There is one NCP for each higher-layer protocol supported by PPP.

===Automatic self configuration===

LCP initiates and terminates connections gracefully, allowing hosts to negotiate connection options. It is an integral part of PPP, and is defined in the same standard specification. LCP provides automatic configuration of the interfaces at each end (such as setting datagram size, escaped characters, and magic numbers) and for selecting optional authentication. The LCP protocol runs on top of PPP (with PPP protocol number 0xC021) and therefore a basic PPP connection has to be established before LCP is able to configure it.

RFC 1994 describes Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP), which is preferred for establishing dial-up connections with ISPs.
Although deprecated, Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) is still sometimes used.

Another option for authentication over PPP is Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) described in RFC 2284.

After the link has been established, additional network (layer 3) configuration may take place. Most commonly, the Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP) is used, although Internetwork Packet Exchange Control Protocol (IPXCP) and AppleTalk Control Protocol (ATCP) were once popular. Internet Protocol Version 6 Control Protocol (IPv6CP) will see extended use in the future, when IPv6 replaces IPv4 as the dominant layer-3 protocol.

===Multiple network layer protocols===

PPP permits multiple network layer protocols to operate on the same communication link. For every network layer protocol used, a separate Network Control Protocol (NCP) is provided in order to encapsulate and negotiate options for the multiple network layer protocols. It negotiates network-layer information, e.g. network address or compression options, after the connection has been established.

For example, IP uses IPCP, and Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) uses the Novell IPX Control Protocol (IPX/SPX). NCPs include fields containing standardized codes to indicate the network layer protocol type that the PPP connection encapsulates.

The following NCPs may be used with PPP:
* IPCP for IP, protocol code number 0x8021, RFC 1332
* the OSI Network Layer Control Protocol (OSINLCP) for the various OSI network layer protocols, protocol code number 0x8023, RFC 1377
* the AppleTalk Control Protocol (ATCP) for AppleTalk, protocol code number 0x8029, RFC 1378
* the Internetwork Packet Exchange Control Protocol (IPXCP) for the Internet Packet Exchange, protocol code number 0x802B, RFC 1552
* the DECnet Phase IV Control Protocol (DNCP) for DNA Phase IV Routing protocol (DECnet Phase IV), protocol code number 0x8027, RFC 1762
* the NetBIOS Frames Control Protocol (NBFCP) for the NetBIOS Frames protocol (or NetBEUI as it was called before that), protocol code number 0x803F, RFC 2097
* the IPv6 Control Protocol (IPV6CP) for IPv6, protocol code number 0x8057, RFC 5072

===Looped link detection===

PPP detects looped links using a feature involving magic numbers. When the node sends PPP LCP messages, these messages may include a magic number. If a line is looped, the node receives an LCP message with its own magic number, instead of getting a message with the peer&#x27;s magic number.

==Configuration options==
The previous section introduced the use of LCP options to meet specific WAN connection requirements. PPP may include the following LCP options:
*Authentication - Peer routers exchange authentication messages. Two authentication choices are Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) and Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP). Authentication is explained in the next section.
*Compression - Increases the effective throughput on PPP connections by reducing the amount of data in the frame that must travel across the link, using a agreed-on algorithm such as BSD compress or Deflate. The protocol decompresses the frame at its destination. See for more details.
*Error detection - Identifies fault conditions. The Quality and Magic Number options help ensure a reliable, loop-free data link. The Magic Number field helps in detecting links that are in a looped-back condition. Until the Magic-Number Configuration Option has been successfully negotiated, the Magic-Number must be transmitted as zero. Magic numbers are generated randomly at each end of the connection.
*Multilink - Provides load balancing several interfaces used by PPP through Multilink PPP (see below).

==PPP frame==

===Structure===
PPP frames are variants of HDLC frames:

If both peers agree to Address field and Control field compression during LCP, then those fields are omitted. Likewise if both peers agree to Protocol field compression, then the 0x00 byte can be omitted.

The Protocol field indicates the type of payload packet: 0xC021 for LCP, 0x80xy for various NCPs, 0x0021 for IP, 0x0029 AppleTalk, 0x002B for IPX, 0x003D for Multilink, 0x003F for NetBIOS, 0x00FD for MPPC and MPPE, etc. PPP is limited, and cannot contain general Layer 3 data, unlike EtherType.

The Information field contains the PPP payload; it has a variable length with a negotiated maximum called the Maximum Transmission Unit. By default, the maximum is 1500 octets. It might be padded on transmission; if the information for a particular protocol can be padded, that protocol must allow information to be distinguished from padding.

===Encapsulation===
PPP frames are encapsulated in a lower-layer protocol that provides framing and may provide other functions such as a checksum to detect transmission errors. PPP on serial links is usually encapsulated in a framing similar to HDLC, described by IETF RFC 1662.
The Flag field is present when PPP with HDLC-like framing is used.

The Address and Control fields always have the value hex FF (for &quot;all stations&quot;) and hex 03 (for &quot;unnumbered information&quot;), and can be omitted whenever PPP LCP Address-and-Control-Field-Compression (ACFC) is negotiated.

The frame check sequence (FCS) field is used for determining whether an individual frame has an error. It contains a checksum computed over the frame to provide basic protection against errors in transmission. This is a CRC code similar to the one used for other layer two protocol error protection schemes such as the one used in Ethernet. According to RFC 1662, it can be either 16 bits (2 bytes) or 32 bits (4 bytes) in size (default is 16 bits - Polynomial &quot;x&quot;16 + &quot;x&quot;12 + &quot;x&quot;5 + 1).

The FCS is calculated over the Address, Control, Protocol, Information and Padding fields after the message has been encapsulated.

== Line activation and phases ==

;Link Dead: This phase occurs when the link fails, or one side has been told to disconnect (e.g. a user has finished his or her dialup connection.)
;Link Establishment Phase: This phase is where Link Control Protocol negotiation is attempted. If successful, control goes either to the authentication phase or the Network-Layer Protocol phase, depending on whether authentication is desired.
;Authentication Phase: This phase is optional. It allows the sides to authenticate each other before a connection is established. If successful, control goes to the network-layer protocol phase.
;Network-Layer Protocol Phase: This phase is where each desired protocols&#x27; Network Control Protocols are invoked. For example, IPCP is used in establishing IP service over the line. Data transport for all protocols which are successfully started with their network control protocols also occurs in this phase. Closing down of network protocols also occur in this phase.
;Link Termination Phase: This phase closes down this connection. This can happen if there is an authentication failure, if there are so many checksum errors that the two parties decide to tear down the link automatically, if the link suddenly fails, or if the user decides to hang up a connection.

==Over several links==

=== Multilink PPP ===

Multilink PPP (also referred to as MLPPP, MP, MPPP, MLP, or Multilink) provides a method for spreading traffic across multiple distinct PPP connections. It is defined in RFC 1990. It can be used, for example, to connect a home computer to an Internet Service Provider using two traditional 56k modems, or to connect a company through two leased lines.

On a single PPP line frames cannot arrive out of order, but this is possible when the frames are divided among multiple PPP connections. Therefore, Multilink PPP must number the fragments so they can be put in the right order again when they arrive.

Multilink PPP is an example of a link aggregation technology. Cisco IOS Release 11.1 and later supports Multilink PPP. 

=== Multiclass PPP ===

With PPP, one cannot establish several simultaneous distinct PPP connections over a single link.

That&#x27;s not possible with Multilink PPP either. Multilink PPP uses contiguous numbers for all the fragments of a packet, and as a consequence it is not possible to suspend the sending of a sequence of fragments of one packet in order to send another packet. This prevents from running Multilink PPP multiple times on the same links.

Multiclass PPP is a kind of Multilink PPP where each &quot;class&quot; of traffic uses a separate sequence number space and reassembly buffer. Multiclass PPP is defined in RFC 2686

==Tunnels==

=== Derived protocols ===

PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) is a form of PPP between two hosts via GRE using encryption (MPPE) and compression (MPPC).

=== As a layer 2 protocol between both ends of a tunnel ===

Many protocols can be used to tunnel data over IP networks. Some of them, like SSL, SSH, or L2TP create virtual network interfaces and give the impression of direct physical connections between the tunnel endpoints. On a Linux host for example, these interfaces would be called tun0 or ppp0.

As there are only two endpoints on a tunnel, the tunnel is a point-to-point connection and PPP is a natural choice as a data link layer protocol between the virtual network interfaces. PPP can assign IP addresses to these virtual interfaces, and these IP addresses can be used, for example, to route between the networks on both sides of the tunnel.

IPsec in tunneling mode does not create virtual physical interfaces at the end of the tunnel, since the tunnel is handled directly by the TCP/IP stack. L2TP can be used to provide these interfaces, this technique is called L2TP/IPsec. In this case too, PPP provides IP addresses to the extremities of the tunnel.

== IETF standards ==
PPP is defined in RFC 1661 (The Point-to-Point Protocol, July 1994). RFC 1547 (Requirements for an Internet Standard Point-to-Point Protocol, December 1993) provides historical information about the need for PPP and its development. A series of related RFCs have been written to define how a variety of network control protocols, including TCP/IP, DECnet, AppleTalk, IPX, work with PPP; they can be found on the Datatracker IETF website.

<text>The Patterson–Gimlin film (also known as the Patterson film or the PGF) is an American short motion picture of an unidentified subject that the filmmakers have said was a Bigfoot. The footage was shot in 1967 in Northern California, and has since been subjected to many attempts to authenticate or debunk it.

The footage was filmed alongside Bluff Creek, a tributary of the Klamath River, about northwest of Orleans, California, in Del Norte County on the Six Rivers National Forest. The film site is roughly south of Oregon and east of the Pacific Ocean. For decades, the exact location of the site was lost, primarily because of re-growth of foliage in the streambed after the flood of 1964. It was rediscovered in 2011. It is just south of a north-running segment of the creek informally known as &quot;the bowling alley&quot;.

The filmmakers were Roger Patterson (1933–1972) and Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Gimlin (born 1931). Patterson died of cancer in 1972 and &quot;maintained right to the end that the creature on the film was real&quot;. Patterson&#x27;s friend, Gimlin, has always denied being involved in any part of a hoax with Patterson. Gimlin mostly avoided publicly discussing the subject from at least the early 1970s until about 2005 (except for three appearances), when he began giving interviews and appearing at Bigfoot conferences.

The film is long (preceded by of &quot;horseback&quot; footage), has 954 frames, and runs for 59.5 seconds at 16 frames per second. If the film was shot at 18 fps, as Grover Krantz believed, the event lasted 53 seconds. The date was October 20, 1967, according to the filmmakers, although some critics believe it was shot earlier.

==Background==
Patterson said he became interested in Bigfoot after reading an article about the creature by Ivan T. Sanderson in &quot;True&quot; magazine in December 1959. In 1961 Sanderson published his encyclopedic &quot;Abominable Snowmen: Legend Come to Life,&quot; a worldwide survey of accounts of Bigfoot-type creatures, including recent track finds, etc. in the Bluff Creek area, which heightened his interest. Thereafter, Marian Place wrote:

Patterson&#x27;s book, &quot;Do Abominable Snowmen of America Really Exist?&quot;, was self-published in 1966. The book has been characterized as &quot;little more than a collection of newspaper clippings laced together with Patterson&#x27;s circus-poster style prose&quot;. The book, however, contains 20 pages of previously unpublished interviews and letters, 17 drawings by Patterson of the encounters described in the text, 5 hand-drawn maps (rare in subsequent Bigfoot books), and almost 20 photos and illustrations from others. It was first reprinted in 1996 by Chris Murphy, and then again re-issued by Murphy in 2005 under the title &quot;The Bigfoot Film Controversy,&quot; with 81 pages of additional material by Murphy.

In May/June 1967 Patterson began filming a docudrama or pseudo-documentary about cowboys being led by an old miner and a wise Indian tracker on a hunt for Bigfoot. The storyline called for Patterson, his Indian guide (Gimlin in a wig), and the cowboys to recall in flashbacks the stories of Fred Beck (of the 1924 Ape Canyon incident) and others as they tracked the beast on horseback. For actors and cameraman, Patterson used at least nine volunteer acquaintances, including Gimlin and Bob Heironimus, for three days of shooting, perhaps over the Memorial Day weekend. Patterson would have needed a costume to represent Bigfoot, if the time came to shoot such climactic scenes.

Prior to the October 1967 filming, Patterson apparently visited Los Angeles on these occasions:
* Patterson drove to Hollywood in 1964 and visited rockabilly songwriter and guitarist Jerry Lee Merritt, a Yakima native who was living in Hollywood then. He was trying to sell his hoop-toy invention.
* In 1966 he visited Merritt again while he was still trying to sell his hoop-toy invention.
Merritt soon moved back to Yakima and became Patterson&#x27;s neighbor, and later his collaborator on his Bigfoot documentary.
* Later in 1966 he and Merritt drove down there for several purposes. Patterson visited cowboy film star Roy Rogers for help. He tried to sell his ponies-and-wagon to Disneyland or Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm.
* In the summer of 1967, apparently after getting $700 from the Radfords and shooting some of his documentary, they tried unsuccessfully to attract investors to help further fund his Bigfoot movie. They copyrighted or trademarked the term &quot;Bigfoot&quot;.

Both Patterson and Gimlin had been rodeo riders and amateur boxers—and local champions in their weight classes. Patterson had played high school football.

In October 1967, Patterson and his friend Gimlin set out for the Six Rivers National Forest in far Northern California. They drove in Gimlin&#x27;s truck, carrying his provisions and three horses, positioned sideways. Patterson chose the area because of intermittent reports of the creatures in the past, and of their enormous footprints since 1958. (His familiarity with the area and its residents from prior visits may also have been a factor.)

The most recent of these reports was the nearby Blue Creek Mountain track find, which was investigated by journalist John Green, Bigfoot hunter René Dahinden, and archaeologist Don Abbott on and after August 28, 1967. This find was reported to Patterson (via his wife) soon thereafter by Al Hodgson, owner of the Willow Creek Variety Store.

Though Gimlin says he doubted the existence of Sasquatch-like creatures, he agreed to Patterson&#x27;s insistence that they should not attempt to shoot one.

==Encounter==

As their stories went, in the early afternoon of Friday, October 20, 1967, Patterson and Gimlin were riding generally northeast (upstream) on horseback along the east bank of Bluff Creek. At sometime between 1:15 and 1:40p.m., they &quot;came to an overturned tree with a large root system at a turn in the creek, almost as high as a room&quot;.

When they rounded it, &quot;there was a logjam—a &#x27;crow&#x27;s nest&#x27;—left over from the flood of &#x27;64,&quot; and then they spotted the figure behind it nearly simultaneously. It was either &quot;crouching beside the creek to their left&quot; or &quot;standing&quot; there, on the opposite bank. Gimlin later described himself as in a mild state of shock after first seeing the figure.

Patterson initially estimated its height at to , and later raised his estimate to about . Some later analysts, anthropologist Grover Krantz among them, have suggested Patterson&#x27;s later estimate was about too tall. Gimlin&#x27;s estimate was .

The film shows what Patterson and Gimlin claimed was a large, hairy, bipedal, apelike figure with short, &quot;silvery brown&quot; or &quot;dark reddish-brown&quot; or &quot;black&quot; hair covering most of its body, including its prominent breasts. The figure in the film generally matches the descriptions of Bigfoot offered by others who claim to have seen one.

Patterson estimated he was about away from the creature at his closest. Patterson said that his horse reared upon sensing the figure, and he spent about 20 seconds extricating himself from the saddle, controlling his horse, getting around to its other side, and getting his camera from a saddlebag before he could run toward the figure while operating his camera. He yelled &quot;Cover me&quot; to Gimlin, &quot;meaning to get the gun out&quot;. Gimlin crossed the creek on horseback after Patterson had run well beyond it, riding on a path somewhat to the left of Patterson&#x27;s and somewhat beyond his position. Patterson estimates he came within of &quot;Patty&quot;. Then, rifle in hand, he dismounted, but did not point his rifle at the creature.

The figure had walked away from them to a distance of about before Patterson began to run after it. The resulting film (about 59.5 seconds long at 16 fps) is initially quite shaky until Patterson got about from the figure. At that point, the figure glanced over its right shoulder at the men and Patterson fell to his knees; on Krantz&#x27;s map this corresponds to frame 264. To researcher John Green, Patterson would later characterize the creature&#x27;s expression as one of &quot;contempt and disgust ... you know how it is when the umpire tells you &#x27;one more word and you&#x27;re out of the game.&#x27; That&#x27;s the way it felt.&quot;

Shortly after this point the steady, middle portion of the film begins, containing the famous look-back frame 352. Patterson said, &quot;it turned a total of I think three times,&quot; the other times therefore being before the filming began and/or while he was running with his finger off the trigger. Shortly after glancing over its shoulder on film, the creature disappeared behind a grove of trees for 14 seconds, then reappeared in the film&#x27;s final 15 seconds after Patterson moved to a better vantage point, fading into the trees again and being lost to view at a distance of as the reel of film ran out.

Gimlin remounted and followed it on horseback, keeping his distance, until it disappeared around a bend in the road away. Patterson called him back at that point, feeling vulnerable on foot without a rifle, because he feared the creature&#x27;s mate might approach. The entire encounter had lasted less than two minutes.

Next, Gimlin and Patterson rounded up Patterson&#x27;s horses, which had run off in the opposite direction, downstream, before the filming began. Patterson got his second roll of film from his saddlebag and filmed the tracks. Then the men tracked &quot;Patty&quot; for either or , but &quot;lost it in the heavy undergrowth&quot;. They went to their campsite south, picked up plaster, returned to the initial site, measured the creature&#x27;s step-length, and made two plaster casts, one each of the best-quality right and left prints.

===Details===
According to Patterson and Gimlin, they were the only witnesses to their brief encounter with what they claimed was a sasquatch. Their statements agree in general, but author Greg Long notes a number of inconsistencies. They offered somewhat different sequences in describing how they and the horses reacted upon seeing the creature. Patterson in particular increased his estimates of the creature&#x27;s size in subsequent retellings of the encounter. In a different context, Long argues, these discrepancies would probably be considered minor, but given the extraordinary claims made by Patterson and Gimlin, any apparent disagreements in perception or memory are worth noting.

The film&#x27;s defenders have responded by saying that commercially motivated hoaxers would have &quot;got their stories straight&quot; beforehand so they would not have disagreed immediately upon being interviewed, and on so many points, and so they wouldn&#x27;t have created a suit and a creature with foreseeably objectionable features and behaviors.

A more serious objection concerns the film&#x27;s &quot;timeline&quot;. This is important because Kodachrome II movie film, as far as is known, could be developed only by a lab containing a $60,000+ machine, and the few West Coast labs known to possess one did not do developing over weekends. Patterson&#x27;s brother-in-law Al DeAtley claims not to remember where he took the film for development or where he picked it up.

Critics claim that too much happened between the filming (at 1:15 at the earliest) and the filmmakers&#x27; arrival in Willow Creek (at 6:30 at the latest). Daegling wrote, &quot;All of the problems with the timeline disappear if the film is shot a few days or hours beforehand. If that is the case, one has to wonder what other details of this story are wrong.&quot; The film&#x27;s defenders retort that although the time window was tight, it was do-able.

Chris Murphy wrote, &quot;I have confirmed with Bob Gimlin that Patterson definitely rode a small quarter horse (which he owned), not his Welsh pony &#x27;Peanuts&#x27;. Also, that Patterson had arranged to borrow a horse by the name of &#x27;Chico&#x27; from Bob Heironimus for Gimlin to use[...] Gimlin did not have a horse that was suitable (old enough) for the expedition.&quot; Heironimus stated that Chico (a middle-aged gelding) &quot;wouldn&#x27;t jump or buck&quot;.

==Immediate aftermath==
At approximately 6:30p.m., Patterson and Gimlin met up with Al Hodgson at his variety store in Willow Creek, approximately south by road, about by Bluff Creek Road from their camp to the 1967 roadhead by Bluff Creek, and down California State Route 96 to Willow Creek. Patterson intended to drive on to Eureka to ship his film. Either at that time, or when he arrived in the Eureka/Arcata area, he called Al DeAtley (his brother-in-law in Yakima) and told him to expect the film he was shipping. He requested Hodgson to call Donald Abbott, whom Grover Krantz described as &quot;the only scientist of any stature to have demonstrated any serious interest in the [Bigfoot] subject,&quot; hoping he would help them search for the creature by bringing a tracking dog. Hodgson called, but Abbott declined. Krantz argued that this call the same day of the encounter is evidence against a hoax, at least on Patterson&#x27;s part.

After shipping the film, they headed back toward their camp, where they had left their horses. On their way they &quot;stopped at the Lower Trinity Ranger Station, as planned, arriving about 9:00p.m. Here they met with Syl McCoy [another friend] and Al Hodgson.&quot; At this point Patterson called the daily &quot;Times-Standard&quot; newspaper in Eureka and related his story. They arrived back at their campsite at about midnight. At either 5 or 5:30 the next morning, after it started to rain heavily, Gimlin returned to the filmsite from the camp and covered the other prints with bark to protect them. The cardboard boxes he had been given by Al Hodgson for this purpose and had left outside were so soggy they were useless, so he left them.

When he returned to the camp he and Patterson aborted their plan to remain looking for more evidence and departed for home, fearing the rain would wash out their exit. After attempting to go out along &quot;the low road&quot;—Bluff Creek Road—and finding it blocked by a mudslide, they went instead up the steep Onion Mountain Road, off whose shoulder their truck slipped; extracting it required the (unauthorized) borrowing of a nearby front-end loader. The drive home from their campsite covered about , the initial on a low-speed logging road, and then about on twisty Route 96. Driving a truck with three horses, and allowing for occasional stops, it would have taken 13 hours to get home Saturday evening, at an average speed of ; it would have taken 14.5 hours at a average speed.

US Forest Service &quot;Timber Management Assistant&quot; Lyle Laverty said, &quot;I [and his team of three, in a Jeep] passed the site on either Thursday the 19th or Friday the 20th&quot; and noticed no tracks. After reading the news of Patterson&#x27;s encounter on their weekend break, Laverty and his team returned to the site on Monday, the 23rd, and made six photos of the tracks. (Laverty later served as an Assistant Secretary of the Interior under George W. Bush.) Taxidermist and outdoorsman Robert Titmus went to the site with his sister and brother-in-law nine days later. Titmus made plaster casts of ten successive prints of the creature and plotted Patterson&#x27;s and the creature&#x27;s movements on a map as well as he could.

==Long-term aftermath==

===Film-related===

Grover Krantz writes that &quot;Patterson had the film developed as soon as possible. At first he thought he had brought in proof of Bigfoot&#x27;s existence and really expected the scientists to accept it. But only a few scientists were willing to even look at the film,&quot; usually at showings at scientific organizations. These were usually arranged at the behest of zoologist, author, and media figure Ivan Sanderson, a supporter of Patterson&#x27;s film. Seven showings occurred, in Vancouver, Manhattan, The Bronx, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and Washington, D.C. again (all by the end of 1968); then, later, in Beaverton, Oregon. Of those who were quoted, most expressed various reservations, although some were willing to say they were intrigued by it.

Christopher Murphy wrote, &quot;Dahinden traveled to Europe [with the film] in 1971. He visited England, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland and Russia. Although scientists in these countries were somewhat more open-minded than those in North America, their findings were basically the same . ... A real glimmer of hope, however, emerged [in Russia, where he met Bayanov, Bourtsev, and their associates].&quot;

Though there was little scientific interest in the film, Patterson was still able to capitalize on it. He made a deal with the BBC, allowing the use of his footage in a docudrama made in return for letting him tour with their docudrama, into which he melded material from his own documentary and additional material he and Al DeAtley filmed. This film was shown in local movie houses around the Pacific Northwest and Midwest. A technique commonly used for nature films called &quot;four-walling&quot; was employed, involving heavy local advertising, mostly on TV, of a few days of showings. It was a modest financial success. Al DeAtley estimated that his 50% of the film&#x27;s profits amounted to $75,000.

The film generated a fair amount of national publicity. Patterson appeared on a few popular TV talk shows to promote the film and belief in Bigfoot by showing excerpts from it: for instance, on the &quot;Joe Pyne Show&quot; in Los Angeles, in 1967, which covered most of the western US; on Merv Griffin&#x27;s program, with Krantz offering his analysis of the film; on Joey Bishop&#x27;s talk show, and also on Johnny Carson&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot;. Articles on the film appeared in &quot;Argosy&quot;, &quot;National Wildlife Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;.

One radio interview, with Gimlin, by Vancouver-based Jack Webster in November 1967, was partly recorded by John Green and reprinted in Loren Coleman&#x27;s &quot;Bigfoot!&quot; Patterson also appeared on broadcast interviews on local stations near where his film would be shown during his four-walling tour in 1968.

Patterson subsequently sold overlapping distribution rights for the film to several parties, which resulted in costly legal entanglements.

After Patterson&#x27;s death, Michael McLeod wrote, &quot;With the consent of Al DeAtley and Patricia Patterson, the film distributor Ron Olson took over the operation of Northwest Research ... and changed its name to the North American Wildlife Research Association. ... He worked full-time compiling reports, soliciting volunteers to join the hunt, and organizing several small expeditions. A Bigfoot trap Olson and his crew built still survives. ... Olson ... continued to lobby the company [American National Enterprises] to produce a Bigfoot film. ... In 1974 ... ANE finally agreed. ... [It was released in 1975,] titled &quot;Bigfoot: Man or Beast&quot;. [H]e devised a storyline involving members of a Bigfoot research party. Olson spent several years exhibiting the film around the country. He planned to make millions with the film, but says it lost money.&quot; Olson is profiled in Barbara Wasson&#x27;s &quot;Sasquatch Apparitions&quot;.

On November 25, 1974, CBS broadcast &quot;Monsters! Mystery or Myth&quot;, a documentary about the Loch Ness Monster and Bigfoot. (It was co-produced by the Smithsonian Institution, which cancelled their contract with the producer the next year). The show attracted fifty million viewers. In 1975, Sunn Classic Pictures released &quot;Bigfoot: The Mysterious Monster&quot; aka &quot;The Mysterious Monsters&quot;, which remixed parts of &quot;Monsters! Mystery or Myth&quot; another documentary called &quot;Land Of The Yeti&quot;, and also included footage from the Patterson–Gimlin film.

===Filmmaker-related===
Patterson&#x27;s expensive ($369) 16 mm camera had been rented on May 13 from photographer Harold Mattson at Sheppard&#x27;s Camera Shop in Yakima, but he had kept it longer than the contract had stipulated, and an arrest warrant had been issued for him on October 17; he was arrested within weeks of his return from Bluff Creek. After Patterson returned the camera in working order, this charge was dismissed, in 1969.

While Patterson sought publicity, Gimlin was conspicuous by his absence. He only briefly helped to promote the film and avoided discussing his Bigfoot encounter publicly for many subsequent years; he turned down requests for interviews. He later reported that he had avoided publicity after Patterson and promoter Al DeAtley had broken their agreement to pay him a one-third share of any profits generated by the film. Another factor was that his wife objected to publicity.

Daegling wrote, &quot;Bigfoot advocates emphasize that Patterson remained an active Bigfoot hunter up until his death.&quot; For instance, in 1969, he hired a pair of brothers to travel around in a truck chasing down leads to Bigfoot witnesses and interviewing them. Later, in December of that year, he was one of those present in Bossburg, Washington, in the aftermath of the cripplefoot tracks found there. Krantz reports that &quot;[a] few years after the film was made, Patterson received a letter from a man [&quot;a US airman stationed in Thailand&quot;] who assured him a Sasquatch was being held in a Buddhist monastery. Patterson spent most of his remaining money preparing an expedition to retrieve this creature&quot; only to learn it was a hoax. He learned this only after having sent Dennis Jenson fruitlessly to Thailand (where he concluded that the airman was &quot;mentally unbalanced&quot;) and then, after receiving a second untrue letter from the man, going himself to Thailand with Jenson.

To obtain money to travel to Thailand, &quot;Patterson called Ron, who had returned to ANE, and sold the company the theatrical rights to the clip for what Olson described as a pretty good sum of money.&quot;

Patterson died of Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma in 1972. According to Michael McLeod, Greg Long, and Bill Munns, &quot;A few days before Roger died, he told [Bigfoot-book author Peter] Byrne that in retrospect, ... he [wished he] would have shot the thing and brought out a body instead of a reel of film.&quot; According to Grover Krantz and Robert Pyle, years later, Patterson and Gimlin both agreed they should have tried to shoot the creature, both for financial gain and to silence naysayers.

In 1995, almost three decades after the Patterson–Gimlin filming, Greg Long, a technical writer for a technology firm who had a hobby of investigating and writing about Northwest mysteries, started years of interviewing people who knew Patterson, some of whom described him as a liar and a conman.
* &quot;Marvin&quot; (pseudonym), Jerry Lee Merritt, Pat Mason, Glen Koelling, and Bob Swanson suffered financially from their dealings with him, as well as 21 small local creditors who sued Patterson via a collection agency.
* Vilma Radford claimed Patterson never repaid a loan made to him for a Bigfoot movie Roger was planning. Radford had corroborative evidence: a $700 promissory note &quot;for expenses in connection with filming of &#x27;Bigfoot: America&#x27;s Abominable Snowman. Patterson had agreed to repay her $850, plus 5 percent of any profits from the movie.
* In 1974, Bob Gimlin, with René Dahinden&#x27;s financial assistance, sued DeAtley and Patterson&#x27;s widow, Patricia, claiming he had not received his one-third share of the film&#x27;s proceeds. He won his case in 1976.

==Legal status==
Greg Long reports that a 1978 legal &quot;settlement gave Dahinden controlling rights—51 percent of the film footage, 51 percent of video cassette rights, and 100 percent of all 952 frames of the footage. Patty Patterson had 100 percent of all TV rights and 49 percent rights in the film footage. Dahinden had ... bought out Gimlin, who himself had received nothing from Patterson; and Mason and Radford, promised part of the profits by Patterson, had nothing to show for their investment or efforts.&quot; The film is in the public domain in the United States, as it was published without a copyright notice; between 1964 and 1977 all works in the United States required such a notice or they would enter the public domain.

==Ownership of the physical films==

===First reel===
The whereabouts of the original is unknown, although there are several speculations as to what happened to it.
* Patterson had ceded ownership of the original to American National Enterprises, which went bankrupt a few years after his death in 1972. Thereafter, Greg Long writes, &quot;Peregrine Entertainment bought the company. Then Peregrine was bought by Century Group of Los Angeles. When Century Group went bankrupt in 1996, Byrne rushed to Deerfield Beach, Florida, where an accountant was auctioning off the company&#x27;s assets to pay creditors. The company&#x27;s films were in storage in Los Angeles, but a search failed to turn up the Patterson footage.&quot;
* In 2008, Chris Murphy thought a Florida lawyer might have the film, not realizing until later that the lawyer had contacted the Los Angeles storage company that held it, and that it had responded that the film was not in the location the lawyer&#x27;s records indicated.
* Bill Munns writes that it was &quot;last seen by researchers René Dahinden and Bruce Bonney in 1980, when René convinced the film vault [in Southern California] holding it to release it to him&quot;. He made Cibachrome images from it. Sometime between then and 1996, the film went missing from its numbered location in the vault.

At least seven copies were made of the original film.

Bill Munns listed four other missing reels of derivative works that would be helpful to film analysts.

===Second reel===
The second reel, showing Patterson and Gimlin making and displaying plaster casts of some footprints, was not shown in conjunction with the first reel at Al DeAtley&#x27;s house, according to those who were there. Chris Murphy wrote, &quot;I believe the screening of this roll at the University of British Columbia on October 26, 1967, was the first and last major screening.&quot; It has subsequently been lost. John Green suspects that Al DeAtley has it.

A ten-foot strip from that reel, or from a copy of that reel, from which still images were taken by Chris Murphy, still exists, but it, too, has gone missing.

==Filming speed==
One factor that complicates discussion of the Patterson film is that Patterson said he normally filmed at 24 frames per second, but in his haste to capture the Bigfoot on film, he did not note the camera&#x27;s setting. His Cine-Kodak K-100 camera had markings on its continuously variable dial at 16, 24, 32, 48, and 64 frames per second, but no click-stops, and was capable of filming at any frame speed within this range. Grover Krantz wrote, &quot;Patterson clearly told John Green that he found, after the filming, that the camera was set on 18 frames per second (fps). ... &quot; It has been suggested that Patterson simply misread &quot;16&quot; as &quot;18&quot;.
* &quot;Dr. D.W. Grieve, an anatomist with expertise in human biomechanics ... evaluated the various possibilities&quot; regarding film speed and did not come to a conclusion between them. He &quot;confessed to being perplexed and unsettled&quot; by &quot;the tangible possibility that it [the film subject] was real&quot;.
* John Napier, a primatologist, claimed that &quot;if the movie was filmed at 24 frame/s then the creature&#x27;s walk cannot be distinguished from a normal human walk. If it was filmed at 16 or 18 frame/s, there are a number of important respects in which it is quite unlike man&#x27;s gait.&quot; Napier, who published before Dahinden and Krantz, contended it was &quot;likely that Patterson would have used 24 frame/s&quot; because it &quot;is best suited to TV transmission,&quot; while conceding that &quot;this is entirely speculative.&quot;
* Krantz argued, on the basis of an analysis by Igor Bourtsev, that since Patterson&#x27;s height is known (), a reasonable calculation can be made of his pace. This running pace can be synchronized with the regular bounces in the initial jumpy portions of the film that were caused by each fast step Patterson took to approach the creature. On the basis of this analysis, Krantz argued that a speed of 24 frames per second can be quickly dismissed and that &quot;[we] may safely rule out 16 frames per second and accept the speed of 18.&quot;
* René Dahinden stated that &quot;the footage of the horses prior to the Bigfoot film looks jerky and unnatural when projected at 24 frame/s.&quot; And Dahinden experimented at the film site by having people walk rapidly over the creature&#x27;s path and reported: &quot;None of us ... could walk that distance in 40 seconds [952 frames / 24 frame/s = 39.6 s], ... so I eliminated 24 frame/s.&quot;
* Bill Munns wrote, &quot;One researcher, Bill Miller, found technical data from a Kodak technician that stated the K-100 cameras were tweaked so even when the dial is set to 16 fps, the camera actually runs at 18 fps. ... I have nine K-100 cameras now. ... I tried it on one camera, and got 18 fps, but the rest still need testing [and all with &quot;film running through the camera&quot;].&quot;

==Analysis==
The Patterson–Gimlin film has seen relatively little interest from mainstream scientists. Statements of scientists who viewed the film at a screening, or who conducted a study, are reprinted in Chris Murphy&#x27;s &quot;Bigfoot Film Journal&quot;. Typical objections include: Neither humans nor chimpanzees have hairy breasts as does the figure in the film, and Napier has noted that a sagittal crest is &quot;only very occasionally seen, to an insignificant extent, in chimpanzees females&quot;. Critics have argued these features are evidence against authenticity. Krantz countered the latter point, saying &quot;a sagittal crest ... is a consequence of absolute size alone.&quot;

As anthropologist David Daegling writes, &quot;[t]he skeptics have not felt compelled to offer much of a detailed argument against the film; the burden of proof, rightly enough, should lie with the advocates.&quot; Yet, without a detailed argument against authenticity, Daegling notes that &quot;the film has not gone away.&quot; Similarly, Krantz argues that of the many opinions offered about the Patterson film, &quot;[o]nly a few of these opinions are based on technical expertise and careful study of the film itself.&quot;

Regarding the quality of the film, second-generation copies or copies from TV and DVD productions are inferior to first-generation copies. Many early frames are blurry due to camera shake, and the quality of subsequent frames varies for the same reason. Stabilization of the film (e.g., by M. K. Davis) to counter the effect of camera shake has improved viewers&#x27; ability to analyze it. Regarding &quot;graininess,&quot; Bill Munns writes, &quot;Based on transparencies taken off the camera original, ... the PGF original is as fine grain as any color 16mm film can achieve.&quot; He adds that graininess increases as images are magnified.

===Scientific studies===

====Bernard Heuvelmans====
Bernard Heuvelmans—a zoologist and the so-called &quot;father of cryptozoology&quot;—thought the creature in the Patterson film was a suited human. He objected to the film subject&#x27;s hair-flow pattern as being too uniform; to the hair on the breasts as not being like a primate; to its buttocks as being insufficiently separated; and to its too-calm retreat from the pursuing men.

====John Napier====
Prominent primate expert John Napier (one-time director of the Smithsonian&#x27;s Primate Biology Program) was one of the few mainstream scientists not only to critique the Patterson–Gimlin film but also to study then-available Bigfoot evidence in a generally sympathetic manner, in his 1973 book, &quot;Bigfoot: The Sasquatch and Yeti in Myth and Reality&quot;.

Napier conceded the likelihood of Bigfoot as a real creature, stating, &quot;I am convinced that Sasquatch exists.&quot; But he argued against the film being genuine: &quot;There is little doubt that the scientific evidence taken collectively points to a hoax of some kind. The creature shown in the film does not stand up well to functional analysis.&quot; Napier gives several reasons for his and others&#x27; skepticism that are commonly raised, but apparently his main reasons are original with him. First, the length of &quot;the footprints are totally at variance with its calculated height&quot;. Second, the footprints are of the &quot;hourglass&quot; type, which he is suspicious of. (In response, Barbara Wasson criticized Napier&#x27;s logic at length.)

He adds, &quot;I could not see the zipper; and I still can&#x27;t. There I think we must leave the matter. Perhaps it was a man dressed up in a monkey-skin; if so it was a brilliantly executed hoax and the unknown perpetrator will take his place with the great hoaxers of the world. Perhaps it was the first film of a new type of hominid, quite unknown to science, in which case Roger Patterson deserves to rank with Dubois, the discoverer of &quot;Pithecanthropus erectus&quot;, or Raymond Dart of Johannesburg, the man who introduced the world to its immediate human ancestor, &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot;.&quot;

The skeptical views of Grieve and Napier are summarized favorably by Kenneth Wylie (and those of Bayanov and Donskoy negatively) in Appendix A of his 1980 book, &quot;Bigfoot: A Personal Inquiry into a Phenomenon&quot;.

====Esteban Sarmiento====
Esteban Sarmiento is a specialist in physical anthropology at the American Museum of Natural History. He has 25 years of experience with great apes in the wild. He writes, &quot;I did find some inconsistencies in appearance and behavior that might suggest a fake ... but nothing that conclusively shows that this is the case.&quot; His most original criticism is this: &quot;The plantar surface of the feet is decidedly pale, but the palm of the hand seems to be dark. There is no mammal I know of in which the plantar sole differs so drastically in color from the palm.&quot; His most controversial statements are these: &quot;The gluteals, although large, fail to show a humanlike cleft (or crack).&quot; &quot;Body proportions: ... In all of the above relative values, bigfoot is well within the human range and differs markedly from any living ape and from the &#x27;australopithecine&#x27; fossils.&quot; (E.g., the IM index is in the normal human range.) And: &quot;I estimate bigfoot&#x27;s weight to be between 190 and 240 lbs[].&quot;

====David J. Daegling and Daniel O. Schmitt====
When anthropologists David J. Daegling of the University of Florida and Daniel O. Schmitt examined the film, they concluded it was impossible to conclusively determine whether the subject in the film is nonhuman, and additionally argued that flaws in the studies by Krantz and others invalidated their claims. Daegling and Schmitt noted problems of uncertainties in the subject and camera positions, camera movement, poor image quality, and artifacts of the subject. They concluded: &quot;Based on our analysis of gait and problems inherent in estimating subject dimensions, it is our opinion that it is not possible to evaluate the identity of the film subject with any confidence.&quot;

Daegling has asserted that the creature&#x27;s odd walk could be replicated: &quot;Supposed peculiarities of subject speed, stride length, and posture are all reproducible by a human being employing this type of locomotion [a &quot;compliant gait&quot;].&quot;

Daegling notes that in 1967, movie and television special effects were primitive compared to the more sophisticated effects in later decades, and allows that if the Patterson film depicts a man in a suit that &quot;it is not unreasonable to suggest that it is better than some of the tackier monster outfits that got thrown together for television at that time.&quot;

====Jessica Rose and James Gamble====
Jessica Rose and James Gamble are authors of &quot;the definitive text on human gait&quot;, &quot;Human Walking&quot;. They operate the Motion and Gait Analysis Lab at Stanford University. They conducted a high-tech human-replication attempt of &quot;Patty&#x27;s&quot; gait, in cooperation with Jeff Meldrum. Rose was certain their subject had matched Patty&#x27;s gait, while Gamble was not quite as sure. Meldrum was impressed and acknowledged that &quot;some aspects&quot; of the creature&#x27;s walk had been replicated, but not all. The narrator said, &quot;even the experts can see the gait test could not replicate all parameters of the gait.&quot; It was shown in an episode of the Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Best Evidence&quot; series.

====Cliff Crook and Chris Murphy====
A computerized visual analysis of the video conducted by Cliff Crook, who once devoted rooms to sasquatch memorabilia in his home in Bothell, Washington, and Chris Murphy, a Canadian Bigfoot buff from Vancouver, British Columbia, was released in January 1999 and exposed an object which appeared to be the suit&#x27;s zip-fastener. Zooming in on four magnified frames of the 16 mm footage video exposed what appeared to be tracings of a bell-shaped fastener on the creature&#x27;s waist area, presumably used to hold a person&#x27;s suit together. Since both Crook and Murphy were previously staunch supporters of the video&#x27;s authenticity, Associated Press journalist John W. Humbell noted &quot;Longtime enthusiasts smell a deserter.&quot;

===Other analysts===

====Nike researcher Gordon Valient====
Krantz also showed the film to Gordon Valient, a researcher for Nike shoes, who he says &quot;made some rather useful observations about some rather unhuman movements he could see&quot;.

====&quot;MonsterQuest&quot;====
A first-season episode of &quot;MonsterQuest&quot; focuses on the Bigfoot phenomenon. One pair of scientists, Jurgen Konczak (Director, Human Sensorimotor Control Laboratory, University of Minnesota) and Esteban Sarmiento, attempts and fails to get a mime outfitted with LEDs on his joints to mimic the Patterson Bigfoot&#x27;s gait. A second pair, Daris Swindler and Owen Caddy, employs digital enhancement and observes facial movements, such as moving eyelids, lips that compress like an upset chimp&#x27;s, and a mouth that is lower than it appears, due to a false-lip anomaly like that of a chimp&#x27;s. The episode concludes, &quot;the new findings are intriguing but inconclusive, until a body is found.&quot;

===Film industry personnel===

====Movie production companies&#x27; executives====
* Dale Sheets and Universal Studios. Patterson, Gimlin, and DeAtley screened the film for Dale Sheets, head of the Documentary Film Department, and unnamed technicians &quot;in the special effects department at Universal Studios in Hollywood ... Their conclusion was: &#x27;We could try (faking it), but we would have to create a completely new system of artificial muscles and find an actor who could be trained to walk like that. It might be done, but we would have to say that it would be almost impossible. A more moderate version of their opinion was, &quot;if it is [a man in an ape suit], it&#x27;s a very good one—a job that would take a lot of time and money to produce.&quot;
* Disney executive Ken Peterson. Krantz reports that in 1969, John Green (who owned a first-generation copy of the original Patterson film) interviewed Disney executive Ken Peterson, who, after viewing the Patterson film, asserted &quot;that their technicians would not be able to duplicate the film&quot;. Krantz argues that if Disney personnel were unable to duplicate the film, there is little likelihood that Patterson could have done so. Greg Long writes, &quot;Byrne cited his trip to Walt Disney studios in 1972, where Disney&#x27;s chief of animation and four assistants viewed Patterson&#x27;s footage and praised it as a beautiful piece of work although, they said, it must have been shot in a studio. When Byrne told them it had been shot in the woods of Northern California, &#x27;They shook their heads and walked away.

====Bill Munns====
Bill Munns, retired, was a special effects and make-up artist, cameraman, and film editor. He argues that Universal and Disney were not the most knowledgeable studios to consult with. He says that Fox, MGM, and special effects artist Stuart Freeborn in England, &quot;who had just completed his groundbreaking ape suits for &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;&quot;, would have been preferable.

Munns started posting his online analysis of the film in 2009 and summarizing it in the online Munns Report. In 2013 he and Jeff Meldrum co-authored three papers in Meldrum&#x27;s online magazine, &quot;Relict Hominoid Inquiry&quot;. In 2014, Munns self-published &quot;When Roger Met Patty&quot;, a 488-page book incorporating material from those articles that analyses the film and film subject from various perspectives.

He argues the film depicts a non-human animal, not a man in a fur suit. He proposes a new diagnostic test of authenticity, at the armpit: natural concave skin fold vs. artificial vertical crease. Munns&#x27; analysis has been featured in an episode of the History Channel series &quot;MonsterQuest&quot;.

====Other special effects artists====
* Rick Baker. Famed Hollywood creator of Harry (from the movie, &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot;), Rick Baker, told Geraldo Rivera&#x27;s &quot;Now It Can Be Told&quot; show (in 1992) that &quot;it looked like cheap, fake fur,&quot; after seeing the subject in Patterson&#x27;s filmstrip. Baker said that John Chambers had &quot;a crappy walkaround suit,&quot; that he sold as &quot;a gag to be played on the guy that shot it [the film]&quot;. Later on, Baker&#x27;s studio stated in a fax, &quot;He no longer believes this [that Chambers made the suit] is true.&quot;
* Ellis Burman. The Guenettes (Robert &amp; Frances) wrote of him, &quot;I also spoke to Ellis Burman of Burman Studios in Hollywood, creators of all kinds of strange creatures, including a fake Bigfoot for a traveling &#x27;pickled punk&#x27; carnival exhibit. Burman denied his company created the Patterson Bigfoot, but did say he could duplicate it—but for more than $10,000 in total costs.&quot;
* John Chambers. Academy Award–winning monster-maker John Chambers is most famous for his innovative flexible masks in &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (1968). In a 1997 interview in a nursing home with Bigfooter Bobbie Short in her nurse&#x27;s uniform, he denied rumors that he had created a costume for the Patterson subject, saying &quot;I&#x27;m good, but not that good.&quot;
:Some time before 1976 the Guenettes reported that, in answer to their questions, &quot;He concluded that if the creature is a man in a suit, then it is no ordinary gorilla suit. It is not something they bought or rented in a store; it would have to be something tailor made. He also felt like it might have been made out of real animal fur.&quot;
* Janos Prohaska. After viewing the Patterson–Gimlin film with John Green, costume designer and ape-suit mime Janos Prohaska (noted for his work in the late-1960s television programs &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Lost in Space&quot;) concluded the film&#x27;s subject looked real to him. When asked if he thought the film was faked, Prohaska replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t think so ... to me it looks very, very real.&quot; If the film was hoaxed, Prohaska thought, it was remarkably realistic and sophisticated, and the best costume he had ever seen, and the only plausible explanation was that someone might have glued false hair &quot;directly to the actor&#x27;s skin&quot;.
:However, film critic David Daegling speculates that the same effect could be had by gluing the hair to a set of tight but expandable, waffle-design long johns.
* Chris Walas. Academy Award-winning &quot;makeup artist Chris [Walas] in the BigfootForums [site] (in 2004) presented a theory that the arching hip line represents the overlap line between a fur costume leggings section and the torso section. ... &quot;
* Stan Winston. Academy Award-winning film special effects supervisor and makeup artist Stan Winston, after viewing the PGF, said &quot;it&#x27;s a guy in a bad hair suit, sorry!&quot; He also added that &quot;if one of my colleagues created this for a movie, he would be out of business.&quot; He went on to comment that the suit in the film could have been made today for &quot;a couple hundred dollars&quot; or &quot;under a thousand, in that day&quot;.
* &quot;Barry Keith&quot; (pen name), &quot;an experienced make-up and costume artist,&quot; accused &quot;the Hollywood costume industry&quot; of making &quot;bravado claims of how easy such an event would be to fake&quot;. He said that their &quot;cheats and shortcuts&quot; are not detectable in &quot;Patty&quot;.

==Hoax allegations==

===Patterson and/or Gimlin===
* Patterson and Gimlin both denied that they had perpetrated a hoax, but in a 1999 telephone interview with television producer Chris Packham for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The X Creatures&quot;, Gimlin said that for some time, &quot;I was &quot;totally&quot; convinced no one could fool me. And of course I&#x27;m an older man now ... and I think there could have been the possibility [of a hoax]. But it would have to be really well planned by Roger [Patterson].&quot;
* Author Greg Long uncovered circumstantial evidence, of varying strength, of footprint hoaxing, and possibly even sighting and photo hoaxing, in the Yakima vicinity by Patterson. Long argues that this means that he faked the film, too.
:(One possible motive for the Yakima fakery would have been to make Bigfoot seem more real to local millionaire Floyd Paxton, with whom he was acquainted and from whom he hoped to obtain funding for an expedition.)
:The film&#x27;s proponents&#x27; position is that what is seen in the film is unfakable—especially not by a costume beginner like Patterson. For instance, most of Bill Munns&#x27; book makes detailed examinations of film features that he argues could not have been created with 1967 special effects technology. He filmed recreation attempts of his own that failed. Daniel Perez, writing in 1992, asserted &quot;If the film is in fact a fake, a costumed man or a machine, surely science could duplicate the film with ease. Twenty-five years later, no one has come close.&quot; He later asserted, &quot;It has never been convincingly replicated. To any thinking person, that should speak volumes.&quot;
:Greg Long&#x27;s response was, &quot;The film they have just isn&#x27;t going to do it. I&#x27;m sorry. That&#x27;s not evidence.&quot;
* David Daegling, anthropologist, writes that the &quot;more cynical skeptics&quot; see Patterson&#x27;s luck as &quot;more than a little suspicious: He sets out to make a Bigfoot documentary, then almost literally stumbles across a Bigfoot.&quot; Daegling, however, offers the benefit of the doubt, noting that Patterson&#x27;s reasoning is sound: In seeking something elusive, he went to where it had been reported. Bluff Creek had also been the site of well-known Bigfoot hoaxer Ray Wallace&#x27;s activities in 1958. In Patterson&#x27;s book, he mentions meeting with Wallace once. Later, Daegling cites certain features in the film and the storyline as suspicious.
* Krantz thought Patterson might have perpetrated such a hoax, given the opportunity and resources. (Roger was an accomplished 2-D artist whose drawings and painting of horses and other wildlife showed a detailed understanding of musculature and anatomy.) But he also argued that Patterson had &quot;nowhere near the knowledge or facilities to do so—nor for that matter, did anyone else ... When I talked about some of the more technical details of biomechanics, he (Patterson) showed the familiar blank look of a student who had lost the drift of the explanation, but was still trying hard to pay attention. Yet he must have known all these details to create a hoax. For instance, he could see the anterior position of the front of the shin, but how that related to foot leverage was quite beyond him.&quot;
* Peter Byrne, who interviewed Patterson and Gimlin many times, wrote, &quot;both men lacked, primarily, the intellectual capacity essential to the production of a hoax ... termed a masterpiece.&quot; Similarly, Daegling writes that &quot;Most acquaintances of Patterson volunteered that neither he nor Gimlin were clever enough to put something that detailed together.&quot;

===Philip Morris===
In 2002, Philip Morris, owner of Morris Costumes (a North Carolina–based company offering costumes, props and stage products) claimed that he made a gorilla costume that was used in the Patterson film. Morris says he discussed his role in the hoax &quot;at costume conventions, lectures, [and] magician conventions&quot; in the 1980s, but first addressed the public at large on August 16, 2002, on Charlotte, North Carolina, radio station WBT. His story was also printed in &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot;. Morris claims he was reluctant to expose the hoax earlier for fear of harming his business: giving away a performer&#x27;s secrets, he said, would be widely regarded as disreputable.

Morris said that he sold an ape suit to Patterson via mail order in 1967, thinking it was going to be used in what Patterson described as a &quot;prank&quot;. (Ordinarily the gorilla suits he sold were used for a popular sideshow routine that depicted an attractive woman, supposedly from some far-flung corner of the globe, being altered by a sorcerer or scientist into a gorilla or otherwise apelike monster.) After the initial sale, Morris said that Patterson telephoned him asking how to make the &quot;shoulders more massive&quot; and the &quot;arms longer&quot;. Morris says he suggested that whoever wore the suit should wear football shoulder pads and hold sticks in his hands within the suit.

As for the creature&#x27;s walk, Morris said:
The Bigfoot researchers say that no human can walk that way in the film. Oh, yes they can! When you&#x27;re wearing long clown&#x27;s feet, you can&#x27;t place the ball of your foot down first. You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll stumble. Another thing, when you put on the gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you&#x27;ve got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are in the way of the jaw. That&#x27;s why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.
Morris&#x27; wife and business partner Amy had vouched for her husband and claims to have helped frame the suit. Morris offered no evidence apart from his own testimony to support his account, the most conspicuous shortcoming being the absence of a gorilla suit or documentation that would match the detail evidenced in the film and could have been produced in 1967.

A re-creation of the PGF was undertaken on October 6, 2004, at &quot;Cow Camp,&quot; near Rimrock Lake, a location west of Yakima. This was six months after the publication of Long&#x27;s book and 11 months after Long had first contacted Morris. Bigfooter Daniel Perez wrote, &quot;&quot;National Geographic&#x27;s&quot; [producer] Noel Dockster ... noted the suit used in the re-creation ... was in no way similar to what was depicted in the P–G film.&quot;

Morris would not consent to release the video to &quot;National Geographic&quot;, the re-creation&#x27;s sponsor, claiming he had not had adequate time to prepare and that the month was in the middle of his busy season.

===Bob Heironimus===
Bob Heironimus claims to have been the figure depicted in the Patterson film. Heironimus says he had not previously publicly discussed his role in the hoax because he hoped to be paid eventually and was afraid of being convicted of fraud had he confessed. After speaking with his lawyer he was told that since he had not been paid for his involvement in the hoax, he could not be held accountable.

A month after watching the December 28, 1998, Fox-television special &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Hoaxes: Secrets Finally Revealed?&quot;, he went public, via a January 30 press release by his lawyer, Barry Woodard, in a Yakima newspaper story. He stated, &quot;I&#x27;m telling the truth. I&#x27;m tired after thirty-seven years.&quot; Five days later, a second newspaper story reported that his &quot;lawyer&#x27;s office has been inundated with calls from media outlets. ... &#x27;We&#x27;re just sort of waiting for the dust to settle,&#x27; he said, explaining he and his client are evaluating offers.&quot; He also said, &quot;We anticipate that we will be telling the full story to somebody rather quickly.&quot;

Heironimus&#x27;s name was first publicly revealed, and his allegations first publicly detailed, five years later, in Greg Long&#x27;s book, &quot;The Making of Bigfoot&quot;, which includes testimony that corroborates Heironimus&#x27; claims:
* Heironimus&#x27;s relatives (his mother Opal and nephew John Miller) claim to have seen an ape suit in Heironimus&#x27; car. Opal said she saw the suit two days after the film was shot.
* Russ Bohannon, a longtime friend, says that Heironimus revealed the hoax privately in 1968 or 1969.
* Bernard Hammermeister, another longtime friend, said he was shown an ape suit in Heironimus&#x27; car. No date was given by Long for Hammermeister&#x27;s observation, but it apparently came well after the relatives&#x27; observation, as implied by the word &quot;still&quot; in the justification Heironimus gave Hammermeister for requesting his silence: &quot;There was still supposed to be a payola on this thing, and he didn&#x27;t have it.&quot;

Long argues that the suit Morris says he sold to Patterson was the same suit Heironimus claims to have worn in the Patterson film. However, Long quotes Heironimus and Morris describing different ape suits in many respects. Among the notable differences are:
* Suit Material: Horsehide vs. Dynel. Heironimus says he was told by his brother Howard that Patterson claimed he manufactured the suit from horsehide. When Long asked how heavy the suit was, Bob replied, &quot;It weighed maybe . ... Horsehide would be heavy.&quot; Bob added, &quot;It stunk. Roger skinned out a dead, red horse.&quot;

:But Morris reports that the suit was made of Dynel, a lighter-weight synthetic material with little or no odor. Morris said that it was his &quot;standard suit that we sold to all our customers&quot; that cost $435 (cheaper than the competition).

:Another contrast is that Howard reported that the horsehide was a &quot;real dark brown&quot; and Long writes that Morris &quot;was using brown Dynel in 1967&quot;. But Morris wouldn&#x27;t have wanted a &quot;real dark&quot; brown color, as he chose brown to contrast against the black background of the girl-to-gorilla illusion.
* Suit: Top-and-Trousers vs. a Back-Zipped Onesie. Heironimus described the suit as having no metal pieces and an upper &quot;torso part&quot; that he donned &quot;like putting on a T-shirt&quot;. At Bluff Creek he put on &quot;the top&quot;. Asked about the &quot;bottom portion,&quot; he guessed it was cinched with a drawstring.
* Hands and Feet: Suit-Attached vs. Separate. Heironimus described the suit as having hands and feet that were attached to the arms and legs.

:But Morris made a suit whose hands and feet were separate pieces. Long speculates that Patterson riveted or glued these parts to the suit, but offers no evidence to support this idea. If Patterson had done so, he must have done it before Heironimus did his test fitting and walk (because Heironimus describes a three-piece suit—head, torso, and legs, omitting separate hands and feet)—i.e., without adjusting their location to his dimensions. And Heironimus never described being measured beforehand. Heironimus has altered several details around the boots several times over the years, stating that the boots as &quot;hip boots that go up to your waist&quot;, but later stated they were &quot;irrigation boots that go up to the knees&quot;.

Long speculates that Patterson modified the costume, but only by attaching Morris&#x27;s loose hands and feet to the costume, and by replacing Morris&#x27;s mask.

Some film proponents say that Heironimus&#x27; arms are too short to match that of a Bigfoot and that he was a few inches shorter than the creature on the film (up to shorter).

:But Heironimus said that he wore football shoulder pads, which might explain why the shoulders and arms appear to be out of proportion to the rest of the body. However, Heironimus disclaimed the use of arm-extending sticks in his costume and said that he wore &quot;gloves, a little bit longer than my actual hands were . ... &quot;

Polygraph tests regarding their claims have been passed by both Heironimus and Patterson. It should also be noted that Heironimus had previously failed the test three times, only passing on his fourth attempt. Additionally, Edward Gelb, the man who administered Heironimus&#x27;s successful polygraph attempt, was later revealed to have faked his credentials, including his diploma and PhD, causing him to be widely considered to be a fraud.

===Ray Wallace===
After the death of Ray Wallace in 2002, following a request by Loren Coleman to &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; reporter Bob Young to investigate, the family of Wallace went public with claims that he had started the Bigfoot phenomenon with fake footprints (made from a wooden foot-shaped cutout) left in Californian sites in 1958.
* Mark Chorvinsky, editor of &quot;Strange&quot; magazine, promoted Wallace&#x27;s claim that he tipped off Patterson exactly where to look for a Bigfoot. Chorvinsky wrote, &quot;&#x27;Roger Patterson came [over] dozens of times pumping me on this Bigfoot,&#x27; Ray Wallace explained to researcher Dennis Pilchis in 1982. &#x27;I felt sorry for Roger Patterson. He told me he had cancer of the lymph glands and he was desperately broke and he wanted to try to get something where he could have a little income. Well, he went down there exactly where I told him. I told him, &#x27;You go down there and hang around on that bank. Stay up there and watch that spot. David Daegling summarized Chorvinsky&#x27;s argument and concluded that Wallace &quot;had a degree of involvement&quot; with the Patterson–Gimlin film, and that this gave grounds for suspicion of it.
* Loren Coleman has written that Patterson was an early Bigfoot investigator, and that it was only natural that he sought out and interviewed older Bigfoot-event principals, which included Wallace, because of the 1958 Bluff Creek track incidents. Coleman has asserted that Wallace had nothing to do with Patterson&#x27;s footage in 1967, and has argued in an analysis of the media treatment of the death of Wallace that the international media inappropriately confused the Wallace films of the 1970s with the Patterson–Gimlin 1967 film.
* Meldrum has written extensively about Wallace, his allegations (continued by his family after his death), and the significant problems with them in his book, &quot;Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science&quot;.

===Books on the subject===
The major hoax allegations are summarized and criticized in:
* Two of Christopher Murphy&#x27;s books.
* Loren Coleman&#x27;s &quot;Bigfoot!: The True Story of Apes in America&quot;.
* David Daegling&#x27;s &quot;Bigfoot Exposed.&quot;

<text>Ambroise Paul Toussaint Jules Valéry (; 30 October 1871 – 20 July 1945) was a French poet, essayist, and philosopher. In addition to his poetry and fiction (drama and dialogues), his interests included aphorisms on art, history, letters, music, and current events. Valéry was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 12 different years.

==Biography==
Valéry was born to a Corsican father and Genoese-Istrian mother in Sète, a town on the Mediterranean coast of the Hérault, but he was raised in Montpellier, a larger urban center close by. After a traditional Roman Catholic education, he studied law at university and then resided in Paris for most of the remainder of his life, where he was, for a while, part of the circle of Stéphane Mallarmé.

In 1900, he married Jeannine Gobillard, a friend of Stéphane Mallarmé&#x27;s family, who was also a niece of the painter Berthe Morisot. The wedding was a double ceremony in which the bride&#x27;s cousin, Berthe Morisot&#x27;s daughter, Julie Manet, married the painter Ernest Rouart. Valéry and Gobillard had three children: Claude, Agathe and François.

Valéry served as a juror with Florence Meyer Blumenthal in awarding the Prix Blumenthal, a grant given between 1919 and 1954 to young French painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians.

Though his earliest publications date from his mid-twenties, Valéry did not become a full-time writer until he was fifty. Valéry had briefly earned his living at the Ministry of War, before assuming a relatively flexible post as private secretary to the increasingly impaired Edouard Lebey, a former chief executive of the Havas news agency (later renamed &quot;Agence France-Presse&quot;). He held this position for over twenty years, until Lebey&#x27;s death in 1922.

In 1920, he began a tumultuous affair with a fellow poet, Catherine Pozzi, which lasted for eight years.
After his election to the in 1925, Valéry became a tireless public speaker and intellectual figure in French society, touring Europe and giving lectures on cultural and social issues as well as assuming a number of official positions eagerly offered to him by an admiring French nation. He represented France on cultural matters at the League of Nations, and he served on several of its committees, including the sub-committee on Arts and Letters of the Committee on Intellectual Cooperation. The English-language collection &quot;The Outlook for Intelligence&quot; (1989) contains translations of a dozen essays related to these activities.

In 1931, he founded the Collège International de Cannes, a private institution teaching French language and civilization. The Collège is still operating today, offering professional courses for native speakers (for educational certification, law and business) as well as courses for foreign students.

He gave the keynote address at the 1932 German national celebration of the 100th anniversary of the death of Johann Wolfgang Goethe. This was a fitting choice, as Valéry shared Goethe&#x27;s fascination with science (specifically, biology and optics).

In addition to his activities as a member of the , he was also a member of the Academy of Sciences of Lisbon, and of the &quot;Front national des Ecrivains&quot;. In 1937, he was appointed chief executive of what later became the University of Nice. He was the inaugural holder of the Chair of Poetics at the .

During World War II, the Vichy regime stripped him of some of these jobs and distinctions because of his quiet refusal to collaborate with Vichy and the German occupation, but Valéry continued, throughout these troubled years, to publish and to be active in French cultural life, especially as a member of the .

Valéry was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature twelve times. It is believed that the Swedish Academy intended to award Valéry the prize in 1945, had he not died that year.

Valéry died in Paris in July 1945. He is buried in the cemetery of his native town, Sète, the same cemetery celebrated in his famous poem &quot;Le Cimetière marin&quot;.

==Work==

===The great silence===
Valéry is best known as a poet, and he is sometimes considered to be the last of the French symbolists. However, he published fewer than a hundred poems, and none of them drew much attention. On the night of 4 October 1892, during a heavy storm, Paul Valéry underwent an existential crisis, an event that made a huge impact on his writing career. Eventually, around 1898, he quit writing altogether, publishing not a word for nearly twenty years. This hiatus was in part due to the death of his mentor, Stéphane Mallarmé. When, in 1917, he finally broke his &#x27;great silence&#x27; with the publication of &quot;La Jeune Parque&quot;, he was forty-six years of age.

===&quot;La Jeune Parque&quot;===
This obscure, but sublimely musical, masterpiece, of 512 alexandrine lines in rhyming couplets, had taken him four years to complete, and it immediately secured his fame. With &quot;Le Cimetière marin&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Ébauche d&#x27;un serpent,&quot; it is often considered one of the greatest French poems of the twentieth century.

The title was chosen late in the poem&#x27;s gestation; it refers to the youngest of the three &quot;Parcae&quot; (the minor Roman deities also called &quot;The Fates&quot;), though for some readers the connection with that mythological figure is tenuous and problematic.

The poem is written in the first person, and is the soliloquy of a young woman contemplating life and death, engagement and withdrawal, love and estrangement, in a setting dominated by the sea, the sky, stars, rocky cliffs, and the rising sun. However, it is also possible to read the poem as an allegory on the way fate moves human affairs or as an attempt to comprehend the horrific violence in Europe at the time of the poem&#x27;s composition. The poem is not about World War I, but it does try to address the relationships between destruction and beauty, and, in this sense, it resonates with ancient Greek meditations on these matters, especially in the plays of Sophocles and Aeschylus. There are, therefore, evident links with &quot;le Cimetière marin&quot;, which is also a seaside meditation on comparably large themes.

===Other works===
Before &quot;la Jeune Parque&quot;, Valéry&#x27;s only publications of note were dialogues, articles, some poems, and a study of Leonardo da Vinci. In 1920 and 1922, he published two slim collections of verses. The first, &quot;Album des vers anciens&quot; (Album of old verses), was a revision of early but beautifully wrought smaller poems, some of which had been published individually before 1900. The second, &quot;Charmes&quot; (from the Latin &quot;carmina&quot;, meaning &quot;songs&quot; and also &quot;incantations&quot;), further confirmed his reputation as a major French poet. The collection includes &quot;le Cimetière marin&quot;, and many smaller poems with diverse structures.

===Technique===
Valéry&#x27;s technique is quite orthodox in its essentials. His verse rhymes and scans in conventional ways, and it has much in common with the work of Mallarmé. His poem &quot;Palme&quot; inspired James Merrill&#x27;s celebrated 1974 poem &quot;Lost in Translation,&quot; and his cerebral lyricism also influenced American poet Edgar Bowers.

===Prose works===
Valéry described his “true oeuvre” to be prose, and he filled more than 28,000 notebook pages over his lifetime. His far more ample prose writings, peppered with many aphorisms and &quot;bons mots&quot;, reveal a skeptical outlook on human nature, verging on the cynical. His view of state power was broadly liberal insofar as he believed that state power and infringements on the individual should be severely limited. Although he had flirted with nationalist ideas during the 1890s, he moved away from them by 1899, and believed that European culture owed its greatness to the ethnic diversity and universalism of the Roman Empire. He denounced the myth of &quot;racial purity&quot; and argued that such purity, if it existed, would only lead to stagnation—thus the mixing of races was necessary for progress and cultural development. In &quot;America as a Projection of the European Mind&quot;, Valéry remarked that whenever he despaired about Europe&#x27;s situation, he could &quot;restore some degree of hope only by thinking of
the New World&quot; and mused on the &quot;happy variations&quot; which could result from European &quot;aesthetic ideas filtering into the powerful character of native Mexican art.&quot;

Raymond Poincaré, Louis de Broglie, André Gide, Henri Bergson, and Albert Einstein all respected Valéry&#x27;s thinking and became friendly correspondents. Valéry was often asked to write articles on topics not of his choosing; the resulting intellectual journalism was collected in five volumes titled &quot;Variétés&quot;.

===The notebooks===
Valéry&#x27;s most striking achievement is perhaps his monumental intellectual diary, called the &quot;Cahiers&quot; (Notebooks). Early every morning of his adult life, he contributed something to the &quot;Cahiers&quot;, prompting him to write: &quot;Having dedicated those hours to the life of the mind, I thereby earn the right to be stupid for the rest of the day.&quot;

The subjects of his &quot;Cahiers&quot; entries often were, surprisingly, reflections on science and mathematics. In fact, arcane topics in these domains appear to have commanded far more of his considered attention than his celebrated poetry. The &quot;Cahiers&quot; also contain the first drafts of many aphorisms he later included in his books. To date, the &quot;Cahiers&quot; have been published in their entirety only as photostatic reproductions, and only since 1980 have they begun to receive scholarly scrutiny. The &quot;Cahiers&quot; have been translated into English in five volumes published by Peter Lang with the title &quot;Cahiers/Notebooks&quot;.

In recent decades Valéry&#x27;s thought has been considered a touchstone in the field of constructivist epistemology, as noted, for instance, by Jean-Louis Le Moigne in his description of constructivist history.

==In other literature==

One of three epigraphs in Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s novel &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; is from Valéry&#x27;s Writing at the Yalu River (1895):
&quot;Your ideas are terrifying and your hearts are faint. Your acts of pity and cruelty are absurd, committed with no calm, as if they were irresistible. Finally, you fear blood more and more. Blood and time&quot;.

In the book &quot;El laberinto de la soledad&quot; from Octavio Paz there are three verses of one of Valéry&#x27;s poems: 
&lt;poem&gt;
Je pense, sur le bord doré de l’univers
A ce gout de périr qui prend la Pythonisse
En qui mugit l’espoir que le monde finisse.
&lt;/poem&gt;In Ray Bradbury’s &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, the book-burning fire chief Beatty quotes Valery: The folly of mistaking a paradox for a discovery, a metaphor for a proof, a torrent of verbiage for a spring of capital truths, and oneself for an oracle, is inborn in us.From Introduction à la méthode de Léonard de Vinci.

==In popular culture==
Oscar-winning Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s 2013 film &quot;The Wind Rises&quot; and the Japanese novel of the same name (on which the film was partially based) take their title from Valéry&#x27;s verse &quot;Le vent se lève... il faut tenter de vivre !&quot; (&quot;The wind rises… We must try to live!&quot;) in the poem &quot;Le Cimetière marin&quot; (&quot;The Graveyard by the Sea&quot;). The same quote is used in the closing sentences of Anthony Burgess&#x27;s 1962 novel &quot;The Wanting Seed&quot;. &quot;Le Cimetière marin&quot; is also quoted in the French comic &quot;Le concombre masqué: Comment devenir maître du monde?&quot;, authored by Mandryka and published in 1980.

<doc id="23528" wikidata="Q486748" url="?curid=23528" title="Pianist">
<text>A pianist ( , ) is a musician who plays the piano. A pianist&#x27;s repertoire may include music from a diverse variety of styles, such as traditional classical music, jazz, blues, and popular music, including rock and roll. Most pianists can, to an extent, easily play other keyboard instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta, and the organ.

==Pianists past and present==
Contemporary classical pianists focus on dedicating their careers to performing, recording, teaching, researching, and continually adding new compositions to their repertoire. In contrast to their 19th-century counterparts, they typically do not engage in the composition or transcription of music. While some classical pianists may specialize in accompaniment and chamber music, a smaller number opt for full-time solo careers.

==Classical ==

Mozart could be considered the first concert pianist, as he performed widely on the piano. Composers Beethoven and Clementi from the Classical era were also famed for their playing, as were, from the Romantic era, Liszt, Brahms, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Rachmaninoff, and Schumann. The Romantic era also saw the emergence of pianists better known for their performances than for composing, such as Clara Schumann and Hans von Bülow.

==Jazz ==
Jazz pianists almost always perform with other musicians. Their playing is more free than that of classical pianists, and they create an air of spontaneity in their performances. They generally do not write down their compositions; improvisation is a significant part of their work. Well known jazz pianists include Bill Evans, Art Tatum, Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, Oscar Peterson, Bud Powell, McCoy Tyner, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, and Brad Mehldau.

==Pop and rock==
Popular pianists might work as live performers (concert, theatre, etc.) or session musicians. Arrangers most likely feel at home with synthesizers and other electronic keyboard instruments. Notable popular pianists include Liberace, who at the height of his fame was one of the highest paid entertainers in the world , as well as Elton John and Billy Joel, so nicknamed &quot;The Piano Man&quot;, others include Richard Clayderman, who is known for his covers of popular tunes and the late Victor Borge, who performed as a comedian.

==Pianists by genre==
A single listing of pianists in all genres would be impractical, given the multitude of musicians noted for their performances on the instrument. Below are links to lists of well-known or influential pianists divided by genres:

==Amateur pianism==

Some people, having received a solid piano training in their youth, decide not to continue their musical careers but choose nonmusical ones. As a result, there are prominent communities of &quot;amateur pianists&quot; all over the world that play at quite a high level and give concerts not to earn money but just for the love of music. The International Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs, held annually in Paris, attracts about one thousand listeners each year and is broadcast on French radio.

Jon Nakamatsu, the Gold Medal winner of the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition for professional pianists in Fort Worth, Texas (1997) was at the moment of his victory technically an amateur: he never attended a music conservatory or majored in music, and worked as a high school German teacher at the time; it was only after the competition that he started pursuing a career as a classical pianist.

The German pianist Davide Martello is known for traveling around conflict zones to play his moving piano. Martello has previously been recognized by the European Parliament for his &quot;outstanding contribution to European cooperation and the promotion of common values&quot;.

<text>A proverb (from ) or an adage is a simple, traditional saying that expresses a perceived truth based on common sense or experience. Proverbs are often metaphorical and are an example of formulaic language. A proverbial phrase or a proverbial expression is a type of a conventional saying similar to proverbs and transmitted by oral tradition. The difference is that a proverb is a fixed expression, while a proverbial phrase permits alterations to fit the grammar of the context. Collectively, they form a genre of folklore.

Some proverbs exist in more than one language because people borrow them from languages and cultures with which they are in contact. In the West, the Bible (including, but not limited to the Book of Proverbs) and medieval Latin (aided by the work of Erasmus) have played a considerable role in distributing proverbs. Not all Biblical proverbs, however, were distributed to the same extent: one scholar has gathered evidence to show that cultures in which the Bible is the major spiritual book contain &quot;between three hundred and five hundred proverbs that stem from the Bible,&quot; whereas another shows that, of the 106 most common and widespread proverbs across Europe, 11 are from the Bible. However, almost every culture has its own unique proverbs.

== Definitions ==
Lord John Russell () observed poetically that a &quot;proverb is the wit of one, and the wisdom of many.&quot; But giving the word &quot;proverb&quot; the sort of definition theorists need has proven to be a difficult task, and although scholars often quote Archer Taylor&#x27;s argument that formulating a scientific &quot;definition of a proverb is too difficult to repay the undertaking... An incommunicable quality tells us this sentence is proverbial and that one is not. Hence no definition will enable us to identify positively a sentence as proverbial,&quot; many students of proverbs have attempted to itemize their essential characteristics.

More constructively, Wolfgang Mieder has proposed the following definition, &quot;A proverb is a short, generally known sentence of the folk which contains wisdom, truth, morals, and traditional views in a metaphorical, fixed, and memorizable form and which is handed down from generation to generation&quot;. To distinguish proverbs from idioms, cliches, etc., Norrick created a table of distinctive features, an abstract tool originally developed for linguistics. Prahlad distinguishes proverbs from some other, closely related types of sayings, &quot;True proverbs must further be distinguished from other types of proverbial speech, e.g. proverbial phrases, Wellerisms, maxims, quotations, and proverbial comparisons.&quot; Based on Persian proverbs, Zolfaghari and Ameri propose the following definition: &quot;A proverb is a short sentence, which is well-known and at times rhythmic, including advice, sage themes and ethnic experiences, comprising simile, metaphor or irony which is well-known among people for its fluent wording, clarity of expression, simplicity, expansiveness and generality and is used either with or without change.&quot;

There are many sayings in English that are commonly referred to as &quot;proverbs&quot;, such as weather sayings. Alan Dundes, however, rejects including such sayings among truly proverbs: &quot;Are weather proverbs proverbs? I would say emphatically &#x27;No!&#x27;&quot; The definition of &quot;proverb&quot; has also changed over the years. For example, the following was labeled &quot;A Yorkshire proverb&quot; in 1883, but would not be categorized as a proverb by most today, &quot;as throng as Throp&#x27;s wife when she hanged herself with a dish-cloth&quot;. The changing of the definition of &quot;proverb&quot; is also noted in Turkish.

In other languages and cultures, the definition of &quot;proverb&quot; also differs from English. In the Chumburung language of Ghana, &quot;&quot;aŋase&quot; are literal proverbs and &quot;akpare&quot; are metaphoric ones&quot;. Among the Bini of Nigeria, there are three words that are used to translate &quot;proverb&quot;: &quot;ere, ivbe&quot;, and &quot;itan&quot;. The first relates to historical events, the second relates to current events, and the third was &quot;linguistic ornamentation in formal discourse&quot;. Among the Balochi of Pakistan and Afghanistan, there is a word &quot;batal&quot; for ordinary proverbs and &quot;bassīttuks&quot; for &quot;proverbs with background stories&quot;.

There are also language communities that combine proverbs and riddles in some sayings, leading some scholars to create the label &quot;proverb riddles&quot;.

Another similar construction is an idiomatic phrase. Sometimes it is difficult to draw a distinction between idiomatic phrase and proverbial expression. In both of them the meaning does not immediately follow from the phrase. The difference is that an idiomatic phrase involves figurative language in its components, while in a proverbial phrase the figurative meaning is the extension of its literal meaning. Some experts classify proverbs and proverbial phrases as types of idioms.

== Examples ==

*A dog is a man&#x27;s best friend
* All that glitters is not gold
* A little learning is a dangerous thing
* A rolling stone gathers no moss
* An apple a day keeps the doctor away
* Don&#x27;t cross the bridge until you come to it
* Don&#x27;t count your chickens before they hatch
* Don&#x27;t put all your eggs in one basket
* Fortune favours the bold
* Garbage in, garbage out
* 
* It ain&#x27;t over till the fat lady sings
* If you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.
* On the Internet, nobody knows you&#x27;re a dog
* The enemy of my enemy is my friend
* Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones
* With great power comes great responsibility
* You can&#x27;t have your cake and eat it

==Sources==
Proverbs come from a variety of sources. Some are, indeed, the result of people pondering and crafting language, such as some by Confucius, Plato, Baltasar Gracián, etc. Others are taken from such diverse sources as poetry, stories, songs, commercials, advertisements, movies, literature, etc. A number of the well known sayings of Jesus, Shakespeare, and others have become proverbs, though they were original at the time of their creation, and many of these sayings were not seen as proverbs when they were first coined. Many proverbs are based on stories, often the end of a story. For example, the proverb &quot;Who will bell the cat?&quot; is from the end of a story about the mice planning how to be safe from the cat.

Some authors have created proverbs in their writings, such as J.R.R. Tolkien, and some of these proverbs have made their way into broader society. Similarly, C. S. Lewis is credited for a proverb regarding a lobster in a pot, which he wrote about in his book series &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot;. In cases like this, deliberately created proverbs for fictional societies have become proverbs in real societies. In a fictional story set in a real society, the movie &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; introduced &quot;Life is like a box of chocolates&quot; into broad society. In at least one case, it appears that a proverb deliberately created by one writer has been naively picked up and used by another who assumed it to be an established Chinese proverb, Ford Madox Ford having picked up a proverb from Ernest Bramah, &quot;It would be hypocrisy to seek for the person of the Sacred Emperor in a Low Tea House.&quot;

The proverb with &quot;a longer history than any other recorded proverb in the world&quot;, going back to &quot;around 1800 BC&quot; is in a Sumerian clay tablet, &quot;The bitch by her acting too hastily brought forth the blind&quot;. Though many proverbs are ancient, they were all newly created at some point by somebody. Sometimes it is easy to detect that a proverb is newly coined by a reference to something recent, such as the Haitian proverb &quot;The fish that is being microwaved doesn&#x27;t fear the lightning&quot;. Similarly, there is a recent Maltese proverb, &quot;wil-muturi, ferh u duluri&quot; &quot;Women and motorcycles are joys and griefs&quot;; the proverb is clearly new, but still formed as a traditional style couplet with rhyme. Also, there is a proverb in the Kafa language of Ethiopia that refers to the forced military conscription of the 1980s, &quot;...the one who hid himself lived to have children.&quot; A Mongolian proverb also shows evidence of recent origin, &quot;A beggar who sits on gold; Foam rubber piled on edge.&quot; Another example of a proverb that is clearly recent is this from Sesotho: &quot;A mistake goes with the printer.&quot; A political candidate in Kenya popularised a new proverb in his 1995 campaign, &quot;Chuth ber&quot; &quot;Immediacy is best&quot;. &quot;The proverb has since been used in other contexts to prompt quick action.&quot; Over 1,400 new English proverbs are said to have been coined and gained currency in the 20th century.

This process of creating proverbs is always ongoing, so that possible new proverbs are being created constantly. Those sayings that are adopted and used by an adequate number of people become proverbs in that society.
The creation of proverbs in many parts of the world during the Corona-virus era showed how quickly proverbs and anti-proverbs can be created.

== Interpretations ==
Interpreting proverbs is often complex, but is best done in a context. Interpreting proverbs from other cultures is much more difficult than interpreting proverbs in one&#x27;s own culture. Even within English-speaking cultures, there is difference of opinion on how to interpret the proverb &quot;A rolling stone gathers no moss.&quot; Some see it as condemning a person that keeps moving, seeing moss as a positive thing, such as profit; others see the proverb as praising people that keep moving and developing, seeing moss as a negative thing, such as negative habits.

Similarly, among Tajik speakers, the proverb &quot;One hand cannot clap&quot; has two significantly different interpretations. Most see the proverb as promoting teamwork. Others understand it to mean that an argument requires two people. In an extreme example, one researcher working in Ghana found that for a single Akan proverb, twelve different interpretations were given. Proverb interpretation is not automatic, even for people within a culture: Owomoyela tells of a Yoruba radio program that asked people to interpret an unfamiliar Yoruba proverb, &quot;very few people could do so&quot;. Siran found that people who had moved out of the traditional Vute-speaking area of Cameroon were not able to interpret Vute proverbs correctly, even though they still spoke Vute. Their interpretations tended to be literal.

Children will sometimes interpret proverbs in a literal sense, not yet knowing how to understand the conventionalized metaphor. Interpretation of proverbs is also affected by injuries and diseases of the brain, &quot;A hallmark of schizophrenia is impaired proverb interpretation.&quot;

==Features==
===Grammatical structures===
Proverbs in various languages are found with a wide variety of grammatical structures. In English, for example, we find the following structures (in addition to others):
* Imperative, negative – Don&#x27;t beat a dead horse.
* Imperative, positive – !
* Parallel phrases – Garbage in, garbage out.
* Rhetorical question – Is the Pope Catholic?
* Declarative sentence – Birds of a feather flock together.

However, people will often quote only a fraction of a proverb to invoke an entire proverb, e.g. &quot;All is fair&quot; instead of &quot;All is fair in love and war&quot;, and &quot;A rolling stone&quot; for &quot;A rolling stone gathers no moss.&quot;

The grammar of proverbs is not always the typical grammar of the spoken language. Elements are often moved around, to achieve rhyme or focus.

Another type of grammatical construction is the wellerism, a speaker and a quotation, often with an unusual circumstance, such as the following, a representative of a wellerism proverb found in many languages: &quot;The bride couldn&#x27;t dance; she said, &#x27;The room floor isn&#x27;t flat.&#x27;&quot;

Another type of grammatical structure in proverbs is a short dialogue:
* Shor/Khkas (SW Siberia): &quot;They asked the camel, &#x27;Why is your neck crooked?&#x27; The camel laughed roaringly, &#x27;What of me is straight?&#x27;&quot;
* Armenian: &quot;They asked the wine, &#x27;Have you built or destroyed more?&#x27; It said, &#x27;I do not know of building; of destroying I know a lot.&#x27;&quot;
* Bakgatla (a.k.a. Tswana): &quot;The thukhui jackal said, &#x27;I can run fast.&#x27; But the sands said, &#x27;We are wide.&#x27;&quot; (Botswana)
* Bamana: &quot;&#x27;Speech, what made you good?&#x27; &#x27;The way I am,&#x27; said Speech. &#x27;What made you bad?&#x27; &#x27;The way I am,&#x27; said Speech.&quot; (Mali)

===Conservative language===

Because many proverbs are both poetic and traditional, they are often passed down in fixed forms. Though spoken language may change, many proverbs are often preserved in conservative, even archaic, form. &quot;Proverbs often contain archaic... words and structures.&quot; In English, for example, &quot;betwixt&quot; is not commonly used, but a form of it is still heard (or read) in the proverb &quot;There is many a slip &#x27;twixt the cup and the lip.&quot; The conservative form preserves the meter and the rhyme. This conservative nature of proverbs can result in archaic words and grammatical structures being preserved in individual proverbs, as has been widely documented, e.g. in Amharic, Nsenga, Polish, Venda, Hebrew, Giriama, Georgian, Karachay-Balkar, Hausa, Uzbek, Budu of Congo, Kazakh. 

In addition, proverbs may still be used in languages which were once more widely known in a society, but are now no longer so widely known. For example, English speakers use some non-English proverbs that are drawn from languages that used to be widely understood by the educated class, e.g. &quot;C&#x27;est la vie&quot; from French and &quot;Carpe diem&quot; from Latin.

Proverbs are often handed down through generations. Therefore, &quot;many proverbs refer to old measurements, obscure professions, outdated weapons, unknown plants, animals, names, and various other traditional matters.&quot;
Therefore, it is common that they preserve words that become less common and archaic in broader society. Archaic proverbs in solid formsuch as murals, carvings, and glasscan be viewed even after the language of their form is no longer widely understood, such as an Anglo-French proverb in a stained glass window in York.

===Borrowing and spread===
Proverbs are often and easily translated and transferred from one language into another. &quot;There is nothing so uncertain as the derivation of proverbs, the same proverb being often found in all nations, and it is impossible to assign its paternity.&quot;

Proverbs are often borrowed across lines of language, religion, and even time. For example, a proverb of the approximate form &quot;No flies enter a mouth that is shut&quot; is currently found in Spain, France, Ethiopia, and many countries in between. It is embraced as a true local proverb in many places and should not be excluded in any collection of proverbs because it is shared by the neighbors. However, though it has gone through multiple languages and millennia, the proverb can be traced back to an ancient Babylonian proverb Another example of a widely spread proverb is &quot;A drowning person clutches at [frogs] foam&quot;, found in Peshai of Afghanistan and Orma of Kenya, and presumably places in between.

Proverbs about one hand clapping are common across Asia, from Dari in Afghanistan to Japan. Some studies have been done devoted to the spread of proverbs in certain regions, such as India and her neighbors and Europe. An extreme example of the borrowing and spread of proverbs was the work done to create a corpus of proverbs for Esperanto, where all the proverbs were translated from other languages.

It is often not possible to trace the direction of borrowing a proverb between languages. This is complicated by the fact that the borrowing may have been through plural languages. In some cases, it is possible to make a strong case for discerning the direction of the borrowing based on an artistic form of the proverb in one language, but a prosaic form in another language. For example, in Ethiopia there is a proverb &quot;Of mothers and water, there is none evil.&quot; It is found in Amharic, Alaaba language, and Oromo, three languages of Ethiopia:
* Oromo: &quot;Hadhaa fi bishaan, hamaa hin qaban.&quot;
* Amharic: &quot;Käənnatənna wəha, kəfu yälläm.&quot;
* Alaaba: &quot;Wiihaa ʔamaataa hiilu yoosebaʔa&quot;
The Oromo version uses poetic features, such as the initial &quot;ha&quot; in both clauses with the final &quot;-aa&quot; in the same word, and both clauses ending with &quot;-an&quot;. Also, both clauses are built with the vowel &quot;a&quot; in the first and last words, but the vowel &quot;i&quot; in the one syllable central word. In contrast, the Amharic and Alaaba versions of the proverb show little evidence of sound-based art.

However, not all languages have proverbs. Proverbs are (nearly) universal across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Some languages in the Pacific have them, such as Māori with whakataukī. Other Pacific languages do not, e.g. &quot;there are no proverbs in Kilivila&quot; of the Trobriand Islands. In the New World, there are almost no proverbs: &quot;While proverbs abound in the thousands in most cultures of the world, it remains a riddle why the Native Americans have hardly any proverb tradition at all.&quot; Although, &quot;as Mieder has commented . . . the reason for the visible lack of proverbs was probably the inability of foreign
researchers to identify proverbial utterances among those peoples.&quot; Hakamies has examined the matter of whether proverbs are found universally, a universal genre, concluding that they are not.

==Use==
===In conversation===
Proverbs are used in conversation by adults more than children, partially because adults have learned more proverbs than children. Also, using proverbs well is a skill that is developed over years. Additionally, children have not mastered the patterns of metaphorical expression that are invoked in proverb use. Proverbs, because they are indirect, allow a speaker to disagree or give advice in a way that may be less offensive. Studying actual proverb use in conversation, however, is difficult since the researcher must wait for proverbs to happen. An Ethiopian researcher, Tadesse Jaleta Jirata, made headway in such research by attending and taking notes at events where he knew proverbs were expected to be part of the conversations.

===In literature===
Many authors have used proverbs in their writings, for a very wide variety of literary genres: epics, novels, poems, short stories.

Probably the most famous user of proverbs in novels is J. R. R. Tolkien in his &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; series. Herman Melville is noted for creating proverbs in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; and in his poetry. Also, C. S. Lewis created a dozen proverbs in &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, and Mercedes Lackey created dozens for her invented Shin&#x27;a&#x27;in and Tale&#x27;edras cultures; Lackey&#x27;s proverbs are notable in that they are reminiscent to those of Ancient Asia – e.g. &quot;Just because you feel certain an enemy is lurking behind every bush, it doesn&#x27;t follow that you are wrong&quot; is like to &quot;Before telling secrets on the road, look in the bushes.&quot; These authors are notable for not only using proverbs as integral to the development of the characters and the story line, but also for creating proverbs.

Among medieval literary texts, Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s Troilus and Criseyde plays a special role because Chaucer&#x27;s usage seems to challenge the truth value of proverbs by exposing their epistemological unreliability. Rabelais used proverbs to write an entire chapter of Gargantua.

The patterns of using proverbs in literature can change over time. A study of &quot;classical Chinese novels&quot; found proverb use as frequently as one proverb every 3,500 words in the &quot;Water Margin&quot; (&quot;Shuihu zhuan&quot;) and one proverb every 4,000 words in &quot;Wen Jou-hsiang&quot;. But modern Chinese novels have fewer proverbs by far.
Proverbs (or portions of them) have been the inspiration for titles of books: &quot;The Bigger they Come&quot; by Erle Stanley Gardner, and &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; (several books with this title), &quot;Devil in the Details&quot; (multiple books with this title). Sometimes a title alludes to a proverb, but does not actually quote much of it, such as &quot;The Gift Horse&#x27;s Mouth&quot; by Robert Campbell. Some books or stories have titles that are twisted proverbs, anti-proverbs, such as &quot;No use dying over spilled milk&quot;, &quot;When life gives you lululemons,&quot; and two books titled &quot;Blessed are the Cheesemakers&quot;. The twisted proverb of last title was also used in the Monty Python movie Life of Brian, where a person mishears one of Jesus Christ&#x27;s beatitudes, &quot;I think it was &#x27;Blessed are the cheesemakers.&#x27;&quot;

Some books and stories are built around a proverb. Some of Tolkien&#x27;s books have been analyzed as having &quot;governing proverbs&quot; where &quot;the action of a book turns on or fulfills a proverbial saying.&quot; Some stories have been written with a proverb overtly as an opening, such as &quot;A stitch in time saves nine&quot; at the beginning of &quot;Kitty&#x27;s Class Day&quot;, one of Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s &quot;Proverb Stories&quot;. Other times, a proverb appears at the end of a story, summing up a moral to the story, frequently found in Aesop&#x27;s Fables, such as &quot;Heaven helps those who help themselves&quot; from &quot;Hercules and the Wagoner&quot;. In a novel by the Ivorian novelist Ahmadou Kourouma, &quot;proverbs are used to conclude each chapter&quot;.

Proverbs have also been used strategically by poets. Sometimes proverbs (or portions of them or anti-proverbs) are used for titles, such as &quot;A bird in the bush&quot; by Lord Kennet and his stepson Peter Scott and &quot;The blind leading the blind&quot; by Lisa Mueller. Sometimes, multiple proverbs are important parts of poems, such as Paul Muldoon&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;, which begins &quot;You can lead a horse to water but you can&#x27;t make it hold its nose to the grindstone and hunt with the hounds. Every dog has a stitch in time...&quot; In Finnish there are proverb poems written hundreds of years ago. The Turkish poet Refiki wrote an entire poem by stringing proverbs together, which has been translated into English poetically yielding such verses as &quot;Be watchful and be wary, / But seldom grant a boon; / The man who calls the piper / Will also call the tune.&quot; Eliza Griswold also created a poem by stringing proverbs together, Libyan proverbs translated into English.

Because proverbs are familiar and often pointed, they have been used by a number of hip-hop poets. This has been true not only in the USA, birthplace of hip-hop, but also in Nigeria. Since Nigeria is so multilingual, hip-hop poets there use proverbs from various languages, mixing them in as it fits their need, sometimes translating the original. For example,
&quot;They forget say ogbon ju agbaraloThey forget that wisdom is greater than power&quot;

Some authors have bent and twisted proverbs, creating anti-proverbs, for a variety of literary effects. For example, in the Harry Potter novels, J. K. Rowling reshapes a standard English proverb into &quot;It&#x27;s no good crying over spilt potion&quot; and Dumbledore advises Harry not to &quot;count your owls before they are delivered&quot;. In a slightly different use of reshaping proverbs, in the Aubrey–Maturin series of historical naval novels by Patrick O&#x27;Brian, Capt. Jack Aubrey humorously mangles and mis-splices proverbs, such as &quot;Never count the bear&#x27;s skin before it is hatched&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s a good deal to be said for making hay while the iron is hot.&quot; Earlier than O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s Aubrey, Beatrice Grimshaw also used repeated splicings of proverbs in the mouth of an eccentric marquis to create a memorable character in &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot;, such as &quot;The proof of the pudding sweeps clean&quot; (p. 109) and &quot;A stitch in time is as good as a mile&quot; (p. 97).
Because proverbs are so much a part of the language and culture, authors have sometimes used proverbs in historical fiction effectively, but anachronistically, before the proverb was actually known. For example, the novel &quot;Ramage and the Rebels&quot;, by Dudley Pope is set in approximately 1800. Captain Ramage reminds his adversary &quot;You are supposed to know that it is dangerous to change horses in midstream&quot; (p. 259), with another allusion to the same proverb three pages later. However, the proverb about changing horses in midstream is reliably dated to 1864, so the proverb could not have been known or used by a character from that period.

Some authors have used so many proverbs that there have been entire books written cataloging their proverb usage, such as Charles Dickens, Agatha Christie, George Bernard Shaw, Miguel de Cervantes, and Friedrich Nietzsche.

On the non-fiction side, proverbs have also been used by authors for articles that have no connection to the study of proverbs. Some have been used as the basis for book titles, e.g. &quot;I Shop, Therefore I Am: Compulsive Buying and the Search for Self&quot; by April Lane Benson. Some proverbs been used as the basis for article titles, though often in altered form: &quot;All our eggs in a broken basket: How the Human Terrain System is undermining sustainable military cultural competence&quot; and &quot;Should Rolling Stones Worry About Gathering Moss?&quot;, &quot;Between a Rock and a Soft Place&quot;, and the pair &quot;Verbs of a feather flock together&quot; and &quot;Verbs of a feather flock together II&quot;. Proverbs have been noted as common in subtitles of articles such as &quot;Discontinued intergenerational transmission of Czech in Texas: &#x27;Hindsight is better than foresight&#x27;.&quot; Also, the reverse is found with a proverb (complete or partial) as the title, then an explanatory subtitle, &quot;To Change or Not to Change Horses: The World War II Elections&quot;. Many authors have cited proverbs as epigrams at the beginning of their articles, e.g. &quot;&#x27;If you want to dismantle a hedge, remove one thorn at a time&#x27; Somali proverb&quot; in an article on peacemaking in Somalia. An article about research among the Māori used a Māori proverb as a title, then began the article with the Māori form of the proverb as an epigram &quot;Set the overgrown bush alight and the new flax shoots will spring up&quot;, followed by three paragraphs about how the proverb served as a metaphor for the research and the present context. A British proverb has even been used as the title for a doctoral dissertation: &quot;Where there is muck there is brass&quot;. Proverbs have also been used as a framework for an article.

===In drama and film===

Similarly to other forms of literature, proverbs have also been used as important units of language in drama and films. This is true from the days of classical Greek works to old French to Shakespeare, to 19th Century Spanish, 19th century Russian, to today. The use of proverbs in drama and film today is still found in languages around the world, with plenty of examples from Africa, including Yorùbá and Igbo of Nigeria.

A film that makes rich use of proverbs is &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, known for both using and creating proverbs. Other studies of the use of proverbs in film include work by Kevin McKenna on the Russian film &quot;Aleksandr Nevsky&quot;, Haase&#x27;s study of an adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood, Elias Dominguez Barajas on the film &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot;, and Aboneh Ashagrie on &quot;The Athlete&quot; (a movie in Amharic about Abebe Bikila).

Television programs have also been named with reference to proverbs, usually shortened, such Birds of a Feather and Diff&#x27;rent Strokes.

In the case of &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, the screenplay by Eric Roth had more proverbs than the novel by Winston Groom, but for &quot;The Harder They Come&quot;, the reverse is true, where the novel derived from the movie by Michael Thelwell has many more proverbs than the movie.

Éric Rohmer, the French film director, directed a series of films, the &quot;Comedies and Proverbs&quot;, where each film was based on a proverb: &quot;The Aviator&#x27;s Wife&quot;, &quot;The Perfect Marriage&quot;, &quot;Pauline at the Beach&quot;, &quot;Full Moon in Paris&quot; (the film&#x27;s proverb was invented by Rohmer himself: &quot;The one who has two wives loses his soul, the one who has two houses loses his mind.&quot;), &quot;The Green Ray&quot;, &quot;Boyfriends and Girlfriends&quot;.

Movie titles based on proverbs include &quot;Murder Will Out (1939 film)&quot;, &quot;Try, Try Again&quot;, and &quot;The Harder They Fall&quot;. A twisted anti-proverb was the title for a Three Stooges film, &quot;A Bird in the Head&quot;. The title of an award-winning Turkish film, Three Monkeys, also invokes a proverb, though the title does not fully quote it.

They have also been used as the titles of plays: &quot;Baby with the Bathwater&quot; by Christopher Durang, &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; by Mary Gallagher, and &quot;The Dog in the Manger&quot; by Charles Hale Hoyt. The use of proverbs as titles for plays is not, of course, limited to English plays: &quot;Il faut qu&#x27;une porte soit ouverte ou fermée&quot; (A door must be open or closed) by Paul de Musset. Proverbs have also been used in musical dramas, such as &quot;The Full Monty&quot;, which has been shown to use proverbs in clever ways. In the lyrics for &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, Gaston plays with three proverbs in sequence, &quot;All roads lead to.../The best things in life are.../All&#x27;s well that ends with...me.&quot;

===In music===

Proverbs are often poetic in and of themselves, making them ideally suited for adapting into songs. Proverbs have been used in music from opera to country to hip-hop. Proverbs have also been used in music in many languages, such as the Akan language the Igede language, Spanish, and Igbo.
In English the proverb (or rather the beginning of the proverb), If the shoe fits has been used as a title for three albums and five songs. Other English examples of using proverbs in music include Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Easy come, easy go&quot;, Harold Robe&#x27;s &quot;Never swap horses when you&#x27;re crossing a stream&quot;, Arthur Gillespie&#x27;s &quot;Absence makes the heart grow fonder&quot;, Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Like a rolling stone&quot;, Cher&#x27;s &quot;Apples don&#x27;t fall far from the tree&quot;. Lynn Anderson made famous a song full of proverbs, &quot;I never promised you a rose garden&quot; (written by Joe South). In choral music, we find Michael Torke&#x27;s &quot;Proverbs&quot; for female voice and ensemble. A number of Blues musicians have also used proverbs extensively. The frequent use of proverbs in Country music has led to published studies of proverbs in this genre. The Reggae artist Jahdan Blakkamoore has recorded a piece titled &quot;Proverbs Remix&quot;. The opera &quot;Maldobrìe&quot; contains careful use of proverbs. An extreme example of many proverbs used in composing songs is a song consisting almost entirely of proverbs performed by Bruce Springsteen, &quot;My best was never good enough&quot;. The Mighty Diamonds recorded a song called simply &quot;Proverbs&quot;.

The band Fleet Foxes used the proverb painting Netherlandish Proverbs for the cover of their album Fleet Foxes.

In addition to proverbs being used in songs themselves, some rock bands have used parts of proverbs as their names, such as the Rolling Stones, Bad Company, The Mothers of Invention, Feast or Famine, and Of Mice and Men. There have been at least two groups that called themselves &quot;The Proverbs&quot;, and there is a hip-hop performer in South Africa known as &quot;Proverb&quot;. In addition, many albums have been named with allusions to proverbs, such as &quot;Spilt milk&quot; (a title used by Jellyfish and also Kristina Train), &quot;The more things change&quot; by Machine Head, &quot;Silk purse&quot; by Linda Ronstadt, &quot;Another day, another dollar&quot; by DJ Scream Roccett, &quot;The blind leading the naked&quot; by Violent Femmes, &quot;What&#x27;s good for the goose is good for the gander&quot; by Bobby Rush, &quot;Resistance is Futile&quot; by Steve Coleman, &quot;Murder will out&quot; by Fan the Fury. The proverb &quot;Feast or famine&quot; has been used as an album title by Chuck Ragan, Reef the Lost Cauze, Indiginus, and DaVinci. Whitehorse mixed two proverbs for the name of their album &quot;Leave no bridge unburned&quot;. The band Splinter Group released an album titled &quot;When in Rome, Eat Lions,&quot; referring to the proverb &quot;When in Rome, do as the Romans do&quot;. The band Downcount used a proverb for the name of their tour, &quot;Come and take it&quot;.

===In visual form===


From ancient times, people around the world have recorded proverbs in visual form. This has been done in two ways. First, proverbs have been &quot;written&quot; to be displayed, often in a decorative manner, such as on pottery, cross-stitch, murals, kangas (East African women&#x27;s wraps), quilts, a stained glass window, and graffiti.

Secondly, proverbs have often been visually depicted in a variety of media, including paintings, etchings, and sculpture. Jakob Jordaens painted a plaque with a proverb about drunkenness above a drunk man wearing a crown, titled &quot;The King Drinks&quot;. Probably the most famous examples of depicting proverbs are the different versions of the paintings &quot;Netherlandish Proverbs&quot; by the father and son Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Pieter Brueghel the Younger, the proverbial meanings of these paintings being the subject of a 2004 conference, which led to a published volume of studies (Mieder 2004a). The same father and son also painted versions of The Blind Leading the Blind, a Biblical proverb. These and similar paintings inspired another famous painting depicting some proverbs and also idioms (leading to a series of additional paintings), such as &quot;Proverbidioms&quot; by T. E. Breitenbach. Another painting inspired by Bruegel&#x27;s work is by the Chinese artist, Ah To, who created a painting illustrating 81 Cantonese sayings. Corey Barksdale has produced a book of paintings with specific proverbs and pithy quotations. The British artist Chris Gollon has painted a major work entitled &quot;Big Fish Eat Little Fish&quot;, a title echoing Bruegel&#x27;s painting of the same name.

Sometimes well-known proverbs are pictured on objects, without a text actually quoting the proverb, such as the three wise monkeys who remind us &quot;Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil&quot;. When the proverb is well known, viewers are able to recognize the proverb and understand the image appropriately, but if viewers do not recognize the proverb, much of the effect of the image is lost. For example, there is a Japanese painting in the Bonsai museum in Saitama city that depicted flowers on a dead tree, but only when the curator learned the ancient (and no longer current) proverb &quot;Flowers on a dead tree&quot; did the curator understand the deeper meaning of the painting. Also in Japan, an image of Mount Fuji, a hawk/falcon, and three egg plants, leads viewers to remember the proverb, &quot;One Mt. Fuji, two falcons, three egg plants&quot;, a Hatsuyume dream predicting a long life.

A study of school students found that students remembered proverbs better when there were visual representations of proverbs along with the verbal form of the proverbs.

A bibliography on proverbs in visual form has been prepared by Mieder and Sobieski (1999). Interpreting visual images of proverbs is subjective, but familiarity with the depicted proverb helps.

Some artists have used proverbs and anti-proverbs for titles of their paintings, alluding to a proverb rather than picturing it. For example, Vivienne LeWitt painted a piece titled &quot;If the shoe doesn&#x27;t fit, must we change the foot?&quot;, which shows neither foot nor shoe, but a woman counting her money as she contemplates different options when buying vegetables.

In 2018, 13 sculptures depicting Maltese proverbs were installed in open spaces of downtown Valletta.

===In cartoons===
Cartoonists, both editorial and pure humorists, have often used proverbs, sometimes primarily building on the text, sometimes primarily on the situation visually, the best cartoons combining both. Not surprisingly, cartoonists often twist proverbs, such as visually depicting a proverb literally or twisting the text as an anti-proverb. An example with all of these traits is a cartoon showing a waitress delivering two plates with worms on them, telling the customers, &quot;Two early bird specials... here ya go.&quot;

The traditional Three wise monkeys were depicted in Bizarro with different labels. Instead of the negative imperatives, the one with ears covered bore the sign &quot;See and speak evil&quot;, the one with eyes covered bore the sign &quot;See and hear evil&quot;, etc. The caption at the bottom read &quot;The power of positive thinking.&quot; Another cartoon showed a customer in a pharmacy telling a pharmacist, &quot;I&#x27;ll have an ounce of prevention.&quot; The comic strip The Argyle Sweater showed an Egyptian archeologist loading a mummy on the roof of a vehicle, refusing the offer of a rope to tie it on, with the caption &quot;A fool and his mummy are soon parted.&quot; The comic One Big Happy showed a conversation where one person repeatedly posed a part of various proverb and the other tried to complete each one, resulting in such humorous results as &quot;Don&#x27;t change horses... unless you can lift those heavy diapers.&quot;

Editorial cartoons can use proverbs to make their points with extra force as they can invoke the wisdom of society, not just the opinion of the editors. In an example that invoked a proverb only visually, when a US government agency (GSA) was caught spending money extravagantly, a cartoon showed a black pot labeled &quot;Congress&quot; telling a black kettle labeled &quot;GSA&quot;, &quot;Stop wasting the taxpayers&#x27; money!&quot; It may have taken some readers a moment of pondering to understand it, but the impact of the message was the stronger for it.

Cartoons with proverbs are so common that Wolfgang Mieder has published a collected volume of them, many of them editorial cartoons. For example, a German editorial cartoon linked a current politician to the Nazis, showing him with a bottle of swastika-labeled wine and the caption &quot;In vino veritas&quot;.

One cartoonist very self-consciously drew and wrote cartoons based on proverbs for the University of Vermont student newspaper &quot;The Water Tower&quot;, under the title &quot;Proverb place&quot;.
===In advertising===

Proverbs are frequently used in advertising, often in slightly modified form.
Ford once advertised its Thunderbird with, &quot;One drive is worth a thousand words&quot; (Mieder 2004b: 84). This is doubly interesting since the underlying proverb behind this, &quot;One picture is worth a thousand words,&quot; was originally introduced into the English proverb repertoire in an ad for televisions (Mieder 2004b: 83).

A few of the many proverbs adapted and used in advertising include:
* &quot;Live by the sauce, dine by the sauce&quot; (Buffalo Wild Wings)
* &quot;At D &amp; D Dogs, you can teach an old dog new tricks&quot; (D &amp; D Dogs)
* &quot;If at first you don&#x27;t succeed, you&#x27;re using the wrong equipment&quot; (John Deere)
* &quot;A pfennig saved is a pfennig earned.&quot; (Volkswagen)
* &quot;Not only absence makes the heart grow fonder.&quot; (Godiva Chocolatier)
* &quot;Where Hogs fly&quot; (Grand Prairie AirHogs) baseball team
* &quot;Waste not. Read a lot.&quot; (Half Price Books)

The GEICO company has created a series of television ads that are built around proverbs, such as &quot;A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush&quot;, and &quot;The pen is mightier than the sword&quot;, &quot;Pigs may fly/When pigs fly&quot;, &quot;If a tree falls in the forest...&quot;, and &quot;Words can never hurt you&quot;. Doritos made a commercial based on the proverb, &quot;When pigs fly.&quot; Many advertisements that use proverbs shorten or amend them, such as, &quot;Think outside the shoebox.&quot;
Use of proverbs in advertising is not limited to the English language. Seda Başer Çoban has studied the use of proverbs in Turkish advertising. Tatira has given a number of examples of proverbs used in advertising in Zimbabwe. However, unlike the examples given above in English, all of which are anti-proverbs, Tatira&#x27;s examples are standard proverbs. Where the English proverbs above are meant to make a potential customer smile, in one of the Zimbabwean examples &quot;both the content of the proverb and the fact that it is phrased as a proverb secure the idea of a secure time-honored relationship between the company and the individuals&quot;. When newer buses were imported, owners of older buses compensated by painting a traditional proverb on the sides of their buses, &quot;Going fast does not assure safe arrival&quot;.

==Variations==
===Counter proverbs===
There are often proverbs that contradict each other, such as &quot;Look before you leap&quot; and &quot;He who hesitates is lost&quot;, or &quot;Many hands make light work&quot; and &quot;Too many cooks spoil the broth&quot;. These have been labeled &quot;counter proverbs&quot; or &quot;antonymous proverbs&quot;. Stanisław Lec observed, &quot;Proverbs contradict each other. And that, to be sure, is folk wisdom.&quot;
When there are such counter proverbs, each can be used in its own appropriate situation, and neither is intended to be a universal truth. 

The concept of &quot;counter proverb&quot; is more about pairs of contradictory proverbs than about the use of proverbs to counter each other in an argument. For example, from the Tafi language of Ghana, the following pair of proverbs are counter to each other but are each used in appropriate contexts, &quot;A co-wife who is too powerful for you, you address her as your mother&quot; and &quot;Do not call your mother&#x27;s co-wife your mother...&quot; In Nepali, there is a set of totally contradictory proverbs: &quot;Religion is victorious and sin erodes&quot; and &quot;Religion erodes and sin is victorious&quot;.
Also, the following pair are counter proverbs from the Kasena of Ghana: &quot;It is the patient person who will milk a barren cow&quot; and &quot;The person who would milk a barren cow must prepare for a kick on the forehead&quot;. From Lugbara language (of Uganda and Congo), there are a pair of counter proverbs: &quot;The elephant&#x27;s tusk does not ovewhelm the elephant&quot; and &quot;The elephant&#x27;s tusks weigh the elephant down&quot;. The two contradict each other, whether they are used in an argument or not (though indeed they were used in an argument). But the same work contains an appendix with many examples of proverbs used in arguing for contrary positions, but proverbs that are not inherently contradictory, such as &quot;One is better off with hope of a cow&#x27;s return than news of its death&quot; countered by &quot;If you don&#x27;t know a goat [before its death] you mock at its skin&quot;. Though this pair was used in a contradictory way in a conversation, they are not a set of &quot;counter proverbs&quot;.

Discussing counter proverbs in the Badaga language, Hockings explained that in his large collection &quot;a few proverbs are mutually contradictory... we can be sure that the Badagas do not see the matter that way, and would explain such apparent contradictions by reasoning that proverb &quot;x&quot; is used in one context, while &quot;y&quot; is used in quite another.&quot; Comparing Korean proverbs, &quot;when you compare two proverbs, often they will be contradictory.&quot; They are used for &quot;a particular situation&quot;.

&quot;Counter proverbs&quot; are not the same as a &quot;paradoxical proverb&quot;, a proverb that contains a seeming paradox.

===Metaproverbs===
In many cultures, proverbs are so important and so prominent that there are proverbs about proverbs, that is, &quot;metaproverbs&quot;. The most famous one is from Yoruba of Nigeria, &quot;Proverbs are the horses of speech, if communication is lost we use proverbs to find it&quot;, used by Wole Soyinka in &quot;Death and the King&#x27;s Horsemen&quot;. In Mieder&#x27;s bibliography of proverb studies, there are twelve publications listed as describing metaproverbs. Other metaproverbs include:
* &quot;As a boy should resemble his father, so should the proverb fit the conversation.&quot; (Afar, Ethiopia)
* &quot;Proverbs are the cream of language&quot; (Afar, Ethiopia)
* &quot;One proverb gives rise to a point of discussion and another ends it.&quot; (Guji Oromo &amp; Arsi Oromo, Ethiopia)
* &quot;Is proverb a child of chieftancy?&quot; (Igala, Nigeria)
* &quot;Whoever has seen enough of life will be able to tell a lot of proverbs.&quot; (Igala, Nigeria)
* &quot;Bereft of proverbs, speech flounders and falls short of its mark, whereas aided by them, communication is fleet and unerring&quot; (Yoruba, Nigeria)
* &quot;A conversation without proverbs is like stew without salt.&quot; (Oromo, Ethiopia)
* &quot;If you never offer your uncle palmwine, you&#x27;ll not learn many proverbs.&quot; (Yoruba, Nigeria)
* &quot;If a proverb has no bearing on a proverb, one does not use it.&quot; (Yoruba, Nigeria)
* &quot;Proverbs finish the problem.&quot; (Alaaba, Ethiopia)
* &quot;When a proverb about a ragged basket is mentioned, the person who is skinny knows that he/she is the person alluded to.&quot; (Igbo, Nigeria)
* &quot;A proverb is the quintessentially active bit of language.&quot; (Turkish)
* &quot;The purest water is spring water, the most concise speech is proverb.&quot; (Zhuang, China)
* &quot;A proverb does not lie.&quot; (Arabic of Cairo)
* &quot;A saying is a flower, a proverb is a berry.&quot; (Russian)
* &quot;Honey is sweet to the mouth; proverb is music to the ear.&quot; (Tibetan)
* &quot;Old proverb are little Gospels&quot; (Galician)
* &quot;Proverb[-using] man, queer and vulgar/bothering man&quot; (Spanish)
* &quot;A hasty man talks without using a proverb.&quot; (Kambaata, Ethiopia)
* &quot;He who has a father knows the proverb of grandfather.&quot; (Kirundi, Burundi)
* &quot;The wisdom of the proverb cannot be surpassed.&quot; (Turkish, Turkey)
* “Where there is rhythm and alliteration, there lies a proverb.” (Gujerati, India)
* &quot;Proverbs are in the heart, light rain is in the clouds.&quot; (Mongolian)
* &quot;For a person who knows crying, don&#x27;t tell him proverbs.&quot;(Nzima language, Ghana)
* &quot;When my proverbs finish, that is when my talking will finish.&quot; (Igbo, Nigeria)
* &quot;To the idiot we say things clearly, To the wise we speak in proverbs.&quot;(Yombe, Gabon)

==Applications==


There is a growing interest in deliberately using proverbs to achieve goals, usually to support and promote changes in society. Proverbs have also been used for public health promotion, such as promoting breast feeding with a shawl bearing a Swahili proverb &quot;Mother&#x27;s milk is sweet&quot;. Proverbs have also been applied for helping people manage diabetes, to combat prostitution, and for community development, to resolve conflicts, and to slow the transmission of HIV.

The most active field deliberately using proverbs is Christian ministry, where Joseph G. Healey and others have deliberately worked to catalyze the collection of proverbs from smaller languages and the application of them in a wide variety of church-related ministries, resulting in publications of collections and applications. This attention to proverbs by those in Christian ministries is not new, many pioneering proverb collections having been collected and published by Christian workers.

U.S. Navy Captain Edward Zellem pioneered the use of Afghan proverbs as a positive relationship-building tool during the war in Afghanistan, and in 2012 he published two bilingual collections of Afghan proverbs in Dari and English, part of an effort of nationbuilding, followed by a volume of Pashto proverbs in 2014.

===Cultural values===
There is a longstanding debate among proverb scholars as to whether the cultural values of specific language communities are reflected (to varying degree) in their proverbs. Many claim that the proverbs of a particular culture reflect the values of that specific culture, at least to some degree. Many writers have asserted that the proverbs of their cultures reflect their culture and values; this can be seen in such titles as the following: &quot;An introduction to Kasena society and culture through their proverbs&quot;, Prejudice, power, and poverty in Haiti: a study of a nation&#x27;s culture as seen through its proverbs, Proverbiality and worldview in Maltese and Arabic proverbs, Fatalistic traits in Finnish proverbs, &quot;Vietnamese cultural patterns and values as expressed in proverbs&quot;, &quot;The Wisdom and Philosophy of the Gikuyu proverbs: The Kihooto worldview&quot;, &quot;Spanish Grammar and Culture through Proverbs,&quot; and &quot;How Russian Proverbs Present the Russian National Character&quot;. Kohistani has written a thesis to show how understanding Afghan Dari proverbs will help Europeans understand Afghan culture.

However, a number of scholars argue that such claims are not valid. They have used a variety of arguments. Grauberg argues that since many proverbs are so widely circulated they are reflections of broad human experience, not any one culture&#x27;s unique viewpoint. Related to this line of argument, from a collection of 199 American proverbs, Jente showed that only 10 were coined in the USA, so that most of these proverbs would not reflect uniquely American values. Giving another line of reasoning that proverbs should not be trusted as a simplistic guide to cultural values, Mieder once observed &quot;proverbs come and go, that is, antiquated proverbs with messages and images we no longer relate to are dropped from our proverb repertoire, while new proverbs are created to reflect the mores and values of our time&quot;, so old proverbs still in circulation might reflect past values of a culture more than its current values. Also, within any language&#x27;s proverb repertoire, there may be &quot;counter proverbs&quot;, proverbs that contradict each other on the surface (see section above). When examining such counter proverbs, it is difficult to discern an underlying cultural value. With so many barriers to a simple calculation of values directly from proverbs, some feel &quot;one cannot draw conclusions about values of speakers simply from the texts of proverbs&quot;.

Many outsiders have studied proverbs to discern and understand cultural values and world view of cultural communities. These outsider scholars are confident that they have gained insights into the local cultures by studying proverbs, but this is not universally accepted.
Seeking empirical evidence to evaluate the question of whether proverbs reflect a culture&#x27;s values, some have counted the proverbs that support various values. For example, Moon lists what he sees as the top ten core cultural values of the Builsa society of Ghana, as exemplified by proverbs. He found that 18% of the proverbs he analyzed supported the value of being a member of the community, rather than being independent. This was corroboration to other evidence that collective community membership is an important value among the Builsa. In studying Tajik proverbs, Bell notes that the proverbs in his corpus &quot;Consistently illustrate Tajik values&quot; and &quot;The most often observed proverbs reflect the focal and specific values&quot; discerned in the thesis.

A study of English proverbs created since 1900 showed in the 1960s a sudden and significant increase in proverbs that reflected more casual attitudes toward sex. Since the 1960s was also the decade of the Sexual revolution, this shows a strong statistical link between the changed values of the decades and a change in the proverbs coined and used. Another study mining the same volume counted Anglo-American proverbs about religion to show that proverbs indicate attitudes toward religion are going downhill.

There are many examples where cultural values have been explained and illustrated by proverbs. For example, from India, the concept that birth determines one&#x27;s nature &quot;is illustrated in the oft-repeated proverb: there can be no friendship between grass-eaters and meat-eaters, between a food and its eater&quot;. Proverbs have been used to explain and illustrate the Fulani cultural value of &quot;pulaaku&quot;. But using proverbs to &quot;illustrate&quot; a cultural value is not the same as using a collection of proverbs to &quot;discern&quot; cultural values. In a comparative study between Spanish and Jordanian proverbs it is defined the social imagination for the mother as an archetype in the context of role transformation and in contrast with the roles of husband, son and brother, in two societies which might be occasionally associated with sexist and /or rural ideologies.

Some scholars have adopted a cautious approach, acknowledging at least a genuine, though limited, link between cultural values and proverbs: &quot;The cultural portrait painted by proverbs may be fragmented, contradictory, or otherwise at variance with reality... but must be regarded not as accurate renderings but rather as tantalizing shadows of the culture which spawned them.&quot; There is not yet agreement on the issue of whether, and how much, cultural values are reflected in a culture&#x27;s proverbs.

It is clear that the Soviet Union believed that proverbs had a direct link to the values of a culture, as they used them to try to create changes in the values of cultures within their sphere of domination. Sometimes they took old Russian proverbs and altered them into socialist forms. These new proverbs promoted Socialism and its attendant values, such as atheism and collectivism, e.g. &quot;Bread is given to us not by Christ, but by machines and collective farms&quot; and &quot;A good harvest is had only by a collective farm.&quot; They did not limit their efforts to Russian, but also produced &quot;newly coined proverbs that conformed to socialist thought&quot; in Tajik and other languages of the USSR.
===Religion===
Many proverbs from around the world address matters of ethics and expected of behavior. Therefore, it is not surprising that proverbs are often important texts in religions. The most obvious example is the Book of Proverbs in the Bible. Additional proverbs have also been coined to support religious values, such as the following from Dari of Afghanistan: &quot;In childhood you&#x27;re playful, In youth you&#x27;re lustful, In old age you&#x27;re feeble, So when will you before God be worshipful?&quot;

Clearly proverbs in religion are not limited to monotheists; among the Badagas of India (Sahivite Hindus), there is a traditional proverb &quot;Catch hold of and join with the man who has placed sacred ash [on himself].&quot; Proverbs are widely associated with large religions that draw from sacred books, but they are also used for religious purposes among groups with their own traditional religions, such as the Guji Oromo. The broadest comparative study of proverbs across religions is &quot;The eleven religions and their proverbial lore, a comparative study. A reference book to the eleven surviving major religions of the world&quot; by Selwyn Gurney Champion, from 1945. Some sayings from sacred books also become proverbs, even if they were not obviously proverbs in the original passage of the sacred book. For example, many quote &quot;Be sure your sin will find you out&quot; as a proverb from the Bible, but there is no evidence it was proverbial in its original usage (Numbers 32:23).

Not all religious references in proverbs are positive. Some are cynical, such as the Tajik and Uzbek proverb, &quot;Do as the mullah says, not as he does.&quot; An Indian proverb is cynical about devotees of Hinduism: &quot;[Only] When in distress, a man calls on Rama&quot;. In the context of Tibetan Buddhism, some Ladakhi proverbs mock the lamas, e.g. &quot;If the lama&#x27;s own head does not come out cleanly, how will he do the drawing upwards of the dead?... used for deriding the immoral life of the lamas.&quot; There is an Italian proverb that mocks churches, &quot;One barrel of wine can work more miracles than a church full of saints&quot;. There are so many Spanish proverbs mocking Catholic clergy that there is even a book of them, &quot;Refranero Anticlerical&quot;. Armenians have a proverb that mocks priests, &quot;Outside a priest, inside a beast.&quot;

Proverbs do not have to explicitly mention religion or religious figures to be used to mock a religion, seen in the fact that in a collection of 555 proverbs from the Lur, a Muslim group in Iran, the explanations for 15 of them use illustrations that mock Muslim clerics.

Dammann wrote, &quot;In the [African] traditional religions, specific religious ideas recede into the background... The influence of Islam manifests itself in African proverbs... Christian influences, on the contrary, are rare.&quot; If widely true in Africa, this is likely due to the longer presence of Islam in many parts of Africa. Reflection of Christian values is common in Amharic proverbs of Ethiopia, an area that has had a presence of Christianity for well over 1,000 years. The Islamic proverbial reproduction may also be shown in the image of some animals such as the dog. Although dog is portrayed in many European proverbs as the most faithful friend of man, it is represented in some Islamic countries as impure, dirty, vile, cowardly, ungrateful and treacherous, in addition to links to negative human superstitions such as loneliness, indifference and bad luck.

===Psychology===
Though much proverb scholarship is done by literary scholars, those studying the human mind have used proverbs in a variety of studies. One of the earliest studies in this field is the &quot;Proverbs Test&quot; by Gorham, developed in 1956. A similar test is being prepared in German. Proverbs have been used to evaluate dementia, study the cognitive development of children, measure the results of brain injuries, and study how the mind processes figurative language.

==Paremiology==


The study of proverbs is called paremiology which has a variety of uses in the study of such topics as philosophy, linguistics, and folklore. There are several types and styles of proverbs which are analyzed within Paremiology as is the use and misuse of familiar expressions which are not strictly &#x27;proverbial&#x27; in the dictionary definition of being fixed sentences

===Paremiological minimum===
Grigorii Permjakov developed the concept of the core set of proverbs that full members of society know, what he called the &quot;paremiological minimum&quot; (1979). For example, an adult American is expected to be familiar with &quot;Birds of a feather flock together&quot;, part of the American paremiological minimum. However, an average adult American is not expected to know &quot;Fair in the cradle, foul in the saddle&quot;, an old English proverb that is not part of the current American paremiological minimum. Thinking more widely than merely proverbs, Permjakov observed &quot;every adult Russian language speaker (over 20 years of age) knows no fewer than 800 proverbs, proverbial expressions, popular literary quotations and other forms of cliches&quot;. Studies of the paremiological minimum have been done for a limited number of languages, including Ukrainian, Russian, Hungarian, Czech, Somali, Nepali, Gujarati, Spanish, Esperanto, Polish, Spanish, and Croatian. Two noted examples of attempts to establish a paremiological minimum in America are by Haas (2008) and Hirsch, Kett, and Trefil (1988), the latter more prescriptive than descriptive. There is not yet a recognized standard method for calculating the paremiological minimum, as seen by comparing the various efforts to establish the paremiological minimum in a number of languages. &quot;No really convincing criteria have been offered for the size of a paremiological minimum.&quot;

===Sources for proverb study===
A seminal work in the study of proverbs is Archer Taylor&#x27;s &quot;The Proverb&quot; (1931), later republished by Wolfgang Mieder with Taylor&#x27;s Index included (1985/1934). A good introduction to the study of proverbs is Mieder&#x27;s 2004 volume, &quot;Proverbs: A Handbook&quot;. Mieder has also published a series of bibliography volumes on proverb research, as well as a large number of articles and other books in the field. Stan Nussbaum has edited a large collection on proverbs of Africa, published on a CD, including reprints of out-of-print collections, original collections, and works on analysis, bibliography, and application of proverbs to Christian ministry (1998). Paczolay has compared proverbs across Europe and published a collection of similar proverbs in 55 languages (1997). There is an academic journal of proverb study, &quot;Proverbium&quot; (), many back issues of which are available online. A volume containing articles on a wide variety of topics touching on proverbs was edited by Mieder and Alan Dundes (1994/1981). &quot;Paremia&quot; is a Spanish-language journal on proverbs, with articles available online. There are also papers on proverbs published in conference proceedings volumes from the annual Interdisciplinary Colloquium on Proverbs in Tavira, Portugal. Mieder has published a two-volume &quot;International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology&quot;, with a topical, language, and author index. Mieder has also published a bibliography of collections of proverbs from around the world. A broad introduction to proverb study, &quot;Introduction to Paremiology&quot;, edited by Hrisztalina Hrisztova-Gotthardt and Melita Aleksa Varga has been published in both hardcover and free open access, with articles by a dozen different authors. In 2023, Wolfgang Mieder produced a new bibliography volume with 6,364 entries, available for free download from the Web: &quot;International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology (2008-2022)&quot;.

===Noteworthy proverb scholars (paremiologists and paremiographers)===

The study of proverbs has been built by a number of notable scholars and contributors. Earlier scholars were more concerned with collecting than analyzing. Desiderius Erasmus was a Latin scholar (1466–1536), whose collection of Latin proverbs, known as &quot;Adagia&quot;, spread Latin proverbs across Europe. Juan de Mal Lara was a 16th century Spanish scholar, one of his books being 1568 &quot;Philosophia vulgar&quot;, the first part of which contains one thousand and one sayings. Hernán Núñez published a collection of Spanish proverbs (1555).

In the 19th century, a growing number of scholars published collections of proverbs, such as Samuel Adalberg who published collections of Yiddish proverbs (1888 &amp; 1890) and Polish proverbs (1889–1894). Samuel Ajayi Crowther, the Anglican bishop in Nigeria, published a collection of Yoruba proverbs (1852). Elias Lönnrot published a collection of Finnish proverbs (1842).

From the 20th century onwards, proverb scholars were involved in not only collecting proverbs, but also analyzing and comparing proverbs. Alan Dundes was a 20th century American folklorist whose scholarly output on proverbs led Wolfgang Mieder to refer to him as a &quot;pioneering paremiologist&quot;. Matti Kuusi was a 20th century Finnish paremiologist, the creator of the Matti Kuusi international type system of proverbs. With encouragement from Archer Taylor, he founded the journal &quot;Proverbium: Bulletin d&#x27;Information sur les Recherches Parémiologiques&quot;, published from 1965 to 1975 by the Society for Finnish Literature, which was later restarted as an annual volume, &quot;Proverbium: International Yearbook of Proverb Scholarship&quot;. Archer Taylor was a 20th century American scholar, best known for his &quot;magisterial&quot; book &quot;The Proverb&quot;. Dimitrios Loukatos was a 20th century Greek proverb scholar, author of such works as &quot;Aetiological Tales of Modern Greek Proverbs&quot;. Arvo Krikmann (1939–2017) was an Estonian proverb scholar, whom Wolfgang Mieder called &quot;one of the leading paremiologists in the world&quot; and &quot;master folklorist and paremiologist&quot;. Elisabeth Piirainen was a German scholar with 50 proverb-related publications.

Current proverb scholars have continued the trend to be involved in analysis as well as collection of proverbs. Claude Buridant is a 20th century French scholar whose work has concentrated on Romance languages. Galit Hasan-Rokem is an Israeli scholar, associate editor of &quot;Proverbium: The yearbook of international proverb scholarship&quot;, since 1984. She has written on proverbs in Jewish traditions. Joseph G. Healey is an American Catholic missionary in Kenya who has led a movement to sponsor African proverb scholars to collect proverbs from their own language communities. This led Wolfgang Mieder to dedicate the &quot;International Bibliography of New and Reprinted Proverb Collections&quot; section of &quot;Proverbium&quot; 32 to Healey. Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett is a scholar of Jewish history and folklore, including proverbs. Wolfgang Mieder is a German-born proverb scholar who has worked his entire academic career in the US. He is the editor of &quot;Proverbium&quot; and the author of the two volume &quot;International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology&quot;. He has been honored by four festschrift publications. He has also been recognized by biographical publications that focused on his scholarship. Dora Sakayan is a scholar who has written about German and Armenian studies, including &quot;Armenian Proverbs: A Paremiological Study with an Anthology of 2,500 Armenian Folk Sayings Selected and Translated into English&quot;. An extensive introduction addresses the language and structure, as well as the origin of Armenian proverbs (international, borrowed and specifically Armenian proverbs). Mineke Schipper is a Dutch scholar, best known for her book of worldwide proverbs about women, &quot;Never Marry a Woman with Big Feet – Women in Proverbs from Around the World&quot;. Edward Zellem is an American proverb scholar who has edited books of Afghan proverbs, developed a method of collecting proverbs via the Web.

<text>The portability of social security benefits is the ability of workers to preserve, maintain, and transfer acquired social security rights and social security rights in the process of being acquired from one private, occupational, or public social security scheme to another. Social security rights refer to rights stemming from pension schemes (old age, survivor, disability), unemployment insurance, health insurance, workers&#x27; compensation, and sickness benefits. 

Hence, if social security benefits are portable, contributors to, for example, old-age pension schemes do not experience any disadvantage such as the loss of contributions and benefits associated with these contributions when moving from one job to another, from one occupation to another, or from the public to the private sector or vice versa.

International portability of social security rights allows international migrants, who have contributed to a social security scheme for some time in a particular country, to maintain acquired benefits or benefits in the process of being acquired when moving to another country. International portability of social security benefits is therefore understood as the migrant&#x27;s ability to preserve, maintain, and transfer acquired social security rights independent of nationality and country of residence.

International portability of social security benefits is achieved through bilateral or multilateral social security agreements between countries. These agreements guarantee the totalization of periods of contribution to the social security systems of both countries and the extraterritorial payment of benefits. Currently it is estimated that approximately 23 per cent of migrants worldwide are covered by bilateral social security agreements.

<text>The Percopsiformes are a small order of freshwater teleost fishes measuring less than 20 cm in length, comprising the trout-perch and its allies. It contains just ten extant species, grouped into seven genera and three families. Five of these genera are monotypic.

They inhabit freshwater habitats in North America, and fossil evidence indicates that they have inhabited this region since the Late Cretaceous, with both suborders having diverged by the Maastrichtian. Most species in this order are known from the eastern and central regions of North America, although the two &quot;Percopsis&quot; species have a primarily boreal and western distribution, with &quot;P. omiscomaycus&quot; reaching as far north as the Arctic Circle and &quot;P. transmontana&quot; being restricted to the Pacific Northwest.

They are generally small fish, ranging from in adult body length. They are grouped together because of technical characteristics of their internal anatomy, and the different species may appear quite different externally. Despite their scientific name and the common names for some taxa, they are not closely related to actual perches in the order Perciformes, and rather represent a freshwater lineage of the otherwise almost entirely marine superorder Paracanthopterygii. They are more closely related to the cods, dories, and the deep-sea tube-eye, and fossil evidence suggests that their closest relative was the extinct order Sphenocephaliformes, comprising two enigmatic genera of Late Cretaceous marine fish, as well as &quot;Omosomopsis&quot;, another Cretaceous marine fish from Morocco.

<text>A photon () is an elementary particle that is a quantum of the electromagnetic field, including electromagnetic radiation such as light and radio waves, and the force carrier for the electromagnetic force. Photons are massless particles that can move no faster than the speed of light measured in vacuum. The photon belongs to the class of boson particles.

As with other elementary particles, photons are best explained by quantum mechanics and exhibit wave–particle duality, their behavior featuring properties of both waves and particles. The modern photon concept originated during the first two decades of the 20th century with the work of Albert Einstein, who built upon the research of Max Planck. While Planck was trying to explain how matter and electromagnetic radiation could be in thermal equilibrium with one another, he proposed that the energy stored within a material object should be regarded as composed of an integer number of discrete, equal-sized parts. To explain the photoelectric effect, Einstein introduced the idea that light itself is made of discrete units of energy. In 1926, Gilbert N. Lewis popularized the term &quot;photon&quot; for these energy units. Subsequently, many other experiments validated Einstein&#x27;s approach.

In the Standard Model of particle physics, photons and other elementary particles are described as a necessary consequence of physical laws having a certain symmetry at every point in spacetime. The intrinsic properties of particles, such as charge, mass, and spin, are determined by gauge symmetry. The photon concept has led to momentous advances in experimental and theoretical physics, including lasers, Bose–Einstein condensation, quantum field theory, and the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics. It has been applied to photochemistry, high-resolution microscopy, and measurements of molecular distances. Moreover, photons have been studied as elements of quantum computers, and for applications in optical imaging and optical communication such as quantum cryptography.

==Nomenclature==
The word &quot;quanta&quot; (singular &quot;quantum,&quot; Latin for &quot;&quot;) was used before 1900 to mean particles or amounts of different quantities, including electricity. In 1900, the German physicist Max Planck was studying black-body radiation, and he suggested that the experimental observations, specifically at shorter wavelengths, would be explained if the energy was &quot;made up of a completely determinate number of finite equal parts&quot;, which he called &quot;energy elements&quot;. In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper in which he proposed that many light-related phenomena—including black-body radiation and the photoelectric effect—would be better explained by modelling electromagnetic waves as consisting of spatially localized, discrete energy quanta. He called these &quot;a light quantum&quot; (German: &quot;ein Lichtquant&quot;).

The name &quot;photon&quot; derives from the Greek word for light, &quot;&quot; (transliterated &quot;phôs&quot;). Arthur Compton used &quot;photon&quot; in 1928, referring to Gilbert N. Lewis, who coined the term in a letter to &quot;Nature&quot; on 18 December 1926. The same name was used earlier but was never widely adopted before Lewis: in 1916 by the American physicist and psychologist Leonard T. Troland, in 1921 by the Irish physicist John Joly, in 1924 by the French physiologist René Wurmser (1890–1993), and in 1926 by the French physicist Frithiof Wolfers (1891–1971). The name was suggested initially as a unit related to the illumination of the eye and the resulting sensation of light and was used later in a physiological context. Although Wolfers&#x27;s and Lewis&#x27;s theories were contradicted by many experiments and never accepted, the new name was adopted by most physicists very soon after Compton used it.

In physics, a photon is usually denoted by the symbol  (the Greek letter gamma). This symbol for the photon probably derives from gamma rays, which were discovered in 1900 by Paul Villard, named by Ernest Rutherford in 1903, and shown to be a form of electromagnetic radiation in 1914 by Rutherford and Edward Andrade. In chemistry and optical engineering, photons are usually symbolized by , which is the photon energy, where is the Planck constant and the Greek letter (nu) is the photon&#x27;s frequency.

==Physical properties==
The photon has no electric charge, is generally considered to have zero rest mass and is a stable particle. The experimental upper limit on the photon mass is very small, on the order of 10−50 kg; its lifetime would be more than 1018 years. For comparison the age of the universe is about years. 

In a vacuum, a photon has two possible polarization states. The photon is the gauge boson for electromagnetism, and therefore all other quantum numbers of the photon (such as lepton number, baryon number, and flavour quantum numbers) are zero. Also, the photon obeys Bose–Einstein statistics, and not Fermi–Dirac statistics. That is, they do &quot;not&quot; obey the Pauli exclusion principle and more than one can occupy the same bound quantum state.

Photons are emitted in many natural processes. For example, when a charge is accelerated it emits synchrotron radiation. During a molecular, atomic or nuclear transition to a lower energy level, photons of various energy will be emitted, ranging from radio waves to gamma rays. Photons can also be emitted when a particle and its corresponding antiparticle are annihilated (for example, electron–positron annihilation).

===Relativistic energy and momentum===
In empty space, the photon moves at (the speed of light) and its energy and momentum are related by , where is the magnitude of the momentum vector . This derives from the following relativistic relation, with :
:formula_1

The energy and momentum of a photon depend only on its frequency (formula_2) or inversely, its wavelength ():
:formula_3
:formula_4
where is the wave vector, where
*   is the wave number, and
*   is the angular frequency, and
*   is the reduced Planck constant.

Since formula_5 points in the direction of the photon&#x27;s propagation, the magnitude of its momentum is
:formula_6

===Polarization and spin angular momentum===

The photon also carries spin angular momentum, which is related to photon polarization. (Beams of light also exhibit properties described as orbital angular momentum of light).

The angular momentum of the photon has two possible values, either or . These two possible values correspond to the two possible pure states of circular polarization. Collections of photons in a light beam may have mixtures of these two values; a linearly polarized light beam will act as if it were composed of equal numbers of the two possible angular momenta.

The spin angular momentum of light does not depend on its frequency, and was experimentally verified by C. V. Raman and S. Bhagavantam in 1931.

=== Antiparticle annihilation ===

The collision of a particle with its antiparticle can create photons. In free space at least &quot;two&quot; photons must be created since, in the center of momentum frame, the colliding antiparticles have no net momentum, whereas a single photon always has momentum (determined by the photon&#x27;s frequency or wavelength, which cannot be zero). Hence, conservation of momentum (or equivalently, translational invariance) requires that at least two photons are created, with zero net momentum. The energy of the two photons, or, equivalently, their frequency, may be determined from conservation of four-momentum.

Seen another way, the photon can be considered as its own antiparticle (thus an &quot;antiphoton&quot; is simply a normal photon with opposite momentum, equal polarization, and 180° out of phase). The reverse process, pair production, is the dominant mechanism by which high-energy photons such as gamma rays lose energy while passing through matter. That process is the reverse of &quot;annihilation to one photon&quot; allowed in the electric field of an atomic nucleus.

The classical formulae for the energy and momentum of electromagnetic radiation can be re-expressed in terms of photon events. For example, the pressure of electromagnetic radiation on an object derives from the transfer of photon momentum per unit time and unit area to that object, since pressure is force per unit area and force is the change in momentum per unit time.

===Experimental checks on photon mass===
Current commonly accepted physical theories imply or assume the photon to be strictly massless. If photons were not purely massless, their speeds would vary with frequency, with lower-energy (redder) photons moving slightly slower than higher-energy photons. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called speed of light, &quot;c&quot;, would then not be the actual speed at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on speed that any object could theoretically attain in spacetime. Thus, it would still be the speed of spacetime ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), but it would not be the speed of photons.

If a photon did have non-zero mass, there would be other effects as well. Coulomb&#x27;s law would be modified and the electromagnetic field would have an extra physical degree of freedom. These effects yield more sensitive experimental probes of the photon mass than the frequency dependence of the speed of light. If Coulomb&#x27;s law is not exactly valid, then that would allow the presence of an electric field to exist within a hollow conductor when it is subjected to an external electric field. This provides a means for precision tests of Coulomb&#x27;s law. A null result of such an experiment has set a limit of .

Sharper upper limits on the mass of light have been obtained in experiments designed to detect effects caused by the galactic vector potential. Although the galactic vector potential is large because the galactic magnetic field exists on great length scales, only the magnetic field would be observable if the photon is massless. In the case that the photon has mass, the mass term &quot;m&#x27;A&#x27;A&quot; would affect the galactic plasma. The fact that no such effects are seen implies an upper bound on the photon mass of . The galactic vector potential can also be probed directly by measuring the torque exerted on a magnetized ring. Such methods were used to obtain the sharper upper limit of (the equivalent of ) given by the Particle Data Group.

These sharp limits from the non-observation of the effects caused by the galactic vector potential have been shown to be model-dependent. If the photon mass is generated via the Higgs mechanism then the upper limit of from the test of Coulomb&#x27;s law is valid.
==Historical development==
In most theories up to the eighteenth century, light was pictured as being made of particles. Since particle models cannot easily account for the refraction, diffraction and birefringence of light, wave theories of light were proposed by René Descartes (1637), Robert Hooke (1665), and Christiaan Huygens (1678); however, particle models remained dominant, chiefly due to the influence of Isaac Newton. In the early 19th century, Thomas Young and August Fresnel clearly demonstrated the interference and diffraction of light, and by 1850 wave models were generally accepted. James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s 1865 prediction that light was an electromagnetic wave – which was confirmed experimentally in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz&#x27;s detection of radio waves – seemed to be the final blow to particle models of light.

The Maxwell wave theory, however, does not account for &quot;all&quot; properties of light. The Maxwell theory predicts that the energy of a light wave depends only on its intensity, not on its frequency; nevertheless, several independent types of experiments show that the energy imparted by light to atoms depends only on the light&#x27;s frequency, not on its intensity. For example, some chemical reactions are provoked only by light of frequency higher than a certain threshold; light of frequency lower than the threshold, no matter how intense, does not initiate the reaction. Similarly, electrons can be ejected from a metal plate by shining light of sufficiently high frequency on it (the photoelectric effect); the energy of the ejected electron is related only to the light&#x27;s frequency, not to its intensity.

At the same time, investigations of black-body radiation carried out over four decades (1860–1900) by various researchers culminated in Max Planck&#x27;s hypothesis that the energy of &quot;any&quot; system that absorbs or emits electromagnetic radiation of frequency is an integer multiple of an energy quantum As shown by Albert Einstein, some form of energy quantization &quot;must&quot; be assumed to account for the thermal equilibrium observed between matter and electromagnetic radiation; for this explanation of the photoelectric effect, Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in physics.

Since the Maxwell theory of light allows for all possible energies of electromagnetic radiation, most physicists assumed initially that the energy quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbs or emits the radiation. In 1905, Einstein was the first to propose that energy quantization was a property of electromagnetic radiation itself. Although he accepted the validity of Maxwell&#x27;s theory, Einstein pointed out that many anomalous experiments could be explained if the &quot;energy&quot; of a Maxwellian light wave were localized into point-like quanta that move independently of one another, even if the wave itself is spread continuously over space. In 1909 and 1916, Einstein showed that, if Planck&#x27;s law regarding black-body radiation is accepted, the energy quanta must also carry momentum making them full-fledged particles. This photon momentum was observed experimentally by Arthur Compton, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1927. The pivotal question then, was how to unify Maxwell&#x27;s wave theory of light with its experimentally observed particle nature. The answer to this question occupied Albert Einstein for the rest of his life, and was solved in quantum electrodynamics and its successor, the Standard Model. (See &#x27; and &#x27;, below.)

Einstein&#x27;s 1905 predictions were verified experimentally in several ways in the first two decades of the 20th century, as recounted in Robert Millikan&#x27;s Nobel lecture. However, before Compton&#x27;s experiment showed that photons carried momentum proportional to their wave number (1922), most physicists were reluctant to believe that electromagnetic radiation itself might be particulate. (See, for example, the Nobel lectures of Wien, Planck and Millikan.) Instead, there was a widespread belief that energy quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbed or emitted radiation. Attitudes changed over time. In part, the change can be traced to experiments such as those revealing Compton scattering, where it was much more difficult not to ascribe quantization to light itself to explain the observed results.

Even after Compton&#x27;s experiment, Niels Bohr, Hendrik Kramers and John Slater made one last attempt to preserve the Maxwellian continuous electromagnetic field model of light, the so-called BKS theory. An important feature of the BKS theory is how it treated the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum. In the BKS theory, energy and momentum are only conserved on the average across many interactions between matter and radiation. However, refined Compton experiments showed that the conservation laws hold for individual interactions. Accordingly, Bohr and his co-workers gave their model &quot;as honorable a funeral as possible&quot;. Nevertheless, the failures of the BKS model inspired Werner Heisenberg in his development of matrix mechanics.

A few physicists persisted in developing semiclassical models in which electromagnetic radiation is not quantized, but matter appears to obey the laws of quantum mechanics. Although the evidence from chemical and physical experiments for the existence of photons was overwhelming by the 1970s, this evidence could not be considered as &quot;absolutely&quot; definitive; since it relied on the interaction of light with matter, and a sufficiently complete theory of matter could in principle account for the evidence. Nevertheless, &quot;all&quot; semiclassical theories were refuted definitively in the 1970s and 1980s by photon-correlation experiments. Hence, Einstein&#x27;s hypothesis that quantization is a property of light itself is considered to be proven.

==Wave–particle duality and uncertainty principles==

Photons obey the laws of quantum mechanics, and so their behavior has both wave-like and particle-like aspects. When a photon is detected by a measuring instrument, it is registered as a single, particulate unit. However, the &quot;probability&quot; of detecting a photon is calculated by equations that describe waves. This combination of aspects is known as wave–particle duality. For example, the probability distribution for the location at which a photon might be detected displays clearly wave-like phenomena such as diffraction and interference. A single photon passing through a double slit has its energy received at a point on the screen with a probability distribution given by its interference pattern determined by Maxwell&#x27;s wave equations. However, experiments confirm that the photon is &quot;not&quot; a short pulse of electromagnetic radiation; a photon&#x27;s Maxwell waves will diffract, but photon energy does not spread out as it propagates, nor does this energy divide when it encounters a beam splitter. Rather, the received photon acts like a point-like particle since it is absorbed or emitted &quot;as a whole&quot; by arbitrarily small systems, including systems much smaller than its wavelength, such as an atomic nucleus (≈10−15 m across) or even the point-like electron.

While many introductory texts treat photons using the mathematical techniques of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, this is in some ways an awkward oversimplification, as photons are by nature intrinsically relativistic. Because photons have zero rest mass, no wave function defined for a photon can have all the properties familiar from wave functions in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. In order to avoid these difficulties, physicists employ the second-quantized theory of photons described below, quantum electrodynamics, in which photons are quantized excitations of electromagnetic modes.

Another difficulty is finding the proper analogue for the uncertainty principle, an idea frequently attributed to Heisenberg, who introduced the concept in analyzing a thought experiment involving an electron and a high-energy photon. However, Heisenberg did not give precise mathematical definitions of what the &quot;uncertainty&quot; in these measurements meant. The precise mathematical statement of the position–momentum uncertainty principle is due to Kennard, Pauli, and Weyl. The uncertainty principle applies to situations where an experimenter has a choice of measuring either one of two &quot;canonically conjugate&quot; quantities, like the position and the momentum of a particle. According to the uncertainty principle, no matter how the particle is prepared, it is not possible to make a precise prediction for both of the two alternative measurements: if the outcome of the position measurement is made more certain, the outcome of the momentum measurement becomes less so, and vice versa. A coherent state minimizes the overall uncertainty as far as quantum mechanics allows. Quantum optics makes use of coherent states for modes of the electromagnetic field. There is a tradeoff, reminiscent of the position–momentum uncertainty relation, between measurements of an electromagnetic wave&#x27;s amplitude and its phase. This is sometimes informally expressed in terms of the uncertainty in the number of photons present in the electromagnetic wave, formula_7, and the uncertainty in the phase of the wave, formula_8. However, this cannot be an uncertainty relation of the Kennard–Pauli–Weyl type, since unlike position and momentum, the phase formula_9 cannot be represented by a Hermitian operator.

==Bose–Einstein model of a photon gas==
In 1924, Satyendra Nath Bose derived Planck&#x27;s law of black-body radiation without using any electromagnetism, but rather by using a modification of coarse-grained counting of phase space. Einstein showed that this modification is equivalent to assuming that photons are rigorously identical and that it implied a &quot;mysterious non-local interaction&quot;, now understood as the requirement for a symmetric quantum mechanical state. This work led to the concept of coherent states and the development of the laser. In the same papers, Einstein extended Bose&#x27;s formalism to material particles (bosons) and predicted that they would condense into their lowest quantum state at low enough temperatures; this Bose–Einstein condensation was observed experimentally in 1995. It was later used by Lene Hau to slow, and then completely stop, light in 1999 and 2001.

The modern view on this is that photons are, by virtue of their integer spin, bosons (as opposed to fermions with half-integer spin). By the spin-statistics theorem, all bosons obey Bose–Einstein statistics (whereas all fermions obey Fermi–Dirac statistics).

==Stimulated and spontaneous emission==

In 1916, Albert Einstein showed that Planck&#x27;s radiation law could be derived from a semi-classical, statistical treatment of photons and atoms, which implies a link between the rates at which atoms emit and absorb photons. The condition follows from the assumption that functions of the emission and absorption of radiation by the atoms are independent of each other, and that thermal equilibrium is made by way of the radiation&#x27;s interaction with the atoms. Consider a cavity in thermal equilibrium with all parts of itself and filled with electromagnetic radiation and that the atoms can emit and absorb that radiation. Thermal equilibrium requires that the energy density formula_10 of photons with frequency formula_2 (which is proportional to their number density) is, on average, constant in time; hence, the rate at which photons of any particular frequency are &quot;emitted&quot; must equal the rate at which they are &quot;absorbed&quot;.

Einstein began by postulating simple proportionality relations for the different reaction rates involved. In his model, the rate formula_12 for a system to &quot;absorb&quot; a photon of frequency formula_2 and transition from a lower energy formula_14 to a higher energy formula_15 is proportional to the number formula_16 of atoms with energy formula_14 and to the energy density formula_10 of ambient photons of that frequency,

:formula_19

where formula_20 is the rate constant for absorption. For the reverse process, there are two possibilities: spontaneous emission of a photon, or the emission of a photon initiated by the interaction of the atom with a passing photon and the return of the atom to the lower-energy state. Following Einstein&#x27;s approach, the corresponding rate formula_21 for the emission of photons of frequency formula_2 and transition from a higher energy formula_15 to a lower energy formula_14 is

:formula_25

where formula_26 is the rate constant for emitting a photon spontaneously, and formula_27 is the rate constant for emissions in response to ambient photons (induced or stimulated emission). In thermodynamic equilibrium, the number of atoms in state formula_28 and those in state formula_29 must, on average, be constant; hence, the rates formula_12 and formula_21 must be equal. Also, by arguments analogous to the derivation of Boltzmann statistics, the ratio of formula_32 and formula_16 is formula_34 where formula_35 and formula_36 are the degeneracy of the state formula_28 and that of formula_29, respectively, formula_39 and formula_40 their energies, formula_41 the Boltzmann constant and formula_42 the system&#x27;s temperature. From this, it is readily derived that

formula_43 and
:formula_44
The formula_26 and formula_27 are collectively known as the &quot;Einstein coefficients&quot;.

Einstein could not fully justify his rate equations, but claimed that it should be possible to calculate the coefficients formula_26, formula_20 and formula_27 once physicists had obtained &quot;mechanics and electrodynamics modified to accommodate the quantum hypothesis&quot;. Not long thereafter, in 1926, Paul Dirac derived the formula_27 rate constants by using a semiclassical approach, and, in 1927, succeeded in deriving &quot;all&quot; the rate constants from first principles within the framework of quantum theory. Dirac&#x27;s work was the foundation of quantum electrodynamics, i.e., the quantization of the electromagnetic field itself. Dirac&#x27;s approach is also called &quot;second quantization&quot; or quantum field theory; earlier quantum mechanical treatments only treat material particles as quantum mechanical, not the electromagnetic field.

Einstein was troubled by the fact that his theory seemed incomplete, since it did not determine the &quot;direction&quot; of a spontaneously emitted photon. A probabilistic nature of light-particle motion was first considered by Newton in his treatment of birefringence and, more generally, of the splitting of light beams at interfaces into a transmitted beam and a reflected beam. Newton hypothesized that hidden variables in the light particle determined which of the two paths a single photon would take. Similarly, Einstein hoped for a more complete theory that would leave nothing to chance, beginning his separation from quantum mechanics. Ironically, Max Born&#x27;s probabilistic interpretation of the wave function was inspired by Einstein&#x27;s later work searching for a more complete theory.

==Quantum field theory==
===Quantization of the electromagnetic field===

In 1910, Peter Debye derived Planck&#x27;s law of black-body radiation from a relatively simple assumption. He decomposed the electromagnetic field in a cavity into its Fourier modes, and assumed that the energy in any mode was an integer multiple of formula_51, where formula_2 is the frequency of the electromagnetic mode. Planck&#x27;s law of black-body radiation follows immediately as a geometric sum. However, Debye&#x27;s approach failed to give the correct formula for the energy fluctuations of black-body radiation, which were derived by Einstein in 1909.

In 1925, Born, Heisenberg and Jordan reinterpreted Debye&#x27;s concept in a key way. As may be shown classically, the Fourier modes of the electromagnetic field—a complete set of electromagnetic plane waves indexed by their wave vector k and polarization state—are equivalent to a set of uncoupled simple harmonic oscillators. Treated quantum mechanically, the energy levels of such oscillators are known to be formula_53, where formula_2 is the oscillator frequency. The key new step was to identify an electromagnetic mode with energy formula_53 as a state with formula_56 photons, each of energy formula_51. This approach gives the correct energy fluctuation formula.

Dirac took this one step further. He treated the interaction between a charge and an electromagnetic field as a small perturbation that induces transitions in the photon states, changing the numbers of photons in the modes, while conserving energy and momentum overall. Dirac was able to derive Einstein&#x27;s formula_26 and formula_27 coefficients from first principles, and showed that the Bose–Einstein statistics of photons is a natural consequence of quantizing the electromagnetic field correctly (Bose&#x27;s reasoning went in the opposite direction; he derived Planck&#x27;s law of black-body radiation by &quot;assuming&quot; B–E statistics). In Dirac&#x27;s time, it was not yet known that all bosons, including photons, must obey Bose–Einstein statistics.

Dirac&#x27;s second-order perturbation theory can involve virtual photons, transient intermediate states of the electromagnetic field; the static electric and magnetic interactions are mediated by such virtual photons. In such quantum field theories, the probability amplitude of observable events is calculated by summing over &quot;all&quot; possible intermediate steps, even ones that are unphysical; hence, virtual photons are not constrained to satisfy formula_60, and may have extra polarization states; depending on the gauge used, virtual photons may have three or four polarization states, instead of the two states of real photons. Although these transient virtual photons can never be observed, they contribute measurably to the probabilities of observable events.

Indeed, such second-order and higher-order perturbation calculations can give apparently infinite contributions to the sum. Such unphysical results are corrected for using the technique of renormalization.

Other virtual particles may contribute to the summation as well; for example, two photons may interact indirectly through virtual electron–positron pairs. Such photon–photon scattering (see two-photon physics), as well as electron–photon scattering, is meant to be one of the modes of operations of the planned particle accelerator, the International Linear Collider.

In modern physics notation, the quantum state of the electromagnetic field is written as a Fock state, a tensor product of the states for each electromagnetic mode

:formula_61

where formula_62 represents the state in which formula_63 photons are in the mode formula_64. In this notation, the creation of a new photon in mode formula_64 (e.g., emitted from an atomic transition) is written as formula_66. This notation merely expresses the concept of Born, Heisenberg and Jordan described above, and does not add any physics.

===As a gauge boson===
The electromagnetic field can be understood as a gauge field, i.e., as a field that results from requiring that a gauge symmetry holds independently at every position in spacetime. For the electromagnetic field, this gauge symmetry is the Abelian U(1) symmetry of complex numbers of absolute value 1, which reflects the ability to vary the phase of a complex field without affecting observables or real valued functions made from it, such as the energy or the Lagrangian.

The quanta of an Abelian gauge field must be massless, uncharged bosons, as long as the symmetry is not broken; hence, the photon is predicted to be massless, and to have zero electric charge and integer spin. The particular form of the electromagnetic interaction specifies that the photon must have spin ±1; thus, its helicity must be formula_67. These two spin components correspond to the classical concepts of right-handed and left-handed circularly polarized light. However, the transient virtual photons of quantum electrodynamics may also adopt unphysical polarization states.

In the prevailing Standard Model of physics, the photon is one of four gauge bosons in the electroweak interaction; the other three are denoted W+, W− and Z0 and are responsible for the weak interaction. Unlike the photon, these gauge bosons have mass, owing to a mechanism that breaks their SU(2) gauge symmetry. The unification of the photon with W and Z gauge bosons in the electroweak interaction was accomplished by Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg, for which they were awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in physics. Physicists continue to hypothesize grand unified theories that connect these four gauge bosons with the eight gluon gauge bosons of quantum chromodynamics; however, key predictions of these theories, such as proton decay, have not been observed experimentally.

===Hadronic properties===

Measurements of the interaction between energetic photons and hadrons show that the interaction is much more intense than expected by the interaction of merely photons with the hadron&#x27;s electric charge. Furthermore, the interaction of energetic photons with protons is similar to the interaction of photons with neutrons in spite of the fact that the electrical charge structures of protons and neutrons are substantially different. A theory called Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) was developed to explain this effect. According to VMD, the photon is a superposition of the pure electromagnetic photon, which interacts only with electric charges, and vector mesons, which mediate the residual nuclear force. However, if experimentally probed at very short distances, the intrinsic structure of the photon appears to have as components a charge-neutral flux of quarks and gluons, quasi-free according to asymptotic freedom in QCD. That flux is described by the &quot;photon structure function&quot;. A review by presented a comprehensive comparison of data with theoretical predictions.

===Contributions to the mass of a system===

The energy of a system that emits a photon is &quot;decreased&quot; by the energy formula_68 of the photon as measured in the rest frame of the emitting system, which may result in a reduction in mass in the amount formula_69. Similarly, the mass of a system that absorbs a photon is &quot;increased&quot; by a corresponding amount. As an application, the energy balance of nuclear reactions involving photons is commonly written in terms of the masses of the nuclei involved, and terms of the form formula_69 for the gamma photons (and for other relevant energies, such as the recoil energy of nuclei).

This concept is applied in key predictions of quantum electrodynamics (QED, see above). In that theory, the mass of electrons (or, more generally, leptons) is modified by including the mass contributions of virtual photons, in a technique known as renormalization. Such &quot;radiative corrections&quot; contribute to a number of predictions of QED, such as the magnetic dipole moment of leptons, the Lamb shift, and the hyperfine structure of bound lepton pairs, such as muonium and positronium.

Since photons contribute to the stress–energy tensor, they exert a gravitational attraction on other objects, according to the theory of general relativity. Conversely, photons are themselves affected by gravity; their normally straight trajectories may be bent by warped spacetime, as in gravitational lensing, and their frequencies may be lowered by moving to a higher gravitational potential, as in the Pound–Rebka experiment. However, these effects are not specific to photons; exactly the same effects would be predicted for classical electromagnetic waves.

==In matter==
Light that travels through transparent matter does so at a lower speed than &quot;c&quot;, the speed of light in vacuum. The factor by which the speed is decreased is called the refractive index of the material. In a classical wave picture, the slowing can be explained by the light inducing electric polarization in the matter, the polarized matter radiating new light, and that new light interfering with the original light wave to form a delayed wave. In a particle picture, the slowing can instead be described as a blending of the photon with quantum excitations of the matter to produce quasi-particles known as polaritons. Polaritons have a nonzero effective mass, which means that they cannot travel at &quot;c&quot;. Light of different frequencies may travel through matter at different speeds; this is called dispersion (not to be confused with scattering). In some cases, it can result in extremely slow speeds of light in matter. The effects of photon interactions with other quasi-particles may be observed directly in Raman scattering and Brillouin scattering.

Photons can be scattered by matter. For example, photons scatter so many times in the solar radiative zone after leaving the core of the Sun that radiant energy takes about a million years to reach the convection zone. However, photons emitted from the sun&#x27;s photosphere take only 8.3 minutes to reach Earth.

Photons can also be absorbed by nuclei, atoms or molecules, provoking transitions between their energy levels. A classic example is the molecular transition of retinal (C20H28O), which is responsible for vision, as discovered in 1958 by Nobel laureate biochemist George Wald and co-workers. The absorption provokes a cis–trans isomerization that, in combination with other such transitions, is transduced into nerve impulses. The absorption of photons can even break chemical bonds, as in the photodissociation of chlorine; this is the subject of photochemistry.

==Technological applications==
Photons have many applications in technology. These examples are chosen to illustrate applications of photons &quot;per se&quot;, rather than general optical devices such as lenses, etc. that could operate under a classical theory of light. The laser is an important application and is discussed above under stimulated emission.

Individual photons can be detected by several methods. The classic photomultiplier tube exploits the photoelectric effect: a photon of sufficient energy strikes a metal plate and knocks free an electron, initiating an ever-amplifying avalanche of electrons. Semiconductor charge-coupled device chips use a similar effect: an incident photon generates a charge on a microscopic capacitor that can be detected. Other detectors such as Geiger counters use the ability of photons to ionize gas molecules contained in the device, causing a detectable change of conductivity of the gas.

Planck&#x27;s energy formula formula_71 is often used by engineers and chemists in design, both to compute the change in energy resulting from a photon absorption and to determine the frequency of the light emitted from a given photon emission. For example, the emission spectrum of a gas-discharge lamp can be altered by filling it with (mixtures of) gases with different electronic energy level configurations.

Under some conditions, an energy transition can be excited by &quot;two&quot; photons that individually would be insufficient. This allows for higher resolution microscopy, because the sample absorbs energy only in the spectrum where two beams of different colors overlap significantly, which can be made much smaller than the excitation volume of a single beam (see two-photon excitation microscopy). Moreover, these photons cause less damage to the sample, since they are of lower energy.

In some cases, two energy transitions can be coupled so that, as one system absorbs a photon, another nearby system &quot;steals&quot; its energy and re-emits a photon of a different frequency. This is the basis of fluorescence resonance energy transfer, a technique that is used in molecular biology to study the interaction of suitable proteins.

Several different kinds of hardware random number generators involve the detection of single photons. In one example, for each bit in the random sequence that is to be produced, a photon is sent to a beam-splitter. In such a situation, there are two possible outcomes of equal probability. The actual outcome is used to determine whether the next bit in the sequence is &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot;.

==Quantum optics and computation==
Much research has been devoted to applications of photons in the field of quantum optics. Photons seem well-suited to be elements of an extremely fast quantum computer, and the quantum entanglement of photons is a focus of research. Nonlinear optical processes are another active research area, with topics such as two-photon absorption, self-phase modulation, modulational instability and optical parametric oscillators. However, such processes generally do not require the assumption of photons &quot;per se&quot;; they may often be modeled by treating atoms as nonlinear oscillators. The nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric down conversion is often used to produce single-photon states. Finally, photons are essential in some aspects of optical communication, especially for quantum cryptography.

Two-photon physics studies interactions between photons, which are rare. In 2018, Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers announced the discovery of bound photon triplets, which may involve polaritons.

<text>Philipp Franz Balthasar von Siebold (17 February 1796 – 18 October 1866) was a German physician, botanist and traveller. He achieved prominence by his studies of Japanese flora and fauna and the introduction of Western medicine in Japan. He was the father of the first female Japanese doctor educated in Western medicine, Kusumoto Ine.

==Career==



===Early life===
Born into a family of doctors and professors of medicine in Würzburg (then in the Prince-Bishopric of Würzburg, later part of Bavaria), Siebold initially studied medicine at the University of Würzburg from November 1815, where he became a member of the Corps Moenania Würzburg. One of his professors was Franz Xaver Heller (1775–1840), author of the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Flora of the Grand Duchy of Würzburg&quot;, 1810–1811). Ignaz Döllinger (1770–1841), his professor of anatomy and physiology, however, most influenced him. Döllinger was one of the first professors to understand and treat medicine as a natural science. Siebold stayed with Döllinger, where he came in regular contact with other scientists. He read the books of Humboldt, a famous naturalist and explorer, which probably raised his desire to travel to distant lands. Philipp Franz von Siebold became a physician by earning his M.D. degree in 1820. He initially practiced medicine in Heidingsfeld, in the Kingdom of Bavaria, now part of Würzburg.

Invited to Holland by an acquaintance of his family, Siebold applied for a position as a military physician, which would enable him to travel to the Dutch colonies. He entered the Dutch military service on 19 June 1822, and was appointed as ship&#x27;s surgeon on the frigate &quot;Adriana&quot;, sailing from Rotterdam to Batavia (present-day Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies (now called Indonesia). On his trip to Batavia on the frigate &quot;Adriana&quot;, Siebold practiced his knowledge of the Dutch language and also rapidly learned Malay. During the long voyage he also began a collection of marine fauna. He arrived in Batavia on 18 February 1823.

As an army medical officer, Siebold was posted to an artillery unit. However, he was given a room for a few weeks at the residence of the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Baron Godert van der Capellen, to recover from an illness. With his erudition, he impressed the Governor-General, and also the director of the botanical garden at Buitenzorg (now Bogor), Caspar Georg Carl Reinwardt. These men sensed in Siebold a worthy successor to Engelbert Kaempfer and Carl Peter Thunberg, two former resident physicians at Dejima, a Dutch trading post in Japan, the former of whom was the author of &quot;&quot;. The Batavian Academy of Arts and Sciences soon elected Siebold as a member.

===Arrival in Japan===
On 28 June 1823, after only a few months in the Dutch East Indies, Siebold was posted as resident physician and scientist to Dejima, a small artificial island and trading post at Nagasaki, and arrived there on 11 August 1823. During an eventful voyage to Japan he only just escaped drowning during a typhoon in the East China Sea. As only a very small number of Dutch personnel were allowed to live on this island, the posts of physician and scientist had to be combined. Dejima had been in the possession of the Dutch East India Company (known as the VOC) since the 17th century, but the Company had gone bankrupt in 1798, after which a trading post was operated there by the Dutch state for political considerations, with notable benefits to the Japanese.

The European tradition of sending doctors with botanical training to Japan was a long one. Sent on a mission by the Dutch East India Company, Engelbert Kaempfer (1651–1716), a German physician and botanist who lived in Japan from 1690 until 1692, ushered in this tradition of a combination of physician and botanist. The Dutch East India Company did not, however, actually employ the Swedish botanist and physician Carl Peter Thunberg (1743–1828), who had arrived in Japan in 1775.

===Medical practice===
Japanese scientists invited Siebold to show them the marvels of western science, and he learned in return through them much about the Japanese and their customs. After curing an influential local officer, Siebold gained the permission to leave the trade post. He used this opportunity to treat Japanese patients in the greater area around the trade post. Siebold is credited with the introduction of vaccination and pathological anatomy for the first time in Japan.

In 1824, Siebold started a medical school in Nagasaki, the &quot;Narutaki-juku&quot;, that grew into a meeting place for around fifty &quot;students&quot;. They helped him in his botanical and naturalistic studies. The Dutch language became the &quot;lingua franca&quot; (common spoken language) for these academic and scholarly contacts for a generation, until the Meiji Restoration.

His patients paid him in kind with a variety of objects and artifacts that would later gain historical significance. These everyday objects later became the basis of his large ethnographic collection, which consisted of everyday household goods, woodblock prints, tools and hand-crafted objects used by the Japanese people.

===Japanese family===
During his stay in Japan, Siebold &quot;lived together&quot; with Kusumoto Taki (楠本滝), who gave birth to their daughter Kusumoto (O-)Ine in 1827. Siebold used to call his wife &quot;Otakusa&quot; (probably derived from O-Taki-san) and named a &quot;Hydrangea&quot; after her. Kusumoto Ine eventually became the first Japanese woman known to have received a physician&#x27;s training and became a highly regarded practicing physician and court physician to the Empress in 1882. She died at court in 1903.

===Studies of Japanese fauna and flora===
His main interest, however, focused on the study of Japanese fauna and flora. He collected as much material as he could. Starting a small botanical garden behind his home (there was not much room on the small island) Siebold amassed over 1,000 native plants. In a specially built glasshouse he cultivated the Japanese plants to endure the Dutch climate. Local Japanese artists like Kawahara Keiga drew and painted images of these plants, creating botanical illustrations but also images of the daily life in Japan, which complemented his ethnographic collection. He hired Japanese hunters to track rare animals and collect specimens. Many specimens were collected with the help of his Japanese collaborators Keisuke Ito (1803–1901), Mizutani Sugeroku (1779–1833), Ōkochi Zonshin (1796–1882) and Katsuragawa Hoken (1797–1844), a physician to the &quot;shōgun&quot;. As well, Siebold&#x27;s assistant and later successor, Heinrich Bürger (1806–1858), proved to be indispensable in carrying on Siebold&#x27;s work in Japan.

Siebold first introduced to Europe such familiar garden-plants as the &quot;Hosta&quot; and the &quot;Hydrangea otaksa&quot;. Unknown to the Japanese, he was also able to smuggle out germinative seeds of tea plants to the botanical garden &quot;&quot; in Batavia. Through this single act, he started the tea culture in Java, a Dutch colony at the time. Until then Japan had strictly guarded the trade in tea plants. Remarkably, in 1833, Java already could boast a half million tea plants.

He also introduced Japanese knotweed (&quot;Reynoutria japonica&quot;, syn. &quot;Fallopia japonica&quot;), which has become a highly invasive weed in Europe and North America. All derive from a single female plant collected by Siebold.

During his stay at Dejima, Siebold sent three shipments with an unknown number of herbarium specimens to Leiden, Ghent, Brussels and Antwerp. The shipment to Leiden contained the first specimens of the Japanese giant salamander (&quot;Andrias japonicus&quot;) to be sent to Europe.

In 1825 the government of the Dutch-Indies provided him with two assistants: apothecary and mineralogist Heinrich Bürger (his later successor) and the painter Carl Hubert de Villeneuve. Each would prove to be useful to Siebold&#x27;s efforts that ranged from ethnographical to botanical to horticultural, when attempting to document the exotic Eastern Japanese experience. De Villeneuve taught Kawahara the techniques of Western painting.

Reportedly, Siebold was not the easiest man to deal with. He was in continuous conflict with his Dutch superiors who felt he was arrogant. This threat of conflict resulted in his recall in July 1827 back to Batavia. But the ship, the &quot;Cornelis Houtman&quot;, sent to carry him back to Batavia, was thrown ashore by a typhoon in Nagasaki bay. The same storm badly damaged Dejima and destroyed Siebold&#x27;s botanical garden. Repaired, the &quot;Cornelis Houtman&quot; was refloated. It left for Batavia with 89 crates of Siebold&#x27;s salvaged botanical collection, but Siebold himself remained behind in Dejima.

===Siebold Incident===
In 1826 Siebold made the court journey to Edo. During this long trip he collected many plants and animals. But he also obtained from the court astronomer Takahashi Kageyasu several detailed maps of Japan and Korea (written by Inō Tadataka), an act strictly forbidden by the Japanese government. When the Japanese discovered, by accident, that Siebold had a map of the northern parts of Japan, the government accused him of high treason and of being a spy for Russia.

The Japanese placed Siebold under house arrest and expelled him from Japan on 22 October 1829. Satisfied that his Japanese collaborators would continue his work, he journeyed back on the frigate &quot;Java&quot; to his former residence, Batavia, in possession of his enormous collection of thousands of animals and plants, his books and his maps. The botanical garden of &quot;&quot; would soon house Siebold&#x27;s surviving, living flora collection of 2,000 plants. He arrived in the Netherlands on 7 July 1830. His stay in Japan and Batavia had lasted for a period of eight years.

===Return to Europe===
Philipp Franz von Siebold arrived in the Netherlands in 1830, just at a time when political troubles erupted in Brussels, leading soon to Belgian independence. Hastily he salvaged his ethnographic collections in Antwerp and his herbarium specimens in Brussels and took them to Leiden, helped by Johann Baptist Fischer. He left behind his botanical collections of living plants that were sent to the University of Ghent. The consequent expansion of this collection of rare and exotic plants led to the horticultural fame of Ghent. In gratitude the University of Ghent presented him in 1841 with specimens of every plant from his original collection.

Siebold settled in Leiden, taking with him the major part of his collection. The &quot;Philipp Franz von Siebold collection&quot;, containing many type specimens, was the earliest botanical collection from Japan. Even today, it still remains a subject of ongoing research, a testimony to the depth of work undertaken by Siebold. It contained about 12,000 specimens, from which he could describe only about 2,300 species. The whole collection was purchased for a handsome amount by the Dutch government. Siebold was also granted a substantial annual allowance by the Dutch King William II and was appointed &quot;Advisor to the King for Japanese Affairs&quot;. In 1842, the King even raised Siebold to the nobility as an esquire.

The &quot;Siebold collection&quot; opened to the public in 1831. He founded a museum in his home in 1837. This small, private museum would eventually evolve into the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden. Siebold&#x27;s successor in Japan, Heinrich Bürger, sent Siebold three more shipments of herbarium specimens collected in Japan. This flora collection formed the basis of the Japanese collections of the National Herbarium of the Netherlands in Leiden, while the zoological specimens Siebold collected were kept by the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie (&quot;National Museum of Natural History&quot;) in Leiden, which later became Naturalis. Both institutions merged into Naturalis Biodiversity Center in 2010, which now maintains the entire natural history collection that Siebold brought back to Leiden.

In 1845 Siebold married Helene von Gagern (1820–1877), they had three sons and two daughters.

===Writings===
During his stay in Leiden, Siebold wrote &quot;Nippon&quot; in 1832, the first part of a volume of a richly illustrated ethnographical and geographical work on Japan. The &quot;Archiv zur Beschreibung Nippons&quot; also contained a report of his journey to the Shogunate Court at Edo. He wrote six further parts, the last ones published posthumously in 1882; his sons published an edited and lower-priced reprint in 1887.

The &quot; appeared between 1833 and 1841. This work was co-authored by Joseph Hoffmann and Kuo Cheng-Chang, a Javanese of Chinese extraction, who had journeyed along with Siebold from Batavia. It contained a survey of Japanese literature and a Chinese, Japanese and Korean dictionary. Siebold&#x27;s writing on Japanese religion and customs notably shaped early modern European conceptions of Buddhism and Shinto; he notably suggested that Japanese Buddhism was a form of Monotheism.

The zoologists Coenraad Temminck (1777–1858), Hermann Schlegel (1804–1884), and Wilhem de Haan (1801–1855) scientifically described and documented Siebold&#x27;s collection of Japanese animals. The &#x27;, a series of monographs published between 1833 and 1850, was mainly based on Siebold&#x27;s collection, making the Japanese fauna the best-described non-European fauna – &quot;a remarkable feat&quot;. A significant part of the &#x27; was also based on the collections of Siebold&#x27;s successor on Dejima, Heinrich Bürger.

Siebold wrote his &quot;&quot; in collaboration with the German botanist Joseph Gerhard Zuccarini (1797–1848). It first appeared in 1835, but the work was not completed until after his death, finished in 1870 by F.A.W. Miquel (1811–1871), director of the Rijksherbarium in Leiden. This work expanded Siebold&#x27;s scientific fame from Japan to Europe.

From the Hortus Botanicus Leiden – the botanical garden of Leiden – many of Siebold&#x27;s plants spread to Europe and from there to other countries. &quot;Hosta&quot; and &quot;Hortensia&quot;, &quot;Azalea&quot;, and the Japanese butterbur and the coltsfoot as well as the Japanese larch began to inhabit gardens across the world.

===International endeavours===

After his return to Europe, Siebold tried to exploit his knowledge of Japan. Whilst living in Boppard, from 1852 he corresponded with Russian diplomats such as Baron von Budberg-Bönninghausen, the Russian ambassador to Prussia, which resulted in an invitation to go to St Petersburg to advise the Russian government how to open trade relations with Japan. Though still employed by the Dutch government he did not inform the Dutch of this voyage until after his return.

American Naval Commodore Matthew C. Perry consulted Siebold in advance of his voyage to Japan in 1854. He notably advised Townsend Harris on how Christianity might be spread to Japan, alleging based on his time there that the Japanese &quot;hated&quot; Christianity.

In 1858, the Japanese government lifted the banishment of Siebold. He returned to Japan in 1859 as an adviser to the Agent of the Dutch Trading Society (Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij) in Nagasaki, Albert Bauduin. After two years the connection with the Trading Society was severed as the advice of Siebold was considered to be of no value. In Nagasaki he fathered another child with one of his female servants.

In 1861 Siebold organised his appointment as an adviser to the Japanese government and went in that function to Edo. There he tried to obtain a position between the foreign representatives and the Japanese government. As he had been specially admonished by the Dutch authorities before going to Japan that he was to abstain from all interference in politics, the Dutch Consul General in Japan, J.K. de Wit, was ordered to ask Siebold&#x27;s removal. Siebold was ordered to return to Batavia and from there he returned to Europe.

After his return he asked the Dutch government to employ him as Consul General in Japan but the Dutch government severed all relations with Siebold who had a huge debt because of loans given to him, except for the payment of his pension.

Siebold kept trying to organise another voyage to Japan. After he did not succeed in gaining employment with the Russian government, he went to Paris in 1865 to try to interest the French government in funding another expedition to Japan, but failed. He died in Munich on 18 October 1866.

==Legacy==
===Plants named after Siebold===
The botanical and horticultural spheres of influence have honored Philipp Franz von Siebold by naming some of the very garden-worthy plants that he studied after him. Examples include:

* &quot;Acer sieboldianum&quot; or Siebold&#x27;s Maple: a variety of maple native to Japan
* &quot;Calanthe sieboldii&quot; or Siebold&#x27;s Calanthe is a terrestrial evergreen orchid native to Japan, the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan.
* &quot;Clematis florida&quot; var. &quot;sieboldiana&quot; (syn: &quot;C. florida&quot; &#x27;Sieboldii&#x27; &amp; &quot;C. florida&quot; &#x27;Bicolor&#x27;): a somewhat difficult &quot;Clematis&quot; to grow &quot;well&quot; but a much sought after plant nevertheless
* &quot;&quot;: (Asian beaked hazel) is a species of nut found in northeastern Asia and Japan
* &quot;Dryopteris sieboldii&quot;: a fern with leathery fronds
* &quot;Hosta sieboldii&quot; of which a large garden may have a dozen quite distinct cultivars
* &quot;Magnolia sieboldii&quot;: the under-appreciated small &quot;Oyama&quot; magnolia
* &quot;Malus sieboldii&quot;: the fragrant Toringo Crab-Apple, (originally called &quot;Sorbus toringo&quot; by Siebold), whose pink buds fade to white
* &quot;Primula sieboldii&quot;: the Japanese woodland primula &quot;Sakurasou&quot; (Chinese/Japanese: 櫻草)
* &quot;Prunus sieboldii&quot;: a flowering cherry
* &quot;Sedum sieboldii&quot;: a succulent whose leaves form rose-like whorls
* &quot;Tsuga sieboldii&quot;: a Japanese hemlock
* &quot;Viburnum sieboldii&quot;: a deciduous large shrub that has creamy white flowers in spring and red berries that ripen to black in autumn

===Animals named after Siebold===
*&quot;Enhydris sieboldii&quot; or Siebold&#x27;s smooth water snake
* A type of abalone, &quot;Nordotis gigantea&quot;, is known as Siebold&#x27;s abalone, and is prized for sushi.
* A genus of large gomphid dragonflies, &quot;Sieboldius&quot;

===Further legacy===
Though he is well known in Japan, where he is called &quot;Shiboruto-san&quot;, and although mentioned in the relevant schoolbooks, Siebold is almost unknown elsewhere, except among gardeners who admire the many plants whose names incorporate &quot;sieboldii&quot; and &quot;sieboldiana&quot;. The Hortus Botanicus in Leiden has recently laid out the &quot;Von Siebold Memorial Garden&quot;, a Japanese garden with plants sent by Siebold. The garden was laid out under a 150-year-old &quot;Zelkova serrata&quot; tree dating from Siebold&#x27;s lifetime. Japanese visitors come and visit this garden, to pay their respect for him.

==Siebold museums==
Although he was disillusioned by what he perceived as a lack of appreciation for Japan and his contributions to its understanding, a testimony of the remarkable character of Siebold is found in museums that honor him.
* Japan Museum SieboldHuis in Leiden, Netherlands, shows highlights from the Leiden Siebold collections in the transformed, refitted, formal, first house of Siebold in Leiden
* Naturalis Biodiversity Center, the National Museum of Natural History in Leiden, Netherlands houses the zoological and botanical specimens Siebold collected during his first stay in Japan (1823-1829). These include 200 mammals, 900 birds, 750 fishes, 170 reptiles, over 5,000 invertebrates, 2,000 different species of plants and 12,000 herbarium specimens.
* The National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden, Netherlands houses the large collection which Siebold brought together during his first stay in Japan (1823–1829). 
* The State Museum of Ethnology in Munich, Germany, houses the collection of Philipp Franz von Siebold from his second voyage to Japan (1859–1862) and a letter of Siebold to King Ludwig I in which he urged the monarch to found a museum of ethnology at Munich. Siebold&#x27;s grave, in the shape of a Buddhist pagoda, is in the &quot;&quot; (Former Southern Cemetery of Munich). He is also commemorated in the name of a street and a large number of mentions in the Botanical Garden at Munich.
* A &quot;Siebold-Museum&quot; exists in Würzburg, Germany.
* &quot;Siebold-Museum&quot; on , Schlüchtern, Germany.
* Nagasaki, Japan, pays tribute to Siebold by housing the Siebold Memorial Museum on property adjacent to Siebold&#x27;s former residence in the Narutaki neighborhood, the first museum dedicated to a non-Japanese in Japan.

His collections laid the foundation for the ethnographic museums of Munich and Leiden. Alexander von Siebold, one of his sons by his European wife, donated much of the material left behind after Siebold&#x27;s death in Würzburg to the British Museum in London. The Royal Scientific Academy of St. Petersburg purchased 600 colored plates of the &quot;&quot;.

Another son, Heinrich (or Henry) von Siebold (1852–1908), continued part of his father&#x27;s research. He is recognized, together with Edward S. Morse, as one of the founders of modern archaeological efforts in Japan.

<text>The word probability has been used in a variety of ways since it was first applied to the mathematical study of games of chance. Does probability measure the real, physical, tendency of something to occur, or is it a measure of how strongly one believes it will occur, or does it draw on both these elements? In answering such questions, mathematicians interpret the probability values of probability theory.

There are two broad categories of probability interpretations which can be called &quot;physical&quot; and &quot;evidential&quot; probabilities. Physical probabilities, which are also called objective or frequency probabilities, are associated with random physical systems such as roulette wheels, rolling dice and radioactive atoms. In such systems, a given type of event (such as a yielding a six) tends to occur at a persistent rate, or &quot;relative frequency&quot;, in a long run of trials. Physical probabilities either explain, or are invoked to explain, these stable frequencies. The two main kinds of theory of physical probability are frequentist accounts (such as those of Venn, Reichenbach and von Mises) and propensity accounts (such as those of Popper, Miller, Giere and Fetzer).

Evidential probability, also called Bayesian probability, can be assigned to any statement whatsoever, even when no random process is involved, as a way to represent its subjective plausibility, or the degree to which the statement is supported by the available evidence. On most accounts, evidential probabilities are considered to be degrees of belief, defined in terms of dispositions to gamble at certain odds. The four main evidential interpretations are the classical (e.g. Laplace&#x27;s) interpretation, the subjective interpretation (de Finetti and Savage), the epistemic or inductive interpretation (Ramsey, Cox) and the logical interpretation (Keynes and Carnap). There are also evidential interpretations of probability covering groups, which are often labelled as &#x27;intersubjective&#x27; (proposed by Gillies and Rowbottom).

Some interpretations of probability are associated with approaches to statistical inference, including theories of estimation and hypothesis testing. The physical interpretation, for example, is taken by followers of &quot;frequentist&quot; statistical methods, such as Ronald Fisher, Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson. Statisticians of the opposing Bayesian school typically accept the frequency interpretation when it makes sense (although not as a definition), but there is less agreement regarding physical probabilities. Bayesians consider the calculation of evidential probabilities to be both valid and necessary in statistics. This article, however, focuses on the interpretations of probability rather than theories of statistical inference.

The terminology of this topic is rather confusing, in part because probabilities are studied within a variety of academic fields. The word &quot;frequentist&quot; is especially tricky. To philosophers it refers to a particular theory of physical probability, one that has more or less been abandoned. To scientists, on the other hand, &quot;frequentist probability&quot; is just another name for physical (or objective) probability. Those who promote Bayesian inference view &quot;frequentist statistics&quot; as an approach to statistical inference that is based on the frequency interpretation of probability, usually relying on the law of large numbers and characterized by what is called &#x27;Null Hypothesis Significance Testing&#x27; (NHST). Also the word &quot;objective&quot;, as applied to probability, sometimes means exactly what &quot;physical&quot; means here, but is also used of evidential probabilities that are fixed by rational constraints, such as logical and epistemic probabilities.

==Philosophy==
The philosophy of probability presents problems chiefly in matters of epistemology and the uneasy interface between mathematical concepts and ordinary language as it is used by non-mathematicians.
Probability theory is an established field of study in mathematics. It has its origins in correspondence discussing the mathematics of games of chance between Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat in the seventeenth century, and was formalized and rendered axiomatic as a distinct branch of mathematics by Andrey Kolmogorov in the twentieth century. In axiomatic form, mathematical statements about probability theory carry the same sort of epistemological confidence within the philosophy of mathematics as are shared by other mathematical statements.

The mathematical analysis originated in observations of the behaviour of game equipment such as playing cards and dice, which are designed specifically to introduce random and equalized elements; in mathematical terms, they are subjects of indifference. This is not the only way probabilistic statements are used in ordinary human language: when people say that &quot;it will probably rain&quot;, they typically do not mean that the outcome of rain versus not-rain is a random factor that the odds currently favor; instead, such statements are perhaps better understood as qualifying their expectation of rain with a degree of confidence. Likewise, when it is written that &quot;the most probable explanation&quot; of the name of Ludlow, Massachusetts &quot;is that it was named after Roger Ludlow&quot;, what is meant here is not that Roger Ludlow is favored by a random factor, but rather that this is the most plausible explanation of the evidence, which admits other, less likely explanations.

Thomas Bayes attempted to provide a logic that could handle varying degrees of confidence; as such, Bayesian probability is an attempt to recast the representation of probabilistic statements as an expression of the degree of confidence by which the beliefs they express are held.

Though probability initially had somewhat mundane motivations, its modern influence and use is widespread ranging from evidence-based medicine, through six sigma, all the way to the probabilistically checkable proof and the string theory landscape.

==Classical definition==

The first attempt at mathematical rigour in the field of probability, championed by Pierre-Simon Laplace, is now known as the classical definition. Developed from studies of games of chance (such as rolling dice) it states that probability is shared equally between all the possible outcomes, provided these outcomes can be deemed equally likely. (3.1)


This can be represented mathematically as follows:
If a random experiment can result in &quot;N&quot; mutually exclusive and equally likely outcomes and if &quot;NA&quot; of these outcomes result in the occurrence of the event &quot;A&quot;, the probability of &quot;A&quot; is defined by
:formula_1

There are two clear limitations to the classical definition. Firstly, it is applicable only to situations in which there is only a &#x27;finite&#x27; number of possible outcomes. But some important random experiments, such as tossing a coin until it shows heads, give rise to an infinite set of outcomes. And secondly, it requires an a priori determination that all possible outcomes are equally likely without falling in a trap of circular reasoning by relying on the notion of probability. (In using the terminology &quot;we may be equally undecided&quot;, Laplace assumed, by what has been called the &quot;principle of insufficient reason&quot;, that all possible outcomes are equally likely if there is no known reason to assume otherwise, for which there is no obvious justification.)

==Frequentism==
Frequentists posit that the probability of an event is its relative frequency over time, (3.4) i.e., its relative frequency of occurrence after repeating a process a large number of times under similar conditions. This is also known as aleatory probability. The events are assumed to be governed by some random physical phenomena, which are either phenomena that are predictable, in principle, with sufficient information (see determinism); or phenomena which are essentially unpredictable. Examples of the first kind include tossing dice or spinning a roulette wheel; an example of the second kind is radioactive decay. In the case of tossing a fair coin, frequentists say that the probability of getting a heads is 1/2, not because there are two equally likely outcomes but because repeated series of large numbers of trials demonstrate that the empirical frequency converges to the limit 1/2 as the number of trials goes to infinity.

If we denote by formula_2 the number of occurrences of an event formula_3 in formula_4 trials, then if formula_5 we say that &quot;formula_6&quot;.

The frequentist view has its own problems. It is of course impossible to actually perform an infinity of repetitions of a random experiment to determine the probability of an event. But if only a finite number of repetitions of the process are performed, different relative frequencies will appear in different series of trials. If these relative frequencies are to define the probability, the probability will be slightly different every time it is measured. But the real probability should be the same every time. If we acknowledge the fact that we only can measure a probability with some error of measurement attached, we still get into problems as the error of measurement can only be expressed as a probability, the very concept we are trying to define. This renders even the frequency definition circular; see for example “What is the Chance of an Earthquake?”

==Subjectivism==

Subjectivists, also known as Bayesians or followers of epistemic probability, give the notion of probability a subjective status by regarding it as a measure of the &#x27;degree of belief&#x27; of the individual assessing the uncertainty of a particular situation. Epistemic or subjective probability is sometimes called credence, as opposed to the term chance for a propensity probability. Some examples of epistemic probability are to assign a probability to the proposition that a proposed law of physics is true or to determine how probable it is that a suspect committed a crime, based on the evidence presented. The use of Bayesian probability raises the philosophical debate as to whether it can contribute valid justifications of belief. Bayesians point to the work of Ramsey (p 182) and de Finetti (p 103) as proving that subjective beliefs must follow the laws of probability if they are to be coherent. Evidence casts doubt that humans will have coherent beliefs. The use of Bayesian probability involves specifying a prior probability. This may be obtained from consideration of whether the required prior probability is greater or lesser than a reference probability associated with an urn model or a thought experiment. The issue is that for a given problem, multiple thought experiments could apply, and choosing one is a matter of judgement: different people may assign different prior probabilities, known as the reference class problem. The &quot;sunrise problem&quot; provides an example.

==Propensity==
Propensity theorists think of probability as a physical propensity, or disposition, or tendency of a given type of physical situation to yield an outcome of a certain kind or to yield a long run relative frequency of such an outcome. This kind of objective probability is sometimes called &#x27;chance&#x27;.

Propensities, or chances, are not relative frequencies, but purported causes of the observed stable relative frequencies. Propensities are invoked to explain why repeating a certain kind of experiment will generate given outcome types at persistent rates, which are known as propensities or chances. Frequentists are unable to take this approach, since relative frequencies do not exist for single tosses of a coin, but only for large ensembles or collectives (see &quot;single case possible&quot; in the table above). In contrast, a propensitist is able to use the law of large numbers to explain the behaviour of long-run frequencies. This law, which is a consequence of the axioms of probability, says that if (for example) a coin is tossed repeatedly many times, in such a way that its probability of landing heads is the same on each toss, and the outcomes are probabilistically independent, then the relative frequency of heads will be close to the probability of heads on each single toss. This law allows that stable long-run frequencies are a manifestation of invariant &quot;single-case&quot; probabilities. In addition to explaining the emergence of stable relative frequencies, the idea of propensity is motivated by the desire to make sense of single-case probability attributions in quantum mechanics, such as the probability of decay of a particular atom at a particular time.

The main challenge facing propensity theories is to say exactly what propensity means. (And then, of course, to show that propensity thus defined has the required properties.) At present, unfortunately, none of the well-recognised accounts of propensity comes close to meeting this challenge.

A propensity theory of probability was given by Charles Sanders Peirce. A later propensity theory was proposed by philosopher Karl Popper, who had only slight acquaintance with the writings of C. S. Peirce, however. Popper noted that the outcome of a physical experiment is produced by a certain set of &quot;generating conditions&quot;. When we repeat an experiment, as the saying goes, we really perform another experiment with a (more or less) similar set of generating conditions. To say that a set of generating conditions has propensity &quot;p&quot; of producing the outcome &quot;E&quot; means that those exact conditions, if repeated indefinitely, would produce an outcome sequence in which &quot;E&quot; occurred with limiting relative frequency &quot;p&quot;. For Popper then, a deterministic experiment would have propensity 0 or 1 for each outcome, since those generating conditions would have same outcome on each trial. In other words, non-trivial propensities (those that differ from 0 and 1) only exist for genuinely nondeterministic experiments.

A number of other philosophers, including David Miller and Donald A. Gillies, have proposed propensity theories somewhat similar to Popper&#x27;s.

Other propensity theorists (e.g. Ronald Giere) do not explicitly define propensities at all, but rather see propensity as defined by the theoretical role it plays in science. They argued, for example, that physical magnitudes such as electrical charge cannot be explicitly defined either, in terms of more basic things, but only in terms of what they do (such as attracting and repelling other electrical charges). In a similar way, propensity is whatever fills the various roles that physical probability plays in science.

What roles does physical probability play in science? What are its properties? One central property of chance is that, when known, it constrains rational belief to take the same numerical value. David Lewis called this the &quot;Principal Principle&quot;, (3.3 &amp; 3.5) a term that philosophers have mostly adopted. For example, suppose you are certain that a particular biased coin has propensity 0.32 to land heads every time it is tossed. What is then the correct price for a gamble that pays $1 if the coin lands heads, and nothing otherwise? According to the Principal Principle, the fair price is 32 cents.

==Logical, epistemic, and inductive probability==
It is widely recognized that the term &quot;probability&quot; is sometimes used in contexts where it has nothing to do with physical randomness. Consider, for example, the claim that the extinction of the dinosaurs was probably caused by a large meteorite hitting the earth. Statements such as &quot;Hypothesis H is probably true&quot; have been interpreted to mean that the (presently available) empirical evidence (E, say) supports H to a high degree. This degree of support of H by E has been called the logical, or epistemic, or inductive probability of H given E.

The differences between these interpretations are rather small, and may seem inconsequential. One of the main points of disagreement lies in the relation between probability and belief. Logical probabilities are conceived (for example in Keynes&#x27; Treatise on Probability) to be objective, logical relations between propositions (or sentences), and hence not to depend in any way upon belief. They are degrees of (partial) entailment, or degrees of logical consequence, not degrees of belief. (They do, nevertheless, dictate proper degrees of belief, as is discussed below.) Frank P. Ramsey, on the other hand, was skeptical about the existence of such objective logical relations and argued that (evidential) probability is &quot;the logic of partial belief&quot;. (p 157) In other words, Ramsey held that epistemic probabilities simply &quot;are&quot; degrees of rational belief, rather than being logical relations that merely &quot;constrain&quot; degrees of rational belief.

Another point of disagreement concerns the &quot;uniqueness&quot; of evidential probability, relative to a given state of knowledge. Rudolf Carnap held, for example, that logical principles always determine a unique logical probability for any statement, relative to any body of evidence. Ramsey, by contrast, thought that while degrees of belief are subject to some rational constraints (such as, but not limited to, the axioms of probability) these constraints usually do not determine a unique value. Rational people, in other words, may differ somewhat in their degrees of belief, even if they all have the same information.

==Prediction==

An alternative account of probability emphasizes the role of &quot;prediction&quot; – predicting future observations on the basis of past observations, not on unobservable parameters. In its modern form, it is mainly in the Bayesian vein. This was the main function of probability before the 20th century, but fell out of favor compared to the parametric approach, which modeled phenomena as a physical system that was observed with error, such as in celestial mechanics.

The modern predictive approach was pioneered by Bruno de Finetti, with the central idea of exchangeability – that future observations should behave like past observations. This view came to the attention of the Anglophone world with the 1974 translation of de Finetti&#x27;s book, and has
since been propounded by such statisticians as Seymour Geisser.

==Axiomatic probability==
The mathematics of probability can be developed on an entirely axiomatic basis that is independent of any interpretation: see the articles on probability theory and probability axioms for a detailed treatment.

<text>The standard probability axioms are the foundations of probability theory introduced by Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov in 1933. These axioms remain central and have direct contributions to mathematics, the physical sciences, and real-world probability cases.

There are several other (equivalent) approaches to formalising probability. Bayesians will often motivate the Kolmogorov axioms by invoking Cox&#x27;s theorem or the Dutch book arguments instead.

== Kolmogorov axioms ==
The assumptions as to setting up the axioms can be summarised as follows: Let formula_1 be a measure space with formula_2 being the probability of some event formula_3, and formula_4. Then formula_1 is a probability space, with sample space formula_6, event space formula_7 and probability measure formula_8.

===First axiom ===
The probability of an event is a non-negative real number:
:formula_9

where formula_7 is the event space. It follows (when combined with the second axiom) that formula_2 is always finite, in contrast with more general measure theory. Theories which assign negative probability relax the first axiom.

=== Second axiom ===
This is the assumption of unit measure: that the probability that at least one of the elementary events in the entire sample space will occur is 1.

: formula_4

=== Third axiom ===
This is the assumption of σ-additivity:
: Any countable sequence of disjoint sets (synonymous with &quot;mutually exclusive&quot; events) formula_13 satisfies
::formula_14
Some authors consider merely finitely additive probability spaces, in which case one just needs an algebra of sets, rather than a σ-algebra. Quasiprobability distributions in general relax the third axiom.

== Consequences ==
From the Kolmogorov axioms, one can deduce other useful rules for studying probabilities. The proofs of these rules are a very insightful procedure that illustrates the power of the third axiom, and its interaction with the prior two axioms. Four of the immediate corollaries and their proofs are shown below:

=== Monotonicity ===

:formula_15

If A is a subset of, or equal to B, then the probability of A is less than, or equal to the probability of B.

==== &quot;Proof of monotonicity&quot; ====
In order to verify the monotonicity property, we set formula_16 and formula_17, where formula_18 and formula_19 for formula_20. From the properties of the empty set (formula_21), it is easy to see that the sets formula_22 are pairwise disjoint and formula_23. Hence, we obtain from the third axiom that

:formula_24

Since, by the first axiom, the left-hand side of this equation is a series of non-negative numbers, and since it converges to formula_25 which is finite, we obtain both formula_26 and formula_27.

=== The probability of the empty set ===

: formula_28

In many cases, formula_21 is not the only event with probability 0.

==== &quot;Proof of the probability of the empty set&quot;====

formula_30 since formula_31,

formula_32 by applying the third axiom to the left-hand side 
(note formula_21 is disjoint with itself), and so

formula_34 by subtracting formula_35 from each side of the equation.

=== The complement rule ===
formula_36

==== &quot;Proof of the complement rule&quot; ====
Given formula_37 and formula_38 are mutually exclusive and that formula_39:

formula_40 &quot;... (by axiom 3)&quot;

and, formula_41 ... &quot;(by axiom 2)&quot;

formula_42

formula_43

=== The numeric bound ===
It immediately follows from the monotonicity property that
: formula_44

==== &quot;Proof of the numeric bound&quot; ====
Given the complement rule formula_45 and &quot;axiom 1&quot; formula_46:

formula_47

formula_48

formula_49

== Further consequences ==
Another important property is:

: formula_50

This is called the addition law of probability, or the sum rule.
That is, the probability that an event in &quot;A&quot; &quot;or&quot; &quot;B&quot; will happen is the sum of the probability of an event in &quot;A&quot; and the probability of an event in &quot;B&quot;, minus the probability of an event that is in both &quot;A&quot; &quot;and&quot; &quot;B&quot;. The proof of this is as follows:

Firstly,

:formula_51. &quot;(by Axiom 3)&quot;

So,

:formula_52 (by formula_53).

Also,

:formula_54

and eliminating formula_55 from both equations gives us the desired result.

An extension of the addition law to any number of sets is the inclusion–exclusion principle.

Setting &quot;B&quot; to the complement &quot;Ac&quot; of &quot;A&quot; in the addition law gives

: formula_56

That is, the probability that any event will &quot;not&quot; happen (or the event&#x27;s complement) is 1 minus the probability that it will.

== Simple example: coin toss ==
Consider a single coin-toss, and assume that the coin will either land heads (H) or tails (T) (but not both). No assumption is made as to whether the coin is fair or as to whether or not any bias depends on how the coin is tossed.

We may define:

: formula_57
: formula_58

Kolmogorov&#x27;s axioms imply that:

: formula_34
The probability of &quot;neither&quot; heads &quot;nor&quot; tails, is 0.

: formula_60
The probability of &quot;either&quot; heads &quot;or&quot; tails, is 1.

: formula_61
The sum of the probability of heads and the probability of tails, is 1.

<text>Probability theory or probability calculus is the branch of mathematics concerned with probability. Although there are several different probability interpretations, probability theory treats the concept in a rigorous mathematical manner by expressing it through a set of axioms. Typically these axioms formalise probability in terms of a probability space, which assigns a measure taking values between 0 and 1, termed the probability measure, to a set of outcomes called the sample space. Any specified subset of the sample space is called an event.

Central subjects in probability theory include discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions, and stochastic processes (which provide mathematical abstractions of non-deterministic or uncertain processes or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or evolve over time in a random fashion).
Although it is not possible to perfectly predict random events, much can be said about their behavior. Two major results in probability theory describing such behaviour are the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.

As a mathematical foundation for statistics, probability theory is essential to many human activities that involve quantitative analysis of data. Methods of probability theory also apply to descriptions of complex systems given only partial knowledge of their state, as in statistical mechanics or sequential estimation. A great discovery of twentieth-century physics was the probabilistic nature of physical phenomena at atomic scales, described in quantum mechanics. 

==History of probability==
The modern mathematical theory of probability has its roots in attempts to analyze games of chance by Gerolamo Cardano in the sixteenth century, and by Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal in the seventeenth century (for example the &quot;problem of points&quot;). Christiaan Huygens published a book on the subject in 1657. In the 19th century, what is considered the classical definition of probability was completed by Pierre Laplace.

Initially, probability theory mainly considered events, and its methods were mainly combinatorial. Eventually, analytical considerations compelled the incorporation of variables into the theory.

This culminated in modern probability theory, on foundations laid by Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov. Kolmogorov combined the notion of sample space, introduced by Richard von Mises, and measure theory and presented his axiom system for probability theory in 1933. This became the mostly undisputed axiomatic basis for modern probability theory; but, alternatives exist, such as the adoption of finite rather than countable additivity by Bruno de Finetti.

==Treatment==
Most introductions to probability theory treat discrete probability distributions and continuous probability distributions separately. The measure theory-based treatment of probability covers the discrete, continuous, a mix of the two, and more.

===Motivation===
Consider an experiment that can produce a number of outcomes. The set of all outcomes is called the &quot;sample space&quot; of the experiment. The &quot;power set&quot; of the sample space (or equivalently, the event space) is formed by considering all different collections of possible results. For example, rolling an honest die produces one of six possible results. One collection of possible results corresponds to getting an odd number. Thus, the subset {1,3,5} is an element of the power set of the sample space of dice rolls. These collections are called &quot;events&quot;. In this case, {1,3,5} is the event that the die falls on some odd number. If the results that actually occur fall in a given event, that event is said to have occurred.

Probability is a way of assigning every &quot;event&quot; a value between zero and one, with the requirement that the event made up of all possible results (in our example, the event {1,2,3,4,5,6}) be assigned a value of one. To qualify as a probability distribution, the assignment of values must satisfy the requirement that if you look at a collection of mutually exclusive events (events that contain no common results, e.g., the events {1,6}, {3}, and {2,4} are all mutually exclusive), the probability that any of these events occurs is given by the sum of the probabilities of the events.

The probability that any one of the events {1,6}, {3}, or {2,4} will occur is 5/6. This is the same as saying that the probability of event {1,2,3,4,6} is 5/6. This event encompasses the possibility of any number except five being rolled. The mutually exclusive event {5} has a probability of 1/6, and the event {1,2,3,4,5,6} has a probability of 1, that is, absolute certainty.

When doing calculations using the outcomes of an experiment, it is necessary that all those elementary events have a number assigned to them. This is done using a random variable. A random variable is a function that assigns to each elementary event in the sample space a real number. This function is usually denoted by a capital letter. In the case of a die, the assignment of a number to certain elementary events can be done using the identity function. This does not always work. For example, when flipping a coin the two possible outcomes are &quot;heads&quot; and &quot;tails&quot;. In this example, the random variable &quot;X&quot; could assign to the outcome &quot;heads&quot; the number &quot;0&quot; (formula_1) and to the outcome &quot;tails&quot; the number &quot;1&quot; (formula_2).

===Discrete probability distributions===


 deals with events that occur in countable sample spaces.

Examples: Throwing dice, experiments with decks of cards, random walk, and tossing coins.
Initially the probability of an event to occur was defined as the number of cases favorable for the event, over the number of total outcomes possible in an equiprobable sample space: see Classical definition of probability.

For example, if the event is &quot;occurrence of an even number when a dice is rolled&quot;, the probability is given by formula_3, since 3 faces out of the 6 have even numbers and each face has the same probability of appearing.
The modern definition starts with a finite or countable set called the sample space, which relates to the set of all &quot;possible outcomes&quot; in classical sense, denoted by formula_4. It is then assumed that for each element formula_5, an intrinsic &quot;probability&quot; value formula_6 is attached, which satisfies the following properties:
# formula_7
# formula_8

That is, the probability function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) lies between zero and one for every value of &quot;x&quot; in the sample space &quot;Ω&quot;, and the sum of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) over all values &quot;x&quot; in the sample space &quot;Ω&quot; is equal to 1. An is defined as any subset formula_9 of the sample space formula_10. The of the event formula_9 is defined as
:formula_12

So, the probability of the entire sample space is 1, and the probability of the null event is 0.

The function formula_6 mapping a point in the sample space to the &quot;probability&quot; value is called a abbreviated as . 

===Continuous probability distributions===


 deals with events that occur in a continuous sample space.
The classical definition breaks down when confronted with the continuous case. See Bertrand&#x27;s paradox.
If the sample space of a random variable &quot;X&quot; is the set of real numbers (formula_14) or a subset thereof, then a function called the () formula_15 exists, defined by formula_16. That is, &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) returns the probability that &quot;X&quot; will be less than or equal to &quot;x&quot;.

The CDF necessarily satisfies the following properties.
# formula_15 is a monotonically non-decreasing, right-continuous function;
# formula_18
# formula_19

The random variable formula_20 is said to have a continuous probability distribution if the corresponding CDF formula_21 is continuous. If formula_15 is absolutely continuous, then its derivative exists almost everywhere and integrating the derivative gives us the CDF back again. In this case, the random variable &quot;X&quot; is said to have a () or simply formula_23

For a set formula_24, the probability of the random variable &quot;X&quot; being in formula_9 is
:formula_26

In case the PDF exists, this can be written as
:formula_27

Whereas the &quot;PDF&quot; exists only for continuous random variables, the &quot;CDF&quot; exists for all random variables (including discrete random variables) that take values in formula_28

These concepts can be generalized for multidimensional cases on formula_29 and other continuous sample spaces.

===Measure-theoretic probability theory===
The utility of the measure-theoretic treatment of probability is that it unifies the discrete and the continuous cases, and makes the difference a question of which measure is used. Furthermore, it covers distributions that are neither discrete nor continuous nor mixtures of the two.

An example of such distributions could be a mix of discrete and continuous distributions—for example, a random variable that is 0 with probability 1/2, and takes a random value from a normal distribution with probability 1/2. It can still be studied to some extent by considering it to have a PDF of formula_30, where formula_31 is the Dirac delta function.

Other distributions may not even be a mix, for example, the Cantor distribution has no positive probability for any single point, neither does it have a density. The modern approach to probability theory solves these problems using measure theory to define the probability space:

Given any set formula_10 (also called ) and a σ-algebra formula_33 on it, a measure formula_34 defined on formula_33 is called a if formula_36

If formula_33 is the Borel σ-algebra on the set of real numbers, then there is a unique probability measure on formula_33 for any CDF, and vice versa. The measure corresponding to a CDF is said to be by the CDF. This measure coincides with the pmf for discrete variables and PDF for continuous variables, making the measure-theoretic approach free of fallacies.

The &quot;probability&quot; of a set formula_9 in the σ-algebra formula_33 is defined as

:formula_41
where the integration is with respect to the measure formula_42 induced by formula_43

Along with providing better understanding and unification of discrete and continuous probabilities, measure-theoretic treatment also allows us to work on probabilities outside formula_29, as in the theory of stochastic processes. For example, to study Brownian motion, probability is defined on a space of functions.

When it is convenient to work with a dominating measure, the Radon-Nikodym theorem is used to define a density as the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the probability distribution of interest with respect to this dominating measure. Discrete densities are usually defined as this derivative with respect to a counting measure over the set of all possible outcomes. Densities for absolutely continuous distributions are usually defined as this derivative with respect to the Lebesgue measure. If a theorem can be proved in this general setting, it holds for both discrete and continuous distributions as well as others; separate proofs are not required for discrete and continuous distributions.

==Classical probability distributions==
Certain random variables occur very often in probability theory because they well describe many natural or physical processes. Their distributions, therefore, have gained &quot;special importance&quot; in probability theory. Some fundamental &quot;discrete distributions&quot; are the discrete uniform, Bernoulli, binomial, negative binomial, Poisson and geometric distributions. Important &quot;continuous distributions&quot; include the continuous uniform, normal, exponential, gamma and beta distributions.

==Convergence of random variables==

In probability theory, there are several notions of convergence for random variables. They are listed below in the order of strength, i.e., any subsequent notion of convergence in the list implies convergence according to all of the preceding notions.

;Weak convergence: A sequence of random variables formula_45 converges to the random variable formula_46 if their respective CDF convergesformula_47 converges to the CDF formula_15 of formula_46, wherever formula_15 is continuous. Weak convergence is also called .

:Most common shorthand notation: formula_51

;Convergence in probability: The sequence of random variables formula_52 is said to converge towards the random variable formula_46 if formula_54 for every ε &gt; 0.

:Most common shorthand notation: formula_55

;Strong convergence: The sequence of random variables formula_52 is said to converge towards the random variable formula_46 if formula_58. Strong convergence is also known as .

:Most common shorthand notation: formula_59

As the names indicate, weak convergence is weaker than strong convergence. In fact, strong convergence implies convergence in probability, and convergence in probability implies weak convergence. The reverse statements are not always true.

===Law of large numbers===

Common intuition suggests that if a fair coin is tossed many times, then &quot;roughly&quot; half of the time it will turn up &quot;heads&quot;, and the other half it will turn up &quot;tails&quot;. Furthermore, the more often the coin is tossed, the more likely it should be that the ratio of the number of &quot;heads&quot; to the number of &quot;tails&quot; will approach unity. Modern probability theory provides a formal version of this intuitive idea, known as the . This law is remarkable because it is not assumed in the foundations of probability theory, but instead emerges from these foundations as a theorem. Since it links theoretically derived probabilities to their actual frequency of occurrence in the real world, the law of large numbers is considered as a pillar in the history of statistical theory and has had widespread influence.
The (LLN) states that the sample average
:formula_60
of a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables formula_61 converges towards their common expectation (expected value) formula_62, provided that the expectation of formula_63 is finite.

It is in the different forms of convergence of random variables that separates the &quot;weak&quot; and the &quot;strong&quot; law of large numbers

:Weak law: formula_64 for formula_65

:Strong law: formula_66 for formula_67

It follows from the LLN that if an event of probability &quot;p&quot; is observed repeatedly during independent experiments, the ratio of the observed frequency of that event to the total number of repetitions converges towards &quot;p&quot;.

For example, if formula_68 are independent Bernoulli random variables taking values 1 with probability &quot;p&quot; and 0 with probability 1-&quot;p&quot;, then formula_69 for all &quot;i&quot;, so that formula_70 converges to &quot;p&quot; almost surely.

===Central limit theorem===

The central limit theorem (CLT) explains the ubiquitous occurrence of the normal distribution in nature, and this theorem, according to David Williams, &quot;is one of the great results of mathematics.&quot;

The theorem states that the average of many independent and identically distributed random variables with finite variance tends towards a normal distribution &quot;irrespective&quot; of the distribution followed by the original random variables. Formally, let formula_52 be independent random variables with mean formula_62 and variance formula_73 Then the sequence of random variables
:formula_74
converges in distribution to a standard normal random variable.

For some classes of random variables, the classic central limit theorem works rather fast, as illustrated in the Berry–Esseen theorem. For example, the distributions with finite first, second, and third moment from the exponential family; on the other hand, for some random variables of the heavy tail and fat tail variety, it works very slowly or may not work at all: in such cases one may use the Generalized Central Limit Theorem (GCLT).

<text>In probability theory and statistics, a probability distribution is the mathematical function that gives the probabilities of occurrence of possible outcomes for an experiment. It is a mathematical description of a random phenomenon in terms of its sample space and the probabilities of events (subsets of the sample space).

For instance, if is used to denote the outcome of a coin toss (&quot;the experiment&quot;), then the probability distribution of would take the value 0.5 (1 in 2 or 1/2) for , and 0.5 for (assuming that the coin is fair). More commonly, probability distributions are used to compare the relative occurrence of many different random values.

Probability distributions can be defined in different ways and for discrete or for continuous variables. Distributions with special properties or for especially important applications are given specific names.

==Introduction==
A probability distribution is a mathematical description of the probabilities of events, subsets of the sample space. The sample space, often represented in notation by formula_1 is the set of all possible outcomes of a random phenomenon being observed. The sample space may be any set: a set of real numbers, a set of descriptive labels, a set of vectors, a set of arbitrary non-numerical values, etc. For example, the sample space of a coin flip could be 

To define probability distributions for the specific case of random variables (so the sample space can be seen as a numeric set), it is common to distinguish between discrete and absolutely continuous random variables. In the discrete case, it is sufficient to specify a probability mass function formula_2 assigning a probability to each possible outcome (e.g. when throwing a fair die, each of the six digits to , corresponding to the number of dots on the die, has the probability formula_3 The probability of an event is then defined to be the sum of the probabilities of all outcomes that satisfy the event; for example, the probability of the event &quot;the die rolls an even value&quot; is 
formula_4

In contrast, when a random variable takes values from a continuum then by convention, any individual outcome is assigned probability zero. For such continuous random variables, only events that include infinitely many outcomes such as intervals have probability greater than 0.

For example, consider measuring the weight of a piece of ham in the supermarket, and assume the scale can provide arbitrarily many digits of precision. Then, the probability that it weighs &quot;exactly&quot; 500g must be zero because no matter how high the level of precision chosen, it cannot be assumed that there are no non-zero decimal digits in the remaining omitted digits ignored by the precision level.

However, for the same use case, it is possible to meet quality control requirements such as that a package of &quot;500 g&quot; of ham must weigh between 490 g and 510 g with at least 98% probability. This is possible because this measurement does not require as much precision from the underlying equipment.
Absolutely continuous probability distributions can be described in several ways. The probability density function describes the infinitesimal probability of any given value, and the probability that the outcome lies in a given interval can be computed by integrating the probability density function over that interval. An alternative description of the distribution is by means of the cumulative distribution function, which describes the probability that the random variable is no larger than a given value (i.e., formula_5 for some The cumulative distribution function is the area under the probability density function from formula_6 to formula_7 as shown in figure 1.

==General probability definition==

Let formula_8 be a probability space, formula_9 be a measurable space, and formula_10 be a formula_9-valued random variable. Then the probability distribution of formula_12 is the pushforward measure of the probability measure formula_13 onto formula_9 induced by formula_12. Explicitly, this pushforward measure on formula_9 is given by
:formula_17 for formula_18

Any probability distribution is a probability measure on formula_9 (in general different from formula_13, unless formula_12 happens to be the identity map).

A probability distribution can be described in various forms, such as by a probability mass function or a cumulative distribution function. One of the most general descriptions, which applies for absolutely continuous and discrete variables, is by means of a probability function formula_22 whose input space formula_23 is a σ-algebra, and gives a real number probability as its output, particularly, a number in formula_24.

The probability function formula_13 can take as argument subsets of the sample space itself, as in the coin toss example, where the function formula_13 was defined so that and . However, because of the widespread use of random variables, which transform the sample space into a set of numbers (e.g., formula_27, formula_28), it is more common to study probability distributions whose argument are subsets of these particular kinds of sets (number sets), and all probability distributions discussed in this article are of this type. It is common to denote as formula_29 the probability that a certain value of the variable formula_12 belongs to a certain event formula_31.

The above probability function only characterizes a probability distribution if it satisfies all the Kolmogorov axioms, that is:
# formula_32, so the probability is non-negative
# formula_33, so no probability exceeds formula_34
# formula_35 for any countable disjoint family of sets formula_36

The concept of probability function is made more rigorous by defining it as the element of a probability space formula_37, where formula_12 is the set of possible outcomes, formula_23 is the set of all subsets formula_40 whose probability can be measured, and formula_13 is the probability function, or probability measure, that assigns a probability to each of these measurable subsets formula_42.

Probability distributions usually belong to one of two classes. A discrete probability distribution is applicable to the scenarios where the set of possible outcomes is discrete (e.g. a coin toss, a roll of a die) and the probabilities are encoded by a discrete list of the probabilities of the outcomes; in this case the discrete probability distribution is known as probability mass function. On the other hand, absolutely continuous probability distributions are applicable to scenarios where the set of possible outcomes can take on values in a continuous range (e.g. real numbers), such as the temperature on a given day. In the absolutely continuous case, probabilities are described by a probability density function, and the probability distribution is by definition the integral of the probability density function. The normal distribution is a commonly encountered absolutely continuous probability distribution. More complex experiments, such as those involving stochastic processes defined in continuous time, may demand the use of more general probability measures.

A probability distribution whose sample space is one-dimensional (for example real numbers, list of labels, ordered labels or binary) is called univariate, while a distribution whose sample space is a vector space of dimension 2 or more is called multivariate. A univariate distribution gives the probabilities of a single random variable taking on various different values; a multivariate distribution (a joint probability distribution) gives the probabilities of a random vector – a list of two or more random variables – taking on various combinations of values. Important and commonly encountered univariate probability distributions include the binomial distribution, the hypergeometric distribution, and the normal distribution. A commonly encountered multivariate distribution is the multivariate normal distribution.

Besides the probability function, the cumulative distribution function, the probability mass function and the probability density function, the moment generating function and the characteristic function also serve to identify a probability distribution, as they uniquely determine an underlying cumulative distribution function.
== Terminology ==

Some key concepts and terms, widely used in the literature on the topic of probability distributions, are listed below.

=== Basic terms ===
*&quot;Random variable&quot;: takes values from a sample space; probabilities describe which values and set of values are taken more likely.
*&quot;Event&quot;: set of possible values (outcomes) of a random variable that occurs with a certain probability.
*&quot;Probability function&quot; or &quot;probability measure&quot;: describes the probability formula_29 that the event formula_44 occurs.
*&quot;Cumulative distribution function&quot;: function evaluating the probability that formula_12 will take a value less than or equal to formula_46 for a random variable (only for real-valued random variables).
*&quot;Quantile function&quot;: the inverse of the cumulative distribution function. Gives formula_46 such that, with probability formula_48, formula_12 will not exceed formula_46.

==Cumulative distribution function==
In the special case of a real-valued random variable, the probability distribution can equivalently be represented by a cumulative distribution function instead of a probability measure. The cumulative distribution function of a random variable formula_12 with regard to a probability distribution formula_59 is defined as
formula_60

The cumulative distribution function of any real-valued random variable has the properties:
*
*

Conversely, any function formula_61 that satisfies the first four of the properties above is the cumulative distribution function of some probability distribution on the real numbers.

Any probability distribution can be decomposed as the mixture of a discrete, an absolutely continuous and a singular continuous distribution, and thus any cumulative distribution function admits a decomposition as the convex sum of the three according cumulative distribution functions.

==Discrete probability distribution==


A discrete probability distribution is the probability distribution of a random variable that can take on only a countable number of values (almost surely) which means that the probability of any event formula_31 can be expressed as a (finite or countably infinite) sum:
formula_63
where formula_64 is a countable set with formula_65. Thus the discrete random variables (i.e. random variables whose probability distribution is discrete) are exactly those with a probability mass function formula_66. In the case where the range of values is countably infinite, these values have to decline to zero fast enough for the probabilities to add up to 1. For example, if formula_67 for formula_68, the sum of probabilities would be formula_69.

Well-known discrete probability distributions used in statistical modeling include the Poisson distribution, the Bernoulli distribution, the binomial distribution, the geometric distribution, the negative binomial distribution and categorical distribution. When a sample (a set of observations) is drawn from a larger population, the sample points have an empirical distribution that is discrete, and which provides information about the population distribution. Additionally, the discrete uniform distribution is commonly used in computer programs that make equal-probability random selections between a number of choices.

===Cumulative distribution function===
A real-valued discrete random variable can equivalently be defined as a random variable whose cumulative distribution function increases only by jump discontinuities—that is, its cdf increases only where it &quot;jumps&quot; to a higher value, and is constant in intervals without jumps. The points where jumps occur are precisely the values which the random variable may take.
Thus the cumulative distribution function has the form
formula_70

The points where the cdf jumps always form a countable set; this may be any countable set and thus may even be dense in the real numbers.

===Dirac delta representation===
A discrete probability distribution is often represented with Dirac measures, the probability distributions of deterministic random variables. For any outcome formula_71, let formula_72 be the Dirac measure concentrated at formula_71. Given a discrete probability distribution, there is a countable set formula_64 with formula_65 and a probability mass function formula_59. If formula_31 is any event, then
formula_78 or in short, formula_79

Similarly, discrete distributions can be represented with the Dirac delta function as a generalized probability density function formula_80, where formula_81 which means
formula_82 for any event formula_83

===Indicator-function representation===
For a discrete random variable formula_12, let formula_85 be the values it can take with non-zero probability. Denote

formula_86

These are disjoint sets, and for such sets

formula_87

It follows that the probability that formula_12 takes any value except for formula_85 is zero, and thus one can write formula_12 as

formula_91

except on a set of probability zero, where formula_92 is the indicator function of formula_64. This may serve as an alternative definition of discrete random variables.

===One-point distribution===
A special case is the discrete distribution of a random variable that can take on only one fixed value; in other words, it is a deterministic distribution. Expressed formally, the random variable formula_12 has a one-point distribution if it has a possible outcome formula_46 such that formula_96 All other possible outcomes then have probability 0. Its cumulative distribution function jumps immediately from 0 to 1.

== Absolutely continuous probability distribution==
An absolutely continuous probability distribution is a probability distribution on the real numbers with uncountably many possible values, such as a whole interval in the real line, and where the probability of any event can be expressed as an integral. More precisely, a real random variable formula_12 has an absolutely continuous probability distribution if there is a function formula_98 such that for each interval formula_99 the probability of formula_12 belonging to formula_101 is given by the integral of formula_80 over formula_101:
formula_104
This is the definition of a probability density function, so that absolutely continuous probability distributions are exactly those with a probability density function.
In particular, the probability for formula_12 to take any single value formula_106 (that is, formula_107) is zero, because an integral with coinciding upper and lower limits is always equal to zero.
If the interval formula_108 is replaced by any measurable set formula_64, the according equality still holds:
formula_110

An absolutely continuous random variable is a random variable whose probability distribution is absolutely continuous.

There are many examples of absolutely continuous probability distributions: normal, uniform, chi-squared, and others.

=== Cumulative distribution function ===
Absolutely continuous probability distributions as defined above are precisely those with an absolutely continuous cumulative distribution function.
In this case, the cumulative distribution function formula_111 has the form
formula_112
where formula_80 is a density of the random variable formula_12 with regard to the distribution formula_13.

&quot;Note on terminology:&quot; Absolutely continuous distributions ought to be distinguished from continuous distributions, which are those having a continuous cumulative distribution function. Every absolutely continuous distribution is a continuous distribution but the inverse is not true, there exist singular distributions, which are neither absolutely continuous nor discrete nor a mixture of those, and do not have a density. An example is given by the Cantor distribution. Some authors however use the term &quot;continuous distribution&quot; to denote all distributions whose cumulative distribution function is absolutely continuous, i.e. refer to absolutely continuous distributions as continuous distributions. 

For a more general definition of density functions and the equivalent absolutely continuous measures see absolutely continuous measure.

== Kolmogorov definition ==
In the measure-theoretic formalization of probability theory, a random variable is defined as a measurable function formula_12 from a probability space formula_117 to a measurable space formula_118. Given that probabilities of events of the form formula_119 satisfy Kolmogorov&#x27;s probability axioms, the probability distribution of formula_12 is the image measure formula_121 of formula_12 , which is a probability measure on formula_118 satisfying formula_124.

==Other kinds of distributions==

Absolutely continuous and discrete distributions with support on formula_125 or formula_126 are extremely useful to model a myriad of phenomena, since most practical distributions are supported on relatively simple subsets, such as hypercubes or balls. However, this is not always the case, and there exist phenomena with supports that are actually complicated curves formula_127 within some space formula_128 or similar. In these cases, the probability distribution is supported on the image of such curve, and is likely to be determined empirically, rather than finding a closed formula for it.

One example is shown in the figure to the right, which displays the evolution of a system of differential equations (commonly known as the Rabinovich–Fabrikant equations) that can be used to model the behaviour of Langmuir waves in plasma. When this phenomenon is studied, the observed states from the subset are as indicated in red. So one could ask what is the probability of observing a state in a certain position of the red subset; if such a probability exists, it is called the probability measure of the system.

This kind of complicated support appears quite frequently in dynamical systems. It is not simple to establish that the system has a probability measure, and the main problem is the following. Let formula_129 be instants in time and formula_130 a subset of the support; if the probability measure exists for the system, one would expect the frequency of observing states inside set formula_130 would be equal in interval formula_132 and formula_133, which might not happen; for example, it could oscillate similar to a sine, formula_134, whose limit when formula_135 does not converge. Formally, the measure exists only if the limit of the relative frequency converges when the system is observed into the infinite future. The branch of dynamical systems that studies the existence of a probability measure is ergodic theory.

Note that even in these cases, the probability distribution, if it exists, might still be termed &quot;absolutely continuous&quot; or &quot;discrete&quot; depending on whether the support is uncountable or countable, respectively.

==Random number generation==
Most algorithms are based on a pseudorandom number generator that produces numbers formula_12 that are uniformly distributed in the half-open interval . These random variates formula_12 are then transformed via some algorithm to create a new random variate having the required probability distribution. With this source of uniform pseudo-randomness, realizations of any random variable can be generated.

For example, suppose formula_138 has a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. To construct a random Bernoulli variable for some formula_139, we define
&lt;math display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;X = \begin{cases}
1,&amp; \text{if } U
so that
&lt;math display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;\Pr(X=1) = \Pr(U

This random variable &quot;X&quot; has a Bernoulli distribution with parameter formula_59. This is a transformation of discrete random variable.

For a distribution function formula_111 of an absolutely continuous random variable, an absolutely continuous random variable must be constructed. formula_142, an inverse function of formula_111, relates to the uniform variable formula_138:
formula_145

For example, suppose a random variable that has an exponential distribution formula_146 must be constructed.

formula_147
so formula_148 and if formula_138 has a formula_150 distribution, then the random variable formula_12 is defined by formula_152. This has an exponential distribution of formula_153.

A frequent problem in statistical simulations (the Monte Carlo method) is the generation of pseudo-random numbers that are distributed in a given way.

== Common probability distributions and their applications ==
The concept of the probability distribution and the random variables which they describe underlies the mathematical discipline of probability theory, and the science of statistics. There is spread or variability in almost any value that can be measured in a population (e.g. height of people, durability of a metal, sales growth, traffic flow, etc.); almost all measurements are made with some intrinsic error; in physics, many processes are described probabilistically, from the kinetic properties of gases to the quantum mechanical description of fundamental particles. For these and many other reasons, simple numbers are often inadequate for describing a quantity, while probability distributions are often more appropriate.

The following is a list of some of the most common probability distributions, grouped by the type of process that they are related to. For a more complete list, see list of probability distributions, which groups by the nature of the outcome being considered (discrete, absolutely continuous, multivariate, etc.)

All of the univariate distributions below are singly peaked; that is, it is assumed that the values cluster around a single point. In practice, actually observed quantities may cluster around multiple values. Such quantities can be modeled using a mixture distribution.

=== Linear growth (e.g. errors, offsets) ===

* Normal distribution (Gaussian distribution), for a single such quantity; the most commonly used absolutely continuous distribution

=== Exponential growth (e.g. prices, incomes, populations) ===

* Log-normal distribution, for a single such quantity whose log is normally distributed
* Pareto distribution, for a single such quantity whose log is exponentially distributed; the prototypical power law distribution

=== Uniformly distributed quantities ===

* Discrete uniform distribution, for a finite set of values (e.g. the outcome of a fair dice)
* Continuous uniform distribution, for absolutely continuously distributed values

=== Bernoulli trials (yes/no events, with a given probability) ===

* Basic distributions:
** Bernoulli distribution, for the outcome of a single Bernoulli trial (e.g. success/failure, yes/no)
** Binomial distribution, for the number of &quot;positive occurrences&quot; (e.g. successes, yes votes, etc.) given a fixed total number of independent occurrences
** Negative binomial distribution, for binomial-type observations but where the quantity of interest is the number of failures before a given number of successes occurs
** Geometric distribution, for binomial-type observations but where the quantity of interest is the number of failures before the first success; a special case of the negative binomial distribution
* Related to sampling schemes over a finite population:
** Hypergeometric distribution, for the number of &quot;positive occurrences&quot; (e.g. successes, yes votes, etc.) given a fixed number of total occurrences, using sampling without replacement
** Beta-binomial distribution, for the number of &quot;positive occurrences&quot; (e.g. successes, yes votes, etc.) given a fixed number of total occurrences, sampling using a Pólya urn model (in some sense, the &quot;opposite&quot; of sampling without replacement)

=== Categorical outcomes (events with possible outcomes) ===

* Categorical distribution, for a single categorical outcome (e.g. yes/no/maybe in a survey); a generalization of the Bernoulli distribution
* Multinomial distribution, for the number of each type of categorical outcome, given a fixed number of total outcomes; a generalization of the binomial distribution
* Multivariate hypergeometric distribution, similar to the multinomial distribution, but using sampling without replacement; a generalization of the hypergeometric distribution

=== Poisson process (events that occur independently with a given rate) ===

* Poisson distribution, for the number of occurrences of a Poisson-type event in a given period of time
* Exponential distribution, for the time before the next Poisson-type event occurs
* Gamma distribution, for the time before the next k Poisson-type events occur

=== Absolute values of vectors with normally distributed components ===

* Rayleigh distribution, for the distribution of vector magnitudes with Gaussian distributed orthogonal components. Rayleigh distributions are found in RF signals with Gaussian real and imaginary components.
* Rice distribution, a generalization of the Rayleigh distributions for where there is a stationary background signal component. Found in Rician fading of radio signals due to multipath propagation and in MR images with noise corruption on non-zero NMR signals.

=== Normally distributed quantities operated with sum of squares ===

* Chi-squared distribution, the distribution of a sum of squared standard normal variables; useful e.g. for inference regarding the sample variance of normally distributed samples (see chi-squared test)
* Student&#x27;s t distribution, the distribution of the ratio of a standard normal variable and the square root of a scaled chi squared variable; useful for inference regarding the mean of normally distributed samples with unknown variance (see Student&#x27;s t-test)
* F-distribution, the distribution of the ratio of two scaled chi squared variables; useful e.g. for inferences that involve comparing variances or involving R-squared (the squared correlation coefficient)

=== As conjugate prior distributions in Bayesian inference ===
* Beta distribution, for a single probability (real number between 0 and 1); conjugate to the Bernoulli distribution and binomial distribution
* Gamma distribution, for a non-negative scaling parameter; conjugate to the rate parameter of a Poisson distribution or exponential distribution, the precision (inverse variance) of a normal distribution, etc.
* Dirichlet distribution, for a vector of probabilities that must sum to 1; conjugate to the categorical distribution and multinomial distribution; generalization of the beta distribution
*Wishart distribution, for a symmetric non-negative definite matrix; conjugate to the inverse of the covariance matrix of a multivariate normal distribution; generalization of the gamma distribution

=== Some specialized applications of probability distributions ===

* The cache language models and other statistical language models used in natural language processing to assign probabilities to the occurrence of particular words and word sequences do so by means of probability distributions.
* In quantum mechanics, the probability density of finding the particle at a given point is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the particle&#x27;s wavefunction at that point (see Born rule). Therefore, the probability distribution function of the position of a particle is described by formula_154, probability that the particle&#x27;s position will be in the interval in dimension one, and a similar triple integral in dimension three. This is a key principle of quantum mechanics.
* Probabilistic load flow in power-flow study explains the uncertainties of input variables as probability distribution and provides the power flow calculation also in term of probability distribution.
* Prediction of natural phenomena occurrences based on previous frequency distributions such as tropical cyclones, hail, time in between events, etc.

<text>Psychological statistics is application of formulas, theorems, numbers and laws to psychology. 
Statistical methods for psychology include development and application statistical theory and methods for modeling psychological data. 
These methods include psychometrics, factor analysis, experimental designs, and Bayesian statistics. The article also discusses journals in the same field.

==Psychometrics==

Psychometrics deals with measurement of psychological attributes. It involves developing and applying statistical models for mental measurements. The measurement theories are divided into two major areas: (1) Classical test theory; (2) Item Response Theory.

===Classical test theory===

The classical test theory or true score theory or reliability theory in statistics is a set of statistical procedures useful for development of psychological tests and scales. It is based on a fundamental equation, 
X = T + E
where, X is total score, T is a true score and E is error of measurement. For each participant, it assumes that there exist a true score and it need to be obtained score (X) has to be as close to it as possible. The closeness of X has with T is expressed in terms of ratability of the obtained score. The reliability in terms of classical test procedure is correlation between true score and obtained score. The typical test construction procedures has following steps:

(1) Determine the construct 
(2) Outline the behavioral domain of the construct
(3) Write 3 to 5 times more items than desired test length
(4) Get item content analyzed by experts and cull items
(5) Obtain data on initial version of the test 
(6) Item analysis (Statistical Procedure)
(7) Factor analysis (Statistical Procedure)
(8) After the second cull, make final version
(9) Use it for research

====Reliability ====
The reliability is computed in specific ways. 
(A) Inter-Rater reliability: Inter-Rater reliability is estimate of agreement between independent raters. This is most useful for subjective responses. Cohen&#x27;s Kappa, Krippendorff&#x27;s Alpha, Intra-Class correlation coefficients, Correlation coefficients, Kendal&#x27;s concordance coefficient, etc. are useful statistical tools. 
(B) Test-Retest Reliability: Test-Retest Procedure is estimation of temporal consistency of the test. A test is administered twice to the same sample with a time interval. Correlation between two sets of scores is used as an estimate of reliability. Testing conditions are assumed to be identical. 
(C) Internal Consistency Reliability: Internal consistency reliability estimates consistency of items with each other. Split-half reliability (Spearman- Brown Prophecy) and Cronbach Alpha are popular estimates of this reliability. 
(D) Parallel Form Reliability: It is an estimate of consistency between two different instruments of measurement. The inter-correlation between two parallel forms of a test or scale is used as an estimate of parallel form reliability.

====Validity====
Validity of a scale or test is ability of the instrument to measure what it purports to measure. Construct validity, Content Validity, and Criterion Validity are types of validity. 
Construct validity is estimated by convergent and discriminant validity and factor analysis. Convergent and discriminant validity are ascertained by correlation between similar of different constructs. 
Content Validity: Subject matter experts evaluate content validity. 
Criterion Validity is correlation between the test and a criterion variable (or variables) of the construct. Regression analysis, Multiple regression analysis, and Logistic regression are used as an estimate of criterion validity. 
Software applications: The R software has ‘psych’ package that is useful for classical test theory analysis.

===Modern test theory ===
The modern test theory is based on latent trait model. Every item estimates the ability of the test taker. The ability parameter is called as theta (θ). The difficulty parameter is called b. the two important assumptions are local independence and unidimensionality. 
The Item Response Theory has three models. They are one parameter logistic model, two parameter logistic model and three parameter logistic model. In addition, Polychromous IRT Model are also useful.

The R Software has ‘ltm’, packages useful for IRT analysis.

==Factor analysis ==
Factor analysis is at the core of psychological statistics. It has two schools: (1) Exploratory Factor analysis (2) Confirmatory Factor analysis.

===Exploratory factor analysis (EFA)===
The exploratory factor analysis begins without a theory or with a very tentative theory. It is a dimension reduction technique. It is useful in psychometrics, multivariate analysis of data and data analytics. 
Typically a k-dimensional correlation matrix or covariance matrix of variables is reduced to k X r factor pattern matrix where r &lt; k. Principal Component analysis and common factor analysis are two ways of extracting data. Principal axis factoring, ML factor analysis, alpha factor analysis and image factor analysis is most useful ways of EFA. 
It employs various factor rotation methods which can be classified into orthogonal (resulting in uncorrelated factors) and oblique (resulting correlated factors).

The ‘psych’ package in R is useful for EFA.

===Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)===
Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) is a factor analytic technique that begins with a theory and test the theory by carrying out factor analysis. 
The CFA is also called as latent structure analysis, which considers factor as latent variables causing actual observable variables. The basic equation of the CFA is

X = Λξ + δ

where, X is observed variables, Λ are structural coefficients, ξ are latent variables (factors) and δ are errors. 
The parameters are estimated using ML methods however; other methods of estimation are also available. The chi-square test is very sensitive and hence various fit measures are used.
R package ‘sem’, ‘lavaan’ are useful for the same.

==Experimental design==
Experimental methods are very popular in psychology, going back more than 100 years. Experimental psychology is a sub-discipline of psychology .
Statistical methods applied for designing and analyzing experimental psychological data include the t-test, ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA, MANCOVA, binomial test, chi-square, etc.

==Multivariate behavioral research==
Multivariate behavioral research is becoming very popular in psychology. These methods include Multiple Regression and Prediction; Moderated and Mediated Regression Analysis; Logistics Regression; Canonical Correlations; Cluster analysis; Multi-level modeling; Survival-Failure analysis; Structural Equations Modeling; hierarchical linear modelling, etc. are very useful for psychological statistics.

==Journals for statistical applications for psychology==
There are many specialized journals that publish advances in statistical analysis for psychology:

* Psychometrika
* Educational and Psychological Measurement
* Assessment
* American Journal of Evaluation
* Applied Psychological Measurement
* Behavior Research Methods
* British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology
* Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics
* Journal of Mathematical Psychology
* Multivariate Behavioral Research
* Psychological Assessment
* Structural Equation Modeling

==Software packages for psychological research==

Various software packages are available for statistical methods for psychological research. They can be classified as commercial software (e.g., JMP and SPSS) and open-source (e.g., R). Among the open-source offerings, the R software is the most popular. There are many online references for R and specialized books on R for Psychologists are also being written. The &quot;psych&quot; package of R is very useful for psychologists. Among others, &quot;lavaan&quot;, &quot;sem&quot;, &quot;ltm&quot;, &quot;ggplot2&quot; are some of the popular packages. PSPP and KNIME are other free packages. Commercial packages include JMP, SPSS and SAS. JMP and SPSS are commonly reported in books.

<text>Peter Edward Cook (17 November 1937 – 9 January 1995) was an English comedian, actor, satirist, playwright and screenwriter. He was the leading figure of the British satire boom of the 1960s, and he was associated with the anti-establishment comedic movement that emerged in the United Kingdom in the late 1950s.

Born in Torquay, he was educated at the University of Cambridge. There he became involved with the Footlights Club, of which he later became president. After graduating, he created the comedy stage revue &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;, beginning a long-running partnership with Dudley Moore. In 1961, Cook opened the comedy club The Establishment in Soho. In 1965, Cook and Moore began a television career, beginning with &quot;Not Only... But Also&quot;. Cook&#x27;s deadpan monologues contrasted with Moore&#x27;s buffoonery. They received the 1966 British Academy Television Award for Best Entertainment Performance. 

Following the success of the show, the duo appeared together in the films &quot;The Wrong Box&quot; (1966) and &quot;Bedazzled&quot; (1967). Cook and Moore returned to television projects continuing to the late 1970s, including co-presenting &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the United States. From 1978 until his death in 1995, Cook no longer collaborated with Moore, apart from a few cameo appearances, but continued to be a regular performer in British television and film.

Referred to as &quot;the father of modern satire&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2005, Cook was ranked number one in the &quot;Comedians&#x27; Comedian&quot;, a poll of more than 300 comics, comedy writers, producers and directors in the English-speaking world.

==Early life==
Cook was born at his parents&#x27; house, &quot;Shearbridge&quot;, in Middle Warberry Road, Torquay, Devon. He was the only son, and eldest of the three children, of Alexander Edward &quot;Alec&quot; Cook (1906–1984), a colonial civil servant, and his wife Ethel Catherine Margaret (1908–1994), daughter of solicitor Charles Mayo. His father served as a political officer and later as a district officer in Nigeria, then as financial secretary to the colony of Gibraltar, followed by a return to Nigeria as Permanent Secretary of the Eastern Region, based at Enugu. 

Cook&#x27;s grandfather, Edward Arthur Cook (1869–1914), had also been a colonial civil servant, traffic manager for the Federated Malay States Railway in Kuala Lumpur, Malaya. The stress he suffered in the lead-up to an interview regarding promotion led him to commit suicide. His wife, Minnie Jane (1869–1957), daughter of Thomas Wreford, of Thelbridge and Witheridge, Devon, and of Stratford-upon-Avon, of a prominent Devonshire family traced back to 1440, kept this fact secret. Peter Cook only discovered the truth when later researching his family.

Cook was educated at Radley College and then went up to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he read French and German. As a student, Cook initially intended to become a career diplomat like his father, but Britain &quot;had run out of colonies&quot;, as he put it. Although largely apathetic politically, particularly in later life when he displayed a deep distrust of politicians of all hues, he joined the Cambridge University Liberal Club. At Pembroke, Cook performed and wrote comedy sketches as a member of the Cambridge Footlights Club, of which he became president in 1960. His hero was fellow Footlights writer and Cambridge magazine writer David Nobbs.

While still at university, Cook wrote for Kenneth Williams, providing several sketches for Williams&#x27; hit West End comedy revue &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot; and much of the follow-up, &quot;One Over the Eight&quot;, before finding prominence in his own right in a four-man group satirical stage show, &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;, alongside Jonathan Miller, Alan Bennett, and Dudley Moore.

&quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; became a great success in London after being first performed at the Edinburgh Festival and included Cook impersonating the prime minister, Harold Macmillan. This was one of the first occasions satirical political mimicry had been attempted in live theatre, and it shocked audiences. During one performance, Macmillan was in the theatre and Cook departed from his script and attacked him verbally.

==Career==

===1960s===
In 1961, Cook opened The Establishment, a club at 18 Greek Street in Soho in central London, presenting fellow comedians in a nightclub setting, including American Lenny Bruce. Cook later joked that it was a satirical venue modelled on &quot;those wonderful Berlin cabarets ... which did so much to stop the rise of Hitler and prevent the outbreak of the Second World War&quot;. As a members-only venue, it was outside the censorship restrictions. The Establishment&#x27;s regular cabaret performers were Eleanor Bron, John Bird, and John Fortune.

Cook befriended and supported Australian comedian and actor Barry Humphries, who began his British solo career at the club. Humphries said in his autobiography, &quot;My Life As Me&quot;, that he found Cook&#x27;s lack of interest in art and literature off-putting. Dudley Moore&#x27;s jazz trio played in the basement of the club during the early 1960s.

Cook also opened an Establishment club in New York in 1963 and Lenny Bruce performed there, as well.

In 1962, the BBC commissioned a pilot for a television series of satirical sketches based on the Establishment Club, but it was not immediately picked up and Cook went to New York City for a year to perform &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; on Broadway. When he returned, the pilot had been refashioned as &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot; and had made a television star of David Frost, something Cook made no secret of resenting. He complained that Frost&#x27;s success was based on directly copying Cook&#x27;s own stage persona and Cook dubbed him &quot;the bubonic plagiarist&quot;, and said that his only regret in life, according to Alan Bennett, had been saving Frost from drowning. This incident occurred in the summer of 1963, when the rivalry between the two men was at its height. Cook had realised that Frost&#x27;s potential drowning would have looked deliberate if he had not been rescued.

By the mid 1960s the satire boom was coming to an end and Cook said: &quot;England was about to sink giggling into the sea.&quot; Around this time, Cook provided substantial financial backing for the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;, supporting it through difficult periods, particularly in libel trials. Cook invested his own money and solicited investment from his friends. For a time, the magazine was produced from the premises of the Establishment Club. In 1963, Cook married Wendy Snowden. The couple had two daughters, Lucy and Daisy, but the marriage ended in 1970.

Cook&#x27;s first regular television spot was on Granada Television&#x27;s &quot;On the Braden Beat&quot; with Bernard Braden, where he featured his most enduring character: the static, dour and monotonal E. L. Wisty, whom Cook had conceived for Radley College&#x27;s Marionette Society.

Cook&#x27;s comedy partnership with Dudley Moore led to &quot;Not Only... But Also&quot;. This was originally intended by the BBC as a vehicle for Moore&#x27;s music, but Moore invited Cook to write sketches and appear with him. Using few props, they created dry, absurd television that proved hugely popular and lasted for three series between 1965 and 1970. Cook played characters such as Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling and the two men created their Pete and Dud alter egos. Other sketches included &quot;Superthunderstingcar&quot;, a parody of the Gerry Anderson marionette TV shows, and Cook&#x27;s pastiche of 1960s trendy arts documentaries – satirised in a parodic segment on Greta Garbo.

When Cook learned a few years later that the videotapes of the series were to be wiped, a common practice at the time, he offered to buy the recordings from the BBC but was refused because of copyright issues. He suggested he could purchase new tapes so that the BBC would have no need to erase the originals, but this was also turned down. Of the original 22 programmes, only eight still survive complete. A compilation of six half-hour programmes, &quot;The Best of... What&#x27;s Left of... Not Only...But Also&quot; was shown on television and has been released on both VHS and DVD.

With &quot;The Wrong Box&quot; (1966) and &quot;Bedazzled&quot; (1967), Cook and Moore began to act in films together. Directed by Stanley Donen, the underlying story of &quot;Bedazzled&quot; is credited to Cook and Moore and its screenplay to Cook. A comic parody of Faust, it stars Cook as George Spigott (the Devil) who tempts Stanley Moon (Moore), a frustrated, short-order chef, with the promise of gaining his heart&#x27;s desire – the unattainable beauty and waitress at his cafe, Margaret Spencer (Eleanor Bron) – in exchange for his soul, but repeatedly tricks him. The film features cameo appearances by Barry Humphries as Envy and Raquel Welch as Lust. Moore composed the soundtrack music and co-wrote (with Cook) the songs performed in the film. His jazz trio backed Cook on the theme, a parodic anti-love song, which Cook delivered in a deadpan monotone and included his familiar put-down, &quot;you fill me with inertia&quot;.

In 1968, Cook and Moore briefly switched to ATV for four one-hour programmes titled &quot;Goodbye Again&quot;, based on the Pete and Dud characters. Cook&#x27;s increasing alcoholism led him to become reliant on cue cards. The show was not a popular success, owing in part to a strike causing the suspension of the publication of the ITV listings magazine &quot;TV Times&quot;. John Cleese was also a cast member, who would become lifelong friends with Cook and later collaborated on projects together.

===1970s===

In 1970, Cook took over a project initiated by David Frost for a satirical film about an opinion pollster who rises to become Prime Minister of Great Britain. Under Cook&#x27;s guidance, the character became modelled on Frost. The film, &quot;The Rise and Rise of Michael Rimmer&quot;, was not a success, although the cast contained notable names (including Cleese and Graham Chapman, who were co-writers).

Cook became a favourite of the chat show circuit but his effort at hosting such a show for the BBC in 1971, &quot;Where Do I Sit?&quot;, was said by the critics to have been a disappointment. It was axed after only three episodes and was replaced by Michael Parkinson, the start of Parkinson&#x27;s career as a chat show host. Parkinson later asked Cook what his ambitions were, Cook replied jocularly &quot;[...] in fact, my ambition is to shut you up altogether you see!&quot;

Cook and Moore fashioned sketches from &quot;Not Only...But Also&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Again&quot; with new material into the stage revue called &quot;Behind the Fridge&quot;. This show toured Australia in 1972 before transferring to New York City in 1973, retitled as &quot;Good Evening&quot;. Cook frequently appeared on and off stage the worse for drink. Nonetheless, the show proved very popular and it won Tony and Grammy Awards. When it finished, Moore stayed in the United States to pursue his film acting ambitions in Hollywood. Cook returned to Britain and in 1973, married the actress and model Judy Huxtable.
Later, the more risqué humour of Pete and Dud went further on such LPs as &quot;Derek and Clive&quot;. The first recording was initiated by Cook to alleviate boredom during the Broadway run of &quot;Good Evening&quot; and used material conceived years before for the two characters but considered too outrageous. One of these audio recordings was also filmed and therein tensions between the duo are seen to rise. Chris Blackwell circulated bootleg copies to friends in the music business. The popularity of the recording convinced Cook to release it commercially, although Moore was initially reluctant, fearing that his rising fame as a Hollywood star would be undermined. Two further &quot;Derek and Clive&quot; albums were released, the last accompanied by a film.

Cook and Moore hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on 24 January 1976 during the show&#x27;s first season. They did a number of their classic stage routines, including &quot;One Leg Too Few&quot; and &quot;Frog and Peach&quot; among others, in addition to participating in some skits with the show&#x27;s ensemble cast. In 1978, Cook appeared on the British music series &quot;Revolver&quot; as the manager of a ballroom where emerging punk and new wave acts played. For some groups, these were their first appearances on television. Cook&#x27;s acerbic commentary was a distinctive aspect of the programme. In 1979, Cook recorded comedy-segments as B-sides to the Sparks 12-inch singles &quot;Number One Song in Heaven&quot; and &quot;Tryouts for the Human Race&quot;. The main songwriter Ron Mael often began with a banal situation in his lyrics and then went at surreal tangents in the style of Cook and S. J. Perelman.

===Amnesty International performances===
Cook appeared at the first three fund-raising galas staged by Cleese and Martin Lewis on behalf of Amnesty International. From the third show in 1979 the benefits were dubbed &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Balls&quot;. He performed on all three nights of the first show in April 1976, &quot;A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)&quot;, as an individual performer and as a member of the cast of &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;, which reunited for the first time since the 1960s. He also appeared in a Monty Python sketch, taking the place of Eric Idle. Cook was on the cast album of the show and in the film, &quot;Pleasure at Her Majesty&#x27;s&quot;. He was in the second Amnesty gala in May 1977, &quot;An Evening Without Sir Bernard Miles&quot;. It was retitled &quot;The Mermaid Frolics&quot; for the cast album and TV special. Cook performed monologues and skits with Terry Jones.

In June 1979, Cook performed all four nights of &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot;, teaming with Cleese. Cook performed a couple of solo pieces and a sketch with Eleanor Bron. He also led the ensemble in the finale – the &quot;End of the World&quot; sketch from &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;.

In response to a barb in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that the show was recycled material, Cook wrote a satire of the summing-up by Justice Cantley in the trial of former Liberal Party leader Jeremy Thorpe, a summary now widely thought to show bias in favour of Thorpe. Cook performed it that same night (Friday 29 June – the third of the four nights) and the following night. The nine-minute opus, &quot;Entirely a Matter for You&quot;, is considered by many fans and critics to be one of the finest works of Cook&#x27;s career. Along with Cook, producer of the show Martin Lewis brought out an album on Virgin Records entitled &quot;Here Comes the Judge: Live&quot;, containing the live performance together with three studio tracks that further lampooned the Thorpe trial.

Although unable to take part in the 1981 gala, Cook supplied the narration over the animated opening title sequence of the 1982 film of the show. With Lewis, he wrote and voiced radio commercials to advertise the film in the UK. He also hosted a spoof film awards ceremony that was part of the world première of the film in London in March 1982.

Following Cook&#x27;s 1987 stage reunion with Moore for the annual American benefit for the homeless, Comic Relief (not related to the UK Comic Relief benefits), Cook repeated the reunion for a British audience by performing with Moore at the 1989 Amnesty benefit &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Biggest Ball&quot;.

===&quot;Consequences&quot; album===
Cook played multiple roles on the 1977 concept album &quot;Consequences&quot;, written and produced by former 10cc members Kevin Godley and Lol Creme. A mixture of spoken comedy and progressive rock with an environmental subtext, &quot;Consequences&quot; started as a single that Godley and Creme planned to make to demonstrate their invention, an electric guitar effect called the Gizmo, which they developed in 10cc. The project grew into a three-LP box set. The comedy sections were originally intended to be performed by a cast including Spike Milligan and Peter Ustinov, but Godley and Creme eventually settled on Cook once they realised he could perform most parts himself.

The storyline centres on the impending divorce of ineffectual Englishman Walter Stapleton (Cook) and his French wife Lulu (Judy Huxtable). While meeting their lawyers – the bibulous Mr. Haig and overbearing Mr. Pepperman (both played by Cook) – the encroaching global catastrophe interrupts proceedings with bizarre and mysterious happenings, which seem to centre on Mr. Blint (Cook), a musician and composer living in the flat below Haig&#x27;s office, to which it is connected by a large hole in the floor.

Although it has since developed a cult following, &quot;Consequences&quot; was released as punk was sweeping the UK and proved a resounding commercial failure, savaged by critics who found the music self-indulgent. The script and story have evident connections to Cook&#x27;s own life – his then-wife Judy Huxtable plays Walter&#x27;s wife. Cook&#x27;s struggles with alcohol are mirrored in Haig&#x27;s drinking, and there is a parallel between the fictional divorce of Walter and Lulu and Cook&#x27;s own divorce from his first wife. The voice and accent Cook used for the character of Stapleton are similar to those of Cook&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; colleague, Alan Bennett, and a book on Cook&#x27;s comedy, &quot;How Very Interesting: Peter Cook&#x27;s Universe and All That Surrounds It&quot;, speculates that the characters Cook plays in &quot;Consequences&quot; are his verbal caricatures of the four &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; cast members – the alcoholic Haig represents Cook himself, the tremulous Stapleton is Bennett, the parodically Jewish Pepperman is Miller, and the pianist Blint represents Moore.

===1980s===
Cook starred in the LWT special &quot;Peter Cook &amp; Co.&quot; in 1980. The show included comedy sketches, including a &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; parody &quot;Tales of the Much As We Expected&quot;. This involved Cook as Roald Dahl, explaining his name had been Ronald before he dropped the &quot;n&quot;. The cast included Cleese, Rowan Atkinson, Beryl Reid, Paula Wilcox, and Terry Jones. Partly spurred by Moore&#x27;s growing film star status, Cook moved to Hollywood in that year, and appeared as an uptight English butler to a wealthy American woman in a short-lived United States television sitcom, &quot;The Two of Us&quot;, also making cameo appearances in a couple of undistinguished films.

In 1983, Cook played the role of Richard III in the first episode of &quot;Blackadder&quot;, &quot;The Foretelling&quot;, which parodies Laurence Olivier&#x27;s portrayal. In 1984, he played the role of Nigel, the mathematics teacher, in Jeannot Szwarc&#x27;s film &quot;Supergirl&quot;, working alongside the evil Selena played by Faye Dunaway. He then narrated the short film &quot;Diplomatix&quot; by Norwegian comedy trio Kirkvaag, Lystad, and Mjøen, which won the &quot;Special Prize of the City of Montreux&quot; at the Montreux Comedy Festival in 1985. In 1986, he partnered Joan Rivers on her UK talk show. He appeared as Mr Jolly in 1987 in &quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot; episode &quot;Mr. Jolly Lives Next Door&quot;, playing an assassin who covers the sound of his murders by playing Tom Jones records. 

That same year, Cook appeared in &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; as the &quot;Impressive Clergyman&quot; who officiates at the wedding ceremony between Buttercup and Prince Humperdinck. Also that year, he spent time working with humourist Martin Lewis on a political satire about the 1988 US presidential elections for HBO, but the script went unproduced. Lewis suggested that Cook team with Moore for the US Comic Relief telethon for the homeless. The duo reunited and performed their &quot;One Leg Too Few&quot; sketch. Cook again collaborated with Moore for the 1989 Amnesty International benefit show, &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Biggest Ball&quot;.

A 1984 commercial for John Harvey &amp; Sons showed Cook at a poolside party drinking Harvey&#x27;s Bristol Cream sherry. He then says to &quot;throw away those silly little glasses&quot; whereupon the other party guests toss their sunglasses in the swimming pool.

In 1988, Cook appeared as a contestant on the improvisation comedy show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; He was declared the winner, his prize being to read the credits in the style of a New York cab driver – a character he had portrayed in &quot;Peter Cook &amp; Co.&quot;

Cook occasionally called in to Clive Bull&#x27;s night-time phone-in radio show on LBC in London. Using the name &quot;Sven from Swiss Cottage&quot;, he mused on love, loneliness, and herrings in a mock Norwegian accent. Jokes included Sven&#x27;s attempts to find his estranged wife, in which he often claimed to be telephoning the show from all over the world, and his dislike of his fellow Norwegians&#x27; obsession with fish. While Bull was clearly aware that Sven was fictional and was happy to play along with the joke, he did not learn of the caller&#x27;s real identity until later.

===Revival===
In late 1989, Cook married for the third time, to Malaysian-born property developer Chiew Lin Chong in Torbay, Devon. She provided him with some stability in his personal life, and he reduced his drinking to the extent that for a time he was teetotal. He lived alone in a small 18th-century house in Perrins Walk, Hampstead, while she kept her own property just away.

Cook returned to the BBC as Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling for an appearance with Ludovic Kennedy in &quot;A Life in Pieces&quot;. The 12 interviews saw Sir Arthur recount his life, based on the song &quot;Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;. Unscripted interviews with Cook as Streeb-Greebling and satirist Chris Morris were recorded in late 1993 and broadcast as &quot;Why Bother?&quot; on BBC Radio 3 in 1994. Morris described them:

On 17 December 1993, Cook appeared on &quot;Clive Anderson Talks Back&quot; as four characters – biscuit tester and alien abductee Norman House, football manager and motivational speaker Alan Latchley, judge Sir James Beauchamp, and rock legend Eric Daley. The following day, he appeared on BBC2 performing links for &quot;Arena&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Radio Night&quot;. He also appeared in the 1993 Christmas special of &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; (&quot;One Foot in the Algarve&quot;), playing a muckraking tabloid photographer. Before the end of the following year, his mother died, and a grief-stricken Cook returned to heavy drinking. He made his last television appearance on the show &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot; in November 1994.

==Personal life==
Cook was married three times. He was first married to Wendy Snowden, whom he met at university, in 1963. They had two daughters, Lucy and Daisy. They divorced in 1971. Cook then married his second wife, model and actress Judy Huxtable, in 1973, the marriage ending in 1989 after they had been separated for some years. He married his third and final wife, Chiew Lin Chong, in 1989, to whom he remained married until his death. Cook became stepfather to Chong&#x27;s daughter, Nina. Following Cook&#x27;s death, Chong suffered from depression, deriving both from her loss and the difficulties arising from raising Nina, who had learning difficulties. Chong died at the age of 71 in November 2016.

Cook was an avid spectator of most sports (except rugby league) and was a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur football club, though he also maintained support for his hometown team Torquay United.

Cook was a heavy smoker. As a regular interviewee on his friend&#x27;s show, Michael Parkinson, he was usually to be seen with a lighted cigarette in his hand or mouth during their broadcast interviews.

==Death==
Cook died in a coma on 9 January 1995 at the age 57 at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, London, from a gastrointestinal haemorrhage, a complication resulting from years of heavy drinking. His body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, and his ashes were buried in an unmarked plot behind St John-at-Hampstead, not far from his home in Perrins Walk.

Peter&#x27;s wife Lin Cook died in 2016 and her ashes were buried with Peter&#x27;s. A small memorial in the shape of an open book now marks the spot.

Dudley Moore attended Cook&#x27;s memorial service at St John-at-Hampstead on 1 May 1995. He and Martin Lewis presented a two-night memorial for Cook at The Improv in Los Angeles, on 15 and 16 November 1995, to mark what would have been Cook&#x27;s 58th birthday.

==Legacy==
Cook is widely acknowledged as a strong influence on the many British comedians who followed him from the amateur dramatic clubs of British universities to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, and then to radio and television. On his death, some critics choose to see Cook&#x27;s life as tragic, insofar as the brilliance of his youth had not been sustained in his later years. However, Cook maintained he was &quot;comfortable with limited ambition&quot; not necessarily for the sustained international success that Dudley Moore achieved. He assessed happiness by his friendships and his enjoyment of life. Eric Idle said Cook had not wasted his talent, but rather that the newspapers had tried to waste him.

In 1995 premiered &quot;Play Wisty For Me – The Life of Peter Cook&quot;, an original play to pay tribute to Cook.

Several friends honoured him with a dedication in the closing credits of &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot; (1997), a comedy film written by John Cleese about a zoo in peril of being closed. It starred Cleese alongside Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline, and Michael Palin. The dedication displays photos and the lifespan dates of Cook and of naturalist and humorist Gerald Durrell.

In 1999, the minor planet 20468 Petercook, in the main asteroid belt, was named after Cook.

Channel 4 broadcast &quot;Not Only But Always&quot;, a television film dramatising the relationship between Cook and Moore, with Rhys Ifans portraying Cook. At the 2005 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, a play, &quot;Pete and Dud: Come Again&quot; written by Chris Bartlett and Nick Awde, examined the relationship from Moore&#x27;s view. The play was transferred to London&#x27;s West End at The Venue in 2006 and toured the UK the following year. During the West End run, Tom Goodman-Hill starred as Cook, with Kevin Bishop as Moore.

A green plaque to honour Cook was unveiled by the Westminster City Council and the Heritage Foundation at the site of the Establishment Club, at 18 Greek Street, on 15 February 2009.

A blue plaque was unveiled by the Torbay Civic Society on 17 November 2014 at Cook&#x27;s place of birth, &quot;Shearbridge&quot;, Middle Warberry Road, Torquay, with his widow Lin and other members of the family in attendance. A further blue plaque was commissioned and erected at the home of Torquay United, Plainmoor, Torquay, in 2015.

<text>Psychedelic rock is a rock music genre that is inspired, influenced, or representative of psychedelic culture, which is centered on perception-altering hallucinogenic drugs. The music incorporated new electronic sound effects and recording techniques, extended instrumental solos, and improvisation. Many psychedelic groups differ in style, and the label is often applied spuriously.

Originating in the mid-1960s among British and American musicians, the sound of psychedelic rock invokes three core effects of LSD: depersonalization, dechronicization (the bending of time), and dynamization (when fixed, ordinary objects dissolve into moving, dancing structures), all of which detach the user from everyday reality. Musically, the effects may be represented via novelty studio tricks, electronic or non-Western instrumentation, disjunctive song structures, and extended instrumental segments. Some of the earlier 1960s psychedelic rock musicians were based in folk, jazz, and the blues, while others showcased an explicit Indian classical influence called &quot;raga rock&quot;. In the 1960s, there existed two main variants of the genre: the more whimsical, surrealist British psychedelia and the harder American West Coast &quot;acid rock&quot;. While &quot;acid rock&quot; is sometimes deployed interchangeably with the term &quot;psychedelic rock&quot;, it also refers more specifically to the heavier, harder, and more extreme ends of the genre.

The peak years of psychedelic rock were between 1967 and 1969, with milestone events including the 1967 Summer of Love and the 1969 Woodstock Festival, becoming an international musical movement associated with a widespread counterculture before declining as changing attitudes, the loss of some key individuals, and a back-to-basics movement led surviving performers to move into new musical areas. The genre bridged the transition from early blues and folk-based rock to progressive rock and hard rock, and as a result contributed to the development of sub-genres such as heavy metal. Since the late 1970s it has been revived in various forms of neo-psychedelia.

==Definition==

As a musical style, psychedelic rock incorporated new electronic sound effects and recording effects, extended solos, and improvisation. Features mentioned in relation to the genre include:
* electric guitars, often used with feedback, wah-wah and fuzzbox effects units;
* certain studio effects (principally in British psychedelia), such as backwards tapes, panning, flanging, tape loops, and extreme reverb;
* elements of Indian music and other Eastern music, including Middle Eastern modalities;
* non-Western instruments (especially in British psychedelia), specifically those originally used in Indian classical music, such as sitar, tambura and tabla;
* elements of free-form jazz;
* a strong keyboard presence, especially electronic organs, harpsichords, or the Mellotron (an early tape-driven sampler);
* extended instrumental segments, especially guitar solos, or jams;
* disjunctive song structures, occasional key and time signature changes, modal melodies and drones;
* droning quality in vocals;
* electronic instruments such as synthesizers and the theremin;
* lyrics that made direct or indirect reference to hallucinogenic drugs;
* surreal, whimsical, esoterically or literary-inspired lyrics with (especially in British psychedelia) references to childhood;
* Victorian-era antiquation (exclusive to British psychedelia), drawing on items such as music boxes, music hall nostalgia and circus sounds.

The term &quot;psychedelic&quot; was coined in 1956 by psychiatrist Humphry Osmond in a letter to LSD exponent Aldous Huxley and used as an alternative descriptor for hallucinogenic drugs in the context of psychedelic psychotherapy. As the countercultural scene developed in San Francisco, the terms acid rock and psychedelic rock were used in 1966 to describe the new drug-influenced music and were being widely used by 1967. The two terms are often used interchangeably, but acid rock may be distinguished as a more extreme variation that was heavier, louder, relied on long jams, focused more directly on LSD, and made greater use of distortion.

==Original psychedelic era==
===1960–65: Precursors and influences===
Music critic Richie Unterberger says that attempts to &quot;pin down&quot; the first psychedelic record are &quot;nearly as elusive as trying to name the first rock &amp; roll record&quot;. Some of the &quot;far-fetched claims&quot; include the instrumental &quot;Telstar&quot; (produced by Joe Meek for the Tornados in 1962) and the Dave Clark Five&#x27;s &quot;massively reverb-laden&quot; &quot;Any Way You Want It&quot; (1964). The first mention of LSD on a rock record was the Gamblers&#x27; 1960 surf instrumental &quot;LSD 25&quot;. A 1962 single by the Ventures, &quot;The 2000 Pound Bee&quot;, issued forth the buzz of a distorted, &quot;fuzztone&quot; guitar, and the quest into &quot;the possibilities of heavy, transistorised distortion&quot; and other effects, like improved reverb and echo, began in earnest on London&#x27;s fertile rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll scene. By 1964 fuzztone could be heard on singles by P.J. Proby, and the Beatles had employed feedback in &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;, their sixth consecutive number 1 hit in the UK.

According to AllMusic, the emergence of psychedelic rock in the mid-1960s resulted from British groups who made up the British Invasion of the US market and folk rock bands seeking to broaden &quot;the sonic possibilities of their music&quot;. Writing in his 1969 book &quot;The Rock Revolution&quot;, Arnold Shaw said the genre in its American form represented generational escapism, which he identified as a development of youth culture&#x27;s &quot;protest against the sexual taboos, racism, violence, hypocrisy and materialism of adult life&quot;.

American folk singer Bob Dylan&#x27;s influence was central to the creation of the folk rock movement in 1965, and his lyrics remained a touchstone for the psychedelic songwriters of the late 1960s. Virtuoso sitarist Ravi Shankar had begun in 1956 a mission to bring Indian classical music to the West, inspiring jazz, classical and folk musicians. By the mid-1960s, his influence extended to a generation of young rock musicians who soon made raga rock part of the psychedelic rock aesthetic and one of the many intersecting cultural motifs of the era. In the British folk scene, blues, drugs, jazz and Eastern influences blended in the early 1960s work of Davy Graham, who adopted modal guitar tunings to transpose Indian ragas and Celtic reels. Graham was highly influential on Scottish folk virtuoso Bert Jansch and other pioneering guitarists across a spectrum of styles and genres in the mid-1960s. Jazz saxophonist and composer John Coltrane had a similar impact, as the exotic sounds on his albums &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; (1960) and &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; (1965), the latter influenced by the ragas of Shankar, were source material for guitar players and others looking to improvise or &quot;jam&quot;.

One of the first musical uses of the term &quot;psychedelic&quot; in the folk scene was by the New York-based folk group The Holy Modal Rounders on their version of Lead Belly&#x27;s &#x27;Hesitation Blues&#x27; in 1964. Folk/avant-garde guitarist John Fahey recorded several songs in the early 1960s experimented with unusual recording techniques, including backwards tapes, and novel instrumental accompaniment including flute and sitar. His nineteen-minute &quot;The Great San Bernardino Birthday Party&quot; &quot;anticipated elements of psychedelia with its nervy improvisations and odd guitar tunings&quot;. Similarly, folk guitarist Sandy Bull&#x27;s early work &quot;incorporated elements of folk, jazz, and Indian and Arabic-influenced dronish modes&quot;. His 1963 album &quot;Fantasias for Guitar and Banjo&quot; explores various styles and &quot;could also be accurately described as one of the very first psychedelic records&quot;.

===1965: Formative psychedelic scenes and sounds===


Barry Miles, a leading figure in the 1960s UK underground, says that &quot;Hippies didn&#x27;t just pop up overnight&quot; and that &quot;1965 was the first year in which a discernible youth movement began to emerge [in the US]. Many of the key &#x27;psychedelic&#x27; rock bands formed this year.&quot; On the US West Coast, underground chemist Augustus Owsley Stanley III and Ken Kesey (along with his followers known as the Merry Pranksters) helped thousands of people take uncontrolled trips at Kesey&#x27;s Acid Tests and in the new psychedelic dance halls. In Britain, Michael Hollingshead opened the World Psychedelic Centre and Beat Generation poets Allen Ginsberg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gregory Corso read at the Royal Albert Hall. Miles adds: &quot;The readings acted as a catalyst for underground activity in London, as people suddenly realized just how many like-minded people there were around. This was also the year that London began to blossom into colour with the opening of the Granny Takes a Trip and Hung On You clothes shops.&quot; Thanks to media coverage, use of LSD became widespread.

According to music critic Jim DeRogatis, writing in his book on psychedelic rock, &quot;Turn on Your Mind&quot;, the Beatles are seen as the &quot;Acid Apostles of the New Age&quot;. Producer George Martin, who was initially known as a specialist in comedy and novelty records, responded to the Beatles&#x27; requests by providing a range of studio tricks that ensured the group played a leading role in the development of psychedelic effects. Anticipating their overtly psychedelic work, &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; (April 1965) introduced a subtle, drug-inspired drone suggestive of India, played on rhythm guitar. Musicologist William Echard writes that the Beatles employed several techniques in the years up to 1965 that soon became elements of psychedelic music, an approach he describes as &quot;cognate&quot; and reflective of how they, like the Yardbirds, were early pioneers in psychedelia. As important aspects the group brought to the genre, Echard cites the Beatles&#x27; rhythmic originality and unpredictability; &quot;true&quot; tonal ambiguity; leadership in incorporating elements from Indian music and studio techniques such as vari-speed, tape loops and reverse tape sounds; and their embrace of the avant-garde.

In Unterberger&#x27;s opinion, the Byrds, emerging from the Los Angeles folk rock scene, and the Yardbirds, from England&#x27;s blues scene, were more responsible than the Beatles for &quot;sounding the psychedelic siren&quot;. Drug use and attempts at psychedelic music moved out of acoustic folk-based music towards rock soon after the Byrds, inspired by the Beatles&#x27; 1964 film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, adopted electric instruments to produce a chart-topping version of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; in the summer of 1965. On the Yardbirds, Unterberger identifies lead guitarist Jeff Beck as having &quot;laid the blueprint for psychedelic guitar&quot;, and says that their &quot;ominous minor key melodies, hyperactive instrumental breaks (called rave-ups), unpredictable tempo changes, and use of Gregorian chants&quot; helped to define the &quot;manic eclecticism&quot; typical of early psychedelic rock. The band&#x27;s &quot;Heart Full of Soul&quot; (June 1965), which includes a distorted guitar riff that replicates the sound of a sitar, peaked at number 2 in the UK and number 9 in the US. In Echard&#x27;s description, the song &quot;carried the energy of a new scene&quot; as the guitar-hero phenomenon emerged in rock, and it heralded the arrival of new Eastern sounds. The Kinks provided the first example of sustained Indian-style drone in rock when they used open-tuned guitars to mimic the tambura on &quot;See My Friends&quot; (July 1965), which became a top 10 hit in the UK.
The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; from the December 1965 album &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; marked the first released recording on which a member of a Western rock group played the sitar. The song sparked a craze for the sitar and other Indian instrumentation – a trend that fueled the growth of raga rock as the India exotic became part of the essence of psychedelic rock. Music historian George Case recognises &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; as the first of two Beatles albums that &quot;marked the authentic beginning of the psychedelic era&quot;, while music critic Robert Christgau similarly wrote that &quot;Psychedelia starts here&quot;. San Francisco historian Charles Perry recalled the album being &quot;the soundtrack of the Haight-Ashbury, Berkeley and the whole circuit&quot;, as pre-hippie youths suspected that the songs were inspired by drugs.
Although psychedelia was introduced in Los Angeles through the Byrds, according to Shaw, San Francisco emerged as the movement&#x27;s capital on the West Coast. Several California-based folk acts followed the Byrds into folk rock, bringing their psychedelic influences with them, to produce the &quot;San Francisco Sound&quot;. Music historian Simon Philo writes that although some commentators would state that the centre of influence had moved from London to California by 1967, it was British acts like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones that helped inspire and &quot;nourish&quot; the new American music in the mid-1960s, especially in the formative San Francisco scene. The music scene there developed in the city&#x27;s Haight-Ashbury neighborhood in 1965 at basement shows organised by Chet Helms of the Family Dog; and as Jefferson Airplane founder Marty Balin and investors opened The Matrix nightclub that summer and began booking his and other local bands such as the Grateful Dead, the Steve Miller Band and Country Joe &amp; the Fish. Helms and San Francisco Mime Troupe manager Bill Graham in the fall of 1965 organised larger scale multi-media community events/benefits featuring the Airplane, the Diggers and Allen Ginsberg. By early 1966 Graham had secured booking at The Fillmore, and Helms at the Avalon Ballroom, where in-house psychedelic-themed light shows replicated the visual effects of the psychedelic experience. Graham became a major figure in the growth of psychedelic rock, attracting most of the major psychedelic rock bands of the day to The Fillmore.

According to author Kevin McEneaney, the Grateful Dead &quot;invented&quot; acid rock in front of a crowd of concertgoers in San Jose, California on 4 December 1965, the date of the second Acid Test held by novelist Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. Their stage performance involved the use of strobe lights to reproduce LSD&#x27;s &quot;surrealistic fragmenting&quot; or &quot;vivid isolating of caught moments&quot;. The Acid Test experiments subsequently launched the entire psychedelic subculture.

===1966: Growth and early popularity===


Echard writes that in 1966, &quot;the psychedelic implications&quot; advanced by recent rock experiments &quot;became fully explicit and much more widely distributed&quot;, and by the end of the year, &quot;most of the key elements of psychedelic topicality had been at least broached.&quot; DeRogatis says the start of psychedelic (or acid) rock is &quot;best listed at 1966&quot;. Music journalists Pete Prown and Harvey P. Newquist locate the &quot;peak years&quot; of psychedelic rock between 1966 and 1969. In 1966, media coverage of rock music changed considerably as the music became reevaluated as a new form of art in tandem with the growing psychedelic community.

In February and March, two singles were released that later achieved recognition as the first psychedelic hits: the Yardbirds&#x27; &quot;Shapes of Things&quot; and the Byrds&#x27; &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;. The former reached number 3 in the UK and number 11 in the US, and continued the Yardbirds&#x27; exploration of guitar effects, Eastern-sounding scales, and shifting rhythms. By overdubbing guitar parts, Beck layered multiple takes for his solo, which included extensive use of fuzz tone and harmonic feedback. The song&#x27;s lyrics, which Unterberger describes as &quot;stream-of-consciousness&quot;, have been interpreted as pro-environmental or anti-war. The Yardbirds became the first British band to have the term &quot;psychedelic&quot; applied to one of its songs. On &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;, Roger McGuinn&#x27;s 12-string Rickenbacker guitar provided a psychedelic interpretation of free jazz and Indian raga, channelling Coltrane and Shankar, respectively. The song&#x27;s lyrics were widely taken to refer to drug use, although the Byrds denied it at the time. &quot;Eight Miles High&quot; peaked at number 14 in the US and reached the top 30 in the UK.

Contributing to psychedelia&#x27;s emergence into the pop mainstream was the release of the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (May 1966) and the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolver&quot; (August 1966). Often considered one of the earliest albums in the canon of psychedelic rock, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; contained many elements that would be incorporated into psychedelia, with its artful experiments, psychedelic lyrics based on emotional longings and self-doubts, elaborate sound effects and new sounds on both conventional and unconventional instruments. The album track &quot;I Just Wasn&#x27;t Made for These Times&quot; contained the first use of theremin sounds on a rock record. Scholar Philip Auslander says that even though psychedelic music is not normally associated with the Beach Boys, the &quot;odd directions&quot; and experiments in &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; &quot;put it all on the map. ... basically that sort of opened the door – not for groups to be formed or to start to make music, but certainly to become as visible as say Jefferson Airplane or somebody like that.&quot;

DeRogatis views &quot;Revolver&quot; as another of &quot;the first psychedelic rock masterpieces&quot;, along with &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. The Beatles&#x27; May 1966 B-side &quot;Rain&quot;, recorded during the &quot;Revolver&quot; sessions, was the first pop recording to contain reversed sounds. Together with further studio tricks such as varispeed, the song includes a droning melody that reflected the band&#x27;s growing interest in non-Western musical form and lyrics conveying the division between an enlightened psychedelic outlook and conformism. Philo cites &quot;Rain&quot; as &quot;the birth of British psychedelic rock&quot; and describes &quot;Revolver&quot; as &quot;[the] most sustained deployment of Indian instruments, musical form and even religious philosophy&quot; heard in popular music up to that time. Author Steve Turner recognises the Beatles&#x27; success in conveying an LSD-inspired worldview on &quot;Revolver&quot;, particularly with &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, as having &quot;opened the doors to psychedelic rock (or acid rock)&quot;. In author Shawn Levy&#x27;s description, it was &quot;the first true drug album, not [just] a pop record with some druggy insinuations&quot;, while musicologists Russell Reising and Jim LeBlanc credit the Beatles with &quot;set[ting] the stage for an important subgenre of psychedelic music, that of the messianic pronouncement&quot;.

Echard highlights early records by the 13th Floor Elevators and Love among the key psychedelic releases of 1966, along with &quot;Shapes of Things&quot;, &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot;. Originating from Austin, Texas, the first of these new bands came to the genre via the garage scene before releasing their debut album, &quot;The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators&quot; in October that year. It was one of the first rock albums to include the adjective in its title, although the LP was released on an independent label and was little noticed at the time. Two other bands also used the word in titles of LPs released in November 1966: The Blues Magoos&#x27; &quot;Psychedelic Lollipop&quot;, and the Deep&#x27;s &quot;Psychedelic Moods&quot;. Having formed in late 1965 with the aim of spreading LSD consciousness, the Elevators commissioned business cards containing an image of the third eye and the caption &quot;Psychedelic rock&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; highlights the 13th Floor Elevators as arguably &quot;the most important early progenitors of psychedelic garage rock&quot;.

Donovan&#x27;s July 1966 single &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; became one of the first psychedelic pop/rock singles to top the Billboard charts in the US. Influenced by Aldous Huxley’s &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot;, and with lyrics referencing LSD, it contributed to bringing psychedelia to the mainstream.
The Beach Boys&#x27; October 1966 single &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; was another early pop song to incorporate psychedelic lyrics and sounds. The single&#x27;s success prompted an unexpected revival in theremins and increased the awareness of analog synthesizers. As psychedelia gained prominence, Beach Boys-style harmonies would be ingrained into the newer psychedelic pop.

===1967–69: Continued development===
====Peak era====

In 1967, psychedelic rock received widespread media attention and a larger audience beyond local psychedelic communities. From 1967 to 1968, it was the prevailing sound of rock music, either in the more whimsical British variant, or the harder American West Coast acid rock. Music historian David Simonelli says the genre&#x27;s commercial peak lasted &quot;a brief year&quot;, with San Francisco and London recognised as the two key cultural centres. Compared with the American form, British psychedelic music was often more arty in its experimentation, and it tended to stick within pop song structures. Music journalist Mark Prendergast writes that it was only in US garage-band psychedelia that the often whimsical traits of UK psychedelic music were found. He says that aside from the work of the Byrds, Love and the Doors, there were three categories of US psychedelia: the &quot;acid jams&quot; of the San Francisco bands, who favoured albums over singles; pop psychedelia typified by groups such as the Beach Boys and Buffalo Springfield; and the &quot;wigged-out&quot; music of bands following in the example of the Beatles and the Yardbirds, such as the Electric Prunes, the Nazz, the Chocolate Watchband and the Seeds.

The Doors&#x27; self-titled debut album (January 1967) is notable for possessing a darker sound and subject matter than many contemporary psychedelic albums, which would become very influential to the later Gothic rock movement. Aided by the No. 1 single, &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, the album became very successful, reaching number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart.

In February 1967, the Beatles released the double A-side single &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; / &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, which Ian MacDonald says launched both the &quot;English pop-pastoral mood&quot; typified by bands such as Pink Floyd, Family, Traffic and Fairport Convention, and English psychedelia&#x27;s LSD-inspired preoccupation with &quot;nostalgia for the innocent vision of a child&quot;. The Mellotron parts on &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; remain the most celebrated example of the instrument on a pop or rock recording. According to Simonelli, the two songs heralded the Beatles&#x27; brand of Romanticism as a central tenet of psychedelic rock.

Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot; (February 1967) was one of the first albums to come out of San Francisco that sold well enough to bring national attention to the city&#x27;s music scene. The LP tracks &quot;White Rabbit&quot; and &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; subsequently became top 10 hits in the US.

The Hollies psychedelic B-side &quot;All the World Is Love&quot; (February 1967) was released as the flipside to the hit single &quot;On a Carousel&quot;.

Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; (March 1967) and &quot;See Emily Play&quot; (June 1967), both written by Syd Barrett, helped set the pattern for pop-psychedelia in the UK. There, &quot;underground&quot; venues like the UFO Club, Middle Earth Club, The Roundhouse, the Country Club and the Art Lab drew capacity audiences with psychedelic rock and ground-breaking liquid light shows. A major figure in the development of British psychedelia was the American promoter and record producer Joe Boyd, who moved to London in 1966. He co-founded venues including the UFO Club, produced Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Arnold Layne&quot;, and went on to manage folk and folk rock acts including Nick Drake, the Incredible String Band and Fairport Convention.

Psychedelic rock&#x27;s popularity accelerated following the release of the Beatles&#x27; album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (May 1967) and the staging of the Monterey Pop Festival in June. &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was the first commercially successful work that critics recognised as a landmark aspect of psychedelia, and the Beatles&#x27; mass appeal meant that the record was played virtually everywhere. The album was highly influential on bands in the US psychedelic rock scene and its elevation of the LP format benefited the San Francisco bands. Among many changes brought about by its success, artists sought to imitate its psychedelic effects and devoted more time to creating their albums; the counterculture was scrutinised by musicians; and acts adopted its non-conformist sentiments.

The 1967 Summer of Love saw a huge number of young people from across America and the world travel to Haight-Ashbury, boosting the area&#x27;s population from 15,000 to around 100,000. It was prefaced by the Human Be-In event in January and reached its peak at the Monterey Pop Festival in June, the latter helping to make major American stars of Janis Joplin, lead singer of Big Brother and the Holding Company, Jimi Hendrix, and the Who. Several established British acts joined the psychedelic revolution, including Eric Burdon (previously of the Animals) and the Who, whose &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; (December 1967) included the psychedelic-influenced &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot; and &quot;Armenia City in the Sky&quot;. Other major British Invasion acts who absorbed psychedelia in 1967 include the Hollies with the album &quot;Butterfly&quot;, and The Rolling Stones album &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;. The Incredible String Band&#x27;s &quot;The 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion&quot; (July 1967) developed their folk music into a pastoral form of psychedelia.

Many famous established recording artists from the early rock era also fell under psychedelia and recorded psychedelic-inspired tracks, including Del Shannon&#x27;s &quot;Color Flashing Hair&quot;, Bobby Vee&#x27;s &quot;I May Be Gone&quot;, The Four Seasons&#x27; &quot;Watch the Flowers Grow&quot;, Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;Southbound Jericho Parkway&quot; and The Everly Brothers&#x27; &quot;Mary Jane&quot;.

According to author Edward Macan, there ultimately existed three distinct branches of British psychedelic music. The first, dominated by Cream, the Yardbirds and Hendrix, was founded on a heavy, electric adaptation of the blues played by the Rolling Stones, adding elements such as the Who&#x27;s power chord style and feedback. The second, considerably more complex form drew strongly from jazz sources and was typified by Traffic, Colosseum, If, and Canterbury scene bands such as Soft Machine and Caravan. The third branch, represented by the Moody Blues, Pink Floyd, Procol Harum and the Nice, was influenced by the later music of the Beatles. Several of the post-&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; English psychedelic groups developed the Beatles&#x27; classical influences further than either the Beatles or contemporaneous West Coast psychedelic bands. Among such groups, the Pretty Things abandoned their R&amp;B roots to create &quot;S.F. Sorrow&quot; (December 1968), the first example of a psychedelic rock opera.

====International variants====
The US and UK were the major centres of psychedelic music, but in the late 1960s scenes developed across the world, including continental Europe, Australasia, Asia and south and Central America. In the later 1960s psychedelic scenes developed in a large number of countries in continental Europe, including the Netherlands with bands like The Outsiders, Denmark, where it was pioneered by Steppeulvene, Yugoslavia, with bands like Kameleoni, Dogovor iz 1804., Pop Mašina and Igra Staklenih Perli, and Germany, where musicians fused music of psychedelia and the electronic avant-garde. 1968 saw the first major German rock festival, the in Essen, and the foundation of the Zodiak Free Arts Lab in Berlin by Hans-Joachim Roedelius, and Conrad Schnitzler, which helped bands like Tangerine Dream and Amon Düül achieve cult status.

A thriving psychedelic music scene in Cambodia, influenced by psychedelic rock and soul broadcast by US forces radio in Vietnam, was pioneered by artists such as Sinn Sisamouth and Ros Serey Sothea. In South Korea, Shin Jung-Hyeon, often considered the godfather of Korean rock, played psychedelic-influenced music for the American soldiers stationed in the country. Following Shin Jung-Hyeon, the band San Ul Lim (Mountain Echo) often combined psychedelic rock with a more folk sound. In Turkey, Anatolian rock artist Erkin Koray blended classic Turkish music and Middle Eastern themes into his psychedelic-driven rock, helping to found the Turkish rock scene with artists such as Cem Karaca, Mogollar, Barış Manço and Erkin Koray. In Brazil, the Tropicalia movement merged Brazilian and African rhythms with psychedelic rock. Musicians who were part of the movement include Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Os Mutantes, Gal Costa, Tom Zé, and the poet/lyricist Torquato Neto, all of whom participated in the 1968 album &quot;Tropicália: ou Panis et Circencis&quot;, which served as a musical manifesto.

===1969–71: Decline===
By the end of the 1960s, psychedelic rock was in retreat. Psychedelic trends climaxed in the 1969 Woodstock Festival, which saw performances by most of the major psychedelic acts, including Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead. LSD had been made illegal in the United Kingdom in September 1966 and in California in October; by 1967, it was outlawed throughout the United States. In 1969, the murders of Sharon Tate and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca by Charles Manson and his cult of followers, claiming to have been inspired by The Beatles&#x27; songs such as &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, has been seen as contributing to an anti-hippie backlash. At the end of the same year, the Altamont Free Concert in California, headlined by the Rolling Stones, became notorious for the fatal stabbing of black teenager Meredith Hunter by Hells Angels security guards.

George Clinton&#x27;s ensembles Funkadelic and Parliament and their various spin-offs took psychedelia and funk to create their own unique style, producing over forty singles, including three in the US top ten, and three platinum albums.

Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones, Peter Green and Danny Kirwan of Fleetwood Mac, Skip Spence of Jefferson Airplane and Moby Grape, and Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd suffered permanent brain damage from the use of hallucinogens, with their departures helping to shift the focus of the respective bands of which they had been leading figures. Some groups, such as the Beatles, the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Cream, broke up. Hendrix died in London in September 1970, shortly after recording &quot;Band of Gypsys&quot; (1970), Janis Joplin died of a heroin overdose in October 1970 and they were closely followed by Jim Morrison of the Doors, who died in Paris in July 1971. By this point, many surviving acts had moved away from psychedelia into either more back-to-basics &quot;roots rock&quot;, traditional-based, pastoral or whimsical folk, the wider experimentation of progressive rock, or riff-based heavy rock. 

Record executive Mike Curb was instrumental in having musicians who were promoting drug use dropped from or forced out of MGM Records, where Curb was employed in 1970, replacing them with acts not known for drug use but were known for their conservative appeal, most prominently the Osmonds.

==Revivals and successors==
===Psychedelic soul===
Following the lead of Hendrix in rock, psychedelia influenced African American musicians, particularly the stars of the Motown label. This psychedelic soul was influenced by the civil rights movement, giving it a darker and more political edge than much psychedelic rock. Building on the funk sound of James Brown, it was pioneered from about 1968 by Sly and the Family Stone and The Temptations. Acts that followed them into this territory included Edwin Starr and the Undisputed Truth. George Clinton&#x27;s interdependent Funkadelic and Parliament ensembles and their various spin-offs took the genre to its most extreme lengths, making funk almost a religion in the 1970s, producing over forty singles, including three in the US top ten, and three platinum albums.

While psychedelic rock wavered at the end of the 1960s, psychedelic soul continued into the 1970s, peaking in popularity in the early years of the decade, and only disappearing in the late 1970s as tastes changed. Songwriter Norman Whitfield wrote psychedelic soul songs for The Temptations and Marvin Gaye.

===Prog, heavy metal, and krautrock===
Many of the British musicians and bands that had embraced psychedelia went on to create progressive rock in the 1970s, including Pink Floyd, Soft Machine and members of Yes. The Moody Blues album &quot;In Search of the Lost Chord&quot; (1968), which is steeped in psychedelia, including prominent use of Indian instruments, is noted as an early predecessor to and influence on the emerging progressive movement. King Crimson&#x27;s album &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; (1969) has been seen as an important link between psychedelia and progressive rock. While bands such as Hawkwind maintained an explicitly psychedelic course into the 1970s, most dropped the psychedelic elements in favour of wider experimentation. The incorporation of jazz into the music of bands like Soft Machine and Can also contributed to the development of the jazz rock of bands like Colosseum. As they moved away from their psychedelic roots and placed increasing emphasis on electronic experimentation, German bands like Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, Can, Neu! and Faust developed a distinctive brand of electronic rock, known as kosmische musik, or in the British press as &quot;Kraut rock&quot;. The adoption of electronic synthesisers, pioneered by Popol Vuh from 1970, together with the work of figures like Brian Eno (for a time the keyboard player with Roxy Music), would be a major influence on subsequent electronic rock.

Psychedelic rock, with its distorted guitar sound, extended solos and adventurous compositions, has been seen as an important bridge between blues-oriented rock and later heavy metal. American bands whose loud, repetitive psychedelic rock emerged as early heavy metal included the Amboy Dukes and Steppenwolf. From England, two former guitarists with the Yardbirds, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page, moved on to form key acts in the genre, The Jeff Beck Group and Led Zeppelin respectively. Other major pioneers of the genre had begun as blues-based psychedelic bands, including Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Judas Priest and UFO. Psychedelic music also contributed to the origins of glam rock, with Marc Bolan changing his psychedelic folk duo into rock band T. Rex and becoming the first glam rock star from 1970. From 1971 David Bowie moved on from his early psychedelic work to develop his Ziggy Stardust persona, incorporating elements of professional make up, mime and performance into his act.

The jam band movement, which began in the late 1980s, was influenced by the Grateful Dead&#x27;s improvisational and psychedelic musical style. The Vermont band Phish developed a sizable and devoted fan following during the 1990s, and were described as &quot;heirs&quot; to the Grateful Dead after the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995.

Emerging in the 1990s, stoner rock combined elements of psychedelic rock and doom metal. Typically using a slow-to-mid tempo and featuring low-tuned guitars in a bass-heavy sound, with melodic vocals, and &#x27;retro&#x27; production, it was pioneered by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep. Modern festivals focusing on psychedelic music include Austin Psych Fest in Texas, founded in 2008, Liverpool Psych Fest, and Desert Daze in Southern California.

===Neo-psychedelia===
There were occasional mainstream acts that dabbled in neo-psychedelia, a style of music which emerged in late 1970s post-punk circles. Although it has mainly been an influence on alternative and indie rock bands, neo-psychedelia sometimes updated the approach of 1960s psychedelic rock. Neo-psychedelia may include forays into psychedelic pop, jangly guitar rock, heavily distorted free-form jams, or recording experiments. Some of the scene&#x27;s bands, including the Soft Boys, the Teardrop Explodes, Wah!, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, became major figures of neo-psychedelia. In the US in the early 1980s it was joined by the Paisley Underground movement, based in Los Angeles and fronted by acts such as Dream Syndicate, the Bangles and Rain Parade. 

In the late &#x27;80s in the UK the genre of Madchester emerged in the Manchester area, in which artists merged alternative rock with acid house and dance culture as well as other sources, including psychedelic music and 1960s pop. The label was popularised by the British music press in the early 1990s. Erchard talks about it as being part of a &quot;thread of 80s psychedelic rock&quot; and lists as main bands in it the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays and Inspiral Carpets. The rave-influenced scene is widely seen as heavily influenced by drugs, especially ecstasy (MDMA), and it is seen by Erchard as central to a wider phenomenon of what he calls a &quot;rock rave crossover&quot; in the late &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s UK indie scene, which also included the &quot;Screamadelica&quot; album by Scottish band Primal Scream.

In the 1990s, Elephant 6 collective bands such as The Olivia Tremor Control and The Apples in Stereo mixed the genre with lo-fi influences.

Later according to Treblezine″s Jeff Telrich: &quot;Primal Scream made [neo-psychedelia] dancefloor ready. The Flaming Lips and Spiritualized took it to orchestral realms. And Animal Collective—well, they kinda did their own thing.&quot;

<text>Koninklijke Philips N.V. (), commonly shortened to Philips, is a Dutch multinational conglomerate corporation that was founded in Eindhoven in 1891. Since 1997, its world headquarters have been situated in Amsterdam, though the Benelux headquarters is still in Eindhoven. The company gained its royal honorary title in 1998. 

Philips was founded by Gerard Philips and his father Frederik, with their first products being light bulbs. Through the 20th century, it grew into one of the world&#x27;s largest electronics conglomerates, with global market dominance in products ranging from kitchen appliances and electric shavers to light bulbs, televisions, cassettes, and compact discs (both of which were invented by Philips). At one point, it played a dominant role in the entertainment industry (through PolyGram). However, intense competition from primarily East Asian competitors throughout the 1990s and 2000s led to a period of downsizing, including the divestment of its lighting and consumer electronics divisions, and Philips&#x27; eventual reorganization into a healthcare-focused company.

As of 2024, Philips is organized into three main divisions: Diagnosis and Treatment (manufacturing healthcare products such as MRI, CT and ultrasound scanners), Connected Care (manufacturing patient monitors, as well as respiratory care products under the Respironics brand), and Personal Health (manufacturing electric shavers, Sonicare electric toothbrushes and Avent childcare products).

Philips has a primary listing on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange and is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index. It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Acquisitions included Signetics and Magnavox. It also founded a multidisciplinary sports club called PSV Eindhoven in 1913.

==History==
The Philips Company was founded in 1891, by Dutch entrepreneur Gerard Philips and his father Frederik Philips. Frederik, a banker based in Zaltbommel, financed the purchase and setup of an empty factory building in Eindhoven, where the company started the production of carbon-filament lamps and other electro-technical products in 1892. This first factory has since been adapted and is used as a museum.
In 1895, after a difficult first few years and near-bankruptcy, the Philipses brought in Anton, Gerard&#x27;s younger brother by sixteen years. Though he had earned a degree in engineering, Anton started work as a sales representative; soon, however, he began to contribute many important business ideas. With Anton&#x27;s arrival, the family business began to expand rapidly, resulting in the founding of Philips Metaalgloeilampfabriek N.V. (Philips Metal Filament Lamp Factory Ltd.) in Eindhoven in 1908, followed in 1912, by the foundation of Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken N.V. (Philips Lightbulb Factories Ltd.). After Gerard and Anton Philips changed their family business by founding the Philips corporation, they laid the foundations for the later multinational company.

In the 1920s, the company started to manufacture other products, such as vacuum tubes. For this purpose the Van Arkel–de Boer process was invented.

In 1924, Philips joined with German lamp trust Osram to form the Phoebus cartel.

=== Radio ===

On 11 March 1927, Philips went on the air, inaugurating the shortwave radio station PCJJ (later PCJ) which was joined in 1929 by a sister station (Philips Omroep Holland-Indië, later PHI). PHOHI broadcast in Dutch to the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), and later PHI broadcast in English and other languages to the Eastern hemisphere, while PCJJ broadcast in English, Spanish and German to the rest of the world.

The international program Sundays commenced in 1928, with host Eddie Startz hosting the &quot;Happy Station&quot; show, which became the world&#x27;s longest-running shortwave program. Broadcasts from the Netherlands were interrupted by the German invasion in May 1940. The Germans commandeered the transmitters in Huizen to use for pro-Nazi broadcasts, some originating from Germany, others concerts from Dutch broadcasters under German control.
In the early 1930s, Philips introduced the &quot;Chapel&quot;, a radio with a built-in loudspeaker.

Philips Radio was absorbed shortly after liberation when its two shortwave stations were nationalized in 1947 and renamed Radio Netherlands Worldwide, the Dutch International Service. Some PCJ programs, such as &quot;Happy Station&quot;, continued on the new station.

===Stirling engine===
Philips was instrumental in the revival of the Stirling engine when, in the early 1930s, the management decided that offering a low-power portable generator would assist in expanding sales of its radios into parts of the world where mains electricity was unavailable and the supply of batteries uncertain. Engineers at the company&#x27;s research lab carried out a systematic comparison of various power sources and determined that the almost forgotten Stirling engine would be most suitable, citing its quiet operation (both audibly and in terms of radio interference) and ability to run on a variety of heat sources (common lamp oil – &quot;cheap and available everywhere&quot; – was favored). They were also aware that, unlike steam and internal combustion engines, virtually no serious development work had been carried out on the Stirling engine for many years and asserted that modern materials and know-how should enable great improvements.

Encouraged by their first experimental engine, which produced 16 W of shaft power from a bore and stroke of , various development models were produced in a program which continued throughout World War II. By the late 1940s, the &quot;Type 10&quot; was ready to be handed over to Philips&#x27; subsidiary Johan de Witt in Dordrecht to be produced and incorporated into a generator set as originally planned. The result, rated at 180/200 W electrical output from a bore and stroke of , was designated MP1002CA (known as the &quot;Bungalow set&quot;). Production of an initial batch of 250 began in 1951, but it became clear that they could not be made at a competitive price, besides the advent of transistor radios with their much lower power requirements meant that the original rationale for the set was disappearing. Approximately 150 of these sets were eventually produced.

In parallel with the generator set, Philips developed experimental Stirling engines for a wide variety of applications and continued to work in the field until the late 1970s, though the only commercial success was the &quot;reversed Stirling engine&quot; cryocooler. However, they filed a large number of patents and amassed a wealth of information, which they later licensed to other companies.

===Shavers===
The first Philips shaver was introduced in 1939, and was simply called Philishave. In the US, it was called Norelco. The Philishave has remained part of the Philips product line-up until the present.

===World War II===
On 9 May 1940, the Philips directors learned that the German invasion of the Netherlands was to take place the following day. Being prepared, Anton Philips and his son-in-law Frans Otten, as well as other Philips family members, fled to the United States taking a large amount of the company capital with them. Operating from the US as the North American Philips Company, they managed to run the company throughout the war. At the same time, the company was moved (on paper) to the Netherlands Antilles to keep it out of German hands.

On 6 December 1942, the British No. 2 Group RAF undertook Operation Oyster, which heavily damaged the Philips Radio factory in Eindhoven with few casualties among the Dutch workers and civilians. The Philips works in Eindhoven was bombed again by the RAF on 30 March 1943.

Frits Philips, the son of Anton, was the only Philips family member to stay in the Netherlands. He saved the lives of 382 Jews by convincing the Nazis that they were indispensable for the production process at Philips. In 1943, he was held at the internment camp for political prisoners at Vught for several months because a strike at his factory reduced production. For his actions in saving the hundreds of Jews, he was recognized by Yad Vashem in 1995 as a &quot;Righteous Among the Nations&quot;.

===Car audio===
Philips innovated in the production of car audio equipment for many vehicle manufacturers, including Audi, BMW, Opel, Peugeot, Renault, Vauxhall and Volkswagen.
In response to popular culture and consumer spending power, Philips focused on making its technologies accessible. The first Compact Cassette audio player - ideal for the mass market - was an instant success. It set the global standard for tape recording and was followed by the first stereo Compact Cassette player, as well as car and portable radio cassette players.

=== 1945–1999 ===
After the war, the company was moved back to the Netherlands, with their headquarters in Eindhoven.
In 1949, the company began selling television sets. In 1950, it formed Philips Records, which eventually formed part of PolyGram in 1962. Philips introduced the compact cassette audio tape format in 1963, and it was wildly successful. Cassettes were initially used for dictation machines for office typing stenographers and professional journalists. As their sound quality improved, cassettes would also be used to record sound and became the second mass media alongside vinyl records used to sell recorded music.
Philips introduced the first combination portable radio and cassette recorder, which was marketed as the &quot;radio recorder&quot;, and is now better known as the boombox. Later, the cassette was used in telephone answering machines, including a special form of cassette where the tape was wound on an endless loop. The C-cassette was used as the first mass storage device for early personal computers in the 1970s and 1980s. Philips reduced the cassette size for professional needs with the mini-cassette, although it was not as successful as the Olympus microcassette. The mini-cassette became the predominant dictation medium up to the advent of fully digital dictation machines. Philips continued with computers through the early 1990s (see separate article: Philips Computers).

In 1972, Philips launched the world&#x27;s first home videocassette recorder, in the UK, the N1500. Its relatively bulky video cassettes could record 30 minutes or 45 minutes. Later one-hour tapes were also offered. As the competition came from Sony&#x27;s Betamax and the VHS group of manufacturers, Philips introduced the N1700 system which allowed double-length recording. For the first time, a 2-hour movie could fit onto one video cassette. In 1977, the company unveiled a special promotional film for this system in the UK, featuring comedy writer and presenter Denis Norden. The concept was quickly copied by the Japanese makers, whose tapes were significantly cheaper. Philips made one last attempt at a new standard for video recorders with the Video 2000 system, with tapes that could be used on both sides and had 8 hours of total recording time. As Philips only sold its systems on the PAL standard and in Europe, and the Japanese makers sold globally, the scale advantages of the Japanese proved insurmountable and Philips withdrew the V2000 system and joined the VHS Coalition.
Philips had developed a LaserDisc early on for selling movies, but delayed its commercial launch for fear of cannibalizing its video recorder sales. Later Philips joined with MCA to launch the first commercial LaserDisc standard and players. In 1982, Philips teamed with Sony to launch the compact disc; this format evolved into the CD-R, CD-RW, DVD and later Blu-ray, which Philips launched with Sony in 1997 and 2006 respectively.
In 1984, the Dutch Philips Group bought out nearly a one-third share and took over the management of the German company Grundig. Also in 1984, Philips split off its activities on the field of photolithographic integrated circuit production equipment, the so-called wafer steppers, into a joint venture with ASM International, located in Veldhoven under the name ASML. Over the years, this new company has evolved into the world&#x27;s leading manufacturer of chip production machines at the expense of competitors like Nikon and Canon.

Philips partnered with Sony again later to develop a new &quot;interactive&quot; disc format called CD-i, described by them as a &quot;new way of interacting with a television set&quot;. Philips created the majority of CD-i compatible players. After low sales, Philips repositioned the format as a video game console, but it was soon discontinued after being heavily criticized amongst the gaming community.

In the 1980s, Philips&#x27;s profit margin dropped below 1 percent, and in 1990 the company lost more than US$2 billion (biggest corporate loss in Dutch history). Troubles for the company continued into the 1990s as its status as a leading electronics company was swiftly lost. In 1985, Philips was the largest founding investor in TSMC which was established as a joint venture between Philips, the Taiwan government and other private investors.

In 1990, the newly appointed CEO, Jan Timmer, decided to sell off all businesses that dealt with computers which meant the end of Philips Data Systems as well as other computer activities. In 1991, the businesses were acquired by Digital Equipment Corporation. In 1991, the company&#x27;s name was changed from N.V. Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken to Philips Electronics N.V. At the same time, North American Philips was formally dissolved, and a new corporate division was formed in the US with the name Philips Electronics North America Corp.

In 1997, the company officers decided to move the headquarters from Eindhoven to Amsterdam along with the corporate name change to Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V., the latter of which was finalized on 16 March 1998. In 1997, Philips introduced at CES and CeBIT the first large (42-inch) commercially available flat-panel TV, using Fujitsu plasma displays. In 1998, looking to spur innovation, Philips created an Emerging Businesses group for its Semiconductors unit, based in Silicon Valley. The group was designed to be an incubator where promising technologies and products could be developed.

=== 2000s ===
The move of the headquarters to Amsterdam was completed in 2001. Initially, the company was housed in the Rembrandt Tower. In 2002, it moved to the Breitner Tower. Philips Lighting, Philips Research, Philips Semiconductors (spun off as NXP in September 2006), and Philips Design, are still based in Eindhoven. Philips Healthcare is headquartered in both Best, Netherlands (near Eindhoven) and Andover, Massachusetts, (north of Boston).

In 2000, Philips bought Optiva Corporation, the maker of Sonicare electric toothbrushes. The company was renamed Philips Oral Healthcare and made a subsidiary of Philips DAP. In 2001, Philips acquired Agilent Technologies&#x27; Healthcare Solutions Group (HSG) for EUR 2 billion. Philips created a computer monitors joint venture with LG called LG.Philips Displays in 2001. In 2001, after growing the unit&#x27;s Emerging Businesses group to nearly $1 billion in revenue, Scott A. McGregor was named the new president and CEO of Philips Semiconductors. McGregor&#x27;s appointment completed the company&#x27;s shift to having dedicated CEOs for all five of the company&#x27;s product divisions, which would in turn leave the Board of Management to concentrate on issues confronting the Philips Group as a whole. In February 2001 Philips sold its remaining interest in battery manufacturing to its then partner Matsushita (which itself became Panasonic in 2008).
In 2004, Philips abandoned the slogan &quot;Let&#x27;s make things better&quot; in favor of a new one: &quot;Sense and Simplicity&quot;. In December 2005, Philips announced its intention to sell or demerge its semiconductor division. On 1 September 2006, it was announced in Berlin that the name of the new company formed by the division would be NXP Semiconductors. On 2 August 2006, Philips completed an agreement to sell a controlling 80.1% stake in NXP Semiconductors to a consortium of private equity investors consisting of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. (KKR), Silver Lake Partners and AlpInvest Partners. On 21 August 2006, Bain Capital and Apax Partners announced that they had signed definitive commitments to join the acquiring consortium, a process which was completed on 1 October 2006.

In 2006, Philips bought out the company Lifeline Systems headquartered in Framingham, Massachusetts, in a deal valued at $750 million, its biggest move yet to expand its consumer-health business (M). In August 2007, Philips acquired the company Ximis, Inc. headquartered in El Paso, Texas, for their Medical Informatics Division. In October 2007, it purchased a Moore Microprocessor Patent (MPP) Portfolio license from The TPL Group.

On 21 December 2007, Philips and Respironics, Inc. announced a definitive agreement pursuant to which Philips acquired all of the outstanding shares of Respironics for US$66 per share, or a total purchase price of approximately €3.6  billion (US$5.1 billion) in cash. On 21 February 2008, Philips completed the acquisition of VISICU in Baltimore, Maryland, through the merger of its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary into VISICU. As a result of that merger, VISICU has become an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Philips. VISICU was the creator of the eICU concept of the use of Telemedicine from a centralized facility to monitor and care for ICU patients.

The Philips physics laboratory was scaled down in the early 21st century, as the company ceased trying to be innovative in consumer electronics through fundamental research.

=== 2010s ===
In 2010, Philips introduced the Airfryer brand of convection oven at the IFA Berlin consumer electronics fair. Philips announced the sale of its Assembléon subsidiary which made pick-and-place machines for the electronics industry.

Philips made several acquisitions during 2011, announcing on 5 January 2011 that it had acquired Optimum Lighting, a manufacturer of LED based luminaires. In January 2011, Philips agreed to acquire the assets of Preethi, a leading India-based kitchen appliances company. On 27 June 2011, Philips acquired Sectra Mamea AB, the mammography division of Sectra AB.

Because net profit slumped 85 percent in Q3 2011, Philips announced a cut of 4,500 jobs to match part of an €800 million ($1.1 billion) cost-cutting scheme to boost profits and meet its financial target. In 2011, the company posted a loss of €1.3 billion, but earned a net profit in Q1 and Q2 2012, however the management wanted €1.1 billion cost-cutting which was an increase from €800 million and may cut another 2,200 jobs until end of 2014.
In March 2012, Philips announced its intention to sell, or demerge its television manufacturing operations to TPV Technology.

After two decades in decline, Philips went through a major restructuring, shifting its focus from electronics to healthcare. Particularly from 2011 when a new CEO was appointed, Frans van Houten. The new health and medical strategy have helped Philips to thrive again in the 2010s. On 5 December 2012, the antitrust regulators of the European Union fined Philips and several other major companies for fixing prices of TV cathode-ray tubes in two cartels lasting nearly a decade.

On 29 January 2013, it was announced that Philips had agreed to sell its audio and video operations to the Japan-based Funai Electric for €150 million, with the audio business planned to transfer to Funai in the latter half of 2013, and the video business in 2017. As part of the transaction, Funai was to pay a regular licensing fee to Philips for the use of the Philips brand. The purchase agreement was terminated by Philips in October because of breach of contract and the consumer electronics operations remained under Philips. Philips said it would seek damages for breach of contract in the US$200-million sale. In April 2016, the International Court of Arbitration ruled in favour of Philips, awarding compensation of €135 million in the process.

In April 2013, Philips announced a collaboration with Paradox Engineering for the realization and implementation of a &quot;pilot project&quot; on network-connected street-lighting management solutions. This project was endorsed by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC).

In 2013, Philips removed the word &quot;Electronics&quot; from its name – becoming Royal Philips N.V. On 13 November 2013, Philips unveiled its new brand line &quot;Innovation and You&quot; and a new design of its shield mark. The new brand positioning is cited by Philips to signify company&#x27;s evolution and emphasize that innovation is only meaningful if it is based on an understanding of people&#x27;s needs and desires. On 28 April 2014, Philips agreed to sell their Woox Innovations subsidiary (consumer electronics) to Gibson Brands for $US135 million. On 23 September 2014, Philips announced a plan to split the company into two, separating the lighting business from the healthcare and consumer lifestyle divisions. It moved to complete this in March 2015 to an investment group for $3.3 billion.

In February 2015, Philips acquired Volcano Corporation to strengthen its position in non-invasive surgery and imaging. In June 2016, Philips spun off its lighting division to focus on the healthcare division. In June 2017, Philips announced it would acquire US-based Spectranetics Corp, a manufacturer of devices to treat heart disease, for €1.9 billion (£1.68 billion) expanding its image-guided therapy business.

In May 2016, Philips&#x27; lighting division Philips Lighting went through a spin-off process, and became an independent public company named Philips Lighting N.V. In 2017, Philips launched Philips Ventures, with a health technology venture fund as its main focus. Philips Ventures invested in companies including Mytonomy (2017) and DEARhealth (2019). On 18 July 2017, Philips announced its acquisition of TomTec Imaging Systems GmbH.

In 2018, the independent Philips Lighting N.V. was renamed Signify N.V. However, it continues to produce and market Philips-branded products such as Philips Hue color-changing LED light bulbs.

=== 2020s ===

In 2021, Philips Domestic Appliances was purchased by Hillhouse Capital for $4.4 billion. The company, now known as Versuni, continues to sell small appliances under the Philips brand under license.

In 2022, Philips announced that Frans Van Houten, who had served as CEO for 12 years would be stepping down, after a key product recall cut the company&#x27;s market value by more than half over the previous year. He was to be replaced by Philips&#x27;s EVP and Chief Business Leader of Connected Care, Roy Jakobs, effective 15 October 2022. In 2023, the company announced that it would be cutting 6,000 jobs from the company worldwide over the next two years after reporting 1.6 billion euros in losses during the 2022 financial year. The cuts came in addition to a 4,000-person staff reduction announced in October 2022.

In August 2023, Exor N.V., the holding company owned by the Agnelli family, took a 15% stake in Philips. The transaction was worth roughly €2.6 billion. On 17 September 2024, Philips announced the introduction of the 160cm FDA approved version of its unique LumiGuide endovascular navigation wire. It also marked the 1000th patient treated with its breakthrough 3D device guidance technology.

Philips&#x27; Electronics North American headquarters is in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Philips Lighting has its corporate office in Somerset, New Jersey; with manufacturing plants in Danville, Kentucky; Salina, Kansas; Dallas and Paris, Texas; and distribution centers in Mountain Top, Pennsylvania; El Paso, Texas; Ontario, California; and Memphis, Tennessee. Philips Healthcare is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and operates a health-tech hub in Nashville with over 1,000 jobs. The North American sales organization is based in Bothell, Washington. There are also manufacturing facilities in Bothell, Washington; Baltimore, Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio; Foster City, California; Gainesville, Florida; Milpitas, California; and Reedsville, Pennsylvania.

In 2007, Philips entered into a definitive merger agreement with North American luminaires company Genlyte Group Incorporated, which provides the company with a leading position in the North American luminaires (also known as &quot;lighting fixtures&quot;), controls and related products for a wide variety of applications, including solid state lighting. The company also acquired Respironics, which was a significant gain for its healthcare sector. On 21 February 2008, Philips completed the acquisition of Baltimore-based VISICU. VISICU was the creator of the eICU concept of the use of Telemedicine from a centralized facility to monitor and care for ICU patients.

In April 2020, the United States Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) entered into a contract with Philips Respironics for 43,000 bundled Trilogy Evo Universal ventilator (EV300) hospital ventilators. This included the production and delivery of ventilators to the Strategic National Stockpile—about 156,000 by the end of August 2020 and 187,000 more by the end of 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in March 2020, in response to an international demand, Philips increased production of the ventilators fourfold within five months. Production lines were added in the United States with employees working around the clock in factories producing ventilators, in Western Pennsylvania and California, for example.

In March 2020, ProPublica published a series of articles on the Philips ventilator contract as negotiated by trade adviser Peter Navarro. In response to the ProPublica series, in August, the United States House of Representatives undertook a &quot;congressional investigation&quot; into the acquisition of the Philips ventilators. The lawmakers investigation found &quot;evidence of fraud, waste and abuse&quot;.—the deal negotiated by Navarro had resulted in an over-payment to Philips by the US government of &quot;hundreds of millions&quot;.

===South America===
====Brazil====
Philips do Brasil was founded in 1924 in Rio de Janeiro. In 1929, Philips began selling radio receivers. In the 1930s, Philips was making its light bulbs and radio receivers in Brazil. From 1939 to 1945, World War II forced Brazilian branch of Philips to sell bicycles, refrigerators and insecticides. After the war, Philips had a great industrial expansion in Brazil, and was among the first groups to establish in Manaus Free Zone. In the 1970s, Philips Records was a major player in Brazil recording industry. Now Philips do Brasil is one of the largest foreign-owned companies in Brazil. Philips uses the brand Walita for domestic appliances in Brazil.

====Color television====
Color television was introduced in South America by Cor Dillen (CFO, 1960–1968; CEO, 1981–1982), with continent-wide service in the early 1980s.

===Former operations===
Philips subsidiary manufactured pharmaceuticals for human and veterinary use and products for crop protection. Duphar was sold to Solvay in 1990. Since then Solvay sold off all divisions to other companies (crop protection to UniRoyal, now Chemtura, the veterinary division to Fort Dodge, a division of Wyeth, and the pharmaceutical division to Abbott Laboratories).

PolyGram, Philips&#x27; music television and movies division, was sold to Seagram in 1998 and merged into Universal Music Group. Philips Records continues to operate as record label of UMG, its name is licensed from its former parent. In 1980, Philips acquired Marantz, a company renowned for high-end audio and video products, based at Kanagawa, Japan. In 2002, Marantz Japan merged with Denon to form D&amp;M Holdings and Philips sold its remaining stake in D&amp;M Holdings in 2008.

Origin, now part of Atos Origin, is a former division of Philips. ASM Lithography is a spin-off from a division of Philips. Hollandse Signaalapparaten was a manufacturer of military electronics. The business was sold to Thomson-CSF in 1990 and is now Thales Nederland. NXP Semiconductors, formerly known as Philips Semiconductors, was sold a consortium of private equity investors in 2006. On 6 August 2010, NXP completed its IPO, with shares trading on NASDAQ.

Ignis, of Comerio, in the province of Varese, Italy, producing washing machines, dishwashers and microwave ovens, was one of the leading companies in the domestic appliance market, holding a 38% share in 1960. In 1970, 50% of the company&#x27;s capital was taken over by Philips, which acquired full control in 1972. Ignis was in those years, after Zanussi, the second largest domestic appliance manufacturer, and in 1973 its factories numbered over 10,000 employees only in Italy. With the transfer of ownership to the Dutch multinational, the corporate name of the company was changed, which became &quot;IRE SpA&quot; (&quot;Industrie Riunite Eurodomestici&quot;). Thereafter Philips used to sell major household appliances (whitegoods) under the name Philips. After selling the Major Domestic Appliances division to Whirlpool Corporation it changed from Philips Whirlpool to Whirlpool Philips and finally to just Whirlpool. Whirlpool bought a 53% stake in Philips&#x27; major appliance operations to form Whirlpool International. Whirlpool bought Philips&#x27; remaining interest in Whirlpool International in 1991.

Philips Cryogenics was split off in 1990 to form the Stirling Cryogenics BV, Netherlands. This company is still active in the development and manufacturing of Stirling cryocoolers and cryogenic cooling systems. North American Philips distributed AKG Acoustics products under the AKG of America, Philips Audio/Video, Norelco and AKG Acoustics Inc. branding until AKG set up its North American division in San Leandro, California, in 1985. (AKG&#x27;s North American division has since moved to Northridge, California.)

Polymer Vision was a Philips spin-off which manufactured a flexible e-ink display screen. The company was acquired by Taiwanese contract electronics manufacturer Wistron in 2009 and it was shut down in 2012, after repeated failed attempts to find a potential buyer.

==Sponsorships==

In 1913, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands, Philips founded (Philips Sports Club, now commonly known as PSV). The club is active in numerous sports but is now best known for its football team, PSV Eindhoven, and swimming team. Philips owns the naming rights to Philips Stadium in Eindhoven, which is the home ground of PSV Eindhoven.

Outside of the Netherlands, Philips sponsors and has sponsored numerous sports clubs, sports facilities and events. In November 2008, Philips renewed and extended its F1 partnership with AT&amp;T Williams. Philips owns the naming rights to the &quot;Philips Championship&quot;, the premier basketball league in Australia, traditionally known as the National Basketball League. From 1988 to 1993, Philips was the principal sponsor of the Australian rugby league team The Balmain Tigers and Indonesian football club side Persiba Balikpapan. From 1998 to 2000, Philips sponsored the Winston Cup No. 7 entry for Geoff Bodine Racing, later Ultra Motorsports, for drivers Geoff Bodine and Michael Waltrip. From 1999 to 2018, Philips held the naming rights to Philips Arena in Atlanta, home of the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association and former home of the defunct Atlanta Thrashers of the National Hockey League. In 2024, Philips became a sponsor for La Liga team FC Barcelona.

Outside of sports, Philips sponsored the international &quot;Philips Monsters of Rock festival&quot;.

== Respironics recall ==
In June 2021, Philips announced a voluntary recall of several of its Respironics ventilators, BiPAP, and CPAP machines due to potential health risks. Gradual degradation of foam in the devices, intended to reduce noise and vibrations during operation, could result in patients inhaling particulates or certain chemicals. The recall involved around 3 to 4 million machines which, in addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, contributed to a supply chain crisis impeding the availability of these devices to patients. Originally, Philips described the risks as potentially &quot;life-threatening&quot; but that there had been no reports of death as a result of the issues. Since then, the FDA has received 385 reports of death allegedly caused by the foam issue.

In 2023, ProPublica and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Philips had received thousands of patient reports and returned machines affected by the degrading foam as far back as 2010, and many of these reports were not disclosed to the FDA as Philips was legally obligated to do.

In October 2022, dozens of lawsuits against Philips related to the safety concerns were consolidated into one class-action lawsuit. Philips settled this lawsuit in September 2023 for at least $479 million. In January 2024, Philips agreed to halt the sale of any new sleep apnea devices in the US as part of an agreement with the FDA. As part of the deal, Philips would need to meet certain conditions in its US manufacturing plants, a process that Philips CEO Roy Jakobs said could take five to seven years.

== Environmental record ==

=== Planned obsolescence ===
Philips was a member of the 1925 Phoebus cartel along with Osram, Tungsram, Associated Electrical Industries, , Compagnie des Lampes, International General Electric, and the GE Overseas Group, holding shares in the Swiss corporation proportional to their lamp sales. The cartel lowered operational costs and worked to standardize the life expectancy of light bulbs at 1,000 hours (down from 2,500 hours), and raised prices without fear of competition. The cartel tested their bulbs and fined manufacturers for bulbs that lasted more than 1,000 hours.

===Green initiatives===
Philips also runs the EcoVision initiative, which commits to a number of environmentally positive improvements, focusing on energy efficiency. The company marks its &quot;green&quot; products with the Philips Green Logo, identifying them as products which have a significantly better environmental performance than their competitors or predecessors.

===L-Prize competition===
In 2011, Philips won a $10 million cash prize from the US Department of Energy for winning its L-Prize competition, to produce a high-efficiency, long operating life replacement for a standard 60-W incandescent lightbulb. The winning LED lightbulb, which was made available to consumers in April 2012, produces slightly more than 900 lumens at an input power of 10 W.

===Greenpeace ranking===
In Greenpeace&#x27;s 2012 Guide to Greener Electronics that ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability, climate and energy and how green their products are, Philips ranked 10th of 16 companies with a score of 3.8/10. The company was the top scorer in the Energy section due to its energy advocacy work calling upon the EU to adopt a 30% reduction for greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. It was also praised for its new products which are free from PVC plastic and BFRs. However, the guide criticized Philips&#x27; sourcing of fibres for paper, arguing it must develop a paper procurement policy which excludes suppliers involved in deforestation and illegal logging.

Philips has made progress since 2007 (when it was first ranked in the guide started in 2006), in particular by supporting the Individual Producer Responsibility principle meaning that the company is accepting the responsibility for the toxic impacts of its products on e-waste dumps around the world.

===Dubai Lamp===
In 2016 Philips introduced a series of LED lamps with an efficiency up to 200lm/W. The Dubai Lamp produces 600 lumens at an input power of 3 W.

<text>Perciformes (), also called the Acanthopteri, is an order or superorder of ray-finned fish in the clade Percomorpha. &quot;Perciformes&quot; means &quot;perch-like&quot;. Among the well-known members of this group are perches and darters (Percidae), and also sea basses and groupers (Serranidae).

== Taxonomy ==
Formerly, this group was thought to be even more diverse than it is thought to be now, containing about 41% of all bony fish (about 10,000 species) and about 160 families, which is the most of any order within the vertebrates. However, many of these other families have since been reclassified within their own orders within the clade Percomorpha, significantly reducing the size of the group. In contrast to this splitting, other groups formerly considered distinct, such as the Scorpaeniformes, are now classified in the Perciformes.

=== Evolution ===
The earliest fossil perciform is the extinct serranid &quot;Paleoserranus&quot; from the Early Paleocene of Mexico, but potential records of &quot;percoids&quot; are known from the Maastrichtian, including &quot;Eoserranus&quot;, &quot;Indiaichthys&quot;, and &quot;Prolates&quot;, although their exact taxonomic identity remains uncertain.

==Characteristics==

The dorsal and anal fins are divided into anterior spiny and posterior soft-rayed portions, which may be partially or completely separated. The pelvic fins usually have one spine and up to five soft rays, positioned unusually far forward under the chin or under the belly. Scales are usually ctenoid (rough to the touch), although sometimes they are cycloid (smooth to the touch) or otherwise modified.

==Classification==
Classification of this group is controversial. As traditionally defined before the introduction of cladistics, the Perciformes are almost certainly paraphyletic. Other orders that should possibly be included as suborders are the Scorpaeniformes, Tetraodontiformes, and Pleuronectiformes.
Of the presently recognized suborders, several may be paraphyletic, as well. These are grouped by suborder/superfamily, generally following the text &quot;Fishes of the World&quot;.

<text>Asimina is a genus of small trees or shrubs described as a genus in 1763. &quot;Asimina&quot; is the only temperate genus in the tropical and subtropical flowering plant family Annonaceae. &quot;Asimina&quot; have large, simple leaves and large fruit. It is native to eastern North America and collectively referred to as pawpaw. The genus includes the widespread common pawpaw &quot;Asimina triloba,&quot; which bears the largest edible fruit indigenous to the United States. Pawpaws are native to 26 states of the U.S. and to Ontario in Canada. The common pawpaw is a patch-forming (clonal) understory tree found in well-drained, deep, fertile bottomland and hilly upland habitat. Pawpaws are in the same plant family (Annonaceae) as the custard apple, cherimoya, sweetsop, soursop, and ylang-ylang; the genus is the only member of that family not confined to the tropics. Fossils date to the Cretaceous.

==Names==
The genus name &quot;Asimina&quot; was first described and named by Michel Adanson, a French naturalist of Scottish descent. The name is adapted from a Native American term of unknown origin, &quot;assimin,&quot; through the French colonial &quot;asiminier.&quot;

The common name (American) pawpaw, also spelled paw paw, paw-paw, and papaw, probably derives from the Spanish &quot;papaya&quot;, perhaps because of the superficial similarity of their fruits.

==Description==

Pawpaws are shrubs or small trees to tall. The northern, cold-tolerant common pawpaw (&quot;A. triloba&quot;) is deciduous, while the southern species are often evergreen.

The leaves are alternate, obovate, entire, long and broad.

The flowers of pawpaws are produced singly or in clusters of up to eight together; they are large, 4–6 cm across, perfect, with three sepals and six petals (three large outer petals, three smaller inner petals). The petal color varies from white to purple or red-brown.

The fruit of the common pawpaw is a large, edible berry, long and broad, weighing from , with numerous seeds; it is green when unripe, maturing to yellow or brown. It has a flavor somewhat similar to both banana and mango, varying significantly by cultivar, and has more protein than most fruits.

==Species and their distributions==
11 species and several natural interspecies hybrids are accepted.

== Ecology ==
The common pawpaw is native to shady, rich bottom lands, where it often forms a dense undergrowth in the forest, often appearing as a patch or thicket of individual, small, slender trees.

Pawpaw flowers are insect-pollinated, but fruit production is limited since few if any pollinators are attracted to the flower&#x27;s faint, or sometimes nonexistent scent. The flowers produce an odor similar to that of rotting meat to attract blowflies or carrion beetles for cross pollination. Other insects that are attracted to pawpaw plants include scavenging fruit flies, carrion flies and beetles. Because of difficult pollination, some believe the flowers are self-incompatible.

Pawpaw fruit may be eaten by foxes, opossums, squirrels, and raccoons. Pawpaw leaves and twigs are seldom consumed by rabbits or deer.

The leaves, twigs, and bark of the common pawpaw tree contain natural insecticides known as acetogenins.

Larvae of the zebra swallowtail butterfly feed exclusively on young leaves of the various pawpaw species, but never occur in great numbers on the plants.

The pawpaw is considered an evolutionary anachronism, where a now-extinct evolutionary partner, such as a Pleistocene megafauna species, formerly consumed the fruit and assisted in seed dispersal.

==Cultivation and uses==

Wild-collected fruits of the common pawpaw (&quot;A. triloba&quot;) have long been a favorite treat throughout the tree&#x27;s extensive native range in eastern North America. Pawpaws have never been widely cultivated for fruit, but interest in pawpaw cultivation has increased in recent decades. Fresh pawpaw fruits are commonly eaten raw; however, once ripe they store only a few days at room temperature and do not ship well unless frozen. Other methods of preservation include dehydration, production of jams or jellies, and pressure canning. The fruit pulp is also often used locally in baked dessert recipes, with pawpaw often substituted in many banana-based recipes.

The common pawpaw is of interest in ecological restoration plantings, since this tree grows well in wet soil and has a strong tendency to form well-rooted clonal thickets.

==History==
The earliest documentation of pawpaws is in the 1541 report of the Spanish de Soto expedition, who found Native Americans cultivating it east of the Mississippi River. Chilled pawpaw fruit was a favorite dessert of George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson planted it at his home in Virginia, Monticello. The Lewis and Clark Expedition sometimes subsisted on pawpaws during their travels. Daniel Boone was also a consumer and fan of the pawpaw. The common pawpaw was designated as the Ohio state native fruit in 2009. Numerous pawpaw festivals have celebrated the plant and its fruit.
