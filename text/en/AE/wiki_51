<text>Nawaf Muhammad Salim al-Hazmi (; 9 August 1976 – 11 September 2001) was a Saudi terrorist hijacker who was one of five hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77, which they crashed into the Pentagon as part of the September 11 attacks.

Al-Hazmi and a long-time friend, Khalid al-Mihdhar, left their homes in Saudi Arabia in 1995 to fight for Muslims in the Bosnian War. Al-Hazmi later traveled to Afghanistan to fight with the Taliban against the Afghan Northern Alliance. He returned to Saudi Arabia in early 1999.

Already long-time affiliates of al-Qaeda with extensive fighting experience, al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar were chosen by Osama bin Laden for an ambitious terrorist plot to pilot commercial airliners into designated targets in the United States. Al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar both obtained US tourist visas in April 1999. Al-Hazmi trained in an al-Qaeda training camp in the fall of 1999 and traveled to Malaysia for the 2000 Al-Qaeda Summit.

Al-Hazmi arrived in Los Angeles, California, from Bangkok, Thailand, on 15 January 2000, alongside al-Mihdhar. The two settled in San Diego, staying at the Parkwood Apartments until May 2000. While in San Diego, they attended its mosque, led by Anwar al-Awlaki. The two took flying lessons in San Diego, but due to their poor English skills they did not perform well during their flight lessons and their flight instructor regarded them as suspicious.

Al-Mihdhar left al-Hazmi in California for Yemen in June 2000. Al-Hazmi stayed in California until he met up with Hani Hanjour in December 2000, and they both traveled to Phoenix, Arizona. They later moved to Falls Church, Virginia, in April 2001, where the rest of the hijackers began to join them. Al-Hazmi met frequently with Mohamed Atta, the ringleader of the attacks, during the summer of 2001.

The CIA reportedly received al-Hazmi&#x27;s name on a list of 19 persons suspected of planning an attack in the near future. Al-Hazmi was one of the four names on the list who were known for certain. A search for al-Hazmi and other suspected terrorists commenced, but they were not located until after the attacks.

The day before the September 11 attacks, al-Hazmi, al-Mihdhar, and Hanjour checked into a hotel in Herndon, Virginia. The next morning, al-Hazmi and four other terrorists, including al-Hazmi&#x27;s younger brother, Salem al-Hazmi, boarded American Airlines Flight 77 at Dulles International Airport and hijacked the plane so that Hanjour could pilot and crash the plane into the Pentagon as part of the 11 September attacks. The crash killed all 64 passengers aboard the aircraft and 125 in the Pentagon. Following the attacks, al-Hazmi&#x27;s participation was initially dismissed as that of a &quot;muscle hijacker&quot;, but he was later revealed to have played a larger role in the operational planning than previously believed.

==Early life and activities==
Nawaf al-Hazmi was born in Mecca in Saudi Arabia to Muhammad Salim al-Hazmi, a grocer. He traveled to Afghanistan as a teenager in 1993. CNN&#x27;s preliminary report following the attacks claimed that an unnamed acquaintance relayed &#x27;&quot;He told me once that his father had tried to kill him when he was a child. He never told me why, but he had a long knife scar on his forearm&quot;, and claimed that his older brother was a police chief in Jizan.

In 1995, he and his childhood friend, Khalid al-Mihdhar, joined a group that went to fight alongside Bosnian Muslims in the Bosnian War. Afterwards, Nawaf al-Hazmi returned to Afghanistan along with his brother Salem, and al-Mihdhar. In Afghanistan, they fought alongside the Taliban against the Afghan Northern Alliance, and joined up with al-Qaeda. Al-Hazmi returned to Saudi Arabia in early 1999.

==Selected for the 9/11 plot==
Osama bin Laden held al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar in high respect, with their experience fighting during the 1990s in Bosnia and elsewhere. Al-Qaeda later referred to al-Hazmi as al-Mihdhar&#x27;s &quot;Second-in-command&quot;. When bin Laden committed to the &quot;planes operation&quot; plot in spring 1999, he personally selected al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar to be involved in the plot as pilot hijackers. In addition to al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar, two Yemenis were selected for a southeast Asia component of the plot, which was later scrapped for being too difficult to coordinate with the operations in the United States. Known as &quot;Rabi&#x27;ah al-Makki&quot; during the preparations, al-Hazmi had been so eager to participate in operations within the United States, he already had a US visa when bin Laden selected him. Al-Hazmi obtained a B-1/B-2 tourist visa on April 3, 1999, from the US consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, using a new passport he acquired a few weeks earlier. Al-Hazmi&#x27;s passport did have indicators of al-Qaeda association, but immigration inspectors were not trained to look for those.

In the autumn of 1999, these four attended the Mes Aynak training camp in Afghanistan, which provided advanced training. Al-Hazmi went with the two Yemenis, Tawfiq bin Attash (Khallad) and Abu Bara al Yemeni, to Karachi, Pakistan, where Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the plot&#x27;s coordinator, instructed him on western culture, travel, as well as taught some basic English phrases. Al-Mihdhar did not go with him to Karachi, but instead left for Yemen. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed then sent al-Hazmi and the other men to Malaysia for a meeting. Before leaving for Malaysia, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed doctored al-Hazmi&#x27;s Saudi passport in order to conceal his travel to Pakistan and Afghanistan, and make it appear that al-Hazmi had come to Malaysia from Saudi Arabia via Dubai.

After the attacks, the Associated Press would re-publish a &quot;bizarre&quot; story by the &quot;Cody Enterprise&quot; that quoted witnesses stating that al-Hazmi entered the United States during the autumn of 1999, crossing along the Canada–US border as one of two men delivering skylights to the local high school in Cody, Wyoming. Leaving the city 45 minutes later with the remaining cardboard boxes, the men allegedly asked &quot;how to get to Florida&quot;.

===Malaysia summit===

Based on information uncovered by the FBI in the 1998 United States embassy bombings case, the National Security Agency (NSA) began tracking the communications of al-Mihdhar&#x27;s father-in-law, Ahmad Muhammad Ali al-Hada, who was facilitating al-Qaeda communications, in 1999. Authorities also became aware of al-Hazmi, as a friend and associate of al-Mihdhar. Saudi Intelligence was also aware that Hazmi was associated with al-Qaeda, and associated with the 1998 African embassy bombings and attempts to smuggle arms into the kingdom in 1997. He also said that he revealed this to the CIA, saying &quot;What we told them was these people were on our watch list from previous activities of al-Qaeda&quot; The CIA strongly denies having received any such warning.

In late 1999, the NSA informed the CIA of an upcoming meeting in Malaysia, which al-Hada mentioned would involve &quot;Khalid&quot;, &quot;Nawaf&quot;, and &quot;Salem&quot;. On January 5, al-Hazmi arrived in Kuala Lumpur, where he met up with al-Mihdhar, bin Attash, and Abu Bara. The group was in Malaysia to meet with Hambali for the 2000 Al Qaeda Summit, during which key details of the attacks may have been arranged. At this time, there was an East Asia component to the September 11 attacks plot, but bin Laden later canceled it for being too difficult to coordinate with operations in the United States. Ramzi bin al-Shibh was also at the summit, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed possibly attended the summit. In Malaysia, the group stayed with Yazid Sufaat, a local member of Jemaah Islamiyah, who provided accommodations at request of Hambali. Both al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi were secretly photographed at the meeting by Malaysian authorities, who provided surveillance at the request of the CIA. Malaysian authorities reported that al-Mihdhar spoke at length with Tawfiq bin Attash, one of the Yemenis, and others who were later involved in the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing. Al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar also met with Fahd al-Quso, who was later involved in the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing. After the meeting, al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi traveled to Bangkok in Thailand on January 8, and left a week later on January 15 to travel to the United States.

==In the United States==

===Enters the United States with Mihdhar===

On 15 January 2000, al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar arrived together at Los Angeles International Airport from Bangkok, and were admitted for a six-month period. On February 1, 2000—17 days upon entering the United States—the two men encountered Omar al-Bayoumi and Caysan Bin Don at a halal food restaurant on Venice Boulevard in Culver City. Al-Bayoumi claims he was merely being charitable in helping the two seemingly out-of-place Muslims to move to San Diego where he helped them find an apartment near his own, co-signed their lease, and gave them $1,500 to help pay their rent. FBI documents declassified in 2022 demonstrate that al-Bayoumi was an agent of Saudi intelligence, with the FBI concluding that there was a &quot;50/50 chance&quot; that he (and thus the Saudi government) had foreknowledge of the attacks.

In the beginning of February 2000, al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi rented an apartment at the Parkwood Apartments, a 175-unit complex in the Clairemont Mesa section of San Diego, near the Balboa Drive Mosque. In February, al-Mihdhar purchased a used 1988 Toyota Corolla. While living at the Parkwood Apartments, neighbors thought that al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi were odd. Months passed without them getting any furniture for the apartment. Instead, the men slept on mattresses on the floor, yet they carried briefcases, were frequently on their mobile phones, and were occasionally picked up by a limousine. After the attacks, their neighbors told the media that the pair constantly played flight simulator games. Authorities say the two regularly attended the Masjid Ar-Ribat al-Islami mosque that Anwar Al-Awlaki led as the imam in San Diego, having many closed-door meetings with the imam, although Al-Awlaki told authorities their conversations were trivial in nature. While in San Diego, witnesses told the FBI he and al-Mindhar had a close relationship with Anwar Al-Awlaki. Al-Hazmi got a part-time job through the mosque at a nearby car wash.
On 4 April 2000, al-Hazmi took a one-hour introductory flight lesson at the National Air College in San Diego. Both al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi took flight lessons in May 2000 at the Sorbi Flying Club, located at Montgomery Field in San Diego. On May 5, al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar took a lesson for one hour, and additional lessons on May 10 at the Sorbi Flying Club, with al-Hazmi flying an aircraft for 30 minutes. However, their English skills were very poor, and they did not do well with flight lessons. The first day that they showed up, they told instructors that they wanted to learn how to fly Boeings. Al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi raised some suspicion when they offered extra money to their flight instructor, Richard Garza, if he would train them to fly jets. Suspicious of the two men, Garza refused the offer but did not report them to authorities. Garza described the two men as &quot;impatient students&quot; who &quot;wanted to learn to fly jets, specifically Boeings.&quot;

Adel Rafeea received a wire transfer of $5,000, on April 18, from Ali Abdul Aziz Ali in the UAE, which he later claimed was money al-Hazmi had asked him to accept on his behalf.

At the end of May 2000, al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar moved out of Parkwood Apartments, and moved to nearby Lemon Grove, California. Two days later—on June 2—al-Mihdhar transferred his vehicle&#x27;s registration to al-Hazmi, and departed the U.S. for Frankfurt, Germany on 10 June 2000. Al-Mihdhar returned to Yemen, which angered Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who did not want al-Hazmi to be left alone in California.

On 12 July 2000, al-Hazmi filed for an extension of his visa, which was due to expire. His visa was extended until January 2001, though al-Hazmi never filed any further requests to extend it beyond that.

In September, al-Hamzi and al-Mihdhar both moved into the house of FBI informant Abdussattar Shaikh, although he did not report the pair as suspicious. Al-Mihdhar is believed to have left the apartment in early October, less than two weeks before the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing. Al-Hazmi continued living with Shaikh until December.

Hani Hanjour arrived in San Diego in early December 2000, where he joined al-Hazmi, but on December 10 they were seen leaving their Mount Vernon address. The two men traveled to Phoenix, Arizona, where Hanjour could take refresher flight training classes. On 12 December, they arrived at Mesa, Arizona. On December 22, Hanjour and al-Hazmi signed a lease for an apartment in the Indian Springs Village complex in Mesa, moving in on January 9, 2001.

===2001===

In March, al-Hazmi received a shipment of VHS videos including videos about Boeing 747 and 777 flight decks and &quot;how an airline captain should look and act&quot; and later a road atlas, map of New York City and a World aeronautical chart.

On 30 March, al-Hazmi notified his utility company that he might be moving to another state or Saudi Arabia. He and Hanjour moved out before the apartment rental expired at the end of the month on their way to Virginia. Two days later on 1 April 2001, Oklahoma police officer C. L. Parkins pulled al-Hazmi over for speeding in their Corolla along with an additional citation for failing to use a seatbelt together totaling $138. A routine inspection of his California drivers license turned up no warrants or alerts, although his name was known to both the NSA and the CIA as a suspected terrorist.

Anwar al-Awlaki had already headed east and served as Imam at the Dar al-Hijrah mosque in the metropolitan Washington, DC area starting in January 2001. Shortly after this, his sermons were attended by three of the 9/11 hijackers (the new one being Hanjour).

By 3 April, he was likely with companion Hani Hanjour when he was recorded at an ATM in Front Royal, Virginia, arriving in Falls Church, Virginia, by April 4. They met a man believed to be a Jordanian named Eyad Alrababah at a 7-11 that day. The 9/11 Commission wrote that al-Hazmi and Hanjour met Alrababah at the Dar al Hijra mosque who was a computer technician who had moved from West Paterson, New Jersey and was there to ask imam Anwar al-Awlaki about finding a job. He helped the pair rent an apartment in Alexandria where they moved in.

The 9/11 Commission concluded that two of the hijackers &quot;reportedly respected al-Awlaki as a religious figure&quot;. Police found his telephone number in the contacts of Ramzi bin al-Shibh (the &quot;20th hijacker&quot;) when they searched his Hamburg apartment while investigating the 9/11 attacks.

On 1 May 2001, al-Hazmi reported to police that a man tried to take his wallet outside his Fairfax, Virginia, residence, but before the county officer left, al-Hazmi signed a &quot;statement of release&quot; indicating he did not want the incident investigated.

The day after, on 2 May, two other hijackers, Ahmed al-Ghamdi and Majed Moqed, arrived in Virginia and moved in with them. On 8 May, Alrababah suggested that al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar move with him to Fairfield, Connecticut, and helped all four hijackers move to a hotel there. They called area flight schools and after a few days Alrababah drove the four to Paterson, New Jersey, to show them around. Some FBI agents suspected that al-Awlaki gave Alrababah the job of helping al-Hazmi and Hanjour. Alrababah was later arrested as a witness convicted after 9/11 in a fraudulent driver&#x27;s license scheme and deported to Jordan.

On 21 May, al-Hazmi moved in with Hanjour into an apartment in Paterson New Jersey. Mohamed Atta was living in the same city at another location.

On 30 June, al-Hazmi&#x27;s car was involved in a minor traffic accident on the east-bound George Washington Bridge. On June 25, 2001, al-Hazmi obtained a drivers&#x27; license in Florida, providing an address in Delray Beach, Florida, and he obtained a USA ID card on 10 July. On 2 August, al-Hazmi also obtained a Virginia drivers&#x27; license, and made a request for it to be reissued on 7 September.

On 20 July, al-Hazmi and fellow hijacker Hani Hanjour flew to the Montgomery County Airpark in Maryland from on a practice flight from Fairfield, New Jersey.

Al-Hazmi, along with at least five other future hijackers, traveled to Las Vegas, Nevada, at least six times in the summer of 2001. They reportedly drank alcohol, gambled, and paid strippers to perform lap dances for them.

Throughout the summer, al-Hazmi met with leader Mohamed Atta to discuss the status of the operation of a monthly basis.

On 23 August, Israeli Mossad reportedly gave his name to the CIA as one of 19 belonging to US residents who they said were planning to attack the United States in the near future. Only four of the names are known for certain, the other three belonging to fellow 9/11 hijackers Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, and Khalid al-Mihdhar, but it is not known if all 19 of the 9/11 hijackers&#x27; names were on the list or if the list had 19 names by sheer coincidence. Regardless, the connection was not made with previous contacts by local law enforcement. On the same day, he was added to an INS watch list, along with al-Mihdhar, to prevent entry into the US.

An internal review after 9/11 found that &quot;everything was done [to find them] that could have been done.&quot; However, the search does not appear to have been particularly aggressive. A national motor vehicle index was reportedly checked, but al-Hazmi&#x27;s speeding ticket was not detected for some reason. The FBI did not search credit card databases, bank account databases, or car registration, all of which would have produced positive results. Al-Hazmi was even listed in the 2000–2001 San Diego phone book, but this too was not searched until after the attacks.
He had not been placed on terrorist watch lists, nor did the CIA or NSA alert the FBI, Customs and Immigration, or local police and enforcement agencies.

On 27 August, brothers Nawaf and Salem Al-Hazmi purchased flight tickets through Travelocity.com using Nawaf&#x27;s Visa card.

On 1 September, Nawaf Al-Hazmi registered Room #7 at the Pin-Del Motel in Laurel, Maryland. On the registration, he listed his driver&#x27;s license number as 3402142-D, and gave a New York hotel as his permanent residence. Ziad Jarrah had checked into the hotel on 27 August.

Al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar purchased their 9/11 plane tickets online using a credit card with their real names. This raised no red flags, since the FAA had not been informed that the two were on a terrorist watchlist.

==Attacks==
On 10 September, the day before the September 11 attacks, Hanjour, al-Mihdhar, and al-Hazmi checked into the Marriott Residence Inn in Herndon, Virginia, where Saleh Ibn Abdul Rahman Hussayen, a prominent Saudi government official, was staying – although no evidence was ever uncovered that they had met, or knew of each other&#x27;s presence.

On the morning of 11 September, al-Hazmi boarded American Airlines Flight 77. The flight was scheduled to depart at 08:10 but ended up departing 10 minutes late from Gate D26 at Dulles. The last normal radio communications from the aircraft to air traffic control occurred at 08:50:51. At 08:54, the hijackers sent pilots Charles Burlingame and David Charlesbois to the back of the plane. Flight 77 began to deviate from its normal, assigned flight path and turned south. The hijackers then set the flight&#x27;s autopilot in the direction of Washington, D.C. Passenger Barbara Olson called her husband, United States Solicitor General Theodore Olson, and reported that the plane had been hijacked and that the assailants had box cutters and knives. At 09:37, American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the west facade of the Pentagon, killing all 64 aboard (including the hijackers) along with 125 in the Pentagon.

==Aftermath==
Nawaf al-Hazmi&#x27;s 1988 blue Toyota Corolla was found on the next day in Dulles International Airport&#x27;s hourly parking lot. Inside the vehicle, authorities found a letter written by Mohamed Atta, maps of Washington, D.C. and New York City, a cashier&#x27;s check made out to a Phoenix flight school, four drawings of a Boeing 757 cockpit, a box cutter, and a page with notes and phone numbers.

In the recovery process at the Pentagon, remains of all five Flight 77 hijackers were identified through a process of elimination, as not matching any DNA samples for the victims, and put into custody of the FBI. Forensics teams confirmed that it seemed two of the hijackers were brothers, based on their DNA similarities.

Several weeks after the attacks, a Las Vegas Days Inn employee went to the FBI and stated that she recognized al-Hazmi&#x27;s photographs from the media as being a man she had met at the hotel, who had asked for details on hotels near Los Angeles. She admitted that he never gave his name.

==Timeline in America==
Late in 2005, Army Lt. Col. Kevin Shaffer and Congressman Curt Weldon alleged that the Defense Department data mining project Able Danger had kept Nawaf al-Hazmi, Khalid al-Mihdhar, Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi all under surveillance as al-Qaeda agents.

<doc id="21632" wikidata="Q1413" url="?curid=21632" title="Nero">
<text>Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus ( ; born Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus; 15 December AD 37 – 9 June AD 68) was a Roman emperor and the final emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, reigning from AD 54 until his death in AD 68.

Nero was born at Antium in AD 37, the son of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Agrippina the Younger (great-granddaughter of the emperor Augustus). Nero was three when his father died. By the time Nero turned eleven, his mother married Emperor Claudius, who then adopted Nero as his heir. Upon Claudius&#x27; death in AD 54, Nero ascended to the throne with the backing of the Praetorian Guard and the Senate. In the early years of his reign, Nero was advised and guided by his mother Agrippina, his tutor Seneca the Younger, and his praetorian prefect Sextus Afranius Burrus, but sought to rule independently and rid himself of restraining influences. The power struggle between Nero and his mother reached its climax when he orchestrated her murder. Roman sources also implicate Nero in the deaths of both his wife Claudia Octavia – supposedly so he could marry Poppaea Sabina – and his stepbrother Britannicus.

Nero&#x27;s practical contributions to Rome&#x27;s governance focused on diplomacy, trade, and culture. He ordered the construction of amphitheaters, and promoted athletic games and contests. He made public appearances as an actor, poet, musician, and charioteer, which scandalized his aristocratic contemporaries as these occupations were usually the domain of slaves, public entertainers, and infamous persons. However, the provision of such entertainments made Nero popular among lower-class citizens. The costs involved were borne by local elites either directly or through taxation, and were much resented by the Roman aristocracy.

During Nero&#x27;s reign, the general Corbulo fought the Roman–Parthian War of 58–63, and made peace with the hostile Parthian Empire. The Roman general Suetonius Paulinus quashed a major revolt in Britain led by queen Boudica. The Bosporan Kingdom was briefly annexed to the empire, and the First Jewish–Roman War began. When the Roman senator Vindex rebelled, with support from the eventual Roman emperor Galba, Nero was declared a public enemy and condemned to death &quot;in absentia&quot;. He fled Rome, and on 9 June AD 68 committed suicide. His death sparked a brief period of civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors.

Most Roman sources offer overwhelmingly negative assessments of his personality and reign. Most contemporary sources describe him as tyrannical, self-indulgent, and debauched. The historian Tacitus claims the Roman people thought him compulsive and corrupt. Suetonius tells that many Romans believed the Great Fire of Rome was instigated by Nero to clear land for his planned &quot;Golden House&quot;. Tacitus claims Nero seized Christians as scapegoats for the fire and had them burned alive, seemingly motivated not by public justice, but personal cruelty. Some modern historians question the reliability of ancient sources on Nero&#x27;s tyrannical acts, considering his popularity among the Roman commoners. In the eastern provinces of the Empire, a popular legend arose that Nero had not died and would return. After his death, at least three leaders of short-lived, failed rebellions presented themselves as &quot;Nero reborn&quot; to gain popular support.

==Early life==
Nero was born Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus on 15 December AD 37 in Antium (modern Anzio), eight months after the death of Tiberius. He was an only-child, the son of the politician Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Agrippina the Younger. His mother Agrippina was the sister of the third Roman emperor Caligula. Nero was also the great-great-grandson of former emperor Augustus (descended from Augustus&#x27; only daughter, Julia).
The ancient biographer Suetonius, who was critical of Nero&#x27;s ancestors, wrote that emperor Augustus had reproached Nero&#x27;s grandfather for his unseemly enjoyment of violent gladiator games. According to Jürgen Malitz, Suetonius tells that Nero&#x27;s father was known to be &quot;irascible and brutal&quot;, and that both &quot;enjoyed chariot races and theater performances to a degree not befitting their position&quot;. Suetonius also mentions that when Nero&#x27;s father Domitius was congratulated by his friends for the birth of his son, he replied that any child born to him and Agrippina would have a detestable nature and become a public danger.

Domitius died in AD 41. A few years before his father&#x27;s death, his father was involved in a serious political scandal. His mother and his two surviving sisters, Agrippina and Julia Livilla, were exiled to a remote island in the Mediterranean Sea. His mother was said to have been exiled for plotting to overthrow the emperor Caligula. Nero&#x27;s inheritance was taken from him, and he was sent to live with his paternal aunt Domitia Lepida, the mother of later emperor Claudius&#x27;s third wife, Messalina.

After Caligula&#x27;s death, Claudius became the new emperor. Nero&#x27;s mother married Claudius in AD 49, becoming his fourth wife. On 25 February AD 50, Claudius was pressured to adopt Nero as his son, giving him the new name of &quot;Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus&quot;. Claudius had gold coins issued to mark the adoption. Classics professor Josiah Osgood has written that &quot;the coins, through their distribution and imagery alike, showed that a new Leader was in the making.&quot; However, David Shotter noted that, despite events in Rome, Nero&#x27;s step-brother Britannicus was more prominent in provincial coinages during the early 50s.

Nero formally entered public life as an adult in AD 51 while 13 years old. When he turned 16, Nero married Claudius&#x27; daughter (his step-sister), Claudia Octavia. Between the years AD 51 and AD 53, he gave several speeches on behalf of various communities, including the Ilians; the Apameans (requesting a five-year tax reprieve after an earthquake); and the northern colony of Bologna, after their settlement had suffered a devastating fire.

Claudius died in AD 54; many ancient historians claim that he was poisoned by Agrippina. Shotter has written that &quot;Claudius&#x27; death...has usually been regarded as an event hastened by Agrippina, due to signs that Claudius was showing a renewed affection for his natural son.&quot; He notes that among ancient sources, the Roman historian Josephus was uniquely reserved in describing the poisoning as a rumor. Contemporary sources differ in their accounts of the poisoning. Tacitus says that the poison-maker Locusta prepared the toxin, which was served to the Emperor by his servant Halotus. Tacitus also writes that Agrippina arranged for Claudius&#x27; doctor Xenophon to administer poison, in the event that the Emperor survived. Suetonius differs in some details, but also implicates Halotus and Agrippina. Like Tacitus, Cassius Dio writes that the poison was prepared by Locusta, but in Dio&#x27;s account it is administered by Agrippina instead of Halotus. In &quot;Apocolocyntosis&quot;, Seneca the Younger does not mention mushrooms at all. Agrippina&#x27;s involvement in Claudius&#x27; death is not accepted by all modern scholars.

Before Claudius&#x27; death, Agrippina had maneuvered to remove Claudius&#x27; sons&#x27; tutors in order to replace them with tutors that she had selected. She was also able to convince Claudius to replace two prefects of the Praetorian Guard (who were suspected of supporting Claudius&#x27; son) with Afranius Burrus (Nero&#x27;s future guide). Since Agrippina had replaced the guard officers with men loyal to her, Nero was subsequently able to assume power without incident.

==Reign (AD 54–68)==
The main ancient Roman literary sources for Nero&#x27;s reign are Tacitus, Suetonius and Cassius Dio. They found Nero&#x27;s construction projects overly extravagant and claim that their cost left Italy &quot;thoroughly exhausted by contributions of money&quot; with &quot;the provinces ruined&quot;. Modern historians note that the period was riddled with deflation and that Nero intended his spending on public-work and charities to ease economic troubles.

===Early reign===
Nero became emperor in AD 54, aged 16. His tutor, Seneca, prepared Nero&#x27;s first speech before the Senate. During this speech, Nero spoke about &quot;eliminating the ills of the previous regime&quot;. H. H. Scullard writes that &quot;he promised to follow the Augustan model in his principate, to end all secret trials &quot;intra cubiculum&quot;, to have done with the corruption of court favorites and freedmen, and above all to respect the privileges of the Senate and individual Senators.&quot; His respect for Senatorial autonomy, which distinguished him from Caligula and Claudius, was generally well received by the Roman Senate.

Scullard writes that Nero&#x27;s mother, Agrippina, &quot;meant to rule through her son&quot;. Agrippina murdered her political rivals: Domitia Lepida the Younger, the aunt that Nero had lived with during Agrippina&#x27;s exile; Marcus Junius Silanus, a great-grandson of Augustus; and Narcissus. One of the earliest coins that Nero issued during his reign shows Agrippina on the coin&#x27;s obverse side; usually, this would be reserved for a portrait of the emperor. The Senate also allowed Agrippina two lictors during public appearances, an honor that was customarily bestowed upon only magistrates and the Vestalis Maxima. In AD 55, Nero removed Agrippina&#x27;s ally Marcus Antonius Pallas from his position in the treasury. Shotter writes the following about Agrippina&#x27;s deteriorating relationship with Nero: &quot;What Seneca and Burrus probably saw as relatively harmless in Nero—his cultural pursuits and his affair with the slave girl Claudia Acte—were to her signs of her son&#x27;s dangerous emancipation of himself from her influence.&quot; Britannicus was poisoned after Agrippina threatened to side with him. Nero, who was having an affair with Acte, exiled Agrippina from the palace when she began to cultivate a relationship with his wife Octavia.
Jürgen Malitz writes that ancient sources do not provide any clear evidence to evaluate the extent of Nero&#x27;s personal involvement in politics during the first years of his reign. He describes the policies that are explicitly attributed to Nero as &quot;well-meant but incompetent notions&quot; like Nero&#x27;s failed initiative to abolish all taxes in AD 58. Scholars generally credit Nero&#x27;s advisors Burrus and Seneca with the administrative successes of these years. Malitz writes that in later years, Nero panicked when he had to make decisions on his own during times of crisis.

Nevertheless, his early administration ruled to great acclaim. A generation later those years were seen in retrospect as an exemplar of good and moderate government and described as &quot;Quinquennium Neronis&quot; by Trajan. Especially well received were fiscal reforms which among others put tax collectors under more strict control by establishing local offices to supervise their activities. After the affair of Lucius Pedanius Secundus, who was murdered by a desperate slave, Nero allowed slaves to file complaints about their treatment to the authorities.

===Residences===
Outside of Rome, Nero had several villas or palaces built, the ruins of which can still be seen today. These included the Villa of Nero at Antium, his place of birth, where he razed the villa on the site to rebuild it on a more massive and imperial scale and including a theatre. At Subiaco, Lazio, near Rome he had 3 artificial lakes built, with waterfalls, bridges and walkways for the luxurious villa. He stayed at the Villa of Nero at Olympia, Greece, during his participation at the Olympic Games of AD 67.

===Matricide===
According to Suetonius, Nero had his former freedman Anicetus arrange a shipwreck, which Agrippina managed to survive. She then swam ashore and was executed by Anicetus, who reported her death as a suicide. &quot;The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome&quot; cautiously notes that Nero&#x27;s reasons for killing his mother in AD 59 are &quot;not fully understood&quot;. According to Tacitus, the source of conflict between Nero and his mother was Nero&#x27;s affair with Poppaea Sabina. In &quot;Histories&quot; Tacitus writes that the affair began while Poppaea was still married to Rufrius Crispinus, but in his later work &quot;Annals&quot; Tacitus says Poppaea was married to Otho when the affair began. In &quot;Annals&quot; Tacitus writes that Agrippina opposed Nero&#x27;s affair with Poppaea because of her affection for his wife Octavia. Anthony A. Barrett writes that Tacitus&#x27; account in &quot;Annals&quot; &quot;suggests that Poppaea&#x27;s challenge drove [Nero] over the brink&quot;. A number of modern historians have noted that Agrippina&#x27;s death would not have offered much advantage for Poppaea, as Nero did not marry Poppaea until AD 62. Barrett writes that Poppaea seems to serve as a &quot;literary device, utilized [by Tacitus] because [he] could see no plausible explanation for Nero&#x27;s conduct and also incidentally [served] to show that Nero, like Claudius, had fallen under the malign influence of a woman.&quot;

===Decline===
Modern scholars believe that Nero&#x27;s reign had been going well in the years before Agrippina&#x27;s death. For example, Nero promoted the exploration of the Nile river sources with a successful expedition. After Agrippina&#x27;s exile, Burrus and Seneca were responsible for the administration of the Empire. However, Nero&#x27;s &quot;conduct became far more egregious&quot; after his mother&#x27;s death. Miriam T. Griffin suggests that Nero&#x27;s decline began as early as AD 55 with the murder of his stepbrother Britannicus, but also notes that &quot;Nero lost all sense of right and wrong and listened to flattery with total credulity&quot; after Agrippina&#x27;s death. Griffin points out that Tacitus &quot;makes explicit the significance of Agrippina&#x27;s removal for Nero&#x27;s conduct&quot;.

He began to build a new palace, the Domus Transitoria, from about AD 60. It was intended to connect all of the imperial estates that had been acquired in various ways, linking the Palatine with the Gardens of Maecenas, Horti Lamiani, Horti Lolliani, etc.

In AD 62, Nero&#x27;s adviser Burrus died. That same year, Nero called for the first treason trial of his reign (&quot;maiestas&quot; trial) against Antistius Sosianus. He also executed his rivals Cornelius Sulla and Rubellius Plautus. Jürgen Malitz considers this to be a turning point in Nero&#x27;s relationship with the Roman Senate. Malitz writes that &quot;Nero abandoned the restraint he had previously shown because he believed a course supporting the Senate promised to be less and less profitable.&quot;

After Burrus&#x27; death, Nero appointed two new Praetorian prefects: Faenius Rufus and Ofonius Tigellinus. Politically isolated, Seneca was forced to retire. According to Tacitus, Nero divorced Octavia on grounds of infertility, and banished her. After public protests over Octavia&#x27;s exile, Nero accused her of adultery with Anicetus, and she was executed.

In AD 64 during the Saturnalia, Nero is said to have married Pythagoras, a freedman.

===Great Fire of Rome===
The Great Fire of Rome began on the night of 18 to 19 July 64, probably in one of the merchant shops on the slope of the Aventine overlooking the Circus Maximus, or in the wooden outer seating of the Circus itself. Rome had always been vulnerable to fires, and this one was fanned to catastrophic proportions by the winds. Tacitus, Cassius Dio, and modern archaeology describe the destruction of mansions, ordinary residences, public buildings, and temples on the Aventine, Palatine, and Caelian hills. The fire burned for over seven days before subsiding; it then started again and burned for three more. It destroyed three of Rome&#x27;s 14 districts and severely damaged seven more.

Some Romans thought the fire an accident, as the merchant shops were timber-framed and sold flammable goods, and the outer seating stands of the Circus were timber-built. Others claimed it was arson committed on Nero&#x27;s behalf. The accounts by Pliny the Elder, Suetonius, and Cassius Dio suggest several possible reasons for Nero&#x27;s alleged arson, including his creation of a real-life backdrop to a theatrical performance about the burning of Troy. Suetonius wrote that Nero started the fire to clear the site for his planned palatial Golden House. This would include lush artificial landscapes and a 30-meter-tall statue of himself, the Colossus of Nero, sited more or less where the Colosseum would eventually be built. Suetonius and Cassius Dio claim that Nero sang the &quot;Sack of Ilium&quot; in stage costume while the city burned. The popular legend that Nero played the lyre while Rome burned &quot;is at least partly a literary construct of Flavian propaganda ... which looked askance on the abortive Neronian attempt to rewrite Augustan models of rule&quot;.

Tacitus suspends judgment on Nero&#x27;s responsibility for the fire; he found that Nero was in Antium when the fire started, and returned to Rome to organize a relief effort, providing for the removal of bodies and debris, which he paid for from his own funds. After the fire, Nero opened his palaces to provide shelter for the homeless, and arranged for food supplies to be delivered in order to prevent starvation among the survivors.

Tacitus writes that to remove suspicion from himself, Nero accused Christians of starting the fire. According to this account, many Christians were arrested and brutally executed by &quot;being thrown to the beasts, crucified, and being burned alive&quot;. Tacitus asserts that in his imposition of such ferocious punishments, Nero was not motivated by a sense of justice, but by a penchant for personal cruelty.

Houses built after the fire were spaced out, built in brick, and faced by porticos on wide roads. Nero also built himself a new palace complex known as the Domus Aurea in an area cleared by the fire. The cost to rebuild Rome was immense, requiring funds the state treasury did not have. To find the necessary funds for the reconstruction, Nero&#x27;s government increased taxation. Particularly heavy tributes were imposed on the provinces of the empire. To meet at least a portion of the costs, Nero devalued the Roman currency, increasing inflationary pressure for the first time in the Empire&#x27;s history.

===Later years===
In AD 65, Gaius Calpurnius Piso, a Roman statesman, organized a conspiracy against Nero with the help of Subrius Flavus and Sulpicius Asper, a tribune and a centurion of the Praetorian Guard. According to Tacitus, many conspirators wished to &quot;rescue the state&quot; from the emperor and restore the Republic. The freedman Milichus discovered the conspiracy and reported it to Nero&#x27;s secretary, Epaphroditus. As a result, the conspiracy failed and its members were executed, including Lucan, the poet. Nero&#x27;s previous advisor Seneca was accused by Natalis; he denied the charges but was still ordered to commit suicide, as by this point he had fallen out of favor with Nero.

Nero was said to have kicked Poppaea to death in AD 65, before she could give birth to his second child. Modern historians, noting the probable biases of Suetonius, Tacitus, and Cassius Dio, and the likely absence of eyewitnesses to such an event, propose that Poppaea may have died after miscarriage or in childbirth. Nero went into deep mourning; Poppaea was given a sumptuous state funeral and divine honors, and was promised a temple for her cult. A year&#x27;s importation of incense was burned at the funeral. Her body was not cremated, as would have been strictly customary, but embalmed after the Egyptian manner and entombed; it is not known where.

In AD 67, Nero married Sporus, a young boy who is said to have greatly resembled Poppaea. Nero had him castrated and married him with all the usual ceremonies, including a dowry and a bridal veil. It is believed that he did this out of regret for his killing of Poppaea.

===Revolt of Vindex and Galba and Nero&#x27;s death===
In March 68, Gaius Julius Vindex, the governor of Gallia Lugdunensis, rebelled against Nero&#x27;s tax policies. Lucius Verginius Rufus, the governor of Germania Superior, was ordered to put down Vindex&#x27;s rebellion. In an attempt to gain support from outside his own province, Vindex called upon Servius Sulpicius Galba, the governor of Hispania Tarraconensis, to join the rebellion and to declare himself emperor in opposition to Nero.
At the Battle of Vesontio in May 68, Verginius&#x27; forces easily defeated those of Vindex, and the latter committed suicide. However, after defeating the rebel, Verginius&#x27; legions attempted to proclaim their own commander as Emperor. Verginius refused to act against Nero, but the discontent of the legions of Germania and the continued opposition of Galba in Hispania did not bode well for him.

While Nero had retained some control of the situation, support for Galba increased despite his being officially declared a &quot;public enemy&quot;. The prefect of the Praetorian Guard, Gaius Nymphidius Sabinus, also abandoned his allegiance to the Emperor and came out in support of Galba.

In response, Nero fled Rome with the intention of going to the port of Ostia and, from there, to take a fleet to one of the still-loyal eastern provinces. According to Suetonius, Nero abandoned the idea when some army officers openly refused to obey his commands, responding with a line from Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;: &quot;Is it so dreadful a thing then to die?&quot; Nero then toyed with the idea of fleeing to Parthia, throwing himself upon the mercy of Galba, or appealing to the people and begging them to pardon him for his past offences &quot;and if he could not soften their hearts, to entreat them at least to allow him the prefecture of Egypt&quot;. Suetonius reports that the text of this speech was later found in Nero&#x27;s writing desk, but that he dared not give it from fear of being torn to pieces before he could reach the Forum.

Nero returned to Rome and spent the evening in the palace. After sleeping, he awoke at about midnight to find the palace guard had left. Dispatching messages to his friends&#x27; palace chambers for them to come, he received no answers. Upon going to their chambers personally, he found them all abandoned. When he called for a gladiator or anyone else adept with a sword to kill him, no one appeared. He cried, &quot;Have I neither friend nor foe?&quot; and ran out as if to throw himself into the Tiber.
Returning, Nero sought a place where he could hide and collect his thoughts. An imperial freedman, Phaon, offered his villa, outside the city. Travelling in disguise, Nero and four loyal freedmen, Epaphroditus, Phaon, Neophytus, and Sporus, reached the villa, where Nero ordered them to dig a grave for him. At this time, Nero learned that the Senate had declared him a public enemy. Nero prepared himself for suicide, pacing up and down muttering &quot;Qualis artifex pereo&quot; (&quot;What an artist the world is losing!&quot;). Losing his nerve, he begged one of his companions to set an example by killing himself first. At last, the sound of approaching horsemen drove Nero to face the end. However, he still could not bring himself to take his own life, but instead forced his private secretary, Epaphroditus, to perform the task.
When one of the horsemen entered and saw that Nero was dying, he attempted to stop the bleeding, but efforts to save Nero&#x27;s life were unsuccessful. Nero&#x27;s final words were &quot;Too late! This is fidelity!&quot;. He died on 9 June 68, the anniversary of the death of his first wife, Claudia Octavia, and was buried in the Mausoleum of the Domitii Ahenobarbi, in what is now the Villa Borghese (Pincian Hill) area of Rome. According to Sulpicius Severus, it is unclear whether Nero took his own life.

With his death, the Julio-Claudian dynasty ended. Chaos would ensue in the year of the Four Emperors.

===After Nero===
According to Suetonius and Cassius Dio, the people of Rome celebrated the death of Nero. Tacitus, though, describes a more complicated political environment. Tacitus mentions that Nero&#x27;s death was welcomed by senators, nobility, and the upper class. The lower class, slaves, frequenters of the arena and the theater, and &quot;those who were supported by the famous excesses of Nero&quot;, on the other hand, were upset with the news. Members of the military were said to have mixed feelings, as they had allegiance to Nero but had been bribed to overthrow him.

Eastern sources, namely Philostratus and Apollonius of Tyana, mention that Nero&#x27;s death was mourned as he &quot;restored the liberties of Hellas with a wisdom and moderation quite alien to his character&quot;, and that he &quot;held our liberties in his hand and respected them&quot;. Modern scholarship generally holds that, while the Senate and more well-off individuals welcomed Nero&#x27;s death, the general populace was &quot;loyal to the end and beyond, for Otho and Vitellius both thought it worthwhile to appeal to their nostalgia&quot;.

Nero&#x27;s name was erased from some monuments, in what Edward Champlin regards as an &quot;outburst of private zeal&quot;. Many portraits of Nero were reworked to represent other figures; according to Eric R. Varner, over 50 such images survive. This reworking of images is often explained as part of the way in which the memory of disgraced emperors was condemned posthumously, a practice known as &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;. Champlin doubts that the practice is necessarily negative and notes that some continued to create images of Nero long after his death. Damaged portraits of Nero, often with hammer blows directed to the face, have been found in many provinces of the Roman Empire, three recently having been identified from the United Kingdom.

The civil war during the year of the Four Emperors was described by ancient historians as a troubling period. According to Tacitus, this instability was rooted in the fact that emperors could no longer rely on the perceived legitimacy of the imperial bloodline, as Nero and those before him could. Galba began his short reign with the execution of many of Nero&#x27;s allies. One such notable enemy included Nymphidius Sabinus, who claimed to be the son of Emperor Caligula.

Otho overthrew Galba. Otho was said to be liked by many soldiers because he had been a friend of Nero and resembled him somewhat in temperament. It was said that the common Roman hailed Otho as Nero himself. Otho used &quot;Nero&quot; as a surname and reerected many statues to Nero. Vitellius overthrew Otho. Vitellius began his reign with a large funeral for Nero complete with songs written by Nero.

After Nero&#x27;s death in AD 68, there was a widespread belief, especially in the eastern provinces, that he was not dead and somehow would return. This belief came to be known as the Nero Redivivus Legend. The legend of Nero&#x27;s return lasted for hundreds of years after Nero&#x27;s death. Augustine of Hippo wrote of the legend as a popular belief in AD 422.

At least three Nero impostors emerged leading rebellions. The first, who sang and played the cithara or lyre, and whose face was similar to that of the dead emperor, appeared in 69 AD during the reign of Vitellius. After persuading some to recognize him, he was captured and executed. Sometime during the reign of Titus (79–81), another impostor appeared in Asia and sang to the accompaniment of the lyre and looked like Nero, but he, too, was killed. Twenty years after Nero&#x27;s death, during the reign of Domitian, there was a third pretender. He was supported by the Parthians, who only reluctantly gave him up, and the matter almost came to war.

==Military conflicts==

===Boudica&#x27;s uprising===

In Britannia (Britain) in AD 59, Prasutagus, leader of the Iceni tribe and a client king of Rome during Claudius&#x27; reign, had died. The client state arrangement was unlikely to survive following the death of Claudius. The will of the Iceni tribal King Prasutagus, leaving control of the Iceni to his daughters, was denied. When the Roman procurator Catus Decianus scourged Prasutagus&#x27; wife Boudica and raped her daughters, the Iceni revolted. They were joined by the Celtic Trinovantes tribe and their uprising became the most significant provincial rebellion of the 1st century AD. Under Queen Boudica, the towns of Camulodunum (Colchester), Londinium (London) and Verulamium (St. Albans) were burned, and a substantial body of Roman legion infantry were eliminated. The governor of the province, Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, assembled his remaining forces and defeated the Britons. Although order was restored for some time, Nero considered abandoning the province. Julius Classicianus replaced the former procurator, Catus Decianus, and Classicianus advised Nero to replace Paulinus who continued to punish the population even after the rebellion was over. Nero decided to adopt a more lenient approach by appointing a new governor, Petronius Turpilianus.

===Peace with Parthia===

Nero began preparing for war in the early years of his reign, after the Parthian king Vologeses set his brother Tiridates on the Armenian throne. Around AD 57 and AD 58 Domitius Corbulo and his legions advanced on Tiridates and captured the Armenian capital Artaxata. Tigranes was chosen to replace Tiridates on the Armenian throne. When Tigranes attacked Adiabene, Nero had to send further legions to defend Armenia and Syria from Parthia.

The Roman victory came at a time when the Parthians were troubled by revolts; when this was dealt with they were able to devote resources to the Armenian situation. A Roman army under Paetus surrendered under humiliating circumstances and though both Roman and Parthian forces withdrew from Armenia, it was under Parthian control. The triumphal arch for Corbulo&#x27;s earlier victory was part-built when Parthian envoys arrived in AD 63 to discuss treaties. Given &quot;imperium&quot; over the eastern regions, Corbulo organised his forces for an invasion but was met by this Parthian delegation. An agreement was thereafter reached with the Parthians: Rome would recognize Tiridates as king of Armenia, only if he agreed to receive his diadem from Nero. A coronation ceremony was held in Italy AD 66. Dio reports that Tiridates said &quot;I have come to you, my God, worshiping you as Mithras.&quot; Shotter says this parallels other divine designations that were commonly applied to Nero in the East including &quot;The New Apollo&quot; and &quot;The New Sun&quot;. After the coronation, friendly relations were established between Rome and the eastern kingdoms of Parthia and Armenia. Artaxata was temporarily renamed Neroneia.

===First Jewish War===

In 66, there was a Jewish revolt in Judea stemming from Greek and Jewish religious tension. In 67, Nero dispatched Vespasian to restore order. This revolt was eventually put down in 70, after Nero&#x27;s death. This revolt is famous for Romans breaching the walls of Jerusalem and destroying the Second Temple of Jerusalem.

==Pursuits==

Nero studied poetry, music, painting and sculpture. He both sang and played the &quot;cithara&quot; (a type of lyre). Many of these disciplines were standard education for the Roman elite, but Nero&#x27;s devotion to music exceeded what was socially acceptable for a Roman of his class. Ancient sources were critical of Nero&#x27;s emphasis on the arts, chariot-racing and athletics. Pliny described Nero as an &quot;actor-emperor&quot; (&quot;scaenici imperatoris&quot;) and Suetonius wrote that he was &quot;carried away by a craze for popularity...since he was acclaimed as the equal of Apollo in music and of the Sun in driving a chariot, he had planned to emulate the exploits of Hercules as well.&quot;

In AD 67 Nero participated in the Olympics. He had bribed organizers to postpone the games for a year so he could participate, and artistic competitions were added to the athletic events. Nero won every contest in which he was a competitor. During the games Nero sang and played his lyre on stage, acted in tragedies and raced chariots. He won a 10-horse chariot race, despite being thrown from the chariot and leaving the race. He was crowned on the basis that he would have won if he had completed the race. After he died a year later, his name was removed from the list of winners. Champlin writes that though Nero&#x27;s participation &quot;effectively stifled true competition, [Nero] seems to have been oblivious of reality.&quot;

Nero established the Neronian games in AD 60. Modeled on Greek style games, these games included musical, gymnastic, and equestrian contests. According to Suetonius the gymnastic contests were held in the Saepta area of the Campus Martius.

==Historiography==

The history of Nero&#x27;s reign is problematic in that no historical sources survived that were contemporary with Nero. These first histories, while they still existed, were described as biased and fantastical, either overly critical or praising of Nero. The original sources were also said to contradict on a number of events. Nonetheless, these lost primary sources were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on Nero written by the next generations of historians. A few of the contemporary historians are known by name. Fabius Rusticus, Cluvius Rufus and Pliny the Elder all wrote condemning histories on Nero that are now lost. There were also pro-Nero histories, but it is unknown who wrote them or for what deeds Nero was praised.

The bulk of what is known of Nero comes from Tacitus, Suetonius, and Cassius Dio, who were all of the upper classes. Tacitus and Suetonius wrote their histories on Nero over 50 years after his death, while Cassius Dio wrote his history over 150 years after Nero&#x27;s death. These sources contradict one another on a number of events in Nero&#x27;s life, including the death of Claudius, the death of Agrippina, and the Roman fire of AD 64, but they are consistent in their condemnation of Nero.

;Cassius Dio
Cassius Dio (c. 155–229) was the son of Cassius Apronianus, a Roman senator. He passed the greater part of his life in public service. He was a senator under Commodus and governor of Smyrna after the death of Septimius Severus; and afterwards suffect consul around 205, and also proconsul in Africa and Pannonia.

Books 61–63 of Dio&#x27;s &quot;Roman History&quot; describe the reign of Nero. Only fragments of these books remain and what does remain was abridged and altered by John Xiphilinus, an 11th-century monk.

;Dio Chrysostom
Dio Chrysostom (c. 40–120), a Greek philosopher and historian, wrote the Roman people were very happy with Nero and would have allowed him to rule indefinitely. They longed for his rule once he was gone and embraced imposters when they appeared:

;Epictetus
Epictetus (c. 55–135) was the slave to Nero&#x27;s scribe Epaphroditos. He makes a few passing negative comments on Nero&#x27;s character in his work, but makes no remarks on the nature of his rule. He describes Nero as a spoiled, angry and unhappy man.

;Josephus
The historian Josephus (c. 37–100), while calling Nero a tyrant, was also the first to mention bias against Nero. Of other historians, he said:


;Lucan
Although more of a poet than a historian, Lucanus (c. 39–65) has one of the kindest accounts of Nero&#x27;s rule. He writes of peace and prosperity under Nero, in contrast to previous war and strife. Ironically, he was later involved in a conspiracy to overthrow Nero and was executed.

;Philostratus
Philostratus II, &quot;the Athenian&quot; (c. 172–250), spoke of Nero in the &quot;Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot; (Books 4–5). Although he has a generally bad or dim view of Nero, he speaks of others&#x27; positive reception of Nero in the East.

;Pliny the Elder
The history of Nero by Pliny the Elder (c. 24–79) did not survive. Still, there are several references to Nero in Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural Histories&quot;. Pliny has one of the worst opinions of Nero and calls him an &quot;enemy of mankind&quot;.

;Plutarch
Plutarch (c. 46–127) mentions Nero indirectly in his account of the Life of Galba and the Life of Otho, as well as in the Vision of Thespesius in Book 7 of the Moralia, where a voice orders that Nero&#x27;s soul be transferred to a more offensive species. Nero is portrayed as a tyrant, but those that replace him are not described as better.

;Seneca the Younger
Seneca (c. 4 BC–AD 65), Nero&#x27;s teacher and advisor, writes very positively of Nero.

;Suetonius

Suetonius (c. 69–130) was a member of the equestrian order, and he was the head of the department of the imperial correspondence. While in this position, Suetonius started writing biographies of the emperors, accentuating the anecdotal and sensational aspects. By this account, Nero raped the vestal virgin Rubria.

;Tacitus

The &quot;Annals&quot; by Tacitus (c. 56–117) is the most detailed and comprehensive history on the rule of Nero, despite being incomplete after the year AD 66. Tacitus described the rule of the Julio-Claudian emperors as generally unjust. He also thought that existing writing on them was unbalanced:

Tacitus was the son of a procurator, who married into the elite family of Agricola. He entered his political life as a senator after Nero&#x27;s death and, by Tacitus&#x27; own admission, owed much to Nero&#x27;s rivals. Realising that this bias may be apparent to others, Tacitus protests that his writing is true.

; Girolamo Cardano
In 1562, Girolamo Cardano published in Basel his &quot;Encomium Neronis&quot;, which was one of the first historical references of the modern era to portray Nero in a positive light.

==In Jewish and Christian tradition==

===Jewish tradition===
An Aggadah in the Talmud says that at the end of AD 66, conflict broke out between Greeks and Jews in Jerusalem and Caesarea. According to the Talmud, during the Great Jewish Revolt, Nero went to Jerusalem and shot arrows in all four directions. All the arrows landed in the city. He then asked a passing child to repeat the verse he had learned that day. The child responded, &quot;I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel&quot; (Ezekiel 25:14). Upon hearing this, Nero became terrified, believing that God wanted the Second Temple to be destroyed, but that he would punish the one to carry it out. Nero said, &quot;He desires to lay waste His House and to lay the blame on me,&quot; whereupon he fled and converted to Judaism to avoid such retribution. Vespasian was then dispatched to put down the rebellion.

The Talmud adds that the sage Reb Meir Baal HaNess lived in the time of the Mishnah, and was a prominent supporter of the Bar Kokhba rebellion against Roman rule. Rabbi Meir was considered one of the greatest of the Tannaim of the third generation (139–163). According to the Talmud, he was a descendant of Nero, who had converted to Judaism. His wife Bruriah is one of the few women cited in the Gemara. He is the third-most-frequently-mentioned sage in the Mishnah. 

The Talmudic legend about Nero is not supported by contemporary sources. Roman and Greek sources nowhere report Nero&#x27;s alleged trip to Jerusalem or his alleged conversion to Judaism. There is also no record of Nero having any offspring who survived infancy: his only recorded child, Claudia Augusta, died aged 4 months.

===Christian tradition===

Tacitus describes Nero extensively torturing and executing Christians after the fire of AD 64. Suetonius also mentions Nero punishing Christians, though he does so because they are &quot;given to a new and mischievous superstition&quot; and does not connect it with the fire.

Christian writer Tertullian (c. 155–230) was the first to call Nero the first persecutor of Christians. He wrote, &quot;Examine your records. There you will find that Nero was the first that persecuted this doctrine.&quot; Lactantius (c. 240–320) also said that Nero &quot;first persecuted the servants of God,&quot; as did Sulpicius Severus. However, Suetonius writes that, &quot;since the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, the [emperor Claudius] expelled them from Rome&quot; (&quot;Iudaeos impulsore Chresto assidue tumultuantis Roma expulit&quot;). These expelled &quot;Jews&quot; may have been early Christians, although Suetonius is not explicit. Nor is the Bible explicit, calling Aquila of Pontus and his wife, Priscilla, both expelled from Italy at the time, &quot;Jews&quot; (Acts 18:2).

====Martyrdoms of Peter and Paul====
The first text to suggest that Nero ordered the execution of an apostle is a letter by Clement to the Corinthians traditionally dated to around AD 96. The apocryphal Ascension of Isaiah, a Christian writing from the 2nd century, says, &quot;the slayer of his mother, who himself (even) this king, will persecute the plant which the Twelve Apostles of the Beloved have planted. Of the Twelve one will be delivered into his hands&quot;; this is interpreted as referring to Nero.

Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea (c. 275–339) was the first to write explicitly that Paul was beheaded and Peter crucified in Rome during the reign of Nero. He states that Nero&#x27;s persecution led to Peter and Paul&#x27;s deaths, but that Nero did not give any specific orders. However, several other accounts going back to the first century have Paul surviving his two years in Rome and travelling to Hispania, before facing trial in Rome again prior to his death.

Peter is first said to have been crucified specifically upside-down in Rome during Nero&#x27;s reign in the apocryphal Acts of Peter (c. 200). The account ends with Paul still alive and Nero abiding by God&#x27;s command not to persecute any more Christians.

By the fourth century, a number of writers were stating that Nero killed Peter and Paul.

====Antichrist====

The Sibylline Oracles, Book 5 and 8, written in the second century, speak of Nero returning and bringing destruction. Within Christian communities, these writings, along with others, fueled the belief that Nero would return as the Antichrist. In 310, Lactantius wrote that Nero &quot;suddenly disappeared, and even the burial place of that noxious wild beast was nowhere to be seen. This has led some persons of extravagant imagination to suppose that, having been conveyed to a distant region, he is still reserved alive; and to him they apply the Sibylline verses.&quot; Lactantius maintains that it is not right to believe this.

In 422, Augustine of Hippo wrote about 2 Thessalonians 2:1–11, where he believed that Paul mentioned the coming of the Antichrist. Although he rejects the theory, Augustine mentions that many Christians believed Nero was the Antichrist or would return as the Antichrist. He wrote that, &quot;in saying, &#x27;For the mystery of iniquity doth already work,&#x27; he alluded to Nero, whose deeds already seemed to be as the deeds of Antichrist.&quot;

Some modern biblical scholars such as Delbert Hillers (Johns Hopkins University) of the American Schools of Oriental Research and the editors of the &quot;Oxford Study Bible&quot; and &quot;HarperCollins Study Bible&quot;, contend that the number 666 in the Book of Revelation is a code for Nero, a view that is also supported in Roman Catholic Biblical commentaries. The statement concerns Revelation 17:1-18, which according to Scott G. Sinclair, in the period when John wrote, Babylon normally represented Rome (e.g., 1 Peter 5:13).

<doc id="21634" wikidata="Q60571" url="?curid=21634" title="Neoclassical economics">
<text>Neoclassical economics is an approach to economics in which the production, consumption, and valuation (pricing) of goods and services are observed as driven by the supply and demand model. According to this line of thought, the value of a good or service is determined through a hypothetical maximization of utility by income-constrained individuals and of profits by firms facing production costs and employing available information and factors of production. This approach has often been justified by appealing to rational choice theory.

Neoclassical economics is the dominant approach to microeconomics and, together with Keynesian economics, formed the neoclassical synthesis which dominated mainstream economics as &quot;neo-Keynesian economics&quot; from the 1950s onward.

==Classification==
The term was originally introduced by Thorstein Veblen in his 1900 article &quot;Preconceptions of Economic Science&quot;, in which he related marginalists in the tradition of Alfred Marshall &quot;et al.&quot; to those in the Austrian School.

No attempt will here be made even to pass a verdict on the relative claims of the recognized two or three main &quot;schools&quot; of theory, beyond the somewhat obvious finding that, for the purpose in hand, the so-called Austrian school is scarcely distinguishable from the neo-classical, unless it be in the different distribution of emphasis. The divergence between the modernized classical views, on the one hand, and the historical and Marxist schools, on the other hand, is wider, so much so, indeed, as to bar out a consideration of the postulates of the latter under the same head of inquiry with the former.
It was later used by John Hicks, George Stigler, and others to include the work of Carl Menger, William Stanley Jevons, Léon Walras, John Bates Clark, and many others. Today it is usually used to refer to mainstream economics, although it has also been used as an umbrella term encompassing a number of other schools of thought, notably excluding institutional economics, various historical schools of economics, and Marxian economics, in addition to various other heterodox approaches to economics.

Neoclassical economics is characterized by several assumptions common to many schools of economic thought. There is not a complete agreement on what is meant by neoclassical economics, and the result is a wide range of neoclassical approaches to various problem areas and domains—ranging from neoclassical theories of labor to neoclassical theories of demographic changes.

== Theory ==

=== Assumptions and objectives ===
It was expressed by E. Roy Weintraub that neoclassical economics rests on three assumptions, although certain branches of neoclassical theory may have different approaches:

* People have rational preferences between outcomes that can be identified and associated with values.
* Individuals maximize utility and firms maximize profits.
* People act independently on the basis of full and relevant information.

From these three assumptions, neoclassical economists have built a structure to understand the allocation of scarce resources among alternative ends—in fact, understanding such allocation is often considered the definition of economics to neoclassical theorists. Here is how William Stanley Jevons presented &quot;the problem of Economics&quot;.

Given, a certain population, with various needs and powers of production, in possession of certain lands and other sources of material: required, the mode of employing their labor which will maximize the utility of their produce.

From the basic assumptions of neoclassical economics comes a wide range of theories about various areas of economic activity. For example, profit maximization lies behind the neoclassical theory of the firm, while the derivation of demand curves leads to an understanding of consumer goods, and the supply curve allows an analysis of the factors of production. Utility maximization is the source for the neoclassical theory of consumption, the derivation of demand curves for consumer goods, and the derivation of labor supply curves and reservation demand.

=== Supply and demand model ===
Market analysis is typically the neoclassical answer to price questions, such as why does an apple cost less than an automobile, why does the performance of work command a wage, or how to account for interest as a reward for saving. An important device of neoclassical market analysis is the graph presenting supply and demand curves. The curves reflect the behavior of individual buyers and individual sellers. Buyers and sellers interact with each other in and through these markets, and their interactions determine the market prices of anything they buy and sell. In the following graph, the specific price of the commodity being bought/sold is represented by P*.

In reaching agreed outcomes of their interactions, the market behaviors of buyers and sellers are driven by their preferences (= wants, utilities, tastes, choices) and productive abilities (= technologies, resources). This creates a complex relationship between buyers and sellers. Thus, the geometrical analytics of supply and demand is only a simplified way how to describe and explore their interaction.
Market supply and demand are aggregated across firms and individuals. Their interactions determine equilibrium output and price. The market supply and demand for each factor of production is derived analogously to those for market final output to determine equilibrium income and the income distribution. Factor demand incorporates the marginal productivity relationship of that factor in the output market.

Neoclassical economics emphasizes equilibria, which are the solutions of agent maximization problems. Regularities in economies are explained by methodological individualism, the position that economic phenomena can be explained by aggregating over the behavior of agents. The emphasis is on microeconomics. Institutions, which might be considered as before and conditioning individual behavior, are de-emphasized. Economic subjectivism accompanies these emphases.

=== Utility theory of value ===
Neoclassical economics uses the utility theory of value, which states that the value of a good is determined by the marginal utility experienced by the user. This is one of the main distinguishing factors between neoclassical economics and other earlier economic theories, such as Classical and Marxian, which use the labor theory of value that value is determined by the labor required for production.

The partial definition of the neoclassical theory of value states that the value of an object of market exchange is determined by human interaction between the preferences and productive abilities of individuals. This is one of the most important neoclassical hypotheses. However, the neoclassical theory also asks what exactly is causing the supply and demand behaviors of buyers and sellers, and how exactly the preferences and productive abilities of people determine the market prices. Therefore, the neoclassical theory of value is a theory of these forces: the preferences and productive abilities of humans. They are the final causal determinants of the behavior of supply and demand and therefore of value. According to neoclassical economics, individual preferences and productive abilities are the essential forces that generate all other economic events (demands, supplies, and prices).

=== Market failure and externalities ===
Despite favoring markets to organize economic activity, neoclassical theory acknowledges that markets do not always produce the socially desirable outcome due to the presence of externalities. Externalities are considered a form of market failure. Neoclassical economists vary in terms of the significance they ascribe to externalities in market outcomes.

=== Pareto criterion ===
In a market with a very large number of participants and under appropriate conditions, for each good, there will be a unique price that allows all welfare–improving transactions to take place. This price is determined by the actions of the individuals pursuing their preferences. If these prices are flexible, meaning that all parties are able to pursue transactions at any rates they find mutually beneficial, they will, under appropriate assumptions, tend to settle at price levels that allow for all welfare–improving transactions. Under these assumptions, free-market processes yield an optimum of social welfare. This type of group welfare is called the Pareto optimum (criterion) after its discoverer Vilfredo Pareto.
Wolff and Resnick (2012) describe the Pareto optimality in another way. According to them, the term &quot;Pareto optimal point&quot; signifies the equality of consumption and production, which indicates that the demand (as a ratio of marginal utilities) and supply (as a ratio of marginal costs) sides of an economy are in balance with each other. The Pareto optimum point also signifies that society has fully realized its potential output.

Normative judgments in neoclassical economics are shaped by the Pareto criterion. As a result, many neoclassical economists favor a relatively laissez-faire approach to government intervention in markets, since it is very difficult to make a change where no one will be worse off. However, many less conservative neoclassical economists instead use the compensation principle, which says that an intervention is good if the total gains are larger than the total losses, even if losers are not compensated in practice.

=== International trade ===
Neoclassical economics favors free trade according to David Ricardo&#x27;s theory of comparative advantage. This idea holds that free trade between two countries is mutually beneficial because it allows the greatest total consumption in both countries.

== Origins ==

Classical economics, developed in the 18th and 19th centuries, included a value theory and distribution theory. The value of a product was thought to depend on the costs involved in producing that product. The explanation of costs in classical economics was simultaneously an explanation of distribution. A landlord received rent, workers received wages, and a capitalist tenant farmer received profits on their investment. This classic approach included the work of Adam Smith and David Ricardo.

However, some economists gradually began emphasizing the perceived value of a good to the consumer. They proposed a theory that the value of a product was to be explained with differences in utility (usefulness) to the consumer. (In England, economists tended to conceptualize utility in keeping with the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham and later of John Stuart Mill.)

The third step from political economy to economics was the introduction of marginalism and the proposition that economic actors made decisions based on margins. For example, a person decides to buy a second sandwich based on how full he or she is after the first one, a firm hires a new employee based on the expected increase in profits the employee will bring. This differs from the aggregate decision-making of classical political economy in that it explains how vital goods such as water can be cheap, while luxuries can be expensive.

===Marginal revolution===
The change in economic theory from classical to neoclassical economics has been called the &quot;marginal revolution&quot;, although it has been argued that the process was slower than the term suggests. It is frequently dated from William Stanley Jevons&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Political Economy&quot; (1871), Carl Menger&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Economics&quot; (1871), and Léon Walras&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Pure Economics&quot; (1874–1877). Historians of economics and economists have debated:
* Whether utility or marginalism was more essential to this revolution (whether the noun or the adjective in the phrase &quot;marginal utility&quot; is more important)
* Whether there was a revolutionary change of thought or merely a gradual development and change of emphasis from their predecessors
* Whether grouping these economists together disguises differences more important than their similarities.

In particular, Jevons saw his economics as an application and development of Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s utilitarianism and never had a fully developed general equilibrium theory. Menger did not embrace this hedonic conception, explained diminishing marginal utility in terms of subjective prioritization of possible uses, and emphasized disequilibrium and the discrete; further, Menger had an objection to the use of mathematics in economics, while the other two modeled their theories after 19th-century mechanics. Jevons built on the hedonic conception of Bentham or of Mill, while Walras was more interested in the interaction of markets than in explaining the individual psyche.

Alfred Marshall&#x27;s textbook, &quot;Principles of Economics&quot; (1890), was the dominant textbook in England a generation later. Marshall&#x27;s influence extended elsewhere; Italians would compliment Maffeo Pantaleoni by calling him the &quot;Marshall of Italy&quot;. Marshall thought classical economics attempted to explain prices by the cost of production. He asserted that earlier marginalists went too far in correcting this imbalance by overemphasizing utility and demand. Marshall thought that &quot;We might as reasonably dispute whether it is the upper
or the under blade of a pair of scissors that cuts a piece of paper, as to whether the value is governed by utility or cost of production&quot;.

Marshall explained price by the intersection of supply and demand curves. The introduction of different market &quot;periods&quot; was an important innovation of Marshall&#x27;s:
* Market period. The goods produced for sale on the market are taken as given data, e.g. in a fish market. Prices quickly adjust to clear markets.
* Short period. Industrial capacity is taken as given. The level of output, the level of employment, the inputs of raw materials, and prices fluctuate to equate marginal cost and marginal revenue, where profits are maximized. Economic rents exist in short period equilibrium for fixed factors, and the rate of profit is not equated across sectors.
* Long period. The stock of capital goods, such as factories and machines, is not taken as given. Profit-maximizing equilibria determine both industrial capacity and the level at which it is operated.
* Very long period. Technology, population trends, habits, and customs are not taken as given but allowed to vary in very long period models.
Marshall took supply and demand as stable functions and extended supply and demand explanations of prices to all runs. He argued supply was easier to vary in longer runs, and thus became a more important determinant of price in the very long run.

===Cambridge and Lausanne school===
Cambridge and Lausanne School of economics form the basis of neoclassical economics. Until the 1930s, the evolution of neoclassical economics was determined by the Cambridge school and was based on the marginal equilibrium theory. At the beginning of the 1930s, the Lausanne general equilibrium theory became the general basis of neoclassical economics and the marginal equilibrium theory was understood as its simplification.

The thinking of the Cambridge school continued in the steps of classical political economics and its traditions but was based on the new approach that originated from the marginalist revolution. Its founder was Alfred Marshall, and among the main representatives were Arthur Cecil Pigou, Ralph George Hawtrey and Dennis Holme Robertson. Pigou worked on the theory of welfare economics and the quantity theory of money. Hawtrey and Robertson developed the Cambridge cash balance approach to theory of money and influenced the trade cycle theory. Until the 1930s, John Maynard Keynes was also influencing the theoretical concepts of the Cambridge school. The key characteristic of the Cambridge school was its instrumental approach to the economy – the role of the theoretical economist is first to define theoretical instruments of economic analysis and only just then apply them to real economic problems.

The main representatives of the Lausanne school of economic thought were Léon Walras, Vilfredo Pareto and Enrico Barone. The school became famous for developing the general equilibrium theory. In the contemporary economy, the general equilibrium theory is the methodologic basis of mainstream economics in the form of New classical macroeconomics and New Keynesian macroeconomics.

== Evolution ==

The evolution of neoclassical economics can be divided into three phases. The first phase (= a pre-Keynesian phase) is dated between the initial forming of neoclassical economics (the second half of the nineteenth century) and the arrival of Keynesian economics in the 1930s. The second phase is dated between the year 1940 and the half of the 1970s. During this era, Keynesian economics was dominating the world&#x27;s economy but neoclassical economics did not cease to exist. It continued in the development of its microeconomics theory and began creating its own macroeconomics theory. The development of the neoclassical macroeconomic theory was based on the development of the quantity theory of money and the theory of distribution. One of the products of the second phase was the Neoclassical synthesis, representing a special combination of neoclassical microeconomics and Keynesian macroeconomics. The third phase began in the 1970s. During this era, Keynesian economics was in crisis, which encouraged the creation of new neoclassical lines of thoughts such as Monetarism and New classical macroeconomics. Despite the diverse focus and approach of these theories, they are all based on the theoretic and methodologic principles of traditional neoclassical economics.

An important change in neoclassical economics occurred around 1933. Joan Robinson and Edward H. Chamberlin, with the nearly simultaneous publication of their respective books, &quot;The Economics of Imperfect Competition&quot; (1933) and &quot;The Theory of Monopolistic Competition&quot; (1933), introduced models of imperfect competition. Theories of market forms and industrial organization grew out of this work. They also emphasized certain tools, such as the marginal revenue curve. In her book, Robinson formalized a type of limited competition. The conclusions of her work for welfare economics were worrying: they were implying that the market mechanism operates in a way that the workers are not paid according to the full value of their marginal productivity of labor and that also the principle of consumer sovereignty is impaired. This theory heavily influenced the anti–trust policies of many Western countries in the 1940s and 1950s.

Joan Robinson&#x27;s work on imperfect competition, at least, was a response to certain problems of Marshallian partial equilibrium theory highlighted by Piero Sraffa. Anglo-American economists also responded to these problems by turning towards general equilibrium theory, developed on the European continent by Walras and Vilfredo Pareto. J. R. Hicks&#x27;s &quot;Value and Capital&quot; (1939) was influential in introducing his English-speaking colleagues to these traditions. He, in turn, was influenced by the Austrian School economist Friedrich Hayek&#x27;s move to the London School of Economics, where Hicks then studied.

These developments were accompanied by the introduction of new tools, such as indifference curves and the theory of ordinal utility. The level of mathematical sophistication of neoclassical economics increased. Paul Samuelson&#x27;s &quot;Foundations of Economic Analysis&quot; (1947) contributed to this increase in mathematical modeling.

The interwar period in American economics has been argued to have been pluralistic, with neoclassical economics and institutionalism competing for allegiance. Frank Knight, an early Chicago school economist attempted to combine both schools. But this increase in mathematics was accompanied by greater dominance of neoclassical economics in Anglo-American universities after World War II. Some argue that outside political interventions, such as McCarthyism, and internal ideological bullying played an important role in this rise to dominance.

Hicks&#x27; book, &quot;Value and Capital&quot; had two main parts. The second, which was arguably not immediately influential, presented a model of temporary equilibrium. Hicks was influenced directly by Hayek&#x27;s notion of intertemporal coordination and paralleled by earlier work by Lindhal. This was part of an abandonment of disaggregated long-run models. This trend probably reached its culmination with the Arrow–Debreu model of intertemporal equilibrium. The Arrow–Debreu model has canonical presentations in Gérard Debreu&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Value&quot; (1959) and in Arrow and Hahn&#x27;s &quot;General Competitive Analysis&quot; (1971).

=== Neoclassical synthesis ===
Many of these developments were against the backdrop of improvements in both econometrics, that is the ability to measure prices and changes in goods and services, as well as their aggregate quantities, and in the creation of macroeconomics, or the study of whole economies. The attempt to combine neo-classical microeconomics and Keynesian macroeconomics would lead to the neoclassical synthesis which was the dominant paradigm of economic reasoning in English-speaking countries from the 1950s till the 1970s. Hicks and Samuelson were for example instrumental in mainstreaming Keynesian economics.

The dominance of Keynesian economics was upset by its inability to explain the economic crises of the 1970s- neoclassical economics emerged distinctly in macroeconomics as the new classical school, which sought to explain macroeconomic phenomenon using neoclassical microeconomics. It and its contemporary New Keynesian economics contributed to the new neoclassical synthesis of the 1990s, which informs much of mainstream macroeconomics today.

=== Cambridge capital controversy ===
Problems exist with making the neoclassical general equilibrium theory compatible with an economy that develops over time and includes capital goods. This was explored in a major debate in the 1960s—the &quot;Cambridge capital controversy&quot;—about the validity of neoclassical economics, with an emphasis on economic growth, capital, aggregate theory, and the marginal productivity theory of distribution. There were also internal attempts by neoclassical economists to extend the Arrow–Debreu model to disequilibrium investigations of stability and uniqueness. However, a result known as the Sonnenschein–Mantel–Debreu theorem suggests that the assumptions that must be made to ensure that equilibrium is stable and unique are quite restrictive.

== Criticisms ==
Although the neoclassical approach is dominant in economics, the field of economics includes others, such as Marxist, behavioral, Schumpeterian, developmentalist, Austrian, post-Keynesian, Humanistic economics, real-world economics and institutionalist schools. All of these schools differ with the neoclassical school and each other, and incorporate various criticisms of the neoclassical economics. Not all criticism comes from other schools: some prominent economists such as Nobel Prize recipient and former chief economist of the World Bank Joseph Stiglitz are vocally critical of mainstream neoclassical economics.

=== Methodology and mathematical models ===


Some see mathematical models used in contemporary research in mainstream economics as having transcended neoclassical economics, while others disagree. Mathematical models also include those in game theory, linear programming, and econometrics. Critics of neoclassical economics are divided into those who think that highly mathematical method is inherently wrong and those who think that mathematical method is useful even if neoclassical economics has other problems.

Critics such as Tony Lawson contend that neoclassical economics&#x27; reliance on functional relations is inadequate for social phenomena in which knowledge of one variable does not reliably predict another. The different factors affecting economic outcomes cannot be experimentally isolated from one another in a laboratory; therefore the explanatory and predictive power of mathematical economic analysis is limited. Lawson proposes an alternative approach called the contrast explanation which he says is better suited for determining causes of events in social sciences. More broadly, critics of economics as a science vary, with some believing that all mathematical economics is problematic or even pseudoscience and others believing it is still useful but has less certainty and higher risk of methodology problems than in other fields.

Milton Friedman, one of the most prominent and influential neoclassical economists of the 20th century, responded to criticisms that assumptions in economic models were often unrealistic by saying that theories should be judged by their ability to predict events rather than by the supposed realism of their assumptions. He claimed that, on the contrary, a theory with more absurd assumptions has stronger predictive power. He argued that a theory&#x27;s ability to theoretically explain reality is irrelevant compared to its ability to empirically predict reality, no matter the method of getting to that prediction.

=== Objectivity and pluralism ===
Neoclassical economics is often criticized for having a normative bias despite sometimes claiming to be &quot;value-free&quot;. Such critics argue an ideological side of neoclassical economics, generally to argue that students should be taught more than one economic theory and that economics departments should be more pluralistic.

=== Rational behavior assumptions ===
One of the most widely criticized aspects of neoclassical economics is its set of assumptions about human behavior and rationality. The &quot;economic man&quot;, or a hypothetical human who acts according to neoclassical assumptions, does not necessarily behave the same way as humans do in reality. The economist and critic of capitalism Thorstein Veblen claimed that neoclassical economics assumes a person to be &quot;a lightning calculator of pleasures and pains, who oscillates like a homogeneous globule of desire of happiness under the impulse of stimuli that shift about the area, but leave him intact.&quot;

Veblen&#x27;s characterization references a number of commonly criticized rationality assumptions: that people make decisions using a rigid utilitarian framework, have perfect information available about their options, have perfect information processing ability allowing them to immediately calculate utility for all possible options, and are independent decision-makers whose choices are unaffected by their surroundings or by other people. While Veblen is from the Institutional school, the Behavioral school of economics is focused on studying the mechanisms of human decision-making and how they differ from neoclassical assumptions of rationality. Altruistic or empathy-based behavior is another form of &quot;non-rational&quot; decision making studied by behavioral economists, which differs from the neoclassical assumption that people only act in self-interest. Behavioral economists account for how psychological, neurological, and even emotional factors significantly affect economic perceptions and behaviors.

Rational choice theory need not be problematic according to a paper written by the economist Gary Becker which was published in 1962 in the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot; called &quot;Irrational Behavior and Economic Theory&quot;. According to Becker, this paper demonstrates &quot;how the important theorems of modern economics result from a general principle which not only includes rational behavior and survivor arguments as special cases, but also much irrational behavior.&quot; The specific important theorems and results which are shown to result from a broad range of different type of irrational behavior, as well as rational behavior by market participants in the paper, are that market demand curves are downward sloping or &quot;negatively inclined&quot;, and that if an industry transformed from a competitive industry to a completely monopolistic cartel and profits are always maximized, then output per firm under the cartel would decrease compared to its equilibrium level when the industry was competitive.

This paper was largely based on the 1950 paper &quot;Uncertainty, Evolution, and Economic Theory&quot; by Armen Alchian. The paper sets out a justification for supply analysis separate from relying on the assumption of rational consumption, the representative firm and the way neoclassical economists analyze firm behavior in markets which does not rely on rational behavior by the decision makers in those firms, nor any other type of foresighted or goal directed behavior by them. Becker&#x27;s subsequent 1962 paper provides an independent justification for neoclassical market demand analysis. The two papers offer separate justifications for the use of neoclassical methodology for supply and demand analysis without relying on assumptions otherwise criticised as implausible.

=== Methodological individualism ===

Neoclassical economics offers an approach to studying the economic behavior of &quot;homo-economicus&quot;. This theory is based on methodological individualism and adopts an atomistic approach to social phenomena, according to which social atoms are the individuals and their actions. According to this doctrine, individuals are independent of social phenomena, but the opposite is not true. Individuals&#x27; actions can explain macro-scale behavior, and social collections are nothing more than aggregates, and they do not add anything to its components (Ibid). Although methodological individualism does not negate complex social phenomena such as institutions or behavioral rules, it argues any explanation should be based on constituent components&#x27; characteristics of those institutions. This is a reductionist approach based on which it is believed that the characteristics of the social system are derived from the individuals&#x27; preferences and their actions.

A critique of this approach is that the individuals&#x27; preferences and interests are not fixed. The structures contextualize individual&#x27;s. According to social constructivists, systems are co-constituted alongside the actors, and ideas within the system define actors&#x27; identities, their interests, and thus their behavior. In this regard, actors in various circumstances (exposed to different impressions and experiences) will construct their interests and preferences differently, both within each other and over time. Given the individualistic foundation of the economic theory, critics argue that this theory should consider individual action&#x27;s structural contexts.

=== Inequality ===
Neoclassical economics is often criticized as promoting policies that increase inequality and as failing to recognise the impact of inequality on economic outcomes. In the case of the former claim, neoclassical economics is often used for analysis in support of policies reducing economic inequality—in particular through determining the diminishing marginal utility of income, whereby poorer individuals gain greater net benefits from a given increase in income than comparable richer individuals, but more generally by being the primary means by which the impact on inequality of any given policy is assessed. In the case of the latter claim, neoclassical economics is the prevailing lens through which the relationship between inequality and economic outcomes is studied.

=== Ethics of markets ===
Neoclassical economics tends to promote commodification and privatization of goods due to its principle that market exchange generally results in the most effective allocation of goods. For example, some economists support markets for human organs, on the basis that it increases supply of life-saving organs and benefits willing donors financially. However, there are arguments in moral philosophy that use of markets for certain goods is inherently unethical. Political philosopher Michael Sandel summarizes that market exchanges have two ethical problems: coercion and corruption. Coercion happens because market participation may not be as free as proponents often claim: people often participate in markets because it is the only way to survive, which is not truly voluntary. Corruption describes how commodification of a good can inherently degrade its value.

<doc id="21636" wikidata="Q237875" url="?curid=21636" title="Naomi Wolf">
<text>Naomi Rebekah Wolf (born 1962) is an American feminist author, journalist, and conspiracy theorist.

After the 1991 publication of her first book, &quot;The Beauty Myth&quot;, Wolf became a prominent figure in the third wave of the feminist movement. Feminists including Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan praised her work. Others, including Camille Paglia, criticized it. In the 1990s, Wolf was a political advisor to the presidential campaigns of Bill Clinton and Al Gore.

Wolf&#x27;s later books include the bestseller &quot;The End of America&quot; in 2007 and &quot;Vagina: A New Biography&quot;. Critics have challenged the quality and accuracy of her books&#x27; scholarship; her serious misreading of court records for &quot;Outrages&quot; (2019) led to its U.S. publication being canceled. Wolf&#x27;s career in journalism has included topics such as abortion and the Occupy Wall Street movement in articles for media outlets such as &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;.

Since around 2014, Wolf has been described by journalists and media outlets as a conspiracy theorist. She has been criticized for posting misinformation on topics such as beheadings carried out by ISIS, the Western African Ebola virus epidemic, and Edward Snowden.

Wolf has objected to COVID-19 lockdowns and criticized COVID-19 vaccines. In June 2021, her Twitter account was suspended for posting anti-vaccine misinformation.

==Early life and education==
Naomi Rebekah Wolf was born in 1962 in San Francisco, California, to a Jewish family. Her mother is Deborah Goleman Wolf, an anthropologist and the author of &quot;The Lesbian Community&quot;. Her father was Leonard Wolf, a Romanian-born scholar of gothic horror novels, faculty member at San Francisco State University, and Yiddish translator. Leonard Wolf died from Parkinson&#x27;s disease on March 20, 2019. Wolf has a brother, Aaron, and a half-brother, Julius, from her father&#x27;s earlier relationship; it remained a secret until Wolf was in her 30s.

Wolf attended Lowell High School and debated in regional speech tournaments as a member of the Lowell Forensic Society. She attended Yale University, receiving her Bachelor of Arts in English literature in 1984. From 1985 to 1987, she was a Rhodes Scholar at New College, Oxford. Wolf&#x27;s initial period at Oxford University was difficult, as she experienced &quot;raw sexism, overt snobbery and casual antisemitism&quot;. Her writing became so personal and subjective that her tutor advised against submitting her doctoral thesis. Wolf told interviewer Rachel Cooke, writing for &quot;The Observer&quot;, in 2019: &quot;My subject didn&#x27;t exist. I wanted to write feminist theory, and I kept being told by the dons there was no such thing.&quot; Her writing at this time formed the basis of her first book, &quot;The Beauty Myth&quot;.

Wolf ultimately returned to Oxford, completing her Doctor of Philosophy degree in English literature in 2015. Her thesis, supervised by Stefano Evangelista of Trinity College, formed the basis of her 2019 book &quot;Outrages: Sex, Censorship, and the Criminalization of Love&quot;. The thesis (which the journal &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; called &quot;error-strewn&quot;) was subject to significant corrections of its scholarship, prompting several articles in the UK higher education press.

==Political consultant==
Wolf was involved in President Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1996 reelection bid, brainstorming with Clinton&#x27;s team about ways to reach female voters. Hired by Dick Morris, she wanted Morris to promote Clinton as &quot;The Good Father&quot; and a protector of &quot;the American house&quot;. She met with him every few weeks for nearly a year, according to the book Morris wrote about the campaign, &quot;Behind the Oval Office&quot;. Wolf managed to &quot;persuade me to pursue school uniforms, tax breaks for adoption, simpler cross-racial adoption laws and more workplace flexibility.&quot; The advice she gave was without payment, Morris said in November 1999, as Wolf was fearful the knowledge of her involvement in the campaign might have negative consequences for Clinton.

During Al Gore&#x27;s bid for the presidency in the 2000 election, Wolf was hired as a consultant. Her ideas and participation in the campaign generated considerable media coverage. According to a report by Michael Duffy and Karen Tumulty in &quot;Time&quot;, Wolf was paid a salary of $15,000 (by November 1999, $5,000) per month &quot;in exchange for advice on everything from how to win the women&#x27;s vote to shirt-and-tie combinations.&quot; Wolf&#x27;s direct involvement in the &quot;Time&quot; article was unclear; she declined to be interviewed on the record.

In a &quot;New York Times&quot; interview with Melinda Henneberger, Wolf said she had been appointed in January 1999 and denied having advised Gore on his wardrobe. Wolf said she had mentioned the term &quot;alpha male&quot; only once in passing and that it &quot;was just a truism, something the pundits had been saying for months, that the vice president is in a supportive role and the president is in an initiatory role…I used those terms as shorthand in talking about the difference in their job descriptions&quot;. Wolf told Katharine Viner of &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2001: &quot;I believe his agenda for women was a really historic agenda. I was honored to bring the concerns of women to Gore&#x27;s table. I&#x27;m sorry that he didn&#x27;t win and the controversy was worth it for me.&quot; She told Viner the men in Gore&#x27;s campaign, at the equivalent level, were paid more than she was.

==Works==
===&quot;The Beauty Myth&quot; (1991)===

In 1991, Wolf gained international attention as a spokeswoman of third-wave feminism after the publication of her first book, &quot;The Beauty Myth&quot;, an international bestseller. &quot;The New York Times&quot; named it &quot;one of the seventy most influential books of the twentieth century&quot;. She argues that &quot;beauty&quot; as a normative value is entirely socially constructed, and that the patriarchy determines the content of that construction with the objective to maintain women&#x27;s subjugation.

Wolf proposes the concept of an &quot;iron maiden&quot;, an intrinsically unreachable norm that is then used to physically and mentally punish women for failing to achieve and adhere to it. She condemns the fashion and beauty industries for exploiting women, but also writes that the beauty myth pervades all aspects of human life. Wolf believes that women should have &quot;the freedom to do anything we choose with our faces and bodies without being penalized by an ideology that uses attitudes, economic pressure, and even legal judgments about women&#x27;s looks to psychologically and politically destroy us.&quot; She claims that the &quot;beauty myth&quot; has targeted women in five areas: labor, religion, sex, violence, and hunger. Finally, Wolf advocates for a relaxation of conventional beauty norms. In her introduction, she scaffolds her work upon the achievements of second-wave feminists and offers the following analysis:

====Accuracy====
Christina Hoff Sommers criticized Wolf for publishing the estimate that 150,000 women were dying every year from anorexia. Sommers said she traced the source to the American Anorexia and Bulimia Association, which said it was misquoted; the figure refers to sufferers, not fatalities. Wolf&#x27;s citation came from a book by Brumberg, who referred to an American Anorexia and Bulimia Association newsletter and misquoted the newsletter. Wolf acknowledged the error and changed it in future editions. Sommers gave an estimate for the number of fatalities in 1990 as 100–400. The annual anorexia casualties in the U.S. were estimated to be around 50 to 60 per year in the mid-1990s. In 1995, for an article in &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;, British journalist Joan Smith recalled asking Wolf to explain her unsourced assertion in &quot;The Beauty Myth&quot; that the UK &quot;has 3.5 million anorexics or bulimics (95 per cent of them female), with 6,000 new cases yearly&quot;. Wolf replied, according to Smith, that she had calculated the statistics from patients with eating disorders at one clinic.

Caspar Schoemaker of the Netherlands Trimbos Institute published a paper in the academic journal &quot;Eating Disorders&quot; demonstrating that of the 23 statistics cited by Wolf in &quot;Beauty Myth&quot;, 18 were incorrect, with Wolf citing numbers that average out to 8 times the number in the source she was citing.

====Reception====
Second-wave feminist Germaine Greer wrote that &quot;The Beauty Myth&quot; was &quot;the most important feminist publication since &quot;The Female Eunuch&quot; (Greer&#x27;s own work), and Gloria Steinem wrote, &quot;The Beauty Myth&quot; is a smart, angry, insightful book, and a clarion call to freedom. Every woman should read it.&quot; British novelist Fay Weldon called the book &quot;essential reading for the New Woman&quot;. Betty Friedan wrote in &quot;Allure&quot; magazine that &quot;&quot;The Beauty Myth&quot; and the controversy it is eliciting could be a hopeful sign of a new surge of feminist consciousness.&quot;

Camille Paglia, whose &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; was published the same year as &quot;The Beauty Myth&quot;, derided Wolf as unable to perform &quot;historical analysis&quot; and called her education &quot;completely removed from reality&quot;. These comments touched off a series of debates between Wolf and Paglia in the pages of &quot;The New Republic&quot;.

Caryn James wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;:No other work has so forcefully confronted the anti-feminism that emerged during the conservative, yuppified 1980&#x27;s, or so honestly depicted the confusion of accomplished women who feel emotionally and physically tortured by the need to look like movie stars. Even by the standards of pop-cultural feminist studies, &quot;The Beauty Myth&quot; is a mess, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s wrong. James also wrote that the book&#x27;s &quot;claims of an intensified anti-feminism are plausible, but Ms. Wolf doesn&#x27;t begin to prove them because her logic is so lame, her evidence so easily knocked down.&quot; Marilyn Yalom in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the book &quot;persuasive&quot; and praised its &quot;accumulated evidence&quot;.

Revisiting &quot;The Beauty Myth&quot; in 2019 for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, literary critic Maris Kreizman recalls that reading it as an undergraduate made her &quot;world burst open&quot;, but as she matured, Kreizman saw Wolf&#x27;s books as &quot;poorly argued tracts&quot; with Wolf making &quot;wilder and wilder assertions&quot; over time. Kreizman &quot;began to write [Wolf] off as a fringe character&quot; despite the fact that she had &quot;once informed my own feminism so deeply.&quot;

===&quot;Fire with Fire&quot; (1993)===
In &quot;Fire with Fire&quot; (1993), Wolf wrote about politics, female empowerment, and women&#x27;s sexual liberation. She wished to persuade women to reject &quot;victim feminism&quot; in favor of &quot;power feminism&quot;. She argued for diminishing the issue of opposing men, avoiding divisive issues such as abortion and the rights of lesbians, and considering more universal issues like violence against women, pay disparities and sexual harassment. Mary Nemeth wrote in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; that her &quot;central thesis—that when Anita Hill in 1991 accused U.S. Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment she provoked a &#x27;genderquake&#x27; that turned American women into &#x27;the political ruling class&#x27;—seems grossly exaggerated.&quot; Melissa Benn in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; called the book Wolf&#x27;s &quot;call for a realpolitik in which &#x27;sisterhood and capital&#x27; might be allies&quot;.

Michiko Kakutani of &quot;The New York Times&quot; assailed &quot;Fire with Fire&quot; for its &quot;dubious oversimplifications and highly debatable assertions&quot; and its &quot;disconcerting penchant for inflationary prose&quot;, but approved of Wolf&#x27;s &quot;efforts to articulate an accessible, pragmatic feminism, …helping to replace strident dogma with common sense.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine reviewer Martha Duffy dismissed the book as &quot;flawed&quot;, but wrote that Wolf was &quot;an engaging raconteur&quot; who was also &quot;savvy about the role of TV—especially the Thomas-Hill hearings and daytime talk shows—in radicalizing women, including homemakers&quot;, characterizing the book as advocating an inclusive strain of feminism that welcomed abortion opponents. Feminist author Natasha Walter wrote in &quot;The Independent&quot; that the book &quot;has its faults, but compared with &quot;The Beauty Myth&quot; it has energy and spirit, and generosity too.&quot; But Walter criticized it for having a &quot;narrow agenda&quot; where &quot;you will look in vain for much discussion of older women, of black women, of women with low incomes, of mothers.&quot; Calling Wolf a &quot;media star&quot;, Walter wrote: &quot;She is particularly good, naturally, on the role of women in the media.&quot;

===&quot;Promiscuities&quot; (1997)===
&quot;Promiscuities&quot; (1997) reports on and analyzes the shifting patterns of contemporary adolescent sexuality. Wolf argues that literature is rife with examples of male coming-of-age stories, covered autobiographically by D. H. Lawrence, Tobias Wolff, J. D. Salinger, and Ernest Hemingway, and misogynistically by Henry Miller, Philip Roth and Norman Mailer, while female accounts of adolescent sexuality have been systematically suppressed. Schools, in Wolf&#x27;s opinion, should teach their students &quot;sexual gradualism&quot;, masturbation, mutual masturbation and oral sex, which she sees as a more credible approach than total abstinence and without the risks of full intercourse.

Wolf uses cross-cultural material to try to demonstrate that women have, across history, been celebrated as more carnal than men. She also argues that women must reclaim the legitimacy of their sexuality by shattering the polarization of women between virgin and whore. Partly an account of her own sexual history, the book urges women to &quot;redeem the slut in ourselves and rejoice in being bad girls&quot;.

&quot;Promiscuities&quot; generally received negative reviews. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Kakutani wrote that Wolf is &quot;a frustratingly inept messenger: a sloppy thinker and incompetent writer&quot; who &quot;tries in vain to pass off tired observations as radical &quot;aperçus&quot;, subjective musings as generational truths, sappy suggestions as useful ideas&quot;. Of Wolf&#x27;s claims about accounts of female sexuality being suppressed, Kakutani wrote: &quot;Where has Ms. Wolf been? What about the raunchy confessions that surface daily on radio and television talk shows? What about all the memoirists—from Anais Nin to Kathryn Harrison?&quot; Two days earlier in the &quot;Times&quot;, Weaver Courtney praised the book: &quot;Anyone—particularly anyone who, like Ms. Wolf, was born in the 1960s—will have a very hard time putting down &quot;Promiscuities&quot;. Told through a series of confessions, her book is a searing and thoroughly fascinating exploration of the complex wildlife of female sexuality and desire.&quot; In contrast, &quot;The Library Journal&quot; excoriated the book, writing, &quot;Overgeneralization abounds as she attempts to apply the microcosmic events of this mostly white, middle-class, liberal milieu to a whole generation. …There is a desperate defensiveness in the tone of this book which diminishes the force of her argument.&quot;

===&quot;Misconceptions&quot; (2001)===
&quot;I feel absolutely staggered by what I discovered after giving birth&quot;, Wolf said at the time &quot;Misconceptions: Truth, Lies, and the Unexpected on the Journey to Motherhood&quot; was published. &quot;Birth today is like agribusiness. It&#x27;s like a chicken plant: they go in, they go out&quot;, she told Katharine Viner. &quot;Pregnancy, birth and motherhood&quot; has &quot;made me a more radical feminist than I have ever been.&quot; The book draws heavily on Wolf&#x27;s experience of her first pregnancy. She describes the &quot;vacuous impassivity&quot; of the ultrasound technician who gives her the first glimpse of her new baby. Wolf laments her C-section and examines why the procedure is common in the U.S., advocating a return to midwifery. The book&#x27;s second half is anecdotal, focusing on inequalities between parents with respect to child care. In the section describing being on the operating table having a Caesarean, Wolf compares herself to Jesus at his crucifixion. She outlines a &quot;mothers&#x27; manifesto&quot;, including flexi-time for both parents, neighborhood toy banks, and a radical mothers&#x27; movement.

In her &quot;New York Times&quot; review, Claire Dederer wrote that Wolf &quot;barely pauses to acknowledge that Caesareans are, at times, a necessary and even lifesaving intervention&quot; and that she does &quot;her best writing when she&#x27;s observing her own life&quot; as a memoirist, calling Wolf&#x27;s work in this idiom not &quot;self-indulgent. It seems vital, and in a sense radical, in the tradition of 1970&#x27;s feminists who sought to speak to every aspect of women&#x27;s lives.&quot;

===&quot;The Treehouse&quot; (2005)===
Wolf&#x27;s &quot;The Treehouse: Eccentric Wisdom from My Father on How to Live, Love, and See&quot; is an account of her midlife crisis. She revalues her father&#x27;s love, and his role as an artist and a teacher during a year living in a house in upstate New York.

In a promotional interview with &quot;The Herald&quot; (Glasgow), Wolf related her experience of a vision of Jesus: &quot;just this figure who was the most perfected human being – full of light and full of love. …There was light coming out of him holographically, simply because he was unclouded.&quot;

===&quot;The End of America&quot; (2007)===
In &quot;The End of America: Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot&quot;, Wolf takes a historical look at the rise of fascism, outlining 10 steps necessary for a fascist group or government to destroy the democratic character of a nation-state. The book details how this pattern was implemented in Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and elsewhere, and analyzes its emergence and application of all 10 steps in American political affairs since the September 11 attacks. Alex Beam wrote in the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; (reprinted in &quot;The New York Times&quot;): &quot;In the book, Wolf insists that she is not equating [George W.] Bush with Hitler, nor the United States with Nazi Germany, then proceeds to do just that.&quot; A month before the 2008 presidential election, she announced her intention to propose means to arrest Bush. &quot;Americans are facing a coup, as of this morning, October 1st&quot;, she said in a radio interview.

Several years later in 2013, Mark Nuckols argued in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; that Wolf&#x27;s supposed historical parallels between incidents from the era of the European dictators and modern America are based on a highly selective reading in which Wolf omits significant details and misuses her sources. In &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, Michael C. Moynihan called the book &quot;an astoundingly lazy piece of writing.&quot;

&quot;The End of America&quot; was adapted for the screen as a documentary by filmmakers Annie Sundberg and Ricki Stern, best known for &quot;The Devil Came on Horseback&quot; and &quot;The Trials of Darryl Hunt&quot;. It premiered in October 2008, and was favorably reviewed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by Stephen Holden and by &quot;Variety&quot; magazine. Nigel Andrews in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; saw aspects of it positively, but &quot;what isn&#x27;t plausible or reality-related is the conclusion itself. At the door of the Third Reich, Wolf&#x27;s credibility collapses.&quot; Moynihan called it &quot;an even dumber documentary film&quot; than the &quot;dumb book&quot;.

Interviewed by Alternet in 2010, Wolf compared some of President Barack Obama&#x27;s actions to those of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler as typical of dictatorships.

Wolf returned to her &quot;The End of America&quot; theme in a &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; article in 2014, considering how modern Western women, born in inclusive, egalitarian liberal democracies, are assuming positions of leadership in neofascist political movements.

===&quot;Give Me Liberty&quot; (2008)===
&quot;Give Me Liberty: A Handbook for American Revolutionaries&quot; was written as a sequel to &quot;The End of America&quot;. The book looks at times and places in history where citizens faced the closing of an open society and successfully fought back.

===&quot;Vagina: A New Biography&quot; (2012)===
&quot;Vagina: A New Biography&quot; was much criticized, especially by feminist authors. Katie Roiphe called it &quot;ludicrous&quot; in &quot;Slate&quot;: &quot;I doubt the most brilliant novelist in the world could have created a more skewering satire of Naomi Wolf&#x27;s career than her latest book.&quot; In &quot;The Nation&quot;, Katha Pollitt called it a &quot;silly book&quot; containing &quot;much dubious neuroscience and much foolishness.&quot; It becomes &quot;loopier as it goes on. We learn that women think and feel through their vagina, which can &#x27;grieve&#x27; and feel insulted.&quot;

Toni Bentley wrote in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; that Wolf used &quot;shoddy research methodology&quot;, while with &quot;her graceless writing, Wolf opens herself to ridicule on virtually every page.&quot; Janice Turner in &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that since Mary Wollstonecraft, female &quot;writers have argued that women should not be defined by biology&quot;, yet &quot;Wolf, our self-styled leader, has declared that female consciousness, creativity and destiny all come back&quot; to a woman&#x27;s genitals. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; columnist Meghan Daum wrote: &quot;By asserting that what&#x27;s between a woman&#x27;s ears is directly informed by what&#x27;s between her legs—&#x27;the vagina mediates female confidence, creativity and sense of transcendence,&#x27; Wolf writes—it acts as a perverse echo of Republican efforts to limit reproductive rights.&quot; In the book, according to Suzanne Moore in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;feminism becomes simply a highly mediated form of narcissism devoid of any actual brain/politics connection.&quot;

In &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, Zoë Heller wrote that the book &quot;offers an unusually clear insight into the workings of her mystic feminist philosophy&quot;, that the part of the book about the history of the vagina&#x27;s representation is &quot;full of childlike generalizations&quot;, and that Wolf&#x27;s understanding of science &quot;is pretty shaky too&quot;. In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Wolf rejected claims that she had written more freely than her sources could sustain. In &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, Nina Burleigh suggested that critics of the book were so vehement &quot;because (a) their editors handed the book to them for review because they thought it was an Important Feminist Book when it&#x27;s actually slight and (b) there&#x27;s a grain of truth in what she&#x27;s trying to say.&quot;

In response to the criticism, Wolf said in a television interview:

At a party organized to celebrate Wolf&#x27;s publishing deal for this book, the male host invited guests to make pasta pieces shaped like vulvas. Wolf came to view this as mocking, and recounted feeling pressured to remain silent as the butt of a joke, something she said women often feel pressured to do. She said the incident resulted in her having writer&#x27;s block for the next six months.

===&quot;Outrages&quot; (2019)===
Wolf&#x27;s book &quot;Outrages: Sex, Censorship, and the Criminalization of Love&quot; was based on the 2015 doctoral thesis she completed under the supervision of literary scholar Stefano-Maria Evangelista, a Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford. It studies the repression of homosexuality in relation to attitudes toward divorce and prostitution, and also in relation to the censorship of books.

&quot;Outrages&quot; was published in the UK in May 2019 by Virago Press. On June 12, 2019, &quot;Outrages&quot; was named on the &quot;O, The Oprah Magazine&quot;″s &quot;The 32 Best Books by Women of Summer 2019&quot; list. The next day, the U.S. publisher recalled all copies from U.S. bookstores.

In a 2019 BBC radio interview, broadcaster and author Matthew Sweet identified an error in a central tenet of the book: a misunderstanding of the legal term &quot;death recorded&quot;, which Wolf had taken to mean that the convict had been executed but in fact means that the convict was pardoned or the sentence was commuted. He cited a website for the Old Bailey Criminal Court, which Wolf had referred to in the interview as one of her sources. Reviewers have described other errors of scholarship in the work.

At the Hay Festival in Wales in May 2019, a few days after her exchange with Sweet, Wolf defended her book and said she had already corrected the error. At an event in Manhattan in June, she said she was not embarrassed and felt grateful to Sweet for the correction. On October 18, 2019, it became known that Houghton Mifflin Harcourt&#x27;s release of the book in the U.S. was being canceled, with copies already printed and distributed being pulled and pulped. Wolf expressed hope that the book would still be published in the U.S.

In November 2020, Virago published a UK paperback edition of the book that removed the incorrect references to the execution of men for sodomy included in the hardback edition. Interviewed about the new edition, Sweet said that the book continues to misread historical sources: &quot;Dr Wolf has misrepresented the experiences of victims of child abuse and violent sexual assault. This is the most profound offence against her discipline, as well as the memories of real people on the historical record&quot;. Cultural historian Fern Riddell called the book a &quot;calumny against gay people&quot; in the 19th century and said that Wolf &quot;presents child rapists and those taking part in acts of bestiality as being gay men in consensual relationships and that is completely wrong&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that there had been calls for Wolf&#x27;s 2015 DPhil to be reexamined, and for Virago to withdraw the book. In a statement to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Wolf said the book had been reviewed &quot;by leading scholars in the field&quot; and &quot;it is clear that I have accurately represented the position&quot;. Oxford University stated that a &quot;statement of clarification&quot; to Wolf&#x27;s thesis had been received and approved, and would be &quot;available for consultation in the Bodleian Library in due course&quot;.

In March 2021, &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; reported that Wolf&#x27;s original thesis remained unavailable six years after it was examined. Oxford doctoral graduates can request an embargo of up to three years, with the potential for renewal. The thesis finally became available in April 2021, with nine pages of corrections attached dealing with the misreading of historic criminal records. Wolf had submitted the thesis to the archive in December 2020, more than five years after her DPhil was awarded, and had requested a one-year extension to the embargo period so that she could seek legal advice. The extension request was declined.

In university teaching, &quot;Outrages&quot; has been used as an example of the danger of misreading historical sources.

==Feminist issues==
===Abortion===

In an October 1995 &quot;New Republic&quot; article, Wolf was critical of contemporary pro–choice positions, arguing that the movement had &quot;developed a lexicon of dehumanization&quot;, and urged feminists to accept abortion as a form of homicide and defend the procedure within the ambiguity of this moral conundrum. She continued, &quot;Abortion should be legal; it is sometimes even necessary. Sometimes the mother must be able to decide that the fetus, in its full humanity, must die.&quot;

Wolf concluded by speculating that in a world of &quot;real gender equality&quot;, passionate feminists &quot;might well hold candlelight vigils at abortion clinics, standing shoulder to shoulder with the doctors who work there, commemorating and saying goodbye to the dead.&quot; In a 2005 article for &quot;New York&quot; magazine on the subtle manipulation of George W. Bush&#x27;s image among women, Wolf wrote: &quot;Abortion is an issue not of &quot;Ms.&quot; Magazine-style fanaticism or suicidal Republican religious reaction, but a complex issue.&quot;

===Pornography===
In a 2003 &quot;New York&quot; magazine article, Wolf suggested that the ubiquity of internet pornography tends to enervate men&#x27;s sexual attraction to real women. She wrote, &quot;The onslaught of porn is responsible for deadening male libido in relation to real women, and leading men to see fewer and fewer women as &#x27;porn-worthy.&#x27; Far from having to fend off porn-crazed young men, young women are worrying that as mere flesh and blood, they can scarcely get, let alone hold, their attention.&quot; Wolf advocated abstaining from porn not on moral grounds but because &quot;greater supply of the stimulant equals diminished capacity.&quot;

===Women in Islamic countries===
Wolf has commented about the dress required of women living in Muslim countries. In 2008, she wrote in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, &quot;The West interprets veiling as repression of women and suppression of their sexuality. But when I traveled in Muslim countries and was invited to join a discussion in women–only settings within Muslim homes, I learned that Muslim attitudes toward women&#x27;s appearance and sexuality are not rooted in repression, but in a strong sense of public versus private, of what is due to God and what is due to one&#x27;s husband. It is not that Islam suppresses sexuality, but that it embodies a strongly developed sense of its appropriate channeling—toward marriage, the bonds that sustain family life, and the attachment that secures a home.&quot;

==Other views==
===Conspiracy theories===
In the January 2013 issue of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, law and business professor Mark Nuckols wrote: &quot;In her various books, articles, and public speeches, Wolf has demonstrated recurring disregard for the historical record and consistently mutilated the truth with selective and ultimately deceptive use of her sources.&quot; He added: &quot;[W]hen she distorts facts to advance her political agenda, she dishonors the victims of history and poisons present-day public discourse about issues of vital importance to a free society.&quot; Nuckols argued that Wolf &quot;has for many years now been claiming that a fascist coup in America is imminent… [I]n &quot;The Guardian&quot; she alleged, with no substantiation, that the U.S. government and big American banks are conspiring to impose a &#x27;totally integrated corporate-state repression of dissent&#x27;.&quot;

In the same month, Charles C. W. Cooke wrote in &quot;National Review Online&quot; , &quot;Over the last eight years, Naomi Wolf has written hysterically about coups and about vaginas and about little else besides. She has repeatedly insisted that the country is on the verge of martial law, and transmogrified every threat—both pronounced and overhyped—into a government-led plot to establish a dictatorship. She has made prediction after prediction that has simply not come to pass. Hers are not sober and sensible forecasts of runaway human nature, institutional atrophy, and constitutional decline, but psychedelic fever-dreams that are more typically suited to the &quot;InfoWars&quot; crowd.&quot;

Sarah Ditum wrote in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, &quot;Perhaps it&#x27;s not that Wolf is a feminist who&#x27;s degenerated into conspiracism, but instead that she&#x27;s a conspiracy theorist who happened to fall into feminism first. &quot;The Beauty Myth&quot; is a conspiracy theory of a sort, and sometimes conspiracies are real: the self-replicating power structure of patriarchy is one of them.&quot;

===Defense of Julian Assange===

Shortly after Julian Assange was arrested in 2010, Wolf wrote in an article for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; that the allegations two women made against him amounted to no more than bad manners from a boyfriend. His accusers, she later wrote in several contexts, were working for the CIA, and Assange had been falsely accused.

On December 20, 2010, &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; featured a debate between Wolf and Jaclyn Friedman on Assange&#x27;s case. According to Wolf, the alleged victims should have said no, asserted that they consented to having sex with him, and said the claims were politically motivated and demeaned the cause of legitimate rape victims. In a 2011 &quot;Guardian&quot; article, she argued that the accuser in rape cases should not retain anonymity. She said anonymity in such cases was &quot;a relic of the Victorian era&quot; which &quot;serves institutions that do not want to prosecute rapists [...] this is particularly clear in the Assange case, where public opinion matters far more than usual&quot;. In &quot;The Nation&quot;, Katha Pollitt wrote that Wolf&#x27;s argument was that anonymity &quot;impedes law enforcement&quot;, which Pollitt said &quot;is a little bizarre: doesn&#x27;t Wolf realize that anonymity applies only to the media? Everyone in the justice system knows who the complainants are.&quot; Laurie Penny wrote in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; in September 2012 that &quot;Wolf has done great damage by using her platform as one of the world&#x27;s most famous feminists to dismiss these women&#x27;s allegations.&quot;

===Occupy Wall Street===
On October 18, 2011, Wolf was arrested and detained in New York during the Occupy Wall Street protests, having ignored a police warning not to remain on the street in front of a building. She spent about 30 minutes in a cell. She disputed the NYPD&#x27;s interpretation of applicable laws: &quot;I was taken into custody for disobeying an unlawful order. The issue is that I actually know New York City permit law…I didn&#x27;t choose to get myself arrested. I chose to obey the law and that didn&#x27;t protect me.&quot;

A month later, Wolf argued in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, citing leaked documents, that attacks on the Occupy movement were a coordinated plot orchestrated by federal law enforcement agencies. Those leaks, she alleged, showed that the FBI was privately treating OWS as a terrorist threat rather than a peaceful organization. The response to this article ranged from praise to criticism of Wolf for being overly speculative and creating a conspiracy theory. Wolf responded that there was ample evidence for her argument, and proceeded to review the information available to her at the time of the article, and what she alleged was new evidence since that time.

Imani Gandy of Balloon Juice wrote that &quot;nothing substantiates Wolf&#x27;s claims&quot;, that &quot;Wolf&#x27;s article has no factual basis whatsoever and is, therefore, a journalistic failure of the highest order&quot; and that &quot;it was incumbent upon [Wolf] to fully research her claims and to provide facts to back them up.&quot; Corey Robin, a political theorist, journalist, and associate professor of political science at Brooklyn College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, wrote on his blog: &quot;The reason Wolf gets her facts wrong is that she&#x27;s got her theory wrong.&quot;

In a December 2012 &quot;Guardian&quot; article, Wolf wrote about FBI documents released following an FOIA request from the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund revealed that the FBI used counterterrorism agents and other resources to monitor the national Occupy movement extensively. The documents contained no references to agency personnel covertly infiltrating Occupy branches, but did indicate that the FBI gathered information from police departments and other law enforcement agencies relating to planned protests. Additionally, the blog Techdirt reported that the documents disclosed a plot by unnamed parties &quot;to murder OWS leadership in Texas&quot; but that &quot;the FBI never bothered to inform the targets of the threats against their lives.&quot; Wolf wrote:It was more sophisticated than we had imagined: new documents show that the violent crackdown on Occupy last fall [2011]—so mystifying at the time—was not just coordinated at the level of the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and local police. The crackdown, which involved, as you may recall, violent arrests, group disruption, canister missiles to the skulls of protesters, people held in handcuffs so tight they were injured, people held in bondage till they were forced to wet or soil themselves—was coordinated with the big banks themselves.

How simple…just to label an entity a &#x27;terrorist organization&#x27; and choke off, disrupt or indict its sources of financing.

[The FBI crackdown on Occupy] was never really about &#x27;the terrorists&#x27;. It was not even about civil unrest. It was always about this moment, when vast crimes might be uncovered by citizens—it was always, that is to say, meant to be about you.&quot;Mother Jones&quot; claimed that none of the documents revealed efforts by federal law enforcement agencies to disband the Occupy camps, and that the documents did not provide much evidence that federal officials attempted to suppress protesters&#x27; free speech rights. &quot;Mother Jones&quot; said the truth was &quot;a far cry from Wolf&#x27;s contention.&quot;

===Edward Snowden===
In June 2013, &quot;New York&quot; magazine reported that Wolf, in a recent Facebook post, had expressed her &quot;creeping concern&quot; that NSA leaker Edward Snowden &quot;is not who he purports to be, and that the motivations involved in the story may be more complex than they appear to be.&quot; Wolf was similarly skeptical of Snowden&#x27;s &quot;very pretty pole-dancing Facebooking girlfriend who appeared for, well, no reason in the media coverage…and who keeps leaking commentary, so her picture can be recycled in the press.&quot; She wondered whether he was planted by &quot;the Police State&quot;.

Wolf responded on her website: &quot;I do find a great deal of media/blog discussion about serious questions such as those I raised, questions that relate to querying some sources of news stories, and their potential relationship to intelligence agencies or to other agendas that may not coincide with the overt narrative, to be extraordinarily ill-informed and naive.&quot; Of Snowden, she wrote, &quot;Why should it be seen as bizarre to wonder, if there are some potential red flags—the key term is &#x27;wonder&#x27;—if a former NSA spy turned apparent whistleblower might possibly still be—working for the same people he was working for before?&quot;

&quot;Salon&quot; accused Wolf of making factual errors and misreadings.

===Islamic State executions and other assertions===
In a series of Facebook posts in October 2014, Wolf questioned the authenticity of videos purporting to show beheadings of two American journalists and two Britons by the Islamic State, implying that they had been staged by the U.S. government and that the victims and their parents were actors. Wolf also charged that the U.S. was dispatching military troops not to assist in treating the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, but to carry the disease back home to justify a military takeover of the U.S. She further said that the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, in which Scotland voted to remain in the U.K., was faked. Speaking about this at a demonstration in Glasgow on October 12, Wolf said, &quot;I truly believe it was rigged.&quot;

Responding to such criticism, Wolf said, &quot;All the people who are attacking me right now for &#x27;conspiracy theories&#x27; have no idea what they are talking about ... people who assume the dominant narrative MUST BE TRUE and the dominant reasons MUST BE REAL are not experienced in how that world works.&quot; Wolf posted, &quot;I stand by what I wrote.&quot; But in a later Facebook post, she retracted her statement: &quot;I am not asserting that the ISIS videos have been staged&quot;, she wrote.
I certainly sincerely apologize if one of my posts was insensitively worded. I have taken that one down. ... I am not saying the ISIS beheading videos are not authentic. I am not saying they are not records of terrible atrocities. I am saying that they are not yet independently confirmed by two sources as authentic, which any Journalism School teaches, and the single source for several of them, SITE, which received half a million dollars in government funding in 2004, and which is the only source cited for several, has conflicts of interest that should be disclosed to readers of news outlets. Max Fisher commented that &quot;the videos were widely distributed on open-source jihadist online outlets&quot; while the &quot;Maryland-based nonprofit SITE monitors extremist social media.&quot; Wolf deleted her original Facebook posts.

===COVID-19 pandemic===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wolf has frequently promoted COVID-19 misinformation, misinformation related to vaccination and 5G conspiracy theories.

After Joe Biden was elected U.S. president, Wolf tweeted on November 9, 2020: &quot;If I&#x27;d known Biden was open to &#x27;lockdowns&#x27; as he now states, which is something historically unprecedented in any pandemic, and a terrifying practice, one that won&#x27;t ever end because elites love it, I would never have voted for him.&quot; In February 2021, Wolf said on &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; on Fox News that government COVID-19 restrictions were turning the U.S. &quot;into a totalitarian state before everyone&#x27;s eyes&quot;, and went on to say, &quot;I really hope we wake up quickly, because history also shows that it&#x27;s a small window in which people can fight back before it is too dangerous to fight back.&quot;

In a March 2021 interview for Sky News Australia, Wolf claimed that lockdown policies are an &quot;invention&quot; of Chinese leader Xi Jinping. She also said that &quot;Every human right in law is being violated&quot;, that Australians are being &quot;lied to over and over&quot;, and that Australians are being psychologically tortured.

On April 19, 2021, Wolf alleged that National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci, Biden&#x27;s chief medical advisor, &quot;doesn&#x27;t work for us&quot;, asserting he had loyalties to Israel that interfered with service to public health. Wolf pointed to $1 million she said Fauci had received from Israel. It was actually the Dan David Prize, a prestigious private award that Fauci received in 2021 for public service.

Wolf opposes COVID-19 vaccine passports, saying they represent &quot;the absolute end of the line for human liberty in the West.&quot;

Wolf has frequently shared conspiracy theories concerning the safety and efficacy of vaccines against COVID-19. In April 2021, she was instrumental in amplifying and spreading myths that the vaccines cause female infertility. Wolf&#x27;s conspiratorial and anti-vaccine stance has been criticized as irresponsible, and she has also been the subject of ridicule.

Twitter suspended Wolf&#x27;s account in June 2021, a decision the company said was permanent, according to the London &quot;Observer&quot;. At the end of July 2021, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; reported that Wolf was a co-plaintiff in former president Donald Trump&#x27;s social media lawsuit. According to Wolf, Twitter&#x27;s suspension of her account led her to lose &quot;over half of her business model, investors in her business, and other sources of income.&quot;

Wolf appeared on the May 23, 2022, episode of &quot;The Charlie Kirk Show&quot;, where she said: &quot;There are military-age men pouring over the border from places like Afghanistan and Ukraine. And the easiest thing in the world to send them to God knows where, you know, and to arm them to assist the World Health Organization.&quot; She argued that the Second Amendment made it harder for government to subjugate the population, but that it was possible. Wolf said, &quot;I really hope that it doesn&#x27;t devolve into civil war, which is really what the next thing is in history when you have an occupying force, which is what the WHO will be, you know, by next week.&quot;

In an October 2022 interview with UK TV channel GB News, Wolf said that COVID-19 vaccines are part of an effort &quot;to destroy British civil society&quot;. Ofcom, the UK broadcasting regulatory agency, announced an investigation into GB News after receiving more than 400 complaints from members of the public and later found the channel in breach of broadcasting rules.

In January 2023, Wolf appeared with Steve Bannon in his War Room show on Robert J. Sigg&#x27;s Real America&#x27;s Voice television network. They advertised a book titled &quot;Pfizer Documents Analysis Report&quot; that supposedly contained &quot;50 reports using primary source Pfizer documents released under a court order by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&quot;. The authors were not mentioned, but summarized as a team of 3,500 medical experts by the name of &quot;The War Room/DailyClout Pfizer Documents Analysis Project&quot;. According to Wolf and Bannon, the book rips &quot;the veneer off the myth that mRNA injections are safe and effective.&quot;

=== Martin Luther King Jr. ===
On September 7, 2024, Wolf posted to Twitter, &quot;Rev MLK Jr was a convicted felon.&quot; In fact, King&#x27;s only felony indictment was in February 1960, when an Alabama grand jury issued a warrant for his arrest for perjury. He was found not guilty. Wolf&#x27;s false claim was subsequently &quot;fact-checked into oblivion&quot; by Community Notes. Bernice King, Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s youngest child, called Wolf&#x27;s claim an attempt to &quot;assassinate my father&#x27;s character&quot;.

==Personal life==
Wolf&#x27;s first marriage was in 1993 to journalist David Shipley, then an editor at &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The couple had two children, a son and daughter. Wolf and Shipley divorced in 2005.

On November 23, 2018, Wolf married Brian William O&#x27;Shea, a U.S. Army veteran, private detective, and owner of Striker Pierce Investigations. According to a November 2018 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, Wolf and O&#x27;Shea met in 2014 after people threatened Wolf on the internet after she reported on human rights violations in the Middle East, and her contacts recommended O&#x27;Shea.

Wolf is often confused with author Naomi Klein; this confusion is a major subject of Klein&#x27;s 2023 book &quot;Doppelganger&quot;, which Wolf did not contribute to despite numerous attempts by Klein to contact her.

===Alleged &quot;sexual encroachment&quot; incident at Yale===
In a 2004 article for &quot;New York&quot; magazine, Wolf accused literary scholar Harold Bloom of a &quot;sexual encroachment&quot; in 1983 for touching her inner thigh. She said that what she alleged Bloom did was not harassment, either legally or emotionally, and she did not think herself a &quot;victim&quot;, but that she had harbored this secret for 21 years. In a 2015 interview with &quot;Time&quot;, Bloom denied ever being indoors with &quot;this person&quot;. Explaining why she had finally gone public with the charges, Wolf wrote:

I began, nearly a year ago, to try—privately—to start a conversation with my alma mater that would reassure me that steps had been taken in the ensuing years to ensure that unwanted sexual advances of this sort weren&#x27;t still occurring. I expected Yale to be responsive. After nine months and many calls and e-mails, I was shocked to conclude that the atmosphere of collusion that had helped to keep me quiet twenty years ago was still intact—as secretive as a Masonic lodge. Sexual encroachment in an educational context or a workplace is, most seriously, a corruption of meritocracy; it is in this sense parallel to bribery. I was not traumatized personally, but my educational experience was corrupted. If we rephrase sexual transgression in school and work as a civil-rights and civil-society issue, everything becomes less emotional, less personal. If we see this as a systemic corruption issue, then when people bring allegations, the focus will be on whether the institution has been damaged in its larger mission.

In &quot;Slate&quot; magazine around the time the allegations against Bloom first surfaced, Meghan O&#x27;Rourke wrote that Wolf generalized about sexual assault at Yale on the basis of her alleged personal experience. Moreover, O&#x27;Rourke wrote, despite Wolf&#x27;s assertion that sexual assault existed at Yale, she did not interview any Yale students for her story. In addition, O&#x27;Rourke wrote, &quot;She jumps through verbal hoops to make it clear she was not &#x27;personally traumatized,&#x27; yet she spends paragraphs describing the incident in precisely those terms.&quot; O&#x27;Rourke wrote that, despite Wolf&#x27;s claim that her educational experience was corrupted, Wolf &quot;neglects to mention that she later was awarded a Rhodes [scholarship].&quot; O&#x27;Rourke concluded that the &quot;gaps and imprecision&quot; in Wolf&#x27;s article &quot;give fodder to skeptics who think sexual harassment charges are often just a form of hysteria.&quot;

Separately, a formal complaint was filed with the US Department of Education Office for Civil Rights on March 15, 2011, by 16 current and former Yale students—12 female and 4 male—describing a sexually hostile environment at Yale. A federal investigation of Yale University began in March 2011 in response to the complaints. In April, Wolf said on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Early Show&quot;, &quot;Yale has been systematically covering up much more serious crimes than the ones that can be easily identified.&quot; More specifically, she alleged &quot;they use the sexual harassment grievance procedure in a very cynical way, purporting to be supporting victims, but actually using a process to stonewall victims, to isolate them, and to protect the university.&quot; Yale settled the federal complaint in June 2012, acknowledging &quot;inadequacies&quot; but not facing &quot;disciplinary action with the understanding that it keeps in place policy changes instituted after the complaint was filed. The school [was] required to report on its progress to the Office of Civil Rights until May, 2014.&quot;

In January 2018, Wolf accused Yale officials of blocking her from filing a formal grievance against Bloom. She told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that she had attempted to file the complaint in 2015 with Yale&#x27;s University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct, but that the university had refused to accept it. On January 16, 2018, Wolf said, she determined to see Yale&#x27;s provost, Ben Polak, in another attempt to present her case. &quot;As she documented on Twitter,&quot; the newspaper reported, &quot;she brought a suitcase and a sleeping bag, because she said she did not know how long she would have to stay. When she arrived at the provost&#x27;s office, she said, security guards prevented her from entering any elevators. Eventually, she said, Aley Menon, the secretary of the sexual misconduct committee, appeared and they met in the committee&#x27;s offices for an hour, during which she gave Ms. Menon a copy of her complaint.&quot; This was reported and confirmed by Norman Vanamee, who apparently met Wolf at Yale that morning. In &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; magazine in January 2018, Vanamee returned to the story and wrote, &quot;Yale University has a 93-person police department, and, after the guard called for backup, three of its armed and uniformed officers appeared and stationed themselves between Wolf and the elevator bank.&quot;

<text>The New Year is the time or day at which a new calendar year begins and the calendar&#x27;s year count increments by one. Many cultures celebrate the event in some manner. In the Gregorian calendar, the most widely used calendar system today, New Year occurs on January 1 (New Year&#x27;s Day, preceded by New Year&#x27;s Eve). This was also the first day of the year in the original Julian calendar and the Roman calendar (after 153 BC).

Other cultures observe their traditional or religious New Year&#x27;s Day according to their own customs, typically (though not invariably) because they use a lunar calendar or a lunisolar calendar. Chinese New Year, the Islamic New Year, Tamil New Year (Puthandu), and the Jewish New Year are among well-known examples. India, Nepal, and other countries also celebrate New Year on dates according to their own calendars that are movable in the Gregorian calendar.

During the Middle Ages in Western Europe, while the Julian calendar was still in use, authorities moved New Year&#x27;s Day, depending upon locale, to one of several other days, including March 1, March 25, Easter, September 1, and December 25. Since then, many national civil calendars in the Western World and beyond have changed to using one fixed date for New Year&#x27;s Day, January 1most doing so when they adopted the Gregorian calendar.

==By type==
Based on the used calendar new years are often categorized between lunar or lunisolar new years or solar new years.

==By month or season==

===January===

*January 1: The first day of the civil year in the Gregorian calendar used by most countries.
**Contrary to common belief in the west, the civil New Year of January 1 is not an Orthodox Christian religious holiday. The Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar makes no provision for the observance of a New Year. January 1 is itself a religious holiday, but that is because it is the feast of the circumcision of Christ (seven days after His birth), and a commemoration of saints. While the liturgical calendar begins September 1, there is also no particular religious observance attached to the start of the new cycle. Orthodox nations may, however, make civil celebrations for the New Year. Those who adhere to the revised Julian calendar (which synchronizes dates with the Gregorian calendar), including Bulgaria, Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, Romania, Syria, Turkey and Ukraine, observe both the religious and civil holidays on January 1. In other nations and locations where Orthodox churches still adhere to the Julian calendar, including Georgia, Israel, Russia, the Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro and Russian-occupied Ukraine, the civil new year is observed on January 1 of the civil calendar, while those same religious feasts occur on January 14 Gregorian (which is January 1 Julian), in accord with the liturgical calendar.
*The Japanese New Year (正月, Shōgatsu) is currently celebrated on January 1, with the holiday usually being observed until January 3, while other sources say that Shōgatsu lasts until January 6. In 1873, five years after the Meiji Restoration, Japan adopted the Gregorian calendar. Prior to 1873, Japan used a lunar calendar with twelve months each of 29 or 30 days for a total year of about 354 days.
*The Sámi celebrated Ođđajagemánnu.

===Winter lunisolar new years ===

Lunisolar calendars count months according to lunations but, because there are not an even number of lunar cycles in a solar year, the calendar must be restarted annually on the first, second or even third new moon after the winter solstice. (The term &quot;lunar calendar&quot; is often used of lunisolar calendars, but true lunar calendars (such as the Islamic calendar) count only lunations and ignore the solar seasons.)
*The Chinese New Year, also known as Spring Festival or Lunar New Year, occurs every year on the new moon of the first lunar month, about the beginning of spring (Lichun). The exact date can fall any time between January 21 and February 21 (inclusive) of the Gregorian Calendar. Traditionally, years were marked by one of twelve Earthly Branches, represented by an animal, and one of ten Heavenly Stems, which correspond to the five elements. This combination cycles every 60 years. It is the most important Chinese celebration of the year.
*The Korean New Year is a Seollal or Lunar New Year&#x27;s Day. Although January 1 is, in fact, the first day of the year, Seollal, the first day of the lunar calendar, is more meaningful for Koreans. A celebration of the Lunar New Year is believed to have started to let in good luck and ward off bad spirits all throughout the year. With the old year out and a new one in, people gather at home and sit around with their families and relatives, catching up on what they have been doing.
*The Vietnamese New Year is the Tết Nguyên Đán which most times is the same day as the Chinese New Year due to the Vietnamese using a lunisolar calendar similar to the Chinese calendar.
*The Tibetan New Year is Losar and falls between January and March.
*The Taiwanese New Year is called Kuè-nî and falls between January and March.

===March===
*Babylonian New Year began with the first New Moon after the northward equinox. Ancient celebrations lasted for eleven days.
*Nava Varsha is celebrated in India in various regions from March–April.
*The Iranian New Year, called Nowruz, is the day containing the exact moment of the Northward equinox, which usually occurs on March 20 or 21, marking the start of the spring season. The Zoroastrian New Year coincides with the Iranian New Year of Nowruz and is celebrated by the Parsis in India and by Zoroastrians and Persians across the world. In the Baháʼí calendar, the new year occurs on the vernal equinox on March 20 or 21 and is called Naw-Rúz. The Iranian tradition was also passed on to Central Asian countries, including Kazakhs, Uzbeks, and Uighurs, and there is known as Nauryz. It is usually celebrated on March 22.
*The Balinese New Year, based on the Saka Calendar (Balinese-Javanese Calendar), is called Nyepi, and it falls on Bali&#x27;s Lunar New Year (around March). It is a day of silence, fasting, and meditation: observed from 6 am until 6 am the next morning, Nyepi is a day reserved for self-reflection and as such, anything that might interfere with that purpose is restricted. Although Nyepi is a primarily Hindu holiday, non-Hindu residents of Bali observe the day of silence as well, out of respect for their fellow citizens. Even tourists are not exempt; although free to do as they wish inside their hotels, no one is allowed onto the beaches or streets, and the only airport in Bali remains closed for the entire day. The only exceptions granted are for emergency vehicles carrying those with life-threatening conditions and women about to give birth.
*Ugadi (, ); the Telugu and Kannada New Year, generally falls in the months of March or April. The people of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka states in southern India celebrate the advent of New Year&#x27;s Day in these months. The first month of the new year is Chaitra Masa.
*In the Kashmiri calendar, the holiday Navreh marks the New Year in March–April. This holy day of Kashmiri Brahmins has been celebrated for several millennia.
*Gudi Padwa is celebrated as the first day of the Hindu year by the people of Maharashtra, India and Sanskar Padwa is celebrated in Goa. This day falls in March–April and coincides with Ugadi. (see: Deccan)
*The Sindhi festival of Cheti Chand is celebrated on the same day as Ugadi/Gudi Padwa to mark the celebration of the Sindhi New Year.
*The Thelemic New Year on March 20 (or on April 8 by some accounts) is usually celebrated with an invocation to Ra-Hoor-Khuit, commemorating the beginning of the New Aeon in 1904. It also marks the start of the twenty-two-day Thelemic holy season, which ends on the third day of the writing of The Book of the Law. This date is also known as The Feast of the Supreme Ritual. There are some that believe the Thelemic New Year falls on either March 19, 20, or 21, depending on the vernal equinox, which is The Feast for the Equinox of the Gods on the vernal equinox of each year to commemorate the founding of Thelema in 1904. In 1904 the vernal equinox was on March 21, and it was the day after Aleister Crowley ended his Horus Invocation that brought on the new Æon and Thelemic New Year.

===April===
*The Assyrian-Babylonian New Year, called Kha b&#x27;Nissan or Resha d&#x27;Sheeta, occurs on April 1.
*Thelemic New Year Celebrations usually end on April 10, after an approximately one-month-long period that begins on March 20 (the formal New Year). This one-month period is referred to by many as the High Holy Days, and end with periods of observance on April 8, 9, and 10, coinciding with the three days of the Writing of the Book of the Law by Aleister Crowley in 1904.

===Mid-April (Spring in the Northern Hemisphere)===

The new year of many South and Southeast Asian calendars falls between April 13–15, marking the beginning of spring.
*The Baloch Hindu people in Pakistan and India celebrate their new year called Bege Roch in the month of Daardans according to their Saaldar calendar.
*Tamil New Year ( &quot;Puthandu&quot;) is celebrated in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, on the first of &quot;Chithrai&quot; (சித்திரை) (April 13, 14, or 15). In the temple city of Madurai, the Chithrai Thiruvizha is celebrated in the Meenakshi Temple. A huge exhibition is also held, called Chithrai Porutkaatchi. In some parts of Southern Tamil Nadu, it is also called Chithrai Vishu. The day is marked with a feast in Hindu homes and the entrance to the houses are decorated elaborately with kolams.
*Punjabi/Sikh Vaisakhi (ਵਿਸਾਖੀ) is celebrated on April 14 in Punjab according to their nanakshahi calendar.
*Nepal New Year in Nepal is celebrated on the 1st of Baisakh &quot;Baisākh&quot; which falls on 12–15 April in the Gregorian calendar. Nepal follows the Bikram Sambat (BS) as an official calendar.
*The Dogra of Himachal Pradesh celebrate their new year Chaitti in the month of Chaitra.
*Maithili New Year or Jude-Sheetal too fall on these days. It is celebrated by Maithili People all around the world.
*Assamese New Year (&quot;Rongali Bihu&quot; or &quot;Bohag Bihu&quot;) is celebrated on April 14 or 15 in the Indian state of Assam.
*Bengali New Year ( &quot;Pôhela Boishakh&quot; or &quot;Bangla Nôbobôrsho&quot;) is celebrated on the 1st of Boishakh (April 14 or 15) in Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal and Tripura.
*Odia New Year (&quot;Vishuva Sankranti&quot;) is celebrated on April 14 in the Indian state of Odisha. It is also called Vishuva Sankranti or Pana Sankranti (ପଣା ସଂକ୍ରାନ୍ତି).
*Manipuri New Year or Cheirouba is celebrated on April 14 in the Indian State of Manipur with much festivities and feasting.
*Sinhalese New Year is celebrated with the harvest festival (in the month of Bak) when the sun moves from the Meena Rashiya (House of Pisces) to the Mesha Rashiya (House of Aries). Sri Lankans begin celebrating their National New Year &quot;Aluth Avurudda (අලුත් අවුරුද්ද)&quot; in Sinhala and &quot;Puththandu (புத்தாண்டு)&quot; in Tamil. However, unlike the usual practice where the new year begins at midnight, the National New Year begins at the time determined by the astrologers by calculating the exact time that sun goes from Meena Rashiya (House of Pisces) to the Mesha Rashiya (House of Aries). Not only the beginning of the new year but the conclusion of the old year is also specified by the astrologers. And unlike the customary ending and beginning of the new year, there is a period of a few hours in between the conclusion of the Old Year and the commencement of the New Year, which is called the &quot;nona gathe&quot; (neutral period) Where part of the sun in House of Pisces and Part is in House of Aries.
*Malayali New Year (, &quot;Vishu&quot;) is celebrated in the South Indian state of Kerala in mid-April.
*Western parts of Karnataka where Tulu is spoken, the new year is celebrated along with Tamil/ Malayali New year April 14 or 15, although in other parts most commonly celebrated on the day of Gudi Padwa, the Maharashtrian new year. In Kodagu, in Southwestern Karnataka, however, both new year, Yugadi (corresponding to Gudi Padwa in March) and Bisu (corresponding to Vishu in around April 14 or 15), are observed.
*The Water Festival is the form of similar new year celebrations taking place in many Southeast Asian countries, on the day of the full moon of the 11th month on the lunisolar calendar each year. The date of the festival is based on the traditional lunisolar calendar which determines the dates of Buddhist festivals and holidays, and is observed from April 13 to 15. Traditionally people gently sprinkled water on one another as a sign of respect, but since the new year falls during the hottest month in Southeast Asia, many people end up dousing strangers and passersby in vehicles in boisterous celebration. The festival has many different names specific to each country:
**In Burma it is known as &quot;Thingyan&quot; ()
** Songkran () in Thailand
** &quot;Pi Mai Lao&quot; ( &quot;Songkan&quot;) in Laos
** &quot;Chaul Chnam Thmey&quot; ( ) in Cambodia.
** It is also the traditional new year of the Dai peoples of Yunnan Province, China. Religious activities in the tradition of Theravada Buddhism are also carried out, a tradition in which all of these cultures share.

===June===
* The New Year of the Kutchi people occurs on &quot;Ashadi Beej&quot;, that is 2nd day of Shukla paksha of Aashaadha month of Hindu calendar. As for people of Kutch, this day is associated with the beginning of rains in Kutch, which is largely a desert area. Hindu calendar month of Aashaadh usually begins on June 22 and ending on July 22.
* Odunde Festival is a celebration on the 2nd Sunday of June, where &quot;Odunde&quot; means &quot;Happy New Year&quot; in the Yorube Nigerian language.
*The Xooy ceremony of the Serer people of Senegal, Gambia and Mauritania marks the Serer New Year.
*In the Dogon religion, the &quot;Bulo&quot; festival marks the Dogon New Year.

===July===
* The New Year of the Zulu people occurs on the full moon of July.

===September===
* Neyrouz, the Coptic New Year, is the continuation of the ancient Egyptian New Year following the Roman emperor Augustus&#x27;s reform of its calendar. Its date of Thoth 1 usually occurs on August 29 in the Julian calendar, except in the year before a Julian leap year, when it occurs the next day. The leap years removed from the Gregorian calendar mean that it presently falls on September 11 or 12 but on different days before 1900 or after 2100.
* Enkutatash, the Ethiopian New Year, occurs on the same day as Neyrouz.
* The New Year of the French Revolutionary Calendar, in force from 1793 to 1805 and briefly under the Paris Commune in 1871, occurred on the Southward equinox (22, 23, or 24 September)

===Autumn in the Northern Hemisphere===
*Rosh Hashanah (Hebrew for &#x27;head of the year&#x27;) is a Jewish, two day holiday, commemorating the culmination of the seven days of Creation, and marking God&#x27;s yearly renewal of His world. The day has elements of festivity and introspection, as God is traditionally believed to be assessing His creation and determining the fate of all men and creatures for the coming year. In Jewish tradition, honey is used to symbolize a sweet new year. At the traditional meal for that holiday, apple slices are dipped in honey and eaten with blessings recited for a good, sweet new year. Some Rosh Hashanah greetings show honey and an apple, symbolizing the feast. In some congregations, small straws of honey are given out to usher in the new year.
*The Pathans Kalasha celebrate their Chowmus which marks the beginning of their year in Chitral district of Pakistan and parts of India.
*The Marwari New Year (Thapna) is celebrated on the day of the festival of Diwali, which is the last day Krishna Paksha of the Ashvin month &amp; also the last day of the Ashvin month of the Hindu calendar.
*The Gujarati New Year (Bestu/Nao Varas) is celebrated the day after the festival of Diwali (which occurs in mid-fall – either October or November, depending on the Lunar calendar). The Gujarati New Year is synonymous with &quot;sud ekam&quot;, i.e. first day of Shukla paksha of the &quot;Kartik&quot; month, which is taken as the first day of the first month of the Gujarati lunar calendar. Most other Hindus celebrate the New Year in early spring. The Gujarati community all over the world celebrates the New Year after Diwali to mark the beginning of a new fiscal year.
*The Sikkimese celebrate their new year called Losar.
*The Nepal Era New year (see Nepal Sambat) is celebrated in regions encompassing original Nepal. The new year occurs on the fourth day of Diwali. The calendar was used as an official calendar until the mid-19th century. However, the new year is still celebrated by the Newars community of Nepal.
*Some neo-pagans celebrate their interpretation of Samhain (a festival of the ancient Celts, held around November 1) as a New Year&#x27;s Day representing the new cycle of the Wheel of the Year, although they do not use a different calendar that starts on this day.

=== December ===
* The Mizo in northeast India celebrate their Pawl Kut in December.
* The Inuit, the Aleut, the Yupik, the Chukchi and the Iñupiat celebrate Quviasukvik () as their New Year. It occurs on the same day as Christmas Eve.

===Variable===

* The Islamic New Year occurs on Muharram. Since the Islamic calendar is based on 12 lunar months amounting to about 354 days, its New Year occurs about eleven days earlier each year in relation to the Gregorian calendar, with two Islamic New Years falling in the Gregorian year 2008.
* Satu Suro is the Javanese New Year, which falls on the first day of the month of &quot;Suro&quot; and corresponds with the first Islamic month of Muharram. Most Javanese in Java, Indonesia celebrated it by staying at home and refrain leaving the house. 
* The &quot;Opening of the Year&quot; (; &quot;&quot;), usually transcribed as Wep Renpet, was the ancient Egyptian New Year. It appears to have originally been set to occur upon Sirius&#x27;s return to the night sky (July 19 proleptic Julian calendar), during the initial stages of former annual flood of the Nile. However the Egyptian calendar&#x27;s lack of leap years, until its reform by the Roman emperor Augustus, meant that the celebration slowly cycled through the entire solar year over the course of two or three 1460-year Sothic cycles.

==Christian liturgical year==

The early development of the Christian liturgical year coincided with the Roman Empire (east and west), and later the Byzantine Empire, both of which employed a taxation system labeled the Indiction, the years for which began on September 1. This timing may account for the ancient church&#x27;s establishment of September 1 as the beginning of the liturgical year, despite the official Roman New Year&#x27;s Day of January 1 in the Julian calendar, because the Indiction was the principal means for counting years in the empires, apart from the reigns of the Emperors. The September 1 date prevailed throughout all of Christendom for many centuries, until subsequent divisions eventually produced revisions in some places.

After the sack of Rome in 410, communications and travel between east and west deteriorated. Liturgical developments in Rome and Constantinople did not always match, although a rigid adherence to form was never mandated in the church. Nevertheless, the principal points of development were maintained between east and west. The Roman and Constantinopolitan liturgical calendars remained compatible even after the East-West Schism in 1054. Separations between the Catholic General Roman Calendar and Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar grew only over several centuries&#x27; time. During those intervening centuries, the Latin Church Catholic ecclesiastic year was moved to the first day of Advent, the Sunday nearest to St. Andrew&#x27;s Day (November 30). By the time of the Reformation (early 16th century), the Roman Catholic general calendar provided the initial basis for the calendars for the liturgically oriented Protestants, including the Anglican and Lutheran Churches, who inherited this observation of the liturgical new year.

The present-day Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar is the virtual culmination of the ancient eastern development cycle, though it includes later additions based on subsequent history and lives of saints. It still begins on September 1, proceeding annually into the Nativity of the Theotokos (September 8) and Exaltation of the Cross (September 14) to the celebration of Nativity of Christ (Christmas), through his death and resurrection (Pascha/Easter), to his Ascension and the Dormition of the Theotokos (&quot;falling asleep&quot; of the Virgin Mary, August 15). This last feast is known in the Roman Catholic church as the Assumption. The dating of &quot;September 1&quot; is according to the &quot;new&quot; (revised) Julian calendar or the &quot;old&quot; (standard) Julian calendar, depending on which is used by a particular Orthodox Church. Hence, it may fall on September 1 on the civil calendar, or on September 14 (between 1900 and 2099 inclusive).

The liturgical calendars of the Coptic and Ethiopian Orthodox churches are unrelated to these systems but instead follow the Alexandrian calendar which fixed the wandering ancient Egyptian calendar to the Julian year. Their New Year celebrations on Neyrouz and Enkutatash were fixed; however, at a point in the Sothic cycle close to the Indiction; between the years 1900 and 2100, they fall on September 11 during most years and September 12 in the years preceding a leap year.

==Historical European new year dates==
During the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, years began on the date on which each consul first entered the office. This was probably May 1 before 222 BC, March 15 from 222 BC to 154 BC, and January 1 from 153 BC. In 45 BC, when Julius Caesar&#x27;s new Julian calendar took effect, the Senate fixed January 1 as the first day of the year. At that time, this was the date on which those who were to hold civil office assumed their official position, and it was also the traditional annual date for the convening of the Roman Senate. This civil new year remained in effect throughout the Roman Empire, east and west, during its lifetime and well after, wherever the Julian calendar continued in use.

In the Middle Ages in Europe a number of significant feast days in the ecclesiastical calendar of the Roman Catholic Church came to be used as the beginning of the Julian year:

* In &quot;Modern Style&quot; or &quot;Circumcision Style&quot; dating, the new year started on January 1, the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ.
* In &quot;Annunciation Style&quot; or &quot;Lady Day Style&quot; dating the new year started on March 25, the feast of the Annunciation (traditionally nicknamed Lady Day). This date was used in many parts of Europe during the Middle Ages and beyond.
* In &quot;Easter Style&quot; dating, the new year started on Holy Saturday (the day before Easter), or sometimes on Good Friday. This was used all over Europe, but especially in France, from the eleventh to the sixteenth century. A disadvantage of this system was that because Easter was a movable feast the same date could occur twice in a year; the two occurrences were distinguished as &quot;before Easter&quot; and &quot;after Easter&quot;.
* In &quot;Christmas Style&quot; or &quot;Nativity Style&quot; dating the new year started on December 25. This was used in Germany and England until the eleventh century, and in Spain from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century.

Over the centuries, countries changed between styles until the Modern Style (January 1) prevailed. For example,
* In England and Ireland, either Annunciation Style (March 25) or Nativity Style (December 25th) was used until the Norman Conquest in 1066, when Modern Style (January 1) was adopted; but Annunciation Style was used again from 1155.
* Scotland changed from Annunciation Style (March 25) to Modern Style with effect from January 1, 1600 (by Order of the King&#x27;s Privy Council on December 17, 1599). 
* Despite the unification of the Scottish and English royal crowns with the accession of King James VI and I in 1603, and even the union of the kingdoms themselves in 1707, England continued using Annunciation Style while Scotland used Modern Style.
* The final change came when Parliament passed the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750. This act had two major elements: it converted all parts of the British Empire to use of the Gregorian calendar and simultaneously it declared the civil new year in England, Wales, Ireland and the Colonies to be January 1 (as was already the case in Scotland). It went into effect on 3 September (Old Style) or 14September (New Style) 1752.

A more unusual case is France, which observed the Northern autumn equinox day (usually September 22) as &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot; in the French Republican Calendar, which was in use from 1793 to 1805. This was &quot;primidi Vendémiaire&quot;, the first day of the first month.

==Adoptions of January 1==

It took quite a long time before January 1 again became the universal or standard start of the civil year. The years of adoption of January 1 as the new year are as follows:

March 1 was the first day of the numbered year in the Republic of Venice until its destruction in 1797, and in Russia from 988 until 1492 (Anno Mundi 7000 in the Byzantine calendar). September 1 was used in Russia from 1492 (A.M. 7000) until the adoption of both the Anno Domini notation and 1 January as New Year&#x27;s Day, with effect from 1700, via December 1699 decrees (1735, 1736) of Tsar Peter I.

==Time zones==
Because of the division of the globe into time zones, the new year moves progressively around the globe as the start of the day ushers in the New Year. The first time zone to usher in the New Year, just west of the International Date Line, is located in the Line Islands, a part of the nation of Kiribati, and has a time zone 14 hours ahead of UTC. All other time zones are 1 to 25 hours behind, most in the previous day (December 31); on American Samoa and Midway, it is still 11 pm on December 30. These are among the last inhabited places to observe New Year. However, uninhabited outlying US territories Howland Island and Baker Island are designated as lying within the time zone 12 hours behind UTC, the last places on Earth to see the arrival of January 1. These small coral islands are found about midway between Hawaii and Australia, about 1,000 miles west of the Line Islands. This is because the International Date Line is a composite of local time zone arrangements, which winds through the Pacific Ocean, allowing each locale to remain most closely connected in time with the nearest or largest or most convenient political and economic locales with which each associate. By the time Howland Island sees the new year, it is 2 am on January 2 in the Line Islands of Kiribati.

<text>The Northern Territory (abbreviated as NT; known formally as the Northern Territory of Australia and informally as the Territory) is an Australian internal territory in the central and central-northern regions of Australia. The Northern Territory shares its borders with Western Australia to the west (129th meridian east), South Australia to the south (26th parallel south), and Queensland to the east (138th meridian east). To the north, the Northern Territory looks out to the Timor Sea, the Arafura Sea, and the Gulf of Carpentaria, including Western New Guinea and various other islands of the Indonesian archipelago.

The NT covers , making it the third-largest Australian federal division, and the 11th-largest country subdivision in the world. It is sparsely populated, with a population of only 249,000 – fewer than half as many people as in Tasmania. The largest population centre is the capital city of Darwin, having about 52.6% of the Territory&#x27;s population. The largest inland settlement is Alice Springs with a population of about 25,000 people.

The archaeological history of the Northern Territory may have begun more than 60,000 years ago when humans first settled this region of the Sahul Continent. From at least the 18th century, Makassan traders began a relationship with the indigenous people of the Northern Territory around the trading of trepang. The coast of the Territory was first seen by Europeans in the 17th century. The British were the first Europeans to attempt to settle the coastal regions. After three failed attempts to establish a settlement (1824–1828, 1838–1849, and 1864–1866), success was achieved in 1869 with the establishment of a settlement at Port Darwin.

The economy is based largely on mining and petroleum, which during 2018–2019 contributed 23% of the gross state product, or $5.68 billion, accounting for 92.4% of exports.

The Territory&#x27;s population is concentrated in coastal regions and along the Stuart Highway. Besides the capital of Darwin, the major settlements are (in order of size) Palmerston, Alice Springs, Katherine, Nhulunbuy and Tennant Creek. Residents of the Northern Territory are often known as &quot;Territorians&quot;.

==History==

===Pre-colonial===

Humans have lived in the present area of the Northern Territory since at least 48,400 to 68,700 years ago.

From the 17th or 18th century AD onwards, traders from Sulawesi established extensive seasonal trade links with the Indigenous peoples of Kimberley region, the modern-day Northern Territory, and Arnhem Land. They collected &quot;trepang&quot; (sea cucumber) for Chinese markets and introduced several goods and technologies to the Indigenous peoples. There is significant evidence of contact with Makassan fishers in examples of Indigenous Australian rock art and bark painting of northern Australia, with the Makassan &quot;perahu&quot; a prominent feature.
===Colonial administration===
With the coming of the British, there were four early attempts to settle the harsh environment of the northern coast, of which three failed in starvation and despair. The land now occupied by the Northern Territory was part of colonial New South Wales from 1825 to 1863, except for a brief time from February to December 1846, when it was part of the short-lived colony of North Australia. The Northern Territory was part of South Australia from 1863 to 1911, and under its administration the Overland Telegraph Line was constructed between 1870 and 1872.

From its establishment in 1869, the Port of Darwin was the major supply point for the Territory for many decades.

A railway was built between Palmerston and Pine Creek between 1883 and 1889 as part of the North Australia Railway. The economic pattern of cattle raising and mining was established so that by 1911 there were 513,000 cattle. Victoria River Downs Station, west of Darwin, was at one time the largest cattle station in the world. 

Gold was found at Grove Hill in 1872 and at Pine Creek (in 1871), Brocks Creek, Burundi, and copper was found at Daly River.

===Federal territory===
On 1 January 1911, a decade after Federation, the Northern Territory was separated from South Australia, alongside the Australian Capital Territory from NSW, and transferred to federal control. Alfred Deakin opined at this time &quot;[t]o me the question has been not so much commercial as national, first, second, third and last. Either we must accomplish the peopling of the northern territory or submit to its transfer to some other nation.&quot;

In late 1912 there was growing sentiment that the name &quot;Northern Territory&quot; was unsatisfactory. The names &quot;Kingsland&quot; (after King George V and to correspond with Queensland), &quot;Centralia&quot; and &quot;Territoria&quot; were proposed with Kingsland becoming the preferred choice in 1913. However, the name change never went ahead.

====Division into North Australia and Central Australia====
For a brief time between 1927 and 1931 the Northern Territory was divided into North Australia and Central Australia at the 20th parallel of South latitude. Soon after this time, parts of the Northern Territory were considered in the Kimberley Plan as a possible site for the establishment of a Jewish Homeland, understandably considered the &quot;Unpromised Land&quot;.

During the early 20th century, the southern part of the Territory was considered the &quot;last frontier&quot; of Australian settlement, where &#x27;sympathetic whites&#x27; hoped that Aboriginal traditions would continue to be practised. Conflicts arose due to the resource scarcity and the fragility of the cattle industry and the area was rife with Indigenous &#x27;bush bandits&#x27; who speared cattle for food for want of employment by ranchers. This was exacerbated by a drought between 1925 and 1929 that led to the deaths of 85 per cent of the children at the Hermannsburg Mission in Central Australia. In the meantime, white attitudes towards Aboriginal people were paternalistic, torn between the desire to help them in times of hunger and the fear of &quot;pauperizing&quot; them and reducing their incentives to work. 

In the 1928 Coniston massacre, punitive expeditions were carried out by white colonists led by Northern Territory Police constable William George Murray in response to the murder of a dingo hunter, resulting in the deaths of dozens to hundreds of people of the Warlpiri, Anmatyerre, and Kaytetye groups. This was one of many massacres of Aboriginal people in the region. For more information see: List of massacres of Indigenous Australians.

====Post-World War II====
During World War II, most of the Top End was placed under military government. This is the only time since Federation that part of an Australian state or territory has been under military control. After the war, control for the entire area was handed back to the Commonwealth. The Bombing of Darwin occurred on 19 February 1942. It was the largest single attack ever mounted by a foreign power on Australia. Evidence of Darwin&#x27;s World War II history is found at a variety of preserved sites in and around the city, including ammunition bunkers, airstrips, oil tunnels and museums. The port was damaged in the 1942 Japanese air raids. It was subsequently restored.

In the late 1960s improved roads in adjoining States linking with the territory, port delays and rapid economic development led to uncertainty in port and regional infrastructure development. As a result of the Commission of Enquiry established by the Administrator, port working arrangements were changed, berth investment deferred and a port masterplan prepared. Extension of rail transport was then not considered because of low freight volumes.

Indigenous Australians had struggled for rights to fair wages and land. An important event in this struggle was the strike and walk off by the Gurindji people at Wave Hill Cattle Station in 1966. The Northern Territory Council for Aboriginal Rights (NTCAR) supported the strikers and provided publicity. The Federal government of Gough Whitlam set up the Woodward Royal Commission in February 1973, to enquire into how land rights might be achieved in the Northern Territory. Justice Woodward&#x27;s first report in July 1973 recommended that a Central Land Council and a Northern Land Council be established to present to him the views of Aboriginal people. A Land Rights Bill was drafted, and the &quot;Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976&quot; was passed by the Fraser government on 16 December 1976 and began operation on 26 January 1977). The Northern Territory Council for Aboriginal Rights was disestablished in 1976.

In 1974, from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day, Darwin was devastated by tropical Cyclone Tracy. Cyclone Tracy killed 71 people, caused A$837 million in damage (approximately A$6.85 billion ) and destroyed more than 70 per cent of Darwin&#x27;s buildings, including 80 per cent of houses. Tracy left more than 41,000 out of the 47,000 inhabitants of the city homeless. The city was rebuilt with much-improved construction codes and is a modern, landscaped metropolis today.

In 1978 the Territory was granted Self Government with a Legislative Assembly headed by a Chief Minister. The Administrator of the Northern Territory is another important position in the government and they act as the King&#x27;s representative in the Territory and a part of their role is appointing the Chief Minister. The Territory also publishes official notices in its own &quot;Government Gazette&quot;.

In the 1980s, conservation-oriented areas in the Northern Territory such as Kakadu National Park and Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their mix of natural heritage and Aboriginal culture.

During 1995–96 the Northern Territory was briefly one of the few places in the world with legal voluntary euthanasia, until the Federal Parliament overturned the legislation. Before the over-riding legislation was enacted, four people used the law supported by Dr Philip Nitschke.

==Geography==

There are many very small settlements scattered across the Territory, but the larger population centres are located on the single paved road that links Darwin to southern Australia, the Stuart Highway, known to locals simply as &quot;the track&quot;.

The Territory is home to many spectacular natural rock formations, including Uluru / Ayers Rock and Kata Tjuta / The Olgas in the Central Australian region and Kakadu National Park in the north. Each of these sites are sacred to the local Aboriginal people and which have become major International tourist attractions and recognised UNESCO World Heritage sites.

The northern portion of the Territory is principally tropical savannas, composed of several distinct ecoregions – Arnhem Land tropical savanna, Carpentaria tropical savanna, Kimberley tropical savanna, Victoria Plains tropical savanna, and Mitchell Grass Downs. The southern portion of the Territory is covered in deserts and xeric shrublands, including the Great Sandy-Tanami desert, Simpson Desert, and Central Ranges xeric scrub.

There are also an extensive series of river systems in the Territory. These rivers include: the Alligator Rivers, Daly River, Finke River, McArthur River, Roper River, Todd River and Victoria River. The Hay River is a river south-west of Alice Springs, with the Marshall River, Arthur Creek, Camel Creek and Bore Creek flowing into it.

===Climate===

The Northern Territory has two distinctive climate zones.

The northern end, including Darwin, has a tropical climate with high humidity and two seasons, the wet (October to April) and dry season (May to September). During the dry season nearly every day is warm and sunny, and afternoon humidity averages around 30%. There is very little rainfall between May and September. In the coolest months of June and July, the daily minimum temperature may dip as low as , but very rarely lower, and frost has never been recorded.

The wet season is associated with tropical cyclones and monsoon rains. The majority of rainfall occurs between December and March (the southern hemisphere summer), when thunderstorms are common and afternoon relative humidity averages over 70% during the wettest months. On average more than of rain falls in the north. Rainfall is highest in north-west coastal areas, where rainfall averages from .

The central region is the desert centre of the country, which includes Alice Springs and Uluru (Ayers Rock), and is semi-arid with little rain usually falling during the hottest months from October to March. Seasons are more distinct in central Australia, with very hot summers and cool winters. Frost is recorded a few times a year. The region receives less than of rain per year.

The highest temperature recorded in the territory was at Finke on 1 and 2 January 1960. The lowest temperature was at Alice Springs on 17 July 1976.

==Governance==

===Parliament===

The Northern Territory Parliament is one of the three unicameral parliaments in the country. Based on the Westminster System, it consists of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly which was created in 1974, replacing the Northern Territory Legislative Council. It also produces the &quot;Northern Territory of Australia Government Gazette&quot;.

The Northern Territory Legislative Council was the partly elected governing body from 1947 until its replacement by the fully elected Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in 1974. The total enrolment for the 1947 election was 4,443. The Northern Territory was split into five electorates: Darwin, Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Batchelor, and Stuart.

While this assembly exercises powers similar to those of the parliaments of the states of Australia, it does so by legislated devolution of powers from the Commonwealth Government, rather than by any constitutional right. As such, the Commonwealth Government retains the right to legislate for the territory, including the power to override legislation passed by the Legislative Assembly. The Monarch is represented by the Administrator of the Northern Territory, who performs a role similar to that of a state governor.

Twenty-five members of the Legislative Assembly are elected to four-year terms from single-member electorates.

Numerous times since self government was granted there has been agitation for full statehood within the region. A referendum of voters in the Northern Territory was held on the issue in 1998, which resulted in a &#x27;no&#x27; vote. This was a shock to both the Northern Territory and Commonwealth governments, as opinion polls showed most Territorians supported statehood. But under the Australian Constitution, the federal government may set the terms of entry to full statehood. The Northern Territory was offered three senators, rather than the twelve guaranteed to original states (because of the difference in populations, equal numbers of Senate seats would mean a Territorian&#x27;s vote for a senator would have been worth more than 30 such votes in New South Wales or Victoria). Alongside what was cited as an arrogant approach adopted by then chief minister Shane Stone, it is believed that most Territorians, regardless of their general views on statehood, were reluctant to adopt the particular offer that was made.

===Chief minister and cabinet===
The chief minister is the head of government of a self-governing territory (the head of a state government is a &quot;premier&quot;). The chief minister is appointed by the administrator, who in normal circumstances appoints the leader of whichever party holds the majority of seats in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. The current chief minister is Lia Finocchiaro of the Country Liberal Party. The CLP defeated Territory Labor to win office on 24 August 2024.

===Administrator===
The Northern Territory became self-governing on 1 July 1978 under its own administrator appointed by the Governor-General of Australia. The federal government, not the NT government, advises the governor-general on the appointment of the administrator, but by convention consults first with the Territory government. The current administrator is Hugh Heggie who commenced his three-year term on 31 January 2023; he had previously served as the Northern Territory’s Chief Health Officer.

===Federal government===

The Northern Territory is represented in the federal parliament by two members in the House of Representatives and two members in the Senate. As of May 2022, resulting from the 2022 federal election, Marion Scrymgour from the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in Lingiari and Luke Gosling from the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in Solomon serve in the House of Representatives, and Malarndirri McCarthy from the ALP and Jacinta Nampijinpa Price from the Country Liberal Party serve in the Senate.

===Local government===
The Northern Territory is divided into seventeen local government areas: two cities, three municipalities, nine regions, and three shires. Shire, city and town councils are responsible for functions delegated by the Northern Territory parliament, such as road infrastructure and waste management. Council revenue comes mostly from property taxes and government grants.

===Aboriginal land councils===
Aboriginal land councils in the Northern Territory are groups of Aboriginal landowners, set up under the &quot;Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976&quot;.

=== Political parties ===
The two historically dominant political parties in the Northern Territory are the conservative Country Liberal Party which governed the Territory from 1974 to 2001, from 2012 to 2016 and Since 2024, and the social-democratic Australian Labor Party which governed the Territory from 2001 to 2012 and from 2016 to 2024. Minor parties that are also active in the NT include the Northern Territory Greens, the Shooters and Fishers Party and various others. It is common for independent politicians to win elections.

The CLP&#x27;s rule was once so tight, that a former minister once said the CLP had a &quot;&#x27;rightful inheritance of being the party that runs this place&#x27;&quot;.

The 2024 Northern Territory general election saw the NT Greens win a seat in the Legislative Assembly, with Kat McNamara defeating former Chief Minister Natasha Fyles in the seat of Nightcliff; this marked the first time the Greens entered the Legislative Assembly in the history of the Northern Territory. 

As fewer parties and candidates contest Northern Territory general elections than they do Australian federal elections in the Northern Territory, the CLP, Labor and independents usually have a higher vote share at territory elections than at federal elections in the Northern Territory due to the absence of right-wing minor parties such as Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation and the fact that the Greens do not run in every seat at territory elections.

==Demographics==


The population of the Northern Territory at the 2011 Australian census was 211,945, a 10 per cent increase from the 2006 census. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated a June 2015 resident population of 244,300, taking into account residents overseas or interstate. The territory&#x27;s population represents 1% of the total population of Australia.

The Northern Territory&#x27;s population is the youngest in Australia and has the largest proportion (23.2%) under 15 years of age and the smallest proportion (5.7%) aged 65 and over. The median age of residents of the Northern Territory is 31 years, six years younger than the national median age.

Indigenous Australians make up 30.3% of population and own some 49% of the land. The life expectancy of Aboriginal Australians is well below that of non-Indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory, a fact that is mirrored elsewhere in Australia. ABS statistics suggest that Indigenous Australians die about 11 years earlier than the average non-Indigenous Australian. There are Aboriginal communities in many parts of the territory, the largest ones being the Pitjantjatjara near Uluru / Ayers Rock, the Arrernte near Alice Springs, the Luritja between those two, the Warlpiri further north, and the Yolngu in eastern Arnhem Land.

In 2019, 147,255 people lived in Darwin, an overwhelming majority of the Territory&#x27;s population. Despite this, the Northern Territory is the least urbanised jurisdiction in the Commonwealth (followed by Tasmania).

=== Cities and towns ===



===Ancestry and immigration===
At the 2016 census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were: 
31.2% of the population was born overseas at the 2016 census. The five largest groups of overseas-born were from the Philippines (2.6%), England (2.4%), New Zealand (2%), India (1.6%) and Greece (0.6%).

25.5% of the population, or 58,248 people, identified as Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders) in 2016.

=== Languages ===
At the 2021 census, 57.3% of the population spoke only English at home. The other languages most commonly spoken at home were Kriol (2.2%), Djambarrpuyngu (1.7%), Greek (1.4%) and Nepali (1.3%).

There are more than 100 Aboriginal languages and dialects spoken in the Northern Territory, in addition to English which is most common in cities such as Darwin or Alice Springs. Major indigenous languages spoken in the Northern Territory include Murrinh-patha and Ngangikurrungurr in the northwest around Wadeye, Warlpiri and Warumungu in the centre around Tennant Creek, Arrernte around Alice Springs, Pintupi-Luritja to the south east, Pitjantjatjara in the south near Uluru / Ayers Rock, Yolngu Matha to the far north in Arnhem Land (where the dialect Djambarrpuyngu of Dhuwal is considered a lingua franca), and Burarra, Maung, Iwaidja and Kunwinjku in the centre north and on Croker Island and the Goulburn Islands. Tiwi is spoken on Melville Island and Bathurst Island. Literature in many of these languages is available in the Living Archive of Aboriginal Languages.

===Religion===
In the 2021 census, Christianity is the major Religious affiliation in Northern Territory followed by 40.5% of its population. In 1971, Christianity was followed by 70.2% of the population and it has been declining since, while percentage of people who identified as having no religious affiliation has increased from 17.9% in 1971 to 38.5% in 2021.

Hinduism is the territory&#x27;s largest non-Christian religion (2.7%), followed by Buddhism (2.1%) and Islam (1.4%).

==Education==
===Primary and secondary===
A Northern Territory school education consists of six years of primary schooling, including one transition year, three years of middle schooling, and three years of secondary schooling. In the beginning of 2007, the Northern Territory introduced Middle School for Years 7–9 and High School for Years 10–12. Northern Territory children generally begin school at age five. On completing secondary school, students earn the Northern Territory Certificate of Education and Training (NTCET). Students who successfully complete their secondary education also receive a tertiary entrance ranking, or ATAR score, to determine university admittance.

Northern Territory schools are either publicly or privately funded. Public schools, also known as state or government schools, are funded and run directly by the Department of Education. Private fee-paying schools include schools run by the Catholic Church and independent schools, some elite ones similar to English public schools. Some Northern Territory Independent schools are affiliated with Protestant, Lutheran, Anglican, Greek Orthodox or Seventh-day Adventist Churches, but include non-church schools and an Indigenous school.

As of 2009, the Northern Territory had 151 public schools, 15 Catholic schools and 21 independent schools. 39,492 students were enrolled in schools around the territory with 29,175 in public schools, and 9,882 in independent schools. The Northern Territory has about 4,000 full-time teachers.

===Tertiary===
The Northern Territory has one university which opened in 1989 under the name of the Northern Territory University. Now renamed as the Charles Darwin University, it had about 19,000 students enrolled: about 5,500 higher education students and about 13,500 students on vocational education and training (VET) courses. The first tertiary institution in the territory was the Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education which was established in the mid-1960s.

===Libraries and archives===
Library &amp; Archives NT is the Northern Territory&#x27;s public research library and archival organisation and it supports the development of library services across the Territory by supporting public libraries. Library &amp; Archives NT was formed in 2019 following the merge of the Northern Territory Archives Service and the Northern Territory Library.

The National Archives of Australia also have a repository in Darwin, this is collocated with the Library &amp; Archives NT repository at the Northern Territory Archives Centre.

==Economy==
===Mining===

The Northern Territory&#x27;s economy is largely driven by mining, which is concentrated on energy producing minerals, petroleum and energy and contributes around $2.5 billion to the gross state product and employs over 4,600 people. Mining accounts for 14.9% of the gross state product in 2014–15 compared to just 7% nationally.

In recent years, largely due to the effect of major infrastructure projects and mine expansions, construction has overtaken mining as the largest single industry in the territory. Construction, mining and manufacturing, and government and community services, combine to account for about half of the territory&#x27;s gross state product (GSP), compared to about a third of national gross domestic product (GDP).

The economy has grown considerably over the past decade, from a value of $15 billion in 2004–05 to over $22 billion in 2014–15. In 2012–13 the territory economy expanded by 5.6%, over twice the level of national growth, and in 2014–15 it grew by 10.5%, four times the national growth rate.

Between 2003 and 2006 the gross state product had risen from $8.67 billion to $11.476 billion, an increase of 32.4%. During the three years to 2006–2007 the Northern Territory gross state product grew by an average annual rate of 5.5%. Gross state product per capita in the Northern Territory ($72,496) is higher than any Australian state or territory and is also higher than the gross domestic product per capita for Australia ($54,606).

The Northern Territory&#x27;s exports were up 12.9% or $681 million in 2012–13. The largest contributor to the territory&#x27;s exports was: mineral fuels (largely LNG), crude materials (mainly mineral ores) and food and live animals (primarily live cattle). The main international markets for territory exports are Japan, China, Indonesia, the United States and Korea.

Imports to the Northern Territory totalled $2,887.8 million which consisted of mainly machinery and equipment manufacturing (58.4%) and petroleum, coal, chemical and associated product manufacturing (17.0%).

The principal mining operations are bauxite at Gove Peninsula where the production is estimated to increase 52.1% to $254 million in 2007–08, manganese at Groote Eylandt, production is estimated to increase 10.5% to $1.1 billion which will be helped by the newly developed mines include Bootu Creek and Frances Creek, gold which is estimated to increase 21.7 per cent to $672 million at the Union Reefs plant and uranium at Ranger Uranium Mine.

===Tourism===
Tourism is an important economic driver for the territory and a significant industry in regional areas. Iconic destinations such as Uluru / Ayers Rock and Kakadu make the Northern Territory a popular destination for domestic and international travellers. Diverse landscapes, waterfalls, wide open spaces, aboriginal culture and wild and untamed wildlife provides the opportunity for visitors to immerse themselves in the natural wonder that the Northern Territory offers. In 2015, the territory received a total of about 1.6 million domestic and international visitors contributing an estimated $2.0 billion to the local economy. Holiday visitors made up the majority of total visitation (about 792,000 visitors).

Tourism has strong links to other sectors in the economy including accommodation and food services, retail trade, recreation and culture, and transport.

Wide Open Space is an annual festival of music, arts and culture that takes place over three days at the Ross River Resort in the McDonnell Ranges, around east of Alice Springs. over three days in April/May.

===Other industries===
The Northern Territory announced that it will undertake a project which will benefit its marine industry, including the development of a new Marine Industry Park near Darwin.

==Transport==

The Northern Territory is the most sparsely populated state or territory in Australia.

The NT has a connected network of sealed roads, including two national highways, linking with adjoining states and connecting the major territory population centres, and other important centres such as Uluru (Ayers Rock), Kakadu and Litchfield National Parks. The Stuart Highway, once known as &quot;The Track&quot;, runs north to south, connecting Darwin and Alice Springs to Adelaide. Some of the sealed roads are single-lane bitumen. Many unsealed (dirt) roads connect the more remote settlements.

The fatigue resulting from long-distance driving and the hazards inherent in dirt roads, wildlife, water crossings and wild weather have led the Northern Territory Government to pursue road safety campaigns in English and several Aboriginal languages. Persuading people to drive at the right speed for the road conditions has been a key goal. , the Northern Territory&#x27;s road vehicle speed limit in built-up areas was 60 kilometres per hour unless the town had gazetted a lower default speed limit: many had chosen 50 km/h or lower. Outside most built-up areas the default speed limit was 110 km/h unless a speed limit sign stated otherwise. Reflecting the nature of the topography and very low population density, some sections of the Arnhem, Barkly, Stuart and Victoria highways had a maximum speed of 130 km/h.

In 2004, a standard gauge railway was opened between Alice Springs and Darwin, completing the Adelaide–Darwin rail corridor and bringing to fruition the dream of a transcontinental railway initiated in 1878 with the Central Australia Railway from the south and the North Australia Railway from the north – but with a gap of more than 800 km (500 mi) between Alice Springs and Birdum still to be bridged when the antique narrow-gauge railway was closed in 1976. The line carries fast freight trains and one passenger train: The Ghan experiential tourism train that runs between Darwin and Adelaide, stopping in the NT at Katherine, Tennant Creek, Alice Springs and Kulgera.

Darwin International Airport is the major domestic and international airport for the territory. Several smaller airports are also scattered throughout the territory and are served by smaller airlines, including Alice Springs Airport, Ayers Rock Airport, Katherine Airport and Tennant Creek Airport.

==Media==
===Print===
The Northern Territory has only one daily tabloid newspaper, News Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Northern Territory News,&quot; or &quot;NT News&quot;. &quot;The Sunday Territorian&quot; is the sister paper to the &quot;NT News&quot; and is the only dedicated Sunday tabloid newspaper in the Northern Territory.

The &quot;Centralian Advocate&quot; is circulated around the Alice Springs region twice a week. There are also five weekly community newspapers. The territory receives the national daily, &quot;The Australian&quot;, while &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age&quot; and the &quot;Guardian Weekly&quot; are also available in Darwin. Katherine&#x27;s paper is the &quot;Katherine Times&quot;.

There is an LGBT community publication, QNews Magazine, which is published in Darwin and Alice Springs.

===Television===
Metropolitan Darwin has had five broadcast television stations:
* ABC Northern Territory – (ABD)
* SBS Northern Territory – (SBS)
* Southern Cross Seven – (TND) – &quot;Seven Network Affiliate&quot;
* Nine Network Darwin – (NTD)
* Ten Darwin (or Darwin Digital Television) – (DTD) – &quot;Network Ten Affiliate&quot;

Darwin also has four open-narrowcast stations:
* First Nations TV

<text>Low-alcohol beer is beer with little or no alcohol by volume that aims to reproduce the taste of beer while eliminating or reducing the inebriating effect, carbohydrates, and calories of regular alcoholic brews. Low-alcohol beers can come in different beer styles such as lagers, stouts, and ales. Low-alcohol beer is also known as light beer, non-alcoholic beer, [[small beer]], small ale, or near-beer.

==History==
Low-alcohol brews such as small beer date back at least to medieval Europe, where they served as a less risky alternative to water (which often was polluted by faeces and parasites) and were less expensive than higher-quality, higher-alcohol brews like stouts, porters, and ales.

More recently, the temperance movements and the need to avoid alcohol while driving, operating machinery, taking certain medications, etc. led to the development of non-intoxicating beers.

In the United States, according to John Naleszkiewicz, non-alcoholic brews were promoted during Prohibition. In 1917, President Wilson proposed limiting the alcohol content of malt beverages to 2.75% to try to appease avid prohibitionists. In 1919, Congress approved the Volstead Act, which limited the alcohol content of all beverages to 0.5%. These very-low-alcohol beverages became known as &quot;tonics&quot;, and many breweries began brewing them in order to stay in business during Prohibition. Since removing the alcohol from the beer requires just one extra step, many breweries saw it as an easy change. In 1933, when Prohibition was repealed, breweries simply omitted this extra step.

By the 1980s and 90s, &quot;light&quot; beers became more popular. Declining consumption has also led to the introduction of mass-market non-alcoholic beverages, dubbed &quot;near beer&quot;. Low-alcohol and alcohol-free bars and pubs have also been established to cater for drinkers of non-alcoholic beverages.

In the UK, the introduction of a lower rate of beer duty for low-strength beer (of 2.8% ABV or less) in October 2011 spurred many small brewers to revive old styles of small beer and create higher-hopped craft beers at the lower alcohol level to be able to lower the cost of their beer to consumers.

At the start of the 21st century, alcohol-free beer has seen a rise in popularity in the Middle East (which now makes up a third of the market). One reason for this is that Islamic scholars issued &quot;fatawa&quot; which permitted the consumption of beer as long as large quantities could be consumed without getting drunk. By 2022, craft hop water has become a market unto itself in the United States, with one Southern California brewer regarding it as not being beer at all.

==Pros and cons==
Positive features of non-alcoholic brews include the ability to drive after consuming several drinks, the reduction in alcohol-related illness, and fewer severe hangover symptoms. Low-alcohol and alcohol-free beers are usually lower in calories than equivalent full-strength beers.

Some common complaints about non-alcoholic brews include a loss of flavor, addition of one step in the brewing process, sugary taste, and a shorter shelf life. There are also legal implications. Some state governments, e.g. Pennsylvania, prohibit the sale of non-alcoholic beers to persons under the age of 21. A study conducted by the department of psychology at Indiana University said, &quot;Because non-alcoholic beer provides sensory cues that simulate alcoholic beer, this beverage may be more effective than other placebos in contributing to a credible manipulation of expectancies to receive alcohol&quot;, making people feel &quot;drunk&quot; when physically they are not.

There is little to no research on consequences of drinking such products in pregnancy, but as they may contain trace amounts of alcohol, in rare cases even higher than 1% (despite labelling as 0%), one paper advises against drinking this type of non-alcoholic beverage during pregnancy.

==Categories==
In the United States, beverages containing less than 0.5% alcohol by volume (ABV) were legally called non-alcoholic, according to the now-defunct Volstead Act. Because of its very low alcohol content, non-alcoholic beer may be legally sold to people under age 21 in many American states.

In the United Kingdom, Government guidance recommends the following descriptions for &quot;alcohol substitute&quot; drinks including alcohol-free beer. The use of these descriptions is voluntary:

* No alcohol or alcohol-free: not more than 0.05% ABV
* Dealcoholized: over 0.05% but less than 0.5% ABV
* Low-alcohol: not more than 1.2% ABV

In some parts of the European Union, beer must contain no more than 0.5% ABV if it is labelled &quot;alcohol-free&quot;.

In Australia, the term &quot;light beer&quot; refers to any beer with less than 3.5% alcohol.

===Light beer===
Light beers are beers with reduced caloric content compared to regular beer, and typically also have a lower alcoholic content, depending on the brand and where they are sold. The spelling &quot;lite beer&quot; is also commonly used. Light beers are manufactured by reducing the carbohydrate content, and secondarily by reducing the alcohol content, since both carbohydrates and alcohol contribute to the caloric content of beer.

Light beers are marketed primarily to drinkers who wish to manage their calorie intake. However, these beers are sometimes criticized for being less flavorful than full-strength beers, being &quot;watered down&quot; (whether in perception or in fact), and thus advertising campaigns for light beers generally advertise their retention of flavor.

In Australia, regular beers have approximately 4%-5% ABV, while reduced-alcohol beers have 2.2%–3.2%.

In Canada, regular beers typically have 5% ABV, while a reduced-alcohol beer contains 2.6%–4.0% ABV and an &quot;extra-light&quot; beer contains less than 2.5%.

In the United States, most mass-market light beer brands, including Bud Light, Coors Light, and Miller Lite, have 4.2% ABV, less than ordinary beers from the same makers which are 5% ABV.

In Sweden, low alcohol beer is either 2.2%, 2.8% or 3.5%, and can be purchased in an ordinary supermarket whereas normal strength beers of above 3.5% must be purchased at &quot;Systembolaget&quot;. Beer containing 2.8-3.5% ABV (called Folköl or &quot;Peoples&#x27; Beer&quot;) may be legally sold in any convenience store to people over 18 years of age, whereas stronger beer may only be sold in state-run liquor stores to people older than 20. In addition, businesses selling food for on-premises consumption do not need an alcohol license to serve 3.5% beer. Virtually all major Swedish brewers, and several international ones, in addition to their full-strength beer, make 3.5% folköl versions as well. Beer below or equaling 2.25% ABV (&quot;lättöl&quot;) is not legally subject to age restrictions; however, some stores voluntarily opt out from selling it to minors anyway.

===Low-point beer===
Low-point beer, which is often known in the United States as &quot;three-two beer&quot; or &quot;3 point 2 brew&quot;, is beer that contains 3.2% alcohol by weight (equivalent to about 4% ABV).

The term &quot;low-point beer&quot; is unique to the United States, where some states limit the sale of beer, but beers of this type are also available in countries (such as Sweden and Finland) that tax or otherwise regulate beer according to its alcohol content.

In the United States, 3.2 beer was the highest alcohol content beer allowed to be produced legally for nine months in 1933. As part of his New Deal, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Cullen–Harrison Act that repealed the Volstead Act on 22 March 1933. In December 1933, the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed, eliminating a federal level prohibition on the production and sale of alcoholic beverages and returning to the states the power to regulate them within their borders.

After the repeal of Prohibition, a number of state laws prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors remained in effect. As these were repealed, they were first replaced by laws limiting the maximum alcohol content allowed for sale as 3.2 ABW. As of 2019, the state of Minnesota permits general establishments such as supermarket chains and convenience stores to sell only low-point beer; in the 2010s, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Utah revised state laws to end this practice. In the states that maintain such laws, all alcoholic beverages containing more than 3.2% alcohol by weight (ABW) must be sold from state-licensed liquor stores.

Missouri also has a legal classification for low-point beer, which it calls &quot;nonintoxicating beer&quot;. Unlike Minnesota and Utah, Missouri does not limit supermarket chains and convenience stores to selling only low-point beer. Instead, Missouri&#x27;s alcohol laws permit grocery stores, drug stores, gas stations, and even &quot;general merchandise stores&quot; (a term that Missouri law does not define) to sell any alcoholic beverage; consequently, 3.2% beer is rarely sold in Missouri.

===Near beer===

&quot;Near beer&quot; was a term for malt beverages containing little or no alcohol (less than 0.5% ABV), which were mass-marketed during Prohibition in the United States. Near beer could not legally be labeled as &quot;beer&quot; and was officially classified as a &quot;cereal beverage&quot;. 

The most popular &quot;near beer&quot; was Bevo, brewed by the Anheuser-Busch company. The Pabst company brewed &quot;Pablo&quot;, Miller brewed &quot;Vivo&quot;, and Schlitz brewed &quot;Famo&quot;. Many local and regional breweries stayed in business by marketing their own near-beers. By 1921, production of near beer had reached over 300 million US gallons (1 billion L) a year (36 L/s).

A popular illegal practice was to add alcohol to near beer. The resulting beverage was known as &quot;spiked beer&quot; or &quot;needle beer&quot;, so called because a needle was used to inject alcohol through the cork of the bottle or keg.

Food critic and writer Waverley Root described the common American near beer as &quot;such a wishy-washy, thin, ill-tasting, discouraging sort of slop that it might have been dreamed up by a Puritan Machiavelli with the intent of disgusting drinkers with genuine beer forever.&quot;

In the early 2010s, major breweries began experimenting with mass-market non-alcoholic beers to counter with declining alcohol consumption amid growing preference for craft beer, launching beverages like Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s Budweiser Prohibition Brew, launched in 2016.

A drink similar to &quot;near beer&quot;, &quot;bjórlíki&quot; was quite popular in Iceland before alcoholic beer was made legal in 1989. The Icelandic variant normally consisted of a shot of vodka added to a half-a-litre glass of light beer.

===Small beer===

Small beer (also, small ale) is a beer/ale that contains very little alcohol. Sometimes unfiltered and porridge-like, it was a favored drink in Medieval Europe and colonial North America as opposed to the often polluted water and the expensive beer used for festivities. Small beer was also produced in households for consumption by children and servants.

However, small beer/small ale can also refer to a beer made of the &quot;second runnings&quot; from a very strong beer (e.g., scotch ale) mash. These beers can be as strong as a mild ale, depending on the strength of the original mash. This was done as an economy measure in household brewing in England up to the 18th century and is still done by some homebrewers. One commercial brewery, San Francisco&#x27;s Anchor Brewing Company, also produces their &quot;Anchor Small Beer&quot; using the second runnings from their Old Foghorn Barleywine. The term is also used for commercially produced beers which are thought to taste too weak.

===Non-alcoholic beer===
As more people consume non-alcoholic beverages for health reasons, social reasons, or because they want to enjoy the taste of beer without the effects of alcohol, the global non-alcoholic beer market was expected to double by 2024 from the level in 2018.

====Arab world====
The Middle East accounts for almost a third of worldwide sales of nonalcoholic and alcohol-free beer.

====Malaysia====
The market for nonalcoholic beer in Malaysia has been slow in comparison to other Muslim-majority countries, and as of 2015, the Malaysian government has not approved any non-alcoholic beers as halal.

====Iran====

In 2008, the sale of non-alcoholic beers in Iran continued its high performance with double-digit growth rates in both value and volume and is expected to more than double its total volume sales between 2008 and 2013.

====India====
Non alcoholic beer sales in India are relatively low.

====United States====
The United States has seen a rise in non-alcoholic beer consumption over the last decade.

====Europe====
Spain is the main consumer and producer of low-alcohol beer in the European Union.

====United Kingdom====
As of March 2020, sales of alcohol-free beer were up by 30% since 2016, with younger generations shunning alcoholic beverages. Brewers have introduced low or no alcohol varieties of established brands to meet the increased demand for low-alcohol beers, and new low-alcohol brands such as Lucky Saint have seen success in the UK market.

==Legal drinking age in the US==
Beers that are labeled &quot;non-alcoholic&quot; still contain a very small amount of alcohol. Thus, some US states require the purchaser to be 21 years old, which is the legal drinking age in the United States. Exceptions include:

*In Texas, the law does not prohibit minors from consuming or buying non-alcoholic beer, but does specify that a beverage containing more than 0.5% ABV is an alcoholic beverage and thus will follow the same restrictions as regular beer.
*In Minnesota, non-alcoholic beer (less than 0.5% ABV) does not fit in the category that the state defines as an alcoholic beverage and can be purchased by those under the legal drinking age.
*In Wisconsin, the law does not regulate non-alcoholic beer (less than 0.5% ABV), which can be purchased without any age restriction.
*In New Jersey, the law governs only beverages of at least 0.5% ABV.
*In Illinois, beverages with under 0.5% ABV are not governed by the Illinois Liquor Control Act and can be purchased and consumed by minors.
*In the District of Columbia, the District&#x27;s alcohol laws apply to all beverages and food products that have 0.5% ABV or higher, and prohibit their purchase by anyone under 21. The laws do not reference products labeled as &quot;non-alcoholic beverage.&quot;
*In Alaska, &quot;...non-alcoholic beer and wine (containing less than 0.5% alcohol by volume) are not considered alcoholic beverages.
*In Hawaii, Hawaii State Liquor Law §281-1 defines liquor as &quot;...containing one-half of one per cent or more of alcohol by volume...,&quot; and a minor as &quot;any person below the age of twenty-one years.&quot;

==Production process==
According to the Birmingham Beverage Company, the brewing process of traditional brews consists of eight basic steps, nine for brewing non-alcoholic brews.

#Malting – Barley is prepared by soaking it in water and allowing the grain to germinate or &quot;sprout&quot;. This allows the tough starch molecules to be softened and begin converting to sugars. Next, the sprouts are dried in a kiln; the temperature at which the sprouts are dried will affect the flavor of the finished brew.
#Milling – Next the malted grain is ground to a cornmeal-like consistency, which allows the sugars and remaining starches to be more easily released when mixed with water.
#Mashing – The finely-ground malted grain is mixed with water and pulverized. By pulverizing the slurry, most of the remaining starches are converted to sugars due to enzymes present in the malt, and the sugars then dissolve into the water. The mix is gradually heated to in a mash tun. The slurry is then filtered to remove the majority of particulates. This filtered sugary liquid is called &quot;wort&quot;.
#Brewing – The wort is brought to a boil for roughly one to two hours. During this time, other grains that contribute flavor, color, and aroma to the brew are added. Boiling allows several chemical reactions to occur and reduces the water content in the wort, condensing it.
#Cooling – The wort is filtered to remove the majority of the grains and hops and then immediately cooled to allow the yeast to survive and grow in the next step.
#Fermenting – The cooled wort is saturated with air, and yeast is added in the fermentation tank. Different strains of yeast create different styles of beer. This step takes around ten days.
#Maturation – The freshly fermented uncarbonated beer is placed into a conditioning tank and, in a similar process to wine making, is allowed to age. If this step is rushed the beer will have an off flavor (acetaldehyde) that beer experts sometimes refer to as &quot;green beer&quot; because of its resemblance to green apples. During this process of aging, the majority of the residual particulates will settle to the bottom of the tank.
# Alcohol removal – Typical low- and non-alcohol beers go through an alcohol-reducing step right before finishing.
#Finishing – The beer is filtered one last time; it is then carbonated and moved into a storage tank for either bottling or kegging.

Typical low- and non-alcohol beer starts out as regular alcoholic beer, which is then processed to remove the alcohol.
* The simplest (and cheapest) method is to merely add water to it until the desired alcohol level is reached.
* Older processes heat the beer to evaporate most of the alcohol. Since alcohol is more volatile than water, as the beer is heated alcohol boils off first. The alcohol is allowed to escape and the remaining liquid becomes the product, in what is essentially the opposite of the process used to make distilled beverages.
** Most modern breweries utilize vacuum evaporation to reduce the boiling temperature which better maintains flavor: the beer is placed under a light vacuum to facilitate the alcohol molecules going into the gaseous phase. If a sufficient vacuum is applied, it is not necessary to &quot;cook&quot; the beer at a temperature that destroys the flavor. Some heat must nevertheless be supplied to counter the heat lost to enthalpy of vaporization.
* A modern alternative process uses reverse osmosis to avoid heating the product at all. Under pressure, the beer is passed through a polymeric filter with pores small enough that only alcohol and water (and a few volatile acids) can pass through. A syrupy mixture of complex carbohydrates and most of the flavor compounds are retained by the filter. Alcohol is then distilled out of the filtered alcohol-water mix using conventional distillation methods. The water and remaining acids are added back into the syrup left behind on the filter, followed by the normal finishing process of carbonation and bottling.
* Another modern process is &quot;dual-stage vacuum filtration&quot;. Flavor and aroma is captured first in a low vacuum stage, then the beverage is placed into an even lower vacuum until water and ethanol separate. The flavor, aroma and remaining beverage are then recombined to create a non-alcoholic stream of the input beverage (beer, wine, or cider), preserving the flavor, aroma, and color; the ethanol can be used to make a mostly flavorless hard seltzer base. In the United States, the technology is classified as a &quot;filter&quot; by the TTB, and therefore requires no additional permits or licensing.

A different approach to making 0.5% non-alcoholic beer is to reduce the formation of alcohol in the first place, so that craft brewers do not need to pay the expense of having to dealcoholize a beer. Methods include using special low-sugar grains, yeast which converts less sugar to alcohol, or removing sugar from the wort before fermentation. These can be combined with limited fermentation, in which the fermentation process is stopped early.

==Identity==
In an attempt to create a readily recognizable identity for low-alcohol beer, some brands were incorporating the colour blue into the packaging design as of 2018, including Becks Blue, Heineken 0.0%, Ožujsko Cool and Erdinger Alkoholfrei.

<text>Norman Robert Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank (born 1 June 1935) is an English architect and designer. Closely associated with the development of high-tech architecture, Foster is recognised as a key figure in British modernist architecture. His architectural practice Foster + Partners, first founded in 1967 as Foster Associates, is the largest in the United Kingdom, and maintains offices internationally. He is the president of the Norman Foster Foundation, created to &#x27;promote interdisciplinary thinking and research to help new generations of architects, designers and urbanists to anticipate the future&#x27;. The foundation, which opened in June 2017, is based in Madrid and operates globally. Foster was awarded the Pritzker Prize in 1999.

==Early life and education==
Norman Robert Foster was born in 1935 in Reddish, north of Stockport, then a part of Lancashire. He was the only child of Robert and Lilian Foster (née Smith). The family moved to Levenshulme, near Manchester, where they lived in poverty. His father was a machine painter at the Metropolitan-Vickers works in Trafford Park, which influenced Norman to take up engineering, design, and, ultimately, architecture. His mother worked in a local bakery. Foster&#x27;s parents were diligent and hard workers who often had neighbours and family members look after her son, which Foster later believed restricted his relationship with his mother and father.

Foster attended Burnage Grammar School for Boys in Burnage, where he was bullied by fellow pupils and took up reading. He considered himself quiet and awkward in his early years. At 16, he left school and passed an entrance exam for a trainee scheme set up by Manchester Town Hall, which led to his first job, an office junior and clerk in the treasurer&#x27;s department. In 1953, Foster completed his national service in the Royal Air Force, choosing the air force because aircraft had been a longtime hobby. Upon returning to Manchester, Foster went against his parents&#x27; wishes and sought employment elsewhere. He had seven O-levels by this time, and applied to work at a duplicating machine company, telling the interviewer he had applied for the prospect of a company car and a £1,000 salary. Instead, he became an assistant to a contract manager at a local architects, John E. Beardshaw and Partners. The staff advised him that if he wished to become an architect, he should prepare a portfolio of drawings using the perspective and shop drawings from Beardshaw&#x27;s practice as an example. Beardshaw was so impressed with Foster&#x27;s drawings that he promoted him to the drawing department.

In 1956 Foster began study at the School of Architecture and City Planning, part of the University of Manchester. He was ineligible for a maintenance grant, so he took part-time jobs to fund his studies, including an ice-cream salesman, bouncer, and night shifts at a bakery making crumpets. During this time, he also studied at the local library in Levenshulme. His talent and hard work was recognised in 1959 when he won £105 and a RIBA silver medal for what he described as &quot;a measured drawing of a windmill&quot;. The windmill he drew was Bourn Windmill, Cambridgeshire. After graduating in 1961, Foster won the Henry Fellowship to the Yale School of Architecture in New Haven, Connecticut, where he met future business partner Richard Rogers and earned his master&#x27;s degree. At the suggestion of Yale art historian Vincent Scully, the pair travelled across America for a year to study architecture.

==Career==
===1960s–1980s===

In 1963 Foster returned to the UK and established his own architectural firm Team 4, with Rogers, Su Brumwell, and the sisters Georgie and Wendy Cheesman. Among their first projects was the Cockpit, a minimalist glass bubble installed in Cornwall, the features of which became a recurring theme in Foster&#x27;s future projects. After the four separated in 1967, Foster and Wendy founded a new practice, Foster Associates. From 1968 to 1983, Foster collaborated with American architect Richard Buckminster Fuller on several projects that became catalysts in the development of an environmentally sensitive approach to design, such as the Samuel Beckett Theatre at St Peter&#x27;s College, Oxford.

Foster Associates concentrated on industrial buildings until 1969, when the practice worked on the administrative and leisure centre for Fred. Olsen Lines based in the London Docklands, which integrated workers and managers within the same office space. This was followed, in 1970, by the world&#x27;s first inflatable office building for Computer Technology Limited near Hemel Hempstead, which housed 70 employees for a year. The practice&#x27;s breakthrough project in England followed in 1974 with the completion of the Willis Faber &amp; Dumas headquarters in Ipswich, commissioned in 1970 and completed in 1975. The client, a family-run insurance company, wanted to restore a sense of community to the workplace. In response, Foster designed a space with modular, open plan office floors, long before open-plan became the norm, and placed a roof garden, 25-metre swimming pool, and gymnasium in the building to enhance the quality of life for the company&#x27;s 1,200 employees. The building has a full-height glass façade moulded to the medieval street plan and contributes drama, subtly shifting from opaque, reflective black to a glowing back-lit transparency as the sun sets. The design was inspired by the Daily Express Building in Manchester that Foster had admired as a youngster. The building is now Grade I listed. The Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, an art gallery and museum on the campus of the University of East Anglia, Norwich, was one of the first major public buildings to be designed by Foster, completed in 1978, and became grade II* listed in December 2012.

In 1981, Foster received a commission for the construction of a new terminal building at London&#x27;s Stansted Airport. Executed by Foster + Partners, the building, recognised as a landmark work of high-tech architecture, was opened to the public in 1991, and was awarded the 1990 European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture / Mies van der Rohe Award. As part of the project&#x27;s development, in 1988 Foster and British artist Brian Clarke made several proposals for an integral stained glass artwork for the terminal building; the principal proposal would have seen the walls of the terminal&#x27;s east and west elevations clad in two sequences of traditionally mouth-blown, leaded glass. For complex technical and security reasons, the original scheme, which Clarke considered to be his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, couldn&#x27;t be executed. Though unrealised, the collaboration is historically significant for its scale, its introduction of colour and materials broadly viewed as antithetical to high-tech architecture into a key work of that movement, and for having been the first time in the history of stained glass that computer-assisted design had been utilised in the creative process.

Foster gained a reputation for designing office buildings. In the 1980s he designed the HSBC Main Building in Hong Kong for the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (a founding member of the future HSBC Holdings plc), at the time the most expensive building ever constructed. The building is marked by its high level of light transparency, as all 3500 workers have a view to Victoria Peak or Victoria Harbour. Foster said that if the firm had not won the contract it would probably have been bankrupted.

===1990s–present===


Foster was assigned the brief for a development on the site of the Baltic Exchange, which had been damaged beyond repair by an IRA bomb, in the 1990s. Foster + Partners submitted a plan for a skyscraper, the London Millennium Tower, but its height was seen as excessive for London&#x27;s skyline. The proposal was scrapped and instead Foster proposed 30 St Mary Axe, popularly referred to as &quot;the gherkin&quot;, after its shape. Foster worked with engineers to integrate complex computer systems with the most basic physical laws, such as convection. In 1999, the company was renamed Foster + Partners.

By then, Foster&#x27;s style had evolved from its earlier sophisticated, machine-influenced high-tech vision into a more sharp-edged modernity. In 2004, Foster designed the tallest bridge in the world, the Millau Viaduct in Southern France, with the Millau Mayor Jacques Godfrain stating; &quot;The architect, Norman Foster, gave us a model of art.&quot;

Foster worked with Steve Jobs from about 2009 until Jobs&#x27; death to design the Apple offices, Apple Campus 2 (now called Apple Park), in Cupertino, California, US. Apple&#x27;s board and staff continued to work with Foster as the design was completed and the construction in progress. The circular building was opened to employees in April 2017, six years after Jobs died in 2011.

In January 2007, the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; reported that Foster had called in Catalyst, a corporate finance house, to find buyers for Foster + Partners. Foster does not intend to retire, but rather to sell his 80–90% holding in the company valued at £300 million to £500 million. In 2007, he worked with Philippe Starck and Sir Richard Branson of the Virgin Group for the Virgin Galactic plans.

Foster currently sits on the board of trustees at architectural charity Article 25 who design, construct and manage innovative, safe, sustainable buildings in some of the most inhospitable and unstable regions of the world. He has also been on the Board of Trustees of The Architecture Foundation. Foster believes that attracting young talent is essential, and is proud that the average age of people working for Foster and Partners is 32, just like it was in 1967.

In May 2022, it was announced that Foster would help plan reconstruction in Ukraine after the end of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

By 2024, Foster + Partners earned more than half a billion dollars in fees. 40% of Foster + Partner&#x27;s fees were paid by clients in the Middle East.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Foster has been married three times. His first wife, Wendy Cheesman, one of the four founders of Team 4, died from cancer in 1989. From 1991 to 1995, Foster was married to Begum Sabiha Rumani Malik. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1996, Foster married Spanish psychologist and art curator Elena Ochoa. He has five children; two of the four sons he had with Cheesman are adopted.

===Health===
In the 2000s, Foster was diagnosed with bowel cancer and was told he had weeks to live. He received chemotherapy treatment and made a full recovery. He also suffered a heart attack.

==Honours==
Foster was made a Knight Bachelor in the 1990 Birthday Honours, and thereby granted the title &quot;Sir&quot;. He was appointed to the Order of Merit (OM) in 1997. In the 1999 Birthday Honours, Foster&#x27;s elevation to the peerage was announced and he became Baron Foster of Thames Bank, of Reddish in the County of Greater Manchester in July.

Foster was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy (ARA) on 19 May 1983, and a Royal Academician (RA) on 26 June 1991. In 1995, he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (HonFREng). On 24 April 2017, he was given the Freedom of the City of London. The Bloomberg London building received a Stirling Prize in October 2018.

In 1986 he received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Bath.

==Recognition==
Foster received The Lynn S. Beedle Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat in 2007 to honour his contributions to the advancement of tall buildings.

He was awarded the Aga Khan Award for Architecture, for the University of Technology Petronas in Malaysia, and in 2008 he was granted an honorary degree from the Dundee School of Architecture at the University of Dundee. In 2009, he received the Prince of Asturias Award in the category &#x27;Arts&#x27;. In 2017, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Lord Jacob Rothschild during the International Achievement Summit in London. In 2012, Foster was among the British cultural figures selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires.

<doc id="21642" wikidata="Q92604" url="?curid=21642" title="Niklaus Wirth">
<text>Niklaus Emil Wirth (IPA: ) (15 February 1934 – 1 January 2024) was a Swiss computer scientist. He designed several programming languages, including Pascal, and pioneered several classic topics in software engineering. In 1984, he won the Turing Award, generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science, &quot;for developing a sequence of innovative computer languages&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Niklaus Emil Wirth was born in Winterthur, Switzerland, on 15 February 1934. He was the son of Hedwig (née Keller) and Walter Wirth, a high school teacher. Wirth studied electronic engineering at the Federal Institute of Technology, Zürich (ETH Zürich) from 1954 to 1958, graduating with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree. In 1960, he earned a Master of Science (M.Sc.) from Université Laval in Quebec. Then in 1963, he was awarded a PhD in electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) from the University of California, Berkeley, supervised by computer design pioneer Harry Huskey.

==Career==
From 1963 to 1967, Wirth served as assistant professor of computer science at Stanford University and again at the University of Zürich. In 1968, he became a professor of informatics at ETH Zürich, taking two one-year sabbaticals at Xerox PARC in California (1976–1977 and 1984–1985). He retired in 1999.

Although Wirth was involved with developing international standards in programming and informatics, as a member of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi, which specified, maintains, and supports the programming languages ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68, he got frustrated by the discussions in the standards groups and published his languages later on as personal work, mainly Pascal, Modula-2 and Oberon.

In 2004, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum &quot;for seminal work in programming languages and algorithms, including Euler, Algol-W, Pascal, Modula, and Oberon.&quot;

==Programming languages==
Wirth was the chief designer of the programming languages Euler (1965), PL360 (1966), ALGOL W (1966), Pascal (1970), Modula (1975), Modula-2 (1978), Oberon (1987), Oberon-2 (1991), and Oberon-07 (2007). He was also a major part of the design and implementation team for the operating systems Medos-2 (1983, for the Lilith workstation), and Oberon (1987, for the Ceres workstation), and for the Lola (1995) digital hardware design and simulation system.

In 1984, Wirth received the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Turing Award for the development of these languages. In 1994, he was inducted as a Fellow of the ACM.

In 1999, he received the ACM SIGSOFT Outstanding Research Award

==Wirth&#x27;s law==
In 1995, he popularized the adage now named Wirth&#x27;s law. In his 1995 paper &quot;A Plea for Lean Software&quot; he attributed the following to Martin Reiser phrasing it as, &quot;Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware becomes faster.&quot;

==Publications==
The April 1971 Communications of the ACM article &quot;Program Development by Stepwise Refinement&quot;, concerning the teaching of programming, is considered to be a classic text in software engineering. The paper is considered to be the earliest work to formally outline the top-down method for designing programs. The article was discussed by Fred Brooks in his influential book &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot; and was described as &quot;seminal&quot; in the ACM&#x27;s brief biography of Wirth published in connection to his Turing Award.

The 1973 textbook, &quot;Systematic Programming: An Introduction&quot;, was described as a quality source for mathematicians desiring to understand the nature of programming in a 1974 review. The cover flap, of the 1973 edition, stated the book &quot;... is tailored to the needs of people who view a course on systematic construction of algorithms as part of their basic mathematical training, rather than to the immediate needs of those who wish to be able to occasionally encode a problem and hand it over to their computer for instant solution.&quot; Described in the review as a challenging text to work through, it was nevertheless recommended as useful reading for those interested in numerical mathematics.

In 1974, &quot;The Pascal User Manual and Report&quot;, jointly written with Kathleen Jensen, served as the basis of many language implementation efforts in the 1970s (BSD Pascal), and 1980s in the United States and across Europe.

In 1975, he wrote the book &quot;Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs&quot;, which gained wide recognition. Major revisions of this book with the new title &quot;Algorithms &amp; Data Structures&quot; were published in 1986 and 2004. The examples in the first edition were written in Pascal. These were replaced in the later editions with examples written in Modula-2 and Oberon, respectively.

In 1992, Wirth and Jürg Gutknecht published the full documentation of the Oberon operating system. A second book, with Martin Reiser, was intended as a programming guide.

==Death==
Wirth died in Zürich on New Year&#x27;s Day 2024, at age 89.

<doc id="21646" wikidata="Q1571762" url="?curid=21646" title="National Cartoonists Society">
<text>The National Cartoonists Society (NCS) is an organization of professional cartoonists in the United States. It presents the National Cartoonists Society Awards. The Society was born in 1946 when groups of cartoonists got together to entertain the troops. They enjoyed each other&#x27;s company and decided to meet on a regular basis.

NCS members work in many branches of the profession, including advertising, animation, newspaper comic strips and syndicated single-panel cartoons, comic books, editorial cartoons, gag cartoons, graphic novels, greeting cards, magazine and book illustration. Only recently has the National Cartoonists Society embraced web comics. Membership is limited to established professional cartoonists, with a few exceptions of outstanding persons in affiliated fields. The NCS is not a guild or labor union.

The organization&#x27;s stated primary purposes are &quot;to advance the ideals and standards of professional cartooning in its many forms&quot;, &quot;to promote and foster a social, cultural and intellectual interchange among professional cartoonists of all types&quot; and &quot;to stimulate and encourage interest in and acceptance of the art of cartooning by aspiring cartoonists, students and the general public.&quot;

==History==
The National Cartoonists Society had its origins during World War II when cartoonists Gus Edson, Otto Soglow, Clarence D. Russell, Bob Dunn and others did chalk talks at hospitals for the USO in 1943. Edson recalled, &quot;We played two spots. Fort Hamilton and Governor&#x27;s Island. And then we quit the USO.&quot; They were lured away by choreographer and former Rockette Toni Mendez. When she learned of these chalk talks, she recruited the cartoonists to do shows for the Hospital Committee of the American Theatre Wing. Beginning with a performance emceed by humor columnist Bugs Baer at Halloran Hospital on Staten Island, these shows were produced and directed by Mendez. The group expanded to junkets on military transport planes, flying to military bases along the southeastern seaboard. On one of those flights, Russell proposed a club to Rube Goldberg and others so the group could still get together after WWII ended. Mendez recalled:

The Society was organized on a Friday evening, March 1, 1946, when 26 cartoonists gathered at 7pm in the Barberry Room on East 52nd Street in Manhattan. After drinks and dinner, they voted to determine officers and a name for their new organization. It was initially known as The Cartoonists Society. Goldberg was elected president with Russell Patterson as vice president, C. D. Russell as secretary and Milton Caniff, treasurer. Soglow was later added as second vice president (&quot;to follow the first vice president around&quot;). Mendez functioned as the Society&#x27;s trouble-shooter and later became an agent representing more than 50 cartoonists.

The 26 founding members came from the group of 32 members who had paid dues by March 13, including strip cartoonists Wally Bishop (&quot;Muggs and Skeeter&quot;), Martin Branner (&quot;Winnie Winkle&quot;), Ernie Bushmiller (&quot;Nancy&quot;), Milton Caniff, Gus Edson (&quot;The Gumps&quot;), Ham Fisher (&quot;Joe Palooka&quot;), Harry Haenigsen (&quot;Penny&quot;), Fred Harman (&quot;Red Ryder&quot;), Bill Holman (&quot;Smokey Stover&quot;), Jay Irving (&quot;Willie Doodle&quot;), Stan MacGovern (&quot;Silly Milly&quot;), Al Posen (&quot;Sweeney and Son&quot;), Clarence Russell (&quot;Pete the Tramp&quot;), Otto Soglow (&quot;The Little King&quot;), Jack Sparling (&quot;Claire Voyant&quot;), Raeburn Van Buren (&quot;Abbie an&#x27; Slats&quot;), Dow Walling (&quot;Skeets&quot;) and Frank Willard (&quot;Moon Mullins&quot;).

Also among the early 32 members were syndicated panel cartoonists Dave Breger (&quot;Mister Breger&quot;), George Clark (&quot;The Neighbors&quot;), Bob Dunn (&quot;Just the Type&quot;) and Jimmy Hatlo (&quot;They&#x27;ll Do It Every Time&quot;); freelance magazine cartoonists Abner Dean and Mischa Richter, editorial cartoonists Rube Goldberg (&quot;New York Sun&quot;), Burris Jenkins (&quot;New York Journal American&quot;), C. D. Batchelor (&quot;Daily News&quot;) and Richard Q. Yardley (&quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;); sports cartoonist Lou Hanlon; illustrator Russell Patterson and comic book artists Joe Shuster and Joe Musial.

More members joined by mid-May 1946, including Harold Gray (&quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;) and the Society&#x27;s first animator, Paul Terry, followed in the summer by letterer Frank Engli, Bela Zaboly (&quot;Popeye&quot;), Al Capp (&quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;) and (&quot;Bruce Gentry&quot;). By March 1947, the NCS had 112 members, including Bud Fisher (&quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot;), Don Flowers (&quot;Glamor Girls&quot;), Bob Kane (&quot;Batman&quot;), Fred Lasswell (&quot;Barney Google and Snuffy Smith&quot;), George Lichty (&quot;Grin and Bear It&quot;), Zack Mosley (&quot;The Adventures of Smilin&#x27; Jack&quot;), Alex Raymond (&quot;Rip Kirby&quot;), Cliff Sterrett (&quot;Polly and Her Pals&quot;) and Chic Young (&quot;Blondie&quot;), plus editorial cartoonists Reg Manning and Fred O. Seibel and sports cartoonist Willard Mullin.

Marge Devine Duffy, a secretary in King Features public relations department, had been helping Russell handle correspondence to the NCS, and in 1948, she was installed as the official NCS secretary and later given the title Scribe of the Society. Her name was on all the Society&#x27;s publications, and her address was the permanent mailing address of the NCS for more than 30 years. As the organizing secretary, she handled agendas, organization and publicity. &quot;She practically ran the damn thing,&quot; Caniff recalled. &quot;A real autocrat, and everyone was delighted to have her be an autocrat because that&#x27;s what we needed.&quot;

In the fall of 1949, the NCS cooperated with the Treasury Department to sell savings bonds, embarking in a nationwide tour to 17 major cities with teams of 10 or 12 cartoonists and a traveling display, &quot;20,000 Years of Comics&quot;, a 95-foot pictorial history of the comic strip.

Despite the contributions of Duffy and Mendez, there were no female members, as stipulated in the NCS&#x27; constitution which specified that &quot;any cartoonist (male) who signs his name to his published work&quot; could apply for membership. In 1949, Hilda Terry wrote a letter challenging that rule, and after more than six months of debates and votes, three women were finally admitted for membership in 1950—Terry, Edwina Dumm and gag cartoonist Barbara Shermund.

On November 6, 1951, 49 members of the NCS arrived at Washington&#x27;s Carlton Hotel for breakfast with Harry S. Truman. Gathered in Washington to help the Treasury Department sell Defense Stamps, the group presented Truman with a bound volume of their comic strip characters, some interacting with caricatures of Truman.

==USO Tour and charitable causes==
When Al Posen originated the idea of National Cartoonists Society tours to entertain American servicemen, he became the NCS Director of Overseas Shows. On October 4, 1952, nine cartoonists left on a USO-Camp Shows tour of U.S. Armed Forces installations in Europe, traveling via a Military Air Transport Service plane from Westover Air Force Base in Massachusetts and landing at Rhein-Main Air Base in Germany. On the tour, the cartoonists engaged models in each country to join in their &quot;Laff Time&quot; show of audience participation stunts and gags. The cartoonists were Posen, Charles Biro, Bob Dunn, Gus Edson, Bill Holman, Bob Montana, Russell Patterson, Clarence Russell and Dick Wingert (&quot;Hubert&quot;). The comic strip &quot;Dondi&quot; came about because of a friendship that developed between Edson and Irwin Hasen during a USO trip to Korea.

Hy Eisman described the atmosphere at the NCS when he joined in 1955:


During the 1960s, cartoonists of military comic strips went to the White House and met with Lyndon B. Johnson in the Oval Office. The group included Caniff, Bill Mauldin and Mort Walker.

In 1977–78, the National Cartoonists Society released &quot;The National Cartoonists Society Portfolio of Fine Comic Art&quot;, published by Collector&#x27;s Press. The portfolio featured a total of 34 art prints. Each 12&quot; x 16&quot; print was printed on archival fine art paper.

In 2011, to memorialize and commemorate the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, many NCS cartoonists auctioned off art that gave commentary to the tragedy and raised money for families victimized by the event in a reflective homage called, Cartoonists Remember. These cartoon tributes raised over $50,000 to benefit the 9/11 families. The art was featured and displayed in both nationally syndicated newspapers and museums across America, including the Newseum in Washington, DC, the Cartoon Art Museum in San Francisco and the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art in New York City.

In 2005, the Society formed a Foundation to continue the charitable works of its fund for indigent cartoonists, the Milt Gross Fund.

The Society&#x27;s offices are in Winter Park, Florida. In addition, the NCS has chartered 16 regional chapters throughout the United States and one in Canada. Chapter Chairpersons sit on the NCS Regional Council and are represented by a National Representative, who is a voting member of the Board of Directors. As NCS president for two consecutive terms, Jeff Keane, cartoonist for the &quot;Family Circus&quot; and son of comic creator, Bil Keane, returned to the charter and spirit of the NCS by extending the society&#x27;s outreach to the military by visiting and cartooning for vets who served in the Iraq War and Afghanistan War, during the years 2007–2011.

In 2008, NCS joined over 60 other art licensing businesses (including the Artists Rights Society, Association of American Editorial Cartoonists, Society of Children&#x27;s Book Writers and Illustrators, the Stock Artists Alliance, Illustrator&#x27;s Partnership of America and the Advertising Photographers of America) in opposing both The Orphan Works Act of 2008 and the Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act of 2008. Known collectively as &quot;Artists United Against the U.S. Orphan Works Acts&quot;, the diverse organizations joined forces to oppose the bills, which the groups believe &quot;permits, and even encourages, wide-scale infringements while depriving creators of protections currently available under the Copyright Act.&quot;

==Billy DeBeck Memorial Award==
The earliest NCS award was the Billy DeBeck Memorial Award, also known as &quot;the Barney&quot; from the character in Billy DeBeck&#x27;s popular comic strip &quot;Barney Google and Snuffy Smith&quot;. After DeBeck died on Veteran&#x27;s Day, 1942, Mary DeBeck remarried (as Mary Bergman) and created the DeBeck Award in 1946. She also made the annual presentation of engraved silver cigarette cases (with DeBeck&#x27;s characters etched on the cover) to the eight winners spanning the years 1946 to 1953.

Mary Bergman died February 14, 1953, aboard a National Airlines DC-6 which went down in the Gulf of Mexico during a thunderstorm on a flight from Tampa to New Orleans. In 1954, following her death, the DeBeck Award was renamed the Reuben Award, also known &quot;the Reuben&quot;. When the award name was changed in 1954, all of the prior eight winners were given Reuben statuettes designed by and named after the NCS&#x27; first president, Rube Goldberg. The Reuben Award was executed in bronze by sculptor and editorial cartoonist Bill Crawford.

== Reuben Award ==
The National Cartoonists Society Reuben Award
started in 1954, as the Billy DeBeck Memorial Award (the &quot;Barney&quot;), now named after Rube Goldberg.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalcartoonists/awards&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Award weekend is an annual gala event which takes place at a site selected by the President. During the formal, black-tie banquet evening, the Reuben Award (determined by secret ballot) is presented to the Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year. Cartoonists in various professional divisions are also honored with special plaques for excellence. These awards are voted by a combination of the general membership (by secret ballot) and specially-formed juries overseen by various NCS Regional Chapters. A cartoonist does not need to be a member of the NCS to receive one of the Society&#x27;s awards.

Prior to 1983, the Reuben Awards Dinner was held in New York City, usually at the Plaza Hotel. Since then, the event has expanded into a full weekend and is held in a different city each year. Recent Reuben locations have included New York City; Boca Raton; San Francisco; Cancún; Kansas City, Missouri; Las Vegas; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 2013.

Each year, during the NCS Annual Reuben Awards Weekend, the Society honors the year&#x27;s outstanding achievements in all walks of the profession. Excellence in the fields of newspaper strips, newspaper panels, TV animation, feature animation, newspaper illustration, gag cartoons, book illustration, greeting cards, comic books, magazine feature/magazine illustration and editorial cartoons, is honored in the NCS Division Awards, which are chosen by specially-convened juries at the chapter level. An Online Comic Strip Award was added in 2011.

The recipient of the profession&#x27;s highest honor, the Reuben Award for Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year, is chosen by a secret ballot of the members. As part of the presentations and general frivolity, the NCS has produced videos to initiate the festivities, some of which have been parodies of iconic entertainment.

<text>Nebraska ( ) is a landlocked state in the Midwestern region of the United States. It borders South Dakota to the north; Iowa to the east and Missouri to the southeast, both across the Missouri River; Kansas to the south; Colorado to the southwest; and Wyoming to the west. Nebraska is the 16th-largest state by land area, with just over . With a population of over 2 million as of 2024, it is the 38th-most populous state and the eighth-least densely populated. Its capital is Lincoln, and its most populous city is Omaha, which is on the Missouri River. Nebraska was admitted into the United States in 1867, two years after the end of the American Civil War. The Nebraska Legislature is unlike any other American legislature in that it is unicameral, and its members are elected without any official reference to political party affiliation. Nebraska is one of only two states that divide electoral college votes by district, and is not winner-take-all.

Nebraska is composed of two major land regions: the Dissected Till Plains and the Great Plains. The Dissected Till Plains region consists of gently rolling hills and contains the state&#x27;s largest cities, Omaha and Lincoln. The Great Plains region, occupying most of western Nebraska, is characterized by treeless prairie. Eastern Nebraska has a humid continental climate while western Nebraska is primarily semi-arid. The state has wide variations between winter and summer temperatures; the variations decrease in southern Nebraska. Violent thunderstorms and tornadoes occur primarily during spring and summer, and sometimes in autumn. The Chinook wind tends to warm the state significantly in the winter and early spring.

Indigenous peoples, including Omaha, Missouria, Ponca, Pawnee, Otoe, and various branches of the Lakota (Sioux) tribes, lived in the region for thousands of years before European discovery and exploration. The state is crossed by many historic trails, including that of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The completion of the Transcontinental Railroad through Nebraska and passage of the Homestead Acts led to rapid growth in the population of American settlers in the 1870s and 1880s and the development of a large agriculture sector for which the state is known to this day.

==Etymology==
Nebraska&#x27;s name is the result of anglicization of the archaic Otoe (contemporary Otoe: ; pronounced ), or the Omaha , (pronounced ), meaning &quot;flat water&quot;, after the Platte River which flows through the state.

==History==


=== Early history ===
Indigenous peoples lived in the region of present-day Nebraska for thousands of years before European colonization. The historic tribes in the state included the Omaha, Missouria, Ponca, Pawnee, Otoe, and various branches of the Lakota (Sioux), some of which migrated from eastern areas into the region. When European exploration, trade, and settlement began, both Spain and France sought to control the region. In the 1690s, Spain established trade connections with the Apache, whose territory then included western Nebraska. By 1703, France had developed a regular trade with native peoples along the Missouri River in Nebraska, and by 1719 had signed treaties with several of these peoples. After war broke out between the two countries, Spain dispatched an armed expedition to Nebraska under Lieutenant General Pedro de Villasur in 1720. The party was attacked and destroyed near present-day Columbus by a large force of Pawnee and Otoe, both allied with the French. The massacre ended Spanish exploration of the area for the remainder of the 18th century.

In 1762, during the Seven Years&#x27; War, France ceded the Louisiana territory to Spain. This left Britain and Spain competing for dominance along the Mississippi River; by 1773, the British were trading with the native peoples of Nebraska. Spain dispatched two trading expeditions up the Missouri River in 1794 and 1795; the second, under James Mackay, established the first European settlement in Nebraska near the mouth of the Platte River. Later that year, Mackay&#x27;s party built a trading post, dubbed Fort Carlos IV (Fort Charles), near present-day Homer.

=== American settlement and statehood ===
In 1819, the United States established Fort Atkinson as the first U.S. Army post west of the Missouri River, just east of present-day Fort Calhoun. The army abandoned the fort in 1827 as migration moved further west. European-American settlement was scarce until 1848 and the California Gold Rush. On May 30, 1854, the U.S. Congress created the Kansas and the Nebraska territories, divided by the Parallel 40° North, under the Kansas–Nebraska Act. The Nebraska Territory included parts of the current states of Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana. The territorial capital of Nebraska was Omaha.
Late 19th century

In the 1860s, after the U.S. government forced many of the American Indian tribes to cede their lands and settle on reservations, it opened large tracts of land to agricultural development by European immigrants and American settlers. Under the Homestead Act, thousands of settlers migrated into Nebraska to claim free land granted by the federal government. Because so few trees grew on the prairies, many of the first farming settlers built their homes of sod, as had Native Americans such as the Omaha. The first wave of settlement gave the territory a sufficient population to apply for statehood. Nebraska became the 37th state on March 1, 1867, and the capital was moved from Omaha to the center at Lancaster, later renamed Lincoln after the recently assassinated President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. The battle of Massacre Canyon, on August 5, 1873, was the last major battle between the Pawnee and the Sioux.

During the 1870s to the 1880s, Nebraska experienced a large growth in population. Several factors contributed to attracting new residents. The first was that the vast prairie land was perfect for cattle grazing. This helped settlers to learn the unfamiliar geography of the area. The second factor was the invention of several farming technologies. New agricultural innovations such as barbed wire, windmills, and the steel plow, combined with fair weather, enabled settlers to transform Nebraska into prime farming land. By the 1880s, Nebraska&#x27;s population had soared to more than 450,000 people. The Arbor Day holiday was founded in Nebraska City by territorial governor J. Sterling Morton. The National Arbor Day Foundation is still headquartered in Nebraska City, with some offices in Lincoln.

In the late 19th century, African Americans migrated from the South to Nebraska as part of the Great Migration. Eventually, they moved primarily to Omaha which offered working-class jobs in meat packing, the railroads and other industries. Omaha has a long history of civil rights activism. Blacks encountered discrimination from other Americans in Omaha and especially from recent European immigrants who were also competing for the same jobs as well.

=== 20th century ===
During the early 20th century, In 1912, African Americans founded the Omaha chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to work for improved conditions in the city and state. During the Omaha Race Riots in 1919, many white rioters protested throughout Omaha due to there being an incident in which a black man was accused of sexually assaulting a white woman. The Great Depression also had greatly affected the residents of Nebraska at the time. From 1930 to 1936 the dust bowl was common in the state due to there being a drought, wind, and dirt being dug up throughout all of the Midwestern United States. Residents in Nebraska had passed an initiative in 1934, then the first session in the unicameral was held in 1937. Kay Orr was elected Nebraska&#x27;s first female governor on November 4, 1986.

==Geography==


The state is bordered by South Dakota to the north; Iowa to the east and Missouri to the southeast, across the Missouri River; Kansas to the south; Colorado to the southwest; and Wyoming to the west. The state has 93 counties and is split between two time zones, with the majority of the state observing Central Time and the Panhandle and surrounding counties observing Mountain Time. Three rivers cross the state from west to east. The Platte River, formed by the confluence of the North Platte and the South Platte, runs through the state&#x27;s central portion, the Niobrara River flows through the northern part, and the Republican River runs across the southern part.

The first Constitution of Nebraska in 1866 described Nebraska&#x27;s boundaries as follows (The description of the Northern border is no longer accurate, since the Keya Paha River and the Niobrara River no longer form the boundary of the state of Nebraska. Instead, Nebraska&#x27;s Northern border now extends east along the forty-third degree of north latitude until it meets the Missouri River directly.): 

Nebraska is composed of two major land regions: the Dissected Till Plains and the Great Plains. The easternmost portion of the state was scoured by Ice Age glaciers; the Dissected Till Plains were left after the glaciers retreated. The Dissected Till Plains is a region of gently rolling hills; Omaha and Lincoln are in this region. The Great Plains occupy most of western Nebraska, with the region consisting of several smaller, diverse land regions, including the Sandhills, the Pine Ridge, the Rainwater Basin, the High Plains and the Wildcat Hills. Panorama Point, at , is Nebraska&#x27;s highest point; though despite its name and elevation, it is a relatively low rise near the Colorado and Wyoming borders. A past tourism slogan for the state of Nebraska was &quot;Where the West Begins&quot; (it has since been changed to &quot;Honestly, it&#x27;s not for everyone&quot;). Locations given for the beginning of the &quot;West&quot; in Nebraska include the Missouri River, the intersection of 13th and O Streets in Lincoln (where it is marked by a red brick star), the 100th meridian, and Chimney Rock.

===Federal land management===

Areas under the management of the National Park Service include:

* Oregon National Historic Trail
* Pony Express National Historic Trail
* Scotts Bluff National Monument at Gering

Areas under the management of the National Forest Service include:
* Nebraska National Forest
* Oglala National Grassland
* Samuel R. McKelvie National Forest

===Climate===


Two major climatic zones are represented in Nebraska. The eastern two-thirds of the state has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;), although the southwest of this region may be classed as a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) using the near the Kansas state line, analogous to the predominantly humid subtropical climate of Kansas and Oklahoma. Western Nebraska, including The Panhandle and adjacent areas bordering Colorado have a semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;). The entire state experiences wide seasonal variations in both temperature and precipitation. Average temperatures are fairly uniform across Nebraska, with hot summers and generally cold winters. However, chinook winds from the Rocky Mountains provide a temporary moderating effect on temperatures in the state&#x27;s western portion during the winter. Thus, average January maximum temperatures are highest at around in southwestern Dundy County, and lowest at about around South Sioux City in the northeast.

Average annual precipitation decreases east to west from about in the southeast corner of the state to about in the Panhandle. Humidity also decreases significantly from east to west. Snowfall across the state is fairly even, with most of Nebraska receiving between of snow each year. Nebraska&#x27;s highest-recorded temperature was in Minden on July 24, 1936. The state&#x27;s lowest-recorded temperature was in Camp Clarke on February 12, 1899.

Nebraska is located in Tornado Alley. Thunderstorms are common during both the spring and the summer. Violent thunderstorms and tornadoes happen primarily during those two seasons, although they also can occur occasionally during the autumn.

=== Settlements ===
Eighty-nine percent of the cities in Nebraska have fewer than 3,000 people. Nebraska shares this characteristic with five other Midwestern states: Kansas, Oklahoma, North Dakota and South Dakota, and Iowa. Hundreds of towns have a population of fewer than 1,000. Regional population declines have forced many rural schools to consolidate.

Fifty-three of Nebraska&#x27;s 93 counties reported declining populations between 1990 and 2000, ranging from a 0.06% loss (Frontier County) to a 17.04% loss (Hitchcock County).
More urbanized areas of the state have experienced substantial growth. In 2000, the city of Omaha had a population of 390,007; in 2005, the city&#x27;s estimated population was 414,521 (427,872 including the recently annexed city of Elkhorn), a 6.3% increase over five years. The 2010 census showed that Omaha has a population of 408,958. The city of Lincoln had a 2000 population of 225,581 and a 2010 population of 258,379, a 14.5% increase.

As of the 2010 census, there were 530 cities and villages in the state of Nebraska. There are five classifications of cities and villages in Nebraska, which are based upon population. All population figures are 2017 Census Bureau estimates unless flagged by a reference number.

===Population===

The 2020 United States census reported that the population of Nebraska was 1,961,504 on April 1, 2020, a 7.4% increase since the 2010 United States census. The center of population of Nebraska is in Polk County, in the city of Shelby.

According to HUD&#x27;s 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 2,246 homeless people in Nebraska.

The table below shows the racial composition of Nebraska&#x27;s population as of 2022.

According to the 2016 American Community Survey, 10.2% of Nebraska&#x27;s population were of Hispanic or Latino origin (of any race): Mexican (7.8%), Puerto Rican (0.2%), Cuban (0.2%), and other Hispanic or Latino origin (2.0%). The largest ancestry groups were: German (36.1%), Irish (13.1%), English (7.8%), Czech (4.7%), Swedish (4.3%), and Polish (3.5%).

Nebraska has the largest Czech American and non-Mormon Danish American population (as a percentage of the total population) in the nation. Nebraska is also home to the largest Polish American population in the Great Plains. German Americans are the largest ancestry group in most of the state, particularly in the eastern counties. Thurston County (made up entirely of the Omaha and Winnebago reservations) has an American Indian majority, and Butler County is one of only two counties in the nation with a Czech-American plurality.

In recent years, Nebraska has become home to many refugee communities. In 2016, it welcomed more refugees per capita than any other state. Nebraska, and in particular Lincoln, is the largest home of Yazidis refugees and Yazidi Americans in the United States.

Notably, Nebraska was the last of all 50 states to maintain a ban on the issuance of driver&#x27;s licenses to adults who had entered the United States illegally as children (also known as Dreamers). The state legislature lifted the ban in December 2016.

Mexico, India, China, Guatemala, and El Salvador are top countries of origin for Nebraska&#x27;s immigrants.

====Birth data====

As of 2011, 31.0% of Nebraska&#x27;s population younger than ageone were minorities.

&quot;Note: For 2013–2015, births in table don&#x27;t add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number. Since 2016, data for births of White Hispanic origin are not collected, but included in one &quot;Hispanic&quot; group; persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.&quot;

===Religion===
The religious affiliations of the people of Nebraska are predominantly Christian, according to a 2014 survey by the Pew Research Center. At the 2020 Public Religion Research Institute survey, 73% of the population identified as Christian. At the 2014 Pew Research Center&#x27;s survey, 20% of the population were religiously unaffiliated; in 2020, the Public Religion Research Institute determined 22% of the population became religiously unaffiliated.

The largest single denominations by number of adherents in 2010 were the Roman Catholic Church (372,838), the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (112,585), the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (110,110) and the United Methodist Church (109,283).

==Taxation==

Nebraska has a progressive income tax. The portion of income from $0 to $2,400 is taxed at 2.56%; from $2,400 to $17,500, at 3.57%; from $17,500 to $27,000, at 5.12%; and income over $27,000, at 6.84%. The standard deduction for a single taxpayer is $5,700; the personal exemption is $118.

Nebraska has a state sales and use tax of 5.5%. In addition to the state tax, some Nebraska cities assess a city sales and use tax, in 0.5% increments, up to a maximum of 1.5%. Dakota County levies an additional 0.5% county sales tax. Food and ingredients that are generally for home preparation and consumption are not taxable. All real property within the state of Nebraska is taxable unless specifically exempted by statute. Since 1992, only depreciable personal property is subject to tax and all other personal property is exempt from tax. Inheritance tax is collected at the county level.

==Economy==


* Total employment (2016): 884,450
* Total employer establishments: 54,265

The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates of Nebraska&#x27;s gross state product in 2010 was $89.8 billion. Per capita personal income in 2004 was $31,339, 25th in the nation. Nebraska has a large agriculture sector, and is a major producer of beef, pork, wheat, corn (maize), soybeans, and sorghum. Other important economic sectors include freight transport (by rail and truck), manufacturing, telecommunications, information technology, and insurance.

In October 2021, Nebraska recorded an unemployment rate of 1.9%, the lowest ever recorded for any state.

===Industry===

Kool-Aid was created in 1927 by Edwin Perkins in the city of Hastings, which celebrates the event the second weekend of every August with Kool-Aid Days, and Kool-Aid is the official soft drink of Nebraska. &quot;CliffsNotes&quot; were developed by Clifton Hillegass of Rising City. He adapted his pamphlets from the Canadian publications, &quot;Coles Notes&quot;.

Omaha is home to Berkshire Hathaway, whose chief executive officer (CEO), Warren Buffett, was ranked in March 2009 by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine as the second-richest person in the world. The city is also home to Mutual of Omaha, InfoUSA, West Corporation, Valmont Industries, Woodmen of the World, Kiewit Corporation, Union Pacific Railroad, and Gallup. Ameritas Life Insurance Corp., Nelnet, Sandhills Publishing Company, Duncan Aviation, and Hudl are based in Lincoln. The Buckle is based in Kearney. Sidney is the national headquarters for Cabela&#x27;s, a specialty retailer of outdoor goods now owned by Bass Pro Shops. Grand Island is the headquarters of Hornady, a manufacturer of ammunition.

The world&#x27;s largest train yard, Union Pacific&#x27;s Bailey Yard, is in North Platte. The Vise-Grip was invented by William Petersen in 1924, and was manufactured in De Witt until the plant was closed and moved to China in late 2008.

Lincoln&#x27;s Kawasaki Motors Manufacturing is the only Kawasaki plant in the world to produce the Jet Ski, all-terrain vehicle (ATV), and MULE product lines. The facility employs more than 1,200 people.

The Spade Ranch, in the Sandhills, is one of Nebraska&#x27;s oldest and largest beef cattle operations.

===Energy===
Nebraska has been the nation&#x27;s second-largest producer of ethanol biofuels. It has few fossil-fuel resources except for crude oil from the Niobrara Formation which underlays a portion of the state&#x27;s western region. It hosts one uranium leach mining operation near its northwest border with Wyoming. It has an abundance of renewable generation resources, including untapped biomass generation potential from its productive agriculture industry. It has been a top-ten state for per-capita energy consumption due in large part to its energy-intensive agriculture, meat packing, and food processing industries.

Nebraska is the only state in the US where all electric utilities are publicly owned. Half of its electricity is generated from coal and the fastest-growing source in recent years has been wind. Nebraska has no renewable portfolio standard while supporting net metering.

==Transportation==

===Railroads===

The Union Pacific Railroad, headquartered in Omaha, was incorporated on July 1, 1862, in the wake of the Pacific Railway Act of 1862. Bailey Yard, in North Platte, is the largest railroad classification yard in the world. The route of the original transcontinental railroad runs through the state.

Other major railroads with operations in the state are Amtrak; BNSF Railway; Canadian National Railway; and Iowa Interstate Railroad.

==Law and government==
















The Government of Nebraska operates under the framework of the Nebraska Constitution, adopted in 1875, and is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.

===Executive branch===
The head of the executive branch is Governor Jim Pillen (Republican). The Governor of Nebraska is the head of government of the U.S. state of Nebraska as provided by the fourth article of the Constitution of Nebraska. Other elected officials in the executive branch are Lieutenant Governor Joe Kelly, Attorney General Mike Hilgers, Secretary of State Bob Evnen, State Treasurer John Murante, and State Auditor Mike Foley. All elected officials in the executive branch serve four-year terms.

===Legislative branch===

Nebraska is the only state in the United States with a &#x27;single-house&#x27; unicameral legislature. Although this house is officially known simply as the &quot;Legislature&quot;, and more commonly called the &quot;Unicameral&quot;, its members call themselves &quot;senators&quot;. Nebraska&#x27;s Legislature is also the only state legislature in the United States that is officially nonpartisan. The senators are elected with no party affiliation next to their names on the ballot, and members of any party can be elected to the positions of speaker and committee chairs. The Nebraska Legislature can also override the governor&#x27;s veto with a three-fifths majority, in contrast to the two-thirds majority required in some other states.

When Nebraska became a state in 1867, its legislature consisted of two houses: a House of Representatives and a Senate. For years, U.S. Senator George Norris (Senator 1913–1943) and other Nebraskans encouraged the idea of a unicameral legislature and demanded the issue be decided in a referendum. Norris argued:
 Unicameral supporters also argued that a bicameral legislature had a significant undemocratic feature in the committees that reconciled House and Senate legislation. Votes in these committees were secretive, and would sometimes add provisions to bills that neither house had approved. Nebraska&#x27;s unicameral legislature today has rules that bills can contain only one subject, and must be given at least five days of consideration. In 1934, due in part to the budgetary pressure of the Great Depression, Nebraska citizens ran a state initiative to vote on a constitutional amendment creating a unicameral legislature, which was approved, which, in effect, abolished the House of Representatives (the lower house).

The Legislature meets in the third Nebraska State Capitol building, built between 1922 and 1932. It was designed by Bertram G. Goodhue. Built from Indiana limestone, the capitol&#x27;s base is a cross within a square. A 400-foot (122 m) domed tower rises from this base. The Sower, a 19-foot (5.8 m) bronze statue representing agriculture, crowns the building.

===Judicial branch===
The judicial system in Nebraska is unified, with the Nebraska Supreme Court having administrative authority over all the courts within the state. Nebraska uses the Missouri Plan for the selection of judges at all levels, including county courts (as the lowest-level courts) and twelve district courts, which contain one or more counties. The Court of Appeals hears appeals from the district courts, juvenile courts, and workers&#x27; compensation courts.

===Federal representation===


Nebraska is represented in the U.S. Senate by Republican Deb Fischer, who was first elected in 2012. Nebraska&#x27;s other Senate seat is currently held by Pete Ricketts, who took office on January 23, 2023.

Nebraska has three representative seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Until the next election, Nebraska&#x27;s representatives are Mike Flood (R) of the 1st district, Don Bacon (R) of the 2nd district, and Adrian Smith (R) of the 3rd district.

Nebraska is one of two states (Maine is the other) that allow for a split in the state&#x27;s allocation of electoral votes in presidential elections. Under a 1991 law, two of Nebraska&#x27;s five votes are awarded to the winner of the statewide popular vote, while the other three go to the highest vote-getter in each of the state&#x27;s three congressional districts.

===Politics===
For most of its history, Nebraska has been a solidly Republican state. Republicans have carried the state in all but one presidential election since 1940: the 1964 landslide election of Lyndon B. Johnson. In the 2004 presidential election, George W. Bush won the state&#x27;s five electoral votes by a margin of 33 percentage points (making Nebraska&#x27;s the fourth-strongest Republican vote among states) with 65.9% of the overall vote; only Thurston County, which is majority-Native American, voted for his Democratic challenger John Kerry. In 2008, the state split its electoral votes for the first time: Republican John McCain won the popular vote in Nebraska as a whole and two of its three congressional districts; the second district, which includes the city of Omaha, went for Democrat Barack Obama. Since then, the state has split its electoral vote twice, with the second district going for the Democratic Party candidates Joe Biden in 2020 and Kamala Harris in 2024.

Despite the current Republican domination of Nebraska politics, the state has a long tradition of electing centrist members of both parties to state and federal office; examples include George W. Norris (who served a few years in the Senate as an independent), J. James Exon, Bob Kerrey, and Chuck Hagel. Voters have tilted to the right in recent years, a trend evidenced when Hagel retired from the Senate in 2008 and was succeeded by conservative Republican Mike Johanns to the U.S. Senate, as well as with the 2006 re-election of Ben Nelson, who was considered the most conservative Democrat in the Senate until his retirement in 2013. Johanns retired in 2015 and was succeeded by Ben Sasse, while Nelson retired in 2013 and was succeeded by Deb Fischer, both conservative Republicans.

Though its politics are generally conservative, the state also has a history of progressive reform. Nebraska was the first U.S. state to outlaw sexual assault within a marriage, in 1975. In 1980 it became the first U.S. state to divest from South Africa to protest the racist system of apartheid.

Former President Gerald Ford was born in Nebraska but moved away shortly after birth. Illinois native William Jennings Bryan represented Nebraska in Congress, served as U.S. Secretary of State under President Woodrow Wilson, and unsuccessfully ran for president three times. Former Vice President Dick Cheney was born in Lincoln but moved to Casper.

<text>New Jersey is a state located in both the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern regions of the United States, at the geographic hub of the heavily urbanized Northeast megalopolis. New Jersey is bordered to the northwest, north, and northeast by New York State; on its east, southeast, and south by the Atlantic Ocean; on its west by the Delaware River and Pennsylvania; and on its southwest by Delaware Bay and Delaware. At , New Jersey is the fifth-smallest state in land area, but with over 9.5 million residents as of 2024 U.S. Census Bureau estimates, its highest population ever, the state ranks 11th in population. The state capital is Trenton, and the state&#x27;s most populous city is Newark. New Jersey is the only U.S. state in which every county is deemed urban by the U.S. Census Bureau, and is the most densely populated U.S. state.

New Jersey was first inhabited by Paleo-Indians as early as 13,000 B.C.E. The Lenape were the dominant Indigenous group when Europeans arrived in the early 17th century, and they were subdivided into dialectal groups such as the Munsee, in the north, and the Unami and the Unalachtigo, elsewhere. Dutch and Swedish colonists founded the first European settlements in the state, with the British later seizing control of the region and establishing the Province of New Jersey, named after Jersey. The colony&#x27;s fertile lands and relative religious tolerance drew a large and diverse population. New Jersey was among the Thirteen Colonies that supported the American Revolution, hosting several pivotal battles and military commands in the American Revolutionary War. New Jersey remained in the Union during the American Civil War and provided troops, resources, and military leaders in support of the Union Army. After the war, the state emerged as a major manufacturing center and a leading destination for immigrants, helping drive the Industrial Revolution in the U.S. New Jersey was the site of many industrial, technological, and commercial innovations. Many prominent Americans associated with New Jersey have proven influential nationally and globally, including in academia, advocacy, business, entertainment, government, military, non-profit leadership, and other fields.

New Jersey&#x27;s central location in the Northeast megalopolis helped fuel its rapid growth and suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the state&#x27;s economy has become highly diversified, with major sectors including biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, information technology, finance, and tourism, and it has become an Atlantic seaboard epicenter for logistics and distribution. New Jersey remains a major destination for immigrants and is home to one of the world&#x27;s most multicultural populations. Echoing historical trends, the state has increasingly re-urbanized, with growth in cities outpacing suburbs since 2008.

New Jersey is one of the most educated, affluent, healthy, diverse and highly developed states in the U.S., ranking it high in several quality of life metrics. As of 2022, New Jersey had the highest annual median household income, at $96,346, of all 50 states. Almost one-tenth of all households in the state, or over 323,000, are millionaires, the highest representation of millionaires among all states. New Jersey&#x27;s public school system consistently ranks at or among the top of all U.S. states. In 2024, New Jersey was ranked as having the second-healthiest population overall. New Jersey ranks near the top on both the American Human Development Index and the standard Human Development Index. According to climatology research by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, New Jersey has been the fastest-warming state by average air temperature over a 100-year period beginning in the early 20th century, which has been attributed to warming of the North Atlantic Ocean.

==History==
===Prehistoric era===

The pressure of collision between North America and Africa gave rise to the Appalachian Mountains. Around 18,000 years ago, the Ice Age resulted in glaciers that reached New Jersey. As glaciers retreated, they left behind Lake Passaic along with rivers, meadows, swamps, and gorges.

Since the 6th millennium BC, Native American people have inhabited New Jersey, beginning with the Lenape tribe. &quot;&quot; is the Lenape name for the land that represents present-day New Jersey. The Lenape were several autonomous groups that practiced maize agriculture in order to supplement their hunting and gathering in the region surrounding the Delaware River, the lower Hudson River, and western Long Island Sound. The Lenape were divided into matrilineal clans that were based upon common female ancestors. Clans were organized into three distinct phratries identified by their animal sign: Turtle, Turkey, and Wolf. They first encountered the Dutch in the early 17th century, and their primary relationship with the Dutch and later European settlers was through fur trade.

===Colonial era===
The Dutch were the first Europeans to lay claim to lands in New Jersey. The Dutch colony of New Netherland consisted of parts of the modern Mid-Atlantic states. Although the European principle of land ownership was not recognized by the Lenape, Dutch West India Company policy required its colonists to purchase land that they settled. The first to do so was Michiel Pauw, who established a patron ship called Pavonia in 1630 along North River, that eventually became Bergen. Peter Minuit&#x27;s purchase of lands along the Delaware River established the colony of New Sweden, that lasted until the Dutch conquered it in 1655. Then the entire region became a territory of England on June 24, 1664, after an English fleet under command of Colonel Richard Nicolls sailed into what is now New York Harbor and took control of Fort Amsterdam, annexing the entire province.

During the English Civil War, the Channel Island of Jersey remained loyal to the British Crown and gave sanctuary to the King. In the Royal Square in St Helier, Charles II of England was proclaimed King in 1649, following the execution of his father, Charles I. North American lands were divided by Charles II, who gave his brother, the Duke of York (later King James II), the region between New England and Maryland as a proprietary colony (as opposed to a royal colony). James then granted land between the Hudson River and the Delaware River (the land that would become New Jersey) to two friends who had remained loyal through the English Civil War: Sir George Carteret and Lord Berkeley of Stratton. The area was named the Province of New Jersey.

Since its inception, New Jersey has been characterized by ethnic and religious diversity. New England Congregationalists settled alongside Scots Presbyterians and Dutch Reformed migrants. While the majority of residents lived in towns with individual landholdings of , a few rich proprietors owned vast estates. English Quakers and Anglicans owned large landholdings. Unlike Plymouth Colony, Jamestown and other colonies, New Jersey was populated by a secondary wave of immigrants who came from other colonies instead of those who migrated directly from Europe. New Jersey remained agrarian and rural throughout the colonial era, and commercial farming developed sporadically. Some townships, such as Burlington on the Delaware River and Perth Amboy, emerged as important ports for shipping to New York City and Philadelphia. The colony&#x27;s fertile lands and tolerant religious policy drew more settlers, and New Jersey&#x27;s population had increased to 120,000 by 1775.

Settlement for the first ten years of English rule took place along the Hackensack River and Arthur Kill. Settlers came primarily from New York and New England. On March 18, 1673, Berkeley sold his half of the colony to Quakers in England, who settled the Delaware Valley region as a Quaker colony, with William Penn acting as trustee for the lands for a time. New Jersey was governed as two distinct provinces, East and West Jersey, for 28 years between 1674 and 1702, which were part of the Dominion of New England from 1686 to 1689.

In 1702, the two provinces were reunited under a royal governor rather than a proprietary one. Edward Hyde, titled Lord Cornbury, became the first governor of the royal colony. Britain believed that he was an ineffective and corrupt ruler, taking bribes and speculating on land. In 1708, he was recalled to England. New Jersey was then ruled by the governors of New York, but this infuriated the settlers of New Jersey, who accused these governors of favoritism to New York. Judge Lewis Morris led the case for a separate governor, and was appointed governor by King George II in 1738.

===Revolutionary War era===

New Jersey was one of the Thirteen Colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution. The was passed July 2, 1776, just two days before the Second Continental Congress declared American Independence from Great Britain. It was an act of the Provincial Congress, which made itself into the State Legislature. To reassure neutrals, it provided that it would become the legislature would disband if New Jersey reached reconciliation with Great Britain. Among the 56 Founding Fathers who signed the Declaration of Independence, five were New Jersey representatives: Richard Stockton, John Witherspoon, Francis Hopkinson, John Hart, and Abraham Clark.

During the American Revolutionary War, British and American armies crossed New Jersey numerous times, and several pivotal battles took place in the state. Because of this, New Jersey today is sometimes referred to as &quot;The Crossroads of the American Revolution&quot;. The winter quarters of the Continental Army were established in New Jersey twice by General George Washington in Morristown, which has been called &quot;The Military Capital of the American Revolution.&quot;

On the night of December 25–26, 1776, the Continental Army under George Washington crossed the Delaware River. After the crossing, they surprised and defeated the Hessian troops in the Battle of Trenton. Slightly more than a week after victory at Trenton, Continental Army forces gained an important victory by stopping General Cornwallis&#x27;s charges at the Second Battle of Trenton. By evading Cornwallis&#x27;s army, the Continental Army was able to make a surprise attack on Princeton and successfully defeated the British forces there on January 3, 1777. Emanuel Leutze&#x27;s painting of &quot;Washington Crossing the Delaware&quot; became an icon of the Revolution.

Continental Army forces under Washington&#x27;s command met British forces under General Henry Clinton at the Battle of Monmouth in an indecisive engagement in June 1778. Washington&#x27;s forces attempted to take the British column by surprise. When the British army attempted to flank the Americans, the Continental Army retreated in disorder. Their ranks were later reorganized and withstood British charges.

In the summer of 1783, the Continental Congress met in Nassau Hall at Princeton University, making Princeton the nation&#x27;s capital for four months. It was there that the Continental Congress learned of the signing of the Treaty of Paris, which ended the war.

On December 18, 1787, New Jersey became the third state to ratify the United States Constitution, which was overwhelmingly popular in New Jersey since it prevented New York and Pennsylvania from charging tariffs on goods imported from Europe. On November 20, 1789, New Jersey became the first in the newly formed Union to ratify the Bill of Rights.

The 1776 New Jersey State Constitution gave the vote to all inhabitants who had a certain level of wealth. This included women and Black people, but not married women because they were not legally permitted to own property separately from their husbands. Both sides, in several elections, claimed that the other side had had unqualified women vote and mocked them for use of petticoat electors, whether entitled to vote or not; on the other hand, both parties passed Voting Rights Acts. In 1807, legislature passed a bill interpreting the constitution to mean universal white male suffrage, excluding paupers; the constitution was itself an act of the legislature and not enshrined as the modern constitution.

===19th century===
On February 15, 1804, New Jersey became the last northern state to abolish new slavery and enacted legislation that slowly phased out existing slavery. This led to a gradual decrease of the slave population. By the American Civil War&#x27;s end, about a dozen African Americans in New Jersey were still held in bondage. New Jersey voters eventually ratified the constitutional amendments banning slavery and granting rights to the United States&#x27; black population.

Industrialization accelerated in the present-day North Jersey region of the state following completion of the Morris Canal in 1831. The canal allowed for anthracite coal to be transported from eastern Pennsylvania&#x27;s Lehigh Valley to North Jersey&#x27;s growing industries in Paterson, Newark, and Jersey City.

In 1844, the second state constitution was ratified and brought into effect. Counties thereby became districts for the state senate, and some realignment of boundaries (including the creation of Mercer County) immediately followed. This provision was retained in the 1947 Constitution, but was overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1962, by the decision &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot;. While the Governorship was stronger than under the 1776 constitution, the constitution of 1844 created many offices that were not responsible to him, or to the people, and it gave him a three-year term, but he could not succeed himself.

New Jersey was one of the few Union states (the others being Delaware and Kentucky) to select a candidate other than Abraham Lincoln twice in national elections, and sided with Stephen A. Douglas (1860) and George B. McClellan (1864) during their campaigns. McClellan, a native Philadelphian, had New Jersey ties and formally resided in New Jersey at the time; he later became Governor of New Jersey (1878–81). (In New Jersey, the factions of the Democratic party managed an effective coalition in 1860.) During the American Civil War, the state was led first by Republican governor Charles Smith Olden, then by Democrat Joel Parker. During the course of the war, between 65,000 and 80,000 soldiers from the state enlisted in the Union army; unlike many states, including some Northern ones, no battle was fought there.

In the Industrial Revolution, cities like Paterson grew and prospered. Previously, the economy had been largely agrarian, which was problematically subject to crop failures and poor soil. This caused a shift to a more industrialized economy, one based on manufactured commodities such as textiles and silk. Inventor Thomas Edison also became an important figure of the Industrial Revolution, having been granted 1,093 patents, many of which for inventions he developed while working in New Jersey. Edison&#x27;s facilities, first at Menlo Park and then in West Orange, are considered perhaps the first research centers in the United States. Christie Street in Menlo Park was the first thoroughfare in the world to have electric lighting. Transportation was greatly improved as locomotion and steamboats were introduced to New Jersey.

Iron mining was also a leading industry during the middle to late 19th century. Bog iron pits in the New Jersey Pine Barrens were among the first sources of iron for the new nation. Mines such as Mt. Hope, Mine Hill, and the Rockaway Valley Mines created a thriving industry. Mining generated the impetus for new towns and was one of the driving forces behind the need for the Morris Canal. Zinc mines were also a major industry, especially the Sterling Hill Mine.

===20th century===

New Jersey prospered through the Roaring Twenties. The first Miss America Pageant was held in 1921 in Atlantic City; the Holland Tunnel connecting Jersey City to Manhattan opened in 1927; and the first drive-in movie was shown in 1933 in Camden. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the state offered begging licenses to unemployed residents, the zeppelin airship Hindenburg crashed in flames over Lakehurst, and the SS &quot;Morro Castle&quot; beached itself near Asbury Park after going up in flames while at sea.

Through both World Wars, New Jersey was a center for war production, especially naval construction. The Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company yards in Kearny and Newark and the New York Shipbuilding Corporation yard in Camden produced aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and destroyers. New Jersey manufactured 6.8 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking fifth among the 48 states. In addition, Fort Dix (1917) (originally called &quot;Camp Dix&quot;), Camp Merritt (1917), and Camp Kilmer (1941) were all constructed to house and train American soldiers through both World Wars. New Jersey also became a principal location for defense in the Cold War. Fourteen Nike missile stations were constructed for the defense of the New York City and Philadelphia areas. &quot;PT-109&quot;, a motor torpedo boat commanded by Lt. (j.g.) John F. Kennedy in World War II, was built at the Elco Boatworks in Bayonne. The aircraft carrier USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (CV-6) was briefly docked at the Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne in the 1950s before she was sent to Kearney to be scrapped. In 1962, the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered cargo ship, the NS Savannah, was launched at Camden.

In 1951, the New Jersey Turnpike opened, facilitating efficient travel by car and truck between North Jersey and metropolitan New York, and South Jersey and metropolitan Philadelphia. Subsequently, in 1957, the Garden State Parkway was completed, serving as a diagonal counterpart to the Turnpike, and opening up highway travel along New Jersey&#x27;s coastal flank between Bergen County in the northeast and the Cape May County peninsula at the southeastern tip of New Jersey; in doing so, the Jersey Shore became readily accessible to millions of residents in the New York metropolitan area. In 1959, Air Defense Command deployed the CIM-10 Bomarc surface-to-air missile to McGuire Air Force Base. On June 7, 1960, an explosion in a CIM-10 Bomarc missile fuel tank caused an accident and subsequent plutonium contamination.

In the 1960s, race riots erupted in many of the industrial cities of North Jersey. The first race riots in New Jersey occurred in Jersey City on August 2, 1964. Several others ensued in 1967, in Newark and Plainfield. Other riots followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968, just as in the rest of the country. A riot occurred in Camden in 1971. As a result of an order from the New Jersey Supreme Court to fund schools equitably, the New Jersey legislature passed an income tax bill in 1976. Prior to this bill, the state had no income tax.

===21st century===

In the early part of the 2000s, two light rail systems were opened: the Hudson–Bergen Light Rail in Hudson County and the River Line between Camden and Trenton. The intent of these projects was to encourage transit-oriented development in North Jersey and South Jersey, respectively. The HBLR was credited with a revitalization of Hudson County and Jersey City. Urban revitalization has continued in North Jersey in the 21st century. In 2014, Jersey City&#x27;s Census-estimated population was 262,146, with the largest population increase of any municipality in New Jersey since 2010, representing an increase of 5.9% from the 2010 U.S. census, when the city&#x27;s population was enumerated at 247,597. Between 2000 and 2010 Newark experienced its first population increase since the 1950s, and by 2020 had rebounded to 311,549.

==Geography==


New Jersey is located at the center of the Northeast megalopolis, the most populated American urban agglomeration. It is bordered on the north and northeast by New York (parts of which are across the Hudson River, Upper New York Bay, the Kill Van Kull, Newark Bay, and the Arthur Kill); on the east by the Atlantic Ocean; on the southwest by Delaware across Delaware Bay; and on the west by Pennsylvania across the Delaware River.

New Jersey is broadly divided into the North, Central, and South Jersey geographic regions, although some residents do not consider Central Jersey a region in its own right. Across the regions are five distinct areas divided by natural geography and population concentration. Northeastern New Jersey, often referred to as the Gateway Region, lies closest to Manhattan in New York City, and up to a million residents commute daily into the city for work, many via public transportation. The Jersey Shore, along the Atlantic Coast in Central and South Jersey, has its own unique natural, residential, and cultural characteristics owing to its location by the ocean. South Jersey represents the southernmost geographical region of the northeastern United States. The Delaware Valley includes the southwestern counties of the state, which reside within the Delaware Valley surrounding Philadelphia.

Despite its heavily urban character and a long history of industrialization, forests cover roughly 45 percent of New Jersey&#x27;s land area, or approximately , ranking 31st among the 50 U.S. states and six territories. Northwestern New Jersey, often referred to as the Skylands Region, is more wooded, rural, and mountainous. The chief tree of the northern forests is the oak. The New Jersey Pine Barrens is situated in the southern interior of New Jersey and covered extensively by mixed pine and oak forest; its population density is lower than most of the state.

High Point in Montague Township, Sussex County is the state&#x27;s highest elevation at above sea level. The state&#x27;s highest prominence is Kitty Ann Mountain in Morris County, rising . The Palisades are a line of steep cliffs on the west side of the Hudson River in Bergen and Hudson Counties. Major New Jersey rivers include the Hudson, Delaware, Raritan, Passaic, Hackensack, Rahway, Musconetcong, Mullica, Rancocas, Manasquan, Maurice, and Toms rivers. Due to New Jersey&#x27;s peninsular geography, both sunrise and sunset are visible over water from different points on the Jersey Shore.

=== Climate ===
The state consists of two climate zones; most of the state has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), while the northwest has a humid continental climate (Dfa). New Jersey receives between 2,400 and 2,800 hours of sunshine annually.

Summers are typically hot and humid, with statewide average high temperatures of and lows of ; however, temperatures exceed on average 25 days each summer, exceeding in some years. Winters are usually cold, with average high temperatures of and lows of for most of the state, but temperatures can, for brief periods, fall below and sometimes rise above . Northwestern parts of the state have significantly colder winters with sub- being an almost annual occurrence. Spring and autumn may feature wide temperature variations, with lower humidity than summer. The USDA Plant Hardiness Zone classification ranges from6 in the northwest of the state, to 7B near Cape May. All-time temperature extremes recorded in New Jersey include on July 10, 1936, in Runyon, Middlesex County and on January 5, 1904, in River Vale, Bergen County.

Average annual precipitation ranges from , spread uniformly throughout the year. Average snowfall per winter season ranges from in the south and near the seacoast, in the northeast and central part of the state, to about in the northwestern highlands, but this often varies considerably from year to year. Precipitation falls on an average of 120 days a year, with 25 to 30 thunderstorms, most of which occur during the summer.

During winter and early spring, New Jersey can experience nor&#x27;easters, which are capable of causing blizzards or flooding throughout the northeastern United States. Hurricanes and tropical storms, tornadoes, and earthquakes are rare; the state was impacted by a hurricane in 1903, Tropical Storm Floyd in 1999, and Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which made landfall in the state with top winds of .

Climate change is affecting New Jersey faster than much of the rest of the United States. Climatologists at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have concluded that New Jersey has been the fastest-warming state by average air temperature over a 100-year period beginning in the early 20th century.

===Administrative divisions===
The United States Census Bureau divides New Jersey&#x27;s 21 counties into seven metropolitan statistical areas, with 20 counties included in either the New York City or Philadelphia Combined Statistical Area. Warren County is part of the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area based in eastern Pennsylvania.

==== Counties ====
The 21 counties in New Jersey, ranked by population in the 2020 United States census, are:
# Bergen County: 955,732
# Essex County: 863,728
# Middlesex County: 863,162
# Hudson County: 724,854

==== Municipalities ====
For its overall population and nation-leading population density, New Jersey has a relative paucity of classic large cities. This paradox is most pronounced in Bergen County, the state&#x27;s most populous county, whose 955,732 residents at the 2020 census inhabited 70 municipalities, of which the most populous is Hackensack, with 46,030 residents. Many urban areas extend far beyond the limits of a single large city, as New Jersey municipalities tend to be geographically small; three of the four largest cities in New Jersey by population have under of land area, and eight of the top ten, including all the top five, have a land area under . , only four municipalities had over 100,000 residents (although Edison and Woodbridge Township came very close); this number increased to seven by the 2020 census.

== Demographics ==
===Population===
Residents of New Jersey are most commonly referred to as New Jerseyans or, less commonly, as New Jerseyites. According to the 2020 U.S. census, the state had a population of 9,288,994, a 5.7% increase since the 2010 U.S. census, which counted 8,791,894 residents. The state ranked eleventh in the country by total population and first in population density, with 1,185 residents per square mile (458 per km2). Historically, New Jersey has experienced one of the fastest growth rates in the country, with its population increasing by double digits almost every decade until 1980; growth has since slowed but remained relatively robust until recently. In 2022, the Census Bureau estimated there were 6,262 fewer residents than in 2020, a decline of 0.3% from 2020, related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

New Jersey is the only state where every county is deemed urban as defined by the Census Bureau. Most residents live in the counties surrounding New York City, the nation&#x27;s largest city, Philadelphia, the nation&#x27;s sixth-largest city, or along the eastern Jersey Shore; the extreme southern and northwestern counties are relatively less dense overall. Since the 2000 census, the United States Census Bureau calculated that New Jersey&#x27;s center of population was located in East Brunswick. The state is located in the middle of the Northeast megalopolis, which has more than 50 million residents.

As of 2019, New Jersey was the third highest U.S. state measured by median household income, behind Maryland and Massachusetts; the state&#x27;s median household income was over $85,000 compared to the national average of roughly $65,000. Conversely, New Jersey&#x27;s poverty rate of 9.4% was slightly lower than the national average of 11.4%, and the sixth lowest of the fifty states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. This is attributed to several factors, including the state&#x27;s proximity to the major economic centers of New York City and Philadelphia, its hosting the highest number of millionaires both per capita and per square mile in the U.S., and the fact that it has the most scientists and engineers per square mile in the world.

According to HUD&#x27;s 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 8,752 homeless people in New Jersey. The top countries of origin for New Jersey&#x27;s immigrants in 2018 were India, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Ecuador, and the Philippines.

=== Race and ethnicity ===
New Jersey is one of the most ethnically diverse states in the United States: as of 2022, over one-fifth (21.5%) of its residents are Hispanic or Latino, 15.3% are Black, and one-tenth are Asian. One in four New Jerseyans were born abroad and more than one million (12.1%) are not fully fluent in English. Compared to the U.S. as a whole, the state is more racially and ethnically diverse and has a higher proportion of immigrants. 



New Jersey is home to roughly half a million undocumented immigrants, comprising an estimated 6.2% of the population, which in 2018 was the fifth-highest percentage of any U.S. state. The municipalities of Camden, Jersey City, and Newark are considered sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants.

New Jersey is one of the most ethnically and religiously diverse states in the United States. Nearly one-fourth of New Jerseyans (22.7%) were foreign born, compared to the national average of 13.5%. As of 2011, 56.4% of New Jersey&#x27;s children under the age of one belonged to racial or ethnic minority groups, meaning that they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white. The 2019 Vintage Year Census estimated that the state&#x27;s ethnic makeup was as follows: 71.9% White alone, 15.1% Black or African American alone, 10.0% Asian alone, 0.6% American Indian and Alaska Native alone, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone, and 2.3% Two or more races. Hispanic or Latino accounted for 20.9%, while White alone (non-Hispanic or Latino) accounted for 54.6% of the population. Many of the municipalities in Bergen County, New Jersey, the state&#x27;s largest county, have a sizeable minority population of Hispanics and Asians. There are also three state-recognized tribes, and in 2020, 51,186 identified as being Native American alone, while 96,691 did in combination with one or more other races.

New Jersey hosts some of the nation&#x27;s largest communities of religious and ethnic minorities in proportional or absolute terms. It has the second-largest Jewish population by percentage (after New York); the largest Muslim population by percentage; the largest population of Peruvians in the U.S.; the largest population of Cubans outside Florida; the third-highest Asian population by percentage; and the second highest Italian population, according to the 2000 Census. African Americans, Hispanics (Puerto Ricans and Dominicans), West Indians, Arabs, and Brazilian and Portuguese Americans are also high in number. New Jersey also has the fourth-largest Filipino population, and fourth-largest Chinese population, per the 2010 U.S. Census.

New Jersey has the-third highest Indian population of any state by absolute numbers and the highest by percentage, with India Square in Jersey City, Hudson County hosting the highest concentration of Asian Indians in the Western Hemisphere. A study by the Pew Research Center found that in 2013, New Jersey was the only U.S. state in which immigrants born in India constituted the largest foreign-born nationality, representing roughly 10% of all foreign-born residents in the state. Central New Jersey, particularly Edison and surrounding Middlesex County, has the highest concentration of Indians, at nearly 20% in 2020; Little India is the largest and most diverse South Asian cultural hub in the United States. The area includes a sprawling Chinatown and Koreatown running along New Jersey Route 27. Monroe Township in Middlesex County has experienced a particularly rapid growth rate in its Indian American population with an estimated 5,943 (13.6%) as of 2017, which was 23 times the 256 (0.9%) counted at the 2000 Census; Diwali is celebrated by the township as a Hindu holiday. In Middlesex County, election ballots are printed in English, Spanish, Gujarati, Hindi, and Punjabi. Robbinsville, in neighboring Mercer County, hosts the world&#x27;s largest Hindu temple outside Asia. Carteret&#x27;s Punjabi Sikh community, variously estimated at upwards of 3,000, is the largest concentration of Sikhs in the state. Bergen County is home to America&#x27;s largest Malayali community.

New Jersey also has the third-largest Korean population, with Bergen County home to the highest Korean concentration per capita of any U.S. county (6.9% in 2011). It is a growing hub and home to all of the nation&#x27;s top ten municipalities by percentage of Korean population, led by Palisades Park (벼랑 공원), the municipality with the highest density of ethnic Koreans in the Western Hemisphere. Displaying ubiquitous Hangul (한글) signage and known as the &quot;Korean village&quot;, Palisades Park uniquely comprises a Korean majority (52% in 2010) of its population, with both the highest Korean-American density and percentage of any municipality in the United States.

===Birth data===

===Languages===

As of 2010, 71.31% (5,830,812) of New Jersey residents age5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 14.59% (1,193,261) spoke Spanish, 1.23% (100,217) Chinese (which includes Cantonese and Mandarin), 1.06% (86,849) Italian, 1.06% (86,486) Portuguese, 0.96% (78,627) Tagalog, and Korean was spoken as a main language by 0.89% (73,057) of the population over the age of five. In total, 28.69% (2,345,644) of New Jersey&#x27;s population age5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.

A diverse collection of languages has since evolved amongst the state&#x27;s population, given that New Jersey has become cosmopolitan and is home to ethnic enclaves of non-English-speaking communities:

* Albanian – Paterson, Garfield
* Arabic – Bayonne, Paterson, Jersey City
* Armenian – Bergen County
* Bengali – Paterson
* Gujarati and Hindi – Jersey City, all of Middlesex County, Cherry Hill, Parsippany, Princeton

* Yiddish – Lakewood Township, Ocean County, Jackson

===Sexual orientation and gender identity===

New Jersey is widely regarded as an LGBTQ+ friendly state and is now home to more gay villages per square mile than any other U.S. state. Same-sex marriage in New Jersey has been legally recognized since October 21, 2013, the effective date of a trial court ruling invalidating New Jersey&#x27;s restriction of marriage to persons of different sexes at the time. In September 2013, Mary C. Jacobson, Assignment Judge of the Mercer Vicinage of the Superior Court, ruled that as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s June 2013 decision in &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot;, the Constitution of New Jersey requires the state to recognize same-sex marriages.

Numerous gayborhoods have emerged in New Jersey, most prominently in Jersey City, Asbury Park, Maplewood, Montclair, and Lambertville. Trenton, the state capital of New Jersey, elected Reed Gusciora, its first openly gay mayor, in 2018, and Jennifer Williams, New Jersey&#x27;s first openly transgender city councilmember, in 2022. In June 2018, Maplewood, Essex County unveiled permanent rainbow-colored crosswalks to celebrate LGBTQ pride. Rahway, Union County, also unveiled its own rainbow-colored crosswalks in June 2019. In January 2019, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed legislation mandating LGBTQ+ inclusive educational curriculum in schools. In February 2019, New Jersey began allowing a neutral or non-binary gender choice on birth certificates.

===Religion===
By number of adherents, the largest religious traditions in New Jersey, according to the 2010 Association of Religion Data Archives, were the Roman Catholic Church with 3,235,290; Islam with 160,666; and the United Methodist Church with 138,052. The world&#x27;s largest Hindu temple outside Asia is in Robbinsville, Mercer County. In September 2021, the State of New Jersey aligned with the World Hindu Council to declare October Hindu Heritage Month. In January 2018, Gurbir Grewal became the first Sikh American to serve as state attorney general in the United States. In January 2019, Sadaf Jaffer of Montgomery became the first female Muslim American mayor, first female South Asian mayor, and first female Pakistani-American mayor in the U.S. Large numbers of Orthodox Jews are now migrating to New Jersey from New York, due to the latter&#x27;s higher cost of living. The world&#x27;s largest gathering of rabbis outside of Israel occurred in Edison on December 1, 2024.

==Education==

As of the 2020–2021 school year, there were 686 operating districts in the state. Of these, 599 were traditional public school districts and 87 were charter school districts. The NJDOE reported a total district enrollment of 1,362,400 students, the lowest total enrollment since the early 2000s, though these figures do not consider homeschooled students or those attending out-of-state schools. New Jersey public schools emphasize STEM subjects, and New Jersey is home to more scientists and engineers per square mile than anywhere else in the world.

===Educational standards===
New Jersey is known for the high quality of its education. In 2024, New Jersey spent the second-most per public school student among all states, behind New York, amounting to $26,600 spent per pupil; Over 50% of the expenditure is allocated to student instruction.

New Jersey is home to several prestigious private universities, including Princeton University in Princeton in Mercer County, one of the world&#x27;s most prominent research universities, which was ranked first for the ninth consecutive year among all national universities by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in 2024 and ranked first in comparable lists published the same year by &quot;Forbes&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and public universities such as Rutgers University, headquartered in New Brunswick, Middlesex County, the state&#x27;s flagship institution of higher education.

In 2014, New Jersey&#x27;s school systems were ranked at the top of all fifty U.S. states by financial website WalletHub. In 2018, New Jersey&#x27;s overall educational system was ranked second among all states to Massachusetts by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. In 2019, 2020, and 2021, &quot;Education Week&quot; also ranked New Jersey public schools the best of all U.S. states.

In 2016, nine New Jersey-based high schools were ranked among the top 25 in the nation, more than any other state, in &quot;America&#x27;s Top High Schools 2016&quot;, published by &quot;Newsweek.

In November 2023, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed into law legislation eliminating testing for prospective teachers in reading, writing, and math, replacing it with an alternative certification process.

==Economy==
The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that New Jersey&#x27;s gross state product in the third quarter of 2022 was $753 billion.

===Affluence===

New Jersey&#x27;s per capita gross state product routinely ranks among the highest in the nation. In 2020, New Jersey had more millionaires both per capita and per square mile, representing roughly 9.76% of all New Jersey household, than any state in the nation.

The state is ranked second in the nation by the number of places with per capita incomes exceeding the national average with 76.4%. Three of New Jersey&#x27;s counties are among the 20 highest income U.S. counties in the nation as of 2023.

===Fiscal policy===
New Jersey has seven tax brackets that determine state income tax rates, which range from 1.4% (for income below $20,000) to 8.97% (for income above $500,000).

The standard sales tax rate as of January 1, 2018, is 6.625%, applicable to all retail sales unless specifically exempt by law. This rate, which is comparably lower than that of New York City, often attracts numerous shoppers from New York City, often to suburban Paramus, New Jersey, which has five malls, one of which (the Garden State Plaza) has over of retail space. Tax exemptions include most food items for at-home preparation, medications, most clothing, footwear and disposable paper products for use in the home. There are 27 Urban Enterprise Zone statewide, including sections of Paterson, Elizabeth, and Jersey City. In addition to other benefits to encourage employment within the zone, shoppers can take advantage of a reduced 3.3125% sales tax rate (half the rate charged statewide) at eligible merchants.

New Jersey has the highest cumulative tax rate of all 50 states with residents paying a total of $68 billion in state and local taxes annually with a per capita burden of $7,816 at a rate of 12.9% of income. All real property located in the state is subject to property tax unless specifically exempted by statute. New Jersey does not assess an intangible personal property tax or an estate tax, but it does impose an inheritance tax (which is levied only on heirs who are not direct descendants). In 2023, Governor Phil Murphy signed into law a new tax-relief program known as StayNJ that will provide for an annual property-tax cut of 50% for those aged 65 and over with incomes below $500,000; the cut will go into effect in January 2026 and be capped at $6,500, but with this cap rising as indexed to the increase in New Jersey&#x27;s overall property taxes.

===Federal taxation disparity===
New Jersey consistently ranks as having one of the highest proportional levels of disparity of any state in the U.S., based upon what it receives from the federal government relative to what it pays. In 2015, WalletHub ranked New Jersey the state that was least dependent on federal government aid overall and the state with the fourth-lowest return on taxpayer investment from the federal government, at 48 cents per dollar.

New Jersey has one of the highest tax burdens of any state the nation. Factors for this include the large federal tax liability, which is not adjusted for New Jersey&#x27;s higher cost of living and Medicaid funding formulas.

===Industries===
New Jersey&#x27;s economy is multifaceted, featuring high levels of both productivity and retail consumption; the Garden State&#x27;s economy comprises the pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology, information technology, the financial industry, tourism, filmmaking, telecommunications, gambling, food processing, electrical equipment manufacturing, printing, and publishing. New Jersey&#x27;s agricultural outputs are nursery stock, horses, vegetables, fruits and nuts, seafood, and dairy products. New Jersey ranks second among states in blueberry production, third in cranberries and spinach, and fourth in bell peppers, peaches, and head lettuce. The state harvests the fourth-largest number of acres planted with asparagus. South Jersey has become an East Coast epicenter for logistics and warehouse construction.

====Scientific economy====
New Jersey has a strong scientific economy and is home to major pharmaceutical and telecommunications firms, drawing on the state&#x27;s large and well-educated labor pool, including one of the highest concentrations of engineers and other scientists in the world. There is also a robust service economy in retail sales, education, and real estate, serving residents who work in New York City or Philadelphia. Thomas Edison invented the first electric light bulb at his home in Menlo Park, Edison in 1879. New Jersey is also a key participant in the renewable wind industry. New Jersey has more scientists and engineers per square mile than anywhere in the world, and is a global leader in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, life sciences, and technology.

====Corporate and retail====
New Jersey hosts numerous business headquarters, including twenty-four Fortune 500 companies. Paramus in Bergen County has become the top retail ZIP code (07652) in the United States, with the municipality generating over US$6 billion in annual retail sales. Several New Jersey counties, including Somerset (7), Morris (10), Hunterdon (13), Bergen (21), and Monmouth (42), have been ranked among the highest-income counties in the United States.

====Shipping, manufacturing, and logistics====
Shipping is a key industry in New Jersey because of the state&#x27;s strategic geographic location, the Port of New York and New Jersey being the busiest port on the East Coast. The Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal was the world&#x27;s first container port and today is one of the world&#x27;s largest. New Jersey&#x27;s location at the center of the Eastern North American population belt has made the state a prime hub for the logistics, warehousing, and supply chain management industries. The manufacturing economy in New Jersey had declined for several decades in the post-Industrial Revolution era but has since resumed growth.

====Tourism====

New Jersey&#x27;s location at the center of the Northeast megalopolis and its extensive transportation system have put over one-third of all United States residents and many Canadian residents within overnight distance by land. This accessibility to consumer revenue has enabled seaside resorts such as Atlantic City and the remainder of the Jersey Shore, as well as the state&#x27;s other natural and cultural attractions, to contribute significantly to the record 111 million tourist visits to New Jersey in 2018, providing US$44.7 billion in tourism revenue, directly supporting 333,860 jobs, sustaining more than 531,000 jobs overall including peripheral impacts, and generating US$5 billion in state and local tax revenue.

====Gambling====
In 1976, a referendum by Jersey voters approved casino gambling in Atlantic City, where the first legalized casino opened in 1978. At that time, Las Vegas was the only other casino resort in the country. Today, several casinos lie along the Atlantic City Boardwalk, the oldest and longest boardwalk in the world, at in length. Atlantic City experienced a dramatic contraction in its stature as a gambling destination after 2010, including the closure of multiple casinos since 2014, spurred by competition from the advent of legalized gambling in other northeastern U.S. states.

On February 26, 2013, Governor Chris Christie signed online gambling into law. Sports betting has become a growing source of gambling revenue in New Jersey, with sportsbooks bringing in almost $12 billion in bets, making over $1 billion in revenue in 2023. Since being legalized across the nation by the U.S. Supreme Court on May 14, 2018, New Jersey led all states in sports betting handle until New York passed them. In September 2022, the lifetime revenue from online casinos operating in New Jersey for the nine years since the industry&#x27;s launch had surpassed $5 billion.

====Media====
=====Television and film production=====
New Jersey is a growing center for filmmaking and television production, with media companies, enticed by its proximity to Manhattan, in conjunction with tax incentives, collectively spending billions of dollars to develop large new studio facilities and sound stage complexes. Motion picture technology was developed by Thomas Edison, with much of his early work done at his West Orange laboratory. Edison&#x27;s Black Maria was the first motion picture studio. America&#x27;s first motion picture industry started in 1907 in Fort Lee and the first studio was constructed there in 1909. DuMont Laboratories in Passaic developed early sets and made the first broadcast to the private home.

A number of television shows and films have been filmed in New Jersey. Since 1978, the state has maintained a Motion Picture and Television Commission to encourage filming in-state. New Jersey has long offered tax credits to television producers. Governor Chris Christie suspended the credits in 2010, but the New Jersey State Legislature in 2011 approved the restoration and expansion of the tax credit program. Under bills passed by both the state Senate and Assembly, the program offers 20 percent tax credits (22% in urban enterprise zones) to television and film productions that shoot in the state and meet set standards for hiring and local spending. When Governor Phil Murphy took office, he instated the New Jersey Film &amp; Digital Media Tax Credit Program in 2018 and expanded it in 2020. The benefits include a 30% tax credit on film projects and a 40% subsidy for studio developments.

New Jersey has several PBS affiliates: WNET (13) in Newark, WNJN (50) in Montclair, WNJB (58) in New Brunswick, WNJS (23) in Camden and WNJT (52) in Trenton.

There are no standard commercial network affiliates in the state. WMGM-TV (Wildwood) lost its affiliation with NBC in 2014. Viewers in northern New Jersey receive New York City market stations over cable or over the air; southern New Jersey viewers receive Philadelphia market stations over cable or over the air.

WMGM now affiliates with the True Crime Network. WJLP (Middletown) affiliates with the retro network MeTV. There are Telemundo affiliates in Fort Lee, Linden and Mount Laurel, and Univision affiliates in Paterson and Vineland.

====Finance as Wall Street West====

Jersey City&#x27;s Hudson River waterfront, from Exchange Place to Newport, is known as Wall Street West and has over 13 million square feet of Class A office space. One third of the private sector jobs in the city are in the financial services sector: more than 60% are in the securities industry, 20% are in banking and 8% in insurance. Jersey City is home to the headquarters of Verisk Analytics and Lord Abbett, a privately held money management firm. Companies such as Computershare, ADP, IPC Systems, and Fidelity Investments also conduct operations in the city. In 2014, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine moved its headquarters to the district, having been awarded a $27 million tax grant in exchange for bringing 350 jobs to the city over a ten-year period. By the early 2020s, the construction of residential skyscrapers Downtown made median rental rates in Jersey City amongst the highest of any city in the United States.

====Natural resources and energy====

Limited mining activity of zinc, iron, and manganese still takes place in the area in and around the Franklin Furnace in Sussex County.

Although New Jersey is home to many energy-intensive industries, its energy consumption is only 2.7% of the U.S. total, and its carbon dioxide emissions are 0.8% of the U.S. total. New Jersey&#x27;s electricity comes primarily from natural gas and nuclear power. New Jersey is seventh in the nation in solar power installations, enabled by one of the country&#x27;s most favorable net metering policies and renewable portfolio standard. The state has more than 140,000 solar installations.

==Environment==
Due to past industrial activity, New Jersey has more Superfund toxic waste sites than any other state in the union despite its small geographic size. By 2024, only 35 of New Jersey&#x27;s Superfund sites (out of about 150 that have been on the EPA&#x27;s list since the Superfund law was passed in 1980) have been cleaned up.

In late 2023, a concern became public about PFAs (so-called &quot;forever chemicals&quot;) existing in the state&#x27;s water supplies.

==Transportation==

New Jersey&#x27;s population density and location at the geographic center of the Northeast Megalopolis have rendered it a vital transportation for hub for both passengers and industry.

===Roadways===


The New Jersey Turnpike is one of the most prominent and heavily trafficked roadways in the United States. This toll road, which overlaps with Interstate 95 for much of its length, carries traffic between Delaware and New York, and up and down the East Coast in general. Commonly referred to as simply &quot;the Turnpike&quot;, it is known for its numerous rest areas named after prominent New Jerseyans.

The Garden State Parkway, or simply &quot;the Parkway&quot;, carries relatively more in-state traffic than interstate traffic and runs from New Jersey&#x27;s northern border to its southernmost tip at Cape May. It is the main route that connects the New York metropolitan area to the Jersey Shore. With a total of fifteen travel and six shoulder lanes, the Driscoll Bridge on the Parkway, spanning the Raritan River in Middlesex County, is the widest motor vehicle bridge in the world by number of lanes as well as one of the busiest.

New Jersey is connected to New York City via various key bridges and tunnels. The double-decked George Washington Bridge carries the heaviest load of motor vehicle traffic of any bridge in the world, at 102 million vehicles per year, across fourteen lanes. It connects Fort Lee, New Jersey to the Washington Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan, and carries Interstate 95 and U.S. Route 1/9 across the Hudson River. The Lincoln Tunnel connects to Midtown Manhattan carrying New Jersey Route 495, and the Holland Tunnel connects to Lower Manhattan carrying Interstate 78. New Jersey is also connected to Staten Island by three bridges—from north to south, the Bayonne Bridge, the Goethals Bridge, and the Outerbridge Crossing.

New Jersey has interstate compacts with all three of its neighboring states. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Delaware River Port Authority (with Pennsylvania), the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission (with Pennsylvania), and the Delaware River and Bay Authority (with Delaware) operate most of the major transportation routes in and out of the state. Bridge tolls are collected only from traffic exiting the state, with the exception of the private Dingman&#x27;s Ferry Bridge over the Delaware River, which charges a toll in both directions.

It is unlawful for a customer to serve themselves gasoline in New Jersey. It became the last remaining U.S. state where all gas stations are required to sell full-service gasoline to customers at all times in 2016, after Oregon&#x27;s introduction of restricted self-service gasoline availability took effect.

===Airports===

Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) is one of the busiest airports in the United States. Operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, it is one of the three main airports serving the New York metropolitan area, along with John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, which are both in Queens, New York. United Airlines is the airport&#x27;s largest tenant, operating an entire terminal (Terminal C) there, which it uses as one of its primary hubs. FedEx Express operates a large cargo terminal at EWR as well. The adjacent Newark Airport railroad station provides access to Amtrak and NJ Transit trains along the Northeast Corridor Line.

Two smaller commercial airports, Atlantic City International Airport and rapidly growing Trenton-Mercer Airport, also operate in other parts of the state. Teterboro Airport in Bergen County and Millville Municipal Airport in Cumberland County are general aviation airports popular with private and corporate aircraft due to their proximity to New York City and the Jersey Shore, respectively.

===Rail and bus===


NJ Transit operates extensive rail and bus service throughout the state. A state-run corporation, it began with the consolidation of several private bus companies in North Jersey in 1979. In the early 1980s, it acquired Conrail&#x27;s commuter train operations that connected suburban towns to New York City. NJ Transit has 12 rail lines that run through different parts of the state and 165 stations statewide. Most of the lines end at either Penn Station in New York City or Hoboken Terminal in Hoboken, although some lines serve service to both terminal stations. One line provides service between Atlantic City and Philadelphia.

NJ Transit also operates three light rail systems in the state. The Hudson-Bergen Light Rail connects Bayonne to North Bergen, through Hoboken and Jersey City. The Newark Light Rail is partially underground, and connects downtown Newark with other parts of the city and its suburbs, Belleville and Bloomfield. The River Line connects Trenton, and Camden.

The PATH is a rapid transit system consisting of four lines operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. It links Hoboken, Jersey City, Harrison, and Newark with New York City. The PATCO Speedline is a rapid transit system that links Camden County to Philadelphia. Both the PATCO and the PATH are two of only five rapid transit systems in the United States to operate 24 hours a day.

Amtrak operates numerous long-distance passenger trains in New Jersey, both to and from neighboring states and around the country. In addition to the Newark Airport connection, other major Amtrak railway stations include Trenton Transit Center, Metropark, and the historic Newark Penn Station.

The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, or SEPTA, has two commuter rail lines that operate into New Jersey. The Trenton Line terminates at the Trenton Transit Center, and the West Trenton Line terminates at the West Trenton Rail Station in Ewing.

AirTrain Newark is a monorail connecting the Amtrak/NJ Transit station on the Northeast Corridor to the airport&#x27;s terminals and parking lots.

Some private bus carriers still remain in New Jersey. Most of these carriers operate with state funding to offset losses and state owned buses are provided to these carriers, of which Coach USA companies make up the bulk. Other carriers include private charter and tour bus operators that take gamblers from other parts of New Jersey, New York City, Philadelphia, and Delaware to the casino resorts of Atlantic City.

===Ferries===
New York Waterway has ferry terminals at Belford, Jersey City, Hoboken, Weehawken, and Edgewater, with service to different parts of Manhattan. Liberty Water Taxi in Jersey City has ferries from Paulus Hook and Liberty State Park to Battery Park City in Manhattan. Statue Cruises offers service from Liberty State Park to the Statue of Liberty National Monument, including Ellis Island. SeaStreak offers services from the Raritan Bayshore to Manhattan, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, and Nantucket.

The Delaware River and Bay Authority operates the Cape May–Lewes Ferry on Delaware Bay, carrying both passengers and vehicles between New Jersey and Delaware as part of US 9. The agency also operates the Forts Ferry Crossing for passengers across the Delaware River. The Delaware River Port Authority operates the RiverLink Ferry between the Camden waterfront and Penn&#x27;s Landing in Philadelphia.

==Culture==

===General===
New Jersey has continued to play a prominent role as a U.S. cultural nexus. Like every state, New Jersey has its own cuisine, religious communities, museums, and halls of fame.

New Jersey is the birthplace of many modern inventions, including FM radio, the motion picture camera, the lithium battery, the light bulb, transistors, and the electric train. Other New Jersey creations include: the drive-in movie, the cultivated blueberry, cranberry sauce, the boardwalk, the zipper, the phonograph, saltwater taffy, the dirigible, the seedless watermelon, the first use of a submarine in warfare, and the ice cream cone.

Diners are iconic to New Jersey. The state is home to many diner manufacturers and has over 600 diners, more than any other place in the world.

New Jersey is the only state to have never had a state song; as of 2021, it is one of only two states (the other being Maryland) that are currently without a state song. &quot;I&#x27;m From New Jersey&quot; is incorrectly listed on many websites as being the New Jersey state song, but it was not even a contender when the New Jersey Arts Council submitted state song suggestions to the New Jersey Legislature in 1996.

New Jersey is frequently the target of jokes in American culture, especially from New York City-based television shows, such as &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Academic Michael Aaron Rockland attributes this to New Yorkers&#x27; view that New Jersey is the beginning of Middle America. The New Jersey Turnpike, which runs between two major East Coast cities, New York City and Philadelphia, is also cited as a reason, as people who traverse through the state may only see its industrial zones. Reality television shows like &quot;Jersey Shore&quot; and &quot;The Real Housewives of New Jersey&quot; have reinforced stereotypical views of New Jersey culture, but Rockland cited &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and the music of Bruce Springsteen as exporting a more positive image.

The &quot;New&quot; in &quot;New Jersey&quot; is often omitted in casual conversation.

===Cuisine===
New Jersey is known for several foods developed within the region, including Taylor Ham (also known as pork roll), sloppy joe sandwiches, tomato pies, salt water taffy, and Texas wieners. Just as New York City&#x27;s cuisine has an influence on North Jersey, Philadelphia&#x27;s cuisine influences South Jersey.

New Jersey&#x27;s third-largest industry is food and agriculture just behind pharmaceuticals and tourism. New Jersey is one of the top 10 producers of blueberries, cranberries, peaches, tomatoes, bell peppers, eggplant, cucumbers, apples, spinach, squash, and asparagus in the United States. Many restaurants in the state offer locally grown ingredients because of this.

Campbell&#x27;s Soup Company has been headquartered in Camden since 1869. Goya Foods, the largest Hispanic-owned food company in the United States, operates a corporate headquarters in Jersey City. Mars Wrigley Confectionery&#x27;s US headquarters has been based in Hackettstown and Newark since 2007.

Several states with substantial Italian American populations take credit for the development of submarine sandwiches, including New Jersey.

===Music===
New Jersey has long been an important origin for both rock and rap music. Prominent musicians from or with significant connections to New Jersey include:
* Singer Frank Sinatra was born in Hoboken. He sang with a neighborhood vocal group, the Hoboken Four, and appeared in neighborhood theater amateur shows before he became an Academy Award-winning actor.
* Singer Whitney Houston was born in Newark, New Jersey. Houston began singing at New Hope Baptist Church in Newark as a child and became a background vocalist while in high school. She then became the best-selling New Jersey musician ever, having sold over 220 million records worldwide.
* Bruce Springsteen, who has sung of New Jersey life on most of his albums, is from Freehold. Some of his songs that represent New Jersey life are &quot;Born to Run&quot;, &quot;Spirit in the Night&quot;, &quot;Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)&quot;, &quot;Thunder Road&quot;, &quot;Atlantic City&quot;, and &quot;Jungleland&quot;.
* Irvington&#x27;s Queen Latifah was one of the first female rappers to succeed in music, film, and television.
* Southside Johnny, eponymous leader of Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes was raised in Ocean Grove. He is considered the &quot;Grandfather of the New Jersey Sound&quot; and is cited by Jersey-born Jon Bon Jovi as his reason for singing.
* Jon Bon Jovi, from Sayreville, reached fame in the 1980s with hard rock outfit Bon Jovi. The band has also written many songs about life in New Jersey, including &quot;Livin&#x27; On A Prayer&quot;, and named one of their albums after the state.
* Grammy-winning jazz vocalist Sarah Vaughn was born and raised in Newark. After singing in her church&#x27;s choir as a child, she was sneaking into Newark nightclubs to sing and play piano by the time she was a teenager.
* In 1964, the Isley Brothers founded the record label T-Neck Records, named after Teaneck, their home at the time.
* The Broadway musical &quot;Jersey Boys&quot; is based on the lives of the members of the Four Seasons, three of whose members were born in New Jersey (Tommy DeVito, Frankie Valli, and Nick Massi) while a fourth, Bob Gaudio, was born in the Bronx but raised in Bergenfield.

==Sports==

New Jersey currently has six teams from major professional sports leagues playing in the state, although one Major League Soccer team and two National Football League teams identify themselves as being from the New York metropolitan area.

===Professional sports===

The National Hockey League&#x27;s New Jersey Devils, based in Newark at the Prudential Center, is the only major league sports franchise to bear the state&#x27;s name. Founded in 1974 in Kansas City, Missouri, as the Kansas City Scouts, the team played in Denver, Colorado, as the Colorado Rockies from 1976 until the spring of 1982 when naval architect, businessman, and Jersey City native John J. McMullen purchased, renamed, and moved the franchise to Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford&#x27;s Meadowlands Sports Complex. While the team was poor to mediocre in Kansas City, Denver, and its first years in New Jersey, qualifying for the playoffs once in the 13 seasons from 1974 to 1987, the Devils ultimately established themselves in late 1980s and early 1990s during the tenure of Hall of Fame president and general manager Lou Lamoriello. As of 2023, the Devils have appeared in 23 postseasons in 40 seasons in New Jersey, reaching five Stanley Cup Finals (most recently in 2012) and winning it in 1995, 2000, and 2003. The organization is the youngest of the nine &quot;Big Four&quot; major league teams based in New York metropolitan area, ultimately establishing its core following throughout the northern and central portions of the state and carving a place in a media market once dominated by the New York Rangers and Islanders which has the distinction of being the only metropolitan area in the country with three major league professional sports teams participating in the same sport.

In 2018, the Philadelphia Flyers renovated and expanded their training facility, the Virtua Center Flyers Skate Zone, in Voorhees Township in the southern portion of the state.

The New York metropolitan area&#x27;s two National Football League teams, the New York Giants and the New York Jets, play at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford&#x27;s Meadowlands Sports Complex. Built for about $1.6 billion, the venue is one of the most expensive stadiums ever built. On February 2, 2014, MetLife Stadium hosted Super Bowl XLVIII.

The New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer play in Sports Illustrated Stadium, a soccer-specific stadium in Harrison across the Passaic River from downtown Newark. On July 27, 2011, Red Bull Arena hosted the 2011 MLS All-Star Game. New Jersey hosted matches during the 1994 FIFA World Cup at Giants Stadium and will be one of 16 cities to host matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, at MetLife Stadium, which will also host the tournament final.

From 1977 to 2012, New Jersey had a National Basketball Association team, the New Jersey Nets. WNBA&#x27;s New York Liberty played in New Jersey from 2011 to 2013 while their primary home arena, Madison Square Garden was undergoing renovations. In 2016, the Philadelphia 76ers of the NBA opened their new headquarters and training facility, the Philadelphia 76ers Training Complex, in Camden.

The Meadowlands Sports Complex is home to the Meadowlands Racetrack, one of three major harness racing tracks in the state. The Meadowlands Racetrack and Freehold Raceway in Freehold are two of the major harness racing tracks in North America. Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport is a popular spot for thoroughbred racing in New Jersey and the northeast. It hosted the Breeders&#x27; Cup in 2007, and its turf course was renovated in preparation.

===College sports===
====Major schools====
New Jerseyans&#x27; collegiate allegiances are predominantly split among the three major NCAA Division I programs in the state: the Rutgers University (New Jersey&#x27;s flagship state university) Scarlet Knights, members of the Big Ten Conference; the Seton Hall University (the state&#x27;s largest Catholic university) Pirates, members of the Big East Conference; and the Princeton University (the state&#x27;s Ivy League university) Tigers.

The intense rivalry between Rutgers and Princeton athletics began with the first intercollegiate football game in 1869. The schools have not met on the football field since 1980, but they continue to play each other annually in all other sports offered by the two universities.

Rutgers, which fields 24 teams in various sports, is nationally known for its football program, with a 6–4 all-time bowl record; and its women&#x27;s basketball programs, which appeared in a National Final in 2007. In 2008 and 2009, Rutgers expanded their football home, Rutgers Stadium, now called SHI Stadium, on the Busch Campus. The basketball teams play at the Rutgers Athletic Center on Livingston Campus. Both venues and campuses are in Piscataway, across the Raritan River from New Brunswick. The university also fields men&#x27;s basketball and baseball programs. Rutgers&#x27; fans live mostly in the western parts of the state and Middlesex County; its alumni base is the largest in the state.

Rutgers&#x27; satellite campuses in Camden and Newark each field their own athletic programs—the Rutgers–Camden Scarlet Raptors and the Rutgers–Newark Scarlet Raiders—which both compete in NCAA Division III.

Seton Hall fields no football team, but its men&#x27;s basketball team is one of the Big East&#x27;s storied programs. No New Jersey team has won more games in the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament, and it is the state&#x27;s only men&#x27;s basketball program to reach a modern National Final. The Pirates play their home games at Prudential Center in downtown Newark, about from the university&#x27;s South Orange campus. Their fans hail largely from the predominantly Roman Catholic areas of the northern part of the state and the Jersey Shore. The annual inter-conference rivalry game between Seton Hall and Rutgers, whose venue alternates between Newark and Piscataway, the Garden State Hardwood Classic, is planned through 2026.

====Other schools====
The state&#x27;s other Division I schools include the Monmouth University Hawks (West Long Branch), the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) Highlanders (Newark), the Rider University Broncs (Lawrenceville), and the Saint Peter&#x27;s University Peacocks and Peahens (Jersey City).

Fairleigh Dickinson University competes in both Division I and Division III. It has two campuses, each with its own sports teams. The teams at the Metropolitan Campus are known as the FDU Knights, and compete in the Northeast Conference and NCAA Division I. The college at Florham (FDU-Florham) teams are known as the FDU-Florham Devils and compete in the Middle Atlantic Conferences&#x27; Freedom Conference and NCAA Division III.

Among the various Division III schools in the state, the Stevens Institute of Technology Ducks have fielded the longest continuously running collegiate men&#x27;s lacrosse program in the country. 2009 marked the 125th season.

===High school===
New Jersey high schools are divided into divisions under the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA).&#x27;

** Meadowlands Grand Prix

==Government and politics==
===Executive===

The position of Governor of New Jersey is one of the most powerful in the nation. The governor is elected on a ticket with their lieutenant governor as the only statewide elected executive officials in the state; the governor appoints the entire executive cabinet and judges of the Supreme and Superior Courts. Phil Murphy (D) is the governor. The governor&#x27;s mansion is Drumthwacket, located in Princeton, Mercer County.

Before 2010, New Jersey was one of the few states without a lieutenant governor. Republican Kim Guadagno was elected the first lieutenant governor of New Jersey on the Republican ticket with Governor Chris Christie and took office on January 19, 2010. The position was created as the result of a Constitutional amendment to the New Jersey State Constitution passed by the voters in 2005. Previously a gubernatorial vacancy would be filled by the president of the New Jersey State Senate as acting governor, thus directing half of the legislative and all of the executive process.

===Legislative===
The current version of the New Jersey State Constitution was adopted in 1947. It provides for a bicameral New Jersey Legislature, consisting of an upper house Senate of 40 members and a lower house General Assembly of 80 members. Each of the 40 legislative districts elects one state senator and two Assembly members. Assembly members are elected for a two-year term in all odd-numbered years; state senators are elected in years ending in 1, 3, and7 and thus serve either four- or two-year terms.

New Jersey is one of only five states that elects its state officials in odd-numbered years (the others are Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Virginia). New Jersey holds elections for these offices every four years, in the year following each federal Presidential election year.

===Judicial===

The New Jersey Supreme Court consists of a chief justice and six associate justices. All are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the state senate. Justices serve an initial seven-year term, after which they can be reappointed to serve until age 70.

Most of the day-to-day work in the New Jersey courts is carried out in the Municipal Court, where simple traffic tickets, minor criminal offenses, and small civil matters are heard.

More serious criminal and civil cases are handled by the Superior Court for each county. All Superior Court judges are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of a majority of the membership of the state senate. Each judge serves an initial seven-year term and can be reappointed to serve until age 70. New Jersey&#x27;s judiciary is unusual in that it still has separate courts of law and equity, like its neighbor Delaware but unlike most other U.S. states. The New Jersey Superior Court is divided into Law and Chancery Divisions at the trial level; the Law Division hears both criminal cases and civil lawsuits where the plaintiff&#x27;s primary remedy is damages, while the Chancery Division hears family cases, civil suits where the plaintiff&#x27;s primary remedy is equitable relief, and probate trials.

The Superior Court also has an Appellate Division, which functions as the state&#x27;s intermediate appellate court. Superior Court judges are assigned to the Appellate Division by the Chief Justice.

There is also a Tax Court, which is a court of limited jurisdiction. Tax Court judges hear appeals of tax decisions made by County Boards of Taxation. They also hear appeals on decisions made by the director of the Division of Taxation on such matters as state income, sales and business taxes, and homestead rebates. Appeals from Tax Court decisions are heard in the Appellate Division of Superior Court. Tax Court judges are appointed by the governor for initial terms of seven years, and upon reappointment are granted tenure until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 70. There are 12 Tax Court judgeships.

===Counties===
New Jersey is divided into 21 counties; 13 date from the colonial era. New Jersey was completely divided into counties by 1692; the present counties were created by dividing the existing ones; most recently Union County in 1857. New Jersey was formerly the only state in the nation where elected county officials were called freeholders. Elected county officials are now called county commissioners as of bill S855 signed by Governor Murphy on August 8, 2020. The county commissioners govern each county as part of its own Board of Chosen County Commissioners The number of county commissioners in each county is determined by referendum, and must consist of three, five, seven or nine members.

Depending on the county, the executive and legislative functions may be performed by the Board of County Commissioners or split into separate branches of government. In 16 counties, the County Commissioners perform both legislative and executive functions on a commission basis, with each commissioner assigned responsibility for a department or group of departments. In the other five counties (Atlantic, Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Mercer), there is a directly elected County Executive who performs the executive functions while the commissioners retain a legislative and oversight role. In counties without an Executive, a County Administrator (or County Manager) may be hired to perform day-to-day administration of county functions.

===Municipalities===

New Jersey currently has 564 municipalities; the most recent dissolution of a municipality was when Pine Valley merged into Pine Hill on January 1, 2022. Unlike other states, all New Jersey land is part of a municipality. In 2008, Governor Jon Corzine proposed cutting state aid to all towns under 10,000 people, to encourage mergers to reduce administrative costs. In May 2009, the Local Unit Alignment Reorganization and Consolidation Commission began a study of about 40 small communities in South Jersey to decide which ones might be good candidates for consolidation.

====Forms of municipal government====
Starting in the 20th century, largely driven by reform-minded goals, a series of six modern forms of government was implemented. This began with the Walsh Act, enacted in 1911 by the New Jersey Legislature, which provided for a three- or five-member commission elected on a non-partisan basis. This was followed by the 1923 Municipal Manager Law, which offered a non-partisan council, provided for a weak mayor elected by and from the members of the council, and introduced a Council-manager government structure with an appointed manager responsible for the day-to-day administration of municipal affairs.

The Faulkner Act, originally enacted in 1950 and substantially amended in 1981, offers four basic plans: Mayor-Council, Council-Manager, Small Municipality, and Mayor-Council-Administrator. The act provides many choices for communities with a preference for a strong executive and professional management of municipal affairs and offers great flexibility in allowing municipalities to select the characteristics of its government: the number of seats on the council; seats selected at-large, by wards, or through a combination of both; staggered or concurrent terms of office; and a mayor chosen by the council or elected directly by voters. Most large municipalities and a majority of New Jersey&#x27;s residents are governed by municipalities with Faulkner Act charters. Municipalities can also formulate their own unique form of government and operate under a Special Charter with the approval of the New Jersey Legislature.

While municipalities retain their names derived from types of government, they may have changed to one of the modern forms of government, or further in the past to one of the other traditional forms, leading to municipalities with formal names quite baffling to the general public. For example, though there are four municipalities that are officially of the village type, none use the village form of government. Loch Arbour and Ridgefield Park (now with a Walsh Act form), Ridgewood (now with a Faulkner Act Council-Manager charter) and South Orange (now operates under a Special Charter) all migrated to other non-village forms.

===Politics===
====Social attitudes and issues====

Socially, New Jersey is considered one of the more liberal states in the nation. Polls indicate that 60% of the population are self-described as pro-choice, although a majority are opposed to late trimester and intact dilation and extraction and public funding of abortion. As of 2022, all aspects of reproductive choice (including abortion) are protected by law.

In a 2009 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll, a plurality supported same-sex marriage 49% to 43% opposed. On October 18, 2013, the New Jersey Supreme Court rendered a provisional, unanimous (7–0) order authorizing same-sex marriage in the state, pending a legal appeal by Governor Chris Christie, who then withdrew this appeal hours after the inaugural same-sex marriages took place on October 21, 2013.

New Jersey also has some of the most stringent gun control laws in the U.S. These include bans on assault firearms, hollow-nose bullets and slingshots. No gun offense in New Jersey is graded less than a felony. BB guns and black-powder guns are all treated as modern firearms. New Jersey does not recognize out-of-state gun licenses and aggressively enforces its own gun laws.

In 2020, the state&#x27;s voting population passed a public question that amended the state constitution to legalize marijuana and erase past legal convictions for possession. The measure passed by a two-thirds vote. At the time the measure was enacted, about a dozen other U.S. states had also legalized the sale and possession of marijuana. As of 2024, local governments and municipalities are still in the process of regulating marijuana-related businesses within their jurisdictions.

====Elections====

New Jersey is a Democratic stronghold. New Jersey Democrats have majority control of both houses of the New Jersey Legislature (Senate, 24–16, and Assembly, 46–34), 9–3 split of the state&#x27;s twelve seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, and both U.S. Senate seats. There have been recent Republican governors, however: Christine Todd Whitman won election in 1993 and 1997 and Chris Christie in 2009 and 2013.

In federal elections, the state leans heavily towards the Democratic Party, having last voted for a Republican for president in 1988. New Jersey was a crucial swing state in the elections of 1960, 1968, and 1992. The last elected Republican to hold a Senate seat from New Jersey was Clifford P. Case in 1979. Newark Mayor Cory Booker was elected in October 2013 to join Robert Menendez to make New Jersey the first state with concurrently serving black and Latino U.S. senators.

The state&#x27;s Democratic strongholds include Camden County, Essex County (the state&#x27;s most Democratic county—it includes Newark, the state&#x27;s largest city), Hudson County (the second-strongest Democratic county, including Jersey City, the state&#x27;s second-largest city); Mercer County (especially around Trenton and Princeton), Middlesex County, and Union County (including Elizabeth, the state&#x27;s fourth-largest city). Other suburban counties, especially Bergen County and Burlington County, had the majority of votes go to the Democratic Party.

The northwestern and southeastern counties of the state are reliably Republican: Republicans have support along the coast in Ocean County and Cape May County as well as in the mountainous northwestern part of the state, especially in Hunterdon County, Sussex County, and Warren County.

To be eligible to vote in a U.S. election, all New Jerseyans are required to start their residency in the state 30 days prior to an election and register 21 days prior to election day.

====Capital punishment====
On December 17, 2007, Governor Jon Corzine signed into law a bill that would eliminate the death penalty in New Jersey. New Jersey was the first state to pass such legislation since Iowa and West Virginia eliminated executions in 1965. Corzine also signed a bill that would downgrade the Death Row prisoners&#x27; sentences from &quot;Death&quot; to &quot;Life in Prison with No Parole&quot;.

==Points of interest==
===Boardwalks===
Many communities along the Jersey Shore have a boardwalk with various attractions, entertainment, shopping, dining, arcades, water parks, and amusement parks. The Atlantic City boardwalk, opened in 1870, as the world&#x27;s first boardwalk. At long, it is also the world&#x27;s longest and busiest boardwalk.
