In probability theory and statistics, a normal distribution or Gaussian distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable. The general form of its probability density function is
formula_18

The parameter is the mean or expectation of the distribution (and also its median and mode), while the parameter formula_19 is the variance. The standard deviation of the distribution is (sigma). A random variable with a Gaussian distribution is said to be normally distributed, and is called a normal deviate.

Normal distributions are important in statistics and are often used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known. Their importance is partly due to the central limit theorem. It states that, under some conditions, the average of many samples (observations) of a random variable with finite mean and variance is itself a random variable—whose distribution converges to a normal distribution as the number of samples increases. Therefore, physical quantities that are expected to be the sum of many independent processes, such as measurement errors, often have distributions that are nearly normal.

Moreover, Gaussian distributions have some unique properties that are valuable in analytic studies. For instance, any linear combination of a fixed collection of independent normal deviates is a normal deviate. Many results and methods, such as propagation of uncertainty and least squares parameter fitting, can be derived analytically in explicit form when the relevant variables are normally distributed.

A normal distribution is sometimes informally called a bell curve. However, many other distributions are bell-shaped (such as the Cauchy, Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;, and logistic distributions). (For other names, see &quot;Naming&quot;.)

The univariate probability distribution is generalized for vectors in the multivariate normal distribution and for matrices in the matrix normal distribution.

== Definitions ==
=== Standard normal distribution ===
The simplest case of a normal distribution is known as the standard normal distribution or unit normal distribution. This is a special case when formula_20 and formula_21, and it is described by this probability density function (or density):
formula_22
The variable has a mean of 0 and a variance and standard deviation of 1. The density formula_23 has its peak formula_24 at formula_25 and inflection points at formula_26 and .

Although the density above is most commonly known as the &quot;standard normal,&quot; a few authors have used that term to describe other versions of the normal distribution. Carl Friedrich Gauss, for example, once defined the standard normal as
formula_27
which has a variance of , and Stephen Stigler once defined the standard normal as
formula_28
which has a simple functional form and a variance of formula_29

=== General normal distribution ===
Every normal distribution is a version of the standard normal distribution, whose domain has been stretched by a factor (the standard deviation) and then translated by (the mean value):

formula_30

The probability density must be scaled by formula_31 so that the integral is still 1.

If is a standard normal deviate, then formula_32 will have a normal distribution with expected value and standard deviation . This is equivalent to saying that the standard normal distribution can be scaled/stretched by a factor of and shifted by to yield a different normal distribution, called . Conversely, if is a normal deviate with parameters and formula_19, then this distribution can be re-scaled and shifted via the formula formula_34 to convert it to the standard normal distribution. This variate is also called the standardized form of .

=== Notation ===
The probability density of the standard Gaussian distribution (standard normal distribution, with zero mean and unit variance) is often denoted with the Greek letter (phi). The alternative form of the Greek letter phi, , is also used quite often.

The normal distribution is often referred to as formula_35 or . Thus when a random variable is normally distributed with mean and standard deviation , one may write

formula_36

=== Alternative parameterizations ===
Some authors advocate using the precision as the parameter defining the width of the distribution, instead of the standard deviation or the variance . The precision is normally defined as the reciprocal of the variance, . The formula for the distribution then becomes

formula_37

This choice is claimed to have advantages in numerical computations when is very close to zero, and simplifies formulas in some contexts, such as in the Bayesian inference of variables with multivariate normal distribution.

Alternatively, the reciprocal of the standard deviation formula_38 might be defined as the &quot;precision&quot;, in which case the expression of the normal distribution becomes

formula_39

According to Stigler, this formulation is advantageous because of a much simpler and easier-to-remember formula, and simple approximate formulas for the quantiles of the distribution.

Normal distributions form an exponential family with natural parameters formula_40 and formula_41, and natural statistics &quot;x&quot; and &quot;x&quot;2. The dual expectation parameters for normal distribution are and .

=== Cumulative distribution function ===
The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, usually denoted with the capital Greek letter , is the integral

formula_42

=== Error function ===
The related error function formula_43 gives the probability of a random variable, with normal distribution of mean 0 and variance 1/2 falling in the range . That is:

formula_44

These integrals cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions, and are often said to be special functions. However, many numerical approximations are known; see below for more.

The two functions are closely related, namely

formula_45

For a generic normal distribution with density , mean and variance formula_19, the cumulative distribution function is

formula_47

The complement of the standard normal cumulative distribution function, formula_48, is often called the Q-function, especially in engineering texts. It gives the probability that the value of a standard normal random variable will exceed : . Other definitions of the -function, all of which are simple transformations of , are also used occasionally.

The graph of the standard normal cumulative distribution function has 2-fold rotational symmetry around the point (0,1/2); that is, . Its antiderivative (indefinite integral) can be expressed as follows:
formula_49

The cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution can be expanded by integration by parts into a series:

formula_50

where formula_51 denotes the double factorial.

An asymptotic expansion of the cumulative distribution function for large &quot;x&quot; can also be derived using integration by parts. For more, see .

A quick approximation to the standard normal distribution&#x27;s cumulative distribution function can be found by using a Taylor series approximation:

formula_52

==== Recursive computation with Taylor series expansion ====
The recursive nature of the formula_53family of derivatives may be used to easily construct a rapidly converging Taylor series expansion using recursive entries about any point of known value of the distribution,formula_54:

formula_55

where:

formula_56

==== Using the Taylor series and Newton&#x27;s method for the inverse function ====
An application for the above Taylor series expansion is to use Newton&#x27;s method to reverse the computation. That is, if we have a value for the cumulative distribution function, formula_57, but do not know the x needed to obtain the formula_57, we can use Newton&#x27;s method to find x, and use the Taylor series expansion above to minimize the number of computations. Newton&#x27;s method is ideal to solve this problem because the first derivative of formula_57, which is an integral of the normal standard distribution, is the normal standard distribution, and is readily available to use in the Newton&#x27;s method solution.

To solve, select a known approximate solution, formula_60, to the desired . formula_60 may be a value from a distribution table, or an intelligent estimate followed by a computation of formula_54 using any desired means to compute. Use this value of formula_60 and the Taylor series expansion above to minimize computations.

Repeat the following process until the difference between the computed formula_64 and the desired , which we will call formula_65, is below a chosen acceptably small error, such as 10−5, 10−15, etc.:

formula_66

where

: formula_67 is the formula_57 from a Taylor series solution using formula_60 and formula_54

formula_71

When the repeated computations converge to an error below the chosen acceptably small value, &quot;x&quot; will be the value needed to obtain a formula_57 of the desired value, .

==== Standard deviation and coverage ====
About 68% of values drawn from a normal distribution are within one standard deviation &quot;σ&quot; from the mean; about 95% of the values lie within two standard deviations; and about 99.7% are within three standard deviations. This fact is known as the 68–95–99.7 (empirical) rule, or the &quot;3-sigma rule&quot;.

More precisely, the probability that a normal deviate lies in the range between formula_73 and formula_74 is given by
formula_75
To 12 significant digits, the values for formula_76 are:

For large , one can use the approximation formula_77.

==== Quantile function ====
The quantile function of a distribution is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function. The quantile function of the standard normal distribution is called the probit function, and can be expressed in terms of the inverse error function:
formula_78
For a normal random variable with mean and variance formula_19, the quantile function is
formula_80
The quantile formula_81 of the standard normal distribution is commonly denoted as . These values are used in hypothesis testing, construction of confidence intervals and Q–Q plots. A normal random variable will exceed formula_82 with probability formula_83, and will lie outside the interval formula_84 with probability . In particular, the quantile formula_85 is 1.96; therefore a normal random variable will lie outside the interval formula_86 in only 5% of cases.

The following table gives the quantile formula_87 such that will lie in the range formula_84 with a specified probability . These values are useful to determine tolerance interval for sample averages and other statistical estimators with normal (or asymptotically normal) distributions. The following table shows formula_89, not formula_81 as defined above.

For small , the quantile function has the useful asymptotic expansion
formula_91

== Properties ==
The normal distribution is the only distribution whose cumulants beyond the first two (i.e., other than the mean and variance) are zero. It is also the continuous distribution with the maximum entropy for a specified mean and variance. Geary has shown, assuming that the mean and variance are finite, that the normal distribution is the only distribution where the mean and variance calculated from a set of independent draws are independent of each other.

The normal distribution is a subclass of the elliptical distributions. The normal distribution is symmetric about its mean, and is non-zero over the entire real line. As such it may not be a suitable model for variables that are inherently positive or strongly skewed, such as the weight of a person or the price of a share. Such variables may be better described by other distributions, such as the log-normal distribution or the Pareto distribution.

The value of the normal density is practically zero when the value lies more than a few standard deviations away from the mean (e.g., a spread of three standard deviations covers all but 0.27% of the total distribution). Therefore, it may not be an appropriate model when one expects a significant fraction of outliers—values that lie many standard deviations away from the mean—and least squares and other statistical inference methods that are optimal for normally distributed variables often become highly unreliable when applied to such data. In those cases, a more heavy-tailed distribution should be assumed and the appropriate robust statistical inference methods applied.

The Gaussian distribution belongs to the family of stable distributions which are the attractors of sums of independent, identically distributed distributions whether or not the mean or variance is finite. Except for the Gaussian which is a limiting case, all stable distributions have heavy tails and infinite variance. It is one of the few distributions that are stable and that have probability density functions that can be expressed analytically, the others being the Cauchy distribution and the Lévy distribution.

=== Symmetries and derivatives ===
The normal distribution with density formula_92 (mean and variance formula_93) has the following properties:
* It is symmetric around the point formula_94 which is at the same time the mode, the median and the mean of the distribution.
* It is unimodal: its first derivative is positive for formula_95 negative for formula_96 and zero only at formula_97
* The area bounded by the curve and the -axis is unity (i.e. equal to one).
* Its first derivative is formula_98
* Its second derivative is formula_99
* Its density has two inflection points (where the second derivative of is zero and changes sign), located one standard deviation away from the mean, namely at formula_100 and formula_101
* Its density is log-concave.
* Its density is infinitely differentiable, indeed supersmooth of order 2.

Furthermore, the density of the standard normal distribution (i.e. formula_20 and formula_103) also has the following properties:
* Its first derivative is formula_104
* Its second derivative is formula_105
* More generally, its th derivative is formula_106 where formula_107 is the th (probabilist) Hermite polynomial.
* The probability that a normally distributed variable with known and formula_19 is in a particular set, can be calculated by using the fact that the fraction formula_109 has a standard normal distribution.

=== Moments ===

The plain and absolute moments of a variable are the expected values of formula_110 and formula_111, respectively. If the expected value of is zero, these parameters are called &quot;central moments;&quot; otherwise, these parameters are called &quot;non-central moments.&quot; Usually we are interested only in moments with integer order .

If has a normal distribution, the non-central moments exist and are finite for any whose real part is greater than −1. For any non-negative integer , the plain central moments are:
formula_112
Here formula_113 denotes the double factorial, that is, the product of all numbers from to 1 that have the same parity as formula_114

The central absolute moments coincide with plain moments for all even orders, but are nonzero for odd orders. For any non-negative integer formula_115

formula_116
The last formula is valid also for any non-integer formula_117 When the mean formula_118 the plain and absolute moments can be expressed in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions formula_119 and formula_120

formula_121

These expressions remain valid even if is not an integer. See also generalized Hermite polynomials.
The expectation of conditioned on the event that lies in an interval formula_122 is given by
formula_123 this is known as the inverse Mills ratio. Note that above, density of is used instead of standard normal density as in inverse Mills ratio, so here we have formula_19 instead of .

=== Fourier transform and characteristic function ===
The Fourier transform of a normal density with mean and variance formula_19 is

formula_126

where is the imaginary unit. If the mean formula_20, the first factor is 1, and the Fourier transform is, apart from a constant factor, a normal density on the frequency domain, with mean 0 and variance . In particular, the standard normal distribution is an eigenfunction of the Fourier transform.

In probability theory, the Fourier transform of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable is closely connected to the characteristic function formula_128 of that variable, which is defined as the expected value of formula_129, as a function of the real variable (the frequency parameter of the Fourier transform). This definition can be analytically extended to a complex-value variable . The relation between both is:
formula_130

=== Moment- and cumulant-generating functions ===
The moment generating function of a real random variable is the expected value of formula_131, as a function of the real parameter . For a normal distribution with density , mean and variance formula_19, the moment generating function exists and is equal to

formula_133
For any , the coefficient of in the moment generating function (expressed as an exponential power series in ) is the normal distribution&#x27;s expected value .

The cumulant generating function is the logarithm of the moment generating function, namely

formula_134

The coefficients of this exponential power series define the cumulants, but because this is a quadratic polynomial in , only the first two cumulants are nonzero, namely the mean  and the variance .

Some authors prefer to instead work with the characteristic function and .

=== Stein operator and class ===
Within Stein&#x27;s method the Stein operator and class of a random variable formula_135 are formula_136 and formula_137 the class of all absolutely continuous functions formula_138.

=== Zero-variance limit ===
In the limit when formula_19 tends to zero, the probability density formula_92 eventually tends to zero at any formula_141, but grows without limit if formula_142, while its integral remains equal to 1. Therefore, the normal distribution cannot be defined as an ordinary function when .

However, one can define the normal distribution with zero variance as a generalized function; specifically, as a Dirac delta function translated by the mean , that is formula_143
Its cumulative distribution function is then the Heaviside step function translated by the mean , namely
formula_144

=== Maximum entropy ===
Of all probability distributions over the reals with a specified finite mean and finite variance formula_19, the normal distribution formula_35 is the one with maximum entropy. To see this, let be a continuous random variable with probability density . The entropy of is defined as
formula_147

where formula_148 is understood to be zero whenever . This functional can be maximized, subject to the constraints that the distribution is properly normalized and has a specified mean and variance, by using variational calculus. A function with three Lagrange multipliers is defined:

formula_149

At maximum entropy, a small variation formula_150 about formula_92 will produce a variation formula_152 about which is equal to 0:

formula_153

Since this must hold for any small formula_150, the factor multiplying formula_150 must be zero, and solving for formula_92 yields:

formula_157

The Lagrange constraints that formula_92 is properly normalized and has the specified mean and variance are satisfied if and only if formula_159, formula_160, and formula_161 are chosen so that
formula_162
The entropy of a normal distribution formula_163 is equal to
formula_164
which is independent of the mean .

=== Other properties ===
 \exp\left(-\frac{1}{4}\frac{(\mu_1-\mu_2)^2}{\sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
| 4 = The Fisher information matrix for a normal distribution w.r.t. and formula_19 is diagonal and takes the form formula_166
| 5 = The conjugate prior of the mean of a normal distribution is another normal distribution. Specifically, if formula_167 are iid formula_168 and the prior is formula_169, then the posterior distribution for the estimator of will be formula_170
| 6 = The family of normal distributions not only forms an exponential family (EF), but in fact forms a natural exponential family (NEF) with quadratic variance function (NEF-QVF). Many properties of normal distributions generalize to properties of NEF-QVF distributions, NEF distributions, or EF distributions generally. NEF-QVF distributions comprises 6 families, including Poisson, Gamma, binomial, and negative binomial distributions, while many of the common families studied in probability and statistics are NEF or EF.
| 7 = In information geometry, the family of normal distributions forms a statistical manifold with constant curvature . The same family is flat with respect to the (±1)-connections formula_171 and formula_172.
| 8 = If formula_173 are distributed according to formula_174, then formula_175. Note that there is no assumption of independence.

=== Central limit theorem ===


The central limit theorem states that under certain (fairly common) conditions, the sum of many random variables will have an approximately normal distribution. More specifically, where formula_176 are independent and identically distributed random variables with the same arbitrary distribution, zero mean, and variance formula_19 and is their
mean scaled by formula_178
formula_179
Then, as increases, the probability distribution of will tend to the normal distribution with zero mean and variance .

The theorem can be extended to variables formula_180 that are not independent and/or not identically distributed if certain constraints are placed on the degree of dependence and the moments of the distributions.

Many test statistics, scores, and estimators encountered in practice contain sums of certain random variables in them, and even more estimators can be represented as sums of random variables through the use of influence functions. The central limit theorem implies that those statistical parameters will have asymptotically normal distributions.

The central limit theorem also implies that certain distributions can be approximated by the normal distribution, for example:
* The binomial distribution formula_181 is approximately normal with mean formula_182 and variance formula_183 for large and for not too close to 0 or 1.
* The Poisson distribution with parameter is approximately normal with mean and variance , for large values of .
* The chi-squared distribution formula_184 is approximately normal with mean and variance formula_185, for large .
* The Student&#x27;s t-distribution formula_186 is approximately normal with mean 0 and variance 1 when is large.

Whether these approximations are sufficiently accurate depends on the purpose for which they are needed, and the rate of convergence to the normal distribution. It is typically the case that such approximations are less accurate in the tails of the distribution.

A general upper bound for the approximation error in the central limit theorem is given by the Berry–Esseen theorem, improvements of the approximation are given by the Edgeworth expansions.

This theorem can also be used to justify modeling the sum of many uniform noise sources as Gaussian noise. See AWGN.

=== Operations and functions of normal variables ===

The probability density, cumulative distribution, and inverse cumulative distribution of any function of one or more independent or correlated normal variables can be computed with the numerical method of ray-tracing (Matlab code). In the following sections we look at some special cases.

==== Operations on a single normal variable ====
If is distributed normally with mean and variance formula_19, then
* formula_188, for any real numbers and , is also normally distributed, with mean formula_189 and variance formula_190. That is, the family of normal distributions is closed under linear transformations.
* The exponential of is distributed log-normally: formula_191.
* The standard sigmoid of is logit-normally distributed: formula_192.
* The absolute value of has folded normal distribution: formula_193. If formula_194 this is known as the half-normal distribution.
* The absolute value of normalized residuals, formula_195, has chi distribution with one degree of freedom: formula_196.
* The square of formula_197 has the noncentral chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom: formula_198. If formula_194, the distribution is called simply chi-squared.
* The log-likelihood of a normal variable is simply the log of its probability density function: formula_200 Since this is a scaled and shifted square of a standard normal variable, it is distributed as a scaled and shifted chi-squared variable.
* The distribution of the variable restricted to an interval formula_201 is called the truncated normal distribution.
* formula_202 has a Lévy distribution with location 0 and scale formula_203.

===== Operations on two independent normal variables =====
* If formula_204 and formula_205 are two independent normal random variables, with means formula_206, formula_207 and variances formula_208, formula_209, then their sum formula_210 will also be normally distributed,[proof] with mean formula_211 and variance formula_212.
* In particular, if and are independent normal deviates with zero mean and variance formula_19, then formula_214 and formula_215 are also independent and normally distributed, with zero mean and variance formula_216. This is a special case of the polarization identity.
* If formula_204, formula_205 are two independent normal deviates with mean and variance formula_19, and , are arbitrary real numbers, then the variable formula_220 is also normally distributed with mean and variance formula_19. It follows that the normal distribution is stable (with exponent formula_222).
* If formula_223, formula_224 are normal distributions, then their normalized geometric mean formula_225 is a normal distribution formula_226 with formula_227 and formula_228 (see here for a visualization).

===== Operations on two independent standard normal variables =====
If formula_204 and formula_205 are two independent standard normal random variables with mean 0 and variance 1, then
* Their sum and difference is distributed normally with mean zero and variance two: formula_231.
* Their product formula_232 follows the product distribution with density function formula_233 where formula_234 is the modified Bessel function of the second kind. This distribution is symmetric around zero, unbounded at formula_235, and has the characteristic function formula_236.
* Their ratio follows the standard Cauchy distribution: formula_237.
* Their Euclidean norm formula_238 has the Rayleigh distribution.

==== Operations on multiple independent normal variables ====
* Any linear combination of independent normal deviates is a normal deviate.
* If formula_239 are independent standard normal random variables, then the sum of their squares has the chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom formula_240
* If formula_239 are independent normally distributed random variables with means and variances formula_19, then their sample mean is independent from the sample standard deviation, which can be demonstrated using Basu&#x27;s theorem or Cochran&#x27;s theorem. The ratio of these two quantities will have the Student&#x27;s t-distribution with formula_243 degrees of freedom: formula_244
* If formula_239, formula_246 are independent standard normal random variables, then the ratio of their normalized sums of squares will have the F-distribution with degrees of freedom: formula_247

==== Operations on multiple correlated normal variables ====
* A quadratic form of a normal vector, i.e. a quadratic function formula_248 of multiple independent or correlated normal variables, is a generalized chi-square variable.

=== Operations on the density function ===
The split normal distribution is most directly defined in terms of joining scaled sections of the density functions of different normal distributions and rescaling the density to integrate to one. The truncated normal distribution results from rescaling a section of a single density function.

=== Infinite divisibility and Cramér&#x27;s theorem ===
For any positive integer formula_249, any normal distribution with mean and variance formula_19 is the distribution of the sum of formula_249 independent normal deviates, each with mean formula_252 and variance formula_253. This property is called infinite divisibility.

Conversely, if formula_204 and formula_205 are independent random variables and their sum formula_256 has a normal distribution, then both formula_204 and formula_205 must be normal deviates.

This result is known as Cramér&#x27;s decomposition theorem, and is equivalent to saying that the convolution of two distributions is normal if and only if both are normal. Cramér&#x27;s theorem implies that a linear combination of independent non-Gaussian variables will never have an exactly normal distribution, although it may approach it arbitrarily closely.

=== The Kac–Bernstein theorem ===
The Kac–Bernstein theorem states that if formula_259 and are independent and formula_214 and formula_215 are also independent, then both &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; must necessarily have normal distributions.

More generally, if formula_262 are independent random variables, then two distinct linear combinations formula_263 and formula_264will be independent if and only if all formula_265 are normal and formula_266, where formula_267 denotes the variance of formula_265.

=== Extensions ===
The notion of normal distribution, being one of the most important distributions in probability theory, has been extended far beyond the standard framework of the univariate (that is one-dimensional) case (Case 1). All these extensions are also called &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;Gaussian&quot; laws, so a certain ambiguity in names exists.
* The multivariate normal distribution describes the Gaussian law in the &quot;k&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space. A vector is multivariate-normally distributed if any linear combination of its components has a (univariate) normal distribution. The variance of &quot;X&quot; is a &quot;k×k&quot; symmetric positive-definite matrix &quot;V&quot;. The multivariate normal distribution is a special case of the elliptical distributions. As such, its iso-density loci in the &quot;k&quot; = 2 case are ellipses and in the case of arbitrary &quot;k&quot; are ellipsoids.
* Rectified Gaussian distribution a rectified version of normal distribution with all the negative elements reset to 0
* Complex normal distribution deals with the complex normal vectors. A complex vector is said to be normal if both its real and imaginary components jointly possess a 2&quot;k&quot;-dimensional multivariate normal distribution. The variance-covariance structure of &quot;X&quot; is described by two matrices: the &quot;variance&quot; matrix Γ, and the &quot;relation&quot; matrix &quot;C&quot;.
* Matrix normal distribution describes the case of normally distributed matrices.
* Gaussian processes are the normally distributed stochastic processes. These can be viewed as elements of some infinite-dimensional Hilbert space &quot;H&quot;, and thus are the analogues of multivariate normal vectors for the case . A random element is said to be normal if for any constant the scalar product has a (univariate) normal distribution. The variance structure of such Gaussian random element can be described in terms of the linear &quot;covariance &quot;. Several Gaussian processes became popular enough to have their own names:
** Brownian motion,
** Brownian bridge,
** Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process.
* Gaussian q-distribution is an abstract mathematical construction that represents a q-analogue of the normal distribution.
* the q-Gaussian is an analogue of the Gaussian distribution, in the sense that it maximises the Tsallis entropy, and is one type of Tsallis distribution. This distribution is different from the Gaussian q-distribution above.
* The Kaniadakis &quot;κ&quot;-Gaussian distribution is a generalization of the Gaussian distribution which arises from the Kaniadakis statistics, being one of the Kaniadakis distributions.

A random variable &quot;X&quot; has a two-piece normal distribution if it has a distribution

formula_269
formula_270

where &quot;μ&quot; is the mean and &quot;σ&quot;12 and &quot;σ&quot;22 are the variances of the distribution to the left and right of the mean respectively.

The mean, variance and third central moment of this distribution have been determined

formula_271
formula_272
formula_273

where E(&quot;X&quot;), V(&quot;X&quot;) and T(&quot;X&quot;) are the mean, variance, and third central moment respectively.

One of the main practical uses of the Gaussian law is to model the empirical distributions of many different random variables encountered in practice. In such case a possible extension would be a richer family of distributions, having more than two parameters and therefore being able to fit the empirical distribution more accurately. The examples of such extensions are:
* Pearson distribution — a four-parameter family of probability distributions that extend the normal law to include different skewness and kurtosis values.
* The generalized normal distribution, also known as the exponential power distribution, allows for distribution tails with thicker or thinner asymptotic behaviors.

== Statistical inference ==
=== Estimation of parameters ===
It is often the case that we do not know the parameters of the normal distribution, but instead want to estimate them. That is, having a sample formula_274 from a normal formula_275 population we would like to learn the approximate values of parameters and formula_19. The standard approach to this problem is the maximum likelihood method, which requires maximization of the &quot;log-likelihood function&quot;:
formula_277
Taking derivatives with respect to and formula_19 and solving the resulting system of first order conditions yields the &quot;maximum likelihood estimates&quot;:
formula_279

Then formula_280 is as follows:

formula_281

==== Sample mean ====
Estimator formula_282 is called the &quot;sample mean&quot;, since it is the arithmetic mean of all observations. The statistic formula_283 is complete and sufficient for , and therefore by the Lehmann–Scheffé theorem, formula_282 is the uniformly minimum variance unbiased (UMVU) estimator. In finite samples it is distributed normally:
formula_285
The variance of this estimator is equal to the &quot;μμ&quot;-element of the inverse Fisher information matrix formula_286. This implies that the estimator is finite-sample efficient. Of practical importance is the fact that the standard error of formula_282 is proportional to formula_288, that is, if one wishes to decrease the standard error by a factor of 10, one must increase the number of points in the sample by a factor of 100. This fact is widely used in determining sample sizes for opinion polls and the number of trials in Monte Carlo simulations.

From the standpoint of the asymptotic theory, formula_282 is consistent, that is, it converges in probability to as formula_290. The estimator is also asymptotically normal, which is a simple corollary of the fact that it is normal in finite samples:
formula_291

==== Sample variance ====
The estimator formula_292 is called the &quot;sample variance&quot;, since it is the variance of the sample (formula_274). In practice, another estimator is often used instead of the formula_292. This other estimator is denoted formula_295, and is also called the &quot;sample variance&quot;, which represents a certain ambiguity in terminology; its square root is called the &quot;sample standard deviation&quot;. The estimator formula_295 differs from formula_292 by having instead of &quot;n&quot; in the denominator (the so-called Bessel&#x27;s correction):
formula_298
The difference between formula_295 and formula_292 becomes negligibly small for large &quot;n&quot;″s. In finite samples however, the motivation behind the use of formula_295 is that it is an unbiased estimator of the underlying parameter formula_19, whereas formula_292 is biased. Also, by the Lehmann–Scheffé theorem the estimator formula_295 is uniformly minimum variance unbiased (UMVU), which makes it the &quot;best&quot; estimator among all unbiased ones. However it can be shown that the biased estimator formula_292 is better than the formula_295 in terms of the mean squared error (MSE) criterion. In finite samples both formula_295 and formula_292 have scaled chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom:
formula_309
The first of these expressions shows that the variance of formula_295 is equal to formula_311, which is slightly greater than the &quot;σσ&quot;-element of the inverse Fisher information matrix formula_286. Thus, formula_295 is not an efficient estimator for formula_19, and moreover, since formula_295 is UMVU, we can conclude that the finite-sample efficient estimator for formula_19 does not exist.

Applying the asymptotic theory, both estimators formula_295 and formula_292 are consistent, that is they converge in probability to formula_19 as the sample size formula_290. The two estimators are also both asymptotically normal:
formula_321
In particular, both estimators are asymptotically efficient for formula_19.

=== Confidence intervals ===
By Cochran&#x27;s theorem, for normal distributions the sample mean formula_282 and the sample variance &quot;s&quot;2 are independent, which means there can be no gain in considering their joint distribution. There is also a converse theorem: if in a sample the sample mean and sample variance are independent, then the sample must have come from the normal distribution. The independence between formula_282 and &quot;s&quot; can be employed to construct the so-called &quot;t-statistic&quot;:
formula_325
This quantity &quot;t&quot; has the Student&#x27;s t-distribution with degrees of freedom, and it is an ancillary statistic (independent of the value of the parameters). Inverting the distribution of this &quot;t&quot;-statistics will allow us to construct the confidence interval for &quot;μ&quot;; similarly, inverting the &quot;χ&quot;2 distribution of the statistic &quot;s&quot;2 will give us the confidence interval for &quot;σ&quot;2:
formula_326
formula_327
where &quot;tk,p&quot; and are the &quot;p&quot;th quantiles of the &quot;t&quot;- and &quot;χ&quot;2-distributions respectively. These confidence intervals are of the &quot;confidence level&quot; , meaning that the true values &quot;μ&quot; and &quot;σ&quot;2 fall outside of these intervals with probability (or significance level) &quot;α&quot;. In practice people usually take , resulting in the 95% confidence intervals. The confidence interval for &quot;σ&quot; can be found by taking the square root of the interval bounds for &quot;σ&quot;2.

Approximate formulas can be derived from the asymptotic distributions of formula_282 and &quot;s&quot;2:
formula_329
formula_330
The approximate formulas become valid for large values of &quot;n&quot;, and are more convenient for the manual calculation since the standard normal quantiles &quot;z&quot;&quot;α&quot;/2 do not depend on &quot;n&quot;. In particular, the most popular value of , results in .

=== Normality tests ===
Normality tests assess the likelihood that the given data set {&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;xn&quot;} comes from a normal distribution. Typically the null hypothesis &quot;H&quot;0 is that the observations are distributed normally with unspecified mean &quot;μ&quot; and variance &quot;σ&quot;2, versus the alternative &quot;Ha&quot; that the distribution is arbitrary. Many tests (over 40) have been devised for this problem. The more prominent of them are outlined below:

Diagnostic plots are more intuitively appealing but subjective at the same time, as they rely on informal human judgement to accept or reject the null hypothesis.
* Q–Q plot, also known as normal probability plot or rankit plot—is a plot of the sorted values from the data set against the expected values of the corresponding quantiles from the standard normal distribution. That is, it is a plot of point of the form (Φ−1(&quot;pk&quot;), &quot;x&quot;(&quot;k&quot;)), where plotting points &quot;pk&quot; are equal to &quot;pk&quot; = (&quot;k&quot; − &quot;α&quot;)/(&quot;n&quot; + 1 − 2&quot;α&quot;) and &quot;α&quot; is an adjustment constant, which can be anything between 0 and 1. If the null hypothesis is true, the plotted points should approximately lie on a straight line.
* P–P plot – similar to the Q–Q plot, but used much less frequently. This method consists of plotting the points (Φ(&quot;z&quot;(&quot;k&quot;)), &quot;pk&quot;), where formula_331. For normally distributed data this plot should lie on a 45° line between (0, 0) and (1, 1).
Goodness-of-fit tests:

&quot;Moment-based tests&quot;:
* D&#x27;Agostino&#x27;s K-squared test
* Jarque–Bera test
* Shapiro–Wilk test: This is based on the fact that the line in the Q–Q plot has the slope of &quot;σ&quot;. The test compares the least squares estimate of that slope with the value of the sample variance, and rejects the null hypothesis if these two quantities differ significantly.
&quot;Tests based on the empirical distribution function&quot;:
* Anderson–Darling test
* Lilliefors test (an adaptation of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test)

=== Bayesian analysis of the normal distribution ===
Bayesian analysis of normally distributed data is complicated by the many different possibilities that may be considered:
* Either the mean, or the variance, or neither, may be considered a fixed quantity.
* When the variance is unknown, analysis may be done directly in terms of the variance, or in terms of the precision, the reciprocal of the variance. The reason for expressing the formulas in terms of precision is that the analysis of most cases is simplified.
* Both univariate and multivariate cases need to be considered.
* Either conjugate or improper prior distributions may be placed on the unknown variables.
* An additional set of cases occurs in Bayesian linear regression, where in the basic model the data is assumed to be normally distributed, and normal priors are placed on the regression coefficients. The resulting analysis is similar to the basic cases of independent identically distributed data.

The formulas for the non-linear-regression cases are summarized in the conjugate prior article.

==== Sum of two quadratics ====

===== Scalar form =====
The following auxiliary formula is useful for simplifying the posterior update equations, which otherwise become fairly tedious.

formula_332

This equation rewrites the sum of two quadratics in &quot;x&quot; by expanding the squares, grouping the terms in &quot;x&quot;, and completing the square. Note the following about the complex constant factors attached to some of the terms:
# The factor formula_333 has the form of a weighted average of &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot;.
# formula_334 This shows that this factor can be thought of as resulting from a situation where the reciprocals of quantities &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; add directly, so to combine &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; themselves, it is necessary to reciprocate, add, and reciprocate the result again to get back into the original units. This is exactly the sort of operation performed by the harmonic mean, so it is not surprising that formula_335 is one-half the harmonic mean of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.

===== Vector form =====
A similar formula can be written for the sum of two vector quadratics: If x, y, z are vectors of length &quot;k&quot;, and A and B are symmetric, invertible matrices of size formula_336, then

formula_337

where

formula_338

The form x′ A x is called a quadratic form and is a scalar:
formula_339
In other words, it sums up all possible combinations of products of pairs of elements from x, with a separate coefficient for each. In addition, since formula_340, only the sum formula_341 matters for any off-diagonal elements of A, and there is no loss of generality in assuming that A is symmetric. Furthermore, if A is symmetric, then the form formula_342

==== Sum of differences from the mean ====
Another useful formula is as follows:
formula_343
where formula_344

=== With known variance ===
For a set of i.i.d. normally distributed data points X of size &quot;n&quot; where each individual point &quot;x&quot; follows formula_345 with known variance σ2, the conjugate prior distribution is also normally distributed.

This can be shown more easily by rewriting the variance as the precision, i.e. using τ = 1/σ2. Then if formula_346 and formula_347 we proceed as follows.

First, the likelihood function is (using the formula above for the sum of differences from the mean):

formula_348

Then, we proceed as follows:

formula_349

In the above derivation, we used the formula above for the sum of two quadratics and eliminated all constant factors not involving &quot;μ&quot;. The result is the kernel of a normal distribution, with mean formula_350 and precision formula_351, i.e.

formula_352

This can be written as a set of Bayesian update equations for the posterior parameters in terms of the prior parameters:

formula_353

That is, to combine &quot;n&quot; data points with total precision of &quot;nτ&quot; (or equivalently, total variance of &quot;n&quot;/&quot;σ&quot;2) and mean of values formula_354, derive a new total precision simply by adding the total precision of the data to the prior total precision, and form a new mean through a &quot;precision-weighted average&quot;, i.e. a weighted average of the data mean and the prior mean, each weighted by the associated total precision. This makes logical sense if the precision is thought of as indicating the certainty of the observations: In the distribution of the posterior mean, each of the input components is weighted by its certainty, and the certainty of this distribution is the sum of the individual certainties. (For the intuition of this, compare the expression &quot;the whole is (or is not) greater than the sum of its parts&quot;. In addition, consider that the knowledge of the posterior comes from a combination of the knowledge of the prior and likelihood, so it makes sense that we are more certain of it than of either of its components.)

The above formula reveals why it is more convenient to do Bayesian analysis of conjugate priors for the normal distribution in terms of the precision. The posterior precision is simply the sum of the prior and likelihood precisions, and the posterior mean is computed through a precision-weighted average, as described above. The same formulas can be written in terms of variance by reciprocating all the precisions, yielding the more ugly formulas

formula_355

==== With known mean ====
For a set of i.i.d. normally distributed data points X of size &quot;n&quot; where each individual point &quot;x&quot; follows formula_345 with known mean μ, the conjugate prior of the variance has an inverse gamma distribution or a scaled inverse chi-squared distribution. The two are equivalent except for having different parameterizations. Although the inverse gamma is more commonly used, we use the scaled inverse chi-squared for the sake of convenience. The prior for σ2 is as follows:

formula_357

The likelihood function from above, written in terms of the variance, is:

formula_358

where

formula_359

Then:

formula_360

The above is also a scaled inverse chi-squared distribution where

formula_361

or equivalently

formula_362

Reparameterizing in terms of an inverse gamma distribution, the result is:

formula_363

==== With unknown mean and unknown variance ====
For a set of i.i.d. normally distributed data points X of size &quot;n&quot; where each individual point &quot;x&quot; follows formula_345 with unknown mean μ and unknown variance σ2, a combined (multivariate) conjugate prior is placed over the mean and variance, consisting of a normal-inverse-gamma distribution.
Logically, this originates as follows:
# From the analysis of the case with unknown mean but known variance, we see that the update equations involve sufficient statistics computed from the data consisting of the mean of the data points and the total variance of the data points, computed in turn from the known variance divided by the number of data points.
# From the analysis of the case with unknown variance but known mean, we see that the update equations involve sufficient statistics over the data consisting of the number of data points and sum of squared deviations.
# Keep in mind that the posterior update values serve as the prior distribution when further data is handled. Thus, we should logically think of our priors in terms of the sufficient statistics just described, with the same semantics kept in mind as much as possible.
# To handle the case where both mean and variance are unknown, we could place independent priors over the mean and variance, with fixed estimates of the average mean, total variance, number of data points used to compute the variance prior, and sum of squared deviations. Note however that in reality, the total variance of the mean depends on the unknown variance, and the sum of squared deviations that goes into the variance prior (appears to) depend on the unknown mean. In practice, the latter dependence is relatively unimportant: Shifting the actual mean shifts the generated points by an equal amount, and on average the squared deviations will remain the same. This is not the case, however, with the total variance of the mean: As the unknown variance increases, the total variance of the mean will increase proportionately, and we would like to capture this dependence.
# This suggests that we create a &quot;conditional prior&quot; of the mean on the unknown variance, with a hyperparameter specifying the mean of the pseudo-observations associated with the prior, and another parameter specifying the number of pseudo-observations. This number serves as a scaling parameter on the variance, making it possible to control the overall variance of the mean relative to the actual variance parameter. The prior for the variance also has two hyperparameters, one specifying the sum of squared deviations of the pseudo-observations associated with the prior, and another specifying once again the number of pseudo-observations. Each of the priors has a hyperparameter specifying the number of pseudo-observations, and in each case this controls the relative variance of that prior. These are given as two separate hyperparameters so that the variance (aka the confidence) of the two priors can be controlled separately.
# This leads immediately to the normal-inverse-gamma distribution, which is the product of the two distributions just defined, with conjugate priors used (an inverse gamma distribution over the variance, and a normal distribution over the mean, &quot;conditional&quot; on the variance) and with the same four parameters just defined.

The priors are normally defined as follows:

formula_365
The update equations can be derived, and look as follows:

formula_366

The respective numbers of pseudo-observations add the number of actual observations to them. The new mean hyperparameter is once again a weighted average, this time weighted by the relative numbers of observations. Finally, the update for formula_367 is similar to the case with known mean, but in this case the sum of squared deviations is taken with respect to the observed data mean rather than the true mean, and as a result a new interaction term needs to be added to take care of the additional error source stemming from the deviation between prior and data mean.

} \exp\left(-\frac{n_0}{2\sigma^2}(\mu-\mu_0)^2\right) \\
&amp;\propto (\sigma^2)^{-1/2} \exp\left(-\frac{n_0}{2\sigma^2}(\mu-\mu_0)^2\right) \\
p(\sigma^2; \nu_0,\sigma_0^2) &amp;\sim I\chi^2(\nu_0,\sigma_0^2) = IG(\nu_0/2, \nu_0\sigma_0^2/2) \\
&amp;= \frac{(\sigma_0^2\nu_0/2)^{\nu_0/2}}{\Gamma(\nu_0/2)}~\frac{\exp\left[ \frac{-\nu_0 \sigma_0^2}{2 \sigma^2}\right]}{(\sigma^2)^{1+\nu_0/2}} \\
&amp;\propto {(\sigma^2)^{-(1+\nu_0/2)}} \exp\left[ \frac{-\nu_0 \sigma_0^2}{2 \sigma^2}\right].
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the joint prior is

formula_368

The likelihood function from the section above with known variance is:

formula_369

Writing it in terms of variance rather than precision, we get:
formula_370
where formula_371

Therefore, the posterior is (dropping the hyperparameters as conditioning factors):
formula_372

In other words, the posterior distribution has the form of a product of a normal distribution over formula_373 times an inverse gamma distribution over formula_374, with parameters that are the same as the update equations above.

==Occurrence and applications==
The occurrence of normal distribution in practical problems can be loosely classified into four categories:
# Exactly normal distributions;
# Approximately normal laws, for example when such approximation is justified by the central limit theorem; and
# Distributions modeled as normal – the normal distribution being the distribution with maximum entropy for a given mean and variance.
# Regression problems – the normal distribution being found after systematic effects have been modeled sufficiently well.

=== Exact normality ===

Certain quantities in physics are distributed normally, as was first demonstrated by James Clerk Maxwell. Examples of such quantities are:
* Probability density function of a ground state in a quantum harmonic oscillator.
* The position of a particle that experiences diffusion. If initially the particle is located at a specific point (that is its probability distribution is the Dirac delta function), then after time &quot;t&quot; its location is described by a normal distribution with variance &quot;t&quot;, which satisfies the diffusion equation formula_375. If the initial location is given by a certain density function formula_376, then the density at time &quot;t&quot; is the convolution of &quot;g&quot; and the normal probability density function.

=== Approximate normality ===
&quot;Approximately&quot; normal distributions occur in many situations, as explained by the central limit theorem. When the outcome is produced by many small effects acting &quot;additively and independently&quot;, its distribution will be close to normal. The normal approximation will not be valid if the effects act multiplicatively (instead of additively), or if there is a single external influence that has a considerably larger magnitude than the rest of the effects.
* In counting problems, where the central limit theorem includes a discrete-to-continuum approximation and where infinitely divisible and decomposable distributions are involved, such as
** Binomial random variables, associated with binary response variables;
** Poisson random variables, associated with rare events;
* Thermal radiation has a Bose–Einstein distribution on very short time scales, and a normal distribution on longer timescales due to the central limit theorem.

=== Assumed normality ===
There are statistical methods to empirically test that assumption; see the above Normality tests section.
* In biology, the &quot;logarithm&quot; of various variables tend to have a normal distribution, that is, they tend to have a log-normal distribution (after separation on male/female subpopulations), with examples including:
** Measures of size of living tissue (length, height, skin area, weight);
** The &quot;length&quot; of &quot;inert&quot; appendages (hair, claws, nails, teeth) of biological specimens, &quot;in the direction of growth&quot;; presumably the thickness of tree bark also falls under this category;
** Certain physiological measurements, such as blood pressure of adult humans.
* In finance, in particular the Black–Scholes model, changes in the &quot;logarithm&quot; of exchange rates, price indices, and stock market indices are assumed normal (these variables behave like compound interest, not like simple interest, and so are multiplicative). Some mathematicians such as Benoit Mandelbrot have argued that log-Levy distributions, which possesses heavy tails would be a more appropriate model, in particular for the analysis for stock market crashes. The use of the assumption of normal distribution occurring in financial models has also been criticized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his works.
* Measurement errors in physical experiments are often modeled by a normal distribution. This use of a normal distribution does not imply that one is assuming the measurement errors are normally distributed, rather using the normal distribution produces the most conservative predictions possible given only knowledge about the mean and variance of the errors.
* In standardized testing, results can be made to have a normal distribution by either selecting the number and difficulty of questions (as in the IQ test) or transforming the raw test scores into output scores by fitting them to the normal distribution. For example, the SAT&#x27;s traditional range of 200–800 is based on a normal distribution with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100.

* Many scores are derived from the normal distribution, including percentile ranks (percentiles or quantiles), normal curve equivalents, stanines, z-scores, and T-scores. Additionally, some behavioral statistical procedures assume that scores are normally distributed; for example, t-tests and ANOVAs. Bell curve grading assigns relative grades based on a normal distribution of scores.
* In hydrology the distribution of long duration river discharge or rainfall, e.g. monthly and yearly totals, is often thought to be practically normal according to the central limit theorem. The blue picture, made with CumFreq, illustrates an example of fitting the normal distribution to ranked October rainfalls showing the 90% confidence belt based on the binomial distribution. The rainfall data are represented by plotting positions as part of the cumulative frequency analysis.

=== Methodological problems and peer review ===
John Ioannidis argued that using normally distributed standard deviations as standards for validating research findings leave falsifiable predictions about phenomena that are not normally distributed untested. This includes, for example, phenomena that only appear when all necessary conditions are present and one cannot be a substitute for another in an addition-like way and phenomena that are not randomly distributed. Ioannidis argues that standard deviation-centered validation gives a false appearance of validity to hypotheses and theories where some but not all falsifiable predictions are normally distributed since the portion of falsifiable predictions that there is evidence against may and in some cases are in the non-normally distributed parts of the range of falsifiable predictions, as well as baselessly dismissing hypotheses for which none of the falsifiable predictions are normally distributed as if were they unfalsifiable when in fact they do make falsifiable predictions. It is argued by Ioannidis that many cases of mutually exclusive theories being accepted as validated by research journals are caused by failure of the journals to take in empirical falsifications of non-normally distributed predictions, and not because mutually exclusive theories are true, which they cannot be, although two mutually exclusive theories can both be wrong and a third one correct.

== Computational methods ==
=== Generating values from normal distribution ===
In computer simulations, especially in applications of the Monte-Carlo method, it is often desirable to generate values that are normally distributed. The algorithms listed below all generate the standard normal deviates, since a can be generated as , where &quot;Z&quot; is standard normal. All these algorithms rely on the availability of a random number generator &quot;U&quot; capable of producing uniform random variates.
* The most straightforward method is based on the probability integral transform property: if &quot;U&quot; is distributed uniformly on (0,1), then Φ−1(&quot;U&quot;) will have the standard normal distribution. The drawback of this method is that it relies on calculation of the probit function Φ−1, which cannot be done analytically. Some approximate methods are described in and in the erf article. Wichura gives a fast algorithm for computing this function to 16 decimal places, which is used by R to compute random variates of the normal distribution.
* An easy-to-program approximate approach that relies on the central limit theorem is as follows: generate 12 uniform &quot;U&quot;(0,1) deviates, add them all up, and subtract 6 – the resulting random variable will have approximately standard normal distribution. In truth, the distribution will be Irwin–Hall, which is a 12-section eleventh-order polynomial approximation to the normal distribution. This random deviate will have a limited range of (−6, 6). Note that in a true normal distribution, only 0.00034% of all samples will fall outside ±6σ.
* The Box–Muller method uses two independent random numbers &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; distributed uniformly on (0,1). Then the two random variables &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; formula_377 will both have the standard normal distribution, and will be independent. This formulation arises because for a bivariate normal random vector (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) the squared norm will have the chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom, which is an easily generated exponential random variable corresponding to the quantity −2 ln(&quot;U&quot;) in these equations; and the angle is distributed uniformly around the circle, chosen by the random variable &quot;V&quot;.
* The Marsaglia polar method is a modification of the Box–Muller method which does not require computation of the sine and cosine functions. In this method, &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; are drawn from the uniform (−1,1) distribution, and then is computed. If &quot;S&quot; is greater or equal to 1, then the method starts over, otherwise the two quantities formula_378 are returned. Again, &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are independent, standard normal random variables.
* The Ratio method is a rejection method. The algorithm proceeds as follows:
** Generate two independent uniform deviates &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot;;
** Compute &quot;X&quot; = (&quot;V&quot; − 0.5)/&quot;U&quot;;
** Optional: if &quot;X&quot;2 ≤ 5 − 4&quot;e&quot;1/4&quot;U&quot; then accept &quot;X&quot; and terminate algorithm;
** Optional: if &quot;X&quot;2 ≥ 4&quot;e&quot;−1.35/&quot;U&quot; + 1.4 then reject &quot;X&quot; and start over from step 1;
** If &quot;X&quot;2 ≤ −4 ln&quot;U&quot; then accept &quot;X&quot;, otherwise start over the algorithm.
*: The two optional steps allow the evaluation of the logarithm in the last step to be avoided in most cases. These steps can be greatly improved so that the logarithm is rarely evaluated.
* The ziggurat algorithm is faster than the Box–Muller transform and still exact. In about 97% of all cases it uses only two random numbers, one random integer and one random uniform, one multiplication and an if-test. Only in 3% of the cases, where the combination of those two falls outside the &quot;core of the ziggurat&quot; (a kind of rejection sampling using logarithms), do exponentials and more uniform random numbers have to be employed.
* Integer arithmetic can be used to sample from the standard normal distribution. This method is exact in the sense that it satisfies the conditions of &quot;ideal approximation&quot;; i.e., it is equivalent to sampling a real number from the standard normal distribution and rounding this to the nearest representable floating point number.
* There is also some investigation into the connection between the fast Hadamard transform and the normal distribution, since the transform employs just addition and subtraction and by the central limit theorem random numbers from almost any distribution will be transformed into the normal distribution. In this regard a series of Hadamard transforms can be combined with random permutations to turn arbitrary data sets into a normally distributed data.

=== Numerical approximations for the normal cumulative distribution function and normal quantile function ===
The standard normal cumulative distribution function is widely used in scientific and statistical computing.

The values Φ(&quot;x&quot;) may be approximated very accurately by a variety of methods, such as numerical integration, Taylor series, asymptotic series and continued fractions. Different approximations are used depending on the desired level of accuracy.
* give the approximation for Φ(&quot;x&quot;) for &quot;x&quot; &gt; 0 with the absolute error (algorithm 26.2.17): formula_379 where &quot;ϕ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the standard normal probability density function, and &quot;b&quot;0 = 0.2316419, &quot;b&quot;1 = 0.319381530, &quot;b&quot;2 = −0.356563782, &quot;b&quot;3 = 1.781477937, &quot;b&quot;4 = −1.821255978, &quot;b&quot;5 = 1.330274429.
* lists some dozens of approximations – by means of rational functions, with or without exponentials – for the function. His algorithms vary in the degree of complexity and the resulting precision, with maximum absolute precision of 24 digits. An algorithm by combines Hart&#x27;s algorithm 5666 with a continued fraction approximation in the tail to provide a fast computation algorithm with a 16-digit precision.
* after recalling Hart68 solution is not suited for erf, gives a solution for both erf and erfc, with maximal relative error bound, via Rational Chebyshev Approximation.
* suggested a simple algorithm based on the Taylor series expansion formula_380 for calculating with arbitrary precision. The drawback of this algorithm is comparatively slow calculation time (for example it takes over 300 iterations to calculate the function with 16 digits of precision when ).
* The GNU Scientific Library calculates values of the standard normal cumulative distribution function using Hart&#x27;s algorithms and approximations with Chebyshev polynomials.
* proposes the following approximation of formula_381 with a maximum relative error less than formula_382 formula_383 in absolute value: for formula_384formula_385 and for formula_386,
formula_387

Shore (1982) introduced simple approximations that may be incorporated in stochastic optimization models of engineering and operations research, like reliability engineering and inventory analysis. Denoting , the simplest approximation for the quantile function is:
formula_388

This approximation delivers for &quot;z&quot; a maximum absolute error of 0.026 (for , corresponding to ). For replace &quot;p&quot; by and change sign. Another approximation, somewhat less accurate, is the single-parameter approximation:
formula_389

The latter had served to derive a simple approximation for the loss integral of the normal distribution, defined by
formula_390

This approximation is particularly accurate for the right far-tail (maximum error of 10−3 for z≥1.4). Highly accurate approximations for the cumulative distribution function, based on Response Modeling Methodology (RMM, Shore, 2011, 2012), are shown in Shore (2005).

Some more approximations can be found at: Error function#Approximation with elementary functions. In particular, small &quot;relative&quot; error on the whole domain for the cumulative distribution function and the quantile function formula_391 as well, is achieved via an explicitly invertible formula by Sergei Winitzki in 2008.

== History ==

=== Development ===
Some authors attribute the discovery of the normal distribution to de Moivre, who in 1738 published in the second edition of his &quot;The Doctrine of Chances&quot; the study of the coefficients in the binomial expansion of . De Moivre proved that the middle term in this expansion has the approximate magnitude of formula_392, and that &quot;If &quot;m&quot; or &quot;n&quot; be a Quantity infinitely great, then the Logarithm of the Ratio, which a Term distant from the middle by the Interval &quot;ℓ&quot;, has to the middle Term, is formula_393.&quot; Although this theorem can be interpreted as the first obscure expression for the normal probability law, Stigler points out that de Moivre himself did not interpret his results as anything more than the approximate rule for the binomial coefficients, and in particular de Moivre lacked the concept of the probability density function.

In 1823 Gauss published his monograph &quot;Theoria combinationis observationum erroribus minimis obnoxiae&quot; where among other things he introduces several important statistical concepts, such as the method of least squares, the method of maximum likelihood, and the &quot;normal distribution&quot;. Gauss used &quot;M&quot;, , to denote the measurements of some unknown quantity &quot;V&quot;, and sought the most probable estimator of that quantity: the one that maximizes the probability of obtaining the observed experimental results. In his notation φΔ is the probability density function of the measurement errors of magnitude Δ. Not knowing what the function &quot;φ&quot; is, Gauss requires that his method should reduce to the well-known answer: the arithmetic mean of the measured values. Starting from these principles, Gauss demonstrates that the only law that rationalizes the choice of arithmetic mean as an estimator of the location parameter, is the normal law of errors:
formula_394 
where &quot;h&quot; is &quot;the measure of the precision of the observations&quot;. Using this normal law as a generic model for errors in the experiments, Gauss formulates what is now known as the non-linear weighted least squares method.

Although Gauss was the first to suggest the normal distribution law, Laplace made significant contributions. It was Laplace who first posed the problem of aggregating several observations in 1774, although his own solution led to the Laplacian distribution. It was Laplace who first calculated the value of the integral in 1782, providing the normalization constant for the normal distribution. For this accomplishment, Gauss acknowledged the priority of Laplace. Finally, it was Laplace who in 1810 proved and presented to the academy the fundamental central limit theorem, which emphasized the theoretical importance of the normal distribution.

It is of interest to note that in 1809 an Irish-American mathematician Robert Adrain published two insightful but flawed derivations of the normal probability law, simultaneously and independently from Gauss. His works remained largely unnoticed by the scientific community, until in 1871 they were exhumed by Abbe.

In the middle of the 19th century Maxwell demonstrated that the normal distribution is not just a convenient mathematical tool, but may also occur in natural phenomena: The number of particles whose velocity, resolved in a certain direction, lies between &quot;x&quot; and &quot;x&quot; + &quot;dx&quot; is
formula_395 

=== Naming ===
Today, the concept is usually known in English as the normal distribution or Gaussian distribution. Other less common names include Gauss distribution, Laplace–Gauss distribution, the law of error, the law of facility of errors, Laplace&#x27;s second law, and Gaussian law.

Gauss himself apparently coined the term with reference to the &quot;normal equations&quot; involved in its applications, with normal having its technical meaning of orthogonal rather than usual. However, by the end of the 19th century some authors had started using the name &quot;normal distribution&quot;, where the word &quot;normal&quot; was used as an adjective – the term now being seen as a reflection of the fact that this distribution was seen as typical, common – and thus normal. Peirce (one of those authors) once defined &quot;normal&quot; thus: &quot;...the &#x27;normal&#x27; is not the average (or any other kind of mean) of what actually occurs, but of what &quot;would&quot;, in the long run, occur under certain circumstances.&quot; Around the turn of the 20th century Pearson popularized the term &quot;normal&quot; as a designation for this distribution.
Also, it was Pearson who first wrote the distribution in terms of the standard deviation &quot;σ&quot; as in modern notation. Soon after this, in year 1915, Fisher added the location parameter to the formula for normal distribution, expressing it in the way it is written nowadays:
formula_396

The term &quot;standard normal&quot;, which denotes the normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance came into general use around the 1950s, appearing in the popular textbooks by P. G. Hoel (1947) &quot;Introduction to Mathematical Statistics&quot; and A. M. Mood (1950) &quot;Introduction to the Theory of Statistics&quot;.

<text>Niklas Luhmann (; ; December 8, 1927 – November 11, 1998) was a German sociologist, philosopher of social science, and one main inventer of systems theory.

Niklas Luhmann is one of the most influential German sociologists of the 20th century. His thinking was based on the philosophical tradition and at the same time the reception of a wide variety of concepts from modern science. From this foundation he developed a functionalist-oriented systems theory, which claims to be able to describe all social phenomena in a theoretically consistent language. 

Social systems are understood as communication contexts that have autonomy from the actors involved in them. On this basis, three types of social systems can be distinguished: interaction, organization and society. 

On his general theory he developed a social theory, which describes modern society as a global society that is characterized by an internal differentiation into various autonomously working &quot;functional areas&quot; such as politics, law, economics, science, religion and art. According to Luhmann, their operations can not be coordinated centrally.

==Biography==
Luhmann was born in Lüneburg, Free State of Prussia, where his father&#x27;s family had been running a brewery for several generations. He entered the Gymnasium Johanneum at Luneburg in 1937. In 1943, he was conscripted as a Luftwaffenhelfer in World War II and served for two years until, at the age of 17, he was taken prisoner of war by American troops in 1945. After the war Luhmann studied law at the University of Freiburg from 1946 to 1949, where he obtained a law degree, and then began a career in Lüneburg&#x27;s public administration. During a sabbatical in 1961, he went to Harvard, where he met and studied under Talcott Parsons, then the world&#x27;s most influential social systems theorist.

In later days, Luhmann dismissed Parsons&#x27; theory, developing a rival approach of his own. Leaving the civil service in 1962, he lectured at the national Deutsche Hochschule für Verwaltungswissenschaften (University for Administrative Sciences) in Speyer, Germany. In 1965, he was offered a position at the (Social Research Centre of the University of Münster), led by Helmut Schelsky.
From 1965/66 he studied one semester of sociology at the University of Münster.

Two earlier books were retroactively accepted as a PhD thesis and habilitation at the University of Münster in 1966, qualifying him for a university professorship. In 1968/1969, he briefly served as a lecturer at Theodor Adorno&#x27;s former chair at the University of Frankfurt and then was appointed full professor of sociology at the newly founded University of Bielefeld, Germany (until 1993). When asked about his research plan, he said, &quot;The theory of modern society. Duration 30 years. No costs.&quot;

He continued to publish after his retirement, when he finally found the time to complete his magnum opus, &quot;Die Gesellschaft der Gesellschaft&quot; (literally, &quot;The Society of Society&quot;), which was published in 1997, and has been translated into English as &quot;Theory of Society&quot; (volume I in 2012 and volume II in 2013). This work describes segmented societies divided into specialized functional subsystems.

==Works==
Luhmann wrote prolifically, with more than 70 books and nearly 400 scholarly articles published on a variety of subjects, including law, economy, politics, art, religion, ecology, mass media, and love. While his theories have yet to make a major mark in American sociology, his theory is currently well known and popular in German sociology, and has also been rather intensively received in Japan, Scandinavia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, including in Russia. His relatively low profile elsewhere is partly due to the fact that translating his work is a difficult task, since his writing presents a challenge even to readers of German, including many sociologists. (p. xxvii Social Systems 1995)

Much of Luhmann&#x27;s work directly deals with the operations of the legal system and his autopoietic theory of law is regarded as one of the more influential contributions to the sociology of law and socio-legal studies.

Luhmann is probably best known to North Americans for his debate with the critical theorist Jürgen Habermas over the potential of social systems theory. Like his erstwhile mentor Talcott Parsons, Luhmann is an advocate of &quot;grand theory&quot;, although neither in the sense of philosophical foundationalism nor in the sense of &quot;meta-narrative&quot; as often invoked in the critical works of post-modernist writers. Rather, Luhmann&#x27;s work tracks closer to complexity theory, broadly speaking, in that it aims to address any aspect of social life within a universal theoretical framework—as the diversity of subjects he wrote on indicates. Luhmann&#x27;s theory is sometimes dismissed as highly abstract and complex, particularly within the Anglophone world, whereas his work has had a more lasting influence on scholars from German-speaking countries, Scandinavia and Italy.

Luhmann himself described his theory as &quot;labyrinthine&quot; or &quot;non-linear&quot;, and claimed he was deliberately keeping his prose enigmatic to prevent it from being understood &quot;too quickly&quot;, which would only produce simplistic misunderstandings.

===Systems theory===
Luhmann&#x27;s systems theory focuses on three topics, which are interconnected in his entire work.
# Systems theory as societal theory
# Communication theory and
# Evolution theory
The core element of Luhmann&#x27;s theory pivots around the problem of the contingency of meaning, and thereby it becomes a theory of communication. Social systems are systems of communication, and society is the most encompassing social system. Being the social system that comprises all (and only) communication, today&#x27;s society is a world society. A system is defined by a boundary between itself and its environment, dividing it from an infinitely complex, or (colloquially) chaotic, exterior. The interior of the system is thus a zone of reduced complexity: communication within a system operates by selecting only a limited amount of all information available outside. This process is also called &quot;reduction of complexity&quot;. The criterion according to which information is selected and processed is meaning (in German, &quot;Sinn&quot;). Meaning being thereby referral from one set of potential space to another set of potential space. Both social systems and psychic systems (see below for an explanation of this distinction) operate by processing meaning.

Furthermore, each system has a distinctive identity that is constantly reproduced in its communication and depends on what is considered meaningful and what is not. If a system fails to maintain that identity, it ceases to exist as a system and dissolves back into the environment it emerged from. Luhmann called this process of reproduction from elements previously filtered from an over-complex environment autopoiesis (pronounced &quot;auto-poy-E-sis&quot;; literally: self-creation), using a term coined in cognitive biology by Chilean thinkers Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela. Social systems are &quot;operationally closed&quot; in that while they use and rely on resources from their environment, those resources do not become part of the systems&#x27; operation. Both thought and digestion are important preconditions for communication, but neither appears in communication as such.

Maturana, however, argued very vocally that this appropriation of autopoietic theory was conceptually unsound, as it presupposes the autonomy of communications from actual persons. That is, by describing social systems as operationally closed networks of communications, Luhmann (according to Maturana) ignores the fact that communications presuppose human communicators. Autopoiesis only applies to networks of processes that reproduce themselves, but communications are reproduced by humans. For this reason, the analogy from biology to sociology does not, in this case, hold. On the other hand, Luhmann explicitly stressed that he does not refer to a &quot;society without humans&quot;, but to the fact that communication is autopoietic. Communication is made possible by human bodies and consciousness, but this does not make communication operationally open. To &quot;participate&quot; in communication, one must be able to render one&#x27;s thoughts and perceptions into elements of communication. This can only ever occur as a communicative operation (thoughts and perceptions cannot be directly transmitted) and must therefore satisfy internal system conditions that are specific to communication: intelligibility, reaching an addressee and gaining acceptance.

Luhmann likens the operation of autopoiesis (the filtering and processing of information from the environment) to a program; making a series of logical distinctions (in German, &quot;Unterscheidungen&quot;). Here, Luhmann refers to the British mathematician G. Spencer-Brown&#x27;s logic of distinctions that Maturana and Varela had earlier identified as a model for the functioning of any cognitive process. The supreme criterion guiding the &quot;self-creation&quot; of any given system is a defining binary code. This binary code is not to be confused with a computer&#x27;s operation: Luhmann (following Spencer-Brown and Gregory Bateson) assumes that auto-referential systems are continuously confronted with the dilemma of disintegration/continuation. This dilemma is framed with an ever-changing set of available choices; every one of those potential choices can be the system&#x27;s selection or not (a binary state, selected/rejected). The influence of Spencer-Brown&#x27;s book, &quot;Laws of Form&quot;, on Luhmann can hardly be overestimated.

Although Luhmann first developed his understanding of social systems theory under Parsons&#x27; influence, he soon moved away from the Parsonian concept. The most important difference is that Parsons framed systems as forms of action, in accordance with the AGIL paradigm. Parsons&#x27; systems theory treats systems as operationally open, and interactive through an input and output schema. Influenced by second-order cybernetics, Luhmann instead treats systems as autopoietic and operationally closed. Systems must continually construct themselves and their perspective of reality through processing the distinction between system and environment, and self-reproduce themselves as the product of their own elements. Social systems are defined by Luhmann not as action but as recursive communication. Modern society is defined as a world system consisting of the sum total of all communication happening at once, and individual function systems (such as the economy, politics, science, love, art, the media, etc.) are described as social subsystems which have &quot;outdifferentiated&quot; from the social system and achieved their own operational closure and autopoiesis.

Another difference is that Parsons asks how certain subsystems contribute to the functioning of overall society. Luhmann starts with the differentiation of the systems themselves out of a nondescript environment. While he does observe how certain systems fulfill functions that contribute to &quot;society&quot; as a whole, he dispenses with the assumption of &quot;a priori&quot; cultural or normative consensus or &quot;complimentary purpose&quot; which was common to Durkheim and Parsons&#x27; conceptualization of a social function. For Luhmann, functional differentiation is a consequence of selective pressure under temporalized complexity, and it occurs as function systems independently establish their own ecological niches by performing a function. Functions are therefore not the coordinated components of the organic social whole, but rather contingent and selective responses to reference problems which obey no higher principle of order and could have been responded to in other ways.

Finally, the systems&#x27; autopoietic closure is another fundamental difference from Parsons&#x27; concept. Each system works strictly according to its very own code and can observe other systems only by applying its code to their operations. For example, the code of the economy involves the application of the distinction between payment and non-payment. Other system operations appear within the economic field of references only insofar as this economic code can be applied to them. Hence, a political decision becomes an economic operation when it is observed as a government spending money or not. Likewise, a legal judgement may also be an economic operation when settlement of a contractual dispute obliges one party to pay for the goods or services they had acquired. The codes of the economy, politics and law operate autonomously, but their &quot;interpenetration&quot; is evident when observing &quot;events&quot; which simultaneously involve the participation of more than one system.

One seemingly peculiar, but, within the overall framework, strictly logical, axiom of Luhmann&#x27;s theory is the human being&#x27;s position outside the strict boundaries of any social system, as initially developed by Parsons. Consisting of, but not being solely constituted by, &quot;communicative actions&quot; (a reference to Jürgen Habermas), any social system requires human consciousnesses (personal or psychical systems) as an obviously necessary, but nevertheless environmental resource. In Luhmann&#x27;s terms, human beings are neither part of society nor of any specific system, just as they are not part of a conversation. People make conversation possible. Luhmann himself once said concisely that he was &quot;not interested in people&quot;. That is not to say that people were not a matter for Luhmann, but rather alluding to the scope of the theory where, the communicative behavior of people is constituted (but not defined) by the dynamics of the social system, and society is constituted (but not defined) by the communicative behavior of people: society is people&#x27;s environment, and people are society&#x27;s environment.

Thus, sociology can explain how persons can change society; the influence of the environment (the people) on a given social system (a society), the so-called &quot;structural coupling&quot; of &quot;partially interpenetrating systems&quot;. 
In fact Luhmann himself replied to the relevant criticism by stating that, &quot;In fact the theory of autopoietic systems could bear the title &quot;Taking Individuals Seriously&quot;, certainly more seriously than our humanistic tradition&quot; (Niklas Luhmann, &quot;Operational Closure and Structural Coupling: The Differentiation of the Legal System&quot;, Cardozo Law Review, vol. 13: 1422). 
Luhmann was devoted to the ideal of non-normative science introduced to sociology in the early 20th century by Max Weber and later re-defined and defended against its critics by Karl Popper. However, in an academic environment that never strictly separated descriptive and normative theories of society, Luhmann&#x27;s sociology has widely attracted criticism from various intellectuals, including Jürgen Habermas.

===Luhmann&#x27;s reception===
Luhmann&#x27;s systems theory is not without its critics; his definitions of &quot;autopoietic&quot; and &quot;social system&quot; differ from others.
At the same time, his theory is being applied worldwide by sociologists and other scholars. It is often used in analyses dealing with corporate social responsibility, organisational legitimacy, governance structures as well as with sociology of law, and of course general sociology. His systems theory has also been used to study media discourse of various energy technologies throughout the US, including smart grids, carbon capture and storage, and wind energy, but also to highlight how diplomacy differs from politics as these two may pose two distinct systems with distinct functions and distinct media (peace and power, respectively).

His approach has attracted criticism from those who argue that Luhmann has at no point demonstrated the operational closure of social systems, or in fact that autopoietic social systems actually exist. He has instead taken this as a premise or presupposition, resulting in the logical need to exclude humans from social systems, which prevents the social systems view from accounting for the individual behavior, action, motives, or indeed existence of any individual person.

=== Note-taking system (&quot;Zettelkasten&quot;) ===
Luhmann was famous for his extensive use of the &quot;slip box&quot; or &quot;Zettelkasten&quot; note-taking method. The notes were probably created between 1952 and the beginning of 1997. He used them to systematically organize the results of his excessive and broadly interdisciplinary reading. Luhmann built up a zettelkasten of some 90,000 index cards for his research, and credited it with making his extraordinarily prolific writing possible. 

The notes were digitized and made available online by his former Unisverity Bielefeld in 2019. Luhmann described the zettelkasten as part of his research into systems theory in the essay &quot;Kommunikation mit Zettelkästen&quot; (&quot;Communication with slip boxes)&quot; (probably published in 1980/81).

===Miscellaneous===
Luhmann also appears as a character in Paul Wühr&#x27;s work of literature &quot;Das falsche Buch&quot;, along with , Johann Georg Hamann, Richard Buckminster Fuller and others.

Luhmann owned a pub called &quot;Pons&quot; in his parents&#x27; house in his native town of Lüneburg. The house, which also contained his father&#x27;s brewery, had been in his family since 1857.

<text>Natacha Atlas (, , ; born 20 March 1964) is an Egyptian-Belgian singer known for her fusion of Arabic and Western music, particularly hip-hop. She once termed her music &quot;cha&#x27;abi moderne&quot; (modern folk music). Her music has been influenced by many styles including Maghrebain, hip hop, drum and bass and reggae.

Atlas began her career as part of the world fusion group Transglobal Underground. In 1995, she began to focus on her solo career with the release of &quot;Diaspora&quot;. She has since released seven solo albums and been a part of numerous collaborations. Her version of &quot;Mon amie la rose&quot; became a surprise success in France, reaching 16 on the French Singles Charts in 1999. Her most recent album, &quot;Strange Days&quot;, was released in 2019.

==Early life==
Natacha Atlas was born on 20 March 1964, in Schaerbeek, Brussels-Capital, Belgium. Her British mother was raised Christian before adopting Buddhism in the 1970s. Her father, of Egyptian descent, was deeply interested in Sufi mysticism and the Gurdjieff philosophy of the Fourth Way. He also studied Chinese medicine and Taoism.

Atlas was raised listening to eclectic music from both Eastern and Western traditions. After her parents separated, Atlas went to live in Northampton, England, with her mother.

Atlas grew up speaking French and English, and later learned Arabic and Spanish. She sings in several languages, including modern colloquial Arabic, although she admits that she is not entirely at ease with it.

==Early career and Transglobal Underground==
Atlas returned to Belgium at age 24 and began her career with two jobs: belly dancing and being the lead singer of a Belgian salsa band. In April 1989, she made her recording début as guest vocalist on Balearic beat-band ¡Loca!&#x27;s &quot;Encantador&quot; (Nation Records).

In 1991, Atlas co-wrote/recorded the ¡Loca! single &quot;Timbal&quot; and co-wrote/guested with Jah Wobble&#x27;s Invaders of the Heart composing five tracks for their &quot;Rising Above Bedlam&quot; album. Through recording with ¡Loca!, she met Nation-labelmates Transglobal Underground, a British ethnic electronica band with a Middle Eastern/South Asian focus. At the time, Transglobal Underground had a top 40 hit, &quot;Templehead&quot;, and Atlas became their lead singer and belly dancer. Additionally in 1991, Atlas collaborated with Bauhaus/Love and Rockets/Tones on Tail guitarist and vocalist Daniel Ash on his debut solo album &quot;Coming Down&quot;. She contributed extensive vocal work as well as keyboards and bass guitar.

==Solo career==
Most of Atlas&#x27; earlier albums were produced by Tim Whelan and Hamilton Lee from Transglobal Underground. These albums include &quot;Diaspora&quot; (1995), &quot;Halim&quot; (1997) (in honour of Egyptian singer Abdel Halim Hafez), &quot;Gedida&quot; (1998), and &quot;Ayeshteni&quot; (2001).

Atlas has always spoken her mind about the way both she and Transglobal Underground were seen by the UK press back in the late 1990s and early 2000s. &quot;Someone from the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; rang us about a feature we&#x27;re to do with them and said &#x27;We don&#x27;t want it to be about the multi-cultural angle&#x27;. In other words that fad is over. And I&#x27;m personally insulted... what other angle is there for us?! I get sick of it all.&quot;

In 1999, Atlas collaborated with David Arnold on the song &quot;One Brief Moment&quot;. The single featured a cover version of the theme song from the James Bond film &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;. Two years earlier, Atlas collaborated with Arnold on the album &quot;Shaken and Stirred&quot;, recording the song &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; for the eponymous film (originally performed by Matt Monro).

Also in 1999, she collaborated with Jean-Michel Jarre for the track &quot;C&#x27;est la vie&quot; on his album &quot;Métamorphoses&quot;. The track was released as a single.

In 2003, Atlas provided vocals for the Kolo folk dance song &quot;&#x27;Ajde Jano&quot; on Nigel Kennedy and Kroke&#x27;s album, &quot;East Meets East&quot;. In 2005, she contributed the song &quot;Just Like A Dream&quot; (from &quot;Something Dangerous&quot;) to the charity album &quot;Voyces United for UNHCR&quot;.

Her music has been used in a number of soundtracks. Her song &quot;Kidda&quot; was featured on the &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot; soundtrack and in the 2005 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories&quot; on Radio del Mundo. In 2003, her voice can be heard in the film &quot;Hulk&quot; on the song &quot;Captured&quot;. Additionally, her song &quot;Bathaddak&quot; is one of the songs included in the 2007 Xbox 360 video game &quot;Project Gotham Racing 4&quot;. Her cover of &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; was used in the 2002 film &quot;Divine Intervention&quot; by Palestinian director Elia Suleiman.

Atlas was originally billed to star in and provide the soundtrack to the film &quot;Whatever Lola Wants&quot;, directed by Nabil Ayouch. However, shooting delays caused Atlas to only be involved in the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Her song &quot;Gafsa&quot; from her 1997 album &quot;Halim&quot; was used in the main soundtrack of the 2004 Korean film &quot;Bin-Jip&quot; (also known as &quot;3-Iron&quot;) by Kim Ki-Duk. She participated in the piece &quot;Light of Life (Ibelin Reprise)&quot; for the soundtrack of Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot;.

In 2007, Atlas collaborated with Belinda Carlisle for Carlisle&#x27;s seventh album &quot;Voilà&quot;. She contributed additional vocals on songs &quot;Ma jeunesse fout le camp,&quot; &quot;La Vie en rose&quot;, &quot;Bonnie et Clyde&quot; and &quot;Des ronds dans l&#x27;eau.&quot; &quot;Voilà&quot; was released via Rykodisc in the U.K. on 5 February 2007 and in the U.S. the following day.

The 2007 film &quot;Brick Lane&quot; features four songs with vocals by Atlas, &quot;Adam&#x27;s Lullaby&quot;, &quot;Running Through the Night&quot;, &quot;Love Blossoms&quot; and &quot;Rite of Passage&quot;. On 23 May 2008 Atlas released a new album, &quot;Ana Hina&quot;, which was well received by critics.

In 2008, two of Atlas&#x27; songs, &quot;Kidda&quot; and &quot;Ghanwa Bossanova&quot;, were used in Shamim Sarif&#x27;s romantic comedy about two women, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Think Straight&quot;. In 2008, she sang lead in the song &quot;Habibe&quot; from Peter Gabriel&#x27;s long-awaited album and project, &quot;Big Blue Ball&quot;. On 20 September 2010 Atlas released &quot;Mounqaliba&quot;. Co-produced by Samy Bishai, it explored classical instrumentation, jazz and traditional Arabic styles and was inspired by the poems of Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore.

In May 2013, Natacha Atlas released &quot;Expressions: Live in Toulouse&quot;, an album which showcased her expressive voice using largely orchestral arrangements augmented by Middle Eastern percussion.

Atlas moved into the jazz genre with the albums &quot;Myriad Road&quot; (2015), which was produced by French Lebanese musician Ibrahim Maalouf, and &quot;Strange Days&quot; (2019).

==Personal life==
In 1999, Atlas married Syrian kanun player Abdullah Chhadeh. The couple divorced in 2005.

, Atlas was in a relationship with British Egyptian violinist Samy Bishai, who produced her 2010 release &quot;Mounqaliba&quot;. The couple divide their time between London and France.

Atlas has said in the past that she is &quot;technically Muslim&quot; and that she identifies with Sufism. She also stated that her father has some Sephardic Jewish ancestry. Atlas said more recently, &quot;These days I prefer to say that I&#x27;m Anglo-Middle Eastern and leave the religion out of it.&quot; She is, however, open to other forms of spirituality because &quot;it&#x27;s important to be tolerant&quot;.

In 2001, she was appointed by Mary Robinson as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Conference Against Racism. Robinson chose Atlas because &quot;she embodies the message that there is a strength in diversity. That our differences – be they ethnic, racial or religious – are a source of riches to be embraced rather than feared&quot;.

Atlas has been a proponent of The Zeitgeist Movement. She included clips from &quot;&quot; in her 2010 album &quot;Mounqaliba&quot;.

==Political views on Israel==
In a joint interview with the Israeli singer Yasmin Levy, Atlas noted the risk of the collaboration because feelings of anti-Zionism across the Arab world can spill over into anti-Semitism: &quot;Some Arabic artists wouldn&#x27;t even consider working with anyone Jewish.&quot; Of her experience of working with Levy, Atlas said: &quot;We spent a lot of time in this little room, just talking and drinking wine&quot;, recalls Natacha, &quot;and it was like I’d known her all my life. I’d missed that female Middle Eastern company, as most of the Middle Eastern people I know here are men.&quot;

In March 2011, Atlas announced that she had joined the boycott of Israel and had withdrawn from a scheduled performance in Israel. She gave her reasoning as follows:

&quot;I would have personally asked my Israeli fans face-to-face to fight this apartheid with peace in their hearts, but after much deliberation I now see that it would be more effective a statement to not go to Israel until this systemized apartheid is abolished once and for all.&quot;

By May 2014, when she gave a concert at the Méditerranée Festival in Ashdod, Atlas had clearly changed her mind on the issue of boycott:

&quot;For years,&quot; Natacha Atlas told me, &quot;I boycotted Israel and refused to perform here. But when I met a Palestinian fellow who’s married to an Israeli Jewish woman, something in me changed. Suddenly, this chance personal acquaintanceship made me think that maybe there should be another way. There’s nothing easier than to boycott and say that I don’t want to see Israel or meet Israelis or come here and perform. But then what? Where does that get you?&quot;

<doc id="21470" wikidata="Q233729" url="?curid=21470" title="List of national anthems">
<text>Most nation states have an anthem, defined as &quot;a song, as of praise, devotion, or patriotism&quot;; most anthems are either marches or hymns in style. A song or hymn can become a national anthem under the state&#x27;s constitution, by a law enacted by its legislature, or simply by tradition. A royal anthem is a patriotic song similar to a national anthem, but it specifically praises or prays for a monarch or royal dynasty. Such anthems are usually performed at public appearances by the monarch or during other events of royal importance. Some states use their royal anthem as the national anthem, such as the state anthem of Jordan.

There are multiple claimants to the position of oldest national anthem. Among the national anthems, the first to be composed was the Dutch national anthem, the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot;, which was written between 1568 and 1572. This has both Dutch and English language versions and is unusual in being an acrostic in both languages. The Japanese anthem, &quot;Kimigayo&quot;, employs the oldest lyrics of any national anthem, taking its words from the &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot;, which was first published in 905, yet these words were not set to music until 1880. The first anthem to be officially adopted as such was the Spanish anthem &quot;La Marcha Real&quot;, in 1770; its origins remain unclear; it is suggested that it has 16th century Venetian origins, or even that it was composed by king Frederick the Great himself; it is also one of the few national anthems that has never had official lyrics. Anthems became increasingly popular among European states in the 18th century. For example, the British national anthem &quot;God Save the King&quot; was first performed in 1745. The French anthem &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; was written half a century later in 1792, and adopted in 1795.

National anthems are usually written in the most common language of the state, whether &quot;de facto&quot; or official. States with multiple national languages may offer several versions of their anthem. For instance, Switzerland&#x27;s national anthem has different lyrics for each of the country&#x27;s four official languages: French, German, Italian, and Romansh. One of New Zealand&#x27;s two national anthems is commonly sung with the first verse in Māori (&quot;Aotearoa&quot;) and the second in English (&quot;God Defend New Zealand&quot;). The tune is the same but the lyrics have different meanings. South Africa&#x27;s national anthem is unique in that it is two different songs put together with five of the country&#x27;s eleven official languages being used, in which each language comprises a stanza.

Denmark and New Zealand are two countries with two official national anthems of equal status. Denmark has two anthems, Der er et yndigt land (&quot;There is a Lovely Country&quot;) and Kong Christian stod ved højen mast (&quot;King Christian stood by the lofty mast&quot;). Der er et yndigt land is considered the civil national anthem and is often played at civil and sports events. Kong Christian stod ved højen mast is both a royal and national anthem. New Zealand has two anthems, God Defend New Zealand and God Save the King. God Defend New Zealand was added in 1977 after a petition to Parliament and Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s approval. The two anthems are often sung together, with the first verse of God Defend New Zealand in Māori (&quot;Aotearoa&quot;) and the second in English.

India has both a national anthem, Jana-gana-mana, and a national song, Vande Mataram. Jana-gana-mana was originally written in Bengali by Rabindranath Tagore in 1911 and adopted as the national anthem in 1950. Vande Mataram was composed in Sanskritised Bengali by Bankimchandra Chatterjee in the 1870s and inspired people during their fight for freedom.

<text>Nikola Tesla (; ; 10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American engineer, futurist, and inventor. He is known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.

Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla first studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree. He then gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he immigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His AC induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.

Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wirelessly controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.

After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943. Tesla&#x27;s work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the International System of Units (SI) measurement of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor. There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.

==Early years==
Nikola Tesla was born into an ethnic Serb family in the village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire (present-day Croatia), on 10 July 1856. His father, Milutin Tesla (1819–1879), was a priest of the Eastern Orthodox Church. His father&#x27;s brother Josif was a lecturer at a military academy who wrote several textbooks on mathematics.

Tesla&#x27;s mother, Georgina &quot;Đuka&quot; Mandić (1822–1892), whose father was also an Eastern Orthodox priest, had a talent for making home craft tools and mechanical appliances and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems. Đuka had never received a formal education. Tesla credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother&#x27;s genetics and influence.

Tesla was the fourth of five children. He had three sisters, Milka, Angelina, and Marica, and an older brother named Dane, who was killed in a horse-riding accident when Tesla was aged six or seven. In 1861, Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion. In 1862, the Tesla family moved to the nearby town of Gospić, where Tesla&#x27;s father worked as parish priest. Nikola completed primary school, followed by middle school. In 1870, Tesla moved to Karlovac to attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium where the classes were held in German, as it was usual throughout schools within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier. Later in his patent applications, before he obtained American citizenship, Tesla would identify himself as &quot;of Smiljan, Lika, border country of Austria-Hungary&quot;.

Tesla later wrote that he became interested in demonstrations of electricity by his physics professor. Tesla noted that these demonstrations of this &quot;mysterious phenomena&quot; made him want &quot;to know more of this wonderful force&quot;. Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating. He finished a four-year term in three years, graduating in 1873.

After graduating Tesla returned to Smiljan but soon contracted cholera, was bedridden for nine months and was near death multiple times. In a moment of despair, Tesla&#x27;s father (who had originally wanted him to enter the priesthood), promised to send him to the best engineering school if he recovered from the illness. Tesla later said that he had read Mark Twain&#x27;s earlier works while recovering from his illness.

The next year Tesla evaded conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army in Smiljan by running away southeast of Lika to Tomingaj, near Gračac. There he explored the mountains wearing hunter&#x27;s garb. Tesla said that this contact with nature made him stronger, both physically and mentally. He enrolled at the Imperial-Royal Technical College in Graz in 1875 on a Military Frontier scholarship. Tesla passed nine exams (nearly twice as many as required) and received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated, &quot;Your son is a star of first rank.&quot; At Graz, Tesla noted his fascination with the detailed lectures on electricity presented by Professor Jakob Pöschl and described how he made suggestions on improving the design of an electric motor the professor was demonstrating. But by his third year he was failing in school and never graduated, leaving Graz in December 1878. One biographer suggests Tesla was not studying and may have been expelled for gambling and womanizing.

Tesla&#x27;s family did not hear from him after he left school. There was a rumor among his classmates that he had drowned in the nearby river Mur but in January one of them ran into Tesla in the town of Maribor and reported that encounter to Tesla&#x27;s family. It turned out Tesla had been working there as a draftsman for 60 florins per month. In March 1879, Milutin finally located his son and tried to convince him to return home and take up his education in Prague. Tesla returned to Gospić later that month when he was deported for not having a residence permit. Tesla&#x27;s father died the next month, on 17 April 1879, at the age of 60 after an unspecified illness. During the rest of the year Tesla taught a large class of students in his old school in Gospić.

In January 1880, two of Tesla&#x27;s uncles put together enough money to help him leave Gospić for Prague, where he was to study. He arrived too late to enroll at Charles-Ferdinand University; he had never studied Greek, a required subject; and he was illiterate in Czech, another required subject. Tesla did, however, attend lectures in philosophy at the university as an auditor but he did not receive grades for the courses.

=== Working at Budapest Telephone Exchange ===

Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, in 1881 to work under Tivadar Puskás at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, so he worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional, and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position. During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described.

== Working at Edison ==

In 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company. Tesla began working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in large scale electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors. They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.

=== Moving to the United States ===
In 1884, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who had been overseeing the Paris installation, was brought back to the United States to manage the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City, and asked that Tesla be brought to the United States as well. In June 1884, Tesla emigrated and began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side, an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 &quot;field engineers&quot; struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in that city. As in Paris, Tesla was working on troubleshooting installations and improving generators. Historian W. Bernard Carlson notes Tesla may have met company founder Thomas Edison only a couple of times. One of those times was noted in Tesla&#x27;s autobiography where, after staying up all night repairing the damaged dynamos on the ocean liner , he ran into Batchelor and Edison, who made a quip about their &quot;Parisian&quot; being out all night. After Tesla told them he had been up all night fixing the &quot;Oregon&quot;, Edison commented to Batchelor that &quot;this is a damned good man&quot;. One of the projects given to Tesla was to develop an arc lamp-based street lighting system. Arc lighting was the most popular type of street lighting but it required high voltages and was incompatible with the Edison low-voltage incandescent system, causing the company to lose contracts in some cities. Tesla&#x27;s designs were never put into production, possibly because of technical improvements in incandescent street lighting or because of an installation deal that Edison made with an arc lighting company.

Tesla had been working at the Machine Works for a total of six months when he quit. What event precipitated his leaving is unclear. It may have been over a bonus he did not receive, either for redesigning generators or for the arc lighting system that was shelved. Tesla had previous run-ins with the Edison company over unpaid bonuses he believed he had earned. In his autobiography, Tesla stated the manager of the Edison Machine Works offered a $50,000 bonus to design &quot;twenty-four different types of standard machines&quot; &quot;but it turned out to be a practical joke&quot;. Later versions of this story have Thomas Edison himself offering and then reneging on the deal, quipping &quot;Tesla, you don&#x27;t understand our American humor&quot;. The size of the bonus in either story has been noted as odd since Machine Works manager Batchelor was stingy with pay and the company did not have that amount of cash (equal to $ today) on hand. Tesla&#x27;s diary contains just one comment on what happened at the end of his employment, a note he scrawled across the two pages covering 7 December 1884, to 4 January 1885, saying &quot;Good By to the Edison Machine Works&quot;.

== Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing ==
Soon after leaving the Edison company, Tesla was working on patenting an arc lighting system, possibly the same one he had developed at Edison. In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents. Serrell introduced Tesla to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla&#x27;s name, the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company. Tesla worked for the rest of the year obtaining the patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system in Rahway, New Jersey. Tesla&#x27;s new system gained notice in the technical press, which commented on its advanced features.

The investors showed little interest in Tesla&#x27;s ideas for new types of alternating current motors and electrical transmission equipment. After the utility was up and running in 1886, they decided that the manufacturing side of the business was too competitive and opted to simply run an electric utility. They formed a new utility company, abandoning Tesla&#x27;s company and leaving the inventor penniless. Tesla even lost control of the patents he had generated, since he had assigned them to the company in exchange for stock. He had to work at various electrical repair jobs and as a ditch digger for $2 per day. Later in life Tesla recounted that part of 1886 as a time of hardship, writing &quot;My high education in various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed to me like a mockery&quot;.

== AC and the induction motor ==
In late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck. The two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain. Based on Tesla&#x27;s new ideas for electrical equipment, including a thermo-magnetic motor idea, they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents. Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887, with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go to Tesla, to Peck and Brown, and to fund development. They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, generators, and other devices.

In 1887, Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current (AC), a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States because of its advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.

Along with getting the motor patented, Peck and Brown arranged to get the motor publicized, starting with independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrently with the issue of the patent. Physicist William Arnold Anthony (who tested the motor) and &quot;Electrical World&quot; magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his AC motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system—something Westinghouse needed for the alternating current system he was already marketing. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla&#x27;s patent would probably control the market.

In July 1888, Brown and Peck negotiated a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for Tesla&#x27;s polyphase induction motor and transformer designs for $60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor. Westinghouse also hired Tesla for one year for the large fee of $2,000 ($ in today&#x27;s dollars) per month to be a consultant at the Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company&#x27;s Pittsburgh labs.

During that year, Tesla worked in Pittsburgh, helping to create an alternating current system to power the city&#x27;s streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla&#x27;s motor), but they soon found that it would not work for streetcars, since Tesla&#x27;s induction motor could run only at a constant speed. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.

=== Market turmoil ===
Tesla&#x27;s demonstration of his induction motor and Westinghouse&#x27;s subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888, came at the time of extreme competition between electric companies. The three big firms, Westinghouse, Edison, and Thomson-Houston Electric Company, were trying to grow in a capital-intensive business while financially undercutting each other. There was even a &quot;war of currents&quot; propaganda campaign going on, with Edison Electric claiming their direct current system was better and safer than the Westinghouse alternating current system and Thomson-Houston sometimes siding with Edison. Competing in this market meant Westinghouse would not have the cash or engineering resources to develop Tesla&#x27;s motor and the related polyphase system right away.

Two years after signing the Tesla contract, Westinghouse Electric was in trouble. The near collapse of Barings Bank in London triggered the financial panic of 1890, causing investors to call in their loans to Westinghouse Electric. The sudden cash shortage forced the company to refinance its debts. The new lenders demanded that Westinghouse cut back on what looked like excessive spending on acquisition of other companies, research, and patents, including the per motor royalty in the Tesla contract. At that point, the Tesla induction motor had been unsuccessful and was stuck in development. Westinghouse was paying a $15,000-a-year guaranteed royalty even though operating examples of the motor were rare and polyphase power systems needed to run it were even rarer. In early 1891, George Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that, if he did not meet the demands of his lenders, he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to &quot;deal with the bankers&quot; to try to collect future royalties. The advantages of having Westinghouse continue to champion the motor probably seemed obvious to Tesla and he agreed to release the company from the royalty payment clause in the contract. Six years later Westinghouse purchased Tesla&#x27;s patent for a lump sum payment of $216,000 as part of a patent-sharing agreement signed with General Electric (a company created from the 1892 merger of Edison and Thomson-Houston).

== New York laboratories ==
The money Tesla made from licensing his AC patents made him independently wealthy and gave him the time and funds to pursue his own interests. In 1889, Tesla moved out of the Liberty Street shop Peck and Brown had rented and for the next dozen years worked out of a series of workshop/laboratory spaces in Manhattan. These included a lab at 175 Grand Street (1889–1892), the fourth floor of 33–35 South Fifth Avenue (1892–1895), and sixth and seventh floors of 46 &amp; 48 East Houston Street (1895–1902). Tesla and his hired staff conducted some of his most significant work in these workshops.

=== Tesla coil ===
In the summer of 1889, Tesla traveled to the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris and learned of Heinrich Hertz&#x27;s 1886–1888 experiments that proved the existence of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves. In repeating and then expanding on these experiments Tesla tried powering a Ruhmkorff coil with a high speed alternator he had been developing as part of an improved arc lighting system but found that the high-frequency current overheated the iron core and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings in the coil. To fix this problem Tesla came up with his &quot;oscillating transformer&quot;, with an air gap instead of insulating material between the primary and secondary windings and an iron core that could be moved to different positions in or out of the coil. Later called the Tesla coil, it would be used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity. He would use this resonant transformer circuit in his later wireless power work.

=== Citizenship ===
On 30 July 1891, aged 35, Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In the same year, he patented his Tesla coil.

=== Wireless lighting ===

After 1890, Tesla experimented with transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling using high AC voltages generated with his Tesla coil. He attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near-field inductive and capacitive coupling and conducted a series of public demonstrations where he lit Geissler tubes and even incandescent light bulbs from across a stage. He spent most of the decade working on variations of this new form of lighting with the help of various investors but none of the ventures succeeded in making a commercial product out of his findings.

In 1893 at St. Louis, Missouri, the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the National Electric Light Association, Tesla told onlookers that he was sure a system like his could eventually conduct &quot;intelligible signals or perhaps even power to any distance without the use of wires&quot; by conducting it through the Earth.

Tesla served as a vice-president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers from 1892 to 1894, the forerunner of the modern-day IEEE (along with the Institute of Radio Engineers).

=== Polyphase system and the Columbian Exposition ===

By the beginning of 1893, Westinghouse engineer Charles F. Scott and then Benjamin G. Lamme had made progress on an efficient version of Tesla&#x27;s induction motor. Lamme found a way to make the polyphase system it would need compatible with older single-phase AC and DC systems by developing a rotary converter. Westinghouse Electric now had a way to provide electricity to all potential customers and started branding their polyphase AC system as the &quot;Tesla Polyphase System&quot;. They believed that Tesla&#x27;s patents gave them patent priority over other polyphase AC systems.

Westinghouse Electric asked Tesla to participate in the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago where the company had a large space in the &quot;Electricity Building&quot; devoted to electrical exhibits. Westinghouse Electric won the bid to light the Exposition with alternating current and it was a key event in the history of AC power, as the company demonstrated to the American public the safety, reliability, and efficiency of an alternating current system that was polyphase and could also supply the other AC and DC exhibits at the fair.

A special exhibit space was set up to display various forms and models of Tesla&#x27;s induction motor. The rotating magnetic field that drove them was explained through a series of demonstrations including an &quot;Egg of Columbus&quot; that used the two-phase coil found in an induction motor to spin a copper egg making it stand on end.

Tesla visited the fair for a week during its six-month run to attend the International Electrical Congress and put on a series of demonstrations at the Westinghouse exhibit. A specially darkened room had been set up where Tesla showed his wireless lighting system, using a demonstration he had previously performed throughout America and Europe; these included using high-voltage, high-frequency alternating current to light wireless gas-discharge lamps.

An observer noted:

=== Steam-powered oscillating generator ===
During his presentation at the International Electrical Congress in the Columbian Exposition Agriculture Hall, Tesla introduced his steam-powered reciprocating electricity generator that he patented that year, something he thought was a better way to generate alternating current. Steam was forced into the oscillator and rushed out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature. The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.

=== Consulting on Niagara ===

In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, who headed the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla&#x27;s opinion on what system would be best to transmit power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to do it. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams asked Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla&#x27;s advice and Westinghouse&#x27;s demonstration at the Columbian Exposition. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.

=== The Nikola Tesla Company ===
In 1895, Edward Dean Adams, impressed with what he saw when he toured Tesla&#x27;s lab, agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions as well as new ones. Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney. It found few investors since the mid-1890s were a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out. The company handled Tesla&#x27;s patents for decades to come.

=== Lab fire ===

In the early morning hours of 13 March 1895, the South Fifth Avenue building that housed Tesla&#x27;s lab caught fire. It started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla&#x27;s 4th-floor lab burned and collapsed into the second floor. The fire not only set back Tesla&#x27;s ongoing projects, but it also destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition. Tesla told &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;I am in too much grief to talk. What can I say?&quot;. After the fire Tesla moved to 46 &amp; 48 East Houston Street and rebuilt his lab on the 6th and 7th floors.

=== X-ray experimentation ===
Starting in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of &quot;invisible&quot; kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments (later identified as &quot;Roentgen rays&quot; or &quot;X-rays&quot;). His early experiments were with Crookes tubes, a cold cathode electrical discharge tube. Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X-ray image—predating, by a few weeks, Wilhelm Röntgen&#x27;s December 1895 announcement of the discovery of X-rays—when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge tube. The only thing captured in the image was the metal locking screw on the camera lens.

In March 1896, after hearing of Röntgen&#x27;s discovery of X-ray and X-ray imaging (radiography), Tesla proceeded to do his own experiments in X-ray imaging, developing a high-energy single-terminal vacuum tube of his own design that had no target electrode and that worked from the output of the Tesla coil (the modern term for the phenomenon produced by this device is &quot;bremsstrahlung&quot; or &quot;braking radiation&quot;). In his research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce X-rays. Tesla held that, with his circuits, the &quot;instrument will ... enable one to generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus&quot;.

Tesla noted the hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In his many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the ozone generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas. These plasma waves can occur in force-free magnetic fields.

On 11 July 1934, the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; published an article on Tesla, in which he recalled an event that occasionally took place while experimenting with his single-electrode vacuum tubes. A minute particle would break off the cathode, pass out of the tube, and physically strike him:

Tesla said he could feel a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body, and again at the place where it passed out. In comparing these particles with the bits of metal projected by his &quot;electric gun&quot;, Tesla said, &quot;The particles in the beam of force ... will travel much faster than such particles ... and they will travel in concentrations&quot;.
=== Radio remote control ===

In 1898, Tesla demonstrated a boat that used a coherer-based radio control—which he dubbed &quot;telautomaton&quot;—to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden. Tesla tried to sell his idea to the US military as a type of radio-controlled torpedo, but they showed little interest. Remote radio control remained a novelty until World War I and afterward, when a number of countries used it in military programs. Tesla took the opportunity to further demonstrate &quot;Teleautomatics&quot; in an address to a meeting of the Commercial Club in Chicago, while he was traveling to Colorado Springs, on 13 May 1899.

== Wireless power ==

From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a great deal of his time and fortune on a series of projects trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power that he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He saw this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.

At the time Tesla was formulating his ideas, there was no feasible way to wirelessly transmit communication signals over long distances, let alone large amounts of power. Tesla had studied radio waves early on, and came to the conclusion that part of the existing study on them, by Hertz, was incorrect. Also, this new form of radiation was widely considered at the time to be a short-distance phenomenon that seemed to die out in less than a mile. Tesla noted that, even if theories on radio waves were true, they were totally worthless for his intended purposes since this form of &quot;invisible light&quot; would diminish over a distance just like any other radiation and would travel in straight lines right out into space, becoming &quot;hopelessly lost&quot;.

By the mid-1890s, Tesla was working on the idea that he might be able to conduct electricity long distance through the Earth or the atmosphere, and began working on experiments to test this idea including setting up a large resonance transformer magnifying transmitter in his East Houston Street lab. Seeming to borrow from a common idea at the time that the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere was conductive, he proposed a system composed of balloons suspending, transmitting, and receiving, electrodes in the air above in altitude, where he thought the lower pressure would allow him to send high voltages (millions of volts) long distances.

=== Colorado Springs ===

To further study the conductive nature of low-pressure air, Tesla set up an experimental station at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899. There he could safely operate much larger coils than in the cramped confines of his New York lab, and an associate had made an arrangement for the El Paso Electric Light Company to supply alternating current free of charge. To fund his experiments, he convinced John Jacob Astor IV to invest $100,000 ($ in today&#x27;s dollars) to become a majority shareholder in the Nikola Tesla Company. Astor thought he was primarily investing in the new wireless lighting system. Instead, Tesla used the money to fund his Colorado Springs experiments. Upon his arrival, he told reporters that he planned to conduct wireless telegraphy experiments, transmitting signals from Pikes Peak to Paris.

There, he conducted experiments with a large coil operating in the megavolts range, producing artificial lightning (and thunder) consisting of millions of volts and discharges of up to in length, and, at one point, inadvertently burned out the generator in El Paso, causing a power outage. The observations he made of the electronic noise of lightning strikes led him to (incorrectly) conclude that he could use the entire globe of the Earth to conduct electrical energy.

During his time at his laboratory, Tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver which he speculated to be communications from another planet. He mentioned them in a letter to a reporter in December 1899 and to the Red Cross Society in December 1900. Reporters treated it as a sensational story and jumped to the conclusion Tesla was hearing signals from Mars. He expanded on the signals he heard in a 9 February 1901 &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; article entitled &quot;Talking With Planets&quot;, where he said it had not been immediately apparent to him that he was hearing &quot;intelligently controlled signals&quot; and that the signals could have come from Mars, Venus, or other planets. It has been hypothesized that he may have intercepted Guglielmo Marconi&#x27;s European experiments in July 1899—Marconi may have transmitted the letter S (dot/dot/dot) in a naval demonstration, the same three impulses that Tesla hinted at hearing in Colorado—or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission.

Tesla had an agreement with the editor of &quot;The Century Magazine&quot; to produce an article on his findings. The magazine sent a photographer to Colorado to photograph the work being done there. The article, titled &quot;The Problem of Increasing Human Energy&quot;, appeared in the June 1900 edition of the magazine. He explained the superiority of the wireless system he envisioned but the article was more of a lengthy philosophical treatise than an understandable scientific description of his work, illustrated with what were to become iconic images of Tesla and his Colorado Springs experiments.

=== Wardenclyffe ===

Tesla made the rounds in New York trying to find investors for what he thought would be a viable system of wireless transmission, wining and dining them at the Waldorf-Astoria&#x27;s Palm Garden (the hotel where he was living at the time), The Players Club, and Delmonico&#x27;s. In March 1901, he obtained $150,000 ($ in today&#x27;s dollars) from J. P. Morgan in return for a 51% share of any generated wireless patents, and began planning the Wardenclyffe Tower facility to be built in Shoreham, New York, east of the city on the North Shore of Long Island.

By July 1901, Tesla had expanded his plans to build a more powerful transmitter to leap ahead of Marconi&#x27;s radio-based system, which Tesla thought was a copy of his own. He approached Morgan to ask for more money to build the larger system, but Morgan refused to supply any further funds. In December 1901, Marconi successfully transmitted the letter S from England to Newfoundland, defeating Tesla in the race to be first to complete such a transmission. A month after Marconi&#x27;s success, Tesla tried to get Morgan to back an even larger plan to transmit messages and power by controlling &quot;vibrations throughout the globe&quot;. Over the next five years, Tesla wrote more than 50 letters to Morgan, pleading for and demanding additional funding to complete the construction of Wardenclyffe. Tesla continued the project for another nine months into 1902. The tower was erected to its full height of . In June 1902, Tesla moved his lab operations from Houston Street to Wardenclyffe.

Investors on Wall Street were putting their money into Marconi&#x27;s system, and some in the press began turning against Tesla&#x27;s project, claiming it was a hoax. The project came to a halt in 1905, and in 1906, the financial problems and other events may have led to what Tesla biographer Marc J. Seifer suspects was a nervous breakdown on Tesla&#x27;s part. Tesla mortgaged the Wardenclyffe property to cover his debts at the Waldorf-Astoria, which eventually amounted to $20,000 ($ in today&#x27;s dollars). He lost the property in foreclosure in 1915, and in 1917 the Tower was demolished by the new owner to make the land a more viable real estate asset.

== Later years ==

After Wardenclyffe closed, Tesla continued to write to Morgan; after &quot;the great man&quot; died, Tesla wrote to Morgan&#x27;s son Jack, trying to get further funding for the project. In 1906, Tesla opened offices at 165 Broadway in Manhattan, trying to raise further funds by developing and marketing his patents. He went on to have offices at the Metropolitan Life Tower from 1910 to 1914; rented for a few months at the Woolworth Building, moving out because he could not afford the rent; and then to office space at 8 West 40th Street from 1915 to 1925. After moving to 8 West 40th Street, he was effectively bankrupt. Most of his patents had run out and he was having trouble with the new inventions he was trying to develop.

=== Bladeless turbine ===

On his 50th birthday, in 1906, Tesla demonstrated a 16,000 rpm bladeless turbine. During 1910–1911, at the Waterside Power Station in New York, several of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100–5,000 hp. Tesla worked with several companies including from 1919 to 1922 in Milwaukee, for Allis-Chalmers. He spent most of his time trying to perfect the Tesla turbine with Hans Dahlstrand, the head engineer at the company, but engineering difficulties meant it was never made into a practical device. Tesla did license the idea to a precision instrument company and it found use in the form of luxury car speedometers and other instruments.

=== Wireless lawsuits ===

When World War I broke out, the British cut the transatlantic telegraph cable linking the US to Germany in order to control the flow of information between the two countries. They also tried to shut off German wireless communication to and from the US by having the US Marconi Company sue the German radio company Telefunken for patent infringement. Telefunken brought in the physicists Jonathan Zenneck and Karl Ferdinand Braun for their defense, and hired Tesla as a witness for two years for $1,000 a month. The case stalled and then went moot when the US entered the war against Germany in 1917.

In 1915, Tesla attempted to sue the Marconi Company for infringement of his wireless tuning patents. Marconi&#x27;s initial radio patent had been awarded in the US in 1897, but his 1900 patent submission covering improvements to radio transmission had been rejected several times, before it was finally approved in 1904, on the grounds that it infringed on other existing patents including two 1897 Tesla wireless power tuning patents. Tesla&#x27;s 1915 case went nowhere, but in a related case, where the Marconi Company tried to sue the US government over WWI patent infringements, a Supreme Court of the United States 1943 decision restored the prior patents of Oliver Lodge, John Stone, and Tesla. The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi&#x27;s claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi&#x27;s claim to certain patented improvements were questionable, the company could not claim infringement on those same patents.

=== Nobel Prize rumors ===

On 6 November 1915, a Reuters news agency report from London had the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla; however, on 15 November, a Reuters story from Stockholm stated the prize that year was being awarded to William Henry Bragg and Lawrence Bragg &quot;for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays&quot;. There were unsubstantiated rumors at the time that either Tesla or Edison had refused the prize. The Nobel Foundation said, &quot;Any rumor that a person has not been given a Nobel Prize because he has made known his intention to refuse the reward is ridiculous&quot;; a recipient could decline a Nobel Prize only after he is announced a winner.

There have been subsequent claims by Tesla biographers that Edison and Tesla were the original recipients and that neither was given the award because of their animosity toward each other; that each sought to minimize the other&#x27;s achievements and right to win the award; that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first; that both rejected any possibility of sharing it; and even that a wealthy Edison refused it to keep Tesla from getting the $20,000 prize money.

In the years after these rumors, neither Tesla nor Edison won a Nobel prize (although Edison received one of 38 possible bids in 1915 and Tesla received one of 38 possible bids in 1937).

=== Other awards, patents and ideas ===
Tesla won numerous medals and awards over this time. They include:

* Grand Officer of the Order of St. Sava (Serbia, 1892)
* Elliott Cresson Medal (Franklin Institute, US, 1894)
* Grand Cross of the Order of Prince Danilo I (Montenegro, 1895)
* Member of the American Philosophical Society (US, 1896)
* AIEE Edison Medal (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, US, 1916)
* Grand Cross of the Order of St. Sava (Yugoslavia, 1926)
* Cross of the Order of the Yugoslav Crown (Yugoslavia, 1931)
* John Scott Medal (Franklin Institute &amp; Philadelphia City Council, US, 1934)
* Order of the White Eagle (Yugoslavia, 1936)
* Grand Cross of the Order of the White Lion (Czechoslovakia, 1937)
* Medal of the University of Paris (Paris, France, 1937)
* The Medal of the University St. Clement of Ochrida (Sofia, Bulgaria, 1939)

Tesla attempted to market several devices based on the production of ozone. These included his 1900 Tesla Ozone Company selling an 1896 patented device based on his Tesla coil, used to bubble ozone through different types of oils to make a therapeutic gel. He also tried to develop a variation of this a few years later as a room sanitizer for hospitals.

Tesla theorized that the application of electricity to the brain enhanced intelligence. In 1912, he crafted &quot;a plan to make dull students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity,&quot; wiring the walls of a schoolroom and, &quot;saturating [the schoolroom] with infinitesimal electric waves vibrating at high frequency. The whole room will thus, Mr. Tesla claims, be converted into a health-giving and stimulating electromagnetic field or &#x27;bath.&quot; The plan was, at least provisionally, approved by then superintendent of New York City schools, William H. Maxwell.

Before World War I, Tesla sought overseas investors. After the war started, Tesla lost the funding he was receiving from his patents in European countries.

In the August 1917 edition of the magazine &quot;Electrical Experimenter&quot;, Tesla postulated that electricity could be used to locate submarines via using the reflection of an &quot;electric ray&quot; of &quot;tremendous frequency,&quot; with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen (a system that has been noted to have a superficial resemblance to modern radar). Tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high-frequency radio waves would penetrate water. Émile Girardeau, who helped develop France&#x27;s first radar system in the 1930s, noted in 1953 that Tesla&#x27;s general speculation that a very strong high-frequency signal would be needed was correct. Girardeau said, &quot;(Tesla) was prophesying or dreaming, since he had at his disposal no means of carrying them out, but one must add that if he was dreaming, at least he was dreaming correctly&quot;.

In 1928, Tesla received patent, , for a biplane design capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), which &quot;gradually tilted through manipulation of the elevator devices&quot; in flight until it was flying like a conventional plane. This impractical design was something Tesla thought would sell for less than $1,000.

Tesla had a further office at 350 Madison Ave but by 1928 he no longer had a laboratory or funding.

=== Living circumstances ===
Tesla lived at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City from 1900 and ran up a large bill. He moved to the St. Regis Hotel in 1922 and followed a pattern from then on of moving to a different hotel every few years and leaving unpaid bills behind.

Tesla walked to the park every day to feed the pigeons. He began feeding them at the window of his hotel room and nursed injured birds back to health. He said that he had been visited by a certain injured white pigeon daily. He spent over $2,000 () to care for the bird, including a device he built to support her comfortably while her broken wing and leg healed. Tesla stated:

Tesla&#x27;s unpaid bills, as well as complaints about the mess made by pigeons, led to his eviction from St. Regis in 1923. He was also forced to leave the Hotel Pennsylvania in 1930 and the Hotel Governor Clinton in 1934. At one point he also took rooms at the Hotel Marguery.

Tesla moved to the Hotel New Yorker in 1934. At this time Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company began paying him $125 () per month in addition to paying his rent. Accounts of how this came about vary. Several sources claim that Westinghouse was concerned, or possibly warned, about potential bad publicity arising from the impoverished conditions in which their former star inventor was living. The payment has been described as being couched as a &quot;consulting fee&quot; to get around Tesla&#x27;s aversion to accepting charity. Tesla biographer Marc Seifer described the Westinghouse payments as a type of &quot;unspecified settlement&quot;.

=== Birthday press conferences ===

In 1931, a young journalist whom Tesla befriended, Kenneth M. Swezey, organized a celebration for the inventor&#x27;s 75th birthday. Tesla received congratulations from figures in science and engineering such as Albert Einstein, and he was also featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. The cover caption &quot;All the world&#x27;s his power house&quot; noted his contribution to electrical power generation. The party went so well that Tesla made it an annual event, an occasion where he would put out a large spread of food and drink—featuring dishes of his own creation. He invited the press in order to see his inventions and hear stories about his past exploits, views on current events, and sometimes baffling claims.
At the 1932 party, Tesla claimed he had invented a motor that would run on cosmic rays.
In 1933, at age 77, Tesla told reporters at the event that, after 35 years of work, he was on the verge of producing proof of a new form of energy. He claimed it was a theory of energy that was &quot;violently opposed&quot; to Einsteinian physics and could be tapped with an apparatus that would be cheap to run and last 500 years. He also told reporters he was working on a way to transmit individualized private radio wavelengths, working on breakthroughs in metallurgy, and developing a way to photograph the retina to record thought.

At the 1934 occasion, Tesla told reporters he had designed a superweapon he claimed would end all war. He called it &quot;teleforce&quot;, but was usually referred to as his death ray. In 1940, the &quot;New York Times&quot; gave a range for the ray of , with an expected development cost of US$2 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Tesla described it as a defensive weapon that would be put up along the border of a country and be used against attacking ground-based infantry or aircraft. Tesla never revealed detailed plans of how the weapon worked during his lifetime but, in 1984, they surfaced at the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade. The treatise, &quot;The New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media&quot;, described an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging slugs of tungsten or mercury to millions of volts, and directing them in streams (through electrostatic repulsion). Tesla tried to attract interest of the US War Department, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device.

In 1935, at his 79th birthday party, Tesla covered many topics. He claimed to have discovered the cosmic ray in 1896 and invented a way to produce direct current by induction, and made many claims about his mechanical oscillator. Describing the device (which he expected would earn him $100 million within two years) he told reporters that a version of his oscillator had caused an earthquake in his 46 East Houston Street lab and neighboring streets in Lower Manhattan in 1898. He went on to tell reporters his oscillator could destroy the Empire State Building with of air pressure. He also proposed using his oscillators to transmit vibrations into the ground. He claimed it would work over any distance and could be used for communication or locating underground mineral deposits, a technique he called &quot;telegeodynamics&quot;.

In 1937, at his Grand Ballroom of Hotel New Yorker event, Tesla received the Order of the White Lion from the Czechoslovak ambassador and a medal from the Yugoslav ambassador. On questions concerning the death ray, Tesla stated: &quot;But it is not an experiment ... I have built, demonstrated and used it. Only a little time will pass before I can give it to the world.&quot;

== Death ==

In the fall of 1937 at the age of 81, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and library to feed the pigeons. While crossing a street a couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was struck by a moving taxicab and was thrown to the ground. His back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident. The full extent of his injuries was never known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered.

On 7 January 1943, at the age of 86, Tesla died alone in Room 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker. His body was found by maid Alice Monaghan when she entered Tesla&#x27;s room, ignoring the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign that Tesla had placed on his door two days earlier. Assistant medical examiner H.W. Wembley examined the body and ruled that the cause of death had been coronary thrombosis (a type of heart attack).

Two days later the Federal Bureau of Investigation ordered the Alien Property Custodian to seize Tesla&#x27;s belongings. John G. Trump, a professor at M.I.T. and a well-known electrical engineer serving as a technical aide to the National Defense Research Committee, was called in to analyze the Tesla items. After a three-day investigation, Trump&#x27;s report concluded that there was nothing which would constitute a hazard in unfriendly hands, stating:

In a box purported to contain a part of Tesla&#x27;s &quot;death ray&quot;, Trump found a 45-year-old multidecade resistance box.

On 10 January 1943, New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia read a eulogy written by Slovene-American author Louis Adamic live over WNYC radio while violin pieces &quot;Ave Maria&quot; and &quot;Tamo daleko&quot; were played in the background. On 12 January, two thousand people attended a state funeral for Tesla at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. After the funeral, Tesla&#x27;s body was taken to the Ferncliff Cemetery in Ardsley, New York, where it was later cremated. The following day, a second service was conducted by prominent priests in the Trinity Chapel (today&#x27;s Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sava) in New York City.

== Personal life and character ==

Tesla was a lifelong bachelor, who had once explained that his chastity was very helpful to his scientific abilities. In an interview with the &quot;Galveston Daily News&quot; on 10 August 1924 he stated, &quot;Now the soft-voiced gentlewoman of my reverent worship has all but vanished. In her place has come the woman who thinks that her chief success in life lies in making herself as much as possible like man—in dress, voice and actions...&quot; Although he told a reporter in later years that he sometimes felt that by not marrying, he had made too great a sacrifice to his work, Tesla chose to never pursue or engage in any known relationships, instead finding all the stimulation he needed in his work.

Tesla was asocial and prone to seclude himself with his work. However, when he did engage in social life, many people spoke very positively and admiringly of Tesla. Robert Underwood Johnson described him as attaining a &quot;distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement, generosity, and force&quot;. His secretary, Dorothy Skerrit, wrote: &quot;his genial smile and nobility of bearing always denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in his soul&quot;. Tesla&#x27;s friend, Julian Hawthorne, wrote, &quot;seldom did one meet a scientist or engineer who was also a poet, a philosopher, an appreciator of fine music, a linguist, and a connoisseur of food and drink&quot;.

Tesla was a good friend of Francis Marion Crawford, Robert Underwood Johnson, Stanford White, Fritz Lowenstein, George Scherff, and Kenneth Swezey. In middle age, Tesla became a close friend of Mark Twain; they spent a lot of time together in his lab and elsewhere. Twain notably described Tesla&#x27;s induction motor invention as &quot;the most valuable patent since the telephone&quot;. At a party thrown by actress Sarah Bernhardt in 1896, Tesla met Indian Hindu monk Swami Vivekananda. Vivekananda later wrote that Tesla said he could demonstrate mathematically the relationship between matter and energy, something Vivekananda hoped would give a scientific foundation to Vedantic cosmology. The meeting with Swami Vivekananda stimulated Tesla&#x27;s interest in Eastern Science, which led to Tesla studying Hindu and Vedic philosophy for a number of years. Tesla later wrote an article titled &quot;Man&#x27;s Greatest Achievement&quot; using Sanskrit terms akasha and prana to describe the relationship between matter and energy. In the late 1920s, Tesla befriended George Sylvester Viereck, a poet, writer, mystic, and later, a Nazi propagandist. Tesla occasionally attended dinner parties held by Viereck and his wife.

Tesla could be harsh at times and openly expressed disgust for overweight people, such as when he fired a secretary because of her weight. He was quick to criticize clothing; on several occasions, Tesla directed a subordinate to go home and change her dress. When Thomas Edison died in 1931, Tesla contributed the only negative opinion to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, buried in an extensive coverage of Edison&#x27;s life:

Tesla became a vegetarian in his later years, living on only milk, bread, honey, and vegetable juices.

== Views and beliefs ==

=== On experimental and theoretical physics ===
Tesla disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller subatomic particles, stating there was no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge. He believed that if electrons existed at all, they were some fourth state of matter or &quot;sub-atom&quot; that could exist only in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity. Tesla believed that atoms are immutable—they could not change state or be split in any way. He was a believer in the 19th-century concept of an all-pervasive ether that transmitted electrical energy.

Tesla was generally antagonistic towards theories about the conversion of matter into energy. He was also critical of Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity, saying:

In 1935 he described relativity as &quot;a beggar wrapped in purple whom ignorant people take for a king&quot; and said his own experiments had measured the speed of cosmic rays from Arcturus as fifty times the speed of light.

Tesla claimed to have developed his own physical principle regarding matter and energy that he started working on in 1892, and in 1937, at age 81, claimed in a letter to have completed a &quot;dynamic theory of gravity&quot; that &quot;[would] put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space&quot;. He stated that the theory was &quot;worked out in all details&quot; and that he hoped to soon give it to the world. Further elucidation of his theory was never found in his writings.

=== On society ===

Tesla is widely considered by his biographers to have been a humanist in philosophical outlook. This did not preclude Tesla, like many of his era, from becoming a proponent of an imposed selective breeding version of eugenics.

Tesla expressed the belief that human &quot;pity&quot; had come to interfere with the natural &quot;ruthless workings of nature&quot;. Though his argumentation did not depend on a concept of a &quot;master race&quot; or the inherent superiority of one person over another, he advocated for eugenics. In a 1937 interview he stated:

In 1926, Tesla commented on the ills of the social subservience of women and the struggle of women toward gender equality, and indicated that humanity&#x27;s future would be run by &quot;Queen Bees&quot;. He believed that women would become the dominant sex in the future.

Tesla made predictions about the relevant issues of a post-World War I environment in a printed article entitled &quot;Science and Discovery are the great Forces which will lead to the Consummation of the War&quot; (20 December 1914). Tesla believed that the League of Nations was not a remedy for the times and issues.

=== On religion ===
Tesla was raised an Orthodox Christian. Later in life he did not consider himself to be a &quot;believer in the orthodox sense&quot;, said he opposed religious fanaticism, and said &quot;Buddhism and Christianity are the greatest religions both in number of disciples and in importance.&quot; He also said &quot;To me, the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end&quot; and &quot;what we call &#x27;soul&#x27; or &#x27;spirit,&#x27; is nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body. When this functioning ceases, the &#x27;soul&#x27; or the &#x27;spirit&#x27; ceases likewise.&quot;

== Literary works ==
Tesla wrote a number of books and articles for magazines and journals. Among his books are &quot;My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla&quot;, compiled and edited by Ben Johnston in 1983 from a series of 1919 magazine articles by Tesla which were republished in 1977; &quot;The Fantastic Inventions of Nikola Tesla&quot; (1993), compiled and edited by David Hatcher Childress; and &quot;The Tesla Papers&quot;.

Many of Tesla&#x27;s writings are freely available online, including the article &quot;The Problem of Increasing Human Energy&quot;, published in &quot;The Century Magazine&quot; in 1900, and the article &quot;Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency&quot;, published in his book &quot;Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla&quot;.

== Legacy and honors ==
In 1952, following pressure from Tesla&#x27;s nephew, influential Yugoslav politician , Tesla&#x27;s entire estate was shipped to Belgrade in 80 trunks marked N.T. In 1957, Kosanović&#x27;s secretary Charlotte Muzar transported Tesla&#x27;s ashes from the United States to Belgrade. The ashes are displayed in a gold-plated sphere on a marble pedestal in the Nikola Tesla Museum. Nikola Tesla&#x27;s Archive consists of over 160,000 original documents and is included in UNESCO Memory of the World Programme.

Tesla obtained around 300 patents worldwide for his inventions. Some of Tesla&#x27;s patents are not accounted for, and various sources have discovered some that have lain hidden in patent archives. There are a minimum of 278 known patents issued to Tesla in 26 countries. Many of Tesla&#x27;s patents were in the United States, Britain, and Canada, but many other patents were approved in countries around the globe. Many inventions developed by Tesla were not put into patent protection.

<text>In mathematics, the natural numbers are the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on, possibly excluding 0. Some start counting with 0, defining the natural numbers as the non-negative integers , while others start with 1, defining them as the positive integers Some authors acknowledge both definitions whenever convenient. Sometimes, the whole numbers are the natural numbers plus zero. In other cases, the &quot;whole numbers&quot; refer to all of the integers, including negative integers. The counting numbers are another term for the natural numbers, particularly in primary school education, and are ambiguous as well although typically start at 1.

The natural numbers are used for counting things, like &quot;there are &quot;six&quot; coins on the table&quot;, in which case they are called &quot;cardinal numbers&quot;. They are also used to put things in order, like &quot;this is the &quot;third&quot; largest city in the country&quot;, which are called &quot;ordinal numbers&quot;. Natural numbers are also used as labels, like jersey numbers on a sports team, where they serve as &quot;nominal numbers&quot; and do not have mathematical properties.

The natural numbers form a set, commonly symbolized as a bold or blackboard bold . Many other number sets are built from the natural numbers. For example, the integers are made by adding 0 and negative numbers. The rational numbers add fractions, and the real numbers add infinite decimals. Complex numbers add the square root of. This chain of extensions canonically embeds the natural numbers in the other number systems.

Natural numbers are studied in different areas of math. Number theory looks at things like how numbers divide evenly (divisibility), or how prime numbers are spread out. Combinatorics studies counting and arranging numbered objects, such as partitions and enumerations.

==History==
===Ancient roots===


The most primitive method of representing a natural number is to use one&#x27;s fingers, as in finger counting. Putting down a tally mark for each object is another primitive method. Later, a set of objects could be tested for equality, excess or shortage—by striking out a mark and removing an object from the set.

The first major advance in abstraction was the use of numerals to represent numbers. This allowed systems to be developed for recording large numbers. The ancient Egyptians developed a powerful system of numerals with distinct hieroglyphs for 1, 10, and all powers of 10 up to over 1 million. A stone carving from Karnak, dating back from around 1500 BCE and now at the Louvre in Paris, depicts 276 as 2 hundreds, 7 tens, and 6 ones; and similarly for the number 4,622. The Babylonians had a place-value system based essentially on the numerals for 1 and 10, using base sixty, so that the symbol for sixty was the same as the symbol for one—its value being determined from context.

A much later advance was the development of the idea that  can be considered as a number, with its own numeral. The use of a 0 digit in place-value notation (within other numbers) dates back as early as 700 BCE by the Babylonians, who omitted such a digit when it would have been the last symbol in the number. The Olmec and Maya civilizations used 0 as a separate number as early as the , but this usage did not spread beyond Mesoamerica. The use of a numeral 0 in modern times originated with the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta in 628 CE. However, 0 had been used as a number in the medieval computus (the calculation of the date of Easter), beginning with Dionysius Exiguus in 525 CE, without being denoted by a numeral. Standard Roman numerals do not have a symbol for 0; instead, &quot;nulla&quot; (or the genitive form &quot;nullae&quot;) from , the Latin word for &quot;none&quot;, was employed to denote a 0 value.

The first systematic study of numbers as abstractions is usually credited to the Greek philosophers Pythagoras and Archimedes. Some Greek mathematicians treated the number 1 differently than larger numbers, sometimes even not as a number at all. Euclid, for example, defined a unit first and then a number as a multitude of units, thus by his definition, a unit is not a number and there are no unique numbers (e.g., any two units from indefinitely many units is a 2). However, in the definition of perfect number which comes shortly afterward, Euclid treats 1 as a number like any other.

Independent studies on numbers also occurred at around the same time in India, China, and Mesoamerica.

===Emergence as a term===
Nicolas Chuquet used the term &quot;progression naturelle&quot; (natural progression) in 1484. The earliest known use of &quot;natural number&quot; as a complete English phrase is in 1763. The 1771 Encyclopaedia Britannica defines natural numbers in the logarithm article.

Starting at 0 or 1 has long been a matter of definition. In 1727, Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle wrote that his notions of distance and element led to defining the natural numbers as including or excluding 0. In 1889, Giuseppe Peano used N for the positive integers and started at 1, but he later changed to using N0 and N1. Historically, most definitions have excluded 0, but many mathematicians such as George A. Wentworth, Bertrand Russell, Nicolas Bourbaki, Paul Halmos, Stephen Cole Kleene, and John Horton Conway have preferred to include 0.

Mathematicians have noted tendencies in which definition is used, such as algebra texts including 0, number theory and analysis texts excluding 0, logic and set theory texts including 0, dictionaries excluding 0, school books (through high-school level) excluding 0, and upper-division college-level books including 0. There are exceptions to each of these tendencies and as of 2023 no formal survey has been conducted. Arguments raised include division by zero and the size of the empty set. Computer languages often start from zero when enumerating items like loop counters and string- or array-elements. Including 0 began to rise in popularity in the 1960s. The ISO 31-11 standard included 0 in the natural numbers in its first edition in 1978 and this has continued through its present edition as ISO 80000-2.

===Formal construction===

In 19th century Europe, there was mathematical and philosophical discussion about the exact nature of the natural numbers. Henri Poincaré stated that axioms can only be demonstrated in their finite application, and concluded that it is &quot;the power of the mind&quot; which allows conceiving of the indefinite repetition of the same act. Leopold Kronecker summarized his belief as &quot;God made the integers, all else is the work of man&quot;.

The constructivists saw a need to improve upon the logical rigor in the foundations of mathematics. In the 1860s, Hermann Grassmann suggested a recursive definition for natural numbers, thus stating they were not really natural—but a consequence of definitions. Later, two classes of such formal definitions emerged, using set theory and Peano&#x27;s axioms respectively. Later still, they were shown to be equivalent in most practical applications.

Set-theoretical definitions of natural numbers were initiated by Frege. He initially defined a natural number as the class of all sets that are in one-to-one correspondence with a particular set. However, this definition turned out to lead to paradoxes, including Russell&#x27;s paradox. To avoid such paradoxes, the formalism was modified so that a natural number is defined as a particular set, and any set that can be put into one-to-one correspondence with that set is said to have that number of elements.

In 1881, Charles Sanders Peirce provided the first axiomatization of natural-number arithmetic. In 1888, Richard Dedekind proposed another axiomatization of natural-number arithmetic, and in 1889, Peano published a simplified version of Dedekind&#x27;s axioms in his book &quot;The principles of arithmetic presented by a new method&quot; (). This approach is now called Peano arithmetic. It is based on an axiomatization of the properties of ordinal numbers: each natural number has a successor and every non-zero natural number has a unique predecessor. Peano arithmetic is equiconsistent with several weak systems of set theory. One such system is ZFC with the axiom of infinity replaced by its negation. Theorems that can be proved in ZFC but cannot be proved using the Peano Axioms include Goodstein&#x27;s theorem.

==Notation==
The set of all natural numbers is standardly denoted or formula_1 Older texts have occasionally employed as the symbol for this set.

Since natural numbers may contain or not, it may be important to know which version is referred to. This is often specified by the context, but may also be done by using a subscript or a superscript in the notation, such as:
* Naturals without zero: formula_2
* Naturals with zero: formula_3

Alternatively, since the natural numbers naturally form a subset of the integers (often they may be referred to as the positive, or the non-negative integers, respectively. To be unambiguous about whether 0 is included or not, sometimes a superscript &quot;formula_4&quot; or &quot;+&quot; is added in the former case, and a subscript (or superscript) &quot;0&quot; is added in the latter case:

:formula_5
:formula_6

==Properties==
This section uses the convention formula_7.

===Addition===
Given the set formula_8 of natural numbers and the successor function formula_9 sending each natural number to the next one, one can define addition of natural numbers recursively by setting and for all , . Thus, , , and so on. The algebraic structure formula_10 is a commutative monoid with identity element 0. It is a free monoid on one generator. This commutative monoid satisfies the cancellation property, so it can be embedded in a group. The smallest group containing the natural numbers is the integers.

If 1 is defined as , then . That is, is simply the successor of .

===Multiplication===
Analogously, given that addition has been defined, a multiplication operator formula_11 can be defined via and . This turns formula_12 into a free commutative monoid with identity element 1; a generator set for this monoid is the set of prime numbers.

===Relationship between addition and multiplication===
Addition and multiplication are compatible, which is expressed in the distribution law: . These properties of addition and multiplication make the natural numbers an instance of a commutative semiring. Semirings are an algebraic generalization of the natural numbers where multiplication is not necessarily commutative. The lack of additive inverses, which is equivalent to the fact that formula_8 is not closed under subtraction (that is, subtracting one natural from another does not always result in another natural), means that formula_8 is &quot;not&quot; a ring; instead it is a semiring (also known as a &quot;rig&quot;).

If the natural numbers are taken as &quot;excluding 0&quot;, and &quot;starting at 1&quot;, the definitions of + and × are as above, except that they begin with and . Furthermore, formula_15 has no identity element.

===Order===
In this section, juxtaposed variables such as indicate the product , and the standard order of operations is assumed.

A total order on the natural numbers is defined by letting if and only if there exists another natural number where . This order is compatible with the arithmetical operations in the following sense: if , and are natural numbers and , then and .

An important property of the natural numbers is that they are well-ordered: every non-empty set of natural numbers has a least element. The rank among well-ordered sets is expressed by an ordinal number; for the natural numbers, this is denoted as (omega).

===Division===
In this section, juxtaposed variables such as indicate the product , and the standard order of operations is assumed.

While it is in general not possible to divide one natural number by another and get a natural number as result, the procedure of &quot;division with remainder&quot; or Euclidean division is available as a substitute: for any two natural numbers and with there are natural numbers and such that
:formula_16

The number is called the &quot;quotient&quot; and is called the &quot;remainder&quot; of the division of by . The numbers and are uniquely determined by and . This Euclidean division is key to the several other properties (divisibility), algorithms (such as the Euclidean algorithm), and ideas in number theory.

===Algebraic properties satisfied by the natural numbers===
The addition (+) and multiplication (×) operations on natural numbers as defined above have several algebraic properties:
* Closure under addition and multiplication: for all natural numbers and , both and are natural numbers.
* Associativity: for all natural numbers , , and , and .
* Commutativity: for all natural numbers and , and .
* Existence of identity elements: for every natural number , and . 
** If the natural numbers are taken as &quot;excluding 0&quot;, and &quot;starting at 1&quot;, then for every natural number , . However, the &quot;existence of additive identity element&quot; property is not satisfied
* Distributivity of multiplication over addition for all natural numbers , , and , .
* No nonzero zero divisors: if and are natural numbers such that , then or (or both).

==Generalizations==
Two important generalizations of natural numbers arise from the two uses of counting and ordering: cardinal numbers and ordinal numbers.
* A natural number can be used to express the size of a finite set; more precisely, a cardinal number is a measure for the size of a set, which is even suitable for infinite sets. The numbering of cardinals usually begins at zero, to accommodate the empty set formula_17. This concept of &quot;size&quot; relies on maps between sets, such that two sets have the same size, exactly if there exists a bijection between them. The set of natural numbers itself, and any bijective image of it, is said to be &quot;countably infinite&quot; and to have cardinality aleph-null ().
* Natural numbers are also used as linguistic ordinal numbers: &quot;first&quot;, &quot;second&quot;, &quot;third&quot;, and so forth. The numbering of ordinals usually begins at zero, to accommodate the order type of the empty set formula_17. This way they can be assigned to the elements of a totally ordered finite set, and also to the elements of any well-ordered countably infinite set without limit points. This assignment can be generalized to general well-orderings with a cardinality beyond countability, to yield the ordinal numbers. An ordinal number may also be used to describe the notion of &quot;size&quot; for a well-ordered set, in a sense different from cardinality: if there is an order isomorphism (more than a bijection) between two well-ordered sets, they have the same ordinal number. The first ordinal number that is not a natural number is expressed as ; this is also the ordinal number of the set of natural numbers itself.

The least ordinal of cardinality (that is, the initial ordinal of ) is but many well-ordered sets with cardinal number have an ordinal number greater than .

For finite well-ordered sets, there is a one-to-one correspondence between ordinal and cardinal numbers; therefore they can both be expressed by the same natural number, the number of elements of the set. This number can also be used to describe the position of an element in a larger finite, or an infinite, sequence.

A countable non-standard model of arithmetic satisfying the Peano Arithmetic (that is, the first-order Peano axioms) was developed by Skolem in 1933. The hypernatural numbers are an uncountable model that can be constructed from the ordinary natural numbers via the ultrapower construction. Other generalizations are discussed in .

Georges Reeb used to claim provocatively that &quot;The naïve integers don&#x27;t fill up formula_8&quot;.

==Formal definitions==

There are two standard methods for formally defining natural numbers. The first one, named for Giuseppe Peano, consists of an autonomous axiomatic theory called Peano arithmetic, based on few axioms called Peano axioms.

The second definition is based on set theory. It defines the natural numbers as specific sets. More precisely, each natural number is defined as an explicitly defined set, whose elements allow counting the elements of other sets, in the sense that the sentence &quot;a set has elements&quot; means that there exists a one to one correspondence between the two sets and .

The sets used to define natural numbers satisfy Peano axioms. It follows that every theorem that can be stated and proved in Peano arithmetic can also be proved in set theory. However, the two definitions are not equivalent, as there are theorems that can be stated in terms of Peano arithmetic and proved in set theory, which are not &quot;provable&quot; inside Peano arithmetic. A probable example is Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem.

The definition of the integers as sets satisfying Peano axioms provide a model of Peano arithmetic inside set theory. An important consequence is that, if set theory is consistent (as it is usually guessed), then Peano arithmetic is consistent. In other words, if a contradiction could be proved in Peano arithmetic, then set theory would be contradictory, and every theorem of set theory would be both true and wrong. 

===Peano axioms===
The five Peano axioms are the following:

# 0 is a natural number.
# Every natural number has a successor which is also a natural number.
# 0 is not the successor of any natural number.
# If the successor of formula_20 equals the successor of formula_21, then formula_22 equals formula_23.
# The axiom of induction: If a statement is true of 0, and if the truth of that statement for a number implies its truth for the successor of that number, then the statement is true for every natural number.

These are not the original axioms published by Peano, but are named in his honor. Some forms of the Peano axioms have 1 in place of 0. In ordinary arithmetic, the successor of formula_22 is formula_25.

===Set-theoretic definition===
Intuitively, the natural number is the common property of all sets that have elements. So, it seems natural to define as an equivalence class under the relation &quot;can be made in one to one correspondence&quot;. This does not work in all set theories, as such an equivalence class would not be a set (because of Russell&#x27;s paradox). The standard solution is to define a particular set with elements that will be called the natural number .

The following definition was first published by John von Neumann, although Levy attributes the idea to unpublished work of Zermelo in 1916. As this definition extends to infinite set as a definition of ordinal number, the sets considered below are sometimes called von Neumann ordinals.

The definition proceeds as follows:
* Call , the empty set.
* Define the &quot;successor&quot; of any set by .
* By the axiom of infinity, there exist sets which contain 0 and are closed under the successor function. Such sets are said to be &quot;inductive&quot;. The intersection of all inductive sets is still an inductive set.
* This intersection is the set of the &quot;natural numbers&quot;.

It follows that the natural numbers are defined iteratively as follows:
:*,
:* ,
:* etc.

It can be checked that the natural numbers satisfy the Peano axioms.

With this definition, given a natural number , the sentence &quot;a set has elements&quot; can be formally defined as &quot;there exists a bijection from to .&quot; This formalizes the operation of &quot;counting&quot; the elements of . Also, if and only if is a subset of . In other words, the set inclusion defines the usual total order on the natural numbers. This order is a well-order.

It follows from the definition that each natural number is equal to the set of all natural numbers less than it. This definition, can be extended to the von Neumann definition of ordinals for defining all ordinal numbers, including the infinite ones: &quot;each ordinal is the well-ordered set of all smaller ordinals.&quot;

If one does not accept the axiom of infinity, the natural numbers may not form a set. Nevertheless, the natural numbers can still be individually defined as above, and they still satisfy the Peano axioms.

There are other set theoretical constructions. In particular, Ernst Zermelo provided a construction that is nowadays only of historical interest, and is sometimes referred to as . It consists in defining as the empty set, and .

With this definition each nonzero natural number is a singleton set. So, the property of the natural numbers to represent cardinalities is not directly accessible; only the ordinal property (being the th element of a sequence) is immediate. Unlike von Neumann&#x27;s construction, the Zermelo ordinals do not extend to infinite ordinals.

<text>The natural logarithm of a number is its logarithm to the base of the mathematical constant , which is an irrational and transcendental number approximately equal to . The natural logarithm of is generally written as , , or sometimes, if the base is implicit, simply . Parentheses are sometimes added for clarity, giving , , or . This is done particularly when the argument to the logarithm is not a single symbol, so as to prevent ambiguity.

The natural logarithm of is the power to which would have to be raised to equal . For example, is , because . The natural logarithm of itself, , is , because , while the natural logarithm of is , since .

The natural logarithm can be defined for any positive real number as the area under the curve from to (with the area being negative when ). The simplicity of this definition, which is matched in many other formulas involving the natural logarithm, leads to the term &quot;natural&quot;. The definition of the natural logarithm can then be extended to give logarithm values for negative numbers and for all non-zero complex numbers, although this leads to a multi-valued function: see complex logarithm for more.

The natural logarithm function, if considered as a real-valued function of a positive real variable, is the inverse function of the exponential function, leading to the identities:
formula_1

Like all logarithms, the natural logarithm maps multiplication of positive numbers into addition:
formula_2

Logarithms can be defined for any positive base other than 1, not only . However, logarithms in other bases differ only by a constant multiplier from the natural logarithm, and can be defined in terms of the latter, formula_3.

Logarithms are useful for solving equations in which the unknown appears as the exponent of some other quantity. For example, logarithms are used to solve for the half-life, decay constant, or unknown time in exponential decay problems. They are important in many branches of mathematics and scientific disciplines, and are used to solve problems involving compound interest.

==History==
The concept of the natural logarithm was worked out by Gregoire de Saint-Vincent and Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa before 1649. Their work involved quadrature of the hyperbola with equation , by determination of the area of hyperbolic sectors. Their solution generated the requisite &quot;hyperbolic logarithm&quot; function, which had the properties now associated with the natural logarithm.

An early mention of the natural logarithm was by Nicholas Mercator in his work &quot;Logarithmotechnia&quot;, published in 1668, although the mathematics teacher John Speidell had already compiled a table of what in fact were effectively natural logarithms in 1619. It has been said that Speidell&#x27;s logarithms were to the base , but this is not entirely true due to complications with the values being expressed as integers.

==Notational conventions==
The notations and both refer unambiguously to the natural logarithm of , and without an explicit base may also refer to the natural logarithm. This usage is common in mathematics, along with some scientific contexts as well as in many programming languages. In some other contexts such as chemistry, however, can be used to denote the common (base 10) logarithm. It may also refer to the binary (base 2) logarithm in the context of computer science, particularly in the context of time complexity.

Generally, the notation for the logarithm to base of a number is shown as . So the of to the base would be .

==Definitions==
The natural logarithm can be defined in several equivalent ways.

===Inverse of exponential===
The most general definition is as the inverse function of formula_4, so that formula_5. Because formula_4 is positive and invertible for any real input formula_7, this definition of formula_8 is well defined for any positive .

===Integral definition===

The natural logarithm of a positive, real number may be defined as the area under the graph of the hyperbola with equation between and . This is the integral
formula_9
If is in formula_10, then the region has negative area, and the logarithm is negative.

This function is a logarithm because it satisfies the fundamental multiplicative property of a logarithm:
formula_11

This can be demonstrated by splitting the integral that defines into two parts, and then making the variable substitution (so ) in the second part, as follows:
formula_12

In elementary terms, this is simply scaling by in the horizontal direction and by in the vertical direction. Area does not change under this transformation, but the region between and is reconfigured. Because the function is equal to the function , the resulting area is precisely .

The number can then be defined to be the unique real number such that .

==Properties==
The natural logarithm has the following mathematical properties:
* formula_13
* formula_14
* formula_15
* formula_16
* formula_17
* formula_18
* formula_19
* formula_20
* formula_21
* formula_22
* formula_23

== Derivative ==

The derivative of the natural logarithm as a real-valued function on the positive reals is given by
formula_24

How to establish this derivative of the natural logarithm depends on how it is defined firsthand. If the natural logarithm is defined as the integral
formula_25
then the derivative immediately follows from the first part of the fundamental theorem of calculus.

On the other hand, if the natural logarithm is defined as the inverse of the (natural) exponential function, then the derivative (for ) can be found by using the properties of the logarithm and a definition of the exponential function.

From the definition of the number formula_26 the exponential function can be defined as
formula_27 where formula_28

The derivative can then be found from first principles.
formula_29

Also, we have:
formula_30

so, unlike its inverse function formula_31, a constant in the function doesn&#x27;t alter the differential.

== Series ==

Since the natural logarithm is undefined at 0, formula_8 itself does not have a Maclaurin series, unlike many other elementary functions. Instead, one looks for Taylor expansions around other points. For example, if formula_33 then
formula_34

This is the Taylor series for formula_35 around 1. A change of variables yields the Mercator series:
formula_36
valid for formula_37 and formula_38

Leonhard Euler, disregarding formula_39, nevertheless applied this series to formula_40 to show that the harmonic series equals the natural logarithm of formula_41; that is, the logarithm of infinity. Nowadays, more formally, one can prove that the harmonic series truncated at is close to the logarithm of , when is large, with the difference converging to the Euler–Mascheroni constant.

The figure is a graph of and some of its Taylor polynomials around 0. These approximations converge to the function only in the region ; outside this region, the higher-degree Taylor polynomials devolve to &quot;worse&quot; approximations for the function.

A useful special case for positive integers , taking formula_42, is:
formula_43

If formula_44 then
formula_45

Now, taking formula_46 for positive integers , we get:
formula_47

If formula_48 then
formula_49
Since
formula_50 
we arrive at
formula_51
Using the substitution formula_46 again for positive integers , we get: 
formula_53

This is, by far, the fastest converging of the series described here.

The natural logarithm can also be expressed as an infinite product:
formula_54

Two examples might be:
formula_55
formula_56

From this identity, we can easily get that:
formula_57

For example:
formula_58

==The natural logarithm in integration==
The natural logarithm allows simple integration of functions of the form formula_59: an antiderivative of is given by formula_60. This is the case because of the chain rule and the following fact:
formula_61

In other words, when integrating over an interval of the real line that does not include formula_62, then
formula_63
where is an arbitrary constant of integration.

Likewise, when the integral is over an interval where formula_64, 
:formula_65
For example, consider the integral of formula_66 over an interval that does not include points where formula_66 is infinite:
formula_68

The natural logarithm can be integrated using integration by parts:
formula_69

Let:
formula_70
formula_71
then:
formula_72

==Efficient computation==

For formula_73 where , the closer the value of is to 1, the faster the rate of convergence of its Taylor series centered at 1. The identities associated with the logarithm can be leveraged to exploit this:
formula_74

Such techniques were used before calculators, by referring to numerical tables and performing manipulations such as those above.

===Natural logarithm of 10===
The natural logarithm of 10, approximately equal to , plays a role for example in the computation of natural logarithms of numbers represented in scientific notation, as a mantissa multiplied by a power of 10:
formula_75

This means that one can effectively calculate the logarithms of numbers with very large or very small magnitude using the logarithms of a relatively small set of decimals in the range .

===High precision===
To compute the natural logarithm with many digits of precision, the Taylor series approach is not efficient since the convergence is slow. Especially if is near 1, a good alternative is to use Halley&#x27;s method or Newton&#x27;s method to invert the exponential function, because the series of the exponential function converges more quickly. For finding the value of to give formula_76 using Halley&#x27;s method, or equivalently to give formula_77 using Newton&#x27;s method, the iteration simplifies to
formula_78
which has cubic convergence to formula_73.

Another alternative for extremely high precision calculation is the formula
formula_80
where denotes the arithmetic-geometric mean of 1 and , and
formula_81
with chosen so that bits of precision is attained. (For most purposes, the value of 8 for is sufficient.) In fact, if this method is used, Newton inversion of the natural logarithm may conversely be used to calculate the exponential function efficiently. (The constants formula_82 and  can be pre-computed to the desired precision using any of several known quickly converging series.) Or, the following formula can be used:
formula_83

where
formula_84
are the Jacobi theta functions.

Based on a proposal by William Kahan and first implemented in the Hewlett-Packard HP-41C calculator in 1979 (referred to under &quot;LN1&quot; in the display, only), some calculators, operating systems (for example Berkeley UNIX 4.3BSD), computer algebra systems and programming languages (for example C99) provide a special natural logarithm plus 1 function, alternatively named LNP1, or log1p to give more accurate results for logarithms close to zero by passing arguments , also close to zero, to a function , which returns the value , instead of passing a value close to 1 to a function returning . The function avoids in the floating point arithmetic a near cancelling of the absolute term 1 with the second term from the Taylor expansion of the natural logarithm. This keeps the argument, the result, and intermediate steps all close to zero where they can be most accurately represented as floating-point numbers.

In addition to base , the IEEE 754-2008 standard defines similar logarithmic functions near 1 for binary and decimal logarithms: and .

Similar inverse functions named &quot;expm1&quot;, &quot;expm&quot; or &quot;exp1m&quot; exist as well, all with the meaning of .

An identity in terms of the inverse hyperbolic tangent,
formula_85
gives a high precision value for small values of on systems that do not implement .

===Computational complexity===

The computational complexity of computing the natural logarithm using the arithmetic-geometric mean (for both of the above methods) is formula_86. Here, is the number of digits of precision at which the natural logarithm is to be evaluated, and is the computational complexity of multiplying two -digit numbers.

==Continued fractions==
While no simple continued fractions are available, several generalized continued fractions exist, including:
formula_87
formula_88

These continued fractions—particularly the last—converge rapidly for values close to 1. However, the natural logarithms of much larger numbers can easily be computed, by repeatedly adding those of smaller numbers, with similarly rapid convergence.

For example, since 2 = 1.253 × 1.024, the natural logarithm of 2 can be computed as:
formula_89

Furthermore, since 10 = 1.2510 × 1.0243, even the natural logarithm of 10 can be computed similarly as:
formula_90
The reciprocal of the natural logarithm can be also written in this way:
formula_91

For example:
formula_92

==Complex logarithms==

The exponential function can be extended to a function which gives a complex number as for any arbitrary complex number ; simply use the infinite series with =z complex. This exponential function can be inverted to form a complex logarithm that exhibits most of the properties of the ordinary logarithm. There are two difficulties involved: no has ; and it turns out that . Since the multiplicative property still works for the complex exponential function, , for all complex and integers .

So the logarithm cannot be defined for the whole complex plane, and even then it is multi-valued—any complex logarithm can be changed into an &quot;equivalent&quot; logarithm by adding any integer multiple of at will. The complex logarithm can only be single-valued on the cut plane. For example, or or , etc.; and although can be defined as , or or , and so on.

<text>The Neogene ( ,) is a geologic period and system that spans 20.45 million years from the end of the Paleogene Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the present Quaternary Period million years ago. It is the second period of the Cenozoic and the eleventh period of the Phanerozoic. The Neogene is sub-divided into two epochs, the earlier Miocene and the later Pliocene. Some geologists assert that the Neogene cannot be clearly delineated from the modern geological period, the Quaternary. The term &quot;Neogene&quot; was coined in 1853 by the Austrian palaeontologist Moritz Hörnes (1815–1868). The earlier term Tertiary Period was used to define the span of time now covered by Paleogene and Neogene and, despite no longer being recognized as a formal stratigraphic term, &quot;Tertiary&quot; still sometimes remains in informal use.

During this period, mammals and birds continued to evolve into modern forms, while other groups of life remained relatively unchanged. The first humans (&quot;Homo habilis&quot;) appeared in Africa near the end of the period. Some continental movements took place, the most significant event being the connection of North and South America at the Isthmus of Panama, late in the Pliocene. This cut off the warm ocean currents from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean, leaving only the Gulf Stream to transfer heat to the Arctic Ocean. The global climate cooled considerably throughout the Neogene, culminating in a series of continental glaciations in the Quaternary Period that followed.

==Divisions==
In ICS terminology, from upper (later, more recent) to lower (earlier):

The Pliocene Epoch is subdivided into two ages:

* Piacenzian Age, preceded by
* Zanclean Age

The Miocene Epoch is subdivided into six ages:

* Messinian Age, preceded by
* Tortonian Age
* Serravallian Age
* Langhian Age
* Burdigalian Age
* Aquitanian Age
In different geophysical regions of the world, other regional names are also used for the same or overlapping ages and other timeline subdivisions.

The terms &quot;Neogene System&quot; (formal) and &quot;Upper Tertiary System&quot; (informal) describe the rocks deposited during the &quot;Neogene Period&quot;.

==Paleogeography==
The continents in the Neogene were very close to their current positions. The Isthmus of Panama formed, connecting North and South America. The Indian subcontinent continued to collide with Asia, forming the Himalayas. Sea levels fell, creating land bridges between Africa and Eurasia and between Eurasia and North America.

==Climate==
The global climate became more seasonal and continued an overall drying and cooling trend which began during the Paleogene. The Early Miocene was relatively cool; Early Miocene mid-latitude seawater and continental thermal gradients were already very similar to those of the present. During the Middle Miocene, Earth entered a warm phase known as the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO), which was driven by the emplacement of the Columbia River Basalt Group. Around 11 Ma, the Middle Miocene Warm Interval gave way to the much cooler Late Miocene. The ice caps on both poles began to grow and thicken, a process enhanced by positive feedbacks from increased formation of sea ice. Between 7 and 5.3 Ma, a decrease in global temperatures termed the Late Miocene Cooling (LMC) ensued, driven by decreases in carbon dioxide concentrations. During the Pliocene, from about 5.3 to 2.7 Ma, another warm interval occurred, being known as the Pliocene Warm Interval (PWI), interrupting the longer-term cooling trend. The Pliocene Thermal Maximum (PTM) occurred between 3.3 and 3.0 Ma. During the Pliocene, Green Sahara phases of wet conditions in North Africa were frequent and occurred about every 21 kyr, being especially intense when Earth&#x27;s orbit&#x27;s eccentricity was high. The PWI had similar levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide to contemporary times and is often seen as an analogous climate to the projected climate of the near future as a result of anthropogenic global warming. Towards the end of the Pliocene, decreased heat transport towards the Antarctic resulting from a weakening of the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) cooled the Earth, a process that exacerbated itself in a positive feedback as sea levels dropped and the ITF diminished and further limited the heat transported southward by the Leeuwin Current. By the end of the period the first of a series of glaciations of the current Ice Age began.

==Flora and fauna==
Marine and continental flora and fauna have a modern appearance. The reptile group Choristodera went extinct in the early part of the period, while the amphibians known as Allocaudata disappeared at the end of it. Neogene also marked the end of the reptilian genera Langstonia and Barinasuchus, terrestrial predators that were the last surviving members of Sebecosuchia, a group related to crocodiles. The oceans were dominated by large carnivores like megalodons and livyatans, and 19 million years ago about 70% of all pelagic shark species disappeared. Mammals and birds continued to be the dominant terrestrial vertebrates, and took many forms as they adapted to various habitats. An explosive radiation of ursids took place at the Miocene-Pliocene boundary. The first hominins, the ancestors of humans, may have appeared in southern Europe and migrated into Africa. The first humans (belonging to the species &quot;Homo habilis&quot;) appeared in Africa near the end of the period.

About 20 million years ago gymnosperms in the form of some conifer and cycad groups started to diversify and produce more species due to the changing conditions. In response to the cooler, seasonal climate, tropical plant species gave way to deciduous ones and grasslands replaced many forests. Grasses therefore greatly diversified, and herbivorous mammals evolved alongside it, creating the many grazing animals of today such as horses, antelope, and bison. Ice age mammals like the mammoths and woolly rhinoceros were common in Pliocene. With lower levels of in the atmosphere, plants expanded and reached ecological dominance in grasslands during the last 10 million years. Also Asteraceae (daisies) went through a significant adaptive radiation. &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; fossil leaves occur in the Miocene of New Zealand, where the genus is not native today, but have been introduced from Australia.

==Disagreements==
The Neogene traditionally ended at the end of the Pliocene Epoch, just before the older definition of the beginning of the Quaternary Period; many time scales show this division.

However, there was a movement amongst geologists (particularly marine geologists) to also include ongoing geological time (Quaternary) in the Neogene, while others (particularly terrestrial geologists) insist the Quaternary to be a separate period of distinctly different record. The somewhat confusing terminology and disagreement amongst geologists on where to draw what hierarchical boundaries is due to the comparatively fine divisibility of time units as time approaches the present, and due to geological preservation that causes the youngest sedimentary geological record to be preserved over a much larger area and to reflect many more environments than the older geological record. By dividing the Cenozoic Era into three (arguably two) periods (Paleogene, Neogene, Quaternary) instead of seven epochs, the periods are more closely comparable to the duration of periods in the Mesozoic and Paleozoic Eras.

The International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) once proposed that the Quaternary be considered a sub-era (sub-erathem) of the Neogene, with a beginning date of 2.58 Ma, namely the start of the Gelasian Stage. In the 2004 proposal of the ICS, the Neogene would have consisted of the Miocene and Pliocene Epochs. The International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA) counterproposed that the Neogene and the Pliocene end at 2.58 Ma, that the Gelasian be transferred to the Pleistocene, and the Quaternary be recognized as the third period in the Cenozoic, citing key changes in Earth&#x27;s climate, oceans, and biota that occurred 2.58 Ma and its correspondence to the Gauss-Matuyama magnetostratigraphic boundary. In 2006 ICS and INQUA reached a compromise that made Quaternary a sub-era, subdividing Cenozoic into the old classical Tertiary and Quaternary, a compromise that was rejected by International Union of Geological Sciences because it split both Neogene and Pliocene in two.

Following formal discussions at the 2008 International Geological Congress in Oslo, Norway, the ICS decided in May 2009 to make the Quaternary the youngest period of the Cenozoic Era with its base at 2.58 Mya and including the Gelasian Age, which was formerly considered part of the Neogene Period and Pliocene Epoch. Thus the Neogene Period ends bounding the succeeding Quaternary Period at 2.58 Mya.

<text>A notary public ( notary or public notary; notaries public) of the common law is a public officer constituted by law to serve the public in non-contentious matters usually concerned with general financial transactions, estates, deeds, powers-of-attorney, and foreign and international business. A notary&#x27;s main functions are to validate the signature of a person (for purposes of signing a document); administer oaths and affirmations; take affidavits and statutory declarations, including from witnesses; authenticate the execution of certain classes of documents; take acknowledgments (e.g., of deeds and other conveyances); provide notice of foreign drafts; provide exemplifications and notarial copies; and, to perform certain other official acts depending on the jurisdiction. Such transactions are known as notarial acts, or more commonly, notarizations. The term &quot;notary public&quot; only refers to common-law notaries and should not be confused with civil-law notaries.

With the exceptions of Louisiana, Puerto Rico, Quebec (whose private law is based on civil law), and British Columbia (whose notarial tradition stems from scrivener notary practice), a notary public in the rest of the United States and most of Canada has powers that are far more limited than those of civil-law or other common-law notaries, both of whom are qualified lawyers admitted to the bar: such notaries may be referred to as notaries-at-law or lawyer notaries. Therefore, at common law, notarial service is distinctly different from the practice of law, and giving legal advice and preparing legal instruments is forbidden to lay notaries such as those appointed throughout most of the United States. Despite these distinctions, lawyers in the United States may apply to become notaries, and this class of notary is allowed to provide legal advice, such as determining the type of act required (affidavit, acknowledgment, etc.).

==Overview==
Notaries are appointed by a government authority, such as a court, governor, county commissioners, or lieutenant governor, or by a regulating body often known as a society or faculty of notaries public. For lawyer notaries, an appointment may be for life, while lay notaries are usually commissioned for a briefer term (often 3 to 5 years in the U.S.), with the possibility of renewal.

In most common law countries, appointments and their number for a given notarial district are highly regulated. However, since the majority of American notaries are lay persons who provide officially required services, commission numbers are not regulated, which is part of the reason why there are far more notaries in the United States than in other countries (4.5 million vs. approx. 740 in England and Wales and approx. 1,250 in Australia and New Zealand). Furthermore, all U.S. and some Canadian notarial functions are applied to domestic affairs and documents, where fully systematized attestations of signatures and acknowledgment of deeds are a universal requirement for document authentication. In the U.S., notaries public do not authenticate &quot;documents&quot; in a traditional sense: instead, they authenticate that the &quot;signature(s)&quot; on a document belongs to the person(s) claiming to be the signer(s), thus ensuring trust among interested parties. By contrast, outside North American common law jurisdictions, notarial practice is restricted to international legal matters or where a foreign jurisdiction is involved, and almost all notaries are also qualified lawyers.

For the purposes of authentication, most countries require commercial or personal documents which originate from or are signed in another country to be notarized before they can be used or officially recorded or before they can have any legal effect. To these documents a notary affixes a notarial certificate–a separate document stating the notarial act performed and upon which the party(ies) and notary sign–which attests to the execution of the document, usually by the person who appears before the notary, known as an appearer or constituent (U.S.). In the U.S., many documents include the notarial wording within the document, thus eliminating the need for an additional page for the certificate only (i.e., the document is signed and notarized, including application of the Notary&#x27;s seal). In cases where notaries are also lawyers, such a notary may also draft legal instruments known as notarial acts or deeds which have probative value and executory force, as they do in civil law jurisdictions. Originals or secondary originals are then filed and stored in the notary&#x27;s archives, or protocol. As noted, &quot;lay&quot; notaries public in the U.S. are forbidden to advise signers as to which type of act suits the signer&#x27;s situation: instead, the signer must provide the certificate/wording that is appropriate.

Notaries are generally required to undergo special training in the performance of their duties, often culminating in an examination and ongoing education/re-examination upon commission renewal. Some states have no training for their notaries public. Some must also first serve as an apprentice before being commissioned or licensed to practice their profession. In some countries, even licensed lawyers, e.g., barristers or solicitors, must follow a prescribed specialized course of study and be mentored for two years before being allowed to practice as a notary (e.g., British Columbia, England). However, notaries public in the U.S., of which the vast majority are lay people, require only a brief training seminar and are expressly forbidden to engage in any activities that could be construed as the unlicensed practice of law unless they are also qualified attorneys. That said, even lay notaries public must know all applicable laws in their jurisdiction (e.g., state) to practice, and a commission could be revoked for a single deviation from such laws. Notarial practice is universally considered to be distinct and separate from that of an attorney (solicitor/barrister). In England and Wales, there is a course of study for notaries which is conducted under the auspices of the University of Cambridge and the Society of Notaries of England and Wales. In the State of Victoria, Australia, applicants for appointment must first complete a Graduate Diploma of Notarial Practice which is administered by the Sir Zelman Cowen Centre in Victoria University, Melbourne. The United States is a notable exception to these practices: lawyer-notaries need only be approved by their jurisdiction and possibly by a local court or bar association.

In bi-juridical jurisdictions, such as South Africa or Louisiana, the office of notary public is a legal profession with educational requirements similar to those for attorneys. Many even have institutes of higher learning that offer degrees in notarial law. Therefore, despite their name, &quot;notaries public&quot; in these jurisdictions are in effect civil law notaries.

==History==
Notaries public (also called &quot;notaries&quot;, &quot;notarial officers&quot;, or &quot;public notaries&quot;) hold an office that can trace its origins back to the ancient Roman Republic, when they were called &quot;scribae&quot; (&quot;scribes&quot;), &quot;tabelliones forenses&quot;, or &quot;personae publicae&quot;.

The history of notaries is set out in detail in Chapter 1 of &quot;Brooke&#x27;s Notary&quot; (13th edition):

==Common law jurisdictions==
The duties and functions of notaries public are described in &quot;Brooke&#x27;s Notary&quot; on page 19 in these terms:

A notary, in almost all common law jurisdictions other than most of North America, is a practitioner trained in the drafting and execution of legal documents. Historically, notaries recorded matters of judicial importance in addition to private transactions or events where an officially authenticated record or a document drawn up with professional skill or knowledge was required. The functions of notaries specifically include the preparation of certain types of documents (including international contracts, deeds, wills, and powers of attorney) and certification of their due execution, administering of oaths, witnessing affidavits and statutory declarations, certification of copy documents, noting and protesting of bills of exchange, and the preparation of ships&#x27; protests.

Documents certified by notaries are sealed with the notary&#x27;s seal (which may be a traditional embossed marking or a modern stamp) and are often, as a matter of best practice or else jurisdictional law, recorded by the notary in a register (also called a &quot;protocol&quot;) maintained and permanently kept by him or her. The use of a seal by definition means a &quot;notarial act&quot; was performed. 
In countries subscribing to the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalization for Foreign Public Documents or Apostille Convention, additional steps are required for use of documents across international borders. Some documents must be notarized locally and then sealed by the regulating authority (e.g., in the U.S., the Secretary of State of the state in which the notary is commissioned)–sometimes, documents may skip directly to this level–and then a final act of certification is required, known as an apostille. The apostille is issued by a government department (usually the Foreign Affairs Department; the Department of State in the U.S.; or similar). For countries which are not subscribers to that convention, an &quot;authentication&quot; or &quot;legalization&quot; must be provided by one of a number of methods, including by the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the country from which the document is being sent or the embassy, Consulate-General, consulate or High Commission of the country to which it is being sent.

==Information on individual countries==

===Australia===
In all Australian states and territories (except Queensland) notaries public are appointed by the Supreme Court of the relevant state or territory. Very few have been appointed as a notary for more than one state or territory.

Queensland, like New Zealand, continues the practice of appointment by the Archbishop of Canterbury acting through the Master of the Faculties.

Australian notaries are lawyers and are members of the Australian and New Zealand College of Notaries, the Society of Notaries of New South Wales Inc., the Public Notaries Society of Western Australia Inc, and other state-based societies. The overall number of lawyers who choose to become a notary is relatively low. For example, in South Australia (a state with a population of 1.5 million), of the over 2,500 lawyers in that state only about 100 are also notaries and most of those do not actively practice as such. In Melbourne, Victoria, in 2002 there were only 66 notaries for a city with a population of 3.5 million and only 90 for the entire state. In Western Australia, there are approximately 58 notaries as at 2017 for a city with a population of 2.07 million people. Compare this with the United States where it has been estimated that there are nearly 5 million notaries for a nation with a population of 296 million.

As Justice Debelle of the Supreme Court of South Australia said in the case of &quot;In The Matter of an Application by Marilyn Reys Bos to be a Public Notary&quot; [2003] SASC 320, delivered 12 September 2003, in refusing the application by a non-lawyer for appointment as a notary:

Historically there have been some very rare examples of patent attorneys or accountants being appointed, but that now seems to have ceased.

However, there are three significant differences between notaries and other lawyers.

*the duty of a notary is to the transaction as a whole, and not just to one of the parties. In certain circumstances a notary may act for both parties to a transaction as long as there is no conflict between them, and in such cases it is their duty is to ensure that the transaction that they conclude is fair to both sides.
*a notary will often need to place and complete a special clause onto or attach a special page (known as an eschatocol) to a document in order to make it valid for use overseas.In the case of some documents which are to be used in some foreign countries it may also be necessary to obtain another certificate known either as an &quot;authentication&quot; or an &quot;apostille&quot; (see above) (depending on the relevant foreign country) from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
*a notary identifies themselves on documents by the use of their individual seal. Such seals have historical origins and are regarded by most other countries as of great importance for establishing the authenticity of a document.

Their principal duties include:

# attestation of documents and certification of their due execution for use internationally
# preparation and certification of powers of attorney, wills, deeds, contracts and other legal documents for use internationally
# administering of oaths for use internationally
# witnessing affidavits, statutory declarations and other documents for use internationally
# certification of copy documents for use internationally
# exemplification of official documents for use internationally
# noting and protesting of bills of exchange (which is rarely performed)
# preparation of ships&#x27; protests
# providing certificates as to Australian law and legal practice for use internationally

It is usual for Australian notaries to use an embossed seal with a red wafer, and now some notaries also use an inked stamp replicating the seal. It is also common for the seal or stamp to include the notary&#x27;s chosen logo or symbol.

In South Australia and Scotland, it is acceptable for a notary to use the letters &quot;NP&quot; after their name. Thus a South Australian notary may have &quot;John Smith LLB NP&quot; or similar on his business card or letterhead.

Australian notaries do not hold &quot;commissions&quot; which can expire. Generally, once appointed they are authorized to act as a notary for life and can only be &quot;struck off&quot; the Roll of Notaries for proven misconduct. In certain states, for example, New South Wales and Victoria, they cease to be qualified to continue as a notary once they cease to hold a practicing certificate as a legal practitioner. Even judges, who do not hold practicing certificates, are not eligible to continue to practice as notaries.

Notaries in some states of Australia are regulated by legislation. In New South Wales the Public Notaries Act 1997 applies and in Victoria the Public Notaries Act 2001 applies.

There are also Notary Societies throughout Australia and the societies keep a searchable list of their members. In New South Wales, The Society of Notaries of New South Wales Inc.; in Queensland The Society of Notaries Queensland Inc.; in South Australia the Notaries&#x27; Society of South Australia Inc. and in Victoria, The Society of Notaries of Victoria Inc..

Notaries collecting information for the purposes of verification of the signature of the deponent might retain the details of documents which identify the deponent, and this information is subject to the Privacy Act 1988. A notary must protect the personal information the notary holds from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

All Australian jurisdictions also have justices of the peace (JP) or commissioners for affidavits and other unqualified persons who are qualified to take affidavits or statutory declarations and to certify documents. However they can only do so if the relevant affidavit, statutory declaration or copy document is to be used only in Australia and not in a foreign country, with the possible exception of a few Commonwealth countries not including the United Kingdom or New Zealand except for very limited purposes. Justices of the peace (JPs) are (usually) laypersons who have minimal, if any, training (depending on the jurisdiction) but are of proven good character. Therefore, a US notary resembles an Australian JP rather than an Australian notary.

===Brazil===
Notaries in Brazil need to pass stringent exams in addition to holding law degrees. Civil life in Brazil relies upon the notary public system heavily. Brazilian notaries public specialize in seven main areas: 1. Civil Records; 2. Notes. 3. Real Estate Records; 4. Credit Notes and Documents; 5. Protest of Credit Notes; 6. Business Enterprises Records; and 7. Central Notaries (a.k.a. &quot;Distribution Notaries). Brazilian notaries have a hybrid nature. They are private but appointed by the Judiciary and are recognized as an official authority (&quot;dotado de fé pública&quot;).

===Canada===
Canadian notaries public (except in the province of British Columbia and Quebec) are very much like their American counterparts, generally restricted to administering oaths, witnessing signatures on affidavits and statutory declarations, providing acknowledgements, certifying true copies, and so forth.

====British Columbia====
In British Columbia, a notary public is more like a British or Australian notary. Notaries are appointed for life by the Supreme Court of British Columbia and as a self-regulating profession, the Society of Notaries Public of British Columbia is the regulatory body overseeing and setting standards to maintain public confidence. A BC notary is also a commissioner for taking affidavits for British Columbia, by reason of office. Furthermore, BC notaries exercise far greater power, able to dispense legal advice and draft public instruments including:

* Notarization – notarizations/attestations of signatures, affidavits, statutory declarations, certified true copies, letters of invitation for foreign travel, authorization of minor child travel, execution/authentications of international documents, passport application documentation, proof of identity for travel purposes
* Real estate law – home purchase/sale; business purchase/sale; mortgages and refinancing; residential, commercial, and manufactures home transfer of title; restrictive covenants and builder&#x27;s liens
* Wills and estate planning – preparation and searches of last wills and testaments, advance directives, representation agreements and power of attorney
* Contract law – preparation of contracts and agreements, commercial lease and assignments
* easements and right of way
* insurance loss declarations
* marine bills of sale and mortgages
* marine protestations
* personal property security agreements
* purchaser&#x27;s side for foreclosures
* subdivisions and statutory building schemes
* zoning applications

====Nova Scotia====
In Nova Scotia a person may be a notary public, a commissioner of oaths, or both. A notary public and a commissioner of oaths are regulated by the provincial Notaries and Commissioners Act. Individuals hold a commission granted to them by the Minister of Justice.

Under the Act a notary public in has the &quot;power of drawing, passing, keeping and issuing all deeds and contracts, charter-parties and other mercantile transactions in this Province, and also of attesting all commercial instruments brought before him for public protestation, and otherwise of acting as is usual in the office of notary, and may demand, receive and have all the rights, profits and emoluments rightfully appertaining and belonging to the said calling of notary during pleasure.&quot;

Under the Act a commissioner of oaths is &quot;authorized to administer oaths and take and receive affidavits, declarations and affirmations within the Province in and concerning any cause, matter or thing, depending or to be had in the Supreme Court, or any other court in the Province.&quot;

Every barrister of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia is a commissioner of oaths but must receive an additional commission to act as a notary public.

&quot;A Commissioner of Oaths is deemed to be an officer of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. Commissioners take declarations concerning any matter to come before a court in the Province.&quot;. Additionally, individuals with other specific qualifications, such as being a current Member of the Legislative Assembly, commissioned officer of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or Canadian Forces may act as if explicitly being a commissioner of oaths.

====Quebec====
Since Quebec uses a civil law system for non-criminal matters, notaries in that province are civil-law notaries (&quot;notaires&quot;) that are full lawyers licensed to practice notarial law and regulated by the Chamber of Notaries of Quebec. Quebec notaries draft and prepare major legal instruments (notarial acts), provide complex legal advice, represent clients (out of court) and make appearances on their behalf, act as arbitrator, mediator, or conciliator, and even act as a court commissioner in non-contentious matters. To become a notary in Quebec, a candidate must hold a bachelor&#x27;s degree in civil law and a one-year Master&#x27;s in notarial law and serve a traineeship (&quot;stage&quot;) before being admitted to practice.

The concept of notaries public in Quebec does not exist. Instead, the province has Commissioners of Oaths (&quot;Commissaires à l&#x27;assermentation&quot;) who may administer oaths in Quebec (and outside of Quebec, if authorized) for a procedure or a document intended for Quebec (or Federal matters). A Quebec commissioner for oaths can not certify documents or attest that a copy of a document is in accordance to the original; only a &quot;notaire&quot; can do it.

===India===
The central government appoints notaries for the whole or any part of the country. State governments, too, appoint notaries for the whole or any part of the states. On an application being made, any person who had been practicing as a Lawyer for at least ten years is eligible to be appointed a notary. The applicant, if not a legal practitioner, should be a member of the Indian Legal Service or have held an office under the central or state government, requiring special knowledge of law, after enrollment as an advocate or held an office in the department of Judge, Advocate-General or in the armed forces.

===Iran===
Notary public is a trained lawyer that should pass some special examinations to be able to open their office and start their work. Persian meaning of this word is means head of the office and their assistant called . Both these persons should have bachelor&#x27;s degree in law or master&#x27;s degree in civil-law.

===Ireland===

There is archival evidence showing that public notaries, acting pursuant to papal and imperial authority, practised in Ireland in the 13th century, and it is reasonable to assume that notaries functioned here before that time. In Ireland, public notaries were at various times appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of Armagh. The position remained so until the Reformation.

After the Reformation, persons appointed to the office of public notary either in Great Britain or Ireland received the faculty by royal authority, and appointments under faculty from the Pope and the emperor ceased.

In 1871, under the Matrimonial Causes and Marriage Law (Ireland) Amendment 1870, the jurisdiction previously exercised by the Archbishop of Armagh in the appointment of notaries was vested in and became exercisable by the Lord Chancellor of Ireland.

In 1920, the power to appoint notaries public was transferred to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The position in Ireland changed once again in 1924 following the establishment of the Irish Free State. Under the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 the jurisdiction over notaries public was transferred to the Chief Justice of the Irish Free State.

In 1961, under the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act of that year, and the power to appoint notaries public became exercisable by the Chief Justice. This remains the position in Ireland, where notaries are appointed on petition to the Supreme Court, after passing prescribed examinations. The governing body is the Faculty of Notaries Public in Ireland. The vast majority of notaries in Ireland are also solicitors. A non-solicitor, who was successful in the examinations as set by the governing body, applied in the standard way to the Chief Justice to be appointed a notary public. The Chief Justice heard the adjourned application on 3 March 2009 and appointed the non-solicitor as a notary on 18 July 2011.

In Ireland notaries public cannot agree on a standard fee due to competition law. In practice the price per signature appears to be €100. A cheaper alternative is to visit a commissioner for oaths who will charge less per signature, but that is only possible where whoever is to receive a document will recognize the signature of a commissioner for oaths.

===Malaysia===
A notary public is a lawyer authorized by the Attorney General. The fees are regulated by the Notary Public (Fees) Rules 1954.

A commissioner for oaths is a person appointed by the Chief Justice under section 11 of Court of Judicature Act 1964, and Commissioners for Oaths Rules 1993.

===New Zealand===
A notary public in New Zealand is a lawyer authorised by the Archbishop of Canterbury in England to officially witness signatures on legal documents, collect sworn statements, administer oaths and certify the authenticity of legal documents usually for use overseas.

The Master of the Faculties appoints notaries in the exercise of the general authorities granted by s 3 of the Ecclesiastical Licences Act 1533 and Public Notaries Act 1833. Recommendations are made by the New Zealand Society of Notaries, which normally requires and applicant to have 10 years&#x27; experience post admission as a lawyer and 5 years as a Law Firm Partner or equivalent.

===Singapore===
A Notary Public in Singapore must be appointed by the Board of Commissioners for Oaths and Notaries Public. A Notary Public must be a qualified lawyer who is at least 40 years old, with at least 15 years of experience in active legal practice. The Notary Public is responsible for certifying the authenticity and valid execution of documents.

===Sri Lanka===
Notaries in Sri Lanka are more akin to civil law notaries, their main functions are conveyancing, drafting of legal instruments, etc. They are appointed under the Notaries Ordinance No 1 of 1907. They must pass exam held by the Ministry of Justice and apprentice under senior notary for a period of two years. Alternatively, attorneys at law who pass the conveyancing exam are also admitted as a notary public under warrant of the Minister. The Minister of Justice may appoint any attorney at law as a commissioner for oaths, authorized to certify and authenticate the affidavit/documents and any such other certificates that are submitted by the general public with the intention of certifying by the commissioner for oath.

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====

After the passage of the Ecclesiastical Licences Act 1533, which was a direct result of the Reformation in England, all notary appointments were issued directly through the Court of Faculties. The Court of Faculties is attached to the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury.

In England and Wales there are two main classes of notaries: general notaries and scrivener notaries. Their functions are almost identical. All notaries, like solicitors, barristers, legal executives, costs lawyers and licensed conveyancers, are also commissioners for oaths. They also acquire the same powers as solicitors and other law practitioners, with the exception of the right to represent others before the courts (unless also members of the bar or admitted as a solicitor) once they are commissioned notaries. In practice almost all English notaries, and all Scottish ones, are also solicitors, and usually practise as solicitors.

Commissioners of oaths are able to undertake the bulk of routine domestic attestation work in England and Wales. Many documents, including signatures for normal property transactions, do not need professional attestation of signature at all, a lay witness being sufficient.

In practice the need for notaries in purely English legal matters is very small; for example they are not involved in normal property transactions. Since a great many solicitors also perform the function of commissioners for oaths and can witness routine declarations etc. (all are qualified to do so, but not all offer the service), most work performed by notaries relates to international matters in some way. They witness or authenticate documents to be used abroad. Many English notaries have strong foreign language skills and often a foreign legal qualification. The work of notaries and solicitors in England is separate although most notaries are solicitors. The Notaries Society gives the number of notaries in England and Wales as &quot;about 1,000&quot;, all but seventy of whom are also solicitors.

Scrivener notaries get their name from the Worshipful Company of Scriveners. Until 1999, when they lost this monopoly, they were the only notaries permitted to practise in the City of London. They used not to have to first qualify as solicitors, but they had knowledge of foreign laws and languages.

Currently to qualify as a notary public in England and Wales it is necessary to have earned a law degree or qualified as a solicitor or barrister in the past five years, and then to take a two-year distance-learning course styled the Postgraduate Diploma in Notarial Practice. At the same time, any applicant must also gain practical experience. The few who go on to become scrivener notaries require further study of two foreign languages and foreign law and a two-year mentorship under an active scrivener notary.

The other notaries in England are either ecclesiastical notaries whose functions are limited to the affairs of the Church of England or other qualified persons who are not trained as solicitors or barristers but satisfy the Master of the Faculties of the Archbishop of Canterbury that they possess an adequate understanding of the law. Both the latter two categories are required to pass examinations set by the Master of Faculties.

The regulation of notaries was modernised by section 57 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990.

Notarial services generally include: 
* attesting the signature and execution of documents
* authenticating the execution of documents
* authenticating the contents of documents
* administration of oaths and declarations
* drawing up or noting (and extending) protests of happenings to ships, crews and cargoes
* presenting bills of exchange for acceptance and payment, noting and protesting bills in cases of dishonour and preparing acts of honour
* attending upon the drawing up of bonds
* drawing mercantile documents, deeds, sales or purchases of property, and wills in English and (via translation), in foreign languages for use in Britain, the Commonwealth and other foreign countries
* providing documents to deal with the administration of the estate of people who are abroad, or own property abroad
* authenticating personal documents and information for immigration or emigration purposes, or to apply to marry, divorce, adopt children or to work abroad
* verification of translations from foreign languages to English and vice versa
* taking evidence in England and Wales as a commissioner for oaths for foreign courts
* provision of notarial copies
* preparing and witnessing powers of attorney, corporate records, contracts for use in Britain or overseas
* authenticating company and business documents and transactions
* international Internet domain name transfers

====Scotland====
Notaries public have existed in Scotland since the 13th century and developed as a distinct element of the Scottish legal profession. Those who wish to practice as a notary must petition the Court of Session. This petition is usually presented at the same time as a petition to practice as a solicitor, but can sometimes be earlier or later. However, to qualify, a notary must hold a current Practising Certificate from the Law Society of Scotland, a new requirement from 2007, before which all Scottish solicitors were automatically notaries.

Whilst notaries in Scotland are always solicitors, the profession remains separate in that there are additional rules and regulations governing notaries and it is possible to be a solicitor, but not a notary. Since 2007 an additional Practising Certificate is required, so now most, but not all, solicitors in Scotland are notaries – a significant difference from the English profession. They are also separate from notaries in other jurisdictions of the United Kingdom.

The profession is administered by the Council of the Law Society of Scotland under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990.

In Scotland, the duties and services provided by the notary are similar to England and Wales, although they are needed for some declarations in divorce matters for which they are not in England. Their role declined following the Law Agents (Scotland) Amendment Act 1896 which stipulated only enrolled law agents could become notaries and the Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1924 which extended notarial execution to law agents. The primary functions of a Scottish notary are:
* oaths, affidavits, and affirmations
* affidavits in undefended divorces and for matrimonial homes
* maritime protests
* execution or certification for foreign jurisdictions, e.g., estates, court actions, powers of attorney, etc.
* notarial execution for the blind or illiterate
* entry of a person to overseas territories
* completion of the documentation required for the registration of a company in certain foreign jurisdictions; and
* drawing for repayment of Bonds of Debenture

===United States===
==Civil law jurisdictions==

The role of notaries in civil law countries is much greater than in common law countries. Civilian notaries are full-time lawyers and holders of a public office who routinely undertake non-contentious transactional work done in common law countries by attorneys/solicitors, as well as, in some countries, those of government registries, title offices, and public recorders. The qualifications imposed by civil law countries are much greater, requiring generally an undergraduate law degree, a graduate degree in notarial law and practice, three or more years of practical training (&quot;articles&quot;) under an established notary, and the sitting of a national examination, to be admitted to practice. Typically, notaries work in private practice and earn fees, but a small minority of countries have salaried public service (or &quot;government&quot; / &quot;state&quot;) notaries (e.g., Ukraine, Russia, Baden-Württemberg in Germany (until 2017), certain cantons of Switzerland, and Portugal).

Notaries in civil law countries have had a critical historical role in providing archives. A considerable amount of historical data of tremendous value is available in France, Spain and Italy thanks to notarial minutes, contracts and conveyances, some of great antiquity which have survived in spite of losses, deterioration and willful destruction.

Civil law notaries have jurisdiction over strictly non-contentious domestic civil-private law in the areas of property law, family law, agency, wills and succession, and company formation. The point to which a country&#x27;s notarial profession monopolizes these areas can vary greatly. On one extreme is France (and French-derived systems) which statutorily give notaries a monopoly over their reserved areas of practice, as opposed to Austria where there is no discernible monopoly whatsoever and notaries are in direct competition with attorneys/solicitors.

In the few United States jurisdictions where trained notaries are allowed (such as Louisiana and Puerto Rico), the practice of these legal practitioners is limited to legal advice on purely non-contentious matters that fall within the purview of a notary&#x27;s reserved areas of practice.

==Notable notaries==
Upon the death of President Warren G. Harding in 1923, Calvin Coolidge was sworn in as president by his father, John Calvin Coolidge, Sr., a Vermont notary public. As there was some controversy as to whether a state notary public had the authority to administer the presidential oath of office, Coolidge took the oath, again, upon returning to Washington.

<doc id="21482" wikidata="Q3870" url="?curid=21482" title="Nairobi">
<text>Nairobi ( ) is the capital and largest city of Kenya. The name is derived from the Maasai phrase , which translates to &#x27;place of cool waters&#x27;, a reference to the Nairobi River which flows through the city. The city proper had a population of 4,397,073 in the 2019 census. 

Nairobi is home of the Kenyan Parliament Buildings and hosts thousands of Kenyan businesses and key international companies and organisations, including the United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) and the United Nations Office at Nairobi (UNON). Nairobi is an established hub for business and culture. The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) is one of the largest stock exchanges in Africa and the second-oldest exchange on the continent. It is Africa&#x27;s fourth-largest stock exchange in terms of trading volume, capable of making 10 million trades a day. It also contains the Nairobi National Park. Nairobi joined the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities in 2010.

Nairobi was founded in 1899 by colonial authorities in British East Africa, as a rail depot on the Uganda - Kenya Railway. It was favoured by the authorities as an ideal resting place due to its high elevation, temperate climate, and adequate water supply. The town quickly grew to replace Mombasa as the capital of Kenya in 1907.

After independence in 1963, Nairobi became the capital of the Republic of Kenya. During Kenya&#x27;s early period, the city became a centre for the coffee, tea and sisal industries. The successive black governments since independence have built and turned Nairobi into a modern metropolitan city with a diverse population and a growing economy. Nairobi continues to thrive as the capital of Kenya.The city lies in the south central part of Kenya, at an elevation of .

==History==

===Early years===

The site of Nairobi was originally a swamp land occupied by a pastoralist people, the Maasai, the sedentary Akamba People, as well as the agriculturalist Kikuyu people. The name Nairobi itself comes from the Maasai expression meaning &#x27;cool waters&#x27;, referring to the cold water stream which flowed through the area. With the arrival of the Uganda Railway, the site was identified by Sir George Whitehouse for a store depot, shunting ground and camping ground for the Indian labourers working on the railway. Whitehouse, chief engineer of the railway, favoured the site as an ideal resting place due to its high elevation, temperate climate, adequate water supply and being situated before the steep ascent of the Limuru escarpments. His choice was however criticised by officials within the Protectorate government who felt the site was too flat, poorly drained and relatively infertile.
 During the pre-colonial era, the people of modern Kenya mostly lived in villages amongst their tribes and cultural groups, where they had rulers within their communities rather than one singular government or leader.

In 1898, Arthur Church was first and foremost commissioned to design the first town layout for the railway depot. It constituted two streets – Victoria Street and Station Street, ten avenues, staff quarters and an Indian commercial area. The railway arrived at Nairobi on 30 May 1899, and soon Nairobi replaced Machakos as the headquarters of the provincial administration for the Ukamba province. On the arrival of the railway, Whitehouse remarked that &quot;Nairobi itself will in the course of the next two years become a large and flourishing place and already there are many applications for sites for hotels, shops and houses.&quot; The town&#x27;s early years were however beset with problems of malaria leading to at least one attempt to have the town moved. In the early 1900s, Bazaar Street (now Biashara Street) was completely rebuilt after an outbreak of plague and the burning of the original town.

Between 1902 and 1910, the town&#x27;s population rose from 5,000 to 16,000 and grew around administration and tourism, initially in the form of big game hunting. In 1907, Nairobi replaced Mombasa as the capital of the East Africa Protectorate. In 1919, Nairobi was declared to be a municipality.

===Growth===
In 1921, Nairobi had 24,000 residents, of which 12,000 were native Africans. The next decade saw growth in native African communities in Nairobi, and they began to constitute a majority for the first time. This growth caused planning issues, described by Thorntorn White and his planning team as the &quot;Nairobi Problem&quot;. In February 1926, colonial officer Eric Dutton passed through Nairobi on his way to Mount Kenya, and said of the city:
After World War II, continuous expansion of the city angered both the indigenous Maasai and Kikuyu. This led to the Mau Mau Uprising in the 1950s, and the Lancaster House Conferences, which initiated a transition to Kenyan independence in 1963.

In the spring of 1950, the East African Trades Union Congress (EAUTC) led a nine-day general strike in the city.

===Post independence===

Nairobi remained the capital of Kenya after independence, and its continued rapid growth put pressure on the city&#x27;s infrastructure with power cuts and water shortages becoming a common occurrence.

On 11 September 1973, the Kenyatta International Conference Centre KICC was open to the public. The 28-storey building at the time was designed by the Norwegian architect Karl Henrik Nøstvik and Kenyan David Mutiso. It is the only building within the city with a helipad that is open to the public. Of the buildings built in the Seventies, the KICC was the most eco-friendly and most environmentally conscious structure; its main frame was constructed with locally available materials gravel, sand, cement and wood, and it had wide open spaces which allowed for natural aeration and natural lighting. Cuboids made up the plenary hall, the tower consisted of a cylinder composed of several cuboids, and the amphitheater and helipad both resembled cones. The tower was built around a concrete core and it had no walls but glass windows, which allowed for maximum natural lighting. It had the largest halls in eastern and central Africa.

A year prior in 1972, the World Bank approved funds for further expansion of the then Nairobi Airport (now Jomo Kenyatta International Airport), including a new international and domestic passenger terminal building, the airport&#x27;s first dedicated cargo and freight terminal, new taxiways, associated aprons, internal roads, car parks, police and fire stations, a State Pavilion, airfield and roadway lighting, fire hydrant system, water, electrical, telecommunications and sewage systems, a dual carriageway passenger access road, security, drainage and the building of the main access road to the airport (Airport South Road). The total cost of the project was more than US$29 million (US$111.8 million in 2013 dollars). On 14 March 1978, construction of the terminal building was completed on the other side of the airport&#x27;s single runway and opened by President Jomo Kenyatta less than five months before his death. The airport was renamed Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in memory of its first president.

The Giraffe Centre, an animal sanctuary on the southwestern outskirts of Nairobi, was opened in 1983. To this day, it breeds the endangered species of Rothschild&#x27;s giraffe.

The United States Embassy, then located in downtown Nairobi, was bombed in August 1998 by Al-Qaeda and the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, as one of a series of US embassy bombings. It is now the site of a memorial park.

===21st century===

On 20 October 2011, a memorial statue was unveiled in Nairobi in memory to Tom Mboya, a former Kenyan Independence politician and assassination victim.

On 9 November 2012, President Mwai Kibaki opened the KES 31 billion Thika Superhighway. This mega-project of Kenya started in 2009 and ended in 2011. It involved expanding the four-lane carriageway to eight lanes, building underpasses, providing interchanges at roundabouts, erecting flyovers and building underpasses to ease congestion. The 50.4-kilometre road was built in three phases: Uhuru Highway to Muthaiga Roundabout; Muthaiga Roundabout to Kenyatta University and; Kenyatta University to Thika Town.

On 31 May 2017, President Uhuru Kenyatta inaugurated the Standard Gauge Railway which connects Nairobi to Mombasa. It was primarily built by a Chinese firm with about 90% of total funding from China and about 10% from the Kenyan government. A second phase is also being built which will link Naivasha to the existing route and also the Uganda border.

On 11 August 2020, Nairobi County Assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi resigned. On 21 December 2020, recently elected Nairobi County Assembly Speaker Benson Mutura was sworn in as acting Nairobi Governor four days after the previous Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko was impeached and removed from office. At the time of Mutura&#x27;s swearing in as acting Governor, which he will hold for at least 60 days, Nairobi did not have a Deputy Governor as well.

=== Recent Developments ===
Nairobi has seen several major infrastructure projects in recent years. The Nairobi Expressway, completed in 2022, was developed to reduce traffic congestion along Mombasa Road. Additionally, the Green Park Bus Terminal, part of efforts to improve public transport, began operations in 2021. In line with the Kenyan government&#x27;s Affordable Housing Program, various housing developments are underway to accommodate the city&#x27;s growing population.

==Geography==
The city is situated at and and occupies .

Nairobi is situated between the cities of Kampala and Mombasa. As Nairobi is adjacent to the eastern edge of the Rift Valley, minor earthquakes and tremors occasionally occur. The Ngong Hills, located to the west of the city, are the most prominent geographical feature of the Nairobi area. Mount Kenya is situated north of Nairobi, and Mount Kilimanjaro is towards the south-east.

The Nairobi River and its tributaries traverse through the Nairobi County and joins the larger River Athi on the eastern edge of the county.

Nobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai fought fiercely to save the indigenous Karura Forest in northern Nairobi which was under threat of being replaced by housing and other infrastructure.

Nairobi&#x27;s western suburbs stretch all the way from the Kenyatta National Hospital in the south to the UN headquarters at Gigiri suburb in the north, a distance of about . The city is centred on the City Square, which is located in the Central Business District. The Kenyan Parliament buildings, the Holy Family Cathedral, Nairobi City Hall, Nairobi Law Courts, and the Kenyatta Convention Centre all surround the square.

===Climate===

Under the Köppen climate classification, Nairobi has a subtropical highland climate (Cwb). At above sea level, evenings may be cool, especially in the June/July season, when the temperature can drop to . The sunniest and warmest part of the year is from December to March, when temperatures average in the high-twenties Celsius during the day. The mean maximum temperature for this period is .

There are rainy seasons, but rainfall can be moderate. The cloudiest part of the year is just after the first rainy season, when, until September, conditions are usually overcast with drizzle. As Nairobi is situated close to the equator, the differences between the seasons are minimal. The seasons are referred to as the wet season and dry season. The timing of sunrise and sunset varies little throughout the year for the same reason.


===Nairobi metropolitan region===

Nairobi is found within the Greater Nairobi Metropolitan region, which consists of parts of 5 out of 47 counties in Kenya, which generate about 40% of the entire nation&#x27;s GDP as per 2022 data by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. Nairobi County on its contributes to 27.5% of the country&#x27;s GDP according to the same report while Kiambu county comes second with 5.9%.

===Districts and neighbourhoods===

Nairobi is divided into a series of constituencies with each being represented by members of Parliament in the National Assembly. The initial constituencies before the 2010 constitution which led to the county electoral boundaries being redrawn were: Makadara, Kamukunji, Starehe, Langata, Dagoretti, Westlands, Kasarani, and Embakasi. The new electoral boundaries after this were revised to Embakasi North, Embakasi South, Embakasi Central, Embakasi East, Embakasi West, Makadara, Kamukunji, Starehe, Mathare, Westlands, Dagoretti North, Dagoretti South, Langata, Kibra, Ruaraka, Roysambu and Kasarani. The main administrative divisions of Nairobi are Central, Dagoretti, Embakasi, Kasarani, Kibera, Makadara, Pumwani, and Westlands. Most of the upmarket suburbs are situated to the west and north-central of Nairobi, where most European settlers resided during the colonial times AKA &#x27;Ubabini&#x27;. These include Karen, Langata, Lavington, Gigiri, Muthaiga, Brookside, Spring Valley, Loresho, Kilimani, Kileleshwa, Hurlingham, Runda, Kitisuru, Nyari, Kyuna, Lower Kabete, Westlands, and Highridge, although Kangemi, Kawangware, and Dagoretti are lower income areas close to these affluent suburbs. The city&#x27;s colonial past is commemorated by many English place-names.

Most lower-middle and upper middle income neighbourhoods are located in the north-central areas such as Highridge, Parklands, Ngara, Pangani, and areas to the southwest and southeast of the metropolitan area near the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The most notable ones include Avenue Park, Fedha, Pipeline, Donholm, Greenfields, Nyayo, Taasia, Baraka, Nairobi West, Madaraka, Siwaka, South B, South C, Mugoya, Riverbank, Hazina, Buru Buru, Uhuru, Harambee Civil Servants&#x27;, Akiba, Kimathi, Pioneer, and Koma Rock to the centre-east and Kasarani to northeast area among others. The low and lower income estates are located mainly in far eastern Nairobi. These include, Umoja, Kariokor, Dandora, Kariobangi, Kayole, Ruai, Kamulu, Embakasi, and Huruma. Kitengela suburb, though located further southeast, Ongata Rongai and Kiserian further southwest, and Ngong/Embulbul suburbs also known as &#x27;Diaspora&#x27; to the far west are considered part of the Greater Nairobi Metropolitan area. More than 90% of Nairobi residents work within the Nairobi Metropolitan area, in the formal and informal sectors. Many Somali immigrants have also settled in Eastleigh, nicknamed &quot;Little Mogadishu&quot;. Here is the list of all postal codes for Nairobi .
====Kibera slum====

The Kibera slum in Nairobi is claimed by the Kenyan government to have a population of 185,777. However, non-governmental sources generally estimate the slum to have a population of 500,000 to 1,000,000, depending on what areas are defined as comprising Kibera.

===Parks and gardens===
Nairobi has many parks and open spaces throughout the city. Much of the city has dense tree-cover and plenty of green spaces. The most famous park in Nairobi is Uhuru Park. The park borders the central business district and the neighbourhood Upper Hill. Uhuru (&quot;Freedom&quot; in Swahili) Park is a centre for outdoor speeches, services, and rallies. The park was to be built over by former President Daniel arap Moi, who wanted the 62-storey headquarters of his party, the Kenya African National Union, situated in the park. However, the park was saved following a campaign by Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai.

Central Park is adjacent to Uhuru Park, and includes a memorial for Jomo Kenyatta, the first president of Kenya, and the Moi Monument, built in 1988 to commemorate the second president&#x27;s first decade in power. Other notable open spaces include Jeevanjee Gardens, City Park, 7 August Memorial Park, and Nairobi Arboretum.

The colonial 1948 Master Plan for Nairobi still acts as the governing mechanism when it comes to making decisions related to urban planning. The Master Plan at the time, which was designed for 250,000 people, allocated 28% of Nairobi&#x27;s land to public space, but because of rapid population growth, much of the vitality of public spaces within the city are increasingly threatened. City Park, the only natural park in Nairobi, for example, was originally , but has since lost approximately of land to private development through squatting and illegal alienation which began in the 1980s.

==Political divisions==

The City of Nairobi enjoys the status of a full administrative county.

Initially, Nairobi was one of the eight provinces in Kenya before 2013. The Nairobi province differed in several ways from other Kenyan regions. Nairobi Province was not divided into &quot;districts&quot; until 2007, when three districts were created. In 2010, along with the new constitution, Nairobi was renamed a county and consolidated into a city-county. The county is entirely urban. It had only one local council, Nairobi City Council which was replaced by Nairobi City County after the new constitution was effected in March 2013.

Nairobi County has 17 constituencies. Constituency name may differ from division name, such that Starehe Constituency is equal to Central Division, Lang&#x27;ata Constituency to Kibera division, and Kamukunji Constituency to Pumwani Division in terms of boundaries.

===Constituencies===
Nairobi is divided into 17 constituencies and 85 wards, mostly named after residential estates. Kibera Division, for example, includes Kibera (Kenya&#x27;s largest slum) as well as affluent estates of Karen and Langata.
The Nairobi GPO (General Post Office) Postal code is 00100

==Economy==
Nairobi is home to the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), one of Africa&#x27;s largest stock exchanges. The NSE was officially recognised as an overseas stock exchange by the London Stock Exchange in 1953. The exchange is Africa&#x27;s fourth largest in terms of trading volumes, and fifth largest in terms of Market Capitalization as a percentage of GDP.

Nairobi is the regional headquarters of several international companies and organisations. In 2007, General Electric, Young &amp; Rubicam, Google, Coca-Cola, IBM Services, and Cisco Systems relocated their African headquarters to the city. The United Nations Office at Nairobi hosts UN Environment and UN-Habitat headquarters.

Several of Africa&#x27;s largest companies are headquartered in Nairobi. Safaricom, the largest company in Kenya by assets and profitability is headquartered in Nairobi, KenGen, which is the largest African stock outside South Africa, is based in the city. Kenya Airways, Africa&#x27;s fourth largest airline, uses Nairobi&#x27;s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as a hub.

Nairobi has not been left behind by the FinTech phenomenon that has taken over worldwide. It has produced a couple of tech firms like Craft Silicon, Kangai Technologies, Jambo Pay and Hostraha Limited . which have been in the forefront of technology, innovation and cloud based computing services. Their products are widely used and have considerable market share presence within Kenya and outside its borders.

Goods manufactured in Nairobi include clothing, textiles, building materials, processed foods, beverages, and cigarettes. Several foreign companies have factories based in and around the city. These include Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, General Motors, Toyota, and The Coca-Cola Company.

Nairobi has a large tourist industry, being both a tourist destination and a transport hub.

===Central business district===
Nairobi has grown around its central business district. This takes a pentagonal shape, around the Uhuru Highway, Haile Selassie Avenue, Moi Avenue, and University Way. It features many of Nairobi&#x27;s important buildings, including the City Hall and Parliament Building. The city square is also located within the perimeter.

Most of the skyscrapers in this region are the headquarters of businesses and corporations, such as I&amp;M and the Kenyatta International Conference Centre. The United States Embassy bombing took place in this district, prompting the building of a new embassy building in the suburbs.

In 2011, the city was considered to have about 4 million residents. A large beautification project took place in the Central Business District, as the city prepared to host the 2006 Afri-Cities summit. Iconic buildings such as the Kenyatta International Conference Centre had their exteriors cleaned and repainted.

Nairobi downtown area or central business district is bordered to the southwest by Uhuru Park and Central Park. The Mombasa to Kampala railway runs to the southeast of the district.

===Upper Hill===
Two areas outside the Central Business District that are seeing growth in companies and office space are Upper Hill, which is located, approximately from the Central Business District and Westlands, about the same distance from the city centre.

Companies that have moved from the Central Business District to Upper Hill include Citibank, and in 2007 Coca-Cola began construction of their East and Central African headquarters in Upper Hill, cementing the district as the preferred location for office space in Nairobi. The largest office development in this area is UAP Tower, completed in 2015 and officially opened for business on 4 July 2016. It is a 33-storey tower 163 meters high. The World Bank and International Finance Corporation (part of the World Bank Group) are also located in Upper Hill at the Delta Center, Menegai Road. Earlier on, they were located in the Hill Park Building and CBA Building respectively (both also in Upper Hill), and prior to that in View Park towers in the Central Business District.

To accommodate the large demand for floor space in Nairobi, various commercial projects are being constructed. New business parks are being built in the city, including the flagship Nairobi Business Park.

==Demographics==
Nairobi has experienced one of the highest growth rates of any city in Africa. Since its foundation in 1899, Nairobi has grown to become the second largest city in the African Great Lakes, despite being one of youngest cities in the region. The growth rate of Nairobi was estimated in 2023 to be 2.09% a year. It is estimated that Nairobi&#x27;s population will reach 5 million people in 2025.

Given this high population growth, owing itself both to urban migration and high birth rates, the economy has yet to catch up. Unemployment is estimated at 5.5% within the city, mainly in the high-density, low-income areas of the city which can make them seem even denser than the higher-income neighbourhoods.

According to the 2019 Census, Christianity is the most widely practiced religion in Nairobi, accounting for 89% of the population, of which the majority belong to Protestant and Evangelical churches. Muslims make up a significant minority at 7.6% of the population.

A population projection in the 21st century is listed below:

Other recreational areas and protected forests include Uhuru Park, Central Park, John Michuki Park, Nairobi Arboretum, City Park, Uhuru Gardens, Jeevanjee Gardens, Karura Forest, Ngong forest, and Ololua forest.

== Culture ==
Nairobi is a diverse melting pot of African cultures. As a cosmopolitan African city, it hosts all the diverse tribes that make up Kenya, and hosts a large immigrant population from other African countries.

Nairobi has two informal nicknames. The first is &quot;The Green City in the Sun&quot;, which is derived from the city&#x27;s foliage and warm climate. The second is the &quot;Safari Capital of the World&quot;, which is used due to Nairobi&#x27;s prominence as a hub for safari tourism.

===Literature and film===
&quot;Kwani?&quot; is Kenya&#x27;s first literary journal and was established by writers living in Nairobi. Nairobi&#x27;s publishing houses have also produced the works of some of Kenya&#x27;s authors, including Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o and Meja Mwangi who were part of post-colonial writing.

Many film makers also practice their craft out of Nairobi. Film-making is still young in the country, but people like producer Njeri Karago and director Judy Kibinge are paving the way for others.

Perhaps the most famous book and film set in Nairobi is &quot;Out of Africa&quot;. The book was written by Karen Blixen, whose pseudonym was Isak Dinesen, and it is her account of living in Kenya. Karen Blixen lived in the Nairobi area from 1917 to 1931. The neighbourhood in which she lived, Karen, is named after her.

In 1985, &quot;Out of Africa&quot; was made into a film, directed by Sydney Pollack. The film won 28 awards, including seven Academy Awards. The popularity of the film prompted the opening of Nairobi&#x27;s Karen Blixen Museum.

Nairobi is also the setting of many of the novels of Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o, Kenya&#x27;s foremost writer.

Nairobi has been the set of several other American and British films. The most recent of these was &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot; (2005), a large part of which was filmed in the city. The story revolves around a British diplomat in Nairobi whose wife is murdered in northern Kenya. Much of the filming was in the Kibera slum.

Among the latest Kenyan actors in Hollywood who identify with Nairobi is Lupita Nyong&#x27;o. Lupita received an Oscar award for best supporting actress in her role as Patsy in the film &quot;12 Years a Slave&quot; during the &quot;86th Academy Awards&quot; at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles. Lupita is the daughter of Kenyan politician Peter Anyang&#x27; Nyong&#x27;o.

Most new Hollywood films are nowadays screened at Nairobi&#x27;s cinemas. Up until the early 1990s, there were only a few film theatres and the repertoire was limited. There are also two drive-in cinemas in Nairobi.

In 2015 and 2016, Nairobi was the focus point for the American television series &quot;Sense8&quot; which shot its first and second seasons partly in the city. The TV series has high reviews in The Internet Movie Database (IMDb).

In 2015 Nairobi was also featured in the British thriller film &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot;, which is a story about a lieutenant general and a colonel who faced political opposition after ordering a drone missile strike to take out a group of suicide bombers in Nairobi.

In 2017, the name &quot;Nairobi&quot; was taken as a code-name by a female main character in the famous Spanish TV series &quot;Money Heist&quot;.

===Food===
In Nairobi, there are a range of restaurants. Besides being home to &quot;nyama choma&quot; which is a local term used to refer to roasted meat, there are American fast food restaurants such as KFC, Subway, Domino&#x27;s Pizza, Pizza Hut, Hardee&#x27;s and Burger King, and the longer established South African chains, Galito&#x27;s, Steers, PizzaMojo, and Spur Steak Ranches. Coffee houses, doubling up as restaurants and mostly frequented by the upper middle classes, such as Artcaffe Nairobi Java House and Dormans, have become increasingly popular in recent days. Traditional food joints such as the popular K&#x27;osewe&#x27;s in the city centre and Amaica, which specialize in African delicacies, are also widespread. The Kenchic franchise which specialized in old-school chicken and chips meals was also popular, particularly among the lower classes and students, with restaurants all over the city and its suburbs. However, as of February 2016, Kenchic stopped operating its eatery business. Upscale restaurants often specialize in specific cuisines such as Italian, Lebanese, Ethiopian, and French, but are more likely to be found in five star hotels and the wealthier suburbs in the West and South of the city.

Nairobi has an annual restaurant week (NRW) at the beginning of the year, January–February. Nairobi&#x27;s restaurants offer dining packages at reduced prices. NRW is managed by Eatout Kenya which is an online platform that lists and reviews restaurants in Nairobi, and provides a platform for Kenyan foodies to congregate and share.

==Infrastructure==
===Transport===

Major plans are being implemented in the need to decongest the city&#x27;s traffic and the completion of Thika Road has given the city a much needed face-lift attributed to road&#x27;s enhancement of global standards. Several projects have been completed (Syokimau Rail Station, the Eastern and Northern Bypasses) while numerous other projects are still underway.

The development of these critical transport facilities will, besides reducing transport costs due to faster movement of goods and people within the region, also increase trade, improve the socio-economic welfare of Northern Kenya and boost the country&#x27;s potential in attracting investments from all over the world.

====Airports====

Jomo Kenyatta International Airport is the largest airport in Kenya. Domestic travelers made up 40% of overall passengers in 2016. An increase of 32% in 5 yrs since 2012. JKIA had more than 7 million passengers going through it in 2016. In February 2017, JKIA received a Category One Status from the FAA boosting the airport&#x27;s status as a Regional Aviation hub.

Wilson Airport is a general-aviation airport handling smaller aircraft, mostly propeller-driven. In July 2016, construction of a new air traffic control Tower commenced at a cost of KES 163 million (approximately US$1.63 million).

Moi Air Base is a military airport. In its earlier years, it was utilised as a landing strip in the pre-jet airline era. It was mostly used as a British passenger and mail route from Southampton to Cape Town in the 1930s &amp; 1940s. This route was served by flying boats between Britain and Kisumu and then by land-based aircraft on the routes to the south.

====Matatu====
Matatus are the most common form of public transport in Nairobi. Matatu, which literally translates to &quot;three cents for a ride&quot; (nowadays much more) are privately owned minibuses. They generally seat fourteen to thirty three. Matatus operate within Nairobi, its environs and suburbs and from Nairobi to other towns around the country. The matatu&#x27;s route is imprinted along a yellow stripe on the side of the bus, and matatus plying specific routes have specific route numbers.However, in 2004, a law was passed requiring all matatus to include seat belts and speed governors and to be painted with a yellow stripe. At first, this caused a furore amongst Matatu operators, but they were pressured by government and the public to make the changes. Matatus are now limited to .

However, in November 2014 President Uhuru Kenyatta lifted the ban on the yellow stripe and allowed matatus to maintain the colourful graphics in an effort to support the youth in creating employment. Matatus in Nairobi were easily distinguishable by their extravagant paint schemes, as owners would paint their matatu with various colourful decorations, such as their favourite football team or hip hop artist. They are notorious for their poor safety records, which are a result of overcrowding and reckless driving. Due to the intense competition between matatus, many are equipped with powerful sound systems and television screens to attract more customers.

====Buses====

Buses are increasingly becoming common in the city with some even going to the extents of installing complimentary WiFi systems in partnership with the leading mobile service provider. There are four major bus companies operating the city routes and are the traditional Kenya Bus Service (KBS), and newer private operators Citi Hoppa, Compliant MOA and Double M. The Citi Hoppa buses are distinguishable by their green livery, the Double M buses are painted purple, Compliant MOA by their distinctively screaming names and mix of white, blue colours while the KBS buses are painted blue.

Companies such as Easy Coach, Crown Bus, Coast Bus, Modern Coast, Eldoret Express, Chania, the Guardian Angel, Spanish and Mash Poa run scheduled buses and luxury coaches to other cities and towns.

A Bus rapid transit will commence operating with 100 high capacity buses along Thika Road in July 2022 between Kasarani and the Kenyatta National Hospital. After the pilot, Nairobi Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (Namata) will implement another 300 buses as the first phase that will expand the BRT line to run from Ruiru to Kenyatta National Hospital. A second phase will later extend the line to run between Kenol in Murang&#x27;a County to Ongata Rongai in Kajiado County.

====Trains====

Nairobi was founded as a railway town, and the main headquarters of Kenya Railways (KR) is still situated at Nairobi railway station, which is located near the city centre. The line runs through Nairobi, from Mombasa to Kampala. Its main use is freight traffic connecting Nairobi to Mombasa and Kisumu. A number of morning and evening commuter trains connect the centre with the suburbs, but the city has no proper light rail, tramway, or rapid transit lines. A proposal has been passed for the construction of a commuter rail line. The country&#x27;s third president since independence, President Mwai Kibaki on Tuesday, 13 November 2012 launched the Syokimau Rail Service marking a major milestone in the history of railway development in the country. The opening of the station marked another milestone in efforts to realise various projects envisaged under the Vision 2030 Economic Blueprint. The new station has a train that ferries passengers from Syokimau to the city centre cutting travel time by half. Opening of the station marks the completion of the first phase of the Sh24b Nairobi Commuter Rail Network that is geared at easing traffic congestion in Nairobi, blamed for huge economic losses. Other modern stations include Imara Daima Railway Station and Makadara Railway Station.

The new Mombasa–Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway connects the port city of Mombasa and Nairobi. The new railway line has virtually replaced the old metre-gauge railway. The Nairobi Terminus is located at Syokimau, some 20 km from the city centre. Passengers travelling from Mombasa are transferred the short distance into the CBD with the metre-gauge trains.

====Roads====
Two trans-African automobile routes pass through Nairobi: the Cairo-Cape Town Highway and the Lagos-Mombasa Highway. Nairobi is served by highways that link Mombasa to Kampala in Uganda and Arusha in Tanzania. These are earmarked to ease the daily motor traffic within and surrounding the metro area. However, driving in Nairobi is chaotic. Most of the roads are tarmacked and there are signs showing directions to certain neighbourhoods. The city is connected to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport by the Mombasa Highway, which passes through Industrial Area, South B, South C and Embakasi. Ongata Rongai, Langata and Karen are connected to the city centre by Langata Road, which runs to the south. Lavington, Riverside, and Westlands are connected by Waiyaki Way. Kasarani, Eastlands, and Embakasi are connected by Thika Road, Jogoo Road, and Outer Ring Road.

Highways connect the city with other major towns such as Mombasa, Machakos, Voi, (A109), Eldoret, Kisumu, Nakuru, Naivasha, and Namanga Border Tanzania (A104).

Nairobi is undergoing major road constructions to update its infrastructure network. The new system of roads, flyovers, and bridges are intended to better cope with high traffic levels. It is also a major component of Kenya&#x27;s Vision 2030 and Nairobi Metropolis plans. Most roads now are well lit and surfaced with adequate signage.

In 2020, the construction of The Nairobi Expressway began. The Nairobi expressway is a 27 km toll road connecting the Eastern Nairobi neighbourhood of Mulolongo to the uptown neighbourhood of Westlands at James Gichuru junction through Nairobi CBD. The road is directly to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport enabling travellers to access the airport faster avoiding the heavy traffic on Mombasa Road and Waiyaki Way. The road has an 11.025 km elevated section between Airtel Center and Westlands.

This road, is intended to ease traffic from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport that accesses Nairobi city center. Also traffic from Central Nairobi is expected to be facilitated, to reduce the number of departing passengers who miss their fights, while stuck in road traffic jams on the city streets.[5] The work involves expansion of the existing road to four-lanes one-way, (8 lanes total), with foot paths, drainage channels, overpass bridges and street lighting. It was opened to the public in May 2022.

====Private car population projection for Nairobi====
===Water supply and sanitation===

94% of the piped water supply for Nairobi comes from rivers and reservoirs in the Aberdare Range north of the city, of which the reservoir of the Thika Dam is the most important one. Water distribution losses – technically called non-revenue water – are 40%, and only 40% of those with house connections receive water continuously. Slum residents receive water through water kiosks and end up paying much higher water prices than those fortunate enough to have access to piped water at their residence.

===Housing===
There is a wide variety of housing options in Nairobi. The options range from privately owned housing units/apartments, rented units, leased spaces and even houses on mortgage. Most wealthy Kenyans live in Nairobi, but the majority of Nairobians are of average and low income. Half of the population has been estimated to live in slums which cover just 5% of the city area. The growth of these slums is a result of urbanisation, poor town planning, lack of good governance and proper leadership in these settlements and lack of empowerment and social capital among other factors.
Kibera is one of the largest slums in Africa, and is situated to the west of Nairobi. (Kibera comes from the Nubian word Kibra, meaning &quot;forest&quot; or &quot;jungle&quot;). The slums cover two square kilometres and are on government land. Kibera has been the setting for several films, the most recent being &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot;.

Other notable slums include Mathare and Korogocho. Altogether, 66 areas are counted as slums within Nairobi.

Many Nairobi non-slum-dwellers live in relatively good housing conditions. Large houses can be found in many of the upmarket neighbourhoods, especially to the west of Nairobi. Middle and high income estates include Gigiri, Muthaiga, Langata and Karen. Other middle and high income estates include Parklands, Westlands, Hurlingham, Kilimani, Milimani, Spring Valley, Lavington, Rosslyn, Kitisuru, and Nairobi Hill.

To accommodate the growing middle class, many new apartments and housing developments are being built in and around the city. The most notable development is &quot;Greenpark&quot;, at Athi River, Machakos County from Nairobi&#x27;s Central Business District. Over 5,000 houses, villas and apartments are being constructed at this development, including leisure, retail and commercial facilities. The development is being marketed to families, as are most others within the city. Eastlands also houses most of the city&#x27;s middle class and includes South C, South B, Embakasi, Buru Buru, Komarock, Donholm, Umoja, and various others.

==Crime and law enforcement==
Crime levels and safety have very much improved in Nairobi over recent years. Violent crime is rare but petty crime can still be an issue. In general, petty crime in Nairobi mostly involves pickpocketing and theft, and on rare occasions can be confrontational. Although there have been a handful of isolated attacks in Kenya by Al Shaabab from neighbouring Somalia, these incidences are rare.

==Media==
Nairobi is home to most of Kenya&#x27;s news and media organisations. The city is also home to the region&#x27;s largest newspapers: the &quot;Daily Nation&quot; and &quot;The Standard&quot;. These are circulated within Kenya and cover a range of domestic and regional issues. Both newspapers are published in English. People Daily is also the leading free newspaper distributed on the streets of Nairobi. It is published by Mediamax Limited.

Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, a state-run television and radio station, is headquartered in the city. Kenya Television Network is part of the Standard Group and was Kenya&#x27;s first privately owned TV station. The Nation Media Group runs NTV which is based in Nairobi, The Royal Media Services (RMS). There are also a number of prominent radio stations located in Kenya&#x27;s capital including Citizen radio, Inooro fm, KISS 100, Capital FM, East FM, Kameme FM, Metro FM, and Family FM, among others.

Several multinational media organisations have their regional headquarters in Nairobi. These include the BBC, CNN, Agence France-Presse, Reuters, Deutsche Welle, and the Associated Press. The East African bureau of CNBC Africa is located in Nairobi&#x27;s city centre, while the Nairobi bureau of &quot;The New York Times&quot; is located in the suburb of Gigiri. The broadcast headquarters of CCTV Africa are located in Nairobi.

== Pop culture ==
&quot;Rise and Fall of Idi Amin&quot;, also referred to as, &quot;Amin: The Rise and Fall&quot;, is a 1981 biographical film by Sharad Patel. The movie details the controversial actions and atrocities of the once dictator of Uganda, Idi Amin, in the time of his violent rise to power in 1971 until he descends in 1979 as the result of Uganda–Tanzania uprising. The movie depicts some of the roles Nairobi as the political hub of Kenya served in opposing the Ugandan dictator, including the coordination between Tel Aviv and Nairobi during operation Entebe.

In 2012, a Kenyan drama film directed by David &quot;Tosh&quot; Gitonga named &quot;Nairobi Half Life&quot; came to the big screen. The film was selected as the Kenyan entry for the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards, but did not make the final shortlist, and is the first time Kenya has submitted a film in this category.

Nairobi inspired the nicknaming of the character Ágata Jiménez as &#x27;Nairobi&#x27;; a fictional character in the Netflix series &quot;Money Heist&quot;, portrayed by Alba Flores. She serves as the quality manager of the group, in charge of printing money in the Royal Mint of Spain in parts 1 and 2, and overseeing the melting of gold in the Bank of Spain in parts 3 and 4. She is widely considered to be the show&#x27;s most popular character.

==Twin towns and sister cities==

Nairobi is twinned with:

* Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
* Cape Town, South Africa
* Denver, United States
* Kunming, China
* Lowell, United States
* Raleigh, United States
* São Luís, Brazil

<text>In linguistics, a numeral in the broadest sense is a word or phrase that describes a numerical quantity. Some theories of grammar use the word &quot;numeral&quot; to refer to cardinal numbers that act as a determiner that specify the quantity of a noun, for example the &quot;two&quot; in &quot;two hats&quot;. Some theories of grammar do not include determiners as a part of speech and consider &quot;two&quot; in this example to be an adjective. Some theories consider &quot;numeral&quot; to be a synonym for &quot;number&quot; and assign all numbers (including ordinal numbers like &quot;first&quot;) to a part of speech called &quot;numerals&quot;. Numerals in the broad sense can also be analyzed as a noun (&quot;three is a small number&quot;), as a pronoun (&quot;the two went to town&quot;), or for a small number of words as an adverb (&quot;I rode the slide twice&quot;).

Numerals can express relationships like quantity (cardinal numbers), sequence (ordinal numbers), frequency (once, twice), and part (fraction).

==Identifying numerals==

Numerals may be attributive, as in &quot;two dogs&quot;, or pronominal, as in &quot;I saw two (of them)&quot;.

Many words of different parts of speech indicate number or quantity. Such words are called quantifiers. Examples are words such as &quot;every&quot;, &quot;most&quot;, &quot;least&quot;, &quot;some&quot;, etc. Numerals are distinguished from other quantifiers by the fact that they designate a specific number. Examples are words such as &quot;five, ten, fifty, one hundred, etc.&quot; They may or may not be treated as a distinct part of speech; this may vary, not only with the language, but with the choice of word. For example, &quot;dozen&quot; serves the function of a noun, &quot;first&quot; serves the function of an adjective, and &quot;twice&quot; serves the function of an adverb. In Old Church Slavonic, the cardinal numbers 5 to 10 were feminine nouns; when quantifying a noun, that noun was declined in the genitive plural like other nouns that followed a noun of quantity (one would say the equivalent of &quot;five of people&quot;). In English grammar, the classification &quot;numeral&quot; (viewed as a part of speech) is reserved for those words which have distinct grammatical behavior: when a numeral modifies a noun, it may replace the article: the/some dogs played in the park&quot; → twelve dogs played in the park&quot;. (*&quot;dozen dogs played in the park&quot; is not grammatical, so &quot;dozen&quot; is not a numeral in this sense.) English numerals indicate cardinal numbers. However, not all words for cardinal numbers are necessarily numerals. For example, &quot;million&quot; is grammatically a noun, and must be preceded by an article or numeral itself.

Numerals may be simple, such as &#x27;eleven&#x27;, or compound, such as &#x27;twenty-three&#x27;.

In linguistics, however, numerals are classified according to purpose: examples are ordinal numbers (&quot;first&quot;, &quot;second&quot;, &quot;third&quot;, etc.; from &#x27;third&#x27; up, these are also used for fractions), multiplicative (adverbial) numbers (&quot;once&quot;, &quot;twice&quot;, and &quot;thrice&quot;), multipliers (&quot;single&quot;, &quot;double&quot;, and &quot;triple&quot;), and distributive numbers (&quot;singly&quot;, &quot;doubly&quot;, and &quot;triply&quot;). Georgian, Latin, and Romanian (see Romanian distributive numbers) have regular distributive numbers, such as Latin &quot;one-by-one&quot;, &quot;in pairs, two-by-two&quot;, &quot;three each&quot;, etc. In languages other than English, there may be other kinds of number words. For example, in Slavic languages there are collective numbers (monad, pair/dyad, triad) which describe sets, such as &quot;pair&quot; or &quot;dozen&quot; in English (see Russian numerals, Polish numerals).

Some languages have a very limited set of numerals, and in some cases they arguably do not have any numerals at all, but instead use more generic quantifiers, such as &#x27;pair&#x27; or &#x27;many&#x27;. However, by now most such languages have borrowed the numeral system or part of the numeral system of a national or colonial language, though in a few cases (such as Guarani), a numeral system has been invented internally rather than borrowed. Other languages had an indigenous system but borrowed a second set of numerals anyway. An example is Japanese, which uses either native or Chinese-derived numerals depending on what is being counted.

In many languages, such as Chinese, numerals require the use of numeral classifiers. Many sign languages, such as ASL, incorporate numerals.

==Larger numerals==
English has derived numerals for multiples of its base (&quot;fifty, sixty,&quot; etc.), and some languages have simplex numerals for these, or even for numbers between the multiples of its base. Balinese, for example, currently has a decimal system, with words for 10, 100, and 1000, but has additional simplex numerals for 25 (with a second word for 25 only found in a compound for 75), 35, 45, 50, 150, 175, 200 (with a second found in a compound for 1200), 400, 900, and 1600. In Hindustani, the numerals between 10 and 100 have developed to the extent that they need to be learned independently.

In many languages, numerals up to the base are a distinct part of speech, while the words for powers of the base belong to one of the other word classes. In English, these higher words are hundred 102, thousand 103, million 106, and higher powers of a thousand (short scale) or of a million (long scale—see names of large numbers). These words cannot modify a noun without being preceded by an article or numeral (*&quot;hundred dogs played in the park&quot;), and so are nouns.

In East Asia, the higher units are hundred, thousand, myriad 104, and powers of myriad. In the Indian subcontinent, they are hundred, thousand, lakh 105, crore 107, and so on. The Mesoamerican system, still used to some extent in Mayan languages, was based on powers of 20: &quot;bak’&quot; 400 (202), &quot;pik&quot; 8000 (203), &quot;kalab&quot; 160,000 (204), etc.

== Numerals of cardinal numbers ==
The cardinal numbers have numerals. In the following tables, [and] indicates that the word &quot;and&quot; is used in some dialects (such as British English), and omitted in other dialects (such as American English).

This table demonstrates the standard English construction of some cardinal numbers. (See next table for names of larger cardinals.)

=== English names for powers of 10 ===
This table compares the English names of cardinal numbers according to various American, British, and Continental European conventions. See English numerals or names of large numbers for more information on naming numbers.

There is no consistent and widely accepted way to extend cardinals beyond centillion (centilliard).

=== Myriad, Octad, and -yllion systems ===
The following table details the myriad, octad, Ancient Greek Archimedes&#x27;s notation, Chinese myriad, Chinese long and -yllion names for powers of 10.

There is also a Knuth-proposed system notation of numbers, named the -yllion system. In this system, a new word is invented for every &quot;2n&quot;-th power of ten. 

== Fractional numerals==
This is a table of English names for non-negative rational numbers less than or equal to 1. It also lists alternative names, but there is no widespread convention for the names of extremely small positive numbers.

Keep in mind that rational numbers like 0.12 can be represented in infinitely many ways, e.g. &quot;zero-point-one-two&quot; (0.12), &quot;twelve percent&quot; (12%), &quot;three twenty-fifths&quot; (), &quot;nine seventy-fifths&quot; (), &quot;six fiftieths&quot; (), &quot;twelve hundredths&quot; (), &quot;twenty-four two-hundredths&quot; (), etc.
== Other specific quantity terms ==

Various terms have arisen to describe commonly used measured quantities.
* Unit: 1 (based on a single entity of counting or measurement of an object or item)
* Pair: 2 (the base of the binary numeral system)
* Leash: 3 (the base of the trinary numeral system)
* Dozen: 12 (the base of the duodecimal numeral system)
* Baker&#x27;s dozen: 13 (based on a group of thirteen objects or items)
* Score: 20 (the base of the vigesimal numeral system)
* Shock: 60 (the base of the sexagesimal numeral system)
* Gross: (based on a group of 144 objects or items)
* Great gross: (based on a group of 1,728 objects or items)

==Basis of counting system==
Not all peoples use counting, at least not verbally. Specifically, there is not much need for counting among hunter-gatherers who do not engage in commerce. Many languages around the world have no numerals above two to four (if they are actually numerals at all, and not some other part of speech)—or at least did not before contact with the colonial societies—and speakers of these languages may have no tradition of using the numerals they did have for counting. Indeed, several languages from the Amazon have been independently reported to have no specific number words other than &#x27;one&#x27;. These include Nadëb, pre-contact Mocoví and Pilagá, Culina and pre-contact Jarawara, Jabutí, Canela-Krahô, Botocudo (Krenák), Chiquitano, the Campa languages, Arabela, and Achuar. Some languages of Australia, such as Warlpiri, do not have words for quantities above two, and neither did many Khoisan languages at the time of European contact. Such languages do not have a word class of &#x27;numeral&#x27;.

Most languages with both numerals and counting use base 8, 10, 12, or 20. Base 10 appears to come from counting one&#x27;s fingers, base 20 from the fingers and toes, base 8 from counting the spaces between the fingers (attested in California), and base 12 from counting the knuckles (3 each for the four fingers).

===No base===
Many languages of Melanesia have (or once had) counting systems based on parts of the body which do not have a numeric base; there are (or were) no numerals, but rather nouns for relevant parts of the body—or simply pointing to the relevant spots—were used for quantities. For example, 1–4 may be the fingers, 5 &#x27;thumb&#x27;, 6 &#x27;wrist&#x27;, 7 &#x27;elbow&#x27;, 8 &#x27;shoulder&#x27;, etc., across the body and down the other arm, so that the opposite little finger represents a number between 17 (Torres Islands) to 23 (Eleman). For numbers beyond this, the torso, legs and toes may be used, or one might count back up the other arm and back down the first, depending on the people.

===2: binary===

Binary systems are based on the number 2, using zeros and ones. Due to its simplicity, only having two distinct digits, binary is commonly used in computing, with zero and one often corresponding to &quot;off/on&quot; respectively.

===3: ternary===

Ternary systems are based on the number 3, having practical usage in some analog logic, in baseball scoring and in self–similar mathematical structures.

===4: quaternary===

Quaternary systems are based on the number 4. Some Austronesian, Melanesian, Sulawesi, and Papua New Guinea ethnic groups, count with the base number four, using the term &quot;asu&quot; or &quot;aso&quot;, the word for dog, as the ubiquitous village dog has four legs. This is argued by anthropologists to be also based on early humans noting the human and animal shared body feature of two arms and two legs as well as its ease in simple arithmetic and counting. As an example of the system&#x27;s ease a realistic scenario could include a farmer returning from the market with fifty &quot;asu&quot; heads of pig (200), less 30 &quot;asu&quot; (120) of pig bartered for 10 &quot;asu&quot; (40) of goats noting his new pig count total as twenty &quot;asu&quot;: 80 pigs remaining. The system has a correlation to the dozen counting system and is still in common use in these areas as a natural and easy method of simple arithmetic.

===5: quinary===

Quinary systems are based on the number 5. It is almost certain the quinary system developed from counting by fingers (five fingers per hand). An example are the Epi languages of Vanuatu, where 5 is &quot;luna&quot; &#x27;hand&#x27;, 10 &quot;lua-luna&quot; &#x27;two hand&#x27;, 15 &quot;tolu-luna&quot; &#x27;three hand&#x27;, etc. 11 is then &quot;lua-luna tai&quot; &#x27;two-hand one&#x27;, and 17 &quot;tolu-luna lua&quot; &#x27;three-hand two&#x27;.

5 is a common &quot;auxiliary base&quot;, or &quot;sub-base&quot;, where 6 is &#x27;five and one&#x27;, 7 &#x27;five and two&#x27;, etc. Aztec was a vigesimal (base-20) system with sub-base 5.

===6: senary===

Senary systems are based on the number 6. The Morehead-Maro languages of Southern New Guinea are examples of the rare base 6 system with monomorphemic words running up to 66. Examples are Kanum and Kómnzo. The Sko languages on the North Coast of New Guinea follow a base-24 system with a sub-base of 6.

===7: septenary===
Septenary systems are based on the number 7. Septenary systems are very rare, as few natural objects consistently have seven distinctive features. Traditionally, it occurs in week-related timing. It has been suggested that the Palikúr language has a base-seven system, but this is dubious.

===8: octal===

Octal systems are based on the number 8. Examples can be found in the Yuki language of California and in the Pamean languages of Mexico, because the Yuki and Pame keep count by using the four spaces between their fingers rather than the fingers themselves.

===9: nonary===
Nonary systems are based on the number 9. It has been suggested that Nenets has a base-nine system.

===10: decimal===

Decimal systems are based on the number 10. A majority of traditional number systems are decimal. This dates back at least to the ancient Egyptians, who used a wholly decimal system. Anthropologists hypothesize this may be due to humans having five digits per hand, ten in total. There are many regional variations including:

* Western system: based on thousands, with variants (see English numerals)
* Indian system: crore, lakh (see Indian numbering system. Indian numerals)
* East Asian system: based on ten-thousands (see below)

===12: duodecimal===

Duodecimal systems are based on the number 12.

These include:

* Chepang language of Nepal,
* Mahl language of Minicoy Island in India
* Nigerian Middle Belt areas such as Janji, Kahugu and the Nimbia dialect of Gwandara.
* Melanesia
* reconstructed proto-Benue–Congo

Duodecimal numeric systems have some practical advantages over decimal. It is much easier to divide the base digit twelve (which is a highly composite number) by many important divisors in market and trade settings, such as the numbers 2, 3, 4 and 6.

Because of several measurements based on twelve, many Western languages have words for base-twelve units such as &quot;dozen&quot;, &quot;gross&quot; and &quot;great gross&quot;, which allow for rudimentary duodecimal nomenclature, such as &quot;two gross six dozen&quot; for 360. Ancient Romans used a decimal system for integers, but switched to duodecimal for fractions, and correspondingly Latin developed a rich vocabulary for duodecimal-based fractions (see Roman numerals). A notable fictional duodecimal system was that of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Elvish languages, which used duodecimal as well as decimal.

===16: hexadecimal===

Hexadecimal systems are based on the number 16.

The traditional Chinese units of measurement were base-16. For example, one jīn (斤) in the old system equals sixteen taels. The suanpan (Chinese abacus) can be used to perform hexadecimal calculations such as additions and subtractions.

South Asian monetary systems were base-16. One rupee in Pakistan and India was divided into 16 annay. A single anna was subdivided into four paisa or twelve pies (thus there were 64 paise or 192 pies in a rupee). The anna was demonetised as a currency unit when India decimalised its currency in 1957, followed by Pakistan in 1961.

===20: vigesimal===

Vigesimal systems are based on the number 20. Anthropologists are convinced the system originated from digit counting, as did bases five and ten, twenty being the number of human fingers and toes combined.
The system is in widespread use across the world. Some include the classical Mesoamerican cultures, still in use today in the modern indigenous languages of their descendants, namely the Nahuatl and Mayan languages (see Maya numerals). A modern national language which uses a full vigesimal system is Dzongkha in Bhutan.

Partial vigesimal systems are found in some European languages: Basque, Celtic languages, French (from Celtic), Danish, and Georgian. In these languages the systems are vigesimal up to 99, then decimal from 100 up. That is, 140 is &#x27;one hundred two score&#x27;, not *seven score, and there is no numeral for 400 (great score).

The term &quot;score&quot; originates from tally sticks, and is perhaps a remnant of Celtic vigesimal counting. It was widely used to learn the pre-decimal British currency in this idiom: &quot;a dozen pence and a score of bob&quot;, referring to the 20 shillings in a pound. For Americans the term is most known from the opening of the Gettysburg Address: &quot;Four score and seven years ago our fathers...&quot;.

===24: quadrovigesimal===
Quadrovigesimal systems are based on the number 24. The Sko languages have a base-24 system with a sub-base of 6.

===32: duotrigesimal===

Duotrigesimal systems are based on the number 32. The Ngiti ethnolinguistic group uses a base 32 numeral system.

===60: sexagesimal===

Sexagesimal systems are based on the number 60. Ekari has a base-60 system. Sumeria had a base-60 system with a decimal sub-base (with alternating cycles of 10 and 6), which was the origin of the numbering of modern degrees, minutes, and seconds.

===80: octogesimal===
Octogesimal systems are based on the number 80. Supyire is said to have a base-80 system; it counts in twenties (with 5 and 10 as sub-bases) up to 80, then by eighties up to 400, and then by 400s (great scores).

799 [i.e. 400 + (4 x 80) + (3 x 20) + {10 + (5 + 4)}]’

<text>A neutrino ( ; denoted by the Greek letter ) is an elementary particle that interacts via the weak interaction and gravity. The neutrino is so named because it is electrically neutral and because its rest mass is so small (&quot;-ino&quot;) that it was long thought to be zero. The rest mass of the neutrino is much smaller than that of the other known elementary particles (excluding massless particles). The weak force has a very short range, the gravitational interaction is extremely weak due to the very small mass of the neutrino, and neutrinos do not participate in the electromagnetic interaction or the strong interaction. Thus, neutrinos typically pass through normal matter unimpeded and undetected.

Weak interactions create neutrinos in one of three leptonic flavors:
# electron neutrino, 
# muon neutrino, 
# tau neutrino, 

Each flavor is associated with the correspondingly named charged lepton. Although neutrinos were long believed to be massless, it is now known that there are three discrete neutrino masses with different values (all tiny, the smallest of which could be zero), but the three masses do not uniquely correspond to the three flavors: A neutrino created with a specific flavor is a specific mixture of all three mass states (a &quot;quantum superposition&quot;). Similar to some other neutral particles, neutrinos oscillate between different flavors in flight as a consequence. For example, an electron neutrino produced in a beta decay reaction may interact in a distant detector as a muon or tau neutrino. The three mass values are not yet known as of 2024, but laboratory experiments and cosmological observations have determined the differences of their squares, an upper limit on their sum (&lt; ), and an upper limit on the mass of the electron neutrino. Neutrinos are fermions, which have spin of.

For each neutrino, there also exists a corresponding antiparticle, called an &quot;antineutrino&quot;, which also has spin of and no electric charge. Antineutrinos are distinguished from neutrinos by having opposite-signed lepton number and weak isospin, and right-handed instead of left-handed chirality. To conserve total lepton number (in nuclear beta decay), electron neutrinos only appear together with positrons (anti-electrons) or electron-antineutrinos, whereas electron antineutrinos only appear with electrons or electron neutrinos.

Neutrinos are created by various radioactive decays; the following list is not exhaustive, but includes some of those processes:
* beta decay of atomic nuclei or hadrons
* natural nuclear reactions such as those that take place in the core of a star
* artificial nuclear reactions in nuclear reactors, nuclear bombs, or particle accelerators
* during a supernova
* during the spin-down of a neutron star
* when cosmic rays or accelerated particle beams strike atoms

The majority of neutrinos which are detected about the Earth are from nuclear reactions inside the Sun. At the surface of the Earth, the flux is about 65 billion () solar neutrinos, per second per square centimeter. Neutrinos can be used for tomography of the interior of the Earth.

== History ==

=== Pauli&#x27;s proposal ===
The neutrino was postulated first by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930 to explain how beta decay could conserve energy, momentum, and angular momentum (spin). In contrast to Niels Bohr, who proposed a statistical version of the conservation laws to explain the observed continuous energy spectra in beta decay, Pauli hypothesized an undetected particle that he called a &quot;neutron&quot;, using the same &quot;-on&quot; ending employed for naming both the proton and the electron. He considered that the new particle was emitted from the nucleus together with the electron or beta particle in the process of beta decay and had a mass similar to the electron.

James Chadwick discovered a much more massive neutral nuclear particle in 1932 and named it a neutron also, leaving two kinds of particles with the same name. The word &quot;neutrino&quot; entered the scientific vocabulary through Enrico Fermi, who used it during a conference in Paris in July 1932 and at the Solvay Conference in October 1933, where Pauli also employed it. The name (the Italian equivalent of &quot;little neutral one&quot;) was jokingly coined by Edoardo Amaldi during a conversation with Fermi at the Institute of Physics of via Panisperna in Rome, in order to distinguish this light neutral particle from Chadwick&#x27;s heavy neutron.

In Fermi&#x27;s theory of beta decay, Chadwick&#x27;s large neutral particle could decay to a proton, electron, and the smaller neutral particle (now called an &quot;electron antineutrino&quot;):

Fermi&#x27;s paper, written in 1934, unified Pauli&#x27;s neutrino with Paul Dirac&#x27;s positron and Werner Heisenberg&#x27;s neutron–proton model and gave a solid theoretical basis for future experimental work.

By 1934, there was experimental evidence against Bohr&#x27;s idea that energy conservation is invalid for beta decay: At the Solvay conference of that year, measurements of the energy spectra of beta particles (electrons) were reported, showing that there is a strict limit on the energy of electrons from each type of beta decay. Such a limit is not expected if the conservation of energy is invalid, in which case any amount of energy would be statistically available in at least a few decays. The natural explanation of the beta decay spectrum as first measured in 1934 was that only a limited (and conserved) amount of energy was available, and a new particle was sometimes taking a varying fraction of this limited energy, leaving the rest for the beta particle. Pauli made use of the occasion to publicly emphasize that the still-undetected &quot;neutrino&quot; must be an actual particle. The first evidence of the reality of neutrinos came in 1938 via simultaneous cloud-chamber measurements of the electron and the recoil of the nucleus.

=== Direct detection ===

In 1942, Wang Ganchang first proposed the use of beta capture to experimentally detect neutrinos. In the 20 July 1956 issue of &quot;Science&quot;, Clyde Cowan, Frederick Reines, Francis B. &quot;Kiko&quot; Harrison, Herald W. Kruse, and Austin D. McGuire published confirmation that they had detected the neutrino, a result that was rewarded almost forty years later with the 1995 Nobel Prize.

In this experiment, now known as the Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment, antineutrinos created in a nuclear reactor by beta decay reacted with protons to produce neutrons and positrons:

The positron quickly finds an electron, and they annihilate each other. The two resulting gamma rays (γ) are detectable. The neutron can be detected by its capture on an appropriate nucleus, releasing a gamma ray. The coincidence of both events—positron annihilation and neutron capture—gives a unique signature of an antineutrino interaction.

In February 1965, the first neutrino found in nature was identified by a group including Frederick Reines and Friedel Sellschop. The experiment was performed in a specially prepared chamber at a depth of 3 km in the East Rand (&quot;ERPM&quot;) gold mine near Boksburg, South Africa. A plaque in the main building commemorates the discovery. The experiments also implemented a primitive neutrino astronomy and looked at issues of neutrino physics and weak interactions.

=== Neutrino flavor ===
The antineutrino discovered by Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines was the antiparticle of the electron neutrino.

In 1962, Leon M. Lederman, Melvin Schwartz, and Jack Steinberger showed that more than one type of neutrino exists by first detecting interactions of the muon neutrino (already hypothesised with the name &quot;neutretto&quot;), which earned them the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physics.

When the third type of lepton, the tau, was discovered in 1975 at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, it was also expected to have an associated neutrino (the tau neutrino). The first evidence for this third neutrino type came from the observation of missing energy and momentum in tau decays analogous to the beta decay leading to the discovery of the electron neutrino. The first detection of tau neutrino interactions was announced in 2000 by the DONUT collaboration at Fermilab; its existence had already been inferred by both theoretical consistency and experimental data from the Large Electron–Positron Collider.

=== Solar neutrino problem ===

In the 1960s, the now-famous Homestake experiment made the first measurement of the flux of electron neutrinos arriving from the core of the Sun and found a value that was between one third and one half the number predicted by the Standard Solar Model. This discrepancy, which became known as the solar neutrino problem, remained unresolved for some thirty years, while possible problems with both the experiment and the solar model were investigated, but none could be found. Eventually, it was realized that both were actually correct and that the discrepancy between them was due to neutrinos being more complex than was previously assumed. It was postulated that the three neutrinos had nonzero and slightly different masses, and could therefore oscillate into undetectable flavors on their flight to the Earth. This hypothesis was investigated by a new series of experiments, thereby opening a new major field of research that still continues. Eventual confirmation of the phenomenon of neutrino oscillation led to two Nobel prizes, one to R. Davis, who conceived and led the Homestake experiment and Masatoshi Koshiba of Kamiokande, whose work confirmed it, and one to Takaaki Kajita of Super-Kamiokande and A.B. McDonald of Sudbury Neutrino Observatory for their joint experiment, which confirmed the existence of all three neutrino flavors and found no deficit.

=== Oscillation ===

A practical method for investigating neutrino oscillations was first suggested by Bruno Pontecorvo in 1957 using an analogy with kaon oscillations; over the subsequent 10 years, he developed the mathematical formalism and the modern formulation of vacuum oscillations. In 1985 Stanislav Mikheyev and Alexei Smirnov (expanding on 1978 work by Lincoln Wolfenstein) noted that flavor oscillations can be modified when neutrinos propagate through matter. This so-called Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein effect (MSW effect) is important to understand because many neutrinos emitted by fusion in the Sun pass through the dense matter in the solar core (where essentially all solar fusion takes place) on their way to detectors on Earth.

Starting in 1998, experiments began to show that solar and atmospheric neutrinos change flavors (see Super-Kamiokande and Sudbury Neutrino Observatory). This resolved the solar neutrino problem: the electron neutrinos produced in the Sun had partly changed into other flavors which the experiments could not detect.

Although individual experiments, such as the set of solar neutrino experiments, are consistent with non-oscillatory mechanisms of neutrino flavor conversion, taken altogether, neutrino experiments imply the existence of neutrino oscillations. Especially relevant in this context are the reactor experiment KamLAND and the accelerator experiments such as MINOS. The KamLAND experiment has indeed identified oscillations as the neutrino flavor conversion mechanism involved in the solar electron neutrinos. Similarly MINOS confirms the oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos and gives a better determination of the mass squared splitting. Takaaki Kajita of Japan, and Arthur B. McDonald of Canada, received the 2015 Nobel Prize for Physics for their landmark finding, theoretical and experimental, that neutrinos can change flavors.

=== Cosmic neutrinos ===

As well as specific sources, a general background level of neutrinos is expected to pervade the universe, theorized to occur due to two main sources.

; Cosmic neutrino background (Big Bang-originated) :

Around 1 second after the Big Bang, neutrinos decoupled, giving rise to a background level of neutrinos known as the cosmic neutrino background (CNB).

; Diffuse supernova neutrino background (supernova-originated):

R. Davis and M. Koshiba were jointly awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physics. Both conducted pioneering work on solar neutrino detection, and Koshiba&#x27;s work also resulted in the first real-time observation of neutrinos from the SN 1987A supernova in the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud. These efforts marked the beginning of neutrino astronomy.

SN 1987A represents the only verified detection of neutrinos from a supernova. However, many stars have gone supernova in the universe, leaving a theorized diffuse supernova neutrino background.

== Properties and reactions ==
Neutrinos have half-integer spin (); therefore they are fermions. Neutrinos are leptons; therefore they are colorless fermions that cannot interact with the gluons of the nuclear force. They have only been observed to interact through the weak force, although it is assumed that they also interact gravitationally. Since they have non-zero mass, theoretical considerations permit neutrinos to interact magnetically, but do not require them to. As yet there is no experimental evidence for a non-zero magnetic moment in neutrinos.

=== Flavor, mass, and their mixing ===

Weak interactions create neutrinos in one of three leptonic flavors: electron neutrinos (), muon neutrinos (), or tau neutrinos (), associated with the corresponding charged leptons, the electron (), muon (), and tau (), respectively.

Although neutrinos were long believed to be massless, it is now known that there are three discrete neutrino masses; each neutrino flavor state is a linear combination of the three distinct mass eigenstates. Although only differences of squares of the three mass values are known as of 2016, experiments have shown that these masses are tiny compared to any other particle. From cosmological measurements, it has been calculated that the sum of the three neutrino masses must be less than one-millionth that of the electron (below 0.5 eV). Since the largest difference between squared masses is the heaviest neutrino must have mass at least 

More formally, neutrino flavor eigenstates (creation and annihilation combinations) are not the same as the neutrino mass eigenstates (simply labeled &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;3&quot;). As of 2024, it is not known which of these three is the heaviest. The neutrino mass hierarchy consists of two possible configurations. In analogy with the mass hierarchy of the charged leptons, the configuration with mass 2 being lighter than mass 3 is conventionally called the &quot;normal hierarchy&quot;, while in the &quot;inverted hierarchy&quot;, the opposite would hold. Several major experimental efforts are underway to help establish which is correct.

A neutrino created in a specific flavor eigenstate is in an associated specific quantum superposition of all three mass eigenstates. The three masses differ so little that they cannot possibly be distinguished experimentally within any practical flight path. The proportion of each mass state in the pure flavor states produced has been found to depend profoundly on the flavor. The relationship between flavor and mass eigenstates is encoded in the PMNS matrix. Experiments have established moderate- to low-precision values for the elements of this matrix, with the single complex phase in the matrix being only poorly known, as of 2016.

A non-zero mass means neutrinos could have a tiny magnetic moment. If so, neutrinos would interact electromagnetically, albeit probably undetectably considering their enormous velocities. No such interaction has ever been observed.

=== Flavor oscillations ===

Neutrinos oscillate between different flavors in flight. For example, an electron neutrino produced in a beta decay reaction may interact in a distant detector as a muon or tau neutrino, as defined by the flavor of the charged lepton produced in the detector. This oscillation occurs because the three mass state components of the produced flavor travel at slightly different speeds, so that their quantum mechanical wave packets develop relative phase shifts that change how they combine to produce a varying superposition of three flavors. Each flavor component thereby oscillates as the neutrino travels, with the flavors varying in relative strengths. The relative flavor proportions when the neutrino interacts represent the relative probabilities for that flavor of interaction to produce the corresponding flavor of charged lepton.

There are other possibilities in which neutrinos could oscillate even if they were massless: If Lorentz symmetry were not an exact symmetry, neutrinos could experience Lorentz-violating oscillations.

=== Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein effect ===

Neutrinos traveling through matter, in general, undergo a process analogous to light traveling through a transparent material. This process is not directly observable because it does not produce ionizing radiation, but gives rise to the Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein effect. Only a small fraction of the neutrino&#x27;s energy is transferred to the material.

=== Antineutrinos ===

For each neutrino, there also exists a corresponding antiparticle, called an &quot;antineutrino&quot;, which also has no electric charge and half-integer spin. They are distinguished from the neutrinos by having opposite signs of lepton number and opposite chirality (and consequently opposite-sign weak isospin). As of 2016, no evidence has been found for any other difference.

So far, despite extensive and continuing searches for exceptions, in all observed leptonic processes there has never been any change in total lepton number; for example, if the total lepton number is zero in the initial state, then the final state has only matched lepton and anti-lepton pairs: electron neutrinos appear in the final state together with only positrons (anti-electrons) or electron antineutrinos, and electron antineutrinos with electrons or electron neutrinos.

Antineutrinos are produced in nuclear beta decay together with a beta particle (in beta decay a neutron decays into a proton, electron, and antineutrino). All antineutrinos observed thus far had right-handed helicity (i.e., only one of the two possible spin states has ever been seen), while neutrinos were all left-handed.

Antineutrinos were first detected as a result of their interaction with protons in a large tank of water. This was installed next to a nuclear reactor as a controllable source of the antineutrinos (see Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment). Researchers around the world have begun to investigate the possibility of using antineutrinos for reactor monitoring in the context of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

=== Majorana mass ===

Because antineutrinos and neutrinos are neutral particles, it is possible that they are the same particle. Rather than conventional Dirac fermions, neutral particles can be another type of spin  particle called &quot;Majorana particles&quot;, named after the Italian physicist Ettore Majorana who first proposed the concept. For the case of neutrinos this theory has gained popularity as it can be used, in combination with the seesaw mechanism, to explain why neutrino masses are so small compared to those of the other elementary particles, such as electrons or quarks. Majorana neutrinos would have the property that the neutrino and antineutrino could be distinguished only by chirality; what experiments observe as a difference between the neutrino and antineutrino could simply be due to one particle with two possible chiralities.

, it is not known whether neutrinos are Majorana or Dirac particles. It is possible to test this property experimentally. For example, if neutrinos are indeed Majorana particles, then lepton-number violating processes such as neutrinoless double-beta decay would be allowed, while they would not if neutrinos are Dirac particles. Several experiments have been and are being conducted to search for this process, e.g. GERDA, EXO, SNO+, and CUORE. The cosmic neutrino background is also a probe of whether neutrinos are Majorana particles, since there should be a different number of cosmic neutrinos detected in either the Dirac or Majorana case.

=== Nuclear reactions ===
Neutrinos can interact with a nucleus, changing it to another nucleus. This process is used in radiochemical neutrino detectors. In this case, the energy levels and spin states within the target nucleus have to be taken into account to estimate the probability for an interaction. In general the interaction probability increases with the number of neutrons and protons within a nucleus.

It is very hard to uniquely identify neutrino interactions among the natural background of radioactivity. For this reason, in early experiments a special reaction channel was chosen to facilitate the identification: the interaction of an antineutrino with one of the hydrogen nuclei in the water molecules. A hydrogen nucleus is a single proton, so simultaneous nuclear interactions, which would occur within a heavier nucleus, do not need to be considered for the detection experiment. Within a cubic meter of water placed right outside a nuclear reactor, only relatively few such interactions can be recorded, but the setup is now used for measuring the reactor&#x27;s plutonium production rate.

=== Induced fission and other disintegration events ===
Very much like neutrons do in nuclear reactors, neutrinos can induce fission reactions within heavy nuclei. So far, this reaction has not been measured in a laboratory, but is predicted to happen within stars and supernovae. The process affects the abundance of isotopes seen in the universe. Neutrino-induced disintegration of deuterium nuclei has been observed in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, which uses a heavy water detector.

=== Types ===
There are three known types (&quot;flavors&quot;) of neutrinos: electron neutrino , muon neutrino , and tau neutrino , named after their partner leptons in the Standard Model (see table at right). The current best measurement of the number of neutrino types comes from observing the decay of the Z boson. This particle can decay into any light neutrino and its antineutrino, and the more available types of light neutrinos, the shorter the lifetime of the Z boson. Measurements of the Z lifetime have shown that three light neutrino flavors couple to the Z. The correspondence between the six quarks in the Standard Model and the six leptons, among them the three neutrinos, suggests to physicists&#x27; intuition that there should be exactly three types of neutrino.

== Research ==
There are several active research areas involving the neutrino with aspirations of finding:
* the three neutrino mass values
* the degree of CP violation in the leptonic sector (which may lead to leptogenesis)
* evidence of physics which might break the Standard Model of particle physics, such as neutrinoless double beta decay, which would be evidence for violation of lepton number conservation.

=== Detectors near artificial neutrino sources ===
International scientific collaborations install large neutrino detectors near nuclear reactors or in neutrino beams from particle accelerators to better constrain the neutrino masses and the values for the magnitude and rates of oscillations between neutrino flavors. These experiments are thereby searching for the existence of CP violation in the neutrino sector; that is, whether or not the laws of physics treat neutrinos and antineutrinos differently.

The KATRIN experiment in Germany began to acquire data in June 2018 to determine the value of the mass of the electron neutrino, with other approaches to this problem in the planning stages.

=== Gravitational effects ===
Despite their tiny masses, neutrinos are so numerous that their gravitational force can influence other matter in the universe.

The three known neutrino flavors are the only candidates for dark matter that are experimentally established elementary particles – specifically, they would be hot dark matter. However, the currently known neutrino types seem to be essentially ruled out as a substantial proportion of dark matter, based on observations of the cosmic microwave background. It still seems plausible that heavier, sterile neutrinos might compose warm dark matter, if they exist.

=== Sterile neutrino searches ===
Other efforts search for evidence of a sterile neutrino – a fourth neutrino flavor that would not interact with matter like the three known neutrino flavors. The possibility of sterile neutrinos is unaffected by the Z boson decay measurements described above: If their mass is greater than half the Z boson&#x27;s mass, they could not be a decay product. Therefore, to be consistent with not having been detected in Z boson decays, heavy sterile neutrinos would need to have a mass of at least 45.6 GeV.

The existence of such particles is in fact hinted by experimental data from the LSND experiment. On the other hand, the currently running MiniBooNE experiment suggested that sterile neutrinos are not required to explain the experimental data, although the latest research into this area is on-going and anomalies in the MiniBooNE data may allow for exotic neutrino types, including sterile neutrinos. A re-analysis of reference electron spectra data from the Institut Laue-Langevin in 2011 has also hinted at a fourth, light sterile neutrino. Triggered by the 2011 findings, several experiments at very short distances from nuclear reactors have searched for sterile neutrinos since then. While most of them were able to rule out the existence of a light sterile neutrino, the combined results are ambiguous.

According to an analysis published in 2010, data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe of the cosmic background radiation is compatible with either three or four types of neutrinos.

=== Neutrinoless double-beta decay searches ===
Another hypothesis concerns &quot;neutrinoless double-beta decay&quot;, which, if it exists, would violate lepton number conservation. Searches for this mechanism are underway but have not yet found evidence for it. If they were to, then what are now called antineutrinos could not be true antiparticles.

=== Cosmic ray neutrinos ===
Cosmic ray neutrino experiments detect neutrinos from space to study both the nature of neutrinos and the cosmic sources producing them.

=== Speed ===
Before neutrinos were found to oscillate, they were generally assumed to be massless, propagating at the speed of light (). According to the theory of special relativity, the question of neutrino velocity is closely related to their mass: If neutrinos are massless, they must travel at the speed of light, and if they have mass they cannot reach the speed of light. Due to their tiny mass, the predicted speed is extremely close to the speed of light in all experiments, and current detectors are not sensitive to the expected difference.

Also, there are some Lorentz-violating variants of quantum gravity which might allow faster-than-light neutrinos. A comprehensive framework for Lorentz violations is the Standard-Model Extension (SME).

The first measurements of neutrino speed were made in the early 1980s using pulsed pion beams (produced by pulsed proton beams hitting a target). The pions decayed producing neutrinos, and the neutrino interactions observed within a time window in a detector at a distance were consistent with the speed of light. This measurement was repeated in 2007 using the MINOS detectors, which found the speed of neutrinos to be, at the 99% confidence level, in the range between and . The central value of is higher than the speed of light but, with uncertainty taken into account, is also consistent with a velocity of exactly or slightly less. This measurement set an upper bound on the mass of the muon neutrino at with 99% confidence. After the detectors for the project were upgraded in 2012, MINOS refined their initial result and found agreement with the speed of light, with the difference in the arrival time of neutrinos and light of −0.0006% (±0.0012%).

A similar observation was made, on a much larger scale, with supernova 1987A (SN 1987A). Antineutrinos with an energy of 10 MeV from the supernova were detected within a time window that was consistent with the speed of light for the neutrinos. So far, all measurements of neutrino speed have been consistent with the speed of light.

==== Superluminal neutrino glitch ====
In September 2011, the OPERA collaboration released calculations showing velocities of 17 GeV and 28 GeV neutrinos exceeding the speed of light in their experiments. In November 2011, OPERA repeated its experiment with changes so that the speed could be determined individually for each detected neutrino. The results showed the same faster-than-light speed. In February 2012, reports came out that the results may have been caused by a loose fiber optic cable attached to one of the atomic clocks which measured the departure and arrival times of the neutrinos. An independent recreation of the experiment in the same laboratory by ICARUS found no discernible difference between the speed of a neutrino and the speed of light.

=== Mass ===

The Standard Model of particle physics assumed that neutrinos are massless. The experimentally established phenomenon of neutrino oscillation, which mixes neutrino flavor states with neutrino mass states (analogously to CKM mixing), requires neutrinos to have nonzero masses. Massive neutrinos were originally conceived by Bruno Pontecorvo in the 1950s. Enhancing the basic framework to accommodate their mass is straightforward by adding a right-handed Lagrangian.

Providing for neutrino mass can be done in two ways, and some proposals use both:
* If, like other fundamental Standard Model fermions, mass is generated by the Dirac mechanism, then the framework would require an additional right-chiral component which is an SU(2) singlet. This component would have the conventional Yukawa interactions with the neutral component of the Higgs doublet; but, otherwise, would have no interactions with Standard Model particles. 
* Or, else, mass can be generated by the Majorana mechanism, which would require the neutrino and antineutrino to be the same particle.

A hard upper limit on the masses of neutrinos comes from cosmology: the Big Bang model predicts that there is a fixed ratio between the number of neutrinos and the number of photons in the cosmic microwave background. If the total mass of all three types of neutrinos exceeded an average of per neutrino, there would be so much mass in the universe that it would collapse. This limit can be circumvented by assuming that the neutrino is unstable, but there are limits within the Standard Model that make this difficult. A much more stringent constraint comes from a careful analysis of cosmological data, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation, galaxy surveys, and the Lyman-alpha forest. Analysis of data from the WMAP microwave space telescope found that the sum of the masses of the three neutrino species must be less than . In 2018, the Planck collaboration published a stronger bound of , which was derived by combining their CMB total intensity, polarization and gravitational lensing observations with Baryon-Acoustic oscillation measurements from galaxy surveys and supernova measurements from Pantheon. A 2021 reanalysis that adds redshift space distortion measurements from the SDSS-IV eBOSS survey gets an even tighter upper limit of . However, several ground-based telescopes with similarly sized error bars as Planck prefer higher values for the neutrino mass sum, indicating some tension in the data sets.

The Nobel prize in Physics 2015 was awarded to Takaaki Kajita and Arthur B. McDonald for their experimental discovery of neutrino oscillations, which demonstrates that neutrinos have mass.

In 1998, research results at the Super-Kamiokande neutrino detector determined that neutrinos can oscillate from one flavor to another, which requires that they must have a nonzero mass. While this shows that neutrinos have mass, the absolute neutrino mass scale is still not known. This is because neutrino oscillations are sensitive only to the difference in the squares of the masses. As of 2020, the best-fit value of the difference of the squares of the masses of mass eigenstates 1 and 2 is while for eigenstates 2 and 3 it is Since is the difference of two squared masses, at least one of them must have a value that is at least the square root of this value. Thus, there exists at least one neutrino mass eigenstate with a mass of at least .

A number of efforts are under way to directly determine the absolute neutrino mass scale in laboratory experiments, especially using nuclear beta decay. Upper limits on the effective electron neutrino masses come from beta decays of tritium. The Mainz Neutrino Mass Experiment set an upper limit of at 95% Confidence Level. Since June 2018 the KATRIN experiment searches for a mass between and in tritium decays. The February 2022 upper limit is &quot;m&quot;ν &lt;  at 90% CL in combination with a previous campaign by KATRIN from 2019.

On 31 May 2010, OPERA researchers observed the first tau neutrino candidate event in a muon neutrino beam, the first time this transformation in neutrinos had been observed, providing further evidence that they have mass.

If the neutrino is a Majorana particle, the mass may be calculated by finding the half-life of neutrinoless double-beta decay of certain nuclei. The current lowest upper limit on the Majorana mass of the neutrino has been set by KamLAND-Zen: .

=== Chirality ===

Experimental results show that within the margin of error, all produced and observed neutrinos have left-handed helicities (spins antiparallel to momenta), and all antineutrinos have right-handed helicities. In the massless limit, that means that only one of two possible chiralities is observed for either particle. These are the only chiralities included in the Standard Model of particle interactions.

It is possible that their counterparts (right-handed neutrinos and left-handed antineutrinos) simply do not exist. If they &quot;do&quot; exist, their properties are substantially different from observable neutrinos and antineutrinos. It is theorized that they are either very heavy (on the order of GUT scale—see &quot;Seesaw mechanism&quot;), do not participate in weak interaction (so-called &quot;sterile neutrinos&quot;), or both.

The existence of nonzero neutrino masses somewhat complicates the situation. Neutrinos are produced in weak interactions as chirality eigenstates. Chirality of a massive particle is not a constant of motion; helicity is, but the chirality operator does not share eigenstates with the helicity operator. Free neutrinos propagate as mixtures of left- and right-handed helicity states, with mixing amplitudes on the order of . This does not significantly affect the experiments, because neutrinos involved are nearly always ultrarelativistic, and thus mixing amplitudes are vanishingly small. Effectively, they travel so quickly and time passes so slowly in their rest-frames that they do not have enough time to change over any observable path. For example, most solar neutrinos have energies on the order of ~; consequently, the fraction of neutrinos with &quot;wrong&quot; helicity among them cannot exceed .

=== GSI anomaly ===

An unexpected series of experimental results for the rate of decay of heavy highly charged radioactive ions circulating in a storage ring has provoked theoretical activity in an effort to find a convincing explanation. The observed phenomenon is known as the GSI anomaly, as the storage ring is a facility at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany.

The rates of weak decay of two radioactive species with half lives of about 40 seconds and 200 seconds were found to have a significant oscillatory modulation, with a period of about 7 seconds. As the decay process produces an electron neutrino, some of the suggested explanations for the observed oscillation rate propose new or altered neutrino properties. Ideas related to flavor oscillation met with skepticism. A later proposal is based on differences between neutrino mass eigenstates.

== Sources ==
=== Artificial ===

==== Reactor neutrinos ====
Nuclear reactors are the major source of human-generated neutrinos. The majority of energy in a nuclear reactor is generated by fission (the four main fissile isotopes in nuclear reactors are , , and ), the resultant neutron-rich daughter nuclides rapidly undergo additional beta decays, each converting one neutron to a proton and an electron and releasing an electron antineutrino. Including these subsequent decays, the average nuclear fission releases about of energy, of which roughly 95.5% remains in the core as heat, and roughly 4.5% (or about ) is radiated away as antineutrinos. For a typical nuclear reactor with a thermal power of , the total power production from fissioning atoms is actually , of which is radiated away as antineutrino radiation and never appears in the engineering. This is to say, of fission energy is &quot;lost&quot; from this reactor and does not appear as heat available to run turbines, since antineutrinos penetrate all building materials practically without interaction.

The antineutrino energy spectrum depends on the degree to which the fuel is burned (plutonium-239 fission antineutrinos on average have slightly more energy than those from uranium-235 fission), but in general, the &quot;detectable&quot; antineutrinos from fission have a peak energy between about 3.5 and , with a maximum energy of about . There is no established experimental method to measure the flux of low-energy antineutrinos, though experiments to demonstrate the capacity of low-energy neutrino detection via the threshold-less CEνNS interaction are ongoing. Only antineutrinos with an energy above threshold of can trigger inverse beta decay and thus be unambiguously identified (see below).

An estimated 3% of all antineutrinos from a nuclear reactor carry an energy above that threshold. Thus, an average nuclear power plant may generate over antineutrinos per second above the threshold, but also a much larger number ( this number) below the energy threshold; these lower-energy antineutrinos are invisible to present detector technology.

==== Accelerator neutrinos ====

Some particle accelerators have been used to make neutrino beams. The technique is to collide protons with a fixed target, producing charged pions or kaons. These unstable particles are then magnetically focused into a long tunnel where they decay while in flight. Because of the relativistic boost of the decaying particle, the neutrinos are produced as a beam rather than isotropically. Efforts to design an accelerator facility where neutrinos are produced through muon decays are ongoing. Such a setup is generally known as a &quot;neutrino factory&quot;.

==== Collider neutrinos ====
Unlike other artificial sources, colliders produce both neutrinos and anti-neutrinos of all flavors at very high energies. The first direct observation of collider neutrinos was reported in 2023 by the FASER experiment at the Large Hadron Collider.

==== Nuclear weapons ====
Nuclear weapons also produce very large quantities of neutrinos. Fred Reines and Clyde Cowan considered the detection of neutrinos from a bomb prior to their search for reactor neutrinos; a fission reactor was recommended as a better alternative by Los Alamos physics division leader J.M.B. Kellogg. Fission weapons produce antineutrinos (from the fission process), and fusion weapons produce both neutrinos (from the fusion process) and antineutrinos (from the initiating fission explosion).

=== Geologic ===
Neutrinos are produced together with the natural background radiation. In particular, the decay chains of and isotopes, as well as , include beta decays which emit antineutrinos. These so-called geoneutrinos can provide valuable information on the Earth&#x27;s interior. A first indication for geoneutrinos was found by the KamLAND experiment in 2005, updated results have been presented by KamLAND, and Borexino. The main background in the geoneutrino measurements are the antineutrinos coming from reactors.
=== Atmospheric ===
Atmospheric neutrinos result from the interaction of cosmic rays with atomic nuclei in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, creating showers of particles, many of which are unstable and produce neutrinos when they decay. A collaboration of particle physicists from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (India), Osaka City University (Japan) and Durham University (UK) recorded the first cosmic ray neutrino interaction in an underground laboratory in Kolar Gold Fields in India in 1965.

=== Solar ===

Solar neutrinos originate from the nuclear fusion powering the Sun and other stars.
The details of the operation of the Sun are explained by the Standard Solar Model. In short: when four protons fuse to become one helium nucleus, two of them have to convert into neutrons, and each such conversion releases one electron neutrino.

The Sun sends enormous numbers of neutrinos in all directions. Each second, about 65 billion () solar neutrinos pass through every square centimeter on the part of the Earth orthogonal to the direction of the Sun. Since neutrinos are insignificantly absorbed by the mass of the Earth, the surface area on the side of the Earth opposite the Sun receives about the same number of neutrinos as the side facing the Sun.

=== Supernovae ===

Colgate &amp; White (1966) calculated that neutrinos carry away most of the gravitational energy released during the collapse of massive stars, events now categorized as Type Ib and Ic and Type II supernovae. When such stars collapse, matter densities at the core become so high () that the degeneracy of electrons is not enough to prevent protons and electrons from combining to form a neutron and an electron neutrino. Mann (1997) found a second and more profuse neutrino source is the thermal energy (100 billion kelvins) of the newly formed neutron core, which is dissipated via the formation of neutrino–antineutrino pairs of all flavors.

Colgate and White&#x27;s theory of supernova neutrino production was confirmed in 1987, when neutrinos from Supernova 1987A were detected. The water-based detectors Kamiokande II and IMB detected 11 and 8 antineutrinos (lepton number = −1) of thermal origin, respectively, while the scintillator-based Baksan detector found 5 neutrinos (lepton number = +1) of either thermal or electron-capture origin, in a burst less than 13 seconds long. The neutrino signal from the supernova arrived at Earth several hours before the arrival of the first electromagnetic radiation, as expected from the evident fact that the latter emerges along with the shock wave. The exceptionally feeble interaction with normal matter allowed the neutrinos to pass through the churning mass of the exploding star, while the electromagnetic photons were slowed.

Because neutrinos interact so little with matter, it is thought that a supernova&#x27;s neutrino emissions carry information about the innermost regions of the explosion. Much of the &quot;visible&quot; light comes from the decay of radioactive elements produced by the supernova shock wave, and even light from the explosion itself is scattered by dense and turbulent gases, and thus delayed. The neutrino burst is expected to reach Earth before any electromagnetic waves, including visible light, gamma rays, or radio waves. The exact time delay of the electromagnetic waves&#x27; arrivals depends on the velocity of the shock wave and on the thickness of the outer layer of the star. For a Type II supernova, astronomers expect the neutrino flood to be released seconds after the stellar core collapse, while the first electromagnetic signal may emerge hours later, after the explosion shock wave has had time to reach the surface of the star. The SuperNova Early Warning System project uses a network of neutrino detectors to monitor the sky for candidate supernova events; the neutrino signal will provide a useful advance warning of a star exploding in the Milky Way.

Although neutrinos pass through the outer gases of a supernova without scattering, they provide information about the deeper supernova core with evidence that here, even neutrinos scatter to a significant extent. In a supernova core the densities are those of a neutron star (which is expected to be formed in this type of supernova), becoming large enough to influence the duration of the neutrino signal by delaying some neutrinos. The 13-second-long neutrino signal from SN 1987A lasted far longer than it would take for unimpeded neutrinos to cross through the neutrino-generating core of a supernova, expected to be only 3,200 kilometers in diameter for SN 1987A.

The number of neutrinos counted was also consistent with a total neutrino energy of , which was estimated to be nearly all of the total energy of the supernova.

For an average supernova, approximately (an octodecillion) neutrinos are released, but the actual number detected at a terrestrial detector formula_1 will be far smaller, at the level of
formula_2
where formula_3 is the mass of the detector (with e.g. Super Kamiokande having a mass of 50 kton) and formula_4 is the distance to the supernova.
Hence in practice it will only be possible to detect neutrino bursts from supernovae within or nearby the Milky Way (our own galaxy). In addition to the detection of neutrinos from individual supernovae, it should also be possible to detect the diffuse supernova neutrino background, which originates from all supernovae in the Universe.

=== Supernova remnants ===
The energy of supernova neutrinos ranges from a few to several tens of MeV. The sites where cosmic rays are accelerated are expected to produce neutrinos that are at least one million times more energetic, produced from turbulent gaseous environments left over by supernova explosions: Supernova remnants. The origin of the cosmic rays was attributed to supernovas by Baade and Zwicky; this hypothesis was refined by Ginzburg and Syrovatsky who attributed the origin to supernova remnants, and supported their claim by the crucial remark, that the cosmic ray losses of the Milky Way is compensated, if the efficiency of acceleration in supernova remnants is about 10 percent. Ginzburg and Syrovatskii&#x27;s hypothesis is supported by the specific mechanism of &quot;shock wave acceleration&quot; happening in supernova remnants, which is consistent with the original theoretical picture drawn by Enrico Fermi, and is receiving support from observational data. The very high-energy neutrinos are still to be seen, but this branch of neutrino astronomy is just in its infancy. The main existing or forthcoming experiments that aim at observing very-high-energy neutrinos from our galaxy are Baikal, AMANDA, IceCube, ANTARES, NEMO and Nestor. Related information is provided by very-high-energy gamma ray observatories, such as VERITAS, HESS and MAGIC. Indeed, the collisions of cosmic rays are supposed to produce charged pions, whose decay give the neutrinos, neutral pions, and gamma rays the environment of a supernova remnant, which is transparent to both types of radiation.

Still-higher-energy neutrinos, resulting from the interactions of extragalactic cosmic rays, could be observed with the Pierre Auger Observatory or with the dedicated experiment named ANITA.

=== Big Bang ===

It is thought that, just like the cosmic microwave background radiation leftover from the Big Bang, there is a background of low-energy neutrinos in our Universe. In the 1980s it was proposed that these may be the explanation for the dark matter thought to exist in the universe. Neutrinos have one important advantage over most other dark matter candidates: They are known to exist. This idea also has serious problems.

From particle experiments, it is known that neutrinos are very light. This means that they easily move at speeds close to the speed of light. For this reason, dark matter made from neutrinos is termed &quot;hot dark matter&quot;. The problem is that being fast moving, the neutrinos would tend to have spread out evenly in the universe before cosmological expansion made them cold enough to congregate in clumps. This would cause the part of dark matter made of neutrinos to be smeared out and unable to cause the large galactic structures that we see.

These same galaxies and groups of galaxies appear to be surrounded by dark matter that is not fast enough to escape from those galaxies. Presumably this matter provided the gravitational nucleus for formation. This implies that neutrinos cannot make up a significant part of the total amount of dark matter.

From cosmological arguments, relic background neutrinos are estimated to have density of 56 of each type per cubic centimeter and temperature () if they are massless, much colder if their mass exceeds . Although their density is quite high, they have not yet been observed in the laboratory, as their energy is below thresholds of most detection methods, and due to extremely low neutrino interaction cross-sections at sub-eV energies. In contrast, boron-8 solar neutrinos—which are emitted with a higher energy—have been detected definitively despite having a space density that is lower than that of relic neutrinos by some six orders of magnitude.

== Detection ==
Neutrinos are extremely difficult to detect directly, as they do not carry electric charge, which means they do not ionize the materials they pass through. They however carry a Weak charge, and can therefore interact with matter through the Weak interaction, in both charged and neutral current forms. However, given its short range and weak coupling, such interactions are exceedingly rare.

Antineutrinos were first detected in the 1950s near a nuclear reactor. Reines and Cowan used two targets containing a solution of cadmium chloride in water. Two scintillation detectors were placed next to the cadmium targets. Antineutrinos with an energy above the threshold of caused charged current interactions with the protons in the water, an interaction usually known as inverse beta decay, producing positrons and neutrons. This is very much like decay, where energy is used to convert a proton into a neutron, a positron () and an electron neutrino () is emitted:
In the Cowan and Reines experiment, instead of an outgoing neutrino, an incoming antineutrino () from a nuclear reactor interacts with a proton:

The resulting positron annihilation with electrons in the detector material created photons with an energy of about . Pairs of photons in coincidence could be detected by the two scintillation detectors above and below the target. The neutrons were captured by cadmium nuclei resulting in gamma rays of about that were detected a few microseconds after the photons from a positron annihilation event.

Since then, various detection methods have been used. Super Kamiokande is a large volume of water surrounded by photomultiplier tubes that watch for the Cherenkov radiation emitted when an incoming neutrino creates an electron or muon in the water. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory is similar, but used heavy water as the detecting medium, which uses the same effects, but also allows the additional reaction any-flavor neutrino photo-dissociation of deuterium, resulting in a free neutron which is then detected from gamma radiation after chlorine-capture. Other detectors have consisted of large volumes of chlorine or gallium which are periodically checked for excesses of argon or germanium, respectively, which are created by electron-neutrinos interacting with the original substance. MINOS used a solid plastic scintillator coupled to photomultiplier tubes, while Borexino uses a liquid pseudocumene scintillator also watched by photomultiplier tubes and the NOνA detector uses liquid scintillator watched by avalanche photodiodes. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory uses of the Antarctic ice sheet near the south pole with photomultiplier tubes distributed throughout the volume. 

More exotically, some experiments (such as COHERENT and CONUS) leverage the neutral current interaction of neutrinos with a whole nucleus, the CEνNS interaction, to detect neutrinos below the threshold of inverse beta decay. These experiments, which overwhelmingly use crystal-based detectors very similar to the solid-state detectors in use for direct detection of dark matter experiments, are some of the most sensitive particle detectors in modern physics, boasting thresholds as low as 20eV deposited in the detector. This is necessary as the heavier nuclei, selected for the high probability of interaction, will retain very little of the energy in an elastic scattering, being much more massive than the neutrino.

Other ways neutrinos might affect their environment, such as the MSW effect, do not produce traceable radiation, and are not predicted to be detectable.

== Scientific interest ==
Neutrinos&#x27; low mass and neutral charge mean they interact exceedingly weakly with other particles and fields. This feature of weak interaction interests scientists because it means neutrinos can be used to probe environments that other radiation (such as light or radio waves) cannot penetrate.

Using neutrinos as a probe was first proposed in the mid-20th century as a way to detect conditions at the core of the Sun. The solar core cannot be imaged directly because electromagnetic radiation (such as light) is diffused by the great amount and density of matter surrounding the core. On the other hand, neutrinos pass through the Sun with few interactions. Whereas photons emitted from the solar core may require  years to diffuse to the outer layers of the Sun, neutrinos generated in stellar fusion reactions at the core cross this distance practically unimpeded at nearly the speed of light.

Neutrinos are also useful for probing astrophysical sources beyond the Solar System because they are the only known particles that are not significantly attenuated by their travel through the interstellar medium. Optical photons can be obscured or diffused by dust, gas, and background radiation. High-energy cosmic rays, in the form of swift protons and atomic nuclei, are unable to travel more than about 100 megaparsecs due to the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit (GZK cutoff). Neutrinos, in contrast, can travel even greater distances barely attenuated.

The galactic core of the Milky Way is fully obscured by dense gas and numerous bright objects. Neutrinos produced in the galactic core might be measurable by Earth-based neutrino telescopes.

Another important use of the neutrino is in the observation of supernovae, the explosions that end the lives of highly massive stars. The core collapse phase of a supernova is an extremely dense and energetic event. It is so dense that no known particles are able to escape the advancing core front except for neutrinos. Consequently, supernovae are known to release approximately 99% of their radiant energy in a short (10-second) burst of neutrinos. These neutrinos are a very useful probe for core collapse studies.

The rest mass of the neutrino is an important test of cosmological and astrophysical theories. The neutrino&#x27;s significance in probing cosmological phenomena is as great as any other method, and is thus a major focus of study in astrophysical communities.

The study of neutrinos is important in particle physics because neutrinos typically have the lowest rest mass among massive particles (i.e. the lowest non-zero rest mass, i.e. excluding the zero rest mass of photons and gluons), and hence are examples of the lowest-energy massive particles theorized in extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics.

In November 2012, American scientists used a particle accelerator to send a coherent neutrino message through 780 feet of rock. This marks the first use of neutrinos for communication, and future research may permit binary neutrino messages to be sent immense distances through even the densest materials, such as the Earth&#x27;s core.

In July 2018, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory announced that they have traced an extremely-high-energy neutrino that hit their Antarctica-based research station in September 2017 back to its point of origin in the blazar TXS 0506+056 located 3.7 billion light-years away in the direction of the constellation Orion. This is the first time that a neutrino detector has been used to locate an object in space and that a source of cosmic rays has been identified.

In November 2022, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory found evidence of high-energy neutrino emission from NGC 1068, also known as Messier 77, an active galaxy in the constellation Cetus and one of the most familiar and well-studied galaxies to date.

In June 2023, astronomers reported using a new technique to detect, for the first time, the release of neutrinos from the galactic plane of the Milky Way galaxy.

<text>Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers (nm). At this scale, commonly known as the nanoscale, surface area and quantum mechanical effects become important in describing properties of matter. This definition of nanotechnology includes all types of research and technologies that deal with these special properties. It is common to see the plural form &quot;nanotechnologies&quot; as well as &quot;nanoscale technologies&quot; to refer to research and applications whose common trait is scale. An earlier understanding of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabricating macroscale products, now referred to as molecular nanotechnology.

Nanotechnology defined by scale includes fields of science such as surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, energy storage, engineering, microfabrication, and molecular engineering. The associated research and applications range from extensions of conventional device physics to molecular self-assembly, from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale.

Nanotechnology may be able to create new materials and devices with diverse applications, such as in nanomedicine, nanoelectronics, agricultural sectors, biomaterials energy production, and consumer products. However, nanotechnology raises issues, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials, and their potential effects on global economics, as well as various doomsday scenarios. These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted.

==Origins==

The concepts that seeded nanotechnology were first discussed in 1959 by physicist Richard Feynman in his talk &quot;There&#x27;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom&quot;, in which he described the possibility of synthesis via direct manipulation of atoms.

The term &quot;nano-technology&quot; was first used by Norio Taniguchi in 1974, though it was not widely known. Inspired by Feynman&#x27;s concepts, K. Eric Drexler used the term &quot;nanotechnology&quot; in his 1986 book &quot;Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology&quot;, which proposed the idea of a nanoscale &quot;assembler&quot; that would be able to build a copy of itself and of other items of arbitrary complexity with atom-level control. Also in 1986, Drexler co-founded The Foresight Institute to increase public awareness and understanding of nanotechnology concepts and implications.

The emergence of nanotechnology as a field in the 1980s occurred through the convergence of Drexler&#x27;s theoretical and public work, which developed and popularized a conceptual framework, and high-visibility experimental advances that drew additional attention to the prospects. In the 1980s, two breakthroughs sparked the growth of nanotechnology. First, the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope in 1981 enabled visualization of individual atoms and bonds, and was successfully used to manipulate individual atoms in 1989. The microscope&#x27;s developers Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer at IBM Zurich Research Laboratory received a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986. Binnig, Quate and Gerber also invented the analogous atomic force microscope that year.

Second, fullerenes (buckyballs) were discovered in 1985 by Harry Kroto, Richard Smalley, and Robert Curl, who together won the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. C60 was not initially described as nanotechnology; the term was used regarding subsequent work with related carbon nanotubes (sometimes called graphene tubes or Bucky tubes) which suggested potential applications for nanoscale electronics and devices. The discovery of carbon nanotubes is largely attributed to Sumio Iijima of NEC in 1991, for which Iijima won the inaugural 2008 Kavli Prize in Nanoscience.

In the early 2000s, the field garnered increased scientific, political, and commercial attention that led to both controversy and progress. Controversies emerged regarding the definitions and potential implications of nanotechnologies, exemplified by the Royal Society&#x27;s report on nanotechnology. Challenges were raised regarding the feasibility of applications envisioned by advocates of molecular nanotechnology, which culminated in a public debate between Drexler and Smalley in 2001 and 2003.

Meanwhile, commercial products based on advancements in nanoscale technologies began emerging. These products were limited to bulk applications of nanomaterials and did not involve atomic control of matter. Some examples include the Silver Nano platform for using silver nanoparticles as an antibacterial agent, nanoparticle-based sunscreens, carbon fiber strengthening using silica nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes for stain-resistant textiles.

Governments moved to promote and fund research into nanotechnology, such as American the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which formalized a size-based definition of nanotechnology and established research funding, and in Europe via the European Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development.

By the mid-2000s scientific attention began to flourish. Nanotechnology roadmaps centered on atomically precise manipulation of matter and discussed existing and projected capabilities, goals, and applications.

==Fundamental concepts==
Nanotechnology is the science and engineering of functional systems at the molecular scale. In its original sense, nanotechnology refers to the projected ability to construct items from the bottom up making complete, high-performance products.

One nanometer (nm) is one billionth, or 10−9, of a meter. By comparison, typical carbon–carbon bond lengths, or the spacing between these atoms in a molecule, are in the range , and DNA&#x27;s diameter is around 2 nm. On the other hand, the smallest cellular life forms, the bacteria of the genus &quot;Mycoplasma&quot;, are around 200 nm in length. By convention, nanotechnology is taken as the scale range , following the definition used by the American National Nanotechnology Initiative. The lower limit is set by the size of atoms (hydrogen has the smallest atoms, which have an approximately ,25 nm kinetic diameter). The upper limit is more or less arbitrary, but is around the size below which phenomena not observed in larger structures start to become apparent and can be made use of. These phenomena make nanotechnology distinct from devices that are merely miniaturized versions of an equivalent macroscopic device; such devices are on a larger scale and come under the description of microtechnology.

To put that scale in another context, the comparative size of a nanometer to a meter is the same as that of a marble to the size of the earth.

Two main approaches are used in nanotechnology. In the &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach, materials and devices are built from molecular components which assemble themselves chemically by principles of molecular recognition. In the &quot;top-down&quot; approach, nano-objects are constructed from larger entities without atomic-level control.

Areas of physics such as nanoelectronics, nanomechanics, nanophotonics and nanoionics have evolved to provide nanotechnology&#x27;s scientific foundation.

===Larger to smaller: a materials perspective===


Several phenomena become pronounced as system size. These include statistical mechanical effects, as well as quantum mechanical effects, for example, the &quot;quantum size effect&quot; in which the electronic properties of solids alter along with reductions in particle size. Such effects do not apply at macro or micro dimensions. However, quantum effects can become significant when nanometer scales. Additionally, physical (mechanical, electrical, optical, etc.) properties change versus macroscopic systems. One example is the increase in surface area to volume ratio altering mechanical, thermal, and catalytic properties of materials. Diffusion and reactions can be different as well. Systems with fast ion transport are referred to as nanoionics. The mechanical properties of nanosystems are of interest in research.

===Simple to complex: a molecular perspective===
Modern synthetic chemistry can prepare small molecules of almost any structure. These methods are used to manufacture a wide variety of useful chemicals such as pharmaceuticals or commercial polymers. This ability raises the question of extending this kind of control to the next-larger level, seeking methods to assemble single molecules into supramolecular assemblies consisting of many molecules arranged in a well-defined manner.

These approaches utilize the concepts of molecular self-assembly and/or supramolecular chemistry to automatically arrange themselves into a useful conformation through a bottom-up approach. The concept of molecular recognition is important: molecules can be designed so that a specific configuration or arrangement is favored due to non-covalent intermolecular forces. The Watson–Crick basepairing rules are a direct result of this, as is the specificity of an enzyme targeting a single substrate, or the specific folding of a protein. Thus, components can be designed to be complementary and mutually attractive so that they make a more complex and useful whole.

Such bottom-up approaches should be capable of producing devices in parallel and be much cheaper than top-down methods, but could potentially be overwhelmed as the size and complexity of the desired assembly increases. Most useful structures require complex and thermodynamically unlikely arrangements of atoms. Nevertheless, many examples of self-assembly based on molecular recognition in exist in biology, most notably Watson–Crick basepairing and enzyme-substrate interactions.

===Molecular nanotechnology: a long-term view===
Molecular nanotechnology, sometimes called molecular manufacturing, concerns engineered nanosystems (nanoscale machines) operating on the molecular scale. Molecular nanotechnology is especially associated with molecular assemblers, machines that can produce a desired structure or device atom-by-atom using the principles of mechanosynthesis. Manufacturing in the context of productive nanosystems is not related to conventional technologies used to manufacture nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and nanoparticles.

When Drexler independently coined and popularized the term &quot;nanotechnology&quot;, he envisioned manufacturing technology based on molecular machine systems. The premise was that molecular-scale biological analogies of traditional machine components demonstrated molecular machines were possible: biology was full of examples of sophisticated, stochastically optimized biological machines.

Drexler and other researchers have proposed that advanced nanotechnology ultimately could be based on mechanical engineering principles, namely, a manufacturing technology based on the mechanical functionality of these components (such as gears, bearings, motors, and structural members) that would enable programmable, positional assembly to atomic specification. The physics and engineering performance of exemplar designs were analyzed in Drexler&#x27;s book &quot;Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation&quot;.

In general, assembling devices on the atomic scale requires positioning atoms on other atoms of comparable size and stickiness. Carlo Montemagno&#x27;s view is that future nanosystems will be hybrids of silicon technology and biological molecular machines. Richard Smalley argued that mechanosynthesis was impossible due to difficulties in mechanically manipulating individual molecules.

This led to an exchange of letters in the ACS publication Chemical &amp; Engineering News in 2003. Though biology clearly demonstrates that molecular machines are possible, non-biological molecular machines remained in their infancy. Alex Zettl and colleagues at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories and UC Berkeley constructed at least three molecular devices whose motion is controlled via changing voltage: a nanotube nanomotor, a molecular actuator, and a nanoelectromechanical relaxation oscillator.

Ho and Lee at Cornell University in 1999 used a scanning tunneling microscope to move an individual carbon monoxide molecule (CO) to an individual iron atom (Fe) sitting on a flat silver crystal and chemically bound the CO to the Fe by applying a voltage.

==Research==

===Nanomaterials===
Many areas of science develop or study materials having unique properties arising from their nanoscale dimensions.
*Interface and colloid science produced many materials that may be useful in nanotechnology, such as carbon nanotubes and other fullerenes, and various nanoparticles and nanorods. Nanomaterials with fast ion transport are related to nanoionics and nanoelectronics.
*Nanoscale materials can be used for bulk applications; most commercial applications of nanotechnology are of this flavor.
*Progress has been made in using these materials for medical applications, including tissue engineering, drug delivery, antibacterials and biosensors.
*Nanoscale materials such as nanopillars are used in solar cells.
*Applications incorporating semiconductor nanoparticles in products such as display technology, lighting, solar cells and biological imaging; see quantum dots.

===Bottom-up approaches===
The bottom-up approach seeks to arrange smaller components into more complex assemblies.
*DNA nanotechnology utilizes Watson–Crick basepairing to construct well-defined structures out of DNA and other nucleic acids.
*Approaches from the field of &quot;classical&quot; chemical synthesis (inorganic and organic synthesis) aim at designing molecules with well-defined shape (e.g. bis-peptides).
*More generally, molecular self-assembly seeks to use concepts of supramolecular chemistry, and molecular recognition in particular, to cause single-molecule components to automatically arrange themselves into some useful conformation.
*Atomic force microscope tips can be used as a nanoscale &quot;write head&quot; to deposit a chemical upon a surface in a desired pattern in a process called dip-pen nanolithography. This technique fits into the larger subfield of nanolithography.
*Molecular-beam epitaxy allows for bottom-up assemblies of materials, most notably semiconductor materials commonly used in chip and computing applications, stacks, gating, and nanowire lasers.

===Top-down approaches===
These seek to create smaller devices by using larger ones to direct their assembly.
*Many technologies that descended from conventional solid-state silicon methods for fabricating microprocessors are capable of creating features smaller than 100 nm. Giant magnetoresistance-based hard drives already on the market fit this description, as do atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques. Peter Grünberg and Albert Fert received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2007 for their discovery of giant magnetoresistance and contributions to the field of spintronics.
*Solid-state techniques can be used to create nanoelectromechanical systems or NEMS, which are related to microelectromechanical systems or MEMS.
*Focused ion beams can directly remove material, or even deposit material when suitable precursor gasses are applied at the same time. For example, this technique is used routinely to create sub-100 nm sections of material for analysis in transmission electron microscopy.
*Atomic force microscope tips can be used as a nanoscale &quot;write head&quot; to deposit a resist, which is then followed by an etching process to remove material in a top-down method.

===Functional approaches===
Functional approaches seek to develop useful components without regard to how they might be assembled.
*Magnetic assembly for the synthesis of anisotropic superparamagnetic materials such as magnetic nano chains.
*Molecular scale electronics seeks to develop molecules with useful electronic properties. These could be used as single-molecule components in a nanoelectronic device, such as rotaxane.
*Synthetic chemical methods can be used to create synthetic molecular motors, such as in a so-called nanocar.

===Biomimetic approaches===
* Bionics or biomimicry seeks to apply biological methods and systems found in nature to the study and design of engineering systems and modern technology. Biomineralization is one example of the systems studied.
* Bionanotechnology is the use of biomolecules for applications in nanotechnology, including the use of viruses and lipid assemblies. Nanocellulose, a nanopolymer often used for bulk-scale applications, has gained interest owing to its useful properties such as abundance, high aspect ratio, good mechanical properties, renewability, and biocompatibility.

===Speculative===
These subfields seek to anticipate what inventions nanotechnology might yield, or attempt to propose an agenda along which inquiry could progress. These often take a big-picture view, with more emphasis on societal implications than engineering details.
*Molecular nanotechnology is a proposed approach that involves manipulating single molecules in finely controlled, deterministic ways. This is more theoretical than the other subfields, and many of its proposed techniques are beyond current capabilities.
*Nanorobotics considers self-sufficient machines operating at the nanoscale. There are hopes for applying nanorobots in medicine. Nevertheless, progress on innovative materials and patented methodologies have been demonstrated.
*Productive nanosystems are &quot;systems of nanosystems&quot; could produce atomically precise parts for other nanosystems, not necessarily using novel nanoscale-emergent properties, but well-understood fundamentals of manufacturing. Because of the discrete (i.e. atomic) nature of matter and the possibility of exponential growth, this stage could form the basis of another industrial revolution. Mihail Roco proposed four states of nanotechnology that seem to parallel the technical progress of the Industrial Revolution, progressing from passive nanostructures to active nanodevices to complex nanomachines and ultimately to productive nanosystems.
*Programmable matter seeks to design materials whose properties can be easily, reversibly and externally controlled though a fusion of information science and materials science.
*Due to the popularity and media exposure of the term nanotechnology, the words picotechnology and femtotechnology have been coined in analogy to it, although these are used only informally.

===Dimensionality in nanomaterials===
Nanomaterials can be classified in 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D nanomaterials. Dimensionality plays a major role in determining the characteristic of nanomaterials including physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. With the decrease in dimensionality, an increase in surface-to-volume ratio is observed. This indicates that smaller dimensional nanomaterials have higher surface area compared to 3D nanomaterials. Two dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have been extensively investigated for electronic, biomedical, drug delivery and biosensor applications.

==Tools and techniques==
===Scanning microscopes===
The atomic force microscope (AFM) and the Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) are two versions of scanning probes that are used for nano-scale observation. Other types of scanning probe microscopy have much higher resolution, since they are not limited by the wavelengths of sound or light.

The tip of a scanning probe can also be used to manipulate nanostructures (positional assembly). Feature-oriented scanning may be a promising way to implement these nano-scale manipulations via an automatic algorithm. However, this is still a slow process because of low velocity of the microscope.

The top-down approach anticipates nanodevices that must be built piece by piece in stages, much as manufactured items are made. Scanning probe microscopy is an important technique both for characterization and synthesis. Atomic force microscopes and scanning tunneling microscopes can be used to look at surfaces and to move atoms around. By designing different tips for these microscopes, they can be used for carving out structures on surfaces and to help guide self-assembling structures. By using, for example, feature-oriented scanning approach, atoms or molecules can be moved around on a surface with scanning probe microscopy techniques.

===Lithography===
Various techniques of lithography, such as optical lithography, X-ray lithography, dip pen lithography, electron beam lithography or nanoimprint lithography offer top-down fabrication techniques where a bulk material is reduced to a nano-scale pattern.

Another group of nano-technological techniques include those used for fabrication of nanotubes and nanowires, those used in semiconductor fabrication such as deep ultraviolet lithography, electron beam lithography, focused ion beam machining, nanoimprint lithography, atomic layer deposition, and molecular vapor deposition, and further including molecular self-assembly techniques such as those employing di-block copolymers.

====Bottom-up====
In contrast, bottom-up techniques build or grow larger structures atom by atom or molecule by molecule. These techniques include chemical synthesis, self-assembly and positional assembly. Dual-polarization interferometry is one tool suitable for characterization of self-assembled thin films. Another variation of the bottom-up approach is molecular-beam epitaxy or MBE. Researchers at Bell Telephone Laboratories including John R. Arthur. Alfred Y. Cho, and Art C. Gossard developed and implemented MBE as a research tool in the late 1960s and 1970s. Samples made by MBE were key to the discovery of the fractional quantum Hall effect for which the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded. MBE lays down atomically precise layers of atoms and, in the process, build up complex structures. Important for research on semiconductors, MBE is also widely used to make samples and devices for the newly emerging field of spintronics.

Therapeutic products based on responsive nanomaterials, such as the highly deformable, stress-sensitive Transfersome vesicles, are approved for human use in some countries.

==Applications==


As of August 21, 2008, the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies estimated that over 800 manufacturer-identified nanotech products were publicly available, with new ones hitting the market at a pace of 3–4 per week. Most applications are &quot;first generation&quot; passive nanomaterials that includes titanium dioxide in sunscreen, cosmetics, surface coatings, and some food products; Carbon allotropes used to produce gecko tape; silver in food packaging, clothing, disinfectants, and household appliances; zinc oxide in sunscreens and cosmetics, surface coatings, paints and outdoor furniture varnishes; and cerium oxide as a fuel catalyst.

In the electric car industry, single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) address key lithium-ion battery challenges, including energy density, charge rate, service life, and cost. SWCNTs connect electrode particles during charge/discharge process, preventing battery premature degradation. Their exceptional ability to wrap active material particles enhanced electrical conductivity and physical properties, setting them apart multi-walled carbon nanotubes and carbon black.

Further applications allow tennis balls to last longer, golf balls to fly straighter, and bowling balls to become more durable. Trousers and socks have been infused with nanotechnology to last longer and lower temperature in the summer. Bandages are infused with silver nanoparticles to heal cuts faster. Video game consoles and personal computers may become cheaper, faster, and contain more memory thanks to nanotechnology. Also, to build structures for on chip computing with light, for example on chip optical quantum information processing, and picosecond transmission of information.

Nanotechnology may have the ability to make existing medical applications cheaper and easier to use in places like the doctors&#x27; offices and at homes. Cars use nanomaterials in such ways that car parts require fewer metals during manufacturing and less fuel to operate in the future.

Nanoencapsulation involves the enclosure of active substances within carriers. Typically, these carriers offer advantages, such as enhanced bioavailability, controlled release, targeted delivery, and protection of the encapsulated substances. In the medical field, nanoencapsulation plays a significant role in drug delivery. It facilitates more efficient drug administration, reduces side effects, and increases treatment effectiveness. Nanoencapsulation is particularly useful for improving the bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs, enabling controlled and sustained drug release, and supporting the development of targeted therapies. These features collectively contribute to advancements in medical treatments and patient care.

Nanotechnology may play role in tissue engineering. When designing scaffolds, researchers attempt to mimic the nanoscale features of a cell&#x27;s microenvironment to direct its differentiation down a suitable lineage. For example, when creating scaffolds to support bone growth, researchers may mimic osteoclast resorption pits.

Researchers used DNA origami-based nanobots capable of carrying out logic functions to target drug delivery in cockroaches.

A nano bible (a .5mm2 silicon chip) was created by the Technion in order to increase youth interest in nanotechnology.

==Implications==
One concern is the effect that industrial-scale manufacturing and use of nanomaterials will have on human health and the environment, as suggested by nanotoxicology research. For these reasons, some groups advocate that nanotechnology be regulated. However, regulation might stifle scientific research and the development of beneficial innovations. Public health research agencies, such as the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health research potential health effects stemming from exposures to nanoparticles.

Nanoparticle products may have unintended consequences. Researchers have discovered that bacteriostatic silver nanoparticles used in socks to reduce foot odor are released in the wash. These particles are then flushed into the wastewater stream and may destroy bacteria that are critical components of natural ecosystems, farms, and waste treatment processes.

Public deliberations on risk perception in the US and UK carried out by the Center for Nanotechnology in Society found that participants were more positive about nanotechnologies for energy applications than for health applications, with health applications raising moral and ethical dilemmas such as cost and availability.

Experts, including director of the Woodrow Wilson Center&#x27;s Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies David Rejeski, testified that commercialization depends on adequate oversight, risk research strategy, and public engagement. As of 206 Berkeley, California was the only US city to regulate nanotechnology.

===Health and environmental concerns===
Inhaling airborne nanoparticles and nanofibers may contribute to pulmonary diseases, e.g. fibrosis. Researchers found that when rats breathed in nanoparticles, the particles settled in the brain and lungs, which led to significant increases in biomarkers for inflammation and stress response and that nanoparticles induce skin aging through oxidative stress in hairless mice.

A two-year study at UCLA&#x27;s School of Public Health found lab mice consuming nano-titanium dioxide showed DNA and chromosome damage to a degree &quot;linked to all the big killers of man, namely cancer, heart disease, neurological disease and aging&quot;.

A &quot;Nature Nanotechnology&quot; study suggested that some forms of carbon nanotubes could be as harmful as asbestos if inhaled in sufficient quantities. Anthony Seaton of the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh, Scotland, who contributed to the article on carbon nanotubes said &quot;We know that some of them probably have the potential to cause mesothelioma. So those sorts of materials need to be handled very carefully.&quot; In the absence of specific regulation forthcoming from governments, Paull and Lyons (2008) have called for an exclusion of engineered nanoparticles in food. A newspaper article reports that workers in a paint factory developed serious lung disease and nanoparticles were found in their lungs.

==Regulation==
Calls for tighter regulation of nanotechnology have accompanied a debate related to human health and safety risks. Some regulatory agencies cover some nanotechnology products and processes – by &quot;bolting on&quot; nanotechnology to existing regulations – leaving clear gaps. Davies proposed a road map describing steps to deal with these shortcomings.

Andrew Maynard, chief science advisor to the Woodrow Wilson Center&#x27;s Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies, reported insufficient funding for human health and safety research, and as a result inadequate understanding of human health and safety risks. Some academics called for stricter application of the precautionary principle, slowing marketing approval, enhanced labelling and additional safety data.

A Royal Society report identified a risk of nanoparticles or nanotubes being released during disposal, destruction and recycling, and recommended that &quot;manufacturers of products that fall under extended producer responsibility regimes such as end-of-life regulations publish procedures outlining how these materials will be managed to minimize possible human and environmental exposure&quot;.

<text>NetHack is an open source single-player roguelike video game, first released in 1987 and maintained by the NetHack DevTeam. The game is a fork of the 1982 game &quot;Hack&quot;, itself inspired by the 1980 game &quot;Rogue&quot;. The player takes the role of one of several pre-defined character classes to descend through multiple dungeon floors, fighting monsters and collecting treasure, to recover the &quot;Amulet of Yendor&quot; at the lowest floor and then escape.

As an exemplar of the traditional &quot;roguelike&quot; game, &quot;NetHack&quot; features turn-based, grid-based hack and slash and dungeon crawling gameplay, procedurally generated dungeons and treasure, and permadeath, requiring the player to restart the game anew should the player character die. The game uses simple ASCII graphics by default so as to display readily on a wide variety of computer displays, but can use curses with box-drawing characters, as well as substitute graphical tilesets on machines with graphics. While &quot;Rogue&quot;, &quot;Hack&quot; and other earlier roguelikes stayed true to a high fantasy setting, &quot;NetHack&quot; introduced humorous and anachronistic elements over time, including popular cultural reference to works such as &quot;Discworld&quot; and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;.

It is identified as one of the &quot;major roguelikes&quot; by John Harris. Comparing it with &quot;Rogue&quot;, &quot;Engadget&quot;″s Justin Olivetti wrote that it took its exploration aspect and &quot;made it far richer with an encyclopedia of objects, a larger vocabulary, a wealth of pop culture mentions, and a puzzler&#x27;s attitude.&quot; In 2000, &quot;Salon&quot; described it as &quot;one of the finest gaming experiences the computing world has to offer&quot;.

==Gameplay==
Before starting a game, players choose their character&#x27;s race, role, sex, and alignment, or allow the game to assign the attributes randomly. There are traditional fantasy roles such as knight, wizard, rogue, and priest; but there are also unusual roles, including archaeologist, tourist, and caveman. The player character&#x27;s role and alignment dictate which deity the character serves and is supported by in the game, &quot;how other monsters react toward you&quot;, as well as character skills and attributes.

After the player character is created, the main objective is introduced. To win the game, the player must retrieve the Amulet of Yendor, found at the lowest level of the dungeon, and offer it to their deity. Successful completion of this task rewards the player with the gift of immortality, and the player is said to &quot;ascend&quot;, attaining the status of demigod. Along the path to the amulet, a number of sub-quests must be completed, including one class-specific quest.

There are three major antagonists in NetHack: the Luciferesque god Moloch, who stole the Amulet of Yendor from the creator god Marduk; the high priest (or priestess) of Moloch, who holds the Amulet of Yendor; and the most prominent antagonist, the Wizard of Yendor, who will stalk the player throughout the rest of the game after the first encounter by resurrecting and attacking them periodically. The game&#x27;s final bosses in the Astral Plane are the Riders: three of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Death, Famine and Pestilence. It is often proposed that the player character represents the fourth horseman, War.

The player&#x27;s character is, unless they opt not to be, accompanied by a pet animal, typically a kitten or little dog, although knights begin with a saddled pony. Pets grow from fighting, and they can be changed by various means. Most of the other monsters may also be tamed using magic or food.

===Dungeon levels===
&quot;NetHack&quot;&#x27;s dungeon spans about fifty primary levels, most of which are procedurally generated when the player character enters them for the first time. A typical level contains a way &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; to other levels. These may be stairways, ladders, trapdoors, etc. Levels also contain several &quot;rooms&quot; joined by corridors. These rooms are randomly generated rectangles (as opposed to the linear corridors) and may contain features such as altars, shops, fountains, traps, thrones, pools of water, and sinks based on the randomly generated features of the room. Some specific levels follow one of many fixed designs or contain fixed elements. Later versions of the game added special branches of dungeon levels. These are optional routes that may feature more challenging monsters but can reward more desirable treasure to complete the main dungeon. Levels, once generated, persist throughout a single game, in contrast to the non-persistent levels in &quot;Moria&quot;-style games.

===Items and tools===

&quot;NetHack&quot; features a variety of items: weapons (melee or ranged), armor to protect the player, scrolls and spellbooks to read, potions to , wands, rings, amulets, and an assortment of tools, such as keys and lamps.

&quot;NetHack&quot;&#x27;s identification of items is almost identical to &quot;Rogue&quot;&#x27;s. For example, a newly discovered potion may be referred to as a &quot;pink potion&quot; with no other clues as to its identity. Players can perform a variety of actions and tricks to deduce, or at least narrow down, the identity of the potion. The most obvious is the somewhat risky tactic of simply drinking it. All items of a certain type will have the same description. For instance, all &quot;scrolls of enchant weapon&quot; may be labeled &quot;TEMOV&quot;, and once one has been identified, all &quot;scrolls of enchant weapon&quot; found later will be labeled unambiguously as such. Starting a new game will scramble the items&#x27; descriptions again, so the &quot;silver ring&quot; that is a &quot;ring of levitation&quot; in one game might be a &quot;ring of hunger&quot; in another.

===Blessings and curses===
As in many other roguelike games, all items in &quot;NetHack&quot; are either &quot;blessed&quot;, &quot;uncursed&quot;, or &quot;cursed&quot;. The majority of items are found uncursed, but the blessed or cursed status of an item is unknown until it is identified or detected through other means. Such statuses can be changed (blessed to uncursed, uncursed to cursed, and vice versa) depending on player interaction.

Generally, a blessed item will be more powerful than an uncursed item, and a cursed item will be less powerful, with the added disadvantage that once it has been equipped by the player, it cannot be easily unequipped. Where an object would bestow an effect upon the character, a curse will generally make the effect harmful, or increase the amount of harm done. However, there are very specific exceptions. For example, drinking a cursed &quot;potion of gain level&quot; will make the character literally rise through the ceiling to the level above, instead of gaining an experience level.

===Character death===
As in other roguelike games, &quot;NetHack&quot; features permadeath: expired characters cannot be revived.

Although &quot;NetHack&quot; can be completed without any artificial limitations, experienced players can attempt &quot;conducts&quot; for an additional challenge. These are voluntary restrictions on actions taken, such as using no wishes, following a vegetarian or vegan diet, or even killing no monsters. While conducts are generally tracked by the game and are displayed at death or ascension, unofficial conducts are practiced within the community.

When a player dies, the cause of death and score is created and added to the list where the player&#x27;s character is ranked against other previous characters. The prompt &quot;Do you want your possessions identified?&quot; is given by default at the end of any game, allowing the player to learn any unknown properties of the items in their inventory at death. The player&#x27;s attributes (such as resistances, luck, and others), conduct (usually self-imposed challenges, such as playing as an atheist or a vegetarian), and a tally of creatures killed, may also be displayed.

The game sporadically saves a level on which a character has died and then integrates that level into a later game. This is done via &quot;bones files&quot;, which are saved on the computer hosting the game. A player using a publicly hosted copy of the game can thus encounter the remains and possessions of many other players, although many of these possessions may have become cursed.

Because of the numerous ways that a player-character could die between a combination of their own actions as well as from reactions from the game&#x27;s interacting systems, players frequently refer to untimely deaths as &quot;Yet Another Stupid Death&quot; (YASD). Such deaths are considered part of learning to play &quot;NetHack&quot; as to avoid conditions where the same death may happen again.

&quot;NetHack&quot; does allow players to save the game so that one does not have to complete the game in one session, but on opening a new game, the previous save file is subsequently wiped as to enforce the permadeath option. One option some players use is to make a backup copy of the save game file before playing a game, and, should their character die, restoring from the copied version, a practice known as &quot;save scumming&quot;. Additionally, players can also manipulate the &quot;bones files&quot; in a manner not intended by the developers. While these help the player to learn the game and get around limits of permadeath, both are considered forms of cheating the game.

===Culture around spoilers===
&quot;NetHack&quot; is largely based on discovering secrets and tricks during gameplay. It can take years for one to become well-versed in them, and even experienced players routinely discover new ones. A number of &quot;NetHack&quot; fan sites and discussion forums offer lists of game secrets known as &quot;spoilers&quot;.

===Interface===
&quot;NetHack&quot; was originally created with only a simple ASCII text-based user interface, although the option to use something more elaborate was added later in its development. Interface elements such as the environment, entities, and objects are represented by arrangements of ASCII or Extended ASCII glyphs, &quot;DECgraphics&quot;, or &quot;IBMgraphics&quot; mode. In addition to the environment, the interface also displays character and situational information.

A detailed example:
The player (the &#x27;@&#x27; sign, a wizard in this case) has entered the level via the stairs (the &#x27;&lt;&#x27; sign) and killed a few monsters, leaving their corpses (the &#x27;%&#x27; signs) behind. Exploring, the player has uncovered three rooms joined by corridors (the &#x27;#&#x27; signs): one with an altar (the &#x27;_&#x27; sign), another empty, and the final one (that the player is currently in) containing a potion (the &#x27;!&#x27; sign) and chest (the &#x27;(&#x27; sign). The player has just moved onto a square containing a silver ring. Parts of the level are still unexplored (probably accessible through the door to the west (the &#x27;+&#x27; sign)) and the player has yet to find the downstairs (a &#x27;&gt;&#x27; sign) to the next level.

Apart from the original termcap interface shown above, there are other interfaces that replace standard screen representations with two-dimensional images, or tiles, collectively known as &quot;tiles mode&quot;. Graphic interfaces of this kind have been successfully implemented on the Amiga, the X Window System, the Microsoft Windows GUI, the Qt toolkit, and the GNOME libraries.

Enhanced graphical options also exist, such as the isometric perspective of &quot;Falcon&#x27;s Eye&quot; and &quot;Vulture&#x27;s Eye&quot;, or the three-dimensional rendering that noegnud offers. &quot;Vulture&#x27;s Eye&quot; is a fork of the now defunct Falcon&#x27;s Eye project. &quot;Vulture&#x27;s Eye&quot; adds additional graphics, sounds, bug fixes and performance enhancements and is under active development in an open collaborative environment.

==History and development==

&quot;NetHack&quot; is a software derivative of &quot;Hack&quot;, which itself was inspired by &quot;Rogue&quot;. &quot;Hack&quot; was created by students Jay Fenlason, Kenny Woodland, Mike Thome, and Jonathan Payne at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School as part of a computer class, after seeing and playing &quot;Rogue&quot; at the University of California, Berkeley computer labs. The group had tried to get the source code of &quot;Rogue&quot; from Glenn Wichman and Michael Toy to build upon, but Wichman and Toy had refused, forcing the students to build the dungeon-creation routines on their own. As such, the game was named &quot;Hack&quot; in part for the hack-and-slash gameplay and that the code to generate the dungeons was considered a programming hack. After their classes ended, the students&#x27; work on the program also ended, though they had a working game. Fenlason provided the source code to a local USENIX conference, and eventually it was uploaded to USENET newsgroups. The code drew the attention of many players who started working to modify and improve the game as well as port it to other computer systems. &quot;Hack&quot; did not have any formal maintainer and while one person was generally recognized to hold the main code to the current version of &quot;Hack&quot;, many software forks emerged from the unorganized development of the game.

Eventually, Mike Stephenson took on the role as maintainer of the &quot;Hack&quot; source code. At this point, he decided to create a new fork of the game, bringing in novel ideas from Izchak Miller, a philosophy professor at University of Pennsylvania, and Janet Walz, another computer hacker. They called themselves the DevTeam and renamed their branch &quot;NetHack&quot; since their collaboration work was done over the Internet. They expanded the bestiary and other objects in the game, and drew from other sources outside of the high fantasy setting, such as from &quot;Discworld&quot; with the introduction of the tourist character class. Knowing of the multiple forks of &quot;Hack&quot; that existed, the DevTeam established a principle that while the game was open source and anyone could create a fork as a new project, only a few select members in the DevTeam could make modifications to the main source repository of the game, so that players could be assured that the DevTeam&#x27;s release was the legitimate version of &quot;NetHack&quot;.

===Release history===
The DevTeam&#x27;s first release of &quot;NetHack&quot; was on 28 July 1987.

The core DevTeam had expanded with the release of &quot;NetHack&quot; 3.0 in July 1989. By that point, they had established a tight-lipped culture, revealing little, if anything, between releases. Owing to the ever-increasing depth and complexity found in each release, the development team enjoys a near-mythical status among fans. This perceived omniscience is captured in the initialism TDTTOE, &quot;The DevTeam Thinks of Everything&quot;, in that many of the possible emergent gameplay elements that could occur due to the behavior of the complex game systems had already been programmed in by the DevTeam. Since version 3.0, the DevTeam has typically kept to minor bug fix updates, represented by a change in the third version number (e.g. v3.0.1 over v3.0.0), and only releases major updates (v3.1.0 over v3.0.0) when significant new features are added to the game, including support for new platforms. Many of those from the community that helped with the ports to other systems were subsequently invited to be part of the DevTeam as the team&#x27;s needs grew, with Stephenson remaining the key member currently.

Updates to the game were generally regular from around 1987 through 2003, with the DevTeam releasing v3.4.3 in December 2003. Subsequent updates from the DevTeam included new tilesets and compatibility with variants of Mac OS, but no major updates to the game had been made. In the absence of new releases from the developers, several community-made updates to the code and variants developed by fans emerged.

On 7 December 2015, version 3.6.0 was released, the first major release in over a decade. While the patch did not add major new gameplay features, the update was designed to prepare the game for expansion in the future, with the DevTeam&#x27;s patch notes stating: &quot;This release consists of a series of foundational changes in the team, underlying infrastructure and changes to the approach to game development&quot;. Stephenson said that despite the number of roguelike titles that had emerged since the v3.4.3 release, they saw that &quot;NetHack&quot; was still being talked about online in part due to its high degree of portability, and decided to continue its development. According to DevTeam member Paul Winner, they looked to evaluate what community features had been introduced in the prior decade to improve the game while maintaining the necessary balance. The update came shortly after the death of Terry Pratchett, whose &quot;Discworld&quot; had been influential on the game, and the new update included a tribute to him. With the v3.6.0 release, &quot;NetHack&quot; remains &quot;one of the oldest games still being developed&quot;.

A public read-only mirror of &quot;NetHack&quot; git repository was made available on 10 February 2016. Since v3.6.0, the DevTeam has continued to push updates to the title, with the latest being v3.6.7 on 16 February 2023. Version 3.7.0 is currently in development.

, the official source release supports the following systems: Windows, Linux, macOS, Windows CE, OS/2, Unix (BSD, System V, Solaris, HP-UX), BeOS, and VMS.

===Licensing, ports, and derivative ports===

&quot;NetHack&quot; is released under the NetHack General Public License, which was written in 1989 by Mike Stephenson, patterned after the GNU bison license (which was written by Richard Stallman in 1988). Like the Bison license, and Stallman&#x27;s later GNU General Public License, the &quot;NetHack&quot; license was written to allow the free sharing and modification of the source code under its protection. At the same time, the license explicitly states that the source code is not covered by any warranty, thus protecting the original authors from litigation. The NetHack General Public License is a copyleft software license certified as an open source license by the Open Source Initiative.

The NetHack General Public License allows anyone to port the game to a platform not supported by the official DevTeam, provided that they use the same license. Over the years this licensing has led to a large number of ports and internationalized versions in German, Japanese, and Spanish. The license also allows for software forks as long as they are distributed under the same license, except that the creator of a derivative work is allowed to offer warranty protection on the new work. The derivative work is required to indicate the modifications made and the dates of changes. In addition, the source code of the derivative work must be made available, free of charge except for nominal distribution fees. This has also allowed source code forks of &quot;NetHack&quot; including &quot;Slash&#x27;EM&quot;, &quot;UnNetHack&quot;, and &quot;dNethack&quot;.

==Online support==
Bugs, humorous messages, stories, experiences, and ideas for the next version are discussed on the Usenet newsgroup rec.games.roguelike.nethack.

A public server at nethack.alt.org, commonly known as &quot;NAO&quot;, gives players access to NetHack through a Telnet or SSH interface. A browser-based client is also available on the same site. Ebonhack connects to NAO with a graphical tiles-based interface.

During the whole month of November, the annual /dev/null NetHack Tournament took place every year from 1999 to 2016. The November NetHack Tournament, initially conceived as a one-time tribute to devnull, has taken place each year since 2018. The Junethack Cross-Variant Summer Tournament has taken place annually since 2011.

==NetHack Learning Environment==
The Facebook artificial intelligence (AI) research team, along with researchers at the University of Oxford, New York University, the Imperial College London, and University College London, developed an open-source platform called the NetHack Learning Environment, designed to teach AI agents to play &quot;NetHack&quot;. The base environment is able to maneuver the agent and fight its way through dungeons, but the team seeks community help to build an AI on the complexities of &quot;NetHack&quot; interconnected systems, using implicit knowledge that comes from player-made resources, thus giving a means for programmers to hook into the environment with additional resources. Facebook&#x27;s research led the company to pose &quot;NetHack&quot; as a grand challenge in AI in June 2021, in part due to the game&#x27;s permadeath and inability to experiment with the environment without creating a reaction. The competition at the 2021 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems involved agents of various designs attempting to ascend. None of the agents managed this; the results were ranked by median in-game score, with the highest-ranked agent (Team AutoAscend) using a symbolic (non-machine-learning) design.

==Legacy==
&quot;NetHack&quot; has influenced &quot;ADOM&quot;, &quot;Minecraft&quot;, &quot;Spelunky&quot;, &quot;Diablo&quot; and &quot;Mystery Dungeon&quot;. The game was part of the video game exhibit &quot;Never Alone&quot;, in the Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s collection, which ran from September 2022 to July 2023.

<text>Nylon is a family of synthetic polymers characterized by amide linkages, typically connecting aliphatic or semi-aromatic groups.

Nylons are generally white or colorless and possess a soft texture, with some varieties exhibiting a silk-like appearance. As thermoplastics, nylons can be melt-processed into fibers, films, and diverse shapes. The properties of nylons are often modified by blending with a variety of additives.

Numerous types of nylon are available. One family, designated nylon-XY, is derived from diamines and dicarboxylic acids of carbon chain lengths X and Y, respectively. An important example is nylon-6,6 (). Another family, designated nylon-Z, is derived from aminocarboxylic acids with carbon chain length Z. An example is nylon-[6].

Nylon polymers have extensive commercial applications, including uses in textiles and fibers (such as apparel, flooring and rubber reinforcement), molded components for automotive and electrical equipment, and films (mostly for food packaging).

== History ==
=== DuPont and the invention of nylon ===
Researchers at DuPont began developing cellulose-based fibers, culminating in the synthetic fiber rayon. DuPont&#x27;s experience with rayon was an important precursor to its development and marketing of nylon.

DuPont&#x27;s invention of nylon spanned an eleven-year period, ranging from the initial research program in polymers in 1927 to its announcement in 1938, shortly before the opening of the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The project grew from a new organizational structure at DuPont, suggested by Charles Stine in 1927, in which the chemical department would be composed of several small research teams that would focus on &quot;pioneering research&quot; in chemistry and would &quot;lead to practical applications&quot;. Harvard instructor Wallace Hume Carothers was hired to direct the polymer research group. Initially he was allowed to focus on pure research, building on and testing the theories of German chemist Hermann Staudinger. He was very successful, as research he undertook greatly improved the knowledge of polymers and contributed to the science.

Nylon was the first commercially successful synthetic thermoplastic polymer. DuPont began its research project in 1927.
The first nylon, nylon 66, was synthesized on February 28, 1935, by Wallace Hume Carothers at DuPont&#x27;s research facility at the DuPont Experimental Station. In response to Carothers&#x27; work, Paul Schlack at IG Farben developed nylon 6, a different molecule based on caprolactam, on January 29, 1938.

In the spring of 1930, Carothers and his team had already synthesized two new polymers. One was neoprene, a synthetic rubber greatly used during World War II. The other was a white elastic but strong paste that would later become nylon. After these discoveries, Carothers&#x27; team was made to shift its research from a more pure research approach investigating general polymerization to a more practically focused goal of finding &quot;one chemical combination that would lend itself to industrial applications&quot;.

It was not until the beginning of 1935 that a polymer called &quot;polymer 6-6&quot; was finally produced. Carothers&#x27; coworker, Washington University alumnus Julian W. Hill had used a cold drawing method to produce a polyester in 1930. This cold drawing method was later used by Carothers in 1935 to fully develop nylon. The first example of nylon (nylon 6.6) was produced on February 28, 1935, at DuPont&#x27;s research facility at the DuPont Experimental Station. It had all the desired properties of elasticity and strength. However, it also required a complex manufacturing process that would become the basis of industrial production in the future. DuPont obtained a patent for the polymer in September 1938, and quickly achieved a monopoly of the fiber. Carothers died 16 months before the announcement of nylon, therefore he was never able to see his success.

Nylon was first used commercially in a nylon-bristled toothbrush in 1938, followed more famously in women&#x27;s stockings or &quot;nylons&quot; which were shown at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair and first sold commercially in 1940, whereupon they became an instant commercial success with 64 million pairs sold during their first year on the market. During World War II, almost all nylon production was diverted to the military for use in parachutes and parachute cord. Wartime uses of nylon and other plastics greatly increased the market for the new materials.

The production of nylon required interdepartmental collaboration between three departments at DuPont: the Department of Chemical Research, the Ammonia Department, and the Department of Rayon. Some of the key ingredients of nylon had to be produced using high pressure chemistry, the main area of expertise of the Ammonia Department. Nylon was considered a &quot;godsend to the Ammonia Department&quot;, which had been in financial difficulties. The reactants of nylon soon constituted half of the Ammonia Department&#x27;s sales and helped them come out of the period of the Great Depression by creating jobs and revenue at DuPont.

DuPont&#x27;s nylon project demonstrated the importance of chemical engineering in industry, helped create jobs, and furthered the advancement of chemical engineering techniques. In fact, it developed a chemical plant that provided 1800 jobs and used the latest technologies of the time, which are still used as a model for chemical plants today. The ability to acquire a large number of chemists and engineers quickly was a huge contribution to the success of DuPont&#x27;s nylon project. The first nylon plant was located at Seaford, Delaware, beginning commercial production on December 15, 1939. On October 26, 1995, the Seaford plant was designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society.

=== Early marketing strategies ===

An important part of nylon&#x27;s popularity stems from DuPont&#x27;s marketing strategy. DuPont promoted the fiber to increase demand before the product was available to the general market. Nylon&#x27;s commercial announcement occurred on October 27, 1938, at the final session of the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;″s yearly &quot;Forum on Current Problems&quot;, on the site of the approaching New York City world&#x27;s fair. The &quot;first man-made organic textile fiber&quot; which was derived from &quot;coal, water and air&quot; and promised to be &quot;as strong as steel, as fine as the spider&#x27;s web&quot; was received enthusiastically by the audience, many of them middle-class women, and made the headlines of most newspapers. Nylon was introduced as part of &quot;The world of tomorrow&quot; at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair and was featured at DuPont&#x27;s &quot;Wonder World of Chemistry&quot; at the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco in 1939. Actual nylon stockings were not shipped to selected stores in the national market until May 15, 1940. However, a limited number were released for sale in Delaware before that. The first public sale of nylon stockings occurred on October 24, 1939, in Wilmington, Delaware. 4,000 pairs of stockings were available, all of which were sold within three hours.

Another added bonus to the campaign was that it meant reducing silk imports from Japan, an argument that won over many wary customers. Nylon was even mentioned by President Roosevelt&#x27;s cabinet, which addressed its &quot;vast and interesting economic possibilities&quot; five days after the material was formally announced.

However, the early excitement over nylon also caused problems. It fueled unreasonable expectations that nylon would be better than silk, a miracle fabric as strong as steel that would last forever and never run. Realizing the danger of claims such as &quot;New Hosiery Held Strong as Steel&quot; and &quot;No More Runs&quot;, DuPont scaled back the terms of the original announcement, especially those stating that nylon would possess the strength of steel.

Also, DuPont executives marketing nylon as a revolutionary man-made material did not at first realize that some consumers experienced a sense of unease and distrust, even fear, towards synthetic fabrics. A particularly damaging news story, drawing on DuPont&#x27;s 1938 patent for the new polymer, suggested that one method of producing nylon might be to use cadaverine (pentamethylenediamine), a chemical extracted from corpses. Although scientists asserted that cadaverine was also extracted by heating coal, the public often refused to listen. A woman confronted one of the lead scientists at DuPont and refused to accept that the rumour was not true.

DuPont changed its campaign strategy, emphasizing that nylon was made from &quot;coal, air and water&quot;, and started focusing on the personal and aesthetic aspects of nylon, rather than its intrinsic qualities. Nylon was thus domesticated, and attention shifted to the material and consumer aspect of the fiber with slogans like &quot;If it&#x27;s nylon, it&#x27;s prettier, and oh! How fast it dries!&quot;.

=== Production of nylon fabric ===
After nylon&#x27;s nationwide release in 1940, its production ramped up significantly. In that year alone, 1300 tons of the fabric were produced, marking a remarkable start for this innovative material.[8]: 100  The demand for nylon surged, particularly for nylon stockings, which became an instant sensation. During their first year on the market, an astounding 64 million pairs of nylon stockings were sold, reflecting the fabric&#x27;s rapid integration into daily life and fashion.[8]: 101  Such was the success of nylon that in 1941, just a year after its launch, a second plant was opened in Martinsville, Virginia, to meet the growing demand and ensure a steady supply of this popular fabric. This expansion underscored the profound impact nylon had on the textile industry and its rapid rise to prominence as a versatile and sought-after material.

While nylon was marketed as the durable and indestructible material of the people, it was sold at about one-and-a-half times the price of silk stockings ($4.27 per pound of nylon versus $2.79 per pound of silk). Sales of nylon stockings were strong in part due to changes in women&#x27;s fashion. As Lauren Olds explains: &quot;by 1939 [hemlines] had inched back up to the knee, closing the decade just as it started off&quot;. The shorter skirts were accompanied by a demand for stockings that offered fuller coverage without the use of garters to hold them up.

However, as of February 11, 1942, nylon production was redirected from being a consumer material to one used by the military. DuPont&#x27;s production of nylon stockings and other lingerie stopped, and most manufactured nylon was used to make parachutes and tents for World War II. Although nylon stockings already made before the war could be purchased, they were generally sold on the black market for as high as $20.

Once the war ended, the return of nylon was awaited with great anticipation. Although DuPont projected yearly production of 360 million pairs of stockings, there were delays in converting back to consumer rather than wartime production. In 1946, the demand for nylon stockings could not be satisfied, which led to the nylon riots. In one instance, an estimated 40,000 people lined up in Pittsburgh to buy 13,000 pairs of nylons. In the meantime, women cut up nylon tents and parachutes left from the war in order to make blouses and wedding dresses. Between the end of the war and 1952, production of stockings and lingerie used 80% of the world&#x27;s nylon. DuPont put focus on catering to the civilian demand, and continually expanded its production.

=== Introduction of nylon blends ===

As pure nylon hosiery was sold in a wider market, problems became apparent. Nylon stockings were found to be fragile, in the sense that the thread often tended to unravel lengthwise, creating &#x27;runs&#x27;. People also reported that pure nylon textiles could be uncomfortable due to nylon&#x27;s lack of absorbency. Moisture stayed inside the fabric near the skin under hot or moist conditions instead of being &quot;wicked&quot; away. Nylon fabric could also be itchy and tended to cling and sometimes spark as a result of static electrical charge built up by friction. Also, under some conditions, nylon could degrade, perforating or shredding stockings. Scientists explained this as acid hydrolysis resulting from air pollution, attributing it to London smog in 1952, as well as poor air quality in New York and Los Angeles.

The solution found to problems with pure nylon fabric was to blend nylon with other existing fibers or polymers such as cotton, polyester, and spandex. This led to the development of a wide array of blended fabrics. The new nylon blends retained the desirable properties of nylon (elasticity, durability, ability to be dyed) and kept clothes prices low and affordable. As of 1950, the New York Quartermaster Procurement Agency (NYQMPA), which developed and tested textiles for the Army and Navy, had committed to developing a wool-nylon blend. They were not the only ones to introduce blends of both natural and synthetic fibers. &quot;America&#x27;s Textile Reporter&quot; referred to 1951 as the &quot;Year of the blending of the fibers&quot;. Fabric blends included mixes like &quot;Bunara&quot; (wool-rabbit-nylon) and &quot;Casmet&quot; (wool-nylon-fur). In Britain, in November 1951, the inaugural address of the 198th session of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce focused on the blending of textiles.

DuPont&#x27;s Fabric Development Department cleverly targeted French fashion designers, supplying them with fabric samples. In 1955, designers such as Coco Chanel, Jean Patou, and Christian Dior showed gowns created with DuPont fibers, and fashion photographer Horst P. Horst was hired to document their use of DuPont fabrics. &quot;American Fabrics&quot; credited blends with providing &quot;creative possibilities and new ideas for fashions which had been hitherto undreamed of.&quot;

=== Etymology ===

DuPont went through an extensive process to generate names for its new product. In 1940, John W. Eckelberry of DuPont stated that the letters &quot;nyl&quot; were arbitrary, and the &quot;on&quot; was copied from the suffixes of other fibers such as cotton and rayon. A later publication by DuPont (&quot;Context&quot;, vol. 7, no. 2, 1978) explained that the name was originally intended to be &quot;No-Run&quot; (&quot;run&quot; meaning &quot;unravel&quot;) but was modified to avoid making such an unjustified claim. Since the products were not really run-proof, the vowels were swapped to produce &quot;nuron&quot;, which was changed to &quot;nilon&quot; &quot;to make it sound less like a nerve tonic&quot;. For clarity in pronunciation, the &quot;i&quot; was changed to &quot;y&quot;.

A persistent urban legend exists that the name is derived from &quot;New York&quot; and &quot;London&quot;; however, no organisation in London was ever involved in the research and production of nylon.

=== Longer-term popularity ===
Nylon’s popularity soared in the 1940s and 1950s due to its durability and sheerness. In the 1970s, it became more popular due to its flexibility and price.

In spite of oil shortages in the 1970s, consumption of nylon textiles continued to grow by 7.5% per year between the 1960s and 1980s. Overall production of synthetic fibers, however, dropped from 63% of the worlds textile production in 1965, to 45% of the world&#x27;s textile production in early 1970s. The appeal of &quot;new&quot; technologies wore off, and nylon fabric &quot;was going out of style in the 1970s&quot;. Also, consumers became concerned about environmental costs throughout the production cycle: obtaining the raw materials (oil), energy use during production, waste produced during creation of the fiber, and eventual waste disposal of materials that were not biodegradable. 
Synthetic fibers have not dominated the market since the 1950s and 1960s. , the worldwide production of nylon is estimated at 8.9 million tons.

Although pure nylon has many flaws and is now rarely used, its derivatives have greatly influenced and contributed to society. From scientific discoveries relating to the production of plastics and polymerization, to economic impact during the depression and the changing of women&#x27;s fashion, nylon was a revolutionary product. The Lunar Flag Assembly, the first flag planted on the moon in a symbolic gesture of celebration, was made of nylon. The flag itself cost $5.50 but had to have a specially designed flagpole with a horizontal bar so that it would appear to &quot;fly&quot;. One historian describes nylon as &quot;an object of desire&quot;, comparing the invention to Coca-Cola in the eyes of 20th century consumers.

== Chemistry ==
In common usage, the prefix &quot;PA&quot; (polyamide) or the name &quot;Nylon&quot; are used interchangeably and are equivalent in meaning.

The nomenclature used for nylon polymers was devised during the synthesis of the first simple aliphatic nylons and uses numbers to describe the number of carbons in each monomer unit, including the carbon(s) of the carboxylic acid(s). Subsequent use of cyclic and aromatic monomers required the use of letters or sets of letters. One number after &quot;PA&quot; or &quot;Nylon&quot; indicates a homopolymer which is &quot;monadic&quot; or based on one amino acid (minus H2O) as monomer:
: PA 6 or Nylon 6: [NH−(CH2)5−CO]&quot;n&quot; made from ε-caprolactam.

Two numbers or sets of letters indicate a &quot;dyadic&quot; homopolymer formed from two monomers: one diamine and one dicarboxylic acid. The first number indicates the number of carbons in the diamine. The two numbers should be separated by a comma for clarity, but the comma is often omitted.
: PA or Nylon 6,10 (or 610): [NH−(CH2)6−NH−CO−(CH2)8−CO]&quot;n&quot; made from hexamethylenediamine and sebacic acid;

For copolymers the comonomers or pairs of comonomers are separated by slashes:
: PA 6/66: [NH−(CH2)6−NH−CO−(CH2)4−CO]&quot;n&quot;−[NH−(CH2)5−CO]&quot;m&quot; made from caprolactam, hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid;
: PA 66/610: [NH−(CH2)6−NH−CO−(CH2)4−CO]&quot;n&quot;−[NH−(CH2)6−NH−CO−(CH2)8−CO]&quot;m&quot; made from hexamethylenediamine, adipic acid and sebacic acid.

The term polyphthalamide (abbreviated to PPA) is used when 60% or more moles of the carboxylic acid portion of the repeating unit in the polymer chain is composed of a combination of terephthalic acid (TPA) and isophthalic acid (IPA).

== Types ==

=== Nylon 66 and related heteropolymers ===
Nylon 66 and related polyamides are condensation polymers forms from equal parts of diamine and dicarboxylic acids. In the first case, the &quot;repeating unit&quot; has the ABAB structure, as also seen in many polyesters and polyurethanes. Since each monomer in this copolymer has the same reactive group on both ends, the direction of the amide bond reverses between each monomer, unlike natural polyamide proteins, which have overall directionality: C terminal → N terminal. In the second case (so called AA), the repeating unit corresponds to the single monomer.

Wallace Carothers at DuPont patented nylon 66. 
In the case of nylons that involve reaction of a diamine and a dicarboxylic acid, it is difficult to get the proportions exactly correct, and deviations can lead to chain termination at molecular weights less than a desirable 10,000 daltons. To overcome this problem, a crystalline, solid &quot;nylon salt&quot; can be formed at room temperature, using an exact 1:1 ratio of the acid and the base to neutralize each other. The salt is crystallized to purify it and obtain the desired precise stoichiometry. Heated to 285 °C (545 °F), the salt reacts to form nylon polymer with the production of water.

Nylon 510, made from pentamethylene diamine and sebacic acid, was included in the Carothers patent to nylon 66 Nylon 610 is produced similarly using hexamethylene diamine. These materials are more expensive because of the relatively high cost of sebacic acid. Owing to the high hydrocarbon content, nylon 610 is more hydrophobic and finds applications suited for this property, such as bristles.


Examples of these polymers that are or were commercially available:
* PA46 DSM Stanyl
* PA410 DSM Ecopaxx
* PA4T DSM Four Tii
* PA66 DuPont Zytel

=== Nylon 6 and related homopolymers ===
These polymers are made from a lactam or amino acid. The synthetic route using lactams (cyclic amides) was developed by Paul Schlack at IG Farben, leading to nylon 6, or polycaprolactam—formed by a ring-opening polymerization. The peptide bond within the caprolactam is broken with the exposed active groups on each side being incorporated into two new bonds as the monomer becomes part of the polymer backbone.

The 428 °F (220 °C) melting point of nylon 6 is lower than the 509 °F (265 °C) melting point of nylon 66. Homopolymer nylons are derived from one monomer.

Examples of these polymers that are or were commercially available:
* PA6 Lanxess Durethan B
* PA11 Arkema Rilsan
* PA12 Evonik Vestamid L

=== Nylon 1,6 ===
Nylons can also be synthesized from dinitriles using acid catalysis. For example, this method is applicable for preparation of nylon 1,6 from adiponitrile, formaldehyde and water. Additionally, nylons can be synthesized from diols and dinitriles using this method as well.

=== Copolymers ===

It is easy to make mixtures of the monomers or sets of monomers used to make nylons to obtain copolymers. This lowers crystallinity and can therefore lower the melting point.

Some copolymers that have been or are commercially available are listed below: 
* PA6/66 DuPont Zytel
* PA6/6T BASF Ultramid T (6/6T copolymer)
* PA6I/6T DuPont Selar PA
* PA66/6T DuPont Zytel HTN
* PA12/MACMI EMS Grilamid TR

=== Blends ===

Most nylon polymers are miscible with each other allowing a range of blends to be made. The two polymers can react with one another by transamidation to form random copolymers.

=== Crystallinity===
According to their crystallinity, polyamides can be:
* semi-crystalline: 
** high crystallinity: PA46 and PA66;
** low crystallinity: PAMXD6 made from m-xylylenediamine and adipic acid;
* amorphous: PA6I made from hexamethylenediamine and isophthalic acid.

According to this classification, PA66, for example, is an aliphatic semi-crystalline homopolyamide.

== Environmental impact ==
All nylons are susceptible to hydrolysis, especially by strong acids, a reaction essentially the reverse of their synthesis. The molecular weight of nylon products so attacked drops, and cracks form quickly at the affected zones. Lower members of the nylons (such as nylon 6) are affected more than higher members such as nylon 12. This means that nylon parts cannot be used in contact with sulfuric acid for example, such as the electrolyte used in lead–acid batteries.

When being molded, nylon must be dried to prevent hydrolysis in the molding machine barrel since water at high temperatures can also degrade the polymer. The reaction is shown above.

The average greenhouse gas footprint of nylon in manufacturing carpets is estimated at 5.43 kg CO2 equivalent per kg, when produced in Europe. This gives it almost the same carbon footprint as wool, but with greater durability and therefore a lower overall carbon footprint.

Data published by PlasticsEurope indicates for nylon 66 a greenhouse gas footprint of 6.4 kg CO2 equivalent per kg, and an energy consumption of 138 kJ/kg. When considering the environmental impact of nylon, it is important to consider the use phase.

Various nylons break down in fire and form hazardous smoke, and toxic fumes or ash, typically containing hydrogen cyanide. Incinerating nylons to recover the high energy used to create them is usually expensive, so most nylons reach the garbage dumps, decaying slowly. Discarded nylon fabric takes 30–40 years to decompose. Nylon used in discarded fishing gear such as fishing nets is a contributor to debris in the ocean. Nylon is a robust polymer and lends itself well to recycling. Much nylon resin is recycled directly in a closed loop at the injection molding machine, by grinding sprues and runners and mixing them with the virgin granules being consumed by the molding machine.

Because of the expense and difficulties of the nylon recycling process, few companies utilize it while most favor using cheaper, newly made plastics for their products instead. US clothing company Patagonia has products containing recycled nylon and in the mid-2010s invested in Bureo, a company that recycles nylon from used fishing nets to use in sunglasses and skateboards. The Italian company Aquafil also has demonstrated recycling fishing nets lost in the ocean into apparel. Vanden Recycling recycles nylon and other polyamides (PA) and has operations in the UK, Australia, Hong Kong, the UAE, Turkey and Finland.

Nylon is the most popular fiber type in the residential carpet industry today. The US EPA estimates that 9.2% of carpet fiber, backing and padding was recycled in 2018, 17.8% was incinerated in waste-to-energy facilities, and 73% was discarded in landfills. Some of the world&#x27;s largest carpet and rug companies are promoting &quot;cradle to cradle&quot;—the re-use of non-virgin materials including ones not historically recycled—as the industry&#x27;s pathway forward.

== Properties ==

Above their melting temperatures, &quot;T&quot;m, thermoplastics like nylon are amorphous solids or viscous fluids in which the chains approximate random coils. Below &quot;T&quot;m, amorphous regions alternate with regions which are lamellar crystals. The amorphous regions contribute elasticity, and the crystalline regions contribute strength and rigidity. The planar amide (-CO-NH-) groups are very polar, so nylon forms multiple hydrogen bonds among adjacent strands. Because the nylon backbone is so regular and symmetrical, especially if all the amide bonds are in the &quot;trans&quot; configuration, nylons often have high crystallinity and make excellent fibers. The amount of crystallinity depends on the details of formation, as well as on the kind of nylon.

Nylon 66 can have multiple parallel strands aligned with their neighboring peptide bonds at coordinated separations of exactly six and four carbons for considerable lengths, so the carbonyl oxygens and amide hydrogens can line up to form interchain hydrogen bonds repeatedly, without interruption (see the figure opposite). Nylon 510 can have coordinated runs of five and eight carbons. Thus parallel (but not antiparallel) strands can participate in extended, unbroken, multi-chain β-pleated sheets, a strong and tough supermolecular structure similar to that found in natural silk fibroin and the β-keratins in feathers. (Proteins have only an amino acid α-carbon separating sequential -CO-NH- groups.) Nylon 6 will form uninterrupted H-bonded sheets with mixed directionalities, but the β-sheet wrinkling is somewhat different. The three-dimensional disposition of each alkane hydrocarbon chain depends on rotations about the 109.47° tetrahedral bonds of singly bonded carbon atoms.

When extruded into fibers through pores in an industry spinneret, the individual polymer chains tend to align because of viscous flow. If subjected to cold drawing afterwards, the fibers align further, increasing their crystallinity, and the material acquires additional tensile strength. In practice, nylon fibers are most often drawn using heated rolls at high speeds.

Block nylon tends to be less crystalline, except near the surfaces due to shearing stresses during formation. Nylon is clear and colorless, or milky, but is easily dyed. Multistranded nylon cord and rope is slippery and tends to unravel. The ends can be melted and fused with a heat source such as a flame or electrode to prevent this.

Nylons are hygroscopic and will absorb or desorb moisture as a function of the ambient humidity. Variations in moisture content have several effects on the polymer. Firstly, the dimensions will change, but more importantly moisture acts as a plasticizer, lowering the glass transition temperature (&quot;T&quot;g), and consequently the elastic modulus at temperatures below the &quot;T&quot;g

When dry, polyamide is a good electrical insulator. However, polyamide is hygroscopic. The absorption of water will change some of the material&#x27;s properties such as its electrical resistance. Nylon is less absorbent than wool or cotton.

The characteristic features of nylon 66 include:
* Pleats and creases can be heat-set at higher temperatures
* More compact molecular structure
* Better weathering properties; better sunlight resistance
* Softer &quot;Hand&quot;
* High melting point (256 °C, 492.8 °F)
* Superior colorfastness
* Excellent abrasion resistance

On the other hand, nylon 6 is easy to dye, more readily fades; it has a higher impact resistance, a more rapid moisture absorption, greater elasticity, and elastic recovery.
* Variation of luster: nylon has the ability to be very lustrous, semi-lustrous, or dull.
* Durability: its high tenacity fibers are used for seatbelts, tire cords, ballistic cloth, and other uses.
* High elongation
* Excellent abrasion resistance
* Highly resilient (nylon fabrics are heat-set)
* Paved the way for easy-care garments
* High resistance to insects, fungi, animals, as well as molds, mildew, rot, and many chemicals
* Used in carpets and nylon stockings
* Melts instead of burning
* Used in many military applications
* Good specific strength
* Transparent to infrared light (−12 dB)

Nylon clothing tends to be less flammable than cotton and rayon, but nylon fibers may melt and stick to skin.

== Uses ==

Nylon was first used commercially in a nylon-bristled toothbrush in 1938, followed more famously in women&#x27;s stockings or &quot;nylons&quot; which were shown at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair and first sold commercially in 1940. Its use increased dramatically during World War II, when the need for fabrics increased dramatically.

=== Fibers ===

Bill Pittendreigh, DuPont, and other individuals and corporations worked diligently during the first few months of World War II to find a way to replace Asian silk and hemp with nylon in parachutes. It was also used to make tires, tents, ropes, ponchos, and other military supplies. It was even used in the production of a high-grade paper for U.S. currency. At the outset of the war, cotton accounted for more than 80% of all fibers used and manufactured, and wool fibers accounted for nearly all of the rest. By August 1945, manufactured fibers had taken a market share of 25%, at the expense of cotton. After the war, because of shortages of both silk and nylon, nylon parachute material was sometimes repurposed to make dresses.

Nylon 6 and 66 fibers are used in carpet manufacture.

Nylon is one kind of fiber used in tire cord. Herman E. Schroeder pioneered application of nylon in tires.

=== Molds and resins ===

Nylon resins are widely used in the automobile industry especially in the engine compartment.

Molded nylon is used in hair combs and mechanical parts such as machine screws, gears, gaskets, and other low- to medium-stress components previously cast in metal. Engineering-grade nylon is processed by extrusion, casting, and injection molding. Type 6,6 Nylon 101 is the most common commercial grade of nylon, and Nylon 6 is the most common commercial grade of molded nylon. For use in tools such as spudgers, nylon is available in glass-filled variants which increase structural and impact strength and rigidity, and molybdenum disulfide-filled variants which increase lubricity. Nylon can be used as the matrix material in composite materials, with reinforcing fibers like glass or carbon fiber; such a composite has a higher density than pure nylon. Such thermoplastic composites (25% to 30% glass fiber) are frequently used in car components next to the engine, such as intake manifolds, where the good heat resistance of such materials makes them feasible competitors to metals.

Nylon was used to make the stock of the Remington Nylon 66 rifle. The frame of the modern Glock pistol is made of a nylon composite.

=== Food packaging ===

Nylon resins are used as a component of food packaging films where an oxygen barrier is needed. Some of the terpolymers based upon nylon are used every day in packaging. Nylon has been used for meat wrappings and sausage sheaths. The high temperature resistance of nylon makes it useful for oven bags.

=== Filaments ===

Nylon filaments are primarily used in brushes especially toothbrushes and string trimmers. They are also used as monofilaments in fishing line. Nylon 610 and 612 are the most used polymers for filaments.

Its various properties also make it very useful as a material in additive manufacturing; specifically, as a filament in consumer and professional grade fused deposition modeling 3D printers.

=== Other forms ===

Nylon resins can be extruded into rods, tubes, and sheets.

Nylon powders are used to powder coat metals. Nylon 11 and nylon 12 are the most widely used.

In the mid-1940s, classical guitarist Andrés Segovia mentioned the shortage of good guitar strings in the United States, particularly his favorite Pirastro catgut strings, to a number of foreign diplomats at a party, including General Lindeman of the British Embassy. A month later, the General presented Segovia with some nylon strings which he had obtained via some members of the DuPont family. Segovia found that although the strings produced a clear sound, they had a faint metallic timbre which he hoped could be eliminated. Nylon strings were first tried on stage by Olga Coelho in New York in January 1944. In 1946, Segovia and string maker Albert Augustine were introduced by their mutual friend Vladimir Bobri, editor of Guitar Review. On the basis of Segovia&#x27;s interest and Augustine&#x27;s past experiments, they decided to pursue the development of nylon strings. DuPont, skeptical of the idea, agreed to supply the nylon if Augustine would endeavor to develop and produce the actual strings. After three years of development, Augustine demonstrated a nylon first string whose quality impressed guitarists, including Segovia, in addition to DuPont. Wound strings, however, were more problematic. Eventually, however, after experimenting with various types of metal and smoothing and polishing techniques, Augustine was also able to produce high quality nylon wound strings.

<text>A nerd is a person seen as overly intellectual, obsessive, introverted, or lacking social skills. Such a person may spend inordinate amounts of time on unpopular, little known, or non-mainstream activities, which are generally either highly technical, abstract, or relating to niche topics such as science fiction or fantasy, to the exclusion of more mainstream activities. Additionally, many so-called nerds are described as being shy, quirky, pedantic, and unattractive.

Originally derogatory, the term &quot;nerd&quot; was a stereotype, but as with other pejoratives, it has been reclaimed and redefined by some as a term of pride and group identity.

==Etymology==
The first documented appearance of the word &quot;nerd&quot; is as the name of a creature in Dr. Seuss&#x27;s book &quot;If I Ran the Zoo&quot; (1950), in which the narrator Gerald McGrew claims that he would collect &quot;a Nerkle, a Nerd, and a Seersucker too&quot; for his imaginary zoo. The slang meaning of the term dates to 1951. That year, &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine reported on its popular use as a synonym for &quot;&quot; or &quot;square&quot; in Detroit, Michigan. By the early 1960s, usage of the term had spread throughout the United States, and even as far as Scotland. At some point, the word took on connotations of bookishness and social ineptitude.

An alternate spelling, as &quot;nurd&quot; or &quot;gnurd&quot;, also began to appear in the mid-1960s, or early 1970s. Author Philip K. Dick claimed to have coined the &quot;nurd&quot; spelling in 1973, but its first recorded use appeared in a 1965 student publication at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). Oral tradition there holds that the word is derived from &quot;knurd&quot; (&quot;drunk&quot; spelled backwards), which was used to describe people who studied rather than partied. The term &quot;gnurd&quot; (spelled with the &quot;g&quot;) was in use at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) by the year 1965. The term &quot;nurd&quot; was also in use at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as early as 1971.

According to &quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot;, the word is an alteration of the 1940s term &quot;nert&quot; (meaning &quot;stupid or crazy person&quot;), which is in itself an alteration of &quot;&quot; (nutcase).

The term was popularized in the 1970s by its heavy use in the sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot;.

==Culture==
===Stereotype===
Because of the nerd stereotype, many intelligent people are often thought of as nerdy. This belief can be harmful, as it can cause high-school students to &quot;switch off their lights&quot; out of fear of being branded as a nerd, and cause otherwise appealing people to be considered nerdy simply for their intellect. It was once thought that intellectuals were nerdy because they were envied. However, Paul Graham stated in his essay, &quot;Why Nerds are Unpopular&quot;, that intellect is neutral, meaning that you are neither loved nor despised for it. He also states that it is only the correlation that makes smart teens automatically seem nerdy, and that a nerd is someone that is not socially adept enough. Additionally, he says that the reason why many smart kids are unpopular is that they &quot;don&#x27;t have time for the activities required for popularity.&quot;

Stereotypical nerd appearance, often lampooned in caricatures, can include very large glasses, dental braces, buck teeth, severe acne and pants worn high at the waist. Following suit of popular use in emoticons, Unicode released in 2015 its &quot;Nerd Face&quot; character, featuring some of those stereotypes: 🤓 (code point U+1F913). In the media, many nerds are males, portrayed as being physically unfit, either overweight or skinny due to lack of physical exercise. It has been suggested by some, such as linguist Mary Bucholtz, that being a nerd may be a state of being &quot;hyperwhite&quot; and rejecting African-American culture and slang that &quot;cool&quot; white children use. However, after the &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; movie franchise (with multicultural nerds), and the introduction of the Steve Urkel character on the television series &quot;Family Matters&quot;, nerds have been seen in all races and colors as well as more recently being a frequent young East Asian or Indian male stereotype in North America. Portrayal of &quot;nerd girls&quot;, in films such as &quot;She&#x27;s Out of Control&quot;, &quot;Welcome to the Dollhouse&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot; depicts that smart but nerdy women might suffer later in life if they do not focus on improving their physical attractiveness.

In the United States, a 2010 study published in the &quot;Journal of International and Intercultural Communication&quot; indicated that Asian Americans are perceived as most likely to be nerds, followed by White Americans, while non-White Hispanics and African Americans were perceived as least likely to be nerds. These stereotypes stem from concepts of Orientalism and Primitivism, as discussed in Ron Eglash&#x27;s essay &quot;Race, Sex, and Nerds: From Black Geeks to Asian American Hipsters&quot;.

Some of the stereotypical behaviors associated with the &quot;nerd&quot; stereotype have correlations with the traits of Asperger syndrome or other autism spectrum conditions.

===Pride===
The rise of Silicon Valley and the American computer industry at large has allowed many so-called &quot;nerdy people&quot; to accumulate large fortunes and influence media culture. Many stereotypically nerdy interests, such as superhero, fantasy and science fiction works, are now international popular culture hits. Some measures of nerdiness are now allegedly considered desirable, as, to some, it suggests a person who is intelligent, respectful, interesting, and able to earn a large salary. Stereotypical nerd qualities are evolving, going from awkwardness and social ostracism to an allegedly more widespread acceptance and sometimes even celebration of their differences.

Johannes Grenzfurthner, researcher, self-proclaimed nerd and director of nerd documentary &quot;Traceroute&quot;, reflects on the emergence of nerds and nerd culture:
In the 1984 film &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot;, Robert Carradine worked to embody the nerd stereotype; in doing so, he helped create a definitive image of nerds. Additionally, the storyline presaged, and may have helped inspire, the &quot;nerd pride&quot; that emerged in the late 1990s. &quot;American Splendor&quot; regular Toby Radloff claims this was the movie that inspired him to become &quot;The Genuine Nerd from Cleveland, Ohio&quot;. In the &quot;American Splendor&quot; film, Toby&#x27;s friend, &quot;American Splendor&quot; author Harvey Pekar, was less receptive to the movie, believing it to be hopelessly idealistic, explaining that Toby, an adult low income file clerk, had nothing in common with the middle class kids in the film who would eventually attain college degrees, success, and cease being perceived as nerds. Many, however, seem to share Radloff&#x27;s view, as &quot;nerd pride&quot; has become more widespread in the years since. MIT professor Gerald Sussman, for example, seeks to instill pride in nerds:
=== Bullying ===
Individuals who are labeled as &quot;nerds&quot; are often the target of bullying due to a range of reasons that may include physical appearance or social background. Paul Graham has suggested that the reason nerds are frequently singled out for bullying is their indifference to popularity or social context, in the face of a youth culture that views popularity as paramount. However, research findings suggest that bullies are often as socially inept as their academically better-performing victims, and that popularity fails to confer protection from bullying. Other commentators have pointed out that pervasive harassment of intellectually-oriented youth began only in the mid-twentieth century.

==In popular culture==
*&quot;White &amp; Nerdy&quot; by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, a parody of the song &quot;Ridin&#x27;&quot; by Chamillionaire, prominently features and celebrates aspects of nerd culture.
*Slashdot uses the tagline &quot;News for nerds. Stuff that matters.&quot; The Charles J. Sykes quote &quot;Be nice to nerds. You may end up working for them.&quot; has been popularized on the Internet and incorrectly attributed to Bill Gates.
*In Spain, Nerd Pride Day has been observed on May 25 since 2006, the same day as Towel Day, another somewhat nerdy holiday.&lt;ref name=&quot;geek/nerd&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The date was picked as it is the anniversary of the release of &quot;Star Wars&quot;.
*Australian events such as Oz Comic-Con (a large comic book and cosplay convention, similar to San Diego Comic-Con) and Supernova, are incredibly popular events among the culture of people who identify themselves as nerds. In 2016, Oz Comic-Con in Perth saw almost 20,000 cosplayers and comic book fans meet to celebrate the event, hence being named a &quot;professionally organised Woodstock for geeks&quot;.
*Fans of the Vlogbrothers (a YouTube channel starring John and Hank Green) call themselves &quot;nerdfighters&quot; and refer to the fan base as a whole as &quot;Nerdfighteria&quot;.

<doc id="21496" wikidata="Q123619" url="?curid=21496" title="Nucleic acid">
<text>Nucleic acids are large biomolecules that are crucial in all cells and viruses. They are composed of nucleotides, which are the monomer components: a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group and a nitrogenous base. The two main classes of nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). If the sugar is ribose, the polymer is RNA; if the sugar is deoxyribose, a variant of ribose, the polymer is DNA.

Nucleic acids are chemical compounds that are found in nature. They carry information in cells and make up genetic material. These acids are very common in all living things, where they create, encode, and store information in every living cell of every life-form on Earth. In turn, they send and express that information inside and outside the cell nucleus. From the inner workings of the cell to the young of a living thing, they contain and provide information via the nucleic acid sequence. This gives the RNA and DNA their unmistakable &#x27;ladder-step&#x27; order of nucleotides within their molecules. Both play a crucial role in directing protein synthesis.

Strings of nucleotides are bonded to form spiraling backbones and assembled into chains of bases or base-pairs selected from the five primary, or canonical, nucleobases. RNA usually forms a chain of single bases, whereas DNA forms a chain of base pairs. The bases found in RNA and DNA are: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. Thymine occurs only in DNA and uracil only in RNA. Using amino acids and protein synthesis, the specific sequence in DNA of these nucleobase-pairs helps to keep and send coded instructions as genes. In RNA, base-pair sequencing helps to make new proteins that determine most chemical processes of all life forms.

== History ==

Nucleic acid was, partially, first discovered by Friedrich Miescher in 1869 at the University of Tübingen, Germany. He discovered a new substance, which he called nuclein and which - depending on how his results are interpreted in detail - can be seen in modern terms either as a nucleic acid-histone complex or as the actual nucleic acid. Phoebus Levene determined the basic structure of nucleic acids. In the early 1880s, Albrecht Kossel further purified the nucleid acid substance and discovered its highly acidic properties. He later also identified the nucleobases.
In 1889 Richard Altmann created the term nucleic acid – at that time DNA and RNA were not differentiated.
In 1938 Astbury and Bell published the first X-ray diffraction pattern of DNA.

In 1944 the Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment showed that DNA is the carrier of genetic information and in 1953 Watson and Crick proposed the double-helix structure of DNA.

Experimental studies of nucleic acids constitute a major part of modern biological and medical research, and form a foundation for genome and forensic science, and the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.

==Occurrence and nomenclature==
The term &quot;nucleic acid&quot; is the overall name for DNA and RNA, members of a family of biopolymers, and is a type of &quot;polynucleotide&quot;. Nucleic acids were named for their initial discovery within the nucleus, and for the presence of phosphate groups (related to phosphoric acid). Although first discovered within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, nucleic acids are now known to be found in all life forms including within bacteria, archaea, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and viruses (There is debate as to whether viruses are living or non-living). All living cells contain both DNA and RNA (except some cells such as mature red blood cells), while viruses contain either DNA or RNA, but usually not both.
The basic component of biological nucleic acids is the nucleotide, each of which contains a pentose sugar (ribose or deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nucleobase.
Nucleic acids are also generated within the laboratory, through the use of enzymes (DNA and RNA polymerases) and by solid-phase chemical synthesis.

==Molecular composition and size==
Nucleic acids are generally very large molecules. Indeed, DNA molecules are probably the largest individual molecules known. Well-studied biological nucleic acid molecules range in size from 21 nucleotides (small interfering RNA) to large chromosomes (human chromosome 1 is a single molecule that contains 247 million base pairs).

In most cases, naturally occurring DNA molecules are double-stranded and RNA molecules are single-stranded. There are numerous exceptions, however—some viruses have genomes made of double-stranded RNA and other viruses have single-stranded DNA genomes, and, in some circumstances, nucleic acid structures with three or four strands can form.

Nucleic acids are linear polymers (chains) of nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of three components: a purine or pyrimidine nucleobase (sometimes termed &quot;nitrogenous base&quot; or simply &quot;base&quot;), a pentose sugar, and a phosphate group which makes the molecule acidic. The substructure consisting of a nucleobase plus sugar is termed a nucleoside. Nucleic acid types differ in the structure of the sugar in their nucleotides–DNA contains 2&#x27;-deoxyribose while RNA contains ribose (where the only difference is the presence of a hydroxyl group). Also, the nucleobases found in the two nucleic acid types are different: adenine, cytosine, and guanine are found in both RNA and DNA, while thymine occurs in DNA and uracil occurs in RNA.

The sugars and phosphates in nucleic acids are connected to each other in an alternating chain (sugar-phosphate backbone) through phosphodiester linkages. In conventional nomenclature, the carbons to which the phosphate groups attach are the 3&#x27;-end and the 5&#x27;-end carbons of the sugar. This gives nucleic acids directionality, and the ends of nucleic acid molecules are referred to as 5&#x27;-end and 3&#x27;-end. The nucleobases are joined to the sugars via an &quot;N&quot;-glycosidic linkage involving a nucleobase ring nitrogen (&quot;N&quot;-1 for pyrimidines and &quot;N&quot;-9 for purines) and the 1&#x27; carbon of the pentose sugar ring.

Non-standard nucleosides are also found in both RNA and DNA and usually arise from modification of the standard nucleosides within the DNA molecule or the primary (initial) RNA transcript. Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules contain a particularly large number of modified nucleosides.

==Topology==
Double-stranded nucleic acids are made up of complementary sequences, in which extensive Watson-Crick base pairing results in a highly repeated and quite uniform nucleic acid double-helical three-dimensional structure. In contrast, single-stranded RNA and DNA molecules are not constrained to a regular double helix, and can adopt highly complex three-dimensional structures that are based on short stretches of intramolecular base-paired sequences including both Watson-Crick and noncanonical base pairs, and a wide range of complex tertiary interactions.

Nucleic acid molecules are usually unbranched and may occur as linear and circular molecules. For example, bacterial chromosomes, plasmids, mitochondrial DNA, and chloroplast DNA are usually circular double-stranded DNA molecules, while chromosomes of the eukaryotic nucleus are usually linear double-stranded DNA molecules. Most RNA molecules are linear, single-stranded molecules, but both circular and branched molecules can result from RNA splicing reactions. The total amount of pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule is equal to the total amount of purines. The diameter of the helix is about 20 Å.

==Sequences==

One DNA or RNA molecule differs from another primarily in the sequence of nucleotides. Nucleotide sequences are of great importance in biology since they carry the ultimate instructions that encode all biological molecules, molecular assemblies, subcellular and cellular structures, organs, and organisms, and directly enable cognition, memory, and behavior. Enormous efforts have gone into the development of experimental methods to determine the nucleotide sequence of biological DNA and RNA molecules, and today hundreds of millions of nucleotides are sequenced daily at genome centers and smaller laboratories worldwide. In addition to maintaining the GenBank nucleic acid sequence database, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) provides analysis and retrieval resources for the data in GenBank and other biological data made available through the NCBI web site.

==Types==

===Deoxyribonucleic acid===

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a nucleic acid containing the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms. The chemical DNA was discovered in 1869, but its role in genetic inheritance was not demonstrated until 1943. The DNA segments that carry this genetic information are called genes. Other DNA sequences have structural purposes, or are involved in regulating the use of this genetic information. Along with RNA and proteins, DNA is one of the three major macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life.
DNA consists of two long polymers of monomer units called nucleotides, with backbones made of sugars and phosphate groups joined by ester bonds. These two strands are oriented in opposite directions to each other and are, therefore, antiparallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of molecules called nucleobases (informally, bases). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes genetic information. This information specifies the sequence of the amino acids within proteins according to the genetic code. The code is read by copying stretches of DNA into the related nucleic acid RNA in a process called transcription.
Within cells, DNA is organized into long sequences called chromosomes. During cell division these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of DNA replication, providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes. Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi, and protists) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus and some of their DNA in organelles, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. In contrast, prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm. Within the chromosomes, chromatin proteins such as histones compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.

=== Ribonucleic acid ===

Ribonucleic acid (RNA) functions in converting genetic information from genes into the amino acid sequences of proteins. The three universal types of RNA include transfer RNA (tRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Messenger RNA acts to carry genetic sequence information between DNA and ribosomes, directing protein synthesis and carries instructions from DNA in the nucleus to ribosome . Ribosomal RNA reads the DNA sequence, and catalyzes peptide bond formation. Transfer RNA serves as the carrier molecule for amino acids to be used in protein synthesis, and is responsible for decoding the mRNA. In addition, many other classes of RNA are now known.

===Artificial nucleic acid===

Artificial nucleic acid analogues have been designed and synthesized. They include peptide nucleic acid, morpholino- and locked nucleic acid, glycol nucleic acid, and threose nucleic acid. Each of these is distinguished from naturally occurring DNA or RNA by changes to the backbone of the molecules.

<doc id="21497" wikidata="Q182168" url="?curid=21497" title="Nitrate">
<text>Nitrate is a polyatomic ion with the chemical formula . Salts containing this ion are called nitrates. Nitrates are common components of fertilizers and explosives. Almost all inorganic nitrates are soluble in water. An example of an insoluble nitrate is bismuth oxynitrate.

== Chemical structure ==
The nitrate anion is the conjugate base of nitric acid, consisting of one central nitrogen atom surrounded by three identically bonded oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement. The nitrate ion carries a formal charge of −1. This charge results from a combination formal charge in which each of the three oxygens carries a − charge, whereas the nitrogen carries a +1 charge, all these adding up to formal charge of the polyatomic nitrate ion. This arrangement is commonly used as an example of resonance. Like the isoelectronic carbonate ion, the nitrate ion can be represented by three resonance structures:

== Chemical and biochemical properties ==
In the anion, the oxidation state of the central nitrogen atom is V (+5). This corresponds to the highest possible oxidation number of nitrogen. Nitrate is a potentially powerful oxidizer as evidenced by its explosive behaviour at high temperature when it is detonated in ammonium nitrate (), or black powder, ignited by the shock wave of a primary explosive. However, in contrast to red fuming nitric acid (), or concentrated nitric acid (), nitrate dissolved in aqueous solution at neutral or high pH is only a weak oxidizing agent and is stable under sterile, or aseptic, conditions, in the absence of microorganisms. To increase its oxidation power, acidic conditions and high concentrations are needed, under which nitrate transforms into nitric acid. This behaviour is consistent with the general theory of reduction-oxidation (redox) in electrochemistry: oxidizing power is exacerbated under acidic conditions while the power of reducing agents is reinforced under basic conditions. This can be illustrated by means of a Pourbaix diagram (Eh–pH diagram) drawn using the Nernst equation and the corresponding redox reactions. During the reduction of oxidizers, the oxidation state decreases and oxide ions () in excess released in water by the reaction are more easily protonated under acid conditions () which drives the reduction reaction to the right according to Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle. For the oxidation of reducing agents, the reverse occurs: as the oxidation state increases, oxide anions are needed to neutralise the surplus of positive charges born by the central atom. As basic conditions favor the production of oxide anions (), this drives the chemical equilibrium of the oxidation reaction to the right. 

Meanwhile, nitrate is used as a powerful terminal electron acceptor by denitrifying bacteria to deliver the energy they need to thrive. Under anaerobic conditions, nitrate is the strongest electron acceptor used by prokaryote microorganisms (bacteria and archaea) to respirate. The redox couple / is at the top of the redox scale for the anaerobic respiration, just below the couple oxygen (/), but above the couples Mn(IV)/Mn(II), Fe(III)/Fe(II), /, /. In natural waters, inevitably contaminated by microorganisms, nitrate is a quite unstable and labile dissolved chemical species because it is metabolised by denitrifying bacteria. Water samples for nitrate/nitrite analyses need to be kept at 4 °C in a refrigerated room and analysed as quick as possible to limit the loss of nitrate.

In the first step of the denitrification process, dissolved nitrate () is catalytically reduced into nitrite () by the enzymatic activity of bacteria. In aqueous solution, dissolved nitrite, N(III), is a more powerful oxidizer that nitrate, N(V), because it has to accept less electrons and its reduction is less kinetically hindered than that of nitrate.

During the biological denitrification process, further nitrite reduction also gives rise to another powerful oxidizing agent: nitric oxide (NO). NO can fix on myoglobin accentuating its red coloration. NO is an important biological signaling molecule and intervenes in the vasodilation process, but it can also produce free radicals in biological tissues, accelerating their degradation and aging process. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by NO contribute to the oxidative stress, a condition involved in vascular dysfunction and atherogenesis.

== Detection in chemical analysis ==
The nitrate anion is commonly analysed in water by ion chromatography (IC) along with other anions also present in solution. The main advantage of IC is its ease and the simultaneous analysis of all the anions present in the aqueous sample. Other methods for the specific detection of nitrate rely on its conversion to nitrite followed by nitrite-specific tests. The reduction of nitrate to nitrite is effected by a copper-cadmium material. The sample is introduced in a flow injection analyzer, and the resulting nitrite-containing effluent is then combined with a reagent for colorimetric or electrochemical detection. The most popular of these assays is the Griess test, whereby nitrite is converted to a deeply colored azo dye suited for UV-vis spectroscopic analysis. The method exploits the reactivity of nitrous acid derived from acidification of nitrite. Nitrous acid selectively reacts with aromatic amines to give diazonium salts, which in turn couple with a second reagent to give the azo dye. The detection limit is 0.02 to 2 μM. Such methods have been highly adapted to biological samples.

== Occurrence and production ==
Nitrate salts are found naturally on earth in arid environments as large deposits, particularly of nitratine, a major source of sodium nitrate.

Nitrates are produced by a number of species of nitrifying bacteria in the natural environment using ammonia or urea as a source of nitrogen and source of free energy. Nitrate compounds for gunpowder were historically produced, in the absence of mineral nitrate sources, by means of various fermentation processes using urine and dung.

Lightning strikes in earth&#x27;s nitrogen- and oxygen-rich atmosphere produce a mixture of oxides of nitrogen, which form nitrous ions and nitrate ions, which are washed from the atmosphere by rain or in occult deposition.

Nitrates are produced industrially from nitric acid.

== Uses ==

=== Agriculture ===
Nitrate is a chemical compound that serves as a primary form of nitrogen for many plants. This essential nutrient is used by plants to synthesize proteins, nucleic acids, and other vital organic molecules. The transformation of atmospheric nitrogen into nitrate is facilitated by certain bacteria and lightning in the nitrogen cycle, which exemplifies nature&#x27;s ability to convert a relatively inert molecule into a form that is crucial for biological productivity.

Nitrates are used as fertilizers in agriculture because of their high solubility and biodegradability. The main nitrate fertilizers are ammonium, sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium salts. Several billion kilograms are produced annually for this purpose. The significance of nitrate extends beyond its role as a nutrient since it acts as a signaling molecule in plants, regulating processes such as root growth, flowering, and leaf development.

While nitrate is beneficial for agriculture since it enhances soil fertility and crop yields, its excessive use can lead to nutrient runoff, water pollution, and the proliferation of aquatic dead zones. Therefore, sustainable agricultural practices that balance productivity with environmental stewardship are necessary. Nitrate&#x27;s importance in ecosystems is evident since it supports the growth and development of plants, contributing to biodiversity and ecological balance.

=== Firearms ===
Nitrates are used as oxidizing agents, most notably in explosives, where the rapid oxidation of carbon compounds liberates large volumes of gases (see gunpowder as an example).

=== Industrial === 
Sodium nitrate is used to remove air bubbles from molten glass and some ceramics. Mixtures of molten salts are used to harden the surface of some metals.

=== Photographic film ===
Nitrate was also used as a film stock through nitrocellulose. Due to its high combustibility, the film making studios swapped to cellulose acetate safety film in 1950.

=== Medicinal and pharmaceutical use ===
In the medical field, nitrate-derived organic esters, such as glyceryl trinitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, and isosorbide mononitrate, are used in the prophylaxis and management of acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, acute pulmonary oedema. This class of drug, to which amyl nitrite also belongs, is known as nitrovasodilators.

== Toxicity and safety ==
The two areas of concerns about the toxicity of nitrate are the following: 
* nitrate reduced by the microbial activity of nitrate reducing bacteria is the precursor of nitrite in water and in the lower gastrointestinal tract. Nitrite is a precursor to carcinogenic nitrosamines, and;
* via the formation of nitrite, nitrate is implicated in methemoglobinemia, a disorder of hemoglobin in red blood cells susceptible to especially affect infants and toddlers.

=== Methemoglobinemia ===

One of the most common cause of methemoglobinemia in infants is due to the ingestion of nitrates and nitrites through well water or foods. 

In fact, nitrates (), often present at too high concentration in drinkwater, are only the precursor chemical species of nitrites (), the real culprits of methemoglobinemia. Nitrites produced by the microbial reduction of nitrate (directly in the drinkwater, or after ingestion by the infant, in his digestive system) are more powerful oxidizers than nitrates and are the chemical agent really responsible for the oxidation of Fe2+ into Fe3+ in the tetrapyrrole heme of hemoglobin. Indeed, nitrate anions are too weak oxidizers in aqueous solution to be able to directly, or at least sufficiently rapidly, oxidize Fe2+ into Fe3+, because of kinetics limitations.

Infants younger than 4 months are at greater risk given that they drink more water per body weight, they have a lower NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase activity, and they have a higher level of fetal hemoglobin which converts more easily to methemoglobin. Additionally, infants are at an increased risk after an episode of gastroenteritis due to the production of nitrites by bacteria. 

However, other causes than nitrates can also affect infants and pregnant women. Indeed, the blue baby syndrome can also be caused by a number of other factors such as the cyanotic heart disease, a congenital heart defect resulting in low levels of oxygen in the blood, or by gastric upset, such as diarrheal infection, protein intolerance, heavy metal toxicity, etc.

=== Drinking water standards ===
Through the Safe Drinking Water Act, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has set a maximum contaminant level of 10 mg/L or 10 ppm of nitrate in drinking water.

An acceptable daily intake (ADI) for nitrate ions was established in the range of 0–3.7 mg (kg body weight)−1 day−1 by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JEFCA).

=== Aquatic toxicity ===

In freshwater or estuarine systems close to land, nitrate can reach concentrations that are lethal to fish. While nitrate is much less toxic than ammonia, levels over 30 ppm of nitrate can inhibit growth, impair the immune system and cause stress in some aquatic species. Nitrate toxicity remains a subject of debate.

In most cases of excess nitrate concentrations in aquatic systems, the primary sources are wastewater discharges, as well as surface runoff from agricultural or landscaped areas that have received excess nitrate fertilizer. The resulting eutrophication and algae blooms result in anoxia and dead zones. As a consequence, as nitrate forms a component of total dissolved solids, they are widely used as an indicator of water quality.

== Human impacts on ecosystems through nitrate deposition ==

Nitrate deposition into ecosystems has markedly increased due to anthropogenic activities, notably from the widespread application of nitrogen-rich fertilizers in agriculture and the emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Annually, about 195 million metric tons of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers are used worldwide, with nitrates constituting a significant portion of this amount. In regions with intensive agriculture, such as parts of the U.S., China, and India, the use of nitrogen fertilizers can exceed 200 kilograms per hectare.

The impact of increased nitrate deposition extends beyond plant communities to affect soil microbial populations. The change in soil chemistry and nutrient dynamics can disrupt the natural processes of nitrogen fixation, nitrification, and denitrification, leading to altered microbial community structures and functions. This disruption can further impact the nutrient cycling and overall ecosystem health.

== Dietary nitrate ==
A source of nitrate in the human diets arises from the consumption of leafy green foods, such as spinach and arugula. can be present in beetroot juice. Drinking water represents also a primary nitrate intake source.

Nitrate ingestion rapidly increases the plasma nitrate concentration by a factor of 2 to 3, and this elevated nitrate concentration can be maintained for more than 2 weeks. Increased plasma nitrate enhances the production of nitric oxide, NO. Nitric oxide is a physiological signaling molecule which intervenes in, among other things, regulation of muscle blood flow and mitochondrial respiration.

=== Cured meats ===
&quot;Nitrite&quot; () consumption is primarily determined by the amount of processed meats eaten, and the concentration of nitrates () added to these meats (bacon, sausages…) for their curing. Although nitrites are the nitrogen species chiefly used in meat curing, nitrates are used as well and can be transformed into nitrite by microorganisms, or in the digestion process, starting by their dissolution in saliva and their contact with the microbiota of the mouth. Nitrites lead to the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines. The production of nitrosamines may be inhibited by the use of the antioxidants vitamin C and the alpha-tocopherol form of vitamin E during curing.

Many meat processors claim their meats (e.g. bacon) is &quot;uncured&quot; – which is a marketing claim with no factual basis: there is no such thing as &quot;uncured&quot; bacon (as that would be, essentially, raw sliced pork belly). &quot;Uncured&quot; meat is in fact actually cured with nitrites with virtually &quot;no&quot; distinction in process – the only difference being the USDA labeling requirement between nitrite of vegetable origin (such as from celery) vs. &quot;synthetic&quot; sodium nitrite. An analogy would be purified &quot;sea salt&quot; vs. sodium chloride – both being exactly the same chemical with the only essential difference being the origin.

Anti-hypertensive diets, such as the DASH diet, typically contain high levels of nitrates, which are first reduced to nitrite in the saliva, as detected in saliva testing, prior to forming nitric oxide (NO).

== Domestic animal feed ==
Symptoms of nitrate poisoning in domestic animals include increased heart rate and respiration; in advanced cases blood and tissue may turn a blue or brown color. Feed can be tested for nitrate; treatment consists of supplementing or substituting existing supplies with lower nitrate material. Safe levels of nitrate for various types of livestock are as follows:

The values above are on a dry (moisture-free) basis.
