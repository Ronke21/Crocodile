<text>Sir Michael Francis Atiyah (; 22 April 1929 – 11 January 2019) was a British-Lebanese mathematician specialising in geometry. His contributions include the Atiyah–Singer index theorem and co-founding topological K-theory. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966 and the Abel Prize in 2004.

==Early life and education==

Atiyah was born on 22 April 1929 in Hampstead, London, England, the son of Jean (née Levens) and Edward Atiyah. His mother was Scottish and his father was a Lebanese Orthodox Christian. He had two brothers, Patrick (deceased) and Joe, and a sister, Selma (deceased). Atiyah went to primary school at the Diocesan school in Khartoum, Sudan (1934–1941), and to secondary school at Victoria College in Cairo and Alexandria (1941–1945); the school was also attended by European nobility displaced by the Second World War and some future leaders of Arab nations. He returned to England and Manchester Grammar School for his HSC studies (1945–1947) and did his national service with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (1947–1949). His undergraduate and postgraduate studies took place at Trinity College, Cambridge (1949–1955). He was a doctoral student of William V. D. Hodge and was awarded a doctorate in 1955 for a thesis entitled &quot;Some Applications of Topological Methods in Algebraic Geometry&quot;.

Atiyah was a member of the British Humanist Association.

During his time at Cambridge, he was president of The Archimedeans.

==Career and research==

Atiyah spent the academic year 1955–1956 at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, then returned to Cambridge University, where he was a research fellow and assistant lecturer (1957–1958), then a university lecturer and tutorial fellow at Pembroke College, Cambridge (1958–1961). In 1961, he moved to the University of Oxford, where he was a reader and professorial fellow at St Catherine&#x27;s College (1961–1963). He became Savilian Professor of Geometry and a professorial fellow of New College, Oxford, from 1963 to 1969. He took up a three-year professorship at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton after which he returned to Oxford as a Royal Society Research Professor and professorial fellow of St Catherine&#x27;s College. He was president of the London Mathematical Society from 1974 to 1976.
Atiyah was president of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs from 1997 to 2002. He also contributed to the foundation of the InterAcademy Panel on International Issues, the Association of European Academies (ALLEA), and the European Mathematical Society (EMS).

Within the United Kingdom, he was involved in the creation of the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Cambridge and was its first director (1990–1996). He was President of the Royal Society (1990–1995), Master of Trinity College, Cambridge (1990–1997), Chancellor of the University of Leicester (1995–2005), and president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (2005–2008). From 1997 until his death in 2019 he was an honorary professor in the University of Edinburgh. He was a Trustee of the James Clerk Maxwell Foundation.

Atiyah&#x27;s mathematical collaborators included Raoul Bott, Friedrich Hirzebruch and Isadore Singer, and his students included Graeme Segal, Nigel Hitchin, Simon Donaldson, and Edward Witten. Together with Hirzebruch, he laid the foundations for topological K-theory, an important tool in algebraic topology, which, informally speaking, describes ways in which spaces can be twisted. His best known result, the Atiyah–Singer index theorem, was proved with Singer in 1963 and is used in counting the number of independent solutions to differential equations. Some of his more recent work was inspired by theoretical physics, in particular instantons and monopoles, which are responsible for some corrections in quantum field theory. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966 and the Abel Prize in 2004.

===Collaborations===

Atiyah collaborated with many mathematicians. His three main collaborations were with Raoul Bott on the Atiyah–Bott fixed-point theorem and many other topics, with Isadore M. Singer on the Atiyah–Singer index theorem, and with Friedrich Hirzebruch on topological K-theory, all of whom he met at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in 1955. His other collaborators included; J. Frank Adams (Hopf invariant problem), Jürgen Berndt (projective planes), Roger Bielawski (Berry–Robbins problem), Howard Donnelly (L-functions), Vladimir G. Drinfeld (instantons), Johan L. Dupont (singularities of vector fields), Lars Gårding (hyperbolic differential equations), Nigel J. Hitchin (monopoles), William V. D. Hodge (Integrals of the second kind), Michael Hopkins (K-theory), Lisa Jeffrey (topological Lagrangians), John D. S. Jones (Yang–Mills theory), Juan Maldacena (M-theory), Yuri I. Manin (instantons), Nick S. Manton (Skyrmions), Vijay K. Patodi (spectral asymmetry), A. N. Pressley (convexity), Elmer Rees (vector bundles), Wilfried Schmid (discrete series representations), Graeme Segal (equivariant K-theory), Alexander Shapiro (Clifford algebras), L.

Ward (instantons) and Edward Witten (M-theory, topological quantum field theories).

His later research on gauge field theories, particularly Yang–Mills theory, stimulated important interactions between geometry and physics, most notably in the work of Edward Witten.

Other contemporary mathematicians who influenced Atiyah include Roger Penrose, Lars Hörmander, Alain Connes and Jean-Michel Bismut. Atiyah said that the mathematician he most admired was Hermann Weyl, and that his favourite mathematicians from before the 20th century were Bernhard Riemann and William Rowan Hamilton.

The seven volumes of Atiyah&#x27;s collected papers include most of his work, except for his commutative algebra textbook; the first five volumes are divided thematically and the sixth and seventh arranged by date.

===Algebraic geometry (1952–1958)===
Atiyah&#x27;s early papers on algebraic geometry (and some general papers) are reprinted in the first volume of his collected works.

As an undergraduate Atiyah was interested in classical projective geometry, and wrote his first paper: a short note on twisted cubics. He started research under W. V. D. Hodge and won the Smith&#x27;s prize for 1954 for a sheaf-theoretic approach to ruled surfaces, which encouraged Atiyah to continue in mathematics, rather than switch to his other interests—architecture and archaeology.
His PhD thesis with Hodge was on a sheaf-theoretic approach to Solomon Lefschetz&#x27;s theory of integrals of the second kind on algebraic varieties, and resulted in an invitation to visit the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton for a year. While in Princeton he classified vector bundles on an elliptic curve (extending Alexander Grothendieck&#x27;s classification of vector bundles on a genus 0 curve), by showing that any vector bundle is a sum of (essentially unique) indecomposable vector bundles, and then showing that the space of indecomposable vector bundles of given degree and positive dimension can be identified with the elliptic curve. He also studied double points on surfaces, giving the first example of a flop, a special birational transformation of 3-folds that was later heavily used in Shigefumi Mori&#x27;s work on minimal models for 3-folds. Atiyah&#x27;s flop can also be used to show that the universal marked family of K3 surfaces is not Hausdorff.

===K-theory (1959–1974)===
Atiyah&#x27;s works on K-theory, including his book on K-theory are reprinted in volume 2 of his collected works.

The simplest nontrivial example of a vector bundle is the Möbius band (pictured on the right): a strip of paper with a twist in it, which represents a rank 1 vector bundle over a circle (the circle in question being the centerline of the Möbius band). K-theory is a tool for working with higher-dimensional analogues of this example, or in other words for describing higher-dimensional twistings: elements of the K-group of a space are represented by vector bundles over it, so the Möbius band represents an element of the K-group of a circle.

Topological K-theory was discovered by Atiyah and Friedrich Hirzebruch who were inspired by Grothendieck&#x27;s proof of the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem and Bott&#x27;s work on the periodicity theorem. This paper only discussed the zeroth K-group; they shortly after extended it to K-groups of all degrees, giving the first (nontrivial) example of a generalized cohomology theory.

Several results showed that the newly introduced K-theory was in some ways more powerful than ordinary cohomology theory. Atiyah and Todd used K-theory to improve the lower bounds found using ordinary cohomology by Borel and Serre for the James number, describing when a map from a complex Stiefel manifold to a sphere has a cross section. (Adams and Grant-Walker later showed that the bound found by Atiyah and Todd was best possible.) Atiyah and Hirzebruch used K-theory to explain some relations between Steenrod operations and Todd classes that Hirzebruch had noticed a few years before. The original solution of the Hopf invariant one problem operations by J. F. Adams was very long and complicated, using secondary cohomology operations. Atiyah showed how primary operations in K-theory could be used to give a short solution taking only a few lines, and in joint work with Adams also proved analogues of the result at odd primes.
The Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence relates the ordinary cohomology of a space to its generalized cohomology theory. (Atiyah and Hirzebruch used the case of K-theory, but their method works for all cohomology theories).

Atiyah showed that for a finite group &quot;G&quot;, the K theory of its classifying space, &quot;BG&quot;, is isomorphic to the completion of its character ring:
:formula_1
The same year they proved the result for &quot;G&quot; any compact connected Lie group. Although soon the result could be extended to &quot;all&quot; compact Lie groups by incorporating results from Graeme Segal&#x27;s thesis, that extension was complicated. However a simpler and more general proof was produced by introducing equivariant K-theory, &quot;i.e.&quot; equivalence classes of &quot;G&quot;-vector bundles over a compact &quot;G&quot;-space &quot;X&quot;. It was shown that under suitable conditions the completion of the equivariant K theory of &quot;X&quot; is isomorphic to the ordinary K-theory of a space, formula_2, which fibred over &quot;BG&quot; with fibre &quot;X&quot;:
:formula_3

The original result then followed as a corollary by taking &quot;X&quot; to be a point: the left hand side reduced to the completion of &quot;R(G)&quot; and the right to &quot;K(BG)&quot;. See Atiyah–Segal completion theorem for more details.

He defined new generalized homology and cohomology theories called bordism and cobordism, and pointed out that many of the deep results on cobordism of manifolds found by René Thom, C. T. C. Wall, and others could be naturally reinterpreted as statements about these cohomology theories. Some of these cohomology theories, in particular complex cobordism, turned out to be some of the most powerful cohomology theories known.
He introduced the J-group &quot;J&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) of a finite complex &quot;X&quot;, defined as the group of stable fiber homotopy equivalence classes of sphere bundles; this was later studied in detail by J. F. Adams in a series of papers, leading to the Adams conjecture.

With Hirzebruch he extended the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem to complex analytic embeddings, and in a related paper they showed that the Hodge conjecture for integral cohomology is false. The Hodge conjecture for rational cohomology is, as of 2008, a major unsolved problem.

The Bott periodicity theorem was a central theme in Atiyah&#x27;s work on K-theory, and he repeatedly returned to it, reworking the proof several times to understand it better. With Bott he worked out an elementary proof, and gave another version of it in his book. With Bott and Shapiro he analysed the relation of Bott periodicity to the periodicity of Clifford algebras; although this paper did not have a proof of the periodicity theorem, a proof along similar lines was shortly afterwards found by R. Wood. He found a proof of several generalizations using elliptic operators; this new proof used an idea that he used to give a particularly short and easy proof of Bott&#x27;s original periodicity theorem.

===Index theory (1963–1984)===
Atiyah&#x27;s work on index theory is reprinted in volumes 3 and 4 of his collected works.

The index of a differential operator is closely related to the number of independent solutions (more precisely, it is the differences of the numbers of independent solutions of the differential operator and its adjoint). There are many hard and fundamental problems in mathematics that can easily be reduced to the problem of finding the number of independent solutions of some differential operator, so if one has some means of finding the index of a differential operator these problems can often be solved. This is what the Atiyah–Singer index theorem does: it gives a formula for the index of certain differential operators, in terms of topological invariants that look quite complicated but are in practice usually straightforward to calculate.

Several deep theorems, such as the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem, are special cases of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem. In fact the index theorem gave a more powerful result, because its proof applied to all compact complex manifolds, while Hirzebruch&#x27;s proof only worked for projective manifolds. There were also many new applications: a typical one is calculating the dimensions of the moduli spaces of instantons. The index theorem can also be run &quot;in reverse&quot;: the index is obviously an integer, so the formula for it must also give an integer, which sometimes gives subtle integrality conditions on invariants of manifolds. A typical example of this is Rochlin&#x27;s theorem, which follows from the index theorem.
The index problem for elliptic differential operators was posed in 1959 by Gel&#x27;fand. He noticed the homotopy invariance of the index, and asked for a formula for it by means of topological invariants. Some of the motivating examples included the Riemann–Roch theorem and its generalization the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem, and the Hirzebruch signature theorem. Hirzebruch and Borel had proved the integrality of the Â genus of a spin manifold, and Atiyah suggested that this integrality could be explained if it were the index of the Dirac operator (which was rediscovered by Atiyah and Singer in 1961).

The first announcement of the Atiyah–Singer theorem was their 1963 paper. The proof sketched in this announcement was inspired by Hirzebruch&#x27;s proof of the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem and was never published by them, though it is described in the book by Palais. Their first published proof was more similar to Grothendieck&#x27;s proof of the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem, replacing the cobordism theory of the first proof with K-theory, and they used this approach to give proofs of various generalizations in a sequence of papers from 1968 to 1971.

Instead of just one elliptic operator, one can consider a family of elliptic operators parameterized by some space &quot;Y&quot;. In this case the index is an element of the K theory of &quot;Y&quot;, rather than an integer. If the operators in the family are real, then the index lies in the real K theory of &quot;Y&quot;. This gives a little extra information, as the map from the real K theory of &quot;Y&quot; to the complex K-theory is not always injective.
With Bott, Atiyah found an analogue of the Lefschetz fixed-point formula for elliptic operators, giving the Lefschetz number of an endomorphism of an elliptic complex in terms of a sum over the fixed points of the endomorphism. As special cases their formula included the Weyl character formula, and several new results about elliptic curves with complex multiplication, some of which were initially disbelieved by experts.
Atiyah and Segal combined this fixed point theorem with the index theorem as follows.
If there is a compact group action of a group &quot;G&quot; on the compact manifold &quot;X&quot;, commuting with the elliptic operator, then one can replace ordinary K-theory in the index theorem with equivariant K-theory.
For trivial groups &quot;G&quot; this gives the index theorem, and for a finite group &quot;G&quot; acting with isolated fixed points it gives the Atiyah–Bott fixed point theorem. In general it gives the index as a sum over fixed point submanifolds of the group &quot;G&quot;.

Atiyah solved a problem asked independently by Hörmander and Gel&#x27;fand, about whether complex powers of analytic functions define distributions. Atiyah used Hironaka&#x27;s resolution of singularities to answer this affirmatively. An ingenious and elementary solution was found at about the same time by J. Bernstein, and discussed by Atiyah.

As an application of the equivariant index theorem, Atiyah and Hirzebruch showed that manifolds with effective circle actions have vanishing Â-genus. (Lichnerowicz showed that if a manifold has a metric of positive scalar curvature then the Â-genus vanishes.)

With Elmer Rees, Atiyah studied the problem of the relation between topological and holomorphic vector bundles on projective space. They solved the simplest unknown case, by showing that all rank 2 vector bundles over projective 3-space have a holomorphic structure. Horrocks had previously found some non-trivial examples of such vector bundles, which were later used by Atiyah in his study of instantons on the 4-sphere.
Atiyah, Bott and Vijay K. Patodi gave a new proof of the index theorem using the heat equation.

If the manifold is allowed to have boundary, then some restrictions must be put on the domain of the elliptic operator in order to ensure a finite index. These conditions can be local (like demanding that the sections in the domain vanish at the boundary) or more complicated global conditions (like requiring that the sections in the domain solve some differential equation). The local case was worked out by Atiyah and Bott, but they showed that many interesting operators (e.g., the signature operator) do not admit local boundary conditions. To handle these operators, Atiyah, Patodi and Singer introduced global boundary conditions equivalent to attaching a cylinder to the manifold along the boundary and then restricting the domain to those sections that are square integrable along the cylinder, and also introduced the Atiyah–Patodi–Singer eta invariant. This resulted in a series of papers on spectral asymmetry, which were later unexpectedly used in theoretical physics, in particular in Witten&#x27;s work on anomalies.
The fundamental solutions of linear hyperbolic partial differential equations often have Petrovsky lacunas: regions where they vanish identically. These were studied in 1945 by I. G. Petrovsky, who found topological conditions describing which regions were lacunas.
In collaboration with Bott and Lars Gårding, Atiyah wrote three papers updating and generalizing Petrovsky&#x27;s work.

Atiyah showed how to extend the index theorem to some non-compact manifolds, acted on by a discrete group with compact quotient. The kernel of the elliptic operator is in general infinite-dimensional in this case, but it is possible to get a finite index using the dimension of a module over a von Neumann algebra; this index is in general real rather than integer valued. This version is called the &quot;L2 index theorem,&quot; and was used by Atiyah and Schmid to give a geometric construction, using square integrable harmonic spinors, of Harish-Chandra&#x27;s discrete series representations of semisimple Lie groups. In the course of this work they found a more elementary proof of Harish-Chandra&#x27;s fundamental theorem on the local integrability of characters of Lie groups.

With H. Donnelly and I. Singer, he extended Hirzebruch&#x27;s formula (relating the signature defect at cusps of Hilbert modular surfaces to values of L-functions) from real quadratic fields to all totally real fields.

===Gauge theory (1977–1985)===
Many of his papers on gauge theory and related topics are reprinted in volume 5 of his collected works. A common theme of these papers is the study of moduli spaces of solutions to certain non-linear partial differential equations, in particular the equations for instantons and monopoles. This often involves finding a subtle correspondence between solutions of two seemingly quite different equations. An early example of this which Atiyah used repeatedly is the Penrose transform, which can sometimes convert solutions of a non-linear equation over some real manifold into solutions of some linear holomorphic equations over a different complex manifold.

In a series of papers with several authors, Atiyah classified all instantons on 4-dimensional Euclidean space. It is more convenient to classify instantons on a sphere as this is compact, and this is essentially equivalent to classifying instantons on Euclidean space as this is conformally equivalent to a sphere and the equations for instantons are conformally invariant. With Hitchin and Singer he calculated the dimension of the moduli space of irreducible self-dual connections (instantons) for any principal bundle over a compact 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold (the Atiyah–Hitchin–Singer theorem). For example, the dimension of the space of SU2 instantons of rank &quot;k&quot;&gt;0 is 8&quot;k&quot;−3. To do this they used the Atiyah–Singer index theorem to calculate the dimension of the tangent space of the moduli space at a point; the tangent space is essentially the space of solutions of an elliptic differential operator, given by the linearization of the non-linear Yang–Mills equations. These moduli spaces were later used by Donaldson to construct his invariants of 4-manifolds.
Atiyah and Ward used the Penrose correspondence to reduce the classification of all instantons on the 4-sphere to a problem in algebraic geometry. With Hitchin he used ideas of Horrocks to solve this problem, giving the ADHM construction of all instantons on a sphere; Manin and Drinfeld found the same construction at the same time, leading to a joint paper by all four authors. Atiyah reformulated this construction using quaternions and wrote up a leisurely account of this classification of instantons on Euclidean space as a book.
Atiyah&#x27;s work on instanton moduli spaces was used in Donaldson&#x27;s work on Donaldson theory. Donaldson showed that the moduli space of (degree 1) instantons over a compact simply connected 4-manifold with positive definite intersection form can be compactified to give a cobordism between the manifold and a sum of copies of complex projective space. He deduced from this that the intersection form must be a sum of one-dimensional ones, which led to several spectacular applications to smooth 4-manifolds, such as the existence of non-equivalent smooth structures on 4-dimensional Euclidean space. Donaldson went on to use the other moduli spaces studied by Atiyah to define Donaldson invariants, which revolutionized the study of smooth 4-manifolds, and showed that they were more subtle than smooth manifolds in any other dimension, and also quite different from topological 4-manifolds. Atiyah described some of these results in a survey talk.

Green&#x27;s functions for linear partial differential equations can often be found by using the Fourier transform to convert this into an algebraic problem. Atiyah used a non-linear version of this idea. He used the Penrose transform to convert the Green&#x27;s function for the conformally invariant Laplacian into a complex analytic object, which turned out to be essentially the diagonal embedding of the Penrose twistor space into its square. This allowed him to find an explicit formula for the conformally invariant Green&#x27;s function on a 4-manifold.

In his paper with Jones, he studied the topology of the moduli space of SU(2) instantons over a 4-sphere. They showed that the natural map from this moduli space to the space of all connections induces epimorphisms of homology groups in a certain range of dimensions, and suggested that it might induce isomorphisms of homology groups in the same range of dimensions. This became known as the Atiyah–Jones conjecture, and was later proved by several mathematicians.

Harder and M. S. Narasimhan described the cohomology of the moduli spaces of stable vector bundles over Riemann surfaces by counting the number of points of the moduli spaces over finite fields, and then using the Weil conjectures to recover the cohomology over the complex numbers.
Atiyah and R. Bott used Morse theory and the Yang–Mills equations over a Riemann surface to reproduce and extending the results of Harder and Narasimhan.

An old result due to Schur and Horn states that the set of possible diagonal vectors of an Hermitian matrix with given eigenvalues is the convex hull of all the permutations of the eigenvalues. Atiyah proved a generalization of this that applies to all compact symplectic manifolds acted on by a torus, showing that the image of the manifold under the moment map is a convex polyhedron, and with Pressley gave a related generalization to infinite-dimensional loop groups.

Duistermaat and Heckman found a striking formula, saying that the push-forward of the Liouville measure of a moment map for a torus action is given exactly by the stationary phase approximation (which is in general just an asymptotic expansion rather than exact). Atiyah and Bott showed that this could be deduced from a more general formula in equivariant cohomology, which was a consequence of well-known localization theorems. Atiyah showed that the moment map was closely related to geometric invariant theory, and this idea was later developed much further by his student F. Kirwan. Witten shortly after applied the Duistermaat–Heckman formula to loop spaces and showed that this formally gave the Atiyah–Singer index theorem for the Dirac operator; this idea was lectured on by Atiyah.

With Hitchin he worked on magnetic monopoles, and studied their scattering using an idea of Nick Manton. His book with Hitchin gives a detailed description of their work on magnetic monopoles. The main theme of the book is a study of a moduli space of magnetic monopoles; this has a natural Riemannian metric, and a key point is that this metric is complete and hyperkähler. The metric is then used to study the scattering of two monopoles, using a suggestion of N. Manton that the geodesic flow on the moduli space is the low energy approximation to the scattering. For example, they show that a head-on collision between two monopoles results in 90-degree scattering, with the direction of scattering depending on the relative phases of the two monopoles. He also studied monopoles on hyperbolic space.

Atiyah showed that instantons in 4 dimensions can be identified with instantons in 2 dimensions, which are much easier to handle. There is of course a catch: in going from 4 to 2 dimensions the structure group of the gauge theory changes from a finite-dimensional group to an infinite-dimensional loop group. This gives another example where the moduli spaces of solutions of two apparently unrelated nonlinear partial differential equations turn out to be essentially the same.

Atiyah and Singer found that anomalies in quantum field theory could be interpreted in terms of index theory of the Dirac operator; this idea later became widely used by physicists.

===Later work (1986–2019)===

Many of the papers in the 6th volume of his collected works are surveys, obituaries, and general talks. Atiyah continued to publish subsequently, including several surveys, a popular book, and another paper with Segal on twisted K-theory.

One paper is a detailed study of the Dedekind eta function from the point of view of topology and the index theorem.

Several of his papers from around this time study the connections between quantum field theory, knots, and Donaldson theory. He introduced the concept of a topological quantum field theory, inspired by Witten&#x27;s work and Segal&#x27;s definition of a conformal field theory. His book &quot;The Geometry and Physics of Knots&quot; describes the new knot invariants found by Vaughan Jones and Edward Witten in terms of topological quantum field theories, and his paper with L. Jeffrey explains Witten&#x27;s Lagrangian giving the Donaldson invariants.

He studied skyrmions with Nick Manton, finding a relation with magnetic monopoles and instantons, and giving a conjecture for the structure of the moduli space of two skyrmions as a certain subquotient of complex projective 3-space.

Several papers were inspired by a question of Jonathan Robbins (called the Berry–Robbins problem), who asked if there is a map from the configuration space of &quot;n&quot; points in 3-space to the flag manifold of the unitary group. Atiyah gave an affirmative answer to this question, but felt his solution was too computational and studied a conjecture that would give a more natural solution. He also related the question to Nahm&#x27;s equation, and introduced the Atiyah conjecture on configurations.
With Juan Maldacena and Cumrun Vafa, and E. Witten he described the dynamics of M-theory on manifolds with G2 holonomy. These papers seem to be the first time that Atiyah worked on exceptional Lie groups.

In his papers with M. Hopkins and G. Segal he returned to his earlier interest of K-theory, describing some twisted forms of K-theory with applications in theoretical physics.

In October 2016, he claimed a short proof of the non-existence of complex structures on the 6-sphere. His proof, like many predecessors, is considered flawed by the mathematical community, even after the proof was rewritten in a revised form.

At the 2018 Heidelberg Laureate Forum, he claimed to have solved the Riemann hypothesis, Hilbert&#x27;s eighth problem, by contradiction using the fine-structure constant. Again, the proof did not hold up and the hypothesis remains one of the six unsolved Millennium Prize Problems in mathematics, as of 2025.

He has been described as a &quot;towering figure&quot; in the recent history of Judaism for his influential work in adapting it to modern society, contending that Judaism should be a unifying and creative force by stressing the cultural and historical character of the religion as well as theological doctrine.

==Life and work==
Mordecai Menahem Kaplan was born Mottel Kaplan in Sventiany in the Russian Empire (present-day Švenčionys in Lithuania) on June 11, 1881, the son of Haya (née Anna) and Rabbi Israel Kaplan. His father, ordained by the leading Lithuanian Jewish luminaries, went to serve as a dayan in the court of Chief Rabbi Jacob Joseph in New York City in 1888. Mordecai was brought over to New York in 1889, at the age of nine.

Although affiliated with the most traditional Orthodox institutions and personalities in the Lower East Side, his father persisted in non-conformist openness to trends he had already exhibited in Russia: He hosted discussions in his home with maverick Bible critic Arnold Ehrlich, withdrew his son from the Etz Chaim Yeshiva, enrolled him in public school, and later sent him to JTS to pursue studies to become a modern Orthodox rabbi. Although not the norm amongst first-generation immigrants, who tended to be very conservative and traditional, his father was not alone in this kind of religious broad-mindedness. Kaplan&#x27;s early education was strictly Orthodox, but, by the time he reached secondary school, he had been attracted to heterodox opinions (particularly regarding the critical approach to the Bible). To counter this, his father hired a tutor to study Maimonides&#x27;s &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot; with Mordecai.

In 1893, Kaplan began studying for ordination at the Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS), which, at that time, was a Modern Orthodox institution founded to strengthen Orthodoxy and combat the hegemony of the Reform movement. In 1895, he also began studies at the City College of New York (CCNY), which he attended in the morning, while going to JTS in the evening. After graduating from CCNY in 1900, he went to Columbia University to study philosophy, sociology, and education, and received a master&#x27;s degree and doctorate. Majoring in philosophy, he wrote his master&#x27;s thesis on the ethical philosophy of Henry Sidgwick. His lecturers included the philosopher of ethical culture Felix Adler and the sociologist Franklin Giddings.

In 1902, he was ordained at the JTS. Although Kaplan&#x27;s conception of the nature of Judaism diverged from that of the seminary, he maintained a long association with the institution, teaching there for over fifty years; including becoming principal of its teachers’ institute in 1909, dean in 1931, and retiring in 1963. In 1903 he was appointed as administrator of the religious school at Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun (KJ), a gradually modernizing Orthodox synagogue in New York&#x27;s Yorkville district consisting of newly affluent and acculturating East European Jews who had migrated north from the Lower East Side. By April 1904, he was appointed as rabbi of the congregation.

Based on his diary, by around this time (1904, age 23), Kaplan already had serious misgivings about Orthodoxy&#x27;s ability to satisfy his spiritual needs and its unwillingness to modernize. By 1905, he noted doubt in the divine origin of the Bible and its laws as well as the efficacy of prayers and rituals; by 1907 he had informed his parents of his feelings. As he was already serving as a rabbi at this point, this created a high degree of dissonance resulting in considerable internal turmoil and anguish over the hypocrisy of practicing and preaching that which he no longer believed. His private diaries and papers reveal that he was tortured within because his beliefs about the nature of religion and of Judaism conflicted with his duties as the leader of an Orthodox congregation.

In 1908, he married Lena Rubin, left KJ, and was ordained as a rabbi by Rabbi Isaac Jacob Reines while on his honeymoon in Europe.

In 1909, Kaplan became principal of the newly formed teacher&#x27;s institute at JTS (which was now Conservative), a position he would keep until he retired in 1963. Kaplan was not primarily interested in academic scholarship; but rather in teaching future rabbis and educators to reinterpret Judaism and make Jewish identity meaningful under modern circumstances. As a result, his work during this time contributed greatly to the future of Jewish education in America.

Even those who disagreed with his views appreciated his direct approach. They were impressed by his emphasis on intellectual honesty in confronting the challenges posed by modern thought to traditional Jewish beliefs and practices. In his approach to midrash and philosophies of religion, Kaplan combined scientific scholarship with creative application of the texts to contemporary problems. Kaplan&#x27;s Reconstructionist philosophy influenced not only his own immediate students, but through them, his extensive writings, and public lectures over several decades, the American Jewish community at large. Many of his ideas, such as Judaism as a civilization (and not merely a religion or nationality); bat mitzvah; egalitarian involvement of women in synagogal and communal life; the synagogue as a Jewish center and not merely a place of worship; and living as Jews in a multicultural society, eventually came to be accepted as commonplace and implemented in all but strictly Orthodox segments of the community.

Early in his career, Kaplan became a devotee of the scientific and historical study of the Bible. He was the leading educator to confront rabbis, teachers, and laity with the changes in Jewish thought that had become necessary once the Bible had been exposed to modern techniques of examination and interpretation. But far from denigrating the genius of the biblical text, Kaplan taught his students to regard it as an indispensable source for an understanding of Jewish peoplehood and Jewish civilization.

In 1912, he was an advisor to the creators of the Young Israel movement of Modern Orthodox Judaism, together with Rabbi Israel Friedlander.

In speeches and articles in 1912 and 1916 he chided American Orthodox Judaism for not adequately embracing modernity.

He was a leader in creating the Jewish community center concept. Around 1916-1918 he organized the Jewish Center in New York, a community organization with a Modern Orthodox synagogue as its nucleus, the first of its kind in the United States, and was its rabbi until 1922.

Kaplan&#x27;s ideology and rhetoric had been evolving, over the decade, but it was not until 1920 that he finally took a clear and irrevocable stand, criticizing &quot;the fundamental doctrine of Orthodoxy, which is that tradition is infallible... The doctrine of infallibility rules out of court all research and criticism and demands implicit faith in the truth of whatever has come down from the past. It precludes all conscious development in thought and practice...&quot; However, he was even more critical of Reform, saying that Reform was worse due to what he called Reform&#x27;s &quot;absolute break with the Judaism of the past&quot;.

Yet he still remained the Rabbi of the center until around 1922, when he resigned due to these ideological conflicts with the some of lay leadership. He, along with a sizeable group of congregants, then established the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, which later became the core of the Reconstructionist movement.

He held the first public celebration of a bat mitzvah in the United States, for his daughter Judith Kaplan, on March 18, 1922, at the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, his synagogue in New York City. Judith read from the Torah at this ceremony, a role that had traditionally been reserved for males.

In 1925, the American Zionist Organization sent Kaplan to Jerusalem as its official representative for the opening of Hebrew University.

From 1934 until 1970 Kaplan wrote a series of books in which he expressed his Reconstructionist ideology, which was an attempt to adapt Judaism to modern-day realities that Kaplan believed created the necessity for a new conception of God. His basic ideology was first defined in his 1934 work &quot;Judaism as a Civilization: Toward the Reconstruction of American-Jewish Life&quot;. In 1935 a biweekly periodical (&quot;The Reconstructionist&quot;) was started under Kaplan&#x27;s editorship, which adopted the following credo: “Dedicated to the advancement of Judaism as a religious civilization, to the upbuilding of Eretz Yisrael [the Land of Israel] as the spiritual center of the Jewish People, and to the furtherance of universal freedom, justice, and peace.” Kaplan further refined the goals of his ideology in subsequent books including: &quot;The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion&quot; (1937), &quot;Judaism Without Supernaturalism&quot; (1958), and &quot;The Religion of Ethical Nationhood&quot; (1970).

Kaplan saw his ideology as a &quot;school of thought&quot; rather than a separate denomination, and in fact resisted pressure to turn it into one, fearing that it might further fragment the American Jewish community, and hoping that his ideas could be applied to all denominations.

Kaplan was dissatisfied with traditional rituals and prayer, and sought to find ways to make them more meaningful to modern Jews. In, 1941 he wrote a controversial Reconstructionist Haggadah, for which he received criticism from colleagues at JTS. However, he this did not stop him from publishing the Reconstructionist Sabbath Prayer Book 1945, in which, among other unorthodoxies, he denied the literal accuracy of the biblical text. As a result, he was excommunicated by the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of the United States and Canada, who held a herem ceremony at which his prayer book was burned.

Although Kaplan preferred Reconstructionism remain a non-denominational school of thought rather than a separate denomination, in the late 40s to early 50s a number of laymen in synagogues throughout the United States decided to organize an independent federation of Reconstructionist synagogues, and by 1954 the Federation of Reconstructionist Congregations and Havurot was organized. As the years passed, the number of affiliates grew, but it was not until the late 1960s, that the movement actually became a separate denomination, when the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College opened its doors in 1968. By the beginning of the 21st century it would include over 100 congregations and havurot.

Kaplan was a prolific writer. In addition to his published works, he kept a journal from 1913 until the late 1970s, with 27 volumes, each with 350 - 400 handwritten pages. The journal is certainly the largest by a Jew, and may even be one of the most extensive on record.

After the death of his wife in 1958, he married Rivka Rieger, an Israeli artist, in 1959. He died in New York City in 1983 at the age of 102. He was survived by Rivka and his daughters Dr. Judith Eisenstein, Hadassah Musher, Dr. Naomi Wenner and Selma Jaffe-Goldman; as well as seven grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.

==Relationship with Orthodox Judaism==
Kaplan began his career as an Orthodox rabbi at Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun in New York City, assisted in the founding of the Young Israel movement of Modern Orthodox Judaism in 1912, and was the first rabbi hired by the new (Orthodox) Jewish Center in Manhattan when it was founded in 1918. He proved too radical in his religious and political views for the organization and resigned from the Jewish Center in 1921. He was the subject of a number of polemical articles published by Rabbi Leo Jung (who became the rabbi of the Jewish Center in 1922) in the Orthodox Jewish press.

He then became involved in the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, where on March 18, 1922, he held (possibly) the first public celebration of a bat mitzvah in America, for his daughter Judith. This led to considerable criticism of Kaplan in the Orthodox Jewish press.

Kaplan&#x27;s central idea of understanding Judaism as a religious civilization was an easily accepted position within Conservative Judaism, but his naturalistic conception of God was not as acceptable. Even at the Conservative movement&#x27;s JTS, as &quot;The Forward&quot; writes, &quot;He was an outsider, and often privately considered leaving the institution. In 1941, the faculty illustrated its distaste with Kaplan by penning a unanimous letter to the professor of homiletics, expressing complete disgust with Kaplan&#x27;s &quot;The New Haggadah&quot; for the Passover seder. Four years later, seminary professors Alexander Marx, Louis Ginzberg and Saul Lieberman went public with their rebuke by writing a letter to the Hebrew newspaper &quot;Hadoar&quot;, lambasting Kaplan&#x27;s prayer book and his entire career as a rabbi.&quot; In 1945 the Union of Orthodox Rabbis &quot;formally assembled to excommunicate from Judaism what it deemed to be the community&#x27;s most heretical voice: Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, the man who eventually would become the founder of Reconstructionist Judaism. Kaplan, a critic of both Orthodox and Reform Judaism, believed that Jewish practice should be reconciled with modern thought, a philosophy reflected in his &quot;Sabbath Prayer Book&quot;...&quot;

Due to Kaplan&#x27;s evolving position on Jewish theology and the liturgy, he was also condemned as a heretic by members of Young Israel, which he had assisted in founding. His followers attempted to induce him to formally leave Conservative Judaism, but he stayed with its Jewish Theological Seminary until he retired in 1963. Finally, in 1968, his closest disciple and son-in-law Ira Eisenstein founded a separate school, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, in which Kaplan&#x27;s philosophy, Reconstructionist Judaism, would be promoted as a separate religious movement.

==University establishment==
Kaplan wrote a seminal essay &quot;On the Need for a University of Judaism,&quot; in which he called for a university setting that could present Judaism as a deep culture and developing civilization. His proposal included programs on dramatic and fine arts to stimulate Jewish artistic creativity, a college to train Jews to live fully in American and Jewish culture as contributing citizens, a school to train Jewish educators, and a rabbinical seminary to train creative and visionary rabbis. In 1947, with the participation of Rabbi Simon Greenberg, his efforts culminated in the establishment of the American Jewish University, then known as the University of Judaism. His vision continues to find expression in the graduate, undergraduate, rabbinical, and continuing education programs of the university.

==Kaplan&#x27;s theology==
Kaplan said: To believe in God means to accept life on the assumption that it harbors conditions in the outer world and drives in the human spirit which together impel man to transcend himself. To believe in God means to take for granted that it is man&#x27;s destiny to rise above the brute and to eliminate all forms of violence and exploitation from human society. In brief, God is the Power in the cosmos that gives human life the direction that enables the human being to reflect the image of God.

Not all of Kaplan&#x27;s writings on the subject were consistent; his position evolved somewhat over the years, and two distinct theologies can be discerned with a careful reading. The view more popularly associated with Kaplan is strict naturalism, à la Dewey, which has been criticized as using religious terminology to mask a non-theistic (if not outright atheistic) position - one JTS colleague in the 1950s, Will Herberg, went so far as to compare it to the position of Charles Maurras toward the Catholic Church. A second strand of Kaplanian theology makes clear that God has ontological reality, a real and absolute existence independent of human beliefs, while rejecting classical theism and any belief in miracles. In 1973 he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto II.

<text>Mathilde Roth Schechter (also Matilda; December 16, 1859 – August 27, 1924) was the American founder of the U.S. National Women&#x27;s League of Conservative Judaism in 1918.

==Biography==
Schechter was born in Breslau, Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland). She was married to Dr. Solomon Schechter, a prominent rabbi who was chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA). They lived in Cambridge, England before immigrating to the United States in 1902.

She founded and taught at the Columbia Religious and Industrial School for Jewish Girls. After assisting Henrietta Szold in creating Hadassah, Schechter later served as its national chairwoman of education. The Mathilde Schechter Residence Hall formerly contained undergraduate housing for students of the JTSA&#x27;s List College.

She died at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan on August 27, 1924, following an operation.

<text>MOS Technology, Inc. (&quot;MOS&quot; being short for Metal Oxide Semiconductor), later known as CSG (Commodore Semiconductor Group) and GMT Microelectronics, was a semiconductor design and fabrication company based in Audubon, Pennsylvania. It is most famous for its 6502 microprocessor and various designs for Commodore International&#x27;s range of home computers.

==History==
Three former General Instrument executives, John Paivinen, Mort Jaffe and Don McLaughlin, formed MOS Technology in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania in 1969. The Allen-Bradley Company was looking to provide a second source for electronic calculators and their chips designed by Texas Instruments (TI). In 1970 Allen-Bradley acquired a majority interest in MOS Technology. 

In the early 1970s, TI decided to release their own line of calculators, instead of selling just the chips inside them, and introduced them at a price that was lower than the price of the chipset alone. Many early chip companies were reliant on sales of calculator chips and were wiped out in the aftermath; those that survived did so by finding other chips to produce. MOS became a supplier to Atari, producing a custom single-chip &quot;Pong&quot; system.

Things changed dramatically in 1975. Several of the designers of the Motorola 6800 left Motorola shortly after its release, after management told them to stop working on a low-cost version of the design. At the time there was no such thing as a pure-play semiconductor foundry, so they had to join a chip-building company to produce their new CPU. MOS was a small firm with good credentials in the right area, the east coast of the US. The team of four design engineers was headed by Chuck Peddle and included Bill Mensch. At MOS they set about building a new CPU that would outperform the 6800 while being similar to it in purpose and much less expensive. The resulting 6501 design was somewhat similar to the 6800, but by using several design simplifications, the 6501 would be up to four times faster.

===Mask fixing===
Previous CPU designs, like the 6800, were produced using a device known as a contact aligner. This was essentially a complex photocopier, which optically reproduced a CPU design, or &quot;mask&quot;, on the surface of the silicon chip. The name &quot;contact&quot; referred to the fact that the mask was placed directly on the surface of the chip, which had the significant disadvantage that it sometimes pulled away materials from the chip, which were then copied to subsequent chips. This caused the mask to become useless after about a dozen copies, and resulted in the vast majority of chips having fatal flaws; for a complex chip like the 6800, only about 10% of the chips would work once the masking process was complete.

In 1974 Perkin-Elmer publicly introduced the Micralign system, the first projection scanner. Instead of placing the mask on the surface of the chip, it held it far from the surface and used highly accurate optics to project the image. Masks now lasted for thousands of copies instead of tens, and the flaw rate of the chips inverted so that perhaps 70% of the chips produced would work. The result was a similar inversion in pricing. The 6800 sold in small lots for ; with no other changes than using a Micralign, the same design could sell for .

The change to the Micralign revealed a further advantage. Previously the masks were mass-produced by photography companies like Kodak, who would make tens of thousands of copies of a master mask, or &quot;reticle&quot;, and ship the masks to the aligners by the truckload. This meant that if a flaw was found in the design, it would cost a significant amount of money to fix it, as all the older masks would have to be thrown out. In contrast, with Micralign there was only one mask per aligner, so there was no inherent cost in replacing the mask if need be, although the cost, and especially time, of producing these master masks was considerable.

MOS developed the ability to &quot;fix&quot; its masks after they had been produced. This meant that as flaws in the design were discovered, the masks could be removed from the aligners, fixed, and put back in. This allowed them to rapidly drive out flaws in the original masks.

The company&#x27;s production lines typically reversed the numbers others were achieving; even the early runs of a new CPU design—what would become the 6502—were achieving a success rate of 70 percent or better. This meant that not only were its designs faster, but they also cost much less as well.

===6502 family===

When the 6501 was announced, Motorola launched a lawsuit almost immediately. Although the 6501 instruction set was not compatible with the 6800, it could nevertheless be plugged into existing motherboard designs because it had the same functional pin arrangement and IC package footprint. That was enough to allow Motorola to sue. Allen-Bradley sold back its shares to the founders, sales of the 6501 basically stopped, and the lawsuit would drag on for many years before MOS was eventually forced to pay in fines.

In the meantime MOS had started selling the 6502, a chip capable of operating at in September 1975 for a mere . It was nearly identical to the 6501, with only a few minor differences: an added on-chip clock oscillator, a different functional pinout arrangement, generation of the SYNC signal (supporting single-instruction stepping), and removal of data bus enablement control signals (DBE and BA, with the former directly connected to the phase 2 clock instead). It outperformed the more-complex 6800 and Intel 8080, but cost much less and was easier to work with. Although it did not have the 6501&#x27;s advantage of being able to be used in place of the Motorola 6800 in existing hardware, it was so inexpensive that it quickly became more popular than the 6800, making that a moot point.

The 6502 was so cheap that many people believed it was a scam when MOS first showed it at a 1975 trade show. They were not aware of MOS&#x27;s masking techniques and when they calculated the price per chip at the current industry yield rates, it did not add up. But any hesitation to buy it evaporated when both Motorola and Intel dropped the prices on their own designs from to at the same show in order to compete. Their moves legitimized the 6502, and by the show&#x27;s end, the wooden barrel full of samples was empty.

The 6502 would quickly go on to be one of the most popular chips of its day. A number of companies licensed the 650x line from MOS, including Rockwell International, GTE, Synertek, and Western Design Center (WDC).

A number of different versions of the basic CPU, known as the 6503 through 6507, were offered in 28-pin packages for lower cost. The various models removed signal or address pins. Far and away the most popular of these was the 6507, which was used in the Atari 2600 and Atari disk drives. The 6504 was sometimes used in printers. MOS also released a series of similar CPUs using external clocks, which added a &quot;1&quot; to the name in the third digit, as the 6512 through 6515. These were useful in systems where the clock support was already being provided on the motherboard by some other source. The final addition was the &quot;crossover&quot; 6510, used in the Commodore 64, with additional I/O ports.

===Commodore Semiconductor Group===
However successful the 6502 was, the company itself was having problems. At about the same time the 6502 was being released, MOS&#x27;s entire calculator IC market collapsed, and its prior existing products stopped shipping. Soon they were in serious financial trouble. Another company, Commodore Business Machines (CBM), had invested heavily in the calculator market and was also nearly wiped out by TI&#x27;s entry into the market. A fresh injection of capital saved CBM, and allowed it to invest in company suppliers in order to help ensure their IC supply would not be upset in this fashion again. Among the several companies were LED display manufacturers, power controllers, and suppliers of the driver chips, including MOS.

In late 1976, CBM, publicly traded on the NYSE with a market capitalization around , purchased MOS (whose market cap was around ) in an all-stock deal. Holders of MOS received a 9.4 percent equity stake in CBM on the condition that Chuck Peddle would join Commodore as chief engineer. The deal went through, and while the firm basically became Commodore&#x27;s production arm, they continued using the name MOS for some time so that manuals would not have to be reprinted. After a while MOS became the Commodore Semiconductor Group (CSG). Despite being renamed to CSG, all chips produced were still stamped with the old &quot;MOS&quot; logo until week 22/23 of 1989.

MOS had previously designed a simple computer kit called the KIM-1, primarily to &quot;show off&quot; the 6502 chip. At Commodore, Peddle convinced the owner, Jack Tramiel, that calculators were a dead end, and that home computers would soon be huge.

However, the original design group appeared to be even less interested in working for Jack Tramiel than it had for Motorola, and the team quickly started breaking up. One result was that the newly completed 6522 (VIA) chip was left undocumented for years.

Bill Mensch left MOS even before the Commodore takeover, and moved home to Arizona. After a short stint consulting for a local company called ICE, he set up the Western Design Center (WDC) in 1978. As a licensee of the 6502 line, their first products were bug-fixed, power-efficient CMOS versions of the 6502 (the 65C02, both as a separate chip and embedded inside a microcontroller called the 65C150). But then they expanded the line greatly with the introduction of the 65816, a fairly straightforward 16-bit upgrade of the original 65C02 that could also run in 8-bit mode for compatibility. Since then WDC moved much of the original MOS catalog to CMOS, and the 6502 continued to be a popular CPU for the embedded systems market, like medical equipment and car dashboard controllers.

===GMT Microelectronics===
After Commodore&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1994, Commodore Semiconductor Group, MOS&#x27;s successor, was bought by its former management for about , plus an additional to cover miscellaneous expenses including a United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) license. Dennis Peasenell became CEO. In December 1994, the EPA entered into a Prospective Purchase Agreement (limiting the company&#x27;s liability in exchange for sharing the costs of cleanup) with GMT Microelectronics. In 1994, the company, operating under the name GMT Microelectronics (&quot;Great Mixed-signal Technologies&quot;), reopened MOS Technology&#x27;s original, circa-1970 one-micrometre process fab (semiconductor fabrication plant) in Audubon, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania that Commodore had closed in 1993.

The plant had been on the EPA&#x27;s National Priorities List of hazardous waste sites since October 4, 1989. This was due to a 1978 leak of trichloroethylene (TCE) from an underground 250-gallon concrete storage tank used by Commodore Business Machines in the semiconductor cleaning process. Leaks from the tank had caused the local groundwater to become contaminated with TCE and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in 1978. By 1999 GMT Microelectronics had in revenues and 183 employees working on the site. Announced in March 1999, GMT would have provided foundry services based on TelCom&#x27;s Bipolar and SiCr (silicon chromium) Thin Film Resistor processes and would have been a licensed alternate source for TelCom&#x27;s Bipolar based products, with production running at 10,000 5-inch semiconductor wafers per month, producing CMOS, BiCMOS, NMOS, bipolar and SOI (silicon on insulator) devices. In 2000, GMT Microelectronics discontinued operations and abandoned all of its assets at the Commodore Semiconductor Group superfund site.

<doc id="20707" wikidata="Q285514" url="?curid=20707" title="Margaret Sanger">
<text>Margaret Sanger (; Higgins; September 14, 1879September 6, 1966) was an American birth control activist, sex educator, writer, and nurse. She opened the first birth control clinic in the United States, founded Planned Parenthood, and collaborated in the development of the first birth control pill. Sanger is regarded as a founder and leader of the birth control movement.

Sanger worked as a nurse in the slums of New York City, where she often treated mothers desperate to avoid conceiving additional children, some of whom were suffering the effects of unsanitary back-alley abortions. Out of these encounters arose a determination to give women the power to choose when to have children. Her drive to promote birth control was influenced by Malthusian concerns about the detrimental effects of overpopulation. She was also an adherent of the eugenics movement, and believed that birth control would reduce the number of unfit people and improve the overall health of the human race. 

To promote birth control, Sanger gave speeches, wrote books, and published periodicals. She frequently provoked arrest by distributing birth control literature in contravention of obscenity laws. She was arrested several times, and each time she hoped to get a favorable legal ruling that would overturn laws that impeded birth control. She was responsible for several major legal victories, including one that enabled physicians to dispense contraceptives; and another &quot;Griswold v Connecticut&quot; which legalized contraception, without a prescription, for couples nationwide. 

Sanger established a network of dozens of birth control clinics across the country, which provided reproductive health services to hundreds of thousands of patients. She discouraged abortion, and her clinics never offered abortion services during her lifetime. She co-founded several organizations dedicated to family planning, including Planned Parenthood and International Planned Parenthood Federation. In the early 1950s, Sanger persuaded philanthropists to provide funding for biologist Gregory Pincus to develop the first birth control pill. She died in Arizona in 1966.

== Early life ==

Sanger&#x27;s parents were Irish Catholics who separately emigrated from Ireland. Her father, Michael Hennessey Higgins, immigrated to Canada with his family, then moved to the U.S. at the age of 14, and joined the Union army in the Civil War as a drummer at 15. Upon leaving the army, he studied medicine and phrenology but ultimately became a stonecutter. Her mother, Anne Purcell Higgins, immigrated to the U.S. with her family during the Great Famine.

Anne and Michael were married in 1869. In 22 years, Anne Higgins conceived 18 times, giving birth to 11 live babies before dying at the age of 49.

Sanger was born Margaret Louise Higgins September 14, 1879 in Corning, New York, the sixth of 11 surviving children. She spent her early years in a bustling household. Her father Michael was a free-thinker, a socialist, and an agnostic. 

With financial help from two elder sisters, Margaret Higgins attended the Hudson River Institute at Claverack College from 1896 to 1900, then nursing school at White Plains Hospital from 1900 to 1902. After graduating as a nurse, she married architect William Sanger in 1902. Although she suffered from tuberculosis, she settled down to a quiet life in Westchester, New York and had three children.

== Woman rebel ==

In 1911, after a fire destroyed their home in Hastings-on-Hudson, the Sangers abandoned the suburbs for a new life in New York City. Margaret Sanger worked as a nurse, making house calls in the slums of the East Side, while her husband worked as an architect and a house painter. The couple became active in local socialist politics. She joined the Women&#x27;s Committee of the Socialist Party of New York and took part in the labor actions of the Industrial Workers of the World, including the 1912 Lawrence textile strike and the 1913 Paterson silk strike. She socialized with the bohemian community of Greenwich Village, including local intellectuals, left-wing artists, socialists and social activists, such John Reed, Upton Sinclair, Mabel Dodge, and Emma Goldman.

Working as a nurse, Sanger visited many working-class immigrant women in their homes; many of them underwent frequent childbirth, miscarriages, and self-induced abortions. Availability of contraceptive information was limited, due to the Comstock Act, a federal anti-obscenity law which prohibitedamong other thingsmailing contraceptives, or even information about contraception. In 1913, she visited public libraries, searching for publications that instructed women how to avoid conception, but she found none.

The hardships women faced were epitomized in a story that Sanger would recount in her speeches: while she was working as a nurse, she was called to the apartment of a woman, &quot;Sadie Sachs&quot;, who had a severe sepsis infection due to a self-induced abortion. Sadie begged the attending doctor to tell her how she could prevent this from happening again. The doctor laughed and said &quot;You want your cake while you eat it too, do you? Well it can&#x27;t be done. I&#x27;ll tell you the only sure thing to do ... Tell Jake to sleep on the roof .&quot; A few months later, Sanger was called back to Sadie&#x27;s apartment, and found that Sadie had attempted yet another self-induced abortion; she died shortly after Sanger arrived. Sanger would sometimes end the story by saying, &quot;I threw my nursing bag in the corner and announced ... that I would never take another case until I had made it possible for working women in America to have the knowledge to control birth.&quot;

The Sadie Sachs episode was described by Sanger as the origin of her commitment to spare women from dangerous and illegal abortions. Sanger opposed abortion, not on theological grounds, but as a societal ill and public health dangerwhich would disappear, she believed, if women were able to prevent unwanted pregnancy.

Searching for a way to share her ideas with the public, she wrote two columns for the &quot;New York Call&quot; socialist magazine:&quot; What Every Mother Should Know&quot; (1911–12) and &quot;What Every Girl Should Know&quot; (1912–13). The columns gave advice to women and girls on love, masturbation, and sex; and emphasized the distinction between sex and love. By the standards of the day, Sanger&#x27;s articles were extremely frank in their discussion of sexuality, and many &quot;New York Call&quot; readers were outraged by them. Other readers, however, praised the series for its integrity and candor. Both series were published in book form in 1916.

Sanger&#x27;s political interests, her emerging feminism and her nursing experience led her to believe that only by liberating women from the risk of unwanted pregnancy would fundamental social change take place. In 1914, she undertook a decades-long campaign to free women, starting with &quot;The Woman Rebel&quot;, an eight-page monthly newsletter that used the slogan &quot;No Gods, No Masters.&quot; The newsletter contained articles about a variety of progressive subjects, including contraception, and was designed to challenge governmental censorship of contraceptive information through confrontation.

Sanger, collaborating with anarchist friends, popularized the term &quot;birth control&quot; as a more candid alternative to euphemisms such as &quot;family limitation&quot;; the term &quot;birth control&quot; was suggested in 1914 by a young friend, Otto Bobsein.

Sanger became estranged from her husband in 1913, and the couple&#x27;s divorce was finalized in 1921.

==Year as an outlaw==

Sanger&#x27;s first obstacle to educating women about contraception was the Comstock Actwhich banned dissemination of information about contraception. Her strategy was to deliberately violate the Act, hoping that the confrontation would eventually lead to amendment of the law. Throughout 1914, she attempted to mail copies of the monthly &quot;The Woman Rebel&quot; newsletter. Postal authorities intercepted five of its seven issues, but Sanger continued publication. In August that year, Sanger was finally arrested for sending &quot;The Woman Rebel&quot; through the postal system. 

While awaiting trial, she wrote a 16-page pamphlet, &quot;Family Limitation&quot;, which detailed several contraceptive methods, discussed marriage and sex, and chided husbands whoafter sex fell asleep without bringing their wife to a climax. Fearing arrest, several printers refused to print the pamphlet; she finally found a socialist printer willing to undertake the job, and he resorted to printing it secretly, at night. The pamphlet was very popular: 100,000 copies were printed of its first edition, it went through 18 editions, and it was translated into a dozen languages.

Facing imprisonment if she went to trial, she fled to Canada, where fellow activists forged a passport that permitted her to sail to England in early November. Sanger spent most of her self-imposed exile in England, where contact with British Malthusianssuch as Charles Vickery Drysdale and Bessie Drysdale helped refine her socioeconomic justifications for birth control. She shared the concern of Malthusians that overpopulation led to poverty, famine and war. She would return to Europe in 1922 to attend the Fifth International Neo-Malthusian Conferencewhere she became the first woman to chair a session; and she organized the Sixth International Neo-Malthusian and Birth-Control Conference that took place in New York in 1925. Overpopulation would remain a concern of hers for the rest of her life.

During her stay in England, she was profoundly influenced by British physician Havelock Ellisauthor of the multi-volume &quot;Studies in the Psychology of Sex&quot;. Under his tutelage, she expanded her birth control strategy to incorporate the additional benefit of stress-free, enjoyable sex; and came to adopt his view of sexuality as a powerful, liberating force.

Sanger returned from England in October 1915 to face trial. Before the December trial, her five-year old daughter died of pneumonia. She was offered a plea bargain, but refused, because she wanted to use the trial as a forum to advocate for the right of women to control their own bodies. The prosecutor dropped the charges because he did not want to turn Sanger into a martyr.

Early in 1915, Sanger&#x27;s estranged husband, William Sanger, gave a copy of &quot;Family Limitation&quot; to a representative of anti-vice politician Anthony Comstock. William was tried and convicted, spending thirty days in jail while attracting interest in birth control as an issue of civil liberty.

==The start of a movement ==
Some northern European countries had more liberal policies towards contraception than the United States; when Sanger visited a Dutch birth control clinic in 1915, she encountered diaphragms and became convinced that they were a more effective means of contraception than the suppositories and douches that she had been distributing back in the United States. Diaphragms were generally unavailable in the United States due to the Comstock Act, so Sanger and others began importing them from Europe, in defiance of United States law.

On October 16, 1916, Sanger opened a family planning and birth control clinicthe first in the United Statesin the Brownsville neighborhood of the Brooklyn borough of New York. Nine days after the clinic opened, Sanger was arrested for giving a birth control pamphlet to an undercover policewoman. After she bailed out of jail, she continued assisting women in the clinic until the police arrested her a second time. She and her sister, Ethel Byrne, were charged with distributing contraceptives in violation of New York state law.

Sanger and Byrne went to trial in January 1917. Byrne was convicted and sentenced to 30 days in a workhouse, where she went on a hunger strike. She was force-fed, the first woman hunger striker in the U.S. to be so treated. After ten dayswhen Sanger pledged that Byrne would never break the lawher sister was pardoned. Sanger was also convicted; the trial judge was not persuaded by Sanger&#x27;s argument that women had the right to enjoy sex without worrying about conceiving an unwanted child. Sanger was offered a more lenient sentence if she promised to not break the law again, but she refused and said: &quot;I cannot respect the law as it exists today.&quot; She was sentenced to 30 days in a workhouse.

An initial appeal was rejected, but in a subsequent court proceeding in 1918 (after Sanger had served her sentence) the birth control movement secured a major victory when the New York Court of Appeals (New York&#x27;s highest court) issued a ruling which allowed physicians in New York to dispense contraceptives. The publicity surrounding Sanger&#x27;s arrest, trial, and appeal sparked birth control activism across the United States, and generated momentum for the birth control movement.

In February 1917, Sanger began publishing the periodical &quot;Birth Control Review&quot;, serving as its editor until 1929. The magazine was published monthly until 1940.

In her 1920 book &quot;Woman and the New Race&quot;, Sanger framed her fight for birth control in the context of history, psychology, and feminism. She wrote that male-dominated institutions, such as the church and state, have prohibited birth control throughout historyleading women to have too many children, too closely spaced. This, in turn, was a direct cause of mental distress and social pathology, and prevented women women from full expression of their &quot;feminine spirit&quot;. Sanger asserted that women have always fought back against this oppression through secretive use of abortion, contraception, or infanticide. She believed that these efforts to limit family size were a manifestation of women&#x27;s desire for freedom, writing: 
From 1920–1921, and intermittently until his death in 1946, she had a love affair with the novelist H.G. Wells. In 1922, she married her second husband, businessman James Noah H. Slee.

==Organizing==
After World War I, Sanger continued to be frustrated by the inverted priorities of charities: they provided free obstetric and post-birth care to indigent women, yet failed to offer birth control or assistance in raising the children. She wrote: &quot;The poor woman is taught how to have her seventh child, when what she wants to know is how to avoid ... her eighth.&quot; Sanger saw a societal need to limit births by those least able to afford children: the affluent and educated already limited their childbearing, yet the poor and uneducated lacked access to contraception and information about birth control.

Support from wealthy donors in the early 1920s enabled Sanger to expand her reach beyond local, small-scale activism, and allowed her to organize the American Birth Control League (ABCL). The founding principles of the ABCL were:

The 1918 New York court decision had created an exception to the Comstock Act: contraceptives could be obtained, provided they were prescribed by a physician. To exploit this new loophole, in 1923 she established the Clinical Research Bureau (CRB)a medical clinic with physicians on staff. The CRB was the first birth control clinic in the U.S. that could dispense contraceptives directly to patients; and its staff of doctors, nurses, and social workers was entirely female. The clinic received extensive funding from John D. Rockefeller Jr. and his family, who continued to make anonymous donations to Sanger&#x27;s causes in subsequent decades.
In 1922, soon after the formation of the ABCL, Sanger raised her international profile by traveling to Asiagiving speeches in Korea, Japan, and China. She ultimately visited Japan seven times, working with Japanese feminist Kato Shidzue to promote birth control. 
In her role as president of the ABCL, she chafed at bureaucratic interference from second-generation reformers on the board of directors. Seeking more independence, in 1928 she resigned as the president of the ABCL and took full control of the CRB, renaming it the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau (BCCRB), marking the beginning of a schism that would last until 1939. By the 1930s, the BCCRB was serving over 10,000 patients per year, providing a range of gynecological services, conducting research, and training physicians and students.

In 1925, Sanger&#x27;s second husband, Noah Slee, contributed to the birth control movement by smuggling diaphragms into New York from Canada, hidden inside his company&#x27;s cargo. He then co-founded Holland-Rantosthe first manufacturer of legal diaphragms in the United States.

==Outreach and expansion==

Sanger invested a great deal of effort promoting birth control to the public. In 1916, she embarked on a cross-country lecture tour, speaking in dozens of cities at churches, women&#x27;s clubs, homes, and theaters. Her audience included workers, churchmen, liberals, socialists, scientists, and upper-class women. She once lectured on birth control to the women&#x27;s auxiliary of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) in Silver Lake, New Jersey. Explaining her decision to address them, Sanger said that she was willing to speak to any group that would listen, if it helped promote the birth control cause. She described the experience as weird, and reported that she had the impression that the audience were dull, and so she spoke to them in the simplest possible language, as if talking to children.

She wrote several books which had a nationwide impact in promoting the cause of birth control. Between 1920 and 1926, she sold 567,000 copies of &quot;Woman and the New Race&quot; and her 1922 book &quot;The Pivot of Civilization&quot;. She wrote two autobiographies, both aimed at promoting birth control: &quot;Margaret Sanger: My Fight for Birth Control&quot; published in 1931; and &quot;Margaret Sanger An Autobiography&quot; published in 1938. 

During the 1920s, Sanger received hundreds of thousands of letters, many of them written in desperation by women begging for information on how to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Many of the letters were printed in the monthly &quot;Birth Control Review&quot;, and 470 of these letters were compiled into the 1928 book, &quot; Motherhood in Bondage.&quot;

Throughout the 1920s, Sanger and the ABCL expanded outward from their New York base by creating a network of birth control clinics across the country: Chicago (1924), Los Angeles (1925), San Antonio (1926), Detroit and Baltimore (1927), Cleveland, Newark, and Denver (1928), and Atlanta, Cincinnati, and Oakland (1929). These clinics were managed by local birth control advocates, and funded by local donors. Those that met Sanger&#x27;s standards became official affiliates of the BCCRB. A survey in 1930 showed that twelve of the clinics were, collectively, seeing a total of about 8,000 new patients per year.

== African American community ==
Women of all races and religions were served by Sanger&#x27;s birth control clinics. Sanger did not tolerate bigotry among her staff, nor would she tolerate any refusal to work within interracial projects. By 1929 about 12% of clinic patients listed Harlem as their address. 

In 1924, James H. Hubert, an African American social worker and the leader of New York&#x27;s Urban League, asked Sanger to consider opening a clinic in an African American neighborhood. In response, she established a clinic in the Columbus Hill neighborhood of New York City, but the clinic operated for only three months before closing due to low patient numbers. 

In 1929, Hubert approached Sanger again, this time suggesting a clinic in Harlem.
Sanger secured funding from the Julius Rosenwald Fund and opened the clinic in 1930. The clinic was supported by an all-African American advisory board of 15 members and exclusively employed African American staff, including doctors, nurses, and social workers. The clinic was publicized in the African American press as well as in African American churches, and it received the approval of W. E. B. Du Bois, the co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the editor of its magazine, &quot;The Crisis.&quot; The clinic&#x27;s clientele was about half African American and half white, and almost 3,000 patients visited the clinic in its first year and a half. The Harlem clinic provided contraceptives and information to thousands of African American women until it closed in the mid 1940s.

In June 1932, Sanger published a special issue of &quot;Birth Control Review&quot; titled &quot;The Negro Number&quot;. Seven African American authorsincluding W.E.B Du Bois, George Schuyler, and Charles S. Johnsoncontributed articles to the issue, providing reasons why contraception was beneficial for the African American community.

During the 1920s and 1930s, Sanger toured the South and observed that African American women were neglected by the medical establishment, particularly in segregated areas. In 1939, she worked with fellow birth control advocates Mary Lasker and Clarence Gamble to create the Negro Project, an effort to deliver information about birth control to impoverished African American people. Sanger knew that the church played an important role in African American communities, so she advised Gamble (both Sanger and Gamble were white) on the importance of affiliating with African American ministers, writing:

When African American academic and activist Angela Davis analyzed that quote, she interpreted the passage as an indication that the birth control movement had been &quot;robbed of its progressive potential&quot; and had evolved into a &quot;racist strategy of population control.&quot; This claim has frequently been repeated by anti-abortion activists, leading many people to believe that Sanger was racist. However, most scholars interpret the passage as Sanger&#x27;s effort to prevent the spread of unfounded rumors about nefarious purposes, and they find no evidence that Sanger was a racist.

After the Negro Project was initiated, management was handed to the Birth Control Federation of America. The project lasted from 1940 to 1943, but was unsuccessful: no new clinics were established, and participation rates remained low.

== Planned Parenthood==
In 1929, Sanger formed the National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control to lobby for legislation to overturn restrictions on contraception. The lobbying did not produce results, so Sanger changed tack and in 1933 she ordered diaphragms from Japan to trigger a decisive battle in the courts. The diaphragms were seized by the U.S. government, and Sanger&#x27;s subsequent legal challenge to the confiscation led to a breakthrough 1936 court decision&quot;United States v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries&quot; which permitted physicians to dispense contraceptives nationwide. This court victory motivated the American Medical Association to adopt contraception as a normal medical service (1937) and a key component of medical school curriculums (1942).

Eager to take advantage of the &quot;One Package of Japanese Pessaries &quot; court rulingwhich permitted birth control clinics across the country to begin dispensing contraceptives leaders of the birth control movement took steps in 1937 to mend the rift between the ABCL and the BCCRB. The two organizations merged in 1939 as the Birth Control Federation of America and, simultaneously, Sanger stepped down from her role as President/Chairman. She no longer wielded the same power as she had in the early years of the movement, and in 1942 more conservative forces within the organization changed the name to Planned Parenthood Federation of America, a name Sanger objected to because she considered it too euphemistic.

In the late 1940s, Sanger reduced her involvement in Planned Parenthood, and turned her attention to improving access to birth control globally. In 1948 she founded an exploratory committeethe International Committee on Planned Parenthoodwhich brought together representatives from birth control organizations in several countries around the world. Four years later, in 1952, the committee evolved into the International Planned Parenthood Federation, whichis the world&#x27;s largest family planning NGO, consisting of 150 Member Associations working in 146 countries. Sanger was the organization&#x27;s first president and served in that role from 1952 to 1959.

In the early 1950s, Sanger persuaded philanthropist Katharine McCormick to provide funding for biologist Gregory Pincus to develop the first birth control pill, which was eventually sold under the name Enovid. Pincus recruited John Rock, a gynecologist at Harvard, to investigate clinical use of progesterone to prevent ovulation. Pincus would later say that Sanger&#x27;s role was essential in the development of the pill.

The Japanese government invited Sanger to Tokyo in 1954 to address the National Dietshe was the first foreigner to do sowhere she gave a speech on &quot;Population Problems and Family Planning&quot;.

In the late 1930s, Sanger began spending the winters in Tucson, Arizona, intending to play a less critical role in the birth control movement. She moved to Arizona full-time in 1943, after her husband died. In spite of her intention to retire, she remained active in the birth control movement through the 1950s.

== Death ==
Faced with declining health, Sanger moved into a convalescent home at age 83. Before her death, the U.S. Supreme Court decided &quot;Griswold v Connecticut&quot;, which struck down state laws prohibiting birth control in the United States. The defendant in that case, Estelle Griswold, was the director of the Connecticut affiliate of Planned Parenthood. A year before Sanger died, the Japanese government bestowed upon her the Order of the Precious Crown in recognition of her contributions to Japanese society. She died of congestive heart failure in 1966 in Tucson, Arizona, aged 86. Her funeral was held at St. Philip&#x27;s in the Hills Episcopal Church in Tucson, followed a month later by a memorial service at St. George&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Manhattan. Sanger is buried in Fishkill, New York, next to her sister, Nan Higgins, and her second husband, Noah Slee.

== Views ==

=== Abortion ===

In the early 1900s, when Sanger started as an activist, abortion was illegal throughout the United Statesthough medically necessary abortions were permitted in some states. Although abortion was illegal, it was widespread: in 1930, there were an estimated 800,000 illegal abortions performed in the U.S., resulting in 8,000 to 17,000 woman&#x27;s deaths from complications. Abortion frequency ranged from an estimated one abortion per five live births, to one abortion per 2.5 live births. Despite the high rates of morbidity and death from back-alley abortions, there was no prospect of legalizing abortion in Sanger&#x27;s era; serious efforts to legalize abortion did not begin in the U.S. until the mid-1950s. 
Sanger focused all her efforts on promoting contraception, rather than campaigning to make abortion legal. In her view, contraception was beneficial for many reasons: it was safe, simple, inexpensive, reduced the number of unwanted pregnancies, addressed overpopulation, andmost importantlyit eliminated the need for dangerous abortions. Historian Peter Engelman notes an irony in Sanger&#x27;s desire to end abortions: &quot;... the birth control movement of the early 20th century, which evolved into a reproductive rights movement that vowed to make and keep abortion legal, set out initially to end the practice of abortion, which was then illegal.&quot;

The majority of the educational material that Sanger produced was focused on contraception, and abortion was rarely mentioned. In her &quot;Family Limitation&quot; pamphlet, published in 1914, she wrote that every woman is entitled to make a choice of whether to have an abortion or not, and she suggested (incorrectly) that quinine could be used to induce abortion. That pamphlet was the only time she mentioned a technique for abortion. 

Numerous public statements from Sanger make it clear that she strongly discouraged abortions. When she opened her first birth control clinic in 1916, she distributed flyers to women, exhortingin all capitals&quot;Do not kill, do not take life, but prevent.&quot; After Pope Pius XI published an encyclical on sex, &quot;Of Chaste Wedlock&quot;, Sanger wrote a critical reply in 1932, which included: 

Abortions were not performed at clinics managed by Sanger. Through the 1920s, staff were not even permitted to refer patients to physicians (in other facilities) for medically necessary abortions. After nine years of clinic operations, in 1932, Sanger authorized the staff to refer patients to hospitals for medically necessary abortions. Planned Parenthood clinics would not offer abortions until 1970, several years after Sanger&#x27;s death.

Despite Sanger&#x27;s public statements denouncing abortion for the purpose of limiting family size, historian Jean Baker suggests that Sanger privately felt that the procedure was ethicalbut only as a last resort.

=== Free speech ===
Advocates for birth control employed a variety of tactics. Some, such as Mary Dennett, preferred to work peacefully within the legislative system, and tried to amend the Comstock Act through lobbying. But Sanger chose to treat the undertaking as a battle for free speech, and repeatedly broke anti-obscenity laws, hoping to provoke arrest, whichshe hoped would lead to legal decisions in her favor. 

Sanger was exposed to free speech principles early in her career: in New York, Emma Goldman introduced Sanger to physician Edward Bliss Foote and laywer Theodore Schroeder, co-founders of the Free Speech League. Inspired by fellow free speech advocates, in 1914 she published &quot;The Woman Rebel&quot; with the express goal of triggering a legal challenge to the Comstock anti-obscenity laws banning dissemination of information about contraception. The Free Speech League provided funding and advice to help Sanger with legal battles.

One of the most formidable opponents to birth control in the 1920s was the Catholic Church, which often tried to prevent Sanger from giving speeches. Catholics persuaded the Syracuse city council to ban Sanger from giving a speech in 1924; the National Catholic Welfare Conference lobbied against birth control; the Knights of Columbus boycotted hotels that hosted birth control events; the Catholic police commissioner of Albany prevented Sanger from speaking there; and several newsreel companies, succumbing to pressure from Catholics, refused to cover stories related to birth control. Sanger turned some of the boycotted speaking events to her advantage by inviting the press, and the resultant news coverage often generated public sympathy for her cause.

Numerous times in her career, local government officials prevented Sanger from speaking by shuttering a facility or threatening her hosts. In 1929, city officials under the leadership of Boston&#x27;s Catholic mayor James Curley threatened to arrest her if she spoke. In response she stood on stage, silent, with a gag over her mouth, while Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr. read a statement from Sanger: 

Over the course of her career, Sanger was arrested several times for speaking or publishing prohibited information.

=== Eugenics ===
Eugenics was one of many social reform movements that swept across America during the Progressive Erawhich stretched from about 1890 to 1930. During the 1920s, when Margaret Sanger&#x27;s work was gaining momentum, eugenics was a popular movement, promoted by major organizations, led by intellectuals and scientists, and funded by corporate foundations. 

Eugenic beliefs in the early 1900s covered a wide spectrum: at one extreme were those who overtly claimed the white race was superior, and wanted to reduce the population of certain other ethnicities. At the other extreme were altruists who wanted to improve the health and well-being of the entire human race. Many eugenicists were somewhere between: they did not categorize ethnicities as superior or inferior; but their list of unfit traits included attributes such as illiteracy or low scores on IQ tests whicheven if well-intendedoften had the effect of targeting certain ethnicities. 

Sanger was surrounded by influential people who approved of eugenics, including close friends Havelock Ellis and H. G. Wells, and colleagues W. E. B. Du Bois and Winston Churchill. Some associates of Sanger used eugenics to support their white supremacist beliefs, including Charles Davenport and Lothrop Stoddard, a member of the KKK, and a founding board member of the ABCL who contributed an article to &quot;Birth Control Review&quot;.

Sanger found common ground between eugenics and her birth control movement: both endeavors would benefit if contraception were legal and readily available. From her perspective as an activist struggling to develop support for her cause, Sanger viewed the eugenics movement as scientific, respectable, growing, international, and popular. Sanger adopted eugenics because it was an opportunity to advocate for the legalization of contraceptioneugenics was a means to her end. Whether she genuinely believed in eugenic principles is a matter of debate; several historians conclude that her belief was not sincere, and suggest that she joined with the eugenics movement simply to lend legitimacy to her birth control efforts.

Her support of eugenics was first manifested in 1917, when she published an article on eugenics by Paul Popenoe in her periodical &quot;Birth Control Review&quot;. From 1919 to 1921 she wrote several articles on the subject, leading to her
1922 book focused on eugenics, &quot;The Pivot of Civilization&quot;.

====Sanger&#x27;s approach to eugenics====

Sanger adopted the fundamental eugenic goal of reducing the number of unfit people. In that group, she included people who were insane, syphilitic, &quot;paupers, morons, feeble-minded, mentally and morally deficient persons&quot;; and included &quot;reckless&quot; people that were incapable of restraining themselves from having an excessive number of offspring.
To reduce the number of unfit children, Sanger initially emphasized contraceptives, which set her apart from mainstream eugenicists, who preferred sterilization. However, when the U.S. Supreme court decided that involuntary sterilization was legal in 1927, she began to endorse voluntary sterilization (in addition to contraception). She also began to support involuntary sterilizations for parents who were incapable of managing their own fertility and were likely to produce disabled children. About 60,000 Americans were sterilized involuntarily between 1927 and World War II.

Sanger&#x27;s approach to eugenics was heavily influenced by her feminism, which led her to deviate from mainstream eugenics in several ways: She supported the right of fit parents to limit the size of their families; whereas mainstream eugenicists felt it was the duty of fit parents to have a large number of offspring. And Sanger believed that motherswith some exceptionsshould individually regulate their family size; whereas mainstream eugenicists believed government mandates should be employed. 

Her eugenic proposals did not target specific ethnicities: instead, her goal was to improve the health of the whole human race by reducing the reproduction of those who were considered unfit. When she used the word &quot;race&quot; in the context of eugenics, the word invariably meant the entire human race, rather than a specific ethnicity; when she used the word &quot;unfit&quot; she meant an inherited defect, not an ethnicity. The consensus of scholars is that Sanger was not racist, but her collaboration with eugenicists indirectly assisted racist causes. African American academic Dorothy Roberts, author of &quot;Killing the Black Body&quot;, wrote &quot;Sanger did not tie fitness for reproduction to any particular ethnic group. It appears that Sanger was motivated by a genuine concern to improve the health of poor mothers she served rather than a desire to eliminate their stock.&quot; Roberts&#x27; assessment is echoed by other scholars, including scholar Carole McCann, historian Peter Engelman, and biographer Ellen Chesler.

Sanger had affiliated with eugenicists in the hope of gaining their support for her birth control movementbut her devotion was not reciprocated: the American Eugenics Society refused to accept any papers submitted by Sanger, most eugenicists ridiculed the birth control movement, and only a few would associate with her. The reasons were that Sanger was a woman, she had no academic credentials, and she insisted that mothers should have the power to decide if and when to have childrenwhich ran contrary to the mainstream eugenic policy that the state should order fit women to produce abundant offspring.

== Legacy and honors ==
Sanger achieved her goal of improving the well-being of women around the world through family planning: contraception is now legal in the U.S., family planning clinics are commonplace, contraception is taught in medical schools, tens of millions of women have made use of Planned Parenthood services, and hundreds of millions of women around the globe have access to birth control pills. As a result, Sanger is viewed today as an important first-wave feminist, and a founder and leader of the birth control movement.
Sanger&#x27;s writings are curated by two universities: New York University&#x27;s history department maintains the &quot;Margaret Sanger Papers Project&quot;, and Smith College&#x27;s Sophia Smith Collection maintains the &quot;Margaret Sanger Papers&quot; collection.

Several biographers have documented Sanger&#x27;s life, including David Kennedy, whose 1970 book &quot;Birth Control in America: The Career of Margaret Sanger&quot; won the Bancroft Prize and the John Gilmary Shea Prize. Television films &quot;Portrait of a Rebel: The Remarkable Mrs. Sanger&quot; and &quot;Choices of the Heart: The Margaret Sanger Story&quot; have portrayed Sanger&#x27;s life as well as two graphic novels.

Martin Luther King Jr. praised Sanger&#x27;s work in his acceptance speech for the 1966 Margaret Sanger Award: &quot;[Sanger] went into the slums and set up a birth control clinic, and for this deed she went to jail because she was violating an unjust law... She launched a movement which is obeying a higher law to preserve human life under humane conditions... Our sure beginning in the struggle for equality by nonviolent direct action may not have been so resolute without the tradition established by Margaret Sanger.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; magazine designated Sanger as one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century. Between 1953 and 1963, Sanger was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize 31 times. In 1957, the American Humanist Association named her Humanist of the Year. There is a bust of Sanger in the National Portrait Gallery, which was a gift from Cordelia Scaife May. Smith College awarded Sanger an honorary doctorate degree in 1949. In 1966, Planned Parenthood began issuing its Margaret Sanger Awards annually to honor &quot;individuals of distinction in recognition of excellence and leadership in furthering reproductive health and reproductive rights&quot;. In 1981, Sanger was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In 1993, the United States National Park Service designated the Margaret Sanger Clinicwhere she provided birth-control services in New York in the mid-twentieth centuryas a National Historic Landmark. Government authorities and other institutions have memorialized Sanger by dedicating several landmarks in her name, including a room in Wellesley College&#x27;s library, and Margaret Sanger Square in New York City&#x27;s Noho area. There is a Margaret Sanger Lane in Plattsburgh, New York and an Allée Margaret Sanger in Saint-Nazaire, France. Her speech &quot;The Children&#x27;s Era&quot;, given in 1925, is listed as #81 in American Rhetoric&#x27;s Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century. Sanger, a crater in the northern hemisphere of Venus, is named after her.

===Attacks by anti-abortion activists ===
Since the legalization of abortion in 1973, Sanger has become a target of frequent attacks by opponents of abortion. The attacks usually include falsehoods, and they often attribute quotes to Sanger that are either fabricated or presented out of context. Common falsehoods are: she was a racist, she was a proponent of abortion, she was a Nazi sympathizer, or she supported the KKK. Another persistent falsehood is the claim that Sanger applied her birth control policies with the intention of suppressing the African American community.

Beginning in 2015, Planned Parenthoodhoping to improve relations with minority communitiestook steps to distance itself from its founder: it removed Sanger&#x27;s name from its annual awards, published an editorial in which it repudiated Sanger&#x27;s advocacy of eugenics, and removed Sanger&#x27;s name from its family planning clinic in Manhattan. Essayist Katha Pollitt and Sanger biographer Ellen Chesner criticized Planned Parenthood for succumbing to pressure from the anti-abortion movement.

<text>Mobil Oil Corporation, now known as just Mobil, is a petroleum brand owned and operated by American oil and gas corporation ExxonMobil, formerly known as Exxon, which took its current name after it and Mobil merged in 1999.

A direct descendant of Standard Oil, Mobil was originally known as the Standard Oil Company of New York (shortened to Socony) after Standard Oil was split into 43 different entities in a 1911 Supreme Court decision. Socony merged with Vacuum Oil Company, from which the Mobil name first originated, in 1931 and subsequently renamed itself to &quot;Socony-Vacuum Oil Company&quot;. Over time, Mobil became the company&#x27;s primary identity, which prompted a renaming in 1955 to the &quot;Socony Mobil Oil Company&quot;, and then in 1966 to the &quot;Mobil Oil Corporation&quot;. Mobil credits itself with being the first company to introduce paying at the pump at its gas stations, the first company to produce jet aviation fuel, as well as the first company to introduce a mobile payment device, today known as Speedpass.

In 1998, Mobil announced it was merging with Exxon to form ExxonMobil, reuniting the two largest descendants of Standard Oil. The technicalities of the merger, which was completed on November 30, 1999, showed that Exxon bought Mobil, and Mobil shareholders received a payment of stock in Exxon. Mobil continues as a brand name within the combined company, as well as still being a gas station sometimes paired with its own store or On the Run. Mobil&#x27;s brand name is primarily used to market motor oils, such as Mobil 1. The former Mobil headquarters in Fairfax County, Virginia, was used as ExxonMobil&#x27;s downstream headquarters until 2015 when ExxonMobil consolidated employees into a new corporate campus in Spring, Texas.

== History ==
==Brands==

Mobil continues to operate as a major brandname of ExxonMobil within the ExxonMobil Fuels, Lubricants &amp; Specialties division. Many of its products feature the Mobil symbol of a red winged horse, Pegasus, which has been a company trademark since its affiliation with Magnolia Petroleum Company in the 1930s.

The Mobil brand now mainly covers a wide range of automotive, industrial, aviation and marine lubricants. For historic reasons, the Mobil brand is still used by Mobil service stations and for fuel (gasoline, diesel, heating oil, kerosene, aviation fuels and marine fuel) products.

There are four main Mobil sub-brands:

===Mobil Gasoline===
Mobil is ExxonMobil&#x27;s primary retail gasoline brand in California, Florida, New York, New England, the Great Lakes and the Midwest. The Mobil brand is also used to market gasoline in Australia, Canada (since 2017), Colombia, Egypt, Guam, Japan (until 2019), Malaysia (until 2012), Mexico (starting about first quarter of 2018), New Zealand, Nigeria, Puerto Rico (since 2022) and Guyana (since 2024)

The Mobil brand has a significant market presence in the following metropolitan areas:

*New York metropolitan area (including New Jersey since 2014)
*Detroit
*Chicago
*Los Angeles
*Minneapolis-St. Paul
*Boston
*Buffalo
*St. Louis
*Tampa-St. Petersburg
*Miami-Fort Lauderdale
*Rochester-Syracuse
*Orlando
*Milwaukee
*Providence
*Albany 
*Hartford
Mobil stores have made an increased presence in Arizona. Growing in size in the Phoenix area from fewer than 5 stations to over 20 in the mid-2010s, but in recent years the number of stations dwindled down back to 5. Mobil previously had a greater presence in the Phoenix area up until April 2009, when ExxonMobil sold 43 area stores to Alimentation Couche-Tard, parent company of Circle K, as part of a sale of the larger On the Run franchise. The stores were rebranded to Circle K, ending Mobil&#x27;s presence in the Phoenix area until the mid-2010s. At the time, the closest Mobil locations were in Tonopah and Wickenburg, Arizona, both of which were unaffected by the sale as both locations were not On the Run franchises.

Also in the 2010s, Mobil stores have made an increased presence in Colorado, particularly in the Denver area, and in areas of northwest Oregon, southwest Washington, and northern California.

Exxon is the primary brand in the rest of the United States, with the highest concentration of Exxon retail outlets located in New Jersey (both Exxon and Mobil brands are used from 2014), Pennsylvania, Texas (Mobil has a sizeable number of stations in Dallas and Houston), Louisiana (mainly New Orleans as well as Baton Rouge) and in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states. Esso is ExxonMobil&#x27;s primary gasoline brand worldwide. Both the Esso and Mobil brands are used in Canada (since 2017), Colombia, Egypt, and formerly Japan and Malaysia, in which the latter were rebranded as Petron in 2013, and ENEOS for the former in 2019, separately. In Esso stations in Hong Kong and Singapore, the Mobil brand is used on fuel tanks, along with Esso.

===Mobil 1===
Mobil 1, the successor to the Mobiloil brand, is a brand name of Exxon/ESSO Mobil. It was introduced in 1974 as a Multi-grade 5W20 viscosity synthetic motor oil. The brand now includes multi-grade motor oils, oil filters, synthetic grease, transmission fluids, and gear lubricants. The Esso and Exxon motor oil brands have largely been discontinued.

===Mobil Delvac===
Mobil Delvac is a range of heavy-duty lubricants designed for commercial vehicles. The range includes engine oils, transmission fluids, drivetrain lubricants and various greases.

===Mobil Industrial===
Mobil Industrial is a sub-brand of ExxonMobil for marketing oils and greases used in industrial applications. The main product lines are Mobil SHC synthetic oils and Mobil Grease greases.

===On the Run Convenience Stores===

Mobil expanded the sale of convenience store items first pioneered at its discount gasoline stations under the Mobil Mart brand. Mobil continued to refine and enhance its convenience store offerings with the On-the-Run brand, which proved to be much more popular. In 2009, 450 On the Run stores in the United States was sold to Alimentation Couche-Tard, operator of the Circle K convenience store chain. Some other On the Run locations in the United States were sold to 7-Eleven in 2011. ExxonMobil continues to own the On the Run stores worldwide.

==Former brands==
===Discount gasoline stations===

Mobil rebranded numerous stations to the Hi-Val, Reelo and Sello discount gasoline brands after major price increases following the 1970s oil crisis made a significant number of consumers extremely price conscious. The stations were converted Mobil stations selling convenience store items in the station lobby, while the service bays were rented to customers for do-it-yourself auto repairs. These brands were discontinued in the 1980s, after the gasoline market had recovered.

===Mobil Travel Guide===
The Mobil Guide was an annual book of hotel and restaurant recommendations based on a system developed by Mobil in 1958. It rated businesses from one to five stars according to their assessed quality. In October 2009, ExxonMobil licensed the brand to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, which retitled the guide&#x27;s various designations, e.g., Forbes Travel Guide, Forbes Five Stars, and so on. Forbes launched revised versions of various guides in late 2009.

==Mobil outside of the United States==
=== Mobil UK ===
Vacuum Oil Company started selling lubricating oils in Europe in the late 19th century. By the 1930s its Mobiloil had become one of the main brands. Mobil gradually expanded its operation into fuels retailing as well, and opened its first UK service stations in the early 1950s, after the wartime POOL monopoly was disbanded. Mobil grew to become the seventh largest brand of petrol in Britain, supplying 1,990 outlets in 1965, and claimed in the mid-1960s to be the first company to operate 100 self-service stations. As well as its downstream interests, Mobil was active in the North Sea and operated an oil refinery in Coryton (opened in 1953), on the Thames estuary. In 1996, Mobil&#x27;s fuels operations in Europe were placed into a joint venture 70% owned by BP, and the Mobil brand disappeared from service stations. Mobil continued to sell lubricants through BP and independent service stations. Following Mobil&#x27;s merger with Exxon, at the start of 2000 BP acquired all the petrol retailing assets as well as the Coryton refinery (but sold it to Petroplus in 2007). Mobil returned to being purely a lubricant brand in Europe, and became the premium quality oil on sale at Esso service stations.

=== Mobil Australia ===
The Vacuum Oil Company began operating in Australia in 1895, introducing its Plume brand of petrol in 1916. The Flying Red Horse (Pegasus) logo was introduced in 1939, and in 1954, the Plume brand was replaced by Mobilgas.

Mobil Australia&#x27;s corporate office is in Melbourne. In 1946, Mobil began construction of its refinery at Altona, in Melbourne&#x27;s western suburbs, which originally produced lubricating oils and bitumen, before commencing the production of motor vehicle fuels in 1956. A second refinery at Port Stanvac, south of Adelaide, came on-stream in 1963, but was closed in 2003. Mobil commenced removal of the refinery in July 2009, together with site remediation works.
In 1985, Mobil swapped its Western Australian retail market with a large portion of BP&#x27;s South Australian, Victorian and New South Wales retail market in a major asset swap. In 1990, Mobil acquired the service station and refining network of Esso Australia. This also resulted in Mobil&#x27;s full ownership of Petroleum Refineries (Australia) Pty Ltd, which also operated the Altona and Adelaide Refineries. In December 1995, Mobil re-entered the West Australian retail fuel market when it purchased the Amgas service station network and related business.

On 27 May 2009, Caltex Australia announced it would be acquiring 302 Mobil service stations in Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney and Adelaide, subject to approval of the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC). The ACCC subsequently announced its opposition to the takeover, citing the likelihood of increased fuel prices due to diminished competition.

On 27 May 2010, 7-Eleven announced that it had acquired Mobil&#x27;s Australian network of 295 service stations, with fuel still to be supplied by Mobil. At the same time, it was announced that out of the 295 stations, 7-Eleven had sold 29 South Australian service stations to Peregrine Corporation. Peregrine&#x27;s acquisition saw Mobil&#x27;s sites in South Australia rebranded to On the Run (later OTR) convenience stores, but they continued to be supplied by Mobil until it was switched to BP. Meanwhile, since January 2012, all fuel in 7-Eleven stores are supplied by Mobil. 7-Eleven store renovations and openings since 2014 have included prominent placement of the Mobil logo (as the advertised fuel supplier), usually underneath the 7-Eleven logo, on main signage as well as on petrol pumps.
After the 7-Eleven sale, Mobil has since returned to the country with its own-branded service stations. , Mobil operates 229 own-branded service stations across the country, majority in the Australian east coast (except Tasmania) and South Australia but unfortunately, most rebranded to BP. There was also a few in Western Australia.

=== Mobil New Zealand ===
Mobil is the oldest oil company in New Zealand. Its kerosene first appeared in the country under the Standard Oil brand in the 1870s. Early in 1896, Vacuum Oil of New York established a marketing office on Featherston Street in Wellington selling lamp oil and harness grease. It brought with it extensive collective production, marketing and management skills that presented a major advancement in business organisation. The company&#x27;s unrivaled mineral lubricant products and associated services quickly dominated the market.
When New Zealanders began taking to the motorcar in the early twentieth century, Vacuum Oil expanded into the oil refining business. Its marketing network and transportation fleet grew as it extended its range of operation. The company continued to meet New Zealand&#x27;s fuel needs throughout World War One, holding roughly 85 percent of the market. After the war, Vacuum Oil began facing very strong competition, with a number of multinational oil companies which establishing operations in New Zealand. Among these competitors was the Atlantic Union Oil Company, another of the companies from which ExxonMobil is descended.

Atlantic Union was bought by the New Jersey–based Standard Oil Company, which would later become Exxon, and its eastern hemisphere interests were merged with those of Socony-Vacuum Oil Company to create the Standard-Vacuum Oil Company. The new company continued operations in New Zealand under both the Vacuum and Atlantic Union brand names.

On November 30, 1999, Exxon Corporation and Mobil Oil Corporation merged with Mobil Oil New Zealand Limited now owned by new entity ExxonMobil. The company currently owns a 17.2 percent share in The New Zealand Refining Company Limited which operates an oil refinery at Marsden Point. It supplies roughly 20 percent of the total fuels market in New Zealand, for which most of its products are sourced from the Marsden Point refinery. Mobil Oil New Zealand Limited has more than 150 locations across the country, some of which are franchisee-owned. It also operates six storage locations across the country and maintains a reputation as a dominant petroleum company in New Zealand.
Mobil New Zealand has 167 stations as of 2022, including 68 in Auckland. Its stations included 121 company-owned and 46 franchisee-owned outlets.

=== Mobil in Japan ===

Since the 1960s, Esso and Mobil stations in Japan had been run by Tōnen General Sekiyu, which had a controlling stake owned by ExxonMobil. In 2012, the company bought out much of ExxonMobil&#x27;s stake, reducing it to a 22% minority. In 2016, ExxonMobil sold the remainder of its stake.

In 2017, the company announced that it would merge with JX Group to form JXTG Holdings, with its petroleum business operating as JXTG Nippon Oil &amp; Energy. Following the merger, it was announced that both the Esso and Mobil brands would be phased out by 2020, and replaced by the Eneos EneJet banner.

=== Mobil in Canada ===

In April 2017, Loblaw Companies sold its network of 213 gas stations (all of which are attached to its various grocery store locations with the exception of its McKercher Drive and Edinburgh Place location off 8th Street East in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, which the pumps at that one is operated by a 7-Eleven location that was converted to Mobil in the summer of 2023) to Brookfield Business Partners. Brookfield (operating as BG Fuels) announced that it would license the Mobil brand from ExxonMobil for use on these locations, making them a sister to Imperial Oil&#x27;s network of Esso-branded gas stations in Canada. As part of the sale agreement, the Mobil stations continue to offer Loblaw&#x27;s PC Optimum rewards program (which Esso also joined the following year).

BG Fuels stated that it would open further Mobil stations beyond the Loblaw properties. BG Fuels later merged with Greenergy, and adopted the new brand Waypoint for convenience stores associated with its fuel properties.

=== Mobil Egypt ===
In Egypt, ExxonMobil&#x27;s operations started in 1902, it is known for providing lubricants and fuels as well as convenience products. It offers more than 350 service stations, more than 40 Mobil 1 centers and a variety of industrial products, lubrication programs and services. Some stations in Cairo, Alexandria and Giza feature On the Run convenience stores.

=== Mobil Portugal ===
Vacuum Oil Company started its operations in Portugal in 1896. In 1941, it became the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company and in 1952, it was renamed Socony Vacuum Portuguesa. In 1955, it became the Mobil Oil Portuguesa. Vacuum Oil was involved in the support of the first auto sports events in Portugal, as well as being responsible for the edition of first road maps and auto drivers guides in the country. Between 1920 and 1928, Vacuum Oil had an important role in the traffic signage of the roads of Portugal, installing thousands of road signs which included the identification of their sponsor, making the company known throughout the country. Along its history, Mobil was pioneer in a number of aspect of the oil business in the country, including the introduction of the first metering pumps, the first network of self-service filling stations and the first motorway service area. The Mobil brand disappeared from the Portuguese service stations in 1996, in the scope of the European joint-venture with BP. In 2000, at the time being the oldest oil company operating in Portugal, Mobil Oil Portuguesa was acquired by BP and disbanded.

<doc id="20709" wikidata="Q130812" url="?curid=20709" title="Mary II">
<text>Mary II (30 April 1662 – 28 December 1694) was Queen of England, Scotland, and Ireland with her husband, King William III and II, from 1689 until her death in 1694. She was also Princess of Orange following her marriage on 4 November 1677. Her joint reign with William over Britain is known as that of William and Mary. 

Mary was born during the reign of her uncle King Charles II. She was the eldest daughter of James, Duke of York (the future James II of England), and his first wife, Anne Hyde. Mary and her sister Anne were raised as Anglicans at the behest of Charles II, although their parents both converted to Roman Catholicism. Charles lacked legitimate children, making Mary second in the line of succession. At the age of 15, she married her cousin William of Orange, a Protestant. Charles died in 1685 and James became king, making Mary heir presumptive. James&#x27;s attempts at rule by decree and the birth of his son from a second marriage, James Francis Edward (later known as &quot;the Old Pretender&quot;), led to his deposition in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the adoption of the English Bill of Rights.

William and Mary became king and queen regnant. Mary mostly deferred to her husband – a renowned military leader and principal opponent of Louis XIV – when he was in England. She did, however, act alone when William was engaged in military campaigns abroad, proving herself to be a powerful, firm, and effective ruler. Mary&#x27;s death from smallpox in 1694 at the age of 32 left William as sole ruler until his death in 1702, when he was succeeded by Mary&#x27;s sister, Anne.

== Early life ==
Mary, born at St James&#x27;s Palace in London on 30 April 1662, was the eldest daughter of James, Duke of York (the future King James II &amp; VII), and his first wife, Anne Hyde. Mary&#x27;s uncle was Charles II, who ruled the three kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland; her maternal grandfather, Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, served for a lengthy period as Charles&#x27;s chief advisor. She was baptised into the Anglican faith in the Chapel Royal at St James&#x27;s, and was named after her ancestor Mary, Queen of Scots. Her godparents included her father&#x27;s cousin Prince Rupert of the Rhine. Although her mother bore eight children, all except Mary and her younger sister Anne died very young, and Charles II had no legitimate children. Consequently, for most of her childhood, Mary was second in line to the throne after her father.

The Duke of York converted to Roman Catholicism in 1668 or 1669 and the Duchess about eight years earlier, but Mary and Anne were brought up as Anglicans, pursuant to the command of Charles II. They were moved to their own establishment at Richmond Palace, where they were raised by their governess Lady Frances Villiers, with only occasional visits to see their parents at St James&#x27;s or their grandfather Lord Clarendon at Twickenham. Mary&#x27;s education, from private tutors, was largely restricted to music, dance, drawing, French, and religious instruction. Her mother died in 1671, and her father remarried in 1673, taking as his second wife Mary of Modena, a Catholic who was only four years older than Mary.

From about the age of nine until her marriage, Mary wrote passionate letters to an older girl, Frances Apsley, the daughter of courtier Sir Allen Apsley. Mary signed herself &#x27;Mary Clorine&#x27;; Apsley was &#x27;Aurelia&#x27;. In time, Frances Apsley became uncomfortable with the correspondence, and replied more formally. 

At the age of 15, Mary became betrothed to her cousin, the Protestant Stadtholder of Holland, William III of Orange. William was the son of Charles II&#x27;s late sister Mary, Princess Royal, and thus fourth in the line of succession after James, Mary, and Anne. At first, Charles opposed the alliance with the Dutch ruler—he preferred that Mary wed the heir to the French throne, the Dauphin Louis, thus allying his realms with Catholic France and strengthening the odds of an eventual Catholic successor in Britain—but later, under pressure from Parliament and with a coalition with the Catholic French no longer politically favourable, he approved the proposed union. The Duke of York agreed to the marriage, after pressure from chief minister Lord Danby and the King, who incorrectly assumed that it would improve James&#x27;s popularity among Protestants. When James told Mary that she was to marry her cousin, &quot;she wept all that afternoon and all the following day&quot;.

==Marriage==

William and a tearful Mary were married in St James&#x27;s Palace by Bishop Henry Compton on 4 November 1677. The bedding ceremony to publicly establish the consummation of the marriage was attended by the royal family, with her uncle the King himself drawing the bedcurtains. Mary accompanied her husband on a rough sea crossing to the Netherlands later that month, after a delay of two weeks caused by bad weather. Rotterdam was inaccessible because of ice, and they were forced to land at the small village of Ter Heijde, and walk through the frosty countryside until met by coaches to take them to Huis Honselaarsdijk. On 14 December, they made a formal entry to The Hague in a grand procession.

Mary&#x27;s animated and personable nature made her popular with the Dutch people, and her marriage to a Protestant prince was popular in Britain. She was devoted to her husband, but he was often away on campaigns, which led to Mary&#x27;s family supposing him to be cold and neglectful. Within months of the marriage Mary was pregnant; however, on a visit to her husband at the fortified city of Breda, she suffered a miscarriage, which may have permanently impaired her ability to have children. Further bouts of illness, which may also have been miscarriages, occurred in mid-1678, early 1679, and early 1680. Her childlessness would be the greatest source of unhappiness in her life.

From May 1684, Charles II&#x27;s illegitimate son, James Scott, Duke of Monmouth, lived in the Netherlands, where he was hosted by William and Mary. Monmouth was viewed as a rival to the Duke of York, and as a potential Protestant heir who could supplant the Duke in the line of succession. William, however, did not consider him a viable alternative and correctly assumed that Monmouth had insufficient support.

While the pair started out somewhat distant, they became quite close and trusting of each other over the course of their marriage. Their mutual fervour for Protestantism additionally helped bind them together.

==James&#x27;s reign==

Upon the death of Charles II without legitimate issue in February 1685, the Duke of York became king as James II in England and Ireland and James VII in Scotland. Mary was playing cards when her husband informed her of her father&#x27;s accession, with the knowledge that she was heir presumptive.

When Charles&#x27;s illegitimate son the Duke of Monmouth assembled an invasion force at Amsterdam, and sailed for Britain, William informed James of the Duke&#x27;s departure, and ordered English regiments in the Low Countries to return to Britain. To William&#x27;s relief, Monmouth was defeated, captured and executed, but both he and Mary were dismayed by James&#x27;s subsequent actions.

James had a controversial religious policy; his attempt to grant freedom of religion to non-Anglicans by suspending acts of Parliament by royal decree was not well received. Mary considered such action illegal, and her chaplain expressed this view in a letter to the archbishop of Canterbury, William Sancroft, on her behalf. She was further dismayed when James refused to help when the Catholic king of France, Louis XIV, invaded Orange and persecuted Huguenot refugees there. In an attempt to damage William, James encouraged his daughter&#x27;s staff to inform her that William was having an affair with Elizabeth Villiers, the daughter of her childhood governess Frances Villiers. Acting on the information, Mary waited outside Villiers&#x27;s room and caught her husband leaving it late at night. William denied adultery, and Mary apparently believed and forgave him. Possibly, Villiers and William were not meeting as lovers but to exchange diplomatic intelligence. Mary&#x27;s staff was dismissed and sent back to Britain.

== Glorious Revolution ==
Disgruntled Protestant politicians and noblemen were in contact with Mary&#x27;s husband as early as 1686. After James took the step of forcing Anglican clergymen to read the Declaration of Indulgence—the proclamation granting religious liberty to Catholics and dissenters—from their churches in May 1688, his popularity plunged further. Alarm amongst Protestants increased when his wife, Mary of Modena, gave birth to a son—James Francis Edward—in June 1688, for the son would, unlike Mary and Anne, be raised a Roman Catholic. Some charged that the boy was supposititious, having been secretly smuggled into the Queen&#x27;s room in a bed-warming pan as a substitute for her stillborn baby. Others thought the father was someone other than James, who was rumoured to be impotent. Seeking information, Mary sent a pointed list of questions to her sister, Anne, regarding the circumstances of the birth. Anne&#x27;s reply, and continued gossip, seemed to confirm Mary&#x27;s suspicions that the child was not her natural brother, and that her father was conspiring to secure a Catholic succession.

On 30 June, seven notable English nobles, later called &quot;the Immortal Seven&quot; secretly invited William—then in the Dutch Republic with Mary—to come to England with an army to depose James. William may have been jealous of his wife&#x27;s position as the heiress to the English Crown, but according to Gilbert Burnet, Mary convinced her husband that she did not care for political power, and told him &quot;she would be no more but his wife, and that she would do all that lay in her power to make him king for life&quot;. She would, she assured him, always obey her husband as she had promised to do in her marriage vows.

William agreed to invade and issued a declaration which referred to James&#x27;s newborn son as the &quot;pretended Prince of Wales&quot;. He also gave a list of grievances of the English people and stated that his proposed expedition was for the sole purpose of having &quot;a free and lawful Parliament assembled&quot;. Having been turned back by storms in October, William and the Dutch army finally landed in England on 5 November 1688, without Mary, who stayed behind in the Netherlands. The disaffected English Army and Navy went over to William, and on 11 December the defeated King James attempted to flee, but was intercepted. A second attempt at flight, on 23 December, was successful; William deliberately allowed James to escape to France, where he lived in exile until his death.

Mary was upset by the circumstances surrounding the deposition of her father, and was torn between concern for him and duty to her husband, but was convinced that her husband&#x27;s actions, however unpleasant, were necessary to &quot;save the Church and State&quot;. When Mary travelled to England after the New Year, she wrote of her &quot;secret joy&quot; at returning to her homeland, &quot;but that was soon checked with the consideration of my father&#x27;s misfortunes&quot;. William ordered her to appear cheerful on their triumphant arrival in London. As a result, she was criticised by Sarah Churchill among others, for appearing cold to her father&#x27;s plight.

In January 1689, a Convention Parliament of England summoned by the Prince of Orange assembled, and much discussion relating to the appropriate course of action ensued. A party led by Lord Danby held that Mary should be sole monarch, as the rightful hereditary heir, while William and his supporters were adamant that a husband could not be subject to his wife. William wished to reign as a king, rather than function as a mere consort of a queen. For her part, Mary did not wish to be queen regnant, believing that women should defer to their husbands, and &quot;knowing my heart is not made for a kingdom and my inclination leads me to a retired quiet life&quot;.

On 13 February 1689, the English Parliament passed the Declaration of Right, in which it deemed that James, by attempting to flee on 11 December 1688, had abdicated the government of the realm, and that the Throne had thereby become vacant. Parliament offered the Crown not to James&#x27;s son, who would have been the heir apparent under normal circumstances, but to William and Mary as joint sovereigns. The only precedent for a joint monarchy dated from the sixteenth century: when Queen Mary I married Philip of Spain, it was agreed that the latter would take the title of king, but only during his wife&#x27;s lifetime, and restrictions were placed on his power. William, however, would be king even after his wife&#x27;s death, and &quot;the sole and full exercise of the regal power [would be] executed by the said Prince of Orange in the names of the said Prince and Princess during their joint lives.&quot; The declaration was later extended to exclude not only James and his heirs (other than Anne) from the throne, but all Catholics, since &quot;it hath been found by experience that it is inconsistent with the safety and welfare of this Protestant kingdom to be governed by a papist prince&quot;.

The bishop of London, Henry Compton (one of the &quot;Immortal Seven&quot;), crowned William and Mary together at Westminster Abbey on 11 April 1689. Normally, the archbishop of Canterbury performs coronations, but the incumbent archbishop, William Sancroft, although an Anglican, refused to recognise the validity of James II&#x27;s removal. Neither William nor Mary enjoyed the ceremony; she thought it &quot;all vanity&quot; and William called it &quot;Popish&quot;. 

On the same day, the Convention of the Estates of Scotland—which was much more divided than the English Parliament—finally declared that James was no longer King of Scotland, that &quot;no Papist can be King or Queen of this Realm&quot;, that William and Mary would be joint sovereigns, and that William would exercise sole and full power. The following day, they were proclaimed king and queen in Edinburgh. They took the Scottish coronation oath in London on 11 May.
Even after the declaration, there was still substantial support for James from the Nonjuring schism in all three kingdoms, particularly in parts of Scotland. Viscount Dundee raised an army in the Scottish Highlands and won a convincing victory at Killiecrankie on 27 July. The huge losses suffered by Dundee&#x27;s troops, however, coupled with his fatal wounding, served to remove the only effective resistance to William and the uprising was quickly crushed, suffering a resounding defeat by Scottish Covenanters the next month at the Battle of Dunkeld.

== Reign ==

In December 1689, Parliament passed the Bill of Rights. This measure—which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right—established restrictions on the royal prerogative; it declared, among other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive bail, or inflict cruel or unusual punishments. The Bill of Rights also confirmed the succession to the throne. Following the death of either William III or Mary II, the other was to continue to reign. Next in the line of succession would be any children of the couple, to be followed by Mary&#x27;s sister Anne and her children. Last in the line of succession stood any children William III might have had from any subsequent marriage.

From 1690 onwards, William was often absent from England on campaign, each year generally from the spring until the autumn. In 1690, he fought Jacobites (who supported James) in Ireland. William had crushed the Irish Jacobites by 1692, but he continued with campaigns abroad to wage war against France in the Netherlands. Whilst her husband was away, Mary administered the government of the realm with the advice of a nine-member Cabinet Council. She was not keen to assume power and felt &quot;deprived of all that was dear to me in the person of my husband, left among those that were perfect strangers to me: my sister of a humour so reserved that I could have little comfort from her.&quot; Anne had quarrelled with William and Mary over money, and the relationship between the two sisters had soured.
When her husband was away, Mary acted on her own if his advice was not available; whilst he was in England, Mary completely refrained from interfering in political matters, as had been agreed in the Declaration and Bill of Rights, and as she preferred. However, she proved a firm ruler, ordering the arrest of her own uncle, Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon, for plotting to restore James II to the throne. In January 1692, the influential John Churchill, 1st Earl of Marlborough, was dismissed on similar charges; the dismissal somewhat diminished her popularity and further harmed her relationship with her sister Anne (who was strongly influenced by Churchill&#x27;s wife, Sarah). Anne appeared at court with Sarah, obviously supporting the disgraced Churchill, which led to Mary angrily demanding that Anne dismiss Sarah and vacate her lodgings.

Mary fell ill with a fever in April 1692, and missed Sunday church service for the first time in 12 years. She also failed to visit Anne, who was suffering a difficult labour. After Mary&#x27;s recovery and the death of Anne&#x27;s baby soon after it was born, Mary did visit her sister, but chose the opportunity to berate Anne for her friendship with Sarah. The sisters never saw each other again. Marlborough was arrested and imprisoned, but then released after his accuser was revealed to be an impostor. Mary recorded in her journal that the breach between the sisters was a punishment from God for the &quot;irregularity&quot; of the Revolution. She was extremely devout, and attended prayers at least twice a day.

Many of Mary&#x27;s proclamations focus on combating licentiousness, insobriety and vice. She often participated in the affairs of the Church—all matters of ecclesiastical patronage passed through her hands. On the death of Archbishop of Canterbury John Tillotson in December 1694, Mary was keen to appoint Bishop of Worcester Edward Stillingfleet to the vacancy, but William overruled her and the post went to Bishop of Lincoln Thomas Tenison.

=== Death ===
Mary was tall (5 foot 11 inches; 180 cm) and apparently fit; she regularly walked between her palaces at Whitehall and Kensington, and it appeared likely she would outlive her husband and sister, both of whom suffered from ill-health. In late 1694, however, she contracted smallpox. She sent away anyone who had not previously had the disease, to prevent the spread of infection. Anne, who was once again pregnant, sent Mary a letter saying she would run any risk to see her sister again, but the offer was declined by Mary&#x27;s groom of the stool, the Countess of Derby. Several days into the course of her illness, the smallpox lesions reportedly disappeared, leaving her skin smooth and unmarked, and Mary said that she felt improved. Her attendants initially hoped she had been ill with measles rather than smallpox, and that she was recovering. But the rash had &quot;turned inward&quot;, a sign that Mary was suffering from a usually fatal form of smallpox, and her condition quickly deteriorated. Mary died at Kensington Palace shortly after midnight on the morning of 28 December, at the age of 32.

William, who had grown increasingly to rely on Mary, was devastated by her death, and told Burnet that &quot;from being the happiest&quot; he was &quot;now going to be the miserablest creature on earth&quot;. While the Jacobites considered her death divine retribution for breaking the fifth commandment (&quot;honour thy father&quot;), she was widely mourned in Britain. During a cold winter, in which the Thames froze, her embalmed body lay in state in Banqueting House, Whitehall. On 5 March, she was buried at Westminster Abbey. Her funeral service was the first of any royal attended by all the members of both Houses of Parliament. For the ceremony, composer Henry Purcell wrote &quot;Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Mary endowed the College of William and Mary (in the present day Williamsburg, Virginia) in 1693, supported Thomas Bray, who founded the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, and was instrumental in the foundation of the Royal Hospital for Seamen, Greenwich, after the Anglo-Dutch victory at the Battle of La Hougue. She is credited with influencing garden design at Het Loo and Hampton Court Palaces, and with popularising blue and white porcelain and the keeping of goldfish as pets.

Mary was depicted by Jacobites as an unfaithful daughter who destroyed her father for her own and her husband&#x27;s gain. In the early years of their reign, she was often seen as completely under the spell of her husband, but after she had temporarily governed alone during his absences abroad, she was portrayed as capable and confident. Nahum Tate&#x27;s &quot;A Present for the Ladies&quot; (1692) compared her to Queen Elizabeth I. Her modesty and diffidence were praised in works such as &quot;A Dialogue Concerning Women&quot; (1691) by William Walsh, which compared her to Cincinnatus, the Roman general who took on a great task when called to do so, but then willingly abandoned power.

A week before her death, Mary went through her papers, weeding out some, which were burnt, but her journal survives, as do her letters to William and to Frances Apsley. The Jacobites lambasted her, but the assessment of her character that came down to posterity was largely the vision of Mary as a dutiful, submissive wife, who assumed power reluctantly, exercised it with considerable ability when necessary, and willingly deferred it to her husband.

<text>Mary I (18 February 1516 – 17 November 1558), also known as Mary Tudor, and as &quot;Bloody Mary&quot; by her Protestant opponents, was Queen of England and Ireland from July 1553 and Queen of Spain as the wife of King Philip II from January 1556 until her death in 1558. She made vigorous attempts to reverse the English Reformation, which had begun during the reign of her father, King Henry VIII. Her attempt to restore to the Church the property confiscated in the previous two reigns was largely thwarted by Parliament, but during her five-year reign, Mary had over 280 religious dissenters burned at the stake in the Marian persecutions.

Mary was the only surviving child of Henry VIII by his first wife, Catherine of Aragon. She was declared illegitimate and barred from the line of succession following the annulment of her parents&#x27; marriage in 1533, though she would later be restored via the Third Succession Act 1543. Her younger half-brother, Edward VI, succeeded their father in 1547 at the age of nine. When Edward became terminally ill in 1553, he attempted to remove Mary from the line of succession because he supposed, correctly, that she would reverse the Protestant reforms that had taken place during his reign. Upon his death, leading politicians proclaimed Mary&#x27;s and Edward&#x27;s Protestant cousin, Lady Jane Grey, as queen instead. Mary speedily assembled a force in East Anglia and deposed Jane, who was eventually beheaded. Mary was—excluding the disputed reigns of Jane and the Empress Matilda—the first queen regnant of England. In July 1554, she married Prince Philip of Spain, becoming queen consort of Habsburg Spain on his accession in 1556.

After Mary&#x27;s death in 1558, her re-establishment of Roman Catholicism in England was reversed by her younger half-sister and successor, Elizabeth I.

==Birth and family==
Mary was born on 18 February 1516 at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich, England. She was the only child of King Henry VIII and his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, to survive infancy. Before Mary, her mother had three miscarriages and stillbirths and one short-lived son, Henry, Duke of Cornwall. 

Mary was baptised into the Catholic faith at the Church of the Observant Friars in Greenwich three days after her birth. Her godparents included Lord Chancellor Thomas Wolsey; her great-aunt Catherine, Countess of Devon; and Agnes Howard, Duchess of Norfolk. Henry VIII&#x27;s first cousin once removed, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, stood sponsor for Mary&#x27;s confirmation, which was conducted immediately after the baptism. The following year, Mary became a godmother herself when she was named as one of the sponsors of her cousin Frances Brandon. In 1520, the Countess of Salisbury was appointed Mary&#x27;s governess. Sir John Hussey (later Lord Hussey) was her chamberlain from 1530, and his wife Lady Anne, daughter of George Grey, 2nd Earl of Kent, was one of Mary&#x27;s attendants.

==Childhood==

Mary was a precocious child. In July 1520, when scarcely four and a half years old, she entertained a visiting French delegation with a performance on the virginals (a type of harpsichord). A great part of her early education came from her mother, who consulted the Spanish humanist Juan Luis Vives for advice and commissioned him to write &quot;De Institutione Feminae Christianae&quot;, a treatise on the education of girls. By the age of nine, Mary could read and write Latin. She studied French, Spanish, music, dance, and perhaps Greek. Henry VIII doted on his daughter and boasted to the Venetian ambassador Sebastian Giustinian that Mary never cried. Mary had a fair complexion with pale blue eyes and red or reddish-golden hair, traits very similar to those of her parents. She was ruddy-cheeked, a trait she inherited from her father.

Despite his affection for Mary, Henry was deeply disappointed that his marriage had produced no sons. By the time Mary was nine years old, it was apparent that Henry and Catherine would have no more children, leaving Henry without a legitimate male heir. In 1525, Henry sent Mary to the border of Wales to preside, presumably in name only, over the Council of Wales and the Marches. She was given her own court based at Ludlow Castle and many of the royal prerogatives normally reserved for a Prince of Wales. Vives and others called her the Princess of Wales, although she was never technically invested with the title. She appears to have spent three years in the Welsh Marches, making regular visits to her father&#x27;s court, before returning permanently to the home counties around London in mid-1528.
Throughout Mary&#x27;s childhood, Henry negotiated potential future marriages for her. When she was only two years old, Mary was promised to Francis, Dauphin of France, the infant son of King Francis I, but the contract was repudiated after three years. In 1522, at the age of six, she was instead contracted to marry her 22-year-old cousin Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. However, Charles broke off the engagement within a few years with Henry&#x27;s agreement. Cardinal Wolsey, Henry&#x27;s chief adviser, then resumed marriage negotiations with the French, and Henry suggested that Mary marry the French king Francis I, who was eager for an alliance with England. A marriage treaty was signed which provided that Mary marry either Francis I or his second son Henry, Duke of Orléans, but Wolsey secured an alliance with France without the marriage.

In 1528, Wolsey&#x27;s agent Thomas Magnus discussed the idea of Mary marrying her cousin James V of Scotland with the Scottish diplomat Adam Otterburn. According to the Venetian Mario Savorgnano, by this time she was developing into a pretty, well-proportioned young lady with a fine complexion.

==Adolescence==
Although various possibilities for Mary&#x27;s marriage had been considered, the marriage of Mary&#x27;s parents was itself in jeopardy, which threatened her status. Disappointed at the lack of a male heir, and eager to remarry, Henry attempted to have his marriage to Catherine annulled, but Pope Clement VII refused his request. Henry claimed, citing biblical passages (Leviticus 20:21), that the marriage was unclean because Catherine was the widow of his brother Arthur, Prince of Wales (Mary&#x27;s uncle). Catherine claimed that her marriage to Arthur was never consummated and so was not a valid marriage. Pope Julius II had issued a dispensation on that basis. Clement VII may have been reluctant to act because he was influenced by Charles V, Catherine&#x27;s nephew and Mary&#x27;s former betrothed, whose troops had sacked Rome in the War of the League of Cognac.

From 1531, Mary was often sick with irregular menstruation and depression, although it is not clear whether this was caused by stress, puberty or a more deep-seated disease. She was not permitted to see her mother, whom Henry had sent to live away from court. In early 1533, Henry married Anne Boleyn, and in May Thomas Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury, formally declared the marriage with Catherine void and the marriage to Anne valid. Henry repudiated the Pope&#x27;s authority, declaring himself Supreme Head of the Church of England. Catherine was demoted to Dowager Princess of Wales (a title she would have held as Arthur&#x27;s widow), and Mary was deemed illegitimate. She was styled &quot;The Lady Mary&quot; rather than Princess, and her place in the line of succession was transferred to Henry and Anne&#x27;s newborn daughter, Elizabeth. Mary&#x27;s household was dissolved; her servants (including the Countess of Salisbury) were dismissed and, in December 1533, she was sent to join her infant half-sister&#x27;s household at Hatfield Palace, Hertfordshire.

Mary determinedly refused to acknowledge that Anne was the queen or that Elizabeth was a princess, enraging King Henry. Under strain and with her movements restricted, Mary was frequently ill, which the royal physician attributed to her &quot;ill treatment&quot;. The Imperial ambassador Eustace Chapuys became her close adviser, and interceded, unsuccessfully, on her behalf at court. The relationship between Mary and her father worsened; they did not speak to each other for three years. Although both she and her mother were ill, Mary was refused permission to visit Catherine. When Catherine died in 1536, Mary was &quot;inconsolable&quot;. Catherine was interred in Peterborough Cathedral, while Mary grieved in semi-seclusion at Hunsdon in Hertfordshire.

==Adulthood==
In 1536, Queen Anne fell from the King&#x27;s favour and was beheaded. Elizabeth, like Mary, was declared illegitimate and stripped of her succession rights. Within two weeks of Anne&#x27;s execution, Henry married Jane Seymour, who urged her husband to make peace with Mary. Henry insisted that Mary recognise him as head of the Church of England, repudiate papal authority, acknowledge that the marriage between her parents was unlawful, and accept her own illegitimacy. She attempted to reconcile with Henry by submitting to his authority as far as &quot;God and my conscience&quot; permitted, but was eventually bullied into signing a document agreeing to all of Henry&#x27;s demands. 

Reconciled with her father, Mary resumed her place at court. Henry granted her a household, which included the reinstatement of Mary&#x27;s favourite, Susan Clarencieux. Mary&#x27;s Privy Purse accounts for this period, kept by Mary Finch, show that Hatfield House, the Palace of Beaulieu (also called Newhall), Richmond and Hunsdon were among her principal places of residence, as well as Henry&#x27;s palaces at Greenwich, Westminster and Hampton Court. Her expenses included fine clothes and gambling at cards, one of her favourite pastimes. 

Rebels in the North of England, including Lord Hussey, Mary&#x27;s former chamberlain, campaigned against Henry&#x27;s religious reforms, and one of their demands was that Mary be made legitimate. The rebellion, known as the Pilgrimage of Grace, was ruthlessly suppressed. Along with other rebels, Hussey was executed, but there is no suggestion that Mary was directly involved. In 1537, Queen Jane died after giving birth to a son, Edward. Mary was made godmother to her half-brother and acted as chief mourner at the Queen&#x27;s funeral.

Mary was courted by Philip, Duke of Bavaria, from late 1539, but he was Lutheran and his suit for her hand was unsuccessful. Over 1539, the King&#x27;s chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, negotiated a potential alliance with the Duchy of Cleves. Suggestions that Mary marry William I, Duke of Cleves, who was the same age, came to nothing, but a match between Henry and the Duke&#x27;s sister Anne was agreed. When the King saw Anne for the first time in late December 1539, a week before the scheduled wedding, he found her unattractive but was unable, for diplomatic reasons and without a suitable pretext, to cancel the marriage. Cromwell fell from favour and was arrested for treason in June 1540; one of the unlikely charges against him was that he had plotted to marry Mary himself. Anne consented to the annulment of the marriage, which had not been consummated, and Cromwell was beheaded.

In 1541, Henry had the Countess of Salisbury, Mary&#x27;s old governess and godmother, executed on the pretext of a Catholic plot in which her son Reginald Pole was implicated. Her executioner was &quot;a wretched and blundering youth&quot; who &quot;literally hacked her head and shoulders to pieces&quot;. In 1542, following the execution of Henry&#x27;s fifth wife, Catherine Howard, the unmarried Henry invited Mary to attend the royal Christmas festivities. At court, while her father was between marriages and thus without a consort, Mary acted as hostess. In 1543, Henry married his sixth and last wife, Catherine Parr, who was able to bring the family closer together. Henry returned Mary and Elizabeth to the line of succession through the Act of Succession 1544 (also known as the Third Succession Act), placing them after Edwardthough both remained legally illegitimate.

Henry VIII died in 1547, and Edward succeeded him. Mary inherited estates in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex, and was granted Hunsdon and Beaulieu as her own. Since Edward was still a child, rule passed to a regency council dominated by Protestants, who attempted to establish their faith throughout the country. For example, the Act of Uniformity 1549 prescribed Protestant rites for church services, such as the use of Thomas Cranmer&#x27;s &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. Mary remained faithful to Roman Catholicism and defiantly celebrated traditional Mass in her own chapel. She appealed to her cousin Emperor Charles V to apply diplomatic pressure demanding that she be allowed to practise her religion.

For most of Edward&#x27;s reign, Mary remained on her own estates and rarely attended court. A plan between May and July 1550 to smuggle her out of England to the safety of the European mainland came to nothing. Religious differences between Mary and Edward continued. Mary attended a reunion with Edward and Elizabeth for Christmas 1550, where the 13-year-old Edward embarrassed Mary, then 34, and reduced both her and himself to tears in front of the court, by publicly reproving her for ignoring his laws regarding worship. Mary repeatedly refused Edward&#x27;s demands that she abandon Catholicism, and Edward persistently refused to drop his demands.

==Accession==
On 6 July 1553, at the age of 15, Edward VI died of a lung infection, possibly tuberculosis. He did not want the crown to go to Mary because he feared she would restore Catholicism and undo his and their father&#x27;s reforms, and so he planned to exclude her from the line of succession. His advisers told him that he could not disinherit only one of his half-sisters: he would have to disinherit Elizabeth as well, even though she was a Protestant. Guided by John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and perhaps others, Edward excluded both from the line of succession in his will.

Contradicting the Act of Succession 1544, which restored Mary and Elizabeth to the line of succession, Edward named Northumberland&#x27;s daughter-in-law Lady Jane Grey, the granddaughter of Henry VIII&#x27;s younger sister Mary, as his successor. Lady Jane&#x27;s mother was Frances Brandon, Mary&#x27;s cousin and goddaughter. Just before Edward&#x27;s death, Mary was summoned to London to visit her dying brother, but was warned that the summons was a pretext on which to capture her and thereby facilitate Jane&#x27;s accession to the throne. Therefore, instead of heading to London from her residence at Hunsdon, Mary fled to East Anglia, where she owned extensive estates and Northumberland had ruthlessly put down Kett&#x27;s Rebellion. Many adherents to the Catholic faith, opponents of Northumberland, lived there. On 9 July, from Kenninghall, Norfolk, she wrote to the privy council with orders for her proclamation as Edward&#x27;s successor.

On 10 July 1553, Lady Jane was proclaimed queen by Northumberland and his supporters, and on the same day Mary&#x27;s servant, Thomas Hungate, arrived in London with her letter to the council. By 12 July, Mary and her supporters had assembled a military force at Framlingham Castle, Suffolk. Northumberland&#x27;s support collapsed, and Jane was deposed on 19 July. She and Northumberland were imprisoned in the Tower of London. Mary rode triumphantly into London on 3 August 1553, on a wave of popular support. She was accompanied by her half-sister Elizabeth and a procession of over 800 nobles and gentlemen.

==Reign==
One of Mary&#x27;s first actions as queen was to order the release of the Roman Catholic Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, and Stephen Gardiner from imprisonment in the Tower of London, as well as her kinsman Edward Courtenay. Mary understood that the young Lady Jane was essentially a pawn in Northumberland&#x27;s scheme, and Northumberland was the only conspirator of rank executed for high treason in the immediate aftermath of the attempted coup. Lady Jane and her husband, Lord Guildford Dudley, though found guilty, were kept under guard in the Tower rather than immediately executed, while Lady Jane&#x27;s father, Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, was released. Mary was left in a difficult position, as almost all the Privy Counsellors had been implicated in the plot to put Lady Jane on the throne. She appointed Gardiner to the council and made him both Bishop of Winchester and Lord Chancellor, offices he held until his death in November 1555. Susan Clarencieux became Mistress of the Robes. On 1 October 1553, Gardiner crowned Mary at Westminster Abbey.

===Spanish marriage===
Now aged 37, Mary turned her attention to finding a husband and producing an heir, which would prevent the Protestant Elizabeth (still next in line under the terms of Henry VIII&#x27;s will and the Act of Succession of 1544) from succeeding to the throne. While the English expected her to marry, there was a general consensus that the Queen should not marry a foreigner, since that could lead to the interference of a foreign power in English affairs. On 16 November 1553, a parliamentary delegation went to her and formally requested that she choose an English husband, with its obvious although tacit candidates being her kinsmen Edward Courtenay, recently created Earl of Devon, and the Catholic Cardinal Reginald Pole. But Mary&#x27;s first cousin, Charles V, also king of Spain, saw that an alliance with England would give him supremacy in Europe; he sent his minister to England to propose his only legitimate son, Philip, as a person whom the religious and political interests of the world recommended for Mary. The Spanish prince had been widowed a few years before by the death of his first wife, Maria Manuela of Portugal, mother of his son Carlos and was the heir apparent to vast territories in Continental Europe and the New World. Both Philip and Mary were descendants of John of Gaunt. As part of the marriage negotiations, a portrait of Philip by Titian was sent to Mary in the latter half of 1553.

Mary was convinced that the safety of England required her to form a closer relationship with Charles&#x27;s family, the Habsburgs, and she decided to marry Philip. A marriage treaty was presented to the Privy Council on 7 December 1553, and even though the terms clearly favoured England and included several safeguards, many still thought that England would be drawn into Philip&#x27;s wars and become a mere province of the Habsburg Empire. This was of particular concern to the landed gentry and parliamentary classes, who foresaw having to pay greater taxes to cover the cost of England&#x27;s participation in foreign wars.

Lord Chancellor Gardiner and the English House of Commons unsuccessfully petitioned Mary to consider marrying an Englishman, fearing that England would be relegated to a dependency of the Habsburgs. The marriage was unpopular with the English; Gardiner and his allies opposed it on the basis of patriotism, while Protestants were motivated by a fear that with the restoration of Catholicism and the arrival of the Spanish King, the Inquisition would come to judge Protestant heretics. Many English people knew the stories of the torments and cruelties suffered by the prisoners of the Inquisition, and there were even those &quot;who had suffered from the rack of the inquisitors&quot; themselves.

It was not just the English who were alarmed by the pending marriage of Mary and Philip. France feared an alliance between England and Spain. Antoine de Noailles, the French ambassador to England, &quot;threatened war and began immediate intrigues with any malcontents he could find&quot;. Before Christmas in 1553, anti-Spanish ballads and broadsheets were circulating in the streets of London.

When Mary insisted on marrying Philip, insurrections broke out. Thomas Wyatt the Younger led a force from Kent to depose Mary in favour of Elizabeth, as part of a wider conspiracy now known as Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion, which also involved the Duke of Suffolk, Lady Jane&#x27;s father. Mary declared publicly that she would summon Parliament to discuss the marriage and if Parliament decided that the marriage was not to the kingdom&#x27;s advantage, she would refrain from pursuing it. On reaching London, Wyatt was defeated and captured. Wyatt, the Duke of Suffolk, Lady Jane, and her husband Guildford Dudley were executed. Courtenay, who was implicated in the plot, was imprisoned and then exiled. Elizabeth, though protesting her innocence in the Wyatt affair, was imprisoned in the Tower of London for two months, then put under house arrest at Woodstock Palace.

Mary was—excluding the brief, disputed reigns of the Empress Matilda and Lady Jane Grey—England&#x27;s first queen regnant. Further, under the English common law doctrine of &quot;jure uxoris&quot;, the property and titles belonging to a woman became her husband&#x27;s upon marriage, and it was feared that any man she married would thereby become king of England in fact and name. While Mary&#x27;s grandparents Ferdinand and Isabella had retained sovereignty of their respective realms during their marriage, there was no precedent to follow in England. Under the terms of Queen Mary&#x27;s Marriage Act, Philip was to be styled &quot;King of England&quot;, all official documents (including Acts of Parliament) were to be dated with both their names, and Parliament was to be called under the joint authority of the couple, for Mary&#x27;s lifetime only. England would not be obliged to provide military support to Philip&#x27;s father in any war, and Philip could not act without his wife&#x27;s consent or appoint foreigners to office in England. Philip was unhappy with these conditions but ready to agree for the sake of securing the marriage. He had no amorous feelings for Mary and sought the marriage for its political and strategic gains; his aide Ruy Gómez de Silva wrote to a correspondent in Brussels, &quot;the marriage was concluded for no fleshly consideration, but in order to remedy the disorders of this kingdom and to preserve the Low Countries.&quot; A future child of Mary and Philip would be not only heir to the throne of England but also heir to the Spanish Empire in the event that Philip&#x27;s eldest son, Don Carlos, died without issue.

To elevate his son to Mary&#x27;s rank, Emperor Charles V ceded to Philip the crown of Naples as well as his claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Mary thus became queen of Naples and titular queen of Jerusalem upon marriage. Their wedding at Winchester Cathedral on 25 July 1554 took place just two days after their first meeting. Philip could not speak English, and so they spoke a mixture of Spanish, French, and Latin.

===False pregnancy===

In September 1554, Mary stopped menstruating. She gained weight, and felt nauseated in the mornings. For these reasons, almost the entirety of her court, including her physicians, believed she was pregnant. Parliament passed the Treason Act of 1554 making Philip regent in the event of Mary&#x27;s death in childbirth. In the last week of April 1555, Elizabeth was released from house arrest, and called to court as a witness to the birth, which was expected imminently. According to Giovanni Michieli, the Venetian ambassador, Philip may have planned to marry Elizabeth if Mary died, but in a letter to his brother-in-law Maximilian of Austria, Philip expressed uncertainty as to whether Mary was pregnant. Mary&#x27;s pregnancy had its pros and cons for Elizabeth: if Mary died during childbirth, Elizabeth would become the new queen; however, if her sister gave birth to a healthy baby, Elizabeth&#x27;s chances of becoming queen would recede sharply.

Thanksgiving services in the diocese of London were held at the end of April after false rumours that Mary had given birth to a son spread across Europe. Through May and June, the apparent delay in delivery fed gossip that Mary was not pregnant. Susan Clarencieux revealed her doubts to the French ambassador, Antoine de Noailles. Mary continued to exhibit signs of pregnancy until July 1555, when her abdomen receded. Michieli dismissively ridiculed the pregnancy as more likely to &quot;end in wind rather than anything else&quot;. It was most likely a false pregnancy, perhaps induced by Mary&#x27;s overwhelming desire to have a child. In August, soon after the disgrace of the false pregnancy, which Mary considered &quot;God&#x27;s punishment&quot; for her having &quot;tolerated heretics&quot; in her realm, Philip left England to command his armies against France in Flanders. Mary was heartbroken and fell into a deep depression. Michieli was touched by the Queen&#x27;s grief; he wrote she was &quot;extraordinarily in love&quot; with her husband and disconsolate at his departure.

Elizabeth remained at court until October, apparently restored to favour. In the absence of any children, Philip was concerned that one of the next claimants to the English throne after his sister-in-law was Mary, Queen of Scots, who was betrothed to Francis, Dauphin of France. Philip persuaded his wife that Elizabeth should marry his cousin Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, to secure the Catholic succession and preserve the Habsburg interest in England, but Elizabeth refused to agree and parliamentary consent was unlikely.

===Religious policy===
In the month following her accession, Mary issued a proclamation that she would not compel any of her subjects to follow her religion, but by the end of September 1553, leading Protestant churchmen—including Thomas Cranmer, John Bradford, John Rogers, John Hooper, and Hugh Latimer—were imprisoned. Mary&#x27;s first Parliament, which assembled in early October, declared her parents&#x27; marriage valid and abolished Edward&#x27;s religious laws. Church doctrine was restored to the form it had taken in the 1539 Six Articles of Henry VIII, which (among other things) reaffirmed clerical celibacy. Married priests were deprived of their benefices.

Mary rejected the break with Rome instituted by her father and the establishment of Protestantism by her brother&#x27;s regents. Philip persuaded Parliament to repeal Henry&#x27;s religious laws, returning the English church to Roman jurisdiction. Reaching an agreement took many months and Mary and Pope Julius III had to make a major concession: the confiscated monastery lands were not returned to the church but remained in the hands of their influential new owners. By the end of 1554, the Pope had approved the deal, and the Heresy Acts were revived.

Around 800 rich Protestants, including John Foxe, fled into exile. Those who stayed and persisted in publicly proclaiming their beliefs became targets of heresy laws. The first executions occurred over five days in February 1555: John Rogers on 4 February, Laurence Saunders on 8 February, and Rowland Taylor and John Hooper on 9 February. Thomas Cranmer, the imprisoned archbishop of Canterbury, was forced to watch Bishops Ridley and Latimer being burned at the stake. He recanted, repudiated Protestant theology, and rejoined the Catholic faith. Under the normal process of the law, he should have been absolved as a repentant, but Mary refused to reprieve him. On the day of his burning, he dramatically withdrew his recantation. In total, 283 were executed, most by burning. The burnings proved so unpopular that even Alfonso de Castro, one of Philip&#x27;s own ecclesiastical staff, condemned them and another adviser, Simon Renard, warned him that such &quot;cruel enforcement&quot; could &quot;cause a revolt&quot;. Mary persevered with the policy, which continued for the rest of her reign and exacerbated anti-Catholic and anti-Spanish feeling among the English people. The victims became lauded as martyrs.

Reginald Pole, the son of Mary&#x27;s executed governess, arrived as papal legate in November 1554. He was ordained a priest and appointed Archbishop of Canterbury immediately after Cranmer&#x27;s execution in March 1556.

As long as the Queen remained childless, her half-sister Elizabeth was her successor. Mary, concerned about her sister&#x27;s religious convictions (Elizabeth only attended mass under obligation and had only superficially converted to Catholicism to save her life after being imprisoned following Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion, although she remained a staunch Protestant), seriously considering the possibility of removing her from the succession and naming as her successor her Scottish first cousin and devout Catholic, Margaret Douglas.

===Foreign policy===

Furthering the Tudor conquest of Ireland, English colonists were settled in the Irish Midlands under Mary and Philip&#x27;s reign. Queen&#x27;s and King&#x27;s Counties (later called Counties Laois and Offaly) were founded, and their plantation began. Their principal towns were named, respectively, Maryborough (later called Portlaoise) and Philipstown (later Daingean).

In January 1556, Mary&#x27;s father-in-law the Emperor abdicated. Mary and Philip were still apart; he was declared king of Spain in Brussels, but she stayed in England. Philip negotiated an unsteady truce with the French in February 1556. The next month, the French ambassador in England, Antoine de Noailles, was implicated in a plot against Mary when Henry Dudley, a second cousin of the executed Duke of Northumberland, attempted to assemble an invasion force in France. The plot, known as the Dudley conspiracy, was betrayed, and the conspirators in England were rounded up. Dudley remained in exile in France, and Noailles prudently left Britain.

Philip returned to England from March to July 1557 to persuade Mary to support Spain in a renewed war against France. Mary was in favour of declaring war, but her councillors opposed it because French trade would be jeopardised, it contravened the foreign war provisions of the marriage treaty, and a bad economic legacy from Edward VI&#x27;s reign and a series of poor harvests meant England lacked supplies and finances. War was only declared in June 1557 after Reginald Pole&#x27;s nephew Thomas Stafford invaded England and seized Scarborough Castle with French help, in a failed attempt to depose Mary. As a result of the war, relations between England and the Papacy became strained, since Pope Paul IV was allied with Henry II of France. In August, English forces were victorious in the aftermath of the Battle of Saint Quentin, with one eyewitness reporting, &quot;Both sides fought most choicely, and the English best of all.&quot; Celebrations were brief, as in January 1558 French forces took Calais, England&#x27;s sole remaining possession on the European mainland. Although the territory was financially burdensome, its loss was a mortifying blow to the Queen&#x27;s prestige. According to &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot;, Mary later lamented (although this may be apocryphal), &quot;When I am dead and opened, you shall find &#x27;Calais&#x27; lying in my heart&quot;.

===Commerce and revenue===
The weather during the years of Mary&#x27;s reign was consistently wet. The persistent rain and flooding led to famine. Another problem was the decline of the Antwerp cloth trade. Despite Mary&#x27;s marriage to Philip, England did not benefit from Spain&#x27;s enormously lucrative trade with the New World. The Spanish guarded their trade routes jealously, and Mary could not condone English smuggling or piracy against her husband&#x27;s subjects. In an attempt to increase trade and rescue the English economy, Mary&#x27;s counsellors continued Northumberland&#x27;s policy of seeking out new commercial opportunities. She granted a royal charter to the Muscovy Company under governor Sebastian Cabot, and commissioned a world atlas from Diogo Homem. Adventurers such as John Lok and William Towerson sailed south in an attempt to develop links with the coast of Africa.

Financially, Mary&#x27;s regime tried to reconcile a modern form of government—with correspondingly higher spending—with a medieval system of collecting taxation and dues. Mary retained the Edwardian appointee William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester, as Lord High Treasurer and assigned him to oversee the revenue collection system. A failure to apply new tariffs to new forms of imports meant that a key source of revenue was neglected. To solve this, Mary&#x27;s government published a revised &quot;Book of Rates&quot; (1558), which listed the tariffs and duties for every import. This publication was not extensively reviewed until 1604.

English coinage was debased under both Henry VIII and Edward VI. Mary drafted plans for currency reform but they were not implemented until after her death.

==Death==

After Philip&#x27;s visit in 1557, Mary again thought she was pregnant, with a baby due in March 1558. She decreed in her will that her husband would be the regent during the minority of their child. But no child was born, and Mary was forced to accept that her half-sister Elizabeth would be her lawful successor.

Mary was weak and ill from May 1558. In pain, possibly from ovarian cysts or uterine cancer, she died on 17 November 1558, aged 42, at St James&#x27;s Palace, during an influenza epidemic that also claimed Archbishop Pole&#x27;s life later that day. She was succeeded by Elizabeth. Philip, who was in Brussels, wrote to his sister Joanna: &quot;I felt a reasonable regret for her death.&quot;

Although Mary&#x27;s will stated that she wished to be buried next to her mother, she was interred in Westminster Abbey on 14 December, in a tomb she eventually shared with Elizabeth. The inscription on their tomb, affixed there by James I when he succeeded Elizabeth, is &quot;Regno consortes et urna, hic obdormimus Elizabetha et Maria sorores, in spe resurrectionis&quot; (&quot;Consorts in realm and tomb, we sisters Elizabeth and Mary here lie down to sleep in hope of the resurrection&quot;).

==Legacy==

John White, Bishop of Winchester, praised Mary at her funeral service: &quot;She was a king&#x27;s daughter; she was a king&#x27;s sister; she was a king&#x27;s wife. She was a queen, and by the same title a king also.&quot; She was the first woman to successfully claim the throne of England, despite competing claims and determined opposition, and enjoyed popular support and sympathy during the earliest parts of her reign, especially from the Roman Catholics of England.

Protestant writers at the time, and since, have often condemned Mary&#x27;s reign. By the 17th century, the memory of her religious persecutions had led to the adoption of her sobriquet &quot;Bloody Mary&quot;. John Knox attacked Mary in his &quot;First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women&quot; (1558), and John Foxe vilified her prominently in &quot;Actes and Monuments&quot; (1563). Foxe&#x27;s book remained popular throughout the following centuries and helped shape enduring perceptions of Mary as a bloodthirsty tyrant. Historian Lucy Wooding notes misogynistic undertones in descriptions of Mary. &quot;She&#x27;s simultaneously being lambasted for being &#x27;vindictive and fierce&#x27; and &#x27;spineless and weak&#x27;, criticized for such actions as showing clemency to political prisoners and yielding authority to her husband.&quot;

Mary is remembered in the 21st century for her vigorous efforts to restore the primacy of Roman Catholicism in England after the rise of Protestant influence during the previous reigns. Protestant historians have long deplored her reign, emphasizing that in just five years she burned several hundred Protestants at the stake. In the mid-20th century, H. F. M. Prescott attempted to redress the tradition that Mary was intolerant and authoritarian, and scholarship since then has tended to view the older, simpler assessments of Mary with increasing reservations. A historiographical revisionism since the 1980s has improved her reputation among scholars to some degree. Christopher Haigh argued that her revival of religious festivities and Catholic practices was generally welcomed. Haigh concluded that the &quot;last years of Mary&#x27;s reign were not a gruesome preparation for Protestant victory, but a continuing consolidation of Catholic strength.&quot; English Catholics often remembered Mary favourably; decades after her death, the epitaph for John Throckmorton refers to &quot;Queene Marie [Mary I] of happie memorie&quot;.

Catholic historians, such as John Lingard, thought Mary&#x27;s policies failed not because they were wrong but because she had too short a reign to establish them and because of natural disasters beyond her control. In other countries, the Catholic Counter-Reformation was spearheaded by Jesuit missionaries, but Mary&#x27;s chief religious advisor, Cardinal Reginald Pole, refused to allow the Jesuits into England. Her marriage to Philip was unpopular among her subjects and her religious policies resulted in deep-seated resentment. The military loss of Calais to France was a bitter humiliation to English pride. Failed harvests increased public discontent. Philip spent most of his time abroad, while his wife remained in England, leaving her depressed at his absence and undermined by their inability to have children. After Mary&#x27;s death, Philip sought to marry Elizabeth but she refused him. Although Mary&#x27;s rule was ultimately ineffectual and unpopular, the policies of fiscal reform, naval expansion, and colonial exploration that were later lauded as Elizabethan accomplishments were started in Mary&#x27;s reign.

==Titles, style, and arms==
When Mary ascended the throne, she was proclaimed under the same official style as Henry VIII and Edward VI: &quot;Mary, by the Grace of God, Queen of England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, and of the Church of England and of Ireland on Earth Supreme Head&quot;. The title Supreme Head of the Church was repugnant to Mary&#x27;s Catholicism, and she omitted it after Christmas 1553.

Under Mary&#x27;s marriage treaty with Philip, the official joint style reflected not only Mary&#x27;s but also Philip&#x27;s dominions and claims: &quot;Philip and Mary, by the grace of God, King and Queen of England, France, Naples, Jerusalem, and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, Princes of Spain and Sicily, Archdukes of Austria, Dukes of Milan, Burgundy and Brabant, Counts of Habsburg, Flanders and Tyrol&quot;. This style, which had been in use since 1554, was replaced when Philip inherited the Spanish Crown in 1556 with &quot;Philip and Mary, by the Grace of God King and Queen of England, Spain, France, both the Sicilies, Jerusalem and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, Archdukes of Austria, Dukes of Burgundy, Milan and Brabant, Counts of Habsburg, Flanders and Tyrol&quot;.

Mary I&#x27;s coat of arms was the same as those used by all her predecessors since Henry IV: Quarterly, Azure three fleurs-de-lys Or [for France] and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England). Sometimes, her arms were impaled (depicted side-by-side) with those of her husband. She adopted &quot;Truth, the Daughter of Time&quot; () as her personal motto.

==Family tree==

Both Mary and Philip were descended from John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster, a relationship that was used to portray Philip as an English king.

<doc id="20715" wikidata="Q538242" url="?curid=20715" title="Marbury v. Madison">
<text>Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that established the principle of judicial review, meaning that American courts have the power to strike down laws and statutes they find to violate the Constitution of the United States. Decided in 1803, &quot;Marbury&quot; is regarded as the single most important decision in American constitutional law. It established that the U.S. Constitution is actual law, not just a statement of political principles and ideals. It also helped define the boundary between the constitutionally separate executive and judicial branches of the federal government.

The case originated in early 1801 and stemmed from the rivalry between outgoing President John Adams and incoming President Thomas Jefferson. Adams, a member of the Federalist Party, had lost the U.S. presidential election of 1800 to Jefferson, who led the Democratic-Republican Party. In March 1801, just two days before his term as president ended, Adams appointed several dozen Federalist Party supporters to new circuit judge and justice of the peace positions in an attempt to frustrate Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans. The outgoing U.S. Senate quickly confirmed Adams&#x27;s appointments, but outgoing Secretary of State John Marshall was unable to deliver all of the new judges&#x27; commissions before Adams&#x27;s departure and Jefferson&#x27;s inauguration. Jefferson believed the undelivered commissions were void and instructed his Secretary of State, James Madison, not to deliver them. One of the undelivered commissions belonged to William Marbury, a Maryland businessman who had been a strong supporter of Adams and the Federalists. In late 1801, after Madison had repeatedly refused to deliver his commission, Marbury filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court asking the Court to issue a writ of mandamus forcing Madison to deliver his commission.

In an opinion written by Marshall, who by then had been appointed Chief Justice of the United States, the Supreme Court held that Madison&#x27;s refusal to deliver Marbury&#x27;s commission was illegal. The Court also held that it was normally proper in such situations for a court to order the government official in question to deliver the commission. In Marbury&#x27;s case, however, the Court did not order Madison to comply. Examining the law Congress had passed to define Supreme Court jurisdiction over types of cases like Marbury&#x27;s—Section 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789—the Court found that the Act had expanded the definition of the Supreme Court&#x27;s jurisdiction beyond what was originally set forth in the U.S. Constitution. The Court then struck down Section 13 of the Act, announcing that American courts have the power to invalidate laws that they find to violate the Constitution—a power now known as &quot;judicial review&quot;. Because striking down the law removed any jurisdiction the Court might have had over the case, the Court could not issue the writ that Marbury had requested.

==Background==
In the fiercely contested U.S. presidential election of 1800, the three main candidates were Thomas Jefferson, Aaron Burr, and the incumbent president, John Adams. Adams espoused the pro-business and pro-national-government politics of the Federalist Party and its leader, Alexander Hamilton. Jefferson and Burr were leaders of the opposition Democratic-Republican Party, which favored agriculture and decentralization. American public opinion had gradually turned against the Federalists in the months leading up to the election. The shift was mainly due to the Federalists&#x27; use of the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts, but also due to growing tensions with Great Britain, with whom the Federalists favored close ties. Jefferson easily won the election&#x27;s popular vote but only narrowly defeated Adams in the Electoral College.

After the results of the election became clear, Adams and the Federalists became determined to exercise their remaining influence before Jefferson took office, and they did everything they could to fill federal offices with &quot;anti-Jeffersonians&quot; who were loyal to the Federalists. On March2, 1801, just two days before his presidential term ended, Adams nominated nearly 60 Federalist supporters to new circuit judge and justice of the peace positions the Federalist-controlled Congress had recently created. These last-minute nomineeswhom Jefferson&#x27;s supporters derisively called the &quot;Midnight Judges&quot;included William Marbury, a prosperous businessman from Maryland. An ardent Federalist, Marbury was active in Maryland politics and had been a vigorous supporter of the Adams presidency.

The following day, March 3, the Senate approved Adams&#x27;s nominations &quot;en masse&quot;. The appointees&#x27; commissions were immediately written out on parchment, then signed by Adams and sealed by Secretary of State John Marshall, who had been named the new Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in January but agreed to continue serving as Secretary of State for the remaining weeks of Adams&#x27;s presidency. Marshall then dispatched his younger brother James Markham Marshall to deliver the commissions to the appointees. With only one day left before Jefferson&#x27;s inauguration, James Marshall was able to deliver most of the commissions, but a fewincluding Marbury&#x27;swere not delivered.

The day after, March 4, 1801, Jefferson was sworn in and became the third President of the United States. Jefferson instructed his new Secretary of State, James Madison, to withhold the undelivered commissions. In Jefferson&#x27;s opinion, the commissions were void because they had not been delivered before Adams left office. Without their commissions, the appointees were unable to assume their new offices and duties. Over the next several months, Madison steadfastly refused to deliver Marbury&#x27;s commission to him. Finally, in December 1801, Marbury filed a lawsuit against Madison at the Supreme Court, asking the court to force Madison to deliver his commission. This lawsuit resulted in the case of &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;.

==Decision==
On February 24, 1803, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous 4–0 decision against Marbury. The Court&#x27;s opinion was written by Chief Justice John Marshall, who structured the Court&#x27;s opinion around a series of three questions it answered in turn:
* First, did Marbury have a right to his commission?
* Second, if Marbury had a right to his commission, then was there a legal remedy for him to obtain it?
* Third, if there was such a remedy, then could the Supreme Court legally issue it?

===Marbury&#x27;s right to his commission===
The Court began by holding that Marbury had a legal right to his commission. Marshall reasoned that all appropriate procedures were followed: the commission had been properly signed and sealed. Madison had argued that the commissions were void if not delivered. The Court disagreed, saying that the delivery of the commission was merely a custom, not an essential element of the commission itself.

The Court said that because Marbury&#x27;s commission was valid, Madison&#x27;s withholding it was &quot;violative of a vested legal right&quot; on Marbury&#x27;s part.

===Marbury&#x27;s legal remedy===
Turning to the second question, the Court said that the law provided Marbury a remedy for Madison&#x27;s unlawful withholding of his commission. Marshall wrote that &quot;it is a general and indisputable rule, that where there is a legal right, there is also a legal remedy by suit or action at law, whenever that right is invaded.&quot; This rule derives from the ancient Roman legal maxim (&quot;where there is a legal right, there is a legal remedy&quot;), which was well established in the English common law. In what the American legal scholar Akhil Reed Amar called &quot;one of the most important and inspiring passages&quot; of the opinion, Marshall wrote:

The Court then confirmed that a writ of mandamusa type of court order that commands a government official to perform an act his official duties legally require him to performwas the proper remedy for Marbury&#x27;s situation. But this raised the issue of whether the Court, which was part of the judicial branch of the government, had the power to command Madison, who as secretary of state was part of the executive branch of the government. The Court held that so long as the remedy involved a mandatory duty to a specific person and not a political matter left to discretion, the courts could provide the legal remedy. Borrowing a phrase John Adams had drafted in 1779 for the Massachusetts State Constitution, Marshall wrote: &quot;The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men.&quot;

===The Supreme Court&#x27;s jurisdiction===

This brought the Court to the third question: did the Supreme Court have proper jurisdiction over the case that would allow it to legally issue the writ of mandamus that Marbury wanted? The answer depended entirely on how the Court interpreted the Judiciary Act of 1789. Congress had passed the Judiciary Act to establish the American federal court system. Section 13 of the Judiciary Act sets out the Supreme Court&#x27;s original and appellate jurisdictions.

Marbury had argued that the wording of Section 13 had given the Supreme Court the authority to issue writs of mandamus when hearing cases under exclusive (original) jurisdiction, not only under appellate jurisdiction. As Marshall explains in the opinion, gives a court the power to be the first to hear and decide a case; gives a court the power to hear an appeal from a lower court&#x27;s decision and to &quot;revise and correct&quot; the previous decision. The portion of Section 13 that speaks of the Court&#x27;s power to issue writs of mandamus appears after its sentence on appellate jurisdiction, not with the earlier sentences on original jurisdiction, but a semicolon separates it from the clause on appellate jurisdiction. Section 13 does not make clear whether the mandamus clause was intended to be read as part of the appellate clause or on its own—in the opinion, Marshall quoted only the end of the section—and the wording of the law can plausibly be read either way.

In the end, the Court agreed with Marbury and interpreted Section 13 of the Judiciary Act to have authorized the Court to exercise original jurisdiction over cases involving disputes over writs of mandamus. This interpretation, however, meant that the Judiciary Act conflicted with Article III of the Constitution. Article III defines the Supreme Court&#x27;s jurisdiction as follows:

Article III says that the Supreme Court only has original jurisdiction over cases where a U.S. state is a party to a lawsuit or where a lawsuit involves foreign dignitaries. Neither of these categories covered Marbury&#x27;s lawsuit, which was a dispute over a writ of mandamus for his justice of the peace commission. According to the Constitution, therefore, the Court did not have original jurisdiction over a case like Marbury&#x27;s.

Because the Court had interpreted the Judiciary Act to have given it original jurisdiction over lawsuits for writs of mandamus, this meant the Judiciary Act had taken the Constitution&#x27;s initial scope for the Supreme Court&#x27;s original jurisdiction, which did not cover cases involving writs of mandamus, and expanded it to include them. The Court ruled that Congress cannot increase the Supreme Court&#x27;s original jurisdiction as it was set down in the Constitution, and it therefore held that the relevant portion of Section 13 of the Judiciary Act violated Article III of the Constitution.

===Judicial review and striking down the law===
After ruling that Section 13 of the Judiciary Act conflicted with the Constitution, the Court struck down that section in its first ever declaration of the power of judicial review. The Court ruled that American federal courts have the power to refuse to give any consideration to congressional legislation that is inconsistent with their interpretation of the Constitutiona move colloquially known as &quot;striking down&quot; laws.

The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly give the federal judiciary the power of judicial review. Nevertheless, the Court&#x27;s opinion gives many reasons in support of the judiciary&#x27;s possession of the power. First, Marshall reasoned that the written nature of the Constitution inherently established judicial review. Borrowing from Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s essay &quot;Federalist No. 78&quot;, Marshall wrote:

Second, the Court declared that deciding the constitutionality of the laws it applies is an inherent part of the American judiciary&#x27;s role. In what has become the most famous and most frequently quoted line of the opinion, Marshall wrote:

Marshall reasoned that the Constitution places limits on the American government&#x27;s powers, and that those limits would be meaningless unless they were subject to judicial review and enforcement. He reasoned that the Constitution&#x27;s provisions limiting Congress&#x27;s powersuch as the prohibitions on &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws and bills of attaindermeant that in some cases judges would be forced to choose between enforcing the Constitution or following Congress. Marshall held &quot;virtually as a matter of iron logic&quot; that in the event of conflict between the Constitution and statutory laws passed by Congress, constitutional law must be supreme.

Third, the Court said that denying the supremacy of the Constitution over Congress&#x27;s acts would mean that &quot;courts must close their eyes on the constitution, and see only the law.&quot; This, Marshall wrote, would make Congress omnipotent, because none of the laws it passed would ever be invalid.
Marshall then gave several other reasons in favor of judicial review. He reasoned that the authorization in Article III of the Constitution that the Court can decide cases arising &quot;under this Constitution&quot; implied that the Court had the power to strike down laws conflicting with the Constitution. This, Marshall wrote, meant that the Founders were willing to have the American judiciary use and interpret the Constitution when judging cases. He also said that federal judges&#x27; oaths of office—in which they swear to discharge their duties impartially and &quot;agreeably to the Constitution and laws of the United States&quot;—requires them to support the Constitution. Lastly, Marshall reasoned that judicial review is implied in the Supremacy Clause of Article VI of the U.S. Constitution, because it declares that the supreme law of the United States is the Constitution and laws made &quot;in Pursuance thereof&quot;.

Having given his list of reasons, Marshall concluded the Court&#x27;s opinion by reaffirming the Court&#x27;s ruling on the invalidity of Section 13 of the Judiciary Act and, therefore, the Court&#x27;s inability to issue Marbury&#x27;s writ of mandamus.
==Analysis==
===Political dilemma===
Besides its legal issues, the case of &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; also created a difficult political dilemma for John Marshall and the Supreme Court. If the Court had ruled in Marbury&#x27;s favor and issued a writ of mandamus ordering Madison to deliver Marbury&#x27;s commission, then Jefferson and Madison would probably have simply ignored the writ. This would have made the Court look impotent and emphasized the shakiness of the early American judiciary. On the other hand, a simple ruling against Marbury would have given Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans a clear political victory over the Federalists.

Marshall solved both problems. First, he had the Court rule that Madison&#x27;s withholding of Marbury&#x27;s commission was illegal, which pleased the Federalists. Then, however, he also ruled that the Court could not grant Marbury his requested writ of mandamus, which gave Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans the result they desired. Lastly, in what the American legal scholar Laurence Tribe calls &quot;an oft-told tale ... [that] remains awe-inspiring&quot;, Marshall had the Court rule in a way that maneuvered Marbury&#x27;s simple petition for a writ of mandamus into a case that presented a question that went to the heart of American constitutional law itself. The American political historian Robert G. McCloskey described:

Marshall had been looking for a case suitable for introducing judicial review and was eager to use the situation in &quot;Marbury&quot; to establish his claim. He introduced judicial reviewa move Jefferson decriedbut used it to strike down a provision of a law that he read to have expanded the Supreme Court&#x27;s powers, and thereby produced Jefferson&#x27;s hoped-for result of Marbury losing his case. Marshall &quot;seized the occasion to uphold the institution of judicial review, but he did so in the course of reaching a judgment that his political opponents could neither defy nor protest.&quot; Although Jefferson criticized the Court&#x27;s decision, he accepted it, and Marshall&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Marbury&quot; &quot;articulate[d] a role for the federal courts that survives to this day.&quot; The American legal scholar Erwin Chemerinsky concludes: &quot;The brilliance of Marshall&#x27;s opinion cannot be overstated.&quot;

===Legal criticism===
The Supreme Court&#x27;s historic decision in &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; continues to be the subject of critical analysis and inquiry. In a 1955 &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; article, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter emphasized that one can criticize Marshall&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Marbury&quot; without demeaning it: &quot;The courage of &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; is not minimized by suggesting that its reasoning is not impeccable and its conclusion, however wise, not inevitable.&quot;

Criticisms of Marshall&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Marbury&quot; usually fall into two general categories. First, some criticize the way Marshall &quot;strove&quot; to reach the conclusion that the U.S. Supreme Court has constitutional authority over the other branches of the U.S. government. Today, American courts generally follow the principle of &quot;constitutional avoidance&quot;: if a certain interpretation of a law raises constitutional problems, they prefer to use alternative interpretations that avoid these problems, as long as the alternative interpretations are plausible. In &quot;Marbury&quot;, Marshall could have avoided the constitutional questions through different legal rulings. If the Court had ruled that Marbury did not have a right to his commission until it was delivered, or if he had ruled that refusals to honor political appointments could only be remedied through the political process and not the judicial process, then it would have disposed of the case immediately and the Court would not have reached the case&#x27;s constitutional issues. Marshall did not do so, and many legal scholars have criticized him for it. Some scholars have responded that the &quot;constitutional avoidance&quot; principle did not exist in 1803 and that it is &quot;only a general guide for Court action&quot;, not an &quot;ironclad rule&quot;. Alternatively, it has also been argued that the claim that Marshall &quot;strove&quot; to create a controversy largely vanishes when the case is viewed from the legal perspective of the late 18th century when American colonies&#x27; and states&#x27; supreme courts were largely modeled on England&#x27;s Court of King&#x27;s Bench, which inherently possessed &quot;mandamus&quot; powers.

Second, Marshall&#x27;s arguments for the Court&#x27;s authority are sometimes said to be mere &quot;series of assertions&quot;, rather than substantive reasons logically laid out to support his position. Scholars generally agree that Marshall&#x27;s series of assertions regarding the U.S. Constitution and the actions of the other branches of government do not &quot;inexorably lead to the conclusion that Marshall draws from them.&quot; Marshall&#x27;s assertion of the American judiciary&#x27;s authority to review executive branch actions was the most controversial issue when &quot;Marbury&quot; was first decided, and several subsequent U.S. presidents have tried to dispute it, to varying degrees.

Additionally, it is questionable whether Marshall should have participated in the adjudication of the &quot;Marbury&quot; case, because he had played a role in the underlying dispute. Marshall was still the acting secretary of state when Adams nominated Marbury and the other &quot;Midnight Judges&quot;. He had signed Marbury and the other appointees&#x27; commissions and had been responsible for their delivery. This potential conflict of interest raises strong grounds for Marshall to have recused himself from the case. In hindsight, the fact that Marshall did not recuse himself from &quot;Marbury&quot; is likely indicative of his eagerness to hear the case and use it to establish judicial review.

==Legacy==
&quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; is regarded as the single most important decision in American constitutional law. It established U.S. federal judges&#x27; authority to review the constitutionality of Congress&#x27;s legislative acts, and to this day the Supreme Court&#x27;s power to review the constitutionality of American laws at both the federal and state level &quot;is generally rested upon the epic decision of &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;.&quot;
Although the Court&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Marbury&quot; established the power of judicial review in American federal law, it did not invent or create it. Some 18th-century British jurists had argued that English courts had the power to circumscribe Parliament. The idea became widely accepted in Colonial Americaespecially in Marshall, Jefferson, and Madison&#x27;s native Virginiaunder the theory that in America only the people were sovereign, not the government, and so the courts should only implement legitimate laws. American courts&#x27; &quot;independent power and duty to interpret the law&quot; was well established by the time of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, and Hamilton had defended the concept in &quot;Federalist No. 78&quot;. In addition, the 1796 Supreme Court case &quot;Hylton v. United States&quot; considered whether a tax on carriages was constitutional, though the Court ruled that the statute in question was in fact constitutional and did not actually exercise the power. Nevertheless, Marshall&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Marbury&quot; was the Supreme Court&#x27;s first mention of, and exercise of, that power. It made the practice more routine, rather than exceptional, and prepared the way for the Court&#x27;s opinion in the 1819 case &quot;McCulloch v. Maryland&quot;, in which Marshall implied that the Supreme Court was the supreme interpreter of the U.S. Constitution.

&quot;Marbury&quot; also established that the power of judicial review covers actions by the executive branch—the President and his cabinet members. However, American courts&#x27; power of judicial review over executive branch actions only extends to matters in which the executive has a legal duty to act or refrain from acting, and does not extend to matters that are entirely within the President&#x27;s discretion, such as whether to veto a bill or whom to appoint to an office. This power has been the basis of later important Supreme Court decisions. In its 1974 decision &quot;United States v. Nixon&quot;, for example, the Supreme Court held that President Richard Nixon had to comply with a subpoena to provide tapes of his conversations for use in a criminal trial related to the Watergate scandal, which ultimately led to Nixon&#x27;s resignation.

Although it is a potent check on the other branches of the U.S. government, federal courts rarely exercised the power of judicial review in early American history. After deciding &quot;Marbury&quot; in 1803, the Supreme Court did not strike down another federal law until 1857, when it struck down the Missouri Compromise in its now-infamous decision &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;, a ruling that contributed to the outbreak of the American Civil War.

<doc id="20716" wikidata="Q366198" url="?curid=20716" title="Mellitus">
<text>Mellitus (; died 24 April 624) was the first bishop of London in the Saxon period, the third archbishop of Canterbury, and a member of the Gregorian mission sent to England to convert the Anglo-Saxons from their native paganism to Christianity. He arrived in 601 AD with a group of clergy sent to augment the mission, and was consecrated as Bishop of London in 604. Mellitus was the recipient of a famous letter from Pope Gregory I known as the &quot;Epistola ad Mellitum&quot;, preserved in a later work by the medieval chronicler Bede, which suggested the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons be undertaken gradually, integrating pagan rituals and customs. In 610, Mellitus returned to Italy to attend a council of bishops, and returned to England bearing papal letters to some of the missionaries.

Mellitus was exiled from London by the pagan successors to his patron, King Sæberht of Essex, following the latter&#x27;s death around 616. King Æthelberht of Kent, Mellitus&#x27; other patron, died at about the same time, forcing him to take refuge in Gaul. Mellitus returned to England the following year, after Æthelberht&#x27;s successor had been converted to Christianity, but he was unable to return to London, whose inhabitants remained pagan. Mellitus was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 619. During his tenure, he was alleged to have miraculously saved the cathedral, and much of the town of Canterbury, from a fire. After his death in 624, Mellitus was revered as a saint.

==Early life==
The medieval chronicler Bede described Mellitus as being of noble birth. In letters, Pope Gregory I called him an abbot, but it is unclear whether Mellitus had previously been abbot of a Roman monastery, or this was a rank bestowed on him to ease his journey to England by making him the leader of the expedition. The papal register, a listing of letters sent out by the popes, describes him as an &quot;abbot in Frankia&quot; in its description of the correspondence, but the letter itself only says &quot;abbot&quot;. The first time Mellitus is mentioned in history is in the letters of Gregory, and nothing else of his background is known. It appears likely that he was a native of Italy, along with all the other bishops consecrated by Augustine.

==Journey to England==

Pope Gregory I sent Mellitus to England in June 601, in response to an appeal from Augustine, the first Archbishop of Canterbury. Augustine needed more clergy to join the Gregorian mission that was converting the kingdom of Kent, then ruled by Æthelberht, from paganism to Christianity. The new missionaries brought with them a gift of books and &quot;all things which were needed for worship and the ministry of the Church.&quot; Thomas of Elmham, a 15th-century Canterbury chronicler, claimed that in his day there were a number of the books brought to England by Mellitus still at Canterbury. Examination of the remaining manuscripts has determined that one possible survivor of Mellitus&#x27; books is the St Augustine Gospels, now in Cambridge, as Corpus Christi College, MS (manuscript) 286. Along with the letter to Augustine, the missionaries brought a letter for Æthelberht, urging the King to act like the Roman Emperor Constantine I and force the conversion of his followers to Christianity. The king was also encouraged to destroy all pagan shrines.

The historian Ian Wood has suggested that Mellitus&#x27; journey through Gaul probably took in the bishoprics of Vienne, Arles, Lyons, Toulon, Marseilles, Metz, Paris, and Rouen, as evidenced by the letters that Gregory addressed to those bishops soliciting their support for Mellitus&#x27; party. Gregory also wrote to the Frankish kings Chlothar II, Theuderic II, Theudebert II, along with Brunhilda of Austrasia, who was Theudebert and Theuderic&#x27;s grandmother and regent. Wood feels that this wide appeal to the Frankish episcopate and royalty was an effort to secure more support for the Gregorian mission. While on his journey to England, Mellitus received a letter from Gregory allowing Augustine to convert pagan temples to Christian churches, and to convert pagan animal sacrifices into Christian feasts, to ease the transition to Christianity. Gregory&#x27;s letter marked a sea change in the missionary strategy, and was later included in Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;. Usually known as the &quot;Epistola ad Mellitum&quot;, it conflicts with the letter sent to Æthelberht, which the historian R. A. Markus sees as a turning point in missionary history, when forcible conversion gave way to persuasion. This traditional view, that the &quot;Epistola&quot; represents a contradiction of the letter to Æthelberht, has been challenged by the historian and theologian George Demacopoulos, who argues that the letter to Æthelberht was mainly meant to encourage the King in spiritual matters, while the &quot;Epistola&quot; was sent to deal with purely practical matters, and thus the two do not contradict each other.

==Bishop of London==
Exactly when Mellitus and his party arrived in England is unknown, but he was certainly in the country by 604, when Augustine consecrated him as bishop in the province of the East Saxons, making Mellitus the first Bishop of London after the Roman departure (London was the East Saxons&#x27; capital). The city was a logical choice for a new bishopric, as it was a hub for the southern road network. It was also a former Roman town; many of the Gregorian mission&#x27;s efforts were centred in such locations. Before his consecration, Mellitus baptised Sæberht, Æthelberht&#x27;s nephew, who then allowed the bishopric to be established. The episcopal church built in London was probably founded by Æthelberht, rather than Sæberht. Although Bede records that Æthelberht gave lands to support the new episcopate, a charter that claims to be a grant of lands from Æthelberht to Mellitus is a later forgery.

Although Gregory had intended London to be the southern archbishopric for the island, Augustine never moved his episcopal see to London, and instead consecrated Mellitus as a plain bishop there. After Augustine&#x27;s death in 604, Canterbury continued to be the site of the southern archbishopric, and London remained a bishopric. It may have been that the Kentish king did not wish greater episcopal authority to be exercised outside his own kingdom.

Mellitus attended a council of bishops held in Italy in February 610, convened by Pope Boniface IV. The historian N. J. Higham speculates that one reason for his attendance may have been to assert the English Church&#x27;s independence from the Frankish Church. Boniface had Mellitus take two papal letters back to England, one to Æthelbert and his people, and another to Laurence, the Archbishop of Canterbury. He also brought back the synod&#x27;s decrees to England. No authentic letters or documents from this synod remain, although some were forged in the 1060s and 1070s at Canterbury. During his time as a bishop, Mellitus joined with Justus, the Bishop of Rochester, in signing a letter that Laurence wrote to the Celtic bishops urging the Celtic Church to adopt the Roman method of calculating the date of Easter. This letter also mentioned the fact that Irish missionary bishops, such as Dagan, refused to eat with the Roman missionaries.

Both Æthelberht and Sæberht died around 616 or 618, causing a crisis for the mission. Sæberht&#x27;s three sons had not converted to Christianity, and drove Mellitus from London. Bede says that Mellitus was exiled because he refused the brothers&#x27; request for a taste of the sacramental bread. Whether this occurred immediately after Sæberht&#x27;s death or later is impossible to determine from Bede&#x27;s chronology, which has both events in the same chapter but gives neither an exact time frame nor the elapsed time between the two events. The historian N. J. Higham connects the timing of this episode with a change in the &quot;overkingship&quot; from the Christian Kentish Æthelberht to the pagan East Anglian Raedwald, which Higham feels happened after Æthelberht&#x27;s death. In Higham&#x27;s view, Sæberht&#x27;s sons drove Mellitus from London because they had passed from Kentish overlordship to East Anglian, and thus no longer needed to keep Mellitus, who was connected with the Kentish kingdom, in office.

Mellitus fled first to Canterbury, but Æthelberht&#x27;s successor Eadbald was also a pagan, so Mellitus, accompanied by Justus, took refuge in Gaul. Mellitus was recalled to Britain by Laurence, the second Archbishop of Canterbury, after his conversion of Eadbald. How long Mellitus&#x27; exile lasted is unclear. Bede claims it was a year, but it may have been longer. Mellitus did not return to London, because the East Saxons remained pagan. Although Mellitus fled, there does not seem to have been any serious persecution of Christians in the East Saxon kingdom. The East Saxon see was not occupied again until Cedd was consecrated as bishop in about 654.

==Archbishop and death==
Mellitus succeeded Laurence as the third Archbishop of Canterbury after the latter&#x27;s death in 619. During his tenure as archbishop, Mellitus supposedly performed a miracle in 623 by diverting a fire that had started in Canterbury and threatened the church. He was carried into the flames, upon which the wind changed direction, thus saving the building. Bede praised Mellitus&#x27; sane mind, but other than the miracle, little happened during his time as archbishop. Bede also mentioned that Mellitus suffered from gout. Boniface wrote to Mellitus encouraging him in the mission, perhaps prompted by the marriage of Æthelburh of Kent to King Edwin of Northumbria. Whether Mellitus received a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop&#x27;s authority, from the pope is unknown.

Mellitus died on 24 April 624, and was buried at St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey in Canterbury that same day. He became revered as a saint after his death, and was allotted the feast day of 24 April. In the ninth century, Mellitus&#x27; feast day was mentioned in the Stowe Missal, along with Laurence and Justus. He was still venerated at St Augustine&#x27;s in 1120, along with a number of other local saints. There was also a shrine to him at Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. Shortly after the Norman Conquest, Goscelin wrote a life of Mellitus, the first of several to appear around that time, but none contain any information not included in Bede&#x27;s earlier works. These later medieval lives do, however, reveal that during Goscelin&#x27;s lifetime persons suffering from gout were urged to pray at Mellitus&#x27; tomb. Goscelin records that Mellitus&#x27; shrine flanked that of Augustine, along with Laurence, in the eastern central chapel of the presbytery.

<text>The M&#x27;Naghten rule(s) (pronounced, and sometimes spelled, McNaughton) is a legal test defining the defence of insanity that was formulated by the House of Lords in 1843. It is the established standard in UK criminal law. Versions have been adopted in some US states, currently or formerly, and other jurisdictions, either as case law or by statute. Its original wording is a proposed jury instruction:

The rule was created in reaction to the acquittal in 1843 of Daniel M&#x27;Naghten on the charge of murdering Edward Drummond. M&#x27;Naghten had shot Drummond after mistakenly identifying him as the British Prime Minister Robert Peel, who was the intended target. The acquittal of M&#x27;Naghten on the basis of insanity, a hitherto unheard-of defence &quot;per se&quot; in modern form, caused a public uproar, with protests from the establishment and the press, even prompting Queen Victoria to write to Robert Peel calling for a &quot;wider interpretation of the verdict&quot;. The House of Lords, using a medieval right to question judges, asked a panel of judges presided over by Sir Nicolas Conyngham Tindal, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, a series of hypothetical questions about the defence of insanity. The principles expounded by this panel have come to be known as the &quot;M&#x27;Naghten Rules&quot;. M&#x27;Naghten himself would have been found guilty if they had been applied at his trial.

The rules so formulated as &quot;M&#x27;Naghten&#x27;s Case&quot; 1843 10 C &amp; F 200, or variations of them, are a standard test for criminal liability in relation to mentally disordered defendants in various jurisdictions, either in common law or enacted by statute. When the tests set out by the rules are satisfied, the accused may be adjudged &quot;not guilty by reason of insanity&quot; or &quot;guilty but insane&quot; and the sentence may be a mandatory or discretionary, but usually indeterminate, period of treatment in a secure hospital facility, or otherwise at the discretion of the court, depending on the country and the offence charged, instead of a punitive disposal.

==Historical development==

There are various justifications for the exemption of the insane from criminal responsibility. When mental incapacity is successfully raised as a defence in a criminal trial it absolves a defendant from liability: it applies public policies in relation to criminal responsibility by applying a rationale of compassion, accepting that it is morally wrong to punish a person if that person is deprived permanently or temporarily of the capacity to form a necessary mental intent that the definition of a crime requires. Punishment of the obviously mentally ill by the state may undermine public confidence in the penal system. A utilitarian and humanitarian approach suggests that the interests of society are better served by treatment.

Historically, insanity was seen as grounds for leniency. In pre-Norman times in England there was no distinct criminal code – a murderer could pay compensation to the victim&#x27;s family under the principle of &quot;buy off the spear or bear it&quot;. The insane person&#x27;s family were expected to pay any compensation for the crime. In Norman times, insanity was not seen as a defence in itself, but a special circumstance in which the jury would deliver a guilty verdict and refer the defendant to the King for a pardon

since they are without sense and reason and can no more commit a tort or a felony than a brute animal, since they are not far removed from brutes, as is evident in the case of a minor, for if he should kill another while under age he would not suffer judgment.

In &quot;R v Arnold&quot; 1724 16 How St. Tr. 765, the test for insanity was expressed in the following terms

whether the accused is totally deprived of his understanding and memory and knew what he was doing &quot;no more than a wild beast or a brute, or an infant&quot;.

The next major advance occurred in &quot;Hadfield&#x27;s Trial&quot; 1800 27 How St. Tr. 765, in which the court decided that a crime committed under some delusion would be excused, only if it would have been excusable had the delusion been true. This would deal with the situation, for example, when the accused imagines he is cutting through a loaf of bread, whereas in fact he is cutting through a person&#x27;s neck.

Each jurisdiction may have its own standards of the insanity defence. More than one standard can be applied to any case based on multiple jurisdictions.

==M&#x27;Naghten rules==
The House of Lords delivered the following exposition of the rules:
the jurors ought to be told in all cases that every man is to be presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction; and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.
The central issue of this definition may be stated as, &quot;Did the defendant know what he was doing, or, if so, that it was wrong?&quot;, and the issues raised have been analysed in subsequent appellate decisions.

===Presumption of sanity and burden of proof===
Sanity is a rebuttable presumption and the burden of proof is on the party denying it; the standard of proof is on a balance of probabilities, that is to say that mental incapacity is more likely than not. If this burden is successfully discharged, the party relying upon it is entitled to succeed. In Lord Denning&#x27;s judgement in &quot;Bratty v Attorney-General for Northern Ireland&quot; 1963 AC 386, whenever the defendant makes an issue of his state of mind, the prosecution can adduce evidence of insanity. However, this will normally only arise to negate the defence case when automatism or diminished responsibility is in issue. 

In practical terms, the defence will be more likely to raise the issue of mental incapacity to negate or minimise criminal liability. In &quot;R v Clarke&quot; 1972 1 All E R 219 a defendant charged with a shoplifting claimed she had no &quot;mens rea&quot; because she had absent-mindedly walked out of the shop without paying because she suffered from depression. When the prosecution attempted to adduce evidence that this constituted insanity within the Rules, she changed her plea to guilty, but on appeal the Court ruled that she had been merely denying mens rea rather than raising a defence under the Rules and her conviction was quashed. The general rule was stated that the Rules apply only to cases in which the defect of reason is substantial.

===Disease of the mind===
Whether a particular condition amounts to a disease of the mind within the Rules is not a medical but a legal question to be decided in accordance with the ordinary rules of interpretation. It seems that any disease which produces a malfunctioning of the mind is a disease of the mind and need not be a disease of the brain itself. The term has been held to cover numerous conditions:
The courts have clearly drawn a distinction between internal and external factors affecting a defendant&#x27;s mental condition. This is partly based on risk of recurrence, whereby the High Court of Australia has expressed that the defence of automatism is unable to be considered when the mental disorder has been proved transient and as such not likely to recur. However, the distinction between insanity and automatism is difficult because the distinction between internal and external divide is difficult. 

Many diseases consist of a predisposition, considered an internal cause, combined with a precipitant, which would be considered an external cause. Actions committed while sleepwalking would normally be considered as &quot;non-insane automatism&quot;, but often alcohol and stress trigger bouts of sleepwalking and make them more likely to be violent. The diabetic who takes insulin but does not eat properly – is that an internal or external cause?

===Nature and quality of the act===
This phrase refers to the physical nature and quality of the act, rather than the moral quality. It covers the situation where the defendant does not know what he is physically doing. Two common examples used are:
* The defendant cuts a woman&#x27;s throat under the delusion that he is cutting a loaf of bread,
* The defendant chops off a sleeping man&#x27;s head because he has the deluded idea that it would be great fun to see the man looking for it when he wakes up.
The judges were specifically asked if a person could be excused if he committed an offence in consequence of an insane delusion. They replied that if he labours under such partial delusion only, and is not in other respects insane, &quot;he must be considered in the same situation as to responsibility as if the facts with respect to which the delusion exists were real&quot;. This rule requires the court to take the facts as the accused believed them to be and follows &quot;Hadfield&#x27;s Trial&quot;, above. If the delusions do not prevent the defendant from having mens rea there will be no defence. 

In &quot;R v Bell&quot; 1984 Crim. LR 685, the defendant smashed a van through the entrance gates of a holiday camp because &quot;It was like a secret society in there, I wanted to do my bit against it&quot; as instructed by God. It was held that, as the defendant had been aware of his actions, he could neither have been in a state of automatism nor insane, and the fact that he believed that God had told him to do this merely provided an explanation of his motive and did not prevent him from knowing that what he was doing was wrong in the legal sense.

===Knowledge that the act was wrong===
The interpretation of this clause is a subject of controversy among legal authorities, and different standards may apply in different jurisdictions.

&quot;Wrong&quot; was interpreted to mean &quot;legally&quot; wrong, rather than &quot;morally&quot; wrong, in the case of &quot;Windle&quot; 1952 2QB 826; 1952 2 All ER 1 246, where the defendant killed his wife with an overdose of aspirin; he telephoned the police and said, &quot;I suppose they will hang me for this.&quot; It was held that this was sufficient to show that although the defendant was suffering from a mental illness, he was aware that his act was wrong, and the defence was not allowed. 

Under this interpretation, there may be cases where the mentally ill know that their conduct is legally prohibited, but it is arguable that their mental condition prevents them making the connection between an act being legally prohibited and the societal requirement to conform their conduct to the requirements of the criminal law.

As an example of a contrasting interpretation in which defendant lacking knowledge that the act was &quot;morally&quot; wrong meets the M&#x27;Naghten standards, there are the instructions the judge is required to provide to the jury in cases in New York State when the defendant has raised an insanity plea as a defence:
... with respect to the term &quot;wrong&quot;, a person lacks substantial capacity to know or appreciate that conduct is wrong if that person, as a result of mental disease or defect, lacked substantial capacity to know or appreciate either that the conduct was against the law or that it was against commonly held moral principles, or both.
There is other support in the authorities for this interpretation of the standards enunciated in the findings presented to the House of Lords regarding M&#x27;Naghten&#x27;s case:
If it be accepted, as can hardly be denied, that the answers of the judges to the questions asked by the House of Lords in 1843 are to be read in the light of the then existing case-law and not as novel pronouncements of a legislative character, then the [Australian] High Court&#x27;s analysis in &quot;Stapleton&#x27;s Case&quot; is compelling. Their exhaustive examination of the extensive case-law concerning the defence of insanity prior to and at the time of the trial of M&#x27;Naughten establishes convincingly that it was morality and not legality which lay as a concept behind the judges&#x27; use of &quot;wrong&quot; in the M&#x27;Naghten rules.
===Offences of strict liability===
In &quot;DPP v Harper&quot; (1997) it was held that insanity is not generally a defence to strict liability offences. In this instance, the accused was driving with excess alcohol. By definition, the accused is sufficiently aware of the nature of the activity to commit the &quot;actus reus&quot; of driving and presumably knows that driving while drunk is legally wrong. Any other feature of the accused&#x27;s knowledge is irrelevant.

===Function of the jury===
Section 1 of the United Kingdoms&#x27; Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991 provides that a jury shall not return a special verdict that &quot;the accused is not guilty by reason of insanity&quot; except on the written or oral evidence of two or more registered medical practitioners of whom at least one has special experience in the field of mental disorder. This may require the jury to decide between conflicting medical evidence which they are not necessarily equipped to do, but the law goes further and allows them to disagree with the experts if there are facts or surrounding circumstances which, in the opinion of the court, justify the jury in coming to that conclusion.

===Sentencing===
Under section 5 of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964 (as amended):
# Where the sentence for the offence to which the finding relates is fixed by law (e.g. murder), the court must make a hospital order (see section 37 Mental Health Act 1983) with a restriction order limiting discharge and other rights (see section 41 Mental Health Act 1983).
# In any other case the court may make:
#* a hospital order (with or without a restriction order);
#* a supervision order; or
#* an order for absolute discharge.

===Criticisms===

There have been four major criticisms of the law as it currently stands:
* Medical irrelevance – The legal definition of insanity has not advanced significantly since 1843; in 1953 evidence was given to the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment that doctors even then regarded the legal definition to be obsolete and misleading. This distinction has led to absurdities such as
** even though a legal definition suffices, mandatory hospitalisation can be ordered in cases of murder; if the defendant is not &quot;medically&quot; insane, there is little point in requiring medical treatment.
** Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, imported into English law by the Human Rights Act 1998, provides that a person of unsound mind may be detained only where proper account of objective medical expertise has been taken. As yet, no cases have occurred in which this point has been argued.
* Ineffectiveness – The rules currently do not distinguish between defendants who represent a public danger and those who do not. Illnesses such as diabetes and epilepsy can be controlled by medication such that sufferers are less likely to have temporary aberrations of mental capacity, but the law does not recognise this.
* Sentencing for murder – A finding of insanity may well result in indefinite confinement in a hospital, whereas a conviction for murder may well result in a determinate sentence of between ten and 15 years; faced with this choice, it may be that defendants would prefer the certainty of the latter option. The defence of diminished responsibility in section 2(1) of the Homicide Act would reduce the conviction to voluntary manslaughter with more discretion on the part of the judge in regards to sentencing.
* Scope – A practical issue is whether the fact that an accused is labouring under a &quot;mental disability&quot; should be a necessary but not sufficient condition for negating responsibility i.e. whether the test should also require an incapacity to understand what is being done, to know that what one is doing is wrong, or to control an impulse to do something and so demonstrate a causal link between the disability and the potentially criminal acts and omissions. For example, the Irish insanity defence comprises the M&#x27;Naghten Rules and a control test that asks whether the accused was debarred from refraining from committing the act because of a defect of reason due to mental illness (see &quot;Doyle v Wicklow County Council&quot; 1974) 55 IR 71. The Butler Committee recommended that proof of severe mental disorder should be sufficient to negate responsibility, in effect creating an irrebuttable presumption of irresponsibility arising from proof of a severe mental disorder. This has been criticised as it assumes a lack of criminal responsibility simply because there is evidence of some sort of mental dysfunction, rather than establishing a standard of criminal responsibility. According to this view, the law should be geared to culpability not mere psychiatric diagnosis.

==Alternative rules==

The insanity defence article has a number of alternative tests that have been used at different times and places. As one example, the ALI test replaced the M&#x27;Naghten rule in many parts of the United States for many years until the 1980s; when, in the aftermath of John Hinckley shooting US President Ronald Reagan, many ALI states returned to a variation of M&#x27;Naghten.

==In popular culture==
The M&#x27;Naghten rules are at the focus of John Grisham&#x27;s legal thriller &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;. The M&#x27;Naghten rules apply in the US State of Mississippi, where the plot is set, and using them is the only way for the lawyer protagonist to save his client.

<text>A mineraloid is a naturally occurring substance that resembles a mineral, but does not demonstrate the crystallinity of a mineral. Mineraloid substances possess chemical compositions that vary beyond the generally accepted ranges for specific minerals, for example, obsidian is an amorphous glass and not a true crystal; lignite (jet) is derived from the decay of wood under extreme pressure underground; and opal is a mineraloid substance because of its non-crystalline nature. Pearl is a mineraloid substance because the calcite crystals and the aragonite crystals are bonded by an organic material, and naturally occurs without definite proportions of the components.

The first usage of the term &quot;mineraloid&quot; substance was in 1909, by mineralogist and geologist Julian Niedzwiedzki, in identifying and describing amorphous substances that resemble minerals.

<doc id="20728" wikidata="Q606855" url="?curid=20728" title="Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics">
<text>The mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics are those mathematical formalisms that permit a rigorous description of quantum mechanics. This mathematical formalism uses mainly a part of functional analysis, especially Hilbert spaces, which are a kind of linear space. Such are distinguished from mathematical formalisms for physics theories developed prior to the early 1900s by the use of abstract mathematical structures, such as infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces (&quot;L&quot;2 space mainly), and operators on these spaces. In brief, values of physical observables such as energy and momentum were no longer considered as values of functions on phase space, but as eigenvalues; more precisely as spectral values of linear operators in Hilbert space.

These formulations of quantum mechanics continue to be used today. At the heart of the description are ideas of &quot;quantum state&quot; and &quot;quantum observables&quot;, which are radically different from those used in previous models of physical reality. While the mathematics permits calculation of many quantities that can be measured experimentally, there is a definite theoretical limit to values that can be simultaneously measured. This limitation was first elucidated by Heisenberg through a thought experiment, and is represented mathematically in the new formalism by the non-commutativity of operators representing quantum observables.

Prior to the development of quantum mechanics as a separate theory, the mathematics used in physics consisted mainly of formal mathematical analysis, beginning with calculus, and increasing in complexity up to differential geometry and partial differential equations. Probability theory was used in statistical mechanics. Geometric intuition played a strong role in the first two and, accordingly, theories of relativity were formulated entirely in terms of differential geometric concepts. The phenomenology of quantum physics arose roughly between 1895 and 1915, and for the 10 to 15 years before the development of quantum mechanics (around 1925) physicists continued to think of quantum theory within the confines of what is now called classical physics, and in particular within the same mathematical structures. The most sophisticated example of this is the Sommerfeld–Wilson–Ishiwara quantization rule, which was formulated entirely on the classical phase space.

== History of the formalism ==

=== The &quot;old quantum theory&quot; and the need for new mathematics ===
In the 1890s, Planck was able to derive the blackbody spectrum, which was later used to avoid the classical ultraviolet catastrophe by making the unorthodox assumption that, in the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter, energy could only be exchanged in discrete units which he called quanta. Planck postulated a direct proportionality between the frequency of radiation and the quantum of energy at that frequency. The proportionality constant, , is now called the Planck constant in his honor.

In 1905, Einstein explained certain features of the photoelectric effect by assuming that Planck&#x27;s energy quanta were actual particles, which were later dubbed photons.
All of these developments were phenomenological and challenged the theoretical physics of the time. Bohr and Sommerfeld went on to modify classical mechanics in an attempt to deduce the Bohr model from first principles. They proposed that, of all closed classical orbits traced by a mechanical system in its phase space, only the ones that enclosed an area which was a multiple of the Planck constant were actually allowed. The most sophisticated version of this formalism was the so-called Sommerfeld–Wilson–Ishiwara quantization. Although the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom could be explained in this way, the spectrum of the helium atom (classically an unsolvable 3-body problem) could not be predicted. The mathematical status of quantum theory remained uncertain for some time.

In 1923, de Broglie proposed that wave–particle duality applied not only to photons but to electrons and every other physical system.

The situation changed rapidly in the years 1925–1930, when working mathematical foundations were found through the groundbreaking work of Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Pascual Jordan, and the foundational work of John von Neumann, Hermann Weyl and Paul Dirac, and it became possible to unify several different approaches in terms of a fresh set of ideas. The physical interpretation of the theory was also clarified in these years after Werner Heisenberg discovered the uncertainty relations and Niels Bohr introduced the idea of complementarity.

=== The &quot;new quantum theory&quot; ===

Werner Heisenberg&#x27;s matrix mechanics was the first successful attempt at replicating the observed quantization of atomic spectra. Later in the same year, Schrödinger created his wave mechanics. Schrödinger&#x27;s formalism was considered easier to understand, visualize and calculate as it led to differential equations, which physicists were already familiar with solving. Within a year, it was shown that the two theories were equivalent.

Schrödinger himself initially did not understand the fundamental probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, as he thought that the absolute square of the wave function of an electron should be interpreted as the charge density of an object smeared out over an extended, possibly infinite, volume of space. It was Max Born who introduced the interpretation of the absolute square of the wave function as the probability distribution of the position of a &quot;pointlike&quot; object. Born&#x27;s idea was soon taken over by Niels Bohr in Copenhagen who then became the &quot;father&quot; of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. Schrödinger&#x27;s wave function can be seen to be closely related to the classical Hamilton–Jacobi equation. The correspondence to classical mechanics was even more explicit, although somewhat more formal, in Heisenberg&#x27;s matrix mechanics. In his PhD thesis project, Paul Dirac discovered that the equation for the operators in the Heisenberg representation, as it is now called, closely translates to classical equations for the dynamics of certain quantities in the Hamiltonian formalism of classical mechanics, when one expresses them through Poisson brackets, a procedure now known as canonical quantization.

Already before Schrödinger, the young postdoctoral fellow Werner Heisenberg invented his matrix mechanics, which was the first correct quantum mechanics – the essential breakthrough. Heisenberg&#x27;s matrix mechanics formulation was based on algebras of infinite matrices, a very radical formulation in light of the mathematics of classical physics, although he started from the index-terminology of the experimentalists of that time, not even aware that his &quot;index-schemes&quot; were matrices, as Born soon pointed out to him. In fact, in these early years, linear algebra was not generally popular with physicists in its present form.

Although Schrödinger himself after a year proved the equivalence of his wave-mechanics and Heisenberg&#x27;s matrix mechanics, the reconciliation of the two approaches and their modern abstraction as motions in Hilbert space is generally attributed to Paul Dirac, who wrote a lucid account in his 1930 classic &quot;The Principles of Quantum Mechanics&quot;. He is the third, and possibly most important, pillar of that field (he soon was the only one to have discovered a relativistic generalization of the theory). In his above-mentioned account, he introduced the bra–ket notation, together with an abstract formulation in terms of the Hilbert space used in functional analysis; he showed that Schrödinger&#x27;s and Heisenberg&#x27;s approaches were two different representations of the same theory, and found a third, most general one, which represented the dynamics of the system. His work was particularly fruitful in many types of generalizations of the field.

The first complete mathematical formulation of this approach, known as the Dirac–von Neumann axioms, is generally credited to John von Neumann&#x27;s 1932 book &quot;Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics&quot;, although Hermann Weyl had already referred to Hilbert spaces (which he called &quot;unitary spaces&quot;) in his 1927 classic paper and book. It was developed in parallel with a new approach to the mathematical spectral theory based on linear operators rather than the quadratic forms that were David Hilbert&#x27;s approach a generation earlier. Though theories of quantum mechanics continue to evolve to this day, there is a basic framework for the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics which underlies most approaches and can be traced back to the mathematical work of John von Neumann. In other words, discussions about &quot;interpretation&quot; of the theory, and extensions to it, are now mostly conducted on the basis of shared assumptions about the mathematical foundations.

=== Later developments ===

The application of the new quantum theory to electromagnetism resulted in quantum field theory, which was developed starting around 1930. Quantum field theory has driven the development of more sophisticated formulations of quantum mechanics, of which the ones presented here are simple special cases. 
* Path integral formulation
* Phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics &amp; geometric quantization
* quantum field theory in curved spacetime
* axiomatic, algebraic and constructive quantum field theory
* C*-algebra formalism
* Generalized statistical model of quantum mechanics

A related topic is the relationship to classical mechanics. Any new physical theory is supposed to reduce to successful old theories in some approximation. For quantum mechanics, this translates into the need to study the so-called classical limit of quantum mechanics. Also, as Bohr emphasized, human cognitive abilities and language are inextricably linked to the classical realm, and so classical descriptions are intuitively more accessible than quantum ones. In particular, quantization, namely the construction of a quantum theory whose classical limit is a given and known classical theory, becomes an important area of quantum physics in itself.

Finally, some of the originators of quantum theory (notably Einstein and Schrödinger) were unhappy with what they thought were the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics. In particular, Einstein took the position that quantum mechanics must be incomplete, which motivated research into so-called hidden-variable theories. The issue of hidden variables has become in part an experimental issue with the help of quantum optics.

== Postulates of quantum mechanics ==
A physical system is generally described by three basic ingredients: states; observables; and dynamics (or law of time evolution) or, more generally, a group of physical symmetries. A classical description can be given in a fairly direct way by a phase space model of mechanics: states are points in a phase space formulated by symplectic manifold, observables are real-valued functions on it, time evolution is given by a one-parameter group of symplectic transformations of the phase space, and physical symmetries are realized by symplectic transformations. A quantum description normally consists of a Hilbert space of states, observables are self-adjoint operators on the space of states, time evolution is given by a one-parameter group of unitary transformations on the Hilbert space of states, and physical symmetries are realized by unitary transformations. (It is possible, to map this Hilbert-space picture to a phase space formulation, invertibly. See below.)

The following summary of the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics can be partly traced back to the Dirac–von Neumann axioms.

=== Description of the state of a system ===
Each isolated physical system is associated with a (topologically) separable complex Hilbert space with inner product .

Separability is a mathematically convenient hypothesis, with the physical interpretation that the state is uniquely determined by countably many observations. Quantum states can be identified with equivalence classes in , where two vectors (of length 1) represent the same state if they differ only by a phase factor:
formula_1
As such, a quantum state forms a ray in projective Hilbert space, not a &quot;vector&quot;.

Accompanying Postulate I is the composite system postulate:

In the presence of quantum entanglement, the quantum state of the composite system cannot be factored as a tensor product of states of its local constituents; Instead, it is expressed as a sum, or superposition, of tensor products of states of component subsystems. A subsystem in an entangled composite system generally cannot be described by a state vector (or a ray), but instead is described by a density operator; Such quantum state is known as a mixed state. The density operator of a mixed state is a trace class, nonnegative (positive semi-definite) self-adjoint operator normalized to be of trace 1. In turn, any density operator of a mixed state can be represented as a subsystem of a larger composite system in a pure state (see purification theorem).

In the absence of quantum entanglement, the quantum state of the composite system is called a separable state. The density matrix of a bipartite system in a separable state can be expressed as formula_2, where formula_3. If there is only a single non-zero formula_4, then the state can be expressed just as formula_5 and is called simply separable or product state.

=== Measurement on a system ===

==== Description of physical quantities ====
Physical observables are represented by Hermitian matrices on . Since these operators are Hermitian, their eigenvalues are always real, and represent the possible outcomes/results from measuring the corresponding observable. If the spectrum of the observable is discrete, then the possible results are &quot;quantized&quot;.

==== Results of measurement ====
By spectral theory, we can associate a probability measure to the values of in any state . We can also show that the possible values of the observable in any state must belong to the spectrum of . The expectation value (in the sense of probability theory) of the observable for the system in state represented by the unit vector ∈ &quot;H&quot; is formula_6. If we represent the state in the basis formed by the eigenvectors of , then the square of the modulus of the component attached to a given eigenvector is the probability of observing its corresponding eigenvalue.

For a mixed state , the expected value of in the state is formula_7, and the probability of obtaining an eigenvalue formula_8 in a discrete, nondegenerate spectrum of the corresponding observable formula_9 is given by formula_10.

If the eigenvalue formula_8 has degenerate, orthonormal eigenvectors formula_12, then the projection operator onto the eigensubspace can be defined as the identity operator in the eigensubspace:
formula_13
and then formula_14.

Postulates II.a and II.b are collectively known as the Born rule of quantum mechanics.

==== Effect of measurement on the state ====

When a measurement is performed, only one result is obtained (according to some interpretations of quantum mechanics). This is modeled mathematically as the processing of additional information from the measurement, confining the probabilities of an immediate second measurement of the same observable. In the case of a discrete, non-degenerate spectrum, two sequential measurements of the same observable will always give the same value assuming the second immediately follows the first. Therefore, the state vector must change as a result of measurement, and &quot;collapse&quot; onto the eigensubspace associated with the eigenvalue measured. &lt;/math&gt;
| width = 50%
| align = center
| qalign = center

For a mixed state , after obtaining an eigenvalue formula_8 in a discrete, nondegenerate spectrum of the corresponding observable formula_9, the updated state is given by formula_17. If the eigenvalue formula_8 has degenerate, orthonormal eigenvectors formula_19, then the projection operator onto the eigensubspace is formula_20.

Postulates II.c is sometimes called the &quot;state update rule&quot; or &quot;collapse rule&quot;; Together with the Born rule (Postulates II.a and II.b), they form a complete representation of measurements, and are sometimes collectively called the measurement postulate(s).

Note that the projection-valued measures (PVM) described in the measurement postulate(s) can be generalized to positive operator-valued measures (POVM), which is the most general kind of measurement in quantum mechanics. A POVM can be understood as the effect on a component subsystem when a PVM is performed on a larger, composite system (see Naimark&#x27;s dilation theorem).

=== Time evolution of a system ===
Though it is possible to derive the Schrödinger equation, which describes how a state vector evolves in time, most texts assert the equation as a postulate. Common derivations include using the de Broglie hypothesis or path integrals.

Equivalently, the time evolution postulate can be stated as:

For a closed system in a mixed state , the time evolution is formula_21.

The evolution of an open quantum system can be described by quantum operations (in an operator sum formalism) and quantum instruments, and generally does not have to be unitary.

=== Other implications of the postulates ===
* Physical symmetries act on the Hilbert space of quantum states unitarily or antiunitarily due to Wigner&#x27;s theorem (supersymmetry is another matter entirely).
* Density operators are those that are in the closure of the convex hull of the one-dimensional orthogonal projectors. Conversely, one-dimensional orthogonal projectors are extreme points of the set of density operators. Physicists also call one-dimensional orthogonal projectors &quot;pure states&quot; and other density operators &quot;mixed states&quot;.
* One can in this formalism state Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle and prove it as a theorem, although the exact historical sequence of events, concerning who derived what and under which framework, is the subject of historical investigations outside the scope of this article.
* Recent research has shown that the composite system postulate (tensor product postulate) can be derived from the state postulate (Postulate I) and the measurement postulates (Postulates II); Moreover, it has also been shown that the measurement postulates (Postulates II) can be derived from &quot;unitary quantum mechanics&quot;, which includes only the state postulate (Postulate I), the composite system postulate (tensor product postulate) and the unitary evolution postulate (Postulate III).

Furthermore, to the postulates of quantum mechanics one should also add basic statements on the properties of spin and Pauli&#x27;s exclusion principle, see below.

=== Spin ===

In addition to their other properties, all particles possess a quantity called spin, an &quot;intrinsic angular momentum&quot;. Despite the name, particles do not literally spin around an axis, and quantum mechanical spin has no correspondence in classical physics. In the position representation, a spinless wavefunction has position and time as continuous variables, . For spin wavefunctions the spin is an additional discrete variable: , where takes the values;
formula_22

That is, the state of a single particle with spin is represented by a -component spinor of complex-valued wave functions.

Two classes of particles with &quot;very different&quot; behaviour are bosons which have integer spin (), and fermions possessing half-integer spin ().

=== Symmetrization postulate ===

In quantum mechanics, two particles can be distinguished from one another using two methods. By performing a measurement of intrinsic properties of each particle, particles of different types can be distinguished. Otherwise, if the particles are identical, their trajectories can be tracked which distinguishes the particles based on the locality of each particle. While the second method is permitted in classical mechanics, (i.e. all classical particles are treated with distinguishability), the same cannot be said for quantum mechanical particles since the process is infeasible due to the fundamental uncertainty principles that govern small scales. Hence the requirement of indistinguishability of quantum particles is presented by the symmetrization postulate. The postulate is applicable to a system of bosons or fermions, for example, in predicting the spectra of helium atom. The postulate, explained in the following sections, can be stated as follows:

Exceptions can occur when the particles are constrained to two spatial dimensions where existence of particles known as anyons are possible which are said to have a continuum of statistical properties spanning the range between fermions and bosons. The connection between behaviour of identical particles and their spin is given by spin statistics theorem.

It can be shown that two particles localized in different regions of space can still be represented using a symmetrized/antisymmetrized wavefunction and that independent treatment of these wavefunctions gives the same result. Hence the symmetrization postulate is applicable in the general case of a system of identical particles.

==== Exchange Degeneracy ====
In a system of identical particles, let &quot;P&quot; be known as exchange operator that acts on the wavefunction as:
: formula_23

If a physical system of identical particles is given, wavefunction of all particles can be well known from observation but these cannot be labelled to each particle. Thus, the above exchanged wavefunction represents the same physical state as the original state which implies that the wavefunction is not unique. This is known as exchange degeneracy.

More generally, consider a linear combination of such states, formula_24. For the best representation of the physical system, we expect this to be an eigenvector of &quot;P&quot; since exchange operator is not excepted to give completely different vectors in projective Hilbert space. Since formula_25, the possible eigenvalues of &quot;P&quot; are +1 and −1. The formula_24 states for identical particle system are represented as symmetric for +1 eigenvalue or antisymmetric for -1 eigenvalue as follows:
: formula_27
: formula_28

The explicit symmetric/antisymmetric form of formula_24 is constructed using a symmetrizer or antisymmetrizer operator. Particles that form symmetric states are called bosons and those that form antisymmetric states are called as fermions. The relation of spin with this classification is given from spin statistics theorem which shows that integer spin particles are bosons and half integer spin particles are fermions.

==== Pauli exclusion principle ====
The property of spin relates to another basic property concerning systems of identical particles: the Pauli exclusion principle, which is a consequence of the following permutation behaviour of an -particle wave function; again in the position representation one must postulate that for the transposition of any two of the particles one always should have

i.e., on transposition of the arguments of any two particles the wavefunction should &quot;reproduce&quot;, apart from a prefactor which is for bosons, but () for fermions.
Electrons are fermions with ; quanta of light are bosons with .

Due to the form of anti-symmetrized wavefunction:
: formula_30
if the wavefunction of each particle is completely determined by a set of quantum number, then two fermions cannot share the same set of quantum numbers since the resulting function cannot be anti-symmetrized (i.e. above formula gives zero). The same cannot be said of Bosons since their wavefunction is:
: formula_31
where formula_32 is the number of particles with same wavefunction.

==== Exceptions for symmetrization postulate ====
In nonrelativistic quantum mechanics all particles are either bosons or fermions; in relativistic quantum theories also &quot;supersymmetric&quot; theories exist, where a particle is a linear combination of a bosonic and a fermionic part. Only in dimension can one construct entities where is replaced by an arbitrary complex number with magnitude 1, called anyons. In relativistic quantum mechanics, spin statistic theorem can prove that under certain set of assumptions that the integer spins particles are classified as bosons and half spin particles are classified as fermions. Anyons which form neither symmetric nor antisymmetric states are said to have fractional spin.

Although &quot;spin&quot; and the &quot;Pauli principle&quot; can only be derived from relativistic generalizations of quantum mechanics, the properties mentioned in the last two paragraphs belong to the basic postulates already in the non-relativistic limit. Especially, many important properties in natural science, e.g. the periodic system of chemistry, are consequences of the two properties.

=== Pictures of dynamics ===

&lt;/math&gt; is Dyson&#x27;s time-ordering symbol.

(This symbol permutes a product of noncommuting operators of the form
formula_33
into the uniquely determined re-ordered expression
formula_34 with formula_35

The result is a causal chain, the primary &quot;cause&quot; in the past on the utmost r.h.s., and finally the present &quot;effect&quot; on the utmost l.h.s. .)

| 2 = The Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics focuses on observables and instead of considering states as varying in time, it regards the states as fixed and the observables as changing. To go from the Schrödinger to the Heisenberg picture one needs to define time-independent states and time-dependent operators thus:
formula_36
formula_37
It is then easily checked that the expected values of all observables are the same in both pictures
formula_38
and that the time-dependent Heisenberg operators satisfy

which is true for time-dependent . Notice the commutator expression is purely formal when one of the operators is unbounded. One would specify a representation for the expression to make sense of it.

| 3 = The so-called Dirac picture or interaction picture has time-dependent &quot;states&quot; and observables, evolving with respect to different Hamiltonians. This picture is most useful when the evolution of the observables can be solved exactly, confining any complications to the evolution of the states. For this reason, the Hamiltonian for the observables is called &quot;free Hamiltonian&quot; and the Hamiltonian for the states is called &quot;interaction Hamiltonian&quot;. In symbols:

The interaction picture does not always exist, though. In interacting quantum field theories, Haag&#x27;s theorem states that the interaction picture does not exist. This is because the Hamiltonian cannot be split into a free and an interacting part within a superselection sector. Moreover, even if in the Schrödinger picture the Hamiltonian does not depend on time, e.g. , in the interaction picture it does, at least, if does not commute with , since
formula_39

So the above-mentioned Dyson-series has to be used anyhow.

The Heisenberg picture is the closest to classical Hamiltonian mechanics (for example, the commutators appearing in the above equations directly translate into the classical Poisson brackets); but this is already rather &quot;high-browed&quot;, and the Schrödinger picture is considered easiest to visualize and understand by most people, to judge from pedagogical accounts of quantum mechanics. The Dirac picture is the one used in perturbation theory, and is specially associated to quantum field theory and many-body physics.

Similar equations can be written for any one-parameter unitary group of symmetries of the physical system. Time would be replaced by a suitable coordinate parameterizing the unitary group (for instance, a rotation angle, or a translation distance) and the Hamiltonian would be replaced by the conserved quantity associated with the symmetry (for instance, angular or linear momentum).
Summary:
{{Pictures in quantum mechanics}}

=== Representations ===

The original form of the Schrödinger equation depends on choosing a particular representation of Heisenberg&#x27;s canonical commutation relations. The Stone–von Neumann theorem dictates that all irreducible representations of the finite-dimensional Heisenberg commutation relations are unitarily equivalent. A systematic understanding of its consequences has led to the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics, which works in full phase space instead of Hilbert space, so then with a more intuitive link to the classical limit thereof. This picture also simplifies considerations
of quantization, the deformation extension from classical to quantum mechanics.

The quantum harmonic oscillator is an exactly solvable system where the different representations are easily compared. There, apart from the Heisenberg, or Schrödinger (position or momentum), or phase-space representations, one also encounters the Fock (number) representation and the Segal–Bargmann (Fock-space or coherent state) representation (named after Irving Segal and Valentine Bargmann). All four are unitarily equivalent.

=== Time as an operator ===

The framework presented so far singles out time as &quot;the&quot; parameter that everything depends on. It is possible to formulate mechanics in such a way that time becomes itself an observable associated with a self-adjoint operator. At the classical level, it is possible to arbitrarily parameterize the trajectories of particles in terms of an unphysical parameter {{math|&quot;s&quot;}}, and in that case the time &quot;t&quot; becomes an additional generalized coordinate of the physical system. At the quantum level, translations in {{math|&quot;s&quot;}} would be generated by a &quot;Hamiltonian&quot; {{math|&quot;H&quot; − &quot;E&quot;}}, where &quot;E&quot; is the energy operator and {{math|&quot;H&quot;}} is the &quot;ordinary&quot; Hamiltonian. However, since &quot;s&quot; is an unphysical parameter, &quot;physical&quot; states must be left invariant by &quot;&quot;s&quot;-evolution&quot;, and so the physical state space is the kernel of {{math|&quot;H&quot; − &quot;E&quot;}} (this requires the use of a rigged Hilbert space and a renormalization of the norm).

This is related to the quantization of constrained systems and quantization of gauge theories. It
is also possible to formulate a quantum theory of &quot;events&quot; where time becomes an observable.{{sfn | Edwards | 1979}}

== Problem of measurement ==
{{Main|Measurement in quantum mechanics}}
The picture given in the preceding paragraphs is sufficient for description of a completely isolated system. However, it fails to account for one of the main differences between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics, that is, the effects of measurement.{{sfn | Greenstein | Zajonc | 2006 | p=215}} The von Neumann description of quantum measurement of an observable {{math|&quot;A&quot;}}, when the system is prepared in a pure state {{math|&quot;ψ&quot;}} is the following (note, however, that von Neumann&#x27;s description dates back to the 1930s and is based on experiments as performed during that time – more specifically the Compton–Simon experiment; it is not applicable to most present-day measurements within the quantum domain):
* Let {{math|&quot;A&quot;}} have spectral resolution formula_40 where {{math|E&quot;A&quot;}} is the resolution of the identity (also called projection-valued measure) associated with {{math|&quot;A&quot;}}. Then the probability of the measurement outcome lying in an interval {{math|&quot;B&quot;}} of {{math|R}} is {{math|{{!}}E&quot;A&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) &quot;ψ&quot;{{!}}2}}. In other words, the probability is obtained by integrating the characteristic function of {{math|&quot;B&quot;}} against the countably additive measure formula_41
* If the measured value is contained in {{math|&quot;B&quot;}}, then immediately after the measurement, the system will be in the (generally non-normalized) state {{math|E&quot;A&quot;(&quot;B&quot;)&quot;ψ&quot;}}. If the measured value does not lie in {{math|&quot;B&quot;}}, replace {{math|&quot;B&quot;}} by its complement for the above state.

For example, suppose the state space is the {{math|&quot;n&quot;}}-dimensional complex Hilbert space {{math|C&quot;n&quot;}} and {{math|&quot;A&quot;}} is a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues {{math|&quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot;}}, with corresponding eigenvectors {{math|&quot;ψi&quot;}}. The projection-valued measure associated with {{math|&quot;A&quot;}}, {{math|E&quot;A&quot;}}, is then
formula_42
where {{math|&quot;B&quot;}} is a Borel set containing only the single eigenvalue {{math|&quot;λi&quot;}}. If the system is prepared in state
formula_43
Then the probability of a measurement returning the value {{math|&quot;λi&quot;}} can be calculated by integrating the spectral measure
formula_44
over {{math|&quot;Bi&quot;}}. This gives trivially
formula_45

The characteristic property of the von Neumann measurement scheme is that repeating the same measurement will give the same results. This is also called the &quot;projection postulate&quot;.

A more general formulation replaces the projection-valued measure with a positive-operator valued measure (POVM). To illustrate, take again the finite-dimensional case. Here we would replace the rank-1 projections
formula_46
by a finite set of positive operators
formula_47
whose sum is still the identity operator as before (the resolution of identity). Just as a set of possible outcomes {{math|{&quot;λ&quot;1 ... &quot;λn&quot;} }} is associated to a projection-valued measure, the same can be said for a POVM. Suppose the measurement outcome is {{math|&quot;λi&quot;}}. Instead of collapsing to the (unnormalized) state
formula_48
after the measurement, the system now will be in the state
formula_49

Since the {{math|&quot;Fi Fi*&quot;}} operators need not be mutually orthogonal projections, the projection postulate of von Neumann no longer holds.

The same formulation applies to general mixed states.

In von Neumann&#x27;s approach, the state transformation due to measurement is distinct from that due to time evolution in several ways. For example, time evolution is deterministic and unitary whereas measurement is non-deterministic and non-unitary. However, since both types of state transformation take one quantum state to another, this difference was viewed by many as unsatisfactory. The POVM formalism views measurement as one among many other quantum operations, which are described by completely positive maps which do not increase the trace.

In any case it seems that the above-mentioned problems can only be resolved if the time evolution included not only the quantum system, but also, and essentially, the classical measurement apparatus (see above).

== List of mathematical tools ==

Part of the folklore of the subject concerns the mathematical physics textbook Methods of Mathematical Physics put together by Richard Courant from David Hilbert&#x27;s Göttingen University courses. The story is told (by mathematicians) that physicists had dismissed the material as not interesting in the current research areas, until the advent of Schrödinger&#x27;s equation. At that point it was realised that the mathematics of the new quantum mechanics was already laid out in it. It is also said that Heisenberg had consulted Hilbert about his matrix mechanics, and Hilbert observed that his own experience with infinite-dimensional matrices had derived from differential equations, advice which Heisenberg ignored, missing the opportunity to unify the theory as Weyl and Dirac did a few years later. Whatever the basis of the anecdotes, the mathematics of the theory was conventional at the time, whereas the physics was radically new.

The main tools include:
* linear algebra: complex numbers, eigenvectors, eigenvalues
* functional analysis: Hilbert spaces, linear operators, spectral theory
* differential equations: partial differential equations, separation of variables, ordinary differential equations, Sturm–Liouville theory, eigenfunctions
* harmonic analysis: Fourier transforms

<text>A multiple-document interface (MDI) is a graphical user interface in which multiple windows reside under a single parent window. Such systems often allow child windows to embed other windows inside them as well, creating complex nested hierarchies. This contrasts with single-document interfaces (SDI) where all windows are independent of each other.

==Comparison with single-document interface==
In the usability community, there has been much debate about whether the multiple-document or single-document interface is preferable. Software companies have used both interfaces with mixed responses. For example, Microsoft changed its Office applications from SDI to MDI mode and then back to SDI, although the degree of implementation varies from one component to another. SDI can be more useful in cases where users switch more often between separate applications than among the windows of one application.

MDI can be confusing if it has a lack of information about the currently opened windows. In MDI applications, the application developer must provide a way to switch between documents or view a list of open windows, and the user might have to use an application-specific menu (&quot;window list&quot; or something similar) to switch between open documents. This is different from SDI applications where the window manager&#x27;s task bar or task manager displays the currently opened windows. In recent years it has become increasingly common for MDI applications to use &quot;tabs&quot; to display the currently opened windows. An interface in which tabs are used to manage open documents is referred to as a &quot;tabbed document interface&quot; (TDI). Another option is &quot;tiled&quot; panes or windows, which make it easier to prevent content from overlapping.

Some applications allow the user to switch between these modes at their choosing, depending on personal preference or the task at hand.

Nearly all graphical user interface toolkits to date provide at least one solution for designing MDIs. A notable exception was Apple&#x27;s Cocoa API until the advent of tabbed window groups in MacOS High Sierra. The Java GUI toolkit, Swing, for instance, provides the class which serves as a container for individual frames (class ). GTK lacks any standardized support for MDI.

===Advantages===
* With multiple-document interfaces (and also tabbed document interfaces), a single menu bar and/or toolbar is shared between all child windows, reducing clutter and increasing efficient use of screen space. This argument is less relevant on an operating system which uses a common menu bar.
* An application&#x27;s child windows can be hidden/shown/minimized/maximized as a whole.
* Features such as &quot;Tile&quot; and &quot;Cascade&quot; can be implemented for the child windows.
* Authors of cross-platform applications can provide their users with consistent application behaviour between platforms.
* If the windowing environment and OS lack good window management, the application author can implement it themselves.
* Modularity: An advanced window manager can be upgraded independently of the applications.

===Disadvantages===
* Without an MDI frame window, floating toolbars from one application can clutter the workspace of other applications, potentially confusing users with the jumble of interfaces.
* Can be tricky to implement on desktops using multiple monitors as the parent window may need to span two or more monitors, hiding sections.
* Virtual desktops cannot be spanned by children of the MDI. However, in some cases, this is solvable by initiating another parent window; this is the case in Opera and Chrome, for example, which allows tabs/child windows to be dragged outside of the parent window to start their own parent window. In other cases, each child window is also a parent window, forming a new, &quot;virtual&quot; MDI .
* MDI can make it more difficult to work with several applications at once, by restricting the ways in which windows from multiple applications can be arranged together without obscuring each other.
* The shared menu might change, which may cause confusion to some users. 
* MDI child windows behave differently from those in single-document interface applications, requiring users to learn two subtly different windowing concepts. Similarly, the MDI parent window behaves like the desktop in many respects, but has enough differences to confuse some users.
* Deeply nested, branching hierarchies of child windows can be confusing.
* Many window managers have built-in support for manipulating groups of separate windows, which is typically more flexible than MDI in that windows can be grouped and ungrouped arbitrarily. A typical policy is to group automatically windows that belong to the same application. This arguably makes MDI redundant by providing a solution to the same problem.
* Controls and hotkeys learned for the MDI application may not apply to others, whereas with an advanced Window Manager, more behavior and user preference settings are shared across client applications on the same system

==Application examples==
* Adobe Acrobat: MDI until version 7.0 (Windows-only); SDI default in 8.0 (configurable to MDI); SDI only in 9.0; MDI (with a tabbed interface) in version 2015.
* Corel Wordperfect: MDI. A user can open multiple instances of WP with a single document in each, if they have multiple versions of WordPerfect installed on their computer. Recent versions maintain a list of open documents for a given window on the status bar at the bottom of the window, providing a variant of the TDI.
* EmEditor: Options for either SDI or MDI.
* GIMP: SDI with floating windows (MDI is available as an option called &quot;Single-Window Mode&quot; since version 2.8 ).
* GIMPshop: A fork of GIMP aiming to be more like Adobe Photoshop. The Windows version has limited MDI.
* Chrome: Combination of MDI and TDI. 
* Internet Explorer 6: a typical SDI application
* KWrite: Another text editor designed for the KDE Software Compilation, with a simplified SDI but sharing many of Kate&#x27;s features via a mutual back end
* Kate: Text editor designed for the KDE Software Compilation, with advanced features and a sophisticated MDI
* Macromedia Studio for Windows: a hybrid interface; TDI unless document windows are un-maximized. (They are maximized by default.)
* Microsoft Excel 2003: SDI if you start new instances of the application, but MDI if you click the &quot;File → New&quot; menu (but child windows optionally appear on the OS taskbar). SDI only as of 2013.
* Microsoft Word 2003: MDI until Microsoft Office 97. After 2000, Word has a Multiple Top-Level Windows Interface, thus exposing to shell individual SDI instances, while the operating system recognizes it as a single instance of an MDI application. In Word 2000, this was the only interface available, but 2002 and later offer MDI as an option. Microsoft Foundation Classes (which Office is loosely based on) supports this metaphor since version 7.0, as a new feature in Visual Studio 2002. SDI only as of 2013.
* Firefox: TDI by default, can be SDI
* Notepad++, PSPad, TextMate and many other text editors: TDI
* Opera: Combination of MDI and TDI (a true MDI interface with a tab bar for quick access).
* Paint.NET: Thumbnail-based, TDI
* UltraEdit: Combination of MDI and TDI (a true MDI interface with a tab bar for quick access).
* VEDIT: Combination of MDI and TDI (a true MDI interface with a tab bar for quick access). Special &quot;Full size&quot; windows act like maximized windows, but allow smaller overlapping windows to be used at the same time. Multiple instances of Vedit can be started, which allows it to be used like an SDI application.
* Visual Studio .NET: MDI or TDI with &quot;Window&quot; menu, but not both
* Visual Studio 6 development environment: a typical modern MDI
* mIRC: MDI by default, can also work on SDI mode
* Adobe Photoshop: MDI under Windows. In newer versions, toolbars can move outside the frame window. Child windows can be outside the frame unless they are minimized or maximized.
==IDE-style interface==
Graphical computer applications with an IDE-style interface (IDE) are those whose child windows reside under a single parent window (usually with the exception of modal windows). An IDE-style interface is distinguishable from the Multiple-Document Interface (MDI), because all child windows in an IDE-style interface are enhanced with added functionality not ordinarily available in MDI applications. Because of this, IDE-style applications can be considered a functional superset and descendant of MDI applications.

Examples of enhanced child-window functionality include:
* Dockable child windows
* Collapsible child windows
* Tabbed document interface for sub-panes
* Independent sub-panes of the parent window
* GUI splitters to resize sub-panes of the parent window
* Persistence for window arrangements

===Collapsible child windows===
A common convention for child windows in IDE-style applications is the ability to collapse child windows, either when inactive, or when specified by the user. Child windows that are collapsed will conform to one of the four outer boundaries of the parent window, with some kind of label or indicator that allows them to be expanded again.

===Tabbed document interface for sub-panes ===
In contrast to (MDI) applications, which ordinarily allow a single tabbed interface for the parent window, applications with an IDE-style interface allow tabs for organizing one or more subpanes of the parent window.

===IDE-style application examples===
* NetBeans
* dBASE
* Eclipse
* Visual Studio 6
* Visual Studio .NET
* Visual Studio Code
* RSS Bandit
* JEdit
* MATLAB
* Microsoft Excel when in MDI mode (see above).

==Macintosh==
MacOS and its GUI are document-centric instead of window-centric or application-centric. Every document window is an object with which the user can work. The menu bar changes to reflect whatever application the front window belongs to. Application windows can be hidden and manipulated as a group, and the user may switch between applications (i.e., groups of windows) or between individual windows, automatically hiding palettes, and most programs will stay running even with no open windows. Indeed, prior to Mac OS X, it was purposely impossible to interleave windows from multiple applications.

In spite of this, some unusual applications breaking the human interface guidelines (most notably Photoshop) do exhibit different behavior.

<text>A microlith is a small stone tool usually made of flint or chert and typically a centimetre or so in length and half a centimetre wide. They were made by humans from around 35,000 years ago, across Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. The microliths were used in spear points and arrowheads.

Microliths are produced from either a small blade (microblade) or a larger blade-like piece of flint by abrupt or truncated retouching, which leaves a very typical piece of waste, called a microburin. The microliths themselves are sufficiently worked so as to be distinguishable from workshop waste or accidents.

Two families of microliths are usually defined: laminar and geometric. An assemblage of microliths can be used to date an archeological site. Laminar microliths are slightly larger, and are associated with the end of the Upper Paleolithic and the beginning of the Epipaleolithic era; geometric microliths are characteristic of the Mesolithic and the Neolithic. Geometric microliths may be triangular, trapezoid or lunate. Microlith production generally declined following the introduction of agriculture (8000 BCE) but continued later in cultures with a deeply rooted hunting tradition.

Regardless of type, microliths were used to form the points of hunting weapons, such as spears and (in later periods) arrows, and other artifacts and are found throughout Africa, Asia and Europe. They were utilised with wood, bone, resin and fiber to form a composite tool or weapon, and traces of wood to which microliths were attached have been found in Sweden, Denmark and England. An average of between six and eighteen microliths may often have been used in one spear or harpoon, but only one or two in an arrow. The shift from earlier larger tools had an advantage. Often the haft of a tool was harder to produce than the point or edge: replacing dull or broken microliths with new easily portable ones was easier than making new hafts or handles.

==Types==
===Laminar and non-geometric microliths===
Laminar microliths date from at least the Gravettian culture or possibly the start of the Upper Paleolithic era, and they are found all through the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras. &quot;Noailles&quot; burins and micro-gravettes indicate that the production of microliths had already started in the Gravettian culture.
This style of flint working flourished during the Magdalenian period and persisted in numerous Epipaleolithic traditions all around the Mediterranean basin. These microliths are slightly larger than the geometric microliths that followed and were made from the flakes of flint obtained &quot;ad hoc&quot; from a small nucleus or from a depleted nucleus of flint. They were produced either by percussion or by the application of a variable pressure (although pressure is the best option, this method of producing microliths is complicated and was not the most commonly used technique).

====Truncated blade====
There are three basic types of laminar microlith. The truncated blade type can be divided into a number of sub-types depending on the position of the truncation (for example, oblique, square or double) and according to its form, for example, concave or convex. &quot;Raclette scrapers&quot; are notable for their particular form, being blades or flakes whose edges have been sharply retouched until they are semicircular or even shapeless. Raclettes are indefinite cultural indicators, as they appear from the Upper Paleolithic through to the Neolithic.

====Backed edge blades====
Backed edge blades have one of the edges, generally a side one, rounded or chamfered by abrupt retouching. There are fewer types of these blades, and may be divided into those where the entire edge is rounded and those where only a part is rounded, or even straight. They are fundamental in the blade-forming processes, and from them, innumerable other types were developed. Dufour bladelets are up to three centimeters in length, finely shaped with a curved profile whose retouches are semi-abrupt and which characterize a particular phase of the Aurignacian period. Solutrean backed edge blades display pronounced and abrupt retouching, so that they are long and narrow and, although rare, characterize certain phases of the Solutrean period. Ouchtata bladelets are similar to the others, except that the retouched back is not uniform but irregular; this type of microlith characterizes certain periods of the Epipaleolithic Saharans. The Ibero-Maurusian and the Montbani bladelet, with a partial and irregular lateral retouching, is characteristic of the Italian Tardenoisian.

====Micro points====
These are very sharp bladelets formed by abrupt retouching. There are a huge number of regional varieties of these microliths, nearly all of which are very hard to distinguish (especially those from the western area) without knowing the archaeological context in which they appear. The following is a small selection. Omitted are the foliaceous tips (also called leafed tips), which are characterized by a covering retouch and which constitute a group apart.
*The &quot;Châtelperrón point&quot; is not a true microlith, although it is close to the required dimensions. Its antiquity and its short, curved blade edge make it the antecedent of many laminar microliths.
*The &quot;Micro-gravette&quot; or &quot;Gravette micro point&quot; is a microlith version of the &quot;Gravette point&quot; and is a narrow bladelet with an abrupt retouch, which gives it a characteristically sharp edge when compared to other types.
*The &quot;Azilian point&quot; links the Magdalenian microlith points with those from the western Epipaleolithic. They can be identified by a rough and invasive retouching.
*The &quot;Ahrensburgian point&quot; is also a &quot;peripheral paleolithic&quot; or western Epipaleolithic piece, but with a more specific morphology, as it is formed on a blade (not on a bladelet), is obliquely truncated and has a small tongue that possibly served as a haft on a spear point.

The next group contains a number of points from the Middle East characterized as cultural markers.
*The Emireh point from the Upper Paleolithic is almost the same as one found in Châtelperrón, which is likely to be contemporary, although they are slightly shorter and also appear to be fashioned from a blade and not a bladelet.
*The &quot;El-Wad point&quot; is from the end of the Upper Paleolithic from the same area, made from a very long, thin bladelet.
*The &quot;El-Khiam point&quot; has been identified by the Spanish archeologist González Echegaray in Protoneolithic sites in Jordan. They are little known but easy to identify by two basal notches, doubtless used as a haft.

The &quot;Adelaide point&quot; is found in Australia. Its construction, based on truncations on a blade, has a nearly trapezoidal form. The Adelaide point emphasizes the range of variation in both time and culture of the laminar microliths; it also shows their technological differences, but sometimes morphological similarities, with geometric microliths. Laminar microliths can also sometimes be described as trapezoidal, triangular or lunate. However, they are distinct from the geometric microliths because of the strokes used in the manufacture of geometric microliths, which mainly involved the microburin technique.

===Geometric microliths===

Geometric microliths are a clearly defined type of stone tool, at least in their basic forms. They can be divided into trapezoid, triangular and lunate (half-moon) forms, although there are many subdivisions of each of these types. A microburin is included among the illustrations below because, although it is not a geometrical microlith (or even a tool), it is now seen as a characteristic waste product from the manufacture of these geometric microliths:
Geometric microliths, though rare, are present as trapezoids in Northwest Africa in the Iberomaurusian. They later appear in Europe in the Magdalenian initially as elongated triangles and later as trapezoids (although the microburin technique is seen from the Perigordian), they are mostly seen during the Epipaleolithic and the Neolithic. They remained in existence even into the Copper Age and Bronze Age, competing with &quot;leafed&quot; and then metallic arrowheads.

====Microburin technique====
All the currently known geometric microliths share the same fundamental characteristics – only their shapes vary. They were all made from blades or from microblades (nearly always of flint), using the microburin technique (which implies that it is not possible to conserve the remains of the heel or the conchoidal flakes from the blank). The pieces were then finished by a percussive retouching of the edges (generally leaving one side with the natural edge of the blank), giving the piece its definitive polygonal form. For example, in order to make a triangle, two adjacent notches were retouched, leaving free the third edge or &quot;base&quot; (using the terminology of Fortea). They generally have one long axis and concave or convex edges, and it is possible for them to have a gibbosity (hump) or indentations. Triangular microliths may be isosceles, scalene or equilateral. In the case of trapezoid geometric microliths, on the other hand, the notches are not retouched, leaving a portion of the natural edge between them. Trapezoids can be further subdivided into symmetrical, asymmetrical and those with concave edges. Lunate microliths have the least diversity of all and may be either semicircular or segmental.

Archeological findings and the analysis of wear marks, or use-wear analysis, has shown that, predictably, the tips of spears, harpoons and other light projectiles of varying size received the most wear. Microliths were also used from the Neolithic on arrows, although a decline in this use coincided with the appearance of bifacial or &quot;leafed&quot; arrowheads that became widespread in the Chalcolithic period, or Copper Age (that is, stone arrowheads were increasingly made by a different technique during this later period).

==Weapons and tools==
Not all the different types of laminar microliths had functions that are clearly understood. It is likely that they contributed to the points of spears or light projectiles, and their small size suggests that they were fixed in some way to a shaft or handle.

Backed edge bladelets are particularly abundant at a site in France that preserves habitation from the late Magdalenian – the Pincevent. In the remains of some of the hearths at this location, bladelets are found in groups of three, perhaps indicating that they were mounted in threes on their handles. A javelin tip made of horn has been found at this site with grooves made for flint bladelets that could have been secured using a resinous substance. Signs of much wear and tear have been found on some of these finds.

Specialists have carried out lithic or microwear analysis on artefacts, but it has sometimes proved difficult to distinguish those fractures made during the process of fashioning the flint implement from those made during its use. Microliths found at Hengistbury Head in Dorset, England, show features that can be confused with chisel marks, but which might also have been produced when the tip hit a hard object and splintered. Microliths from other locations have presented the same problems of interpretation.

An exceptional piece of evidence for the use of microliths has been found in the excavations of the cave at Lascaux in the French Dordogne. Twenty backed edge bladelets were found with the remains of a resinous substance and the imprint of a circular handle (a horn). It appears that the bladelets might have been fixed in groups like the teeth of a harpoon or similar weapon.

In all these locations, the microliths found have been backed edge blades, tips and crude flakes. Despite the great number of geometric microliths that have been found in Western Europe, few examples show any clear evidence of their use, and all the examples are from the Mesolithic or Neolithic periods. Despite this, there is unanimity amongst researchers that these items were used to increase the penetrating potential of light projectiles such as harpoons, assegais, javelins and arrows.

==Discoveries==

=== Australia ===
The most common form of microliths found in Australia are backed artefacts. The earliest backed artefacts have been dated to the terminal Pleistocene, however they become increasingly common in Aboriginal Australian societies in the mid-Holocene, before declining in use and disappearing from the archaeological record approximately 1000 years before the British invasion of the continent in 1788. The cause of this proliferation event is debated amongst archaeologists.

Geographically they are found across almost all of continental Australia, except for the far north, but are particularly common in south-east Australia. Historically, backed artefacts were divided into asymmetrical Bondi points and symmetrical geometric microliths, however there appears to be no geographic or temporal pattern in the distribution of these shapes. Backed artefact manufacturing workshops have been identified at Ngungara show significant variation in shape, which has been linked to the need to replace components of composite tools.

Several studies in the production of backed artefacts have linked identified heat treatment as a key component as well as the use of large flank blanks.

Functional studies of backed artefacts from south-eastern Australia show that they were multipurpose and multifunctional tools with a similar range of uses as unretouched flakes found at the same sites. There is one unambiguous example of them being used as part of composite weapon, either a spear or a club, as 17 backed artefacts were found embedded into the skeleton of an adult male dated to approximately 4000 years BP in the Sydney suburb of Narrabeen.

===France===
In France, one unusual site stands out: the Mesolithic cemetery of Téviec, an island in Brittany. Numerous flint microliths were discovered here. They are believed to date to between 6740 and 5680 years BP - quite a long occupation. The end of the settlement came at the beginning of the Neolithic period.

One of the skeletons that has been found has a geometric microlith lodged in one of its vertebra. All indications suggest that the person died because of this projectile; whether by intention or by accident is unknown. It is widely agreed that geometric microliths were mainly used in hunting and fishing, but they may also have been used as weapons.

===Scandinavia===
Well-preserved examples of arrows with microliths in Scandinavia have been found at Loshult, at Osby in Sweden, and Tværmose, at Vinderup in Denmark. These finds, which have been preserved practically intact due to the special conditions of the peat bogs, have included wooden arrows with microliths attached to the tip by resinous substances and cords.

According to radiocarbon measurements, the Loshult arrows are dated to around 8000 BC, which represents a middle part of the Maglemose culture. This is close to the Early Boreal/Late Boreal transition.

===England===
There are many examples of possible tools from Mesolithic deposits in England. Possibly the best known is a microlith from Star Carr in Yorkshire that retains residues of resin, probably used to fix it to the tip of a projectile. Recent excavations have found other examples. Archeologists at the Risby Warren V site in Lincolnshire have uncovered a row of eight triangular microliths that are equidistantly aligned along a dark stain indicating organic remains (possibly the wood from an arrow shaft). Another clear indication is from the Readycon Dene site in West Yorkshire, where 35 microliths appear to be associated with a single projectile. In Urra Moor, North Yorkshire, 25 microliths give the appearance of being related to one another, due to the extreme regularity and symmetry of their arrangement in the ground.

The study of English and European artifacts in general has revealed that projectiles were made with a widely variable number of microliths: in &quot;Tværmose&quot; there was only one, in &quot;Loshult&quot; there were two (one for the tip and the other as a fin), in White Hassocks, in West Yorkshire, more than 40 have been found together; the average is between 6 and 18 pieces for each projectile.

===India===
Early research regard the microlithic industry in India as a Holocene phenomenon, however a new research provides solid data to put the South Asia microliths industry up to 45 ka across whole South Asia subcontinent. This new research also synthesizes the data from genetic, paleoenvironmental and archaeological research, and proposes that the emergence of microlith in India subcontinent could reflect the increase of population and adaptation of environmental deterioration.

=== Sri Lanka ===
In 1968 human burials sites were uncovered inside the Fa Hien Cave in Sri Lanka. A further excavation in 1988 yielded microlith stone tools, remnants of prehistoric fireplaces and organic material, such as floral and human remains. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the cave had been occupied from about 33,000 years ago, the Late Pleistocene and Mesolithic to 4,750 years ago, the Neolithic in the Middle Holocene. Human remains of the several sediment deposits were analyzed at Cornell University and studied by Kenneth A. R. Kennedy and graduate student Joanne L. Zahorsky. Sri Lanka has yielded the earliest known microliths, which did not appear in Europe until the Early Holocene. 2019 study found Fa-Hien Lena cave microlith assemblage represents the earliest microlith assemblage in South Asia dating back to c. 48,000–45,000 years ago.

==Dating==

Laminar microliths are common artifacts from the Upper Paleolithic and the Epipaleolithic, to such a degree that numerous studies have used them as markers to date different phases of prehistoric cultures.

During the Epipaleolithic and the Mesolithic, the presence of laminar or geometric microliths serves to date the deposits of different cultural traditions. For instance, in the Atlas Mountains of northwest Africa, the end of the Upper Paleolithic period coincides with the end of the Aterian tradition of producing laminar microliths, and deposits can be dated by the presence or absence of these artifacts. In the Near East, the laminar microliths of the Kebarian culture were superseded by the geometric microliths of the Natufian tradition a little more than 11,000 years ago. This pattern is repeated throughout the Mediterranean basin and across Europe in general.

A similar thing is found in England, where the preponderance of elongated microliths, as opposed to other frequently occurring forms, has permitted the Mesolithic to be separated into two phases: the Earlier Mesolithic of about 8300–6700 BCE, or the ancient and laminar Mesolithic, and the Later Mesolithic, or the recent and geometric Mesolithic. Deposits can be thus dated based upon the assemblage of artifacts found.

<text>The menorah (; &quot;mənōrā&quot;, ) is a seven-branched candelabrum that is described in the Hebrew Bible and in later ancient sources as having been used in the Tabernacle and in the Temple in Jerusalem.

Since ancient times, it has served as a symbol representing the Jewish people and Judaism in both the Land of Israel and the Diaspora. It eventually became the State of Israel&#x27;s official emblem after its founding in 1948.

According to the Hebrew Bible, the menorah was made out of pure gold, and the only source of fuel that was allowed to be used to light the lamps was fresh olive oil. The menorah was placed in the Tabernacle. Biblical tradition holds that Solomon&#x27;s Temple was home to ten menorahs, which were later plundered by the Babylonians; the Second Temple is also said to have been home to a menorah. Following the Roman destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple in 70 CE, the menorah was taken to Rome; the Arch of Titus, which still stands today, famously depicts the menorah being carried away by the triumphant Romans along with other spoils of the destroyed temple. The menorah was reportedly taken to Carthage by the Vandals after the sacking of Rome in 455. Byzantine historian Procopius reported that the Byzantine army recovered it in 533 and brought it to Constantinople, then later returned it to Jerusalem, but many other theories have been advanced for its eventual fate, and no clear evidence of its location has been recorded since late antiquity.

The menorah is frequently used as a symbol in Jewish art. There are no representations of the menorah from the First Temple period, but some examples dating from the Second Temple period have been recorded. Menorah images that were discovered include the coins of Antigonus II Mattathias, the last Hasmonean king of Judea, as well as on the walls of an Upper City mansion and Jason&#x27;s Tomb in Jerusalem, and objects such as the Magdala stone. Following the destruction of the Second Temple, the menorah came to be recognized as a distinctively Jewish symbol and was depicted on tomb walls, synagogue floors, sculptures and reliefs, as well as glass and metal objects. The menorah has been also used since then to distinguish synagogues and Jewish cemeteries from the places of worship and cemeteries of Christians and pagans. The symbol has also been found in several archaeological artifacts from ancient Samaritan, Christian and Islamic communities. The Hanukkah menorah, a nine-branched variant of the menorah, is closely associated with the Jewish festival of Hanukkah.

==Construction and appearance==

=== Hebrew Bible ===
The Hebrew Bible states that God revealed the design for the menorah to Moses and describes the construction of the menorah as follows:

31Make a lampstand of pure gold. Hammer out its base and shaft, and make its flowerlike cups, buds and blossoms of one piece with them.
32Six branches are to extend from the sides of the lampstand—three on one side and three on the other.
33Three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms are to be on one branch, three on the next branch, and the same for all six branches extending from the lampstand.
34And on the lampstand are to be four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms.
35One bud shall be under the first pair of branches extending from the lampstand, a second bud under the second pair, and a third bud under the third pair—six branches in all.
36The buds and branches shall be all of one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold.

37Then make its seven lamps and set them up on it so that they light the space in front of it.
38Its wick trimmers and trays are to be of pure gold.
39A talent of pure gold is to be used for the lampstand and all these accessories.
40See that you make them according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.
The Book of Numbers (Chapter 8) adds that the seven lamps are to give light in front of the lampstand and reiterates that the lampstand was made in accordance with the pattern shown to Moses on the mountain.

=== In other sources ===

Rabbinic sources teach that the menorah stood 18 handbreadths/palms (three common cubits) high, or approximately . Although the menorah was placed in the antechamber of the Temple sanctuary, over against its southernmost wall, the Talmud (&quot;Menahot&quot; 98b) brings down a dispute between two scholars on whether or not the menorah was situated north to south, or east to west. The branches are often artistically depicted as semicircular, but Rashi, (according to some contemporary readings) and Maimonides (in a sketch commented on by his son Avraham), held that they were straight; all other Jewish authorities, both classical (e.g. Philo and Josephus) and medieval (e.g. Ibn Ezra), who express an opinion on the subject state that the arms were round.

The Roman-Jewish historian Josephus, who witnessed the Temple&#x27;s destruction, says that the menorah was actually situated obliquely, to the east and south.

==== Arch of Titus ====
The most famous preserved representation of the menorah of the Second Temple was depicted in a frieze on the Arch of Titus, commemorating his triumphal parade in Rome following the destruction of Jerusalem in the year 70 CE. In that frieze, the menorah is shown resting upon a hexagonal base, which in turn rests upon a slightly larger but concentric and identically shaped base; a stepwise appearance on all sides is thus produced. Each facet of the hexagonal base was made with two vertical stiles and two horizontal rails, a top rail and a bottom rail, resembling a protruding frame set against a sunken panel. These panels have some relief design set or sculpted within them.

==== Magdala Stone ====

In 2009, the ruins of a synagogue in Magdala with pottery dating from before the destruction of the Second Temple were discovered under land owned by the Legionaries of Christ, who had intended to construct a center for women&#x27;s studies. Inside that synagogue&#x27;s ruins, a carved stone block was discovered, which had on its surface, among other ornate carvings, a depiction of the seven-lamp menorah differing markedly from the depiction on the Arch of Titus, which could possibly have been carved by an eyewitness to the actual menorah present at the time in the Temple at Jerusalem. This menorah has arms which are polygonal, not rounded, and the base is not graduated but triangular. It is notable, however, that this artifact was found a significant distance from Jerusalem and the Arch of Titus has often been interpreted as an eyewitness account of the original menorah being looted from the temple in Jerusalem.

==Usage==
According to the Book of Exodus, the lamps of the menorah were lit daily from fresh, consecrated olive oil and burned from evening until morning.

Josephus states that three of the seven lamps were allowed to burn during the day also; however, according to one opinion in the Talmud, only the center lamp was left burning all day, into which as much oil was put as into the others. Although all the other lights were extinguished, that light continued burning oil, in spite of the fact that it had been kindled first. This miracle, according to the Talmud, was taken as a sign that the Shechinah rested among Israel. It was called the &quot;ner hama&#x27;aravi&quot; (Western lamp) because of the direction of its wick. This lamp was also referred to as the &quot;ner Elohim&quot; (lamp of God), mentioned in I Samuel 3:3. According to the Talmud, the miracle of the &quot;ner hama&#x27;aravi&quot; ended after the High Priesthood of Simon the Just in the 3rd or 4th century BC.

Contrary to some modern designs, the ancient menorah burned oil and did not contain anything resembling candles, which were unknown in the Middle East until about 400 CE.

==History==
===Tabernacle===
The original menorah was made for the tabernacle, and the Bible records it as being present until the Israelites crossed the Jordan River. When the tabernacle tent was pitched in Shiloh, it is assumed that the menorah was also present. However, no mention is made of it during the years that the Ark of the Covenant was moved in the times of Samuel and Saul.

Benjamin D. Sommer suggests that while the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle was reserved for God’s presence, the main room featured a metal menorah with six branches on each side, potentially echoing the asherah, a sacred tree or pole linked to the goddess Asherah. However, Rachel Hachili argues that theories positing that the menorah had its roots in some kind of sacred tree or plant have several problems.

===Solomon&#x27;s Temple===
According to 2 Kings and the Books of Chronicles, Solomon created ten lampstands (&quot;menorahs&quot;), that were put in the &quot;heikal,&quot; Solomon&#x27;s Temple main chamber. The weight of the lampstands forms part of the detailed instructions given to Solomon by David. According to the Book of Jeremiah, the lampstands were taken away by the Babylonian general Nebuzaradan following the destruction of Jerusalem.

===Second Temple===

During the construction of the Second Temple following the Return to Zion, no mention is made of the return of the menorah but only of &quot;vessels.&quot; The book of Maccabees records that Antiochus IV took away the lampstands (plural) when he pillaged the Temple. The later record of the making of &quot;new holy vessels&quot; may refer to the manufacture of new lampstands. According to the Talmud, the returning Hasmoneans were poor and forced to construct the Menorah out of wood. They later upgraded it to silver and ultimately gold.

===Rome===

The menorah from the Second Temple was carried to Rome after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE at the height of the First Jewish–Roman War. Its fate is recorded by Josephus, who states that it was brought to Rome and carried along during the triumph of Vespasian and Titus. The bas relief on the Arch of Titus in Rome depicts a scene of Roman soldiers carrying away the spoils of the Second Temple, including the menorah.

For centuries, the menorah and the other temple treasures were displayed as war trophies either at the Temple of Peace in Rome, or in the Imperial Palace. It was still there when the city was sacked by Vandals in 455 CE.

===Whereabouts following the Vandal sack of Rome===

The location and state of the Menorah following the Vandal sack of Rome remains a mystery. Many scholars assume that at this point the Menorah left Rome for Carthage and further destinations, but some believe that the Menorah remains in Rome to this day.

# Many scholars consider as fact that the Menorah was carried off by the Vandals during the Sack of Rome in 455 CE, the Menorah and other assorted treasures of the Temple in Jerusalem were taken to Carthage, the capital of the Vandal Kingdom. They were still there when a Byzantine army under General Belisarius captured the city and defeated the Vandals in 533. Belisarius removed the Menorah and the other treasures and brought them to Constantinople as trophies of war. According to Procopius, the Menorah was carried through the streets of Constantinople during Belisarius&#x27; triumphal procession. Procopius adds that Justinian, prompted by superstitious fear that the treasures had been unlucky for Rome and Carthage, sent them back to Jerusalem and the &quot;sanctuaries of the Christians&quot; there. The Menorah was therefore placed in the Nea Church located in the vicinity of what is today the Batei Makhse Square in the Old City. However, no record exists of their arrival there, and there are no indications of pilgrimages to a shrine for the Menorah there. If the Menorah arrived in Jerusalem, it may have been destroyed when Jerusalem was pillaged by the Persians in 614, though legend suggests that it was secreted away by holy men, much as tradition purports the original Menorah was hidden before Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s invasion.
# Legends and theories hypothesize the Menorah may have been melted down or broken into chunks of gold by conquerors, destroyed in a fire, kept at or returned to Constantinople, or lost in a shipwreck. 
# One notable tradition is that the Menorah actually never left Rome with the Vandals. Orthodox Jews often cite as evidence of this the Oral Tradition, where there is a listing of Jewish treasures, which according to Jewish oral tradition are still in Rome, as they have been for centuries. According to a popular interpretation the Vatican has kept the Menorah and the other mentioned Temple treasures hidden for centuries. Some claim that it has been kept in Vatican City, others that it is in the cellars of the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran. The above Oral Tradition is codified in the Avot of Rabbi Natan, one of the minor tractates printed with the Babylonian Talmud.The objects that were crafted, and then hidden away are these: the tent of meeting and the vessels contained therein, the ark and the broken tablets, the container of manna, and the flask of anointing oil, the stick of Aaron and its almonds and flowers, the priestly garments, and the garments of the anointed [high] priest.But, the spice-grinder of the family of Avtinas [used to make the unique incense in the Temple], the [golden] table [of the showbread], &quot;the menorah&quot;, the curtain [that partitioned the holy from the holy-of-holies], and the head-plate are still sitting in Rome.

==Symbolism==
===Judaism===
The menorah symbolized the ideal of universal enlightenment. The idea that the menorah symbolizes wisdom is noted in the Talmud, for example, in the following: &quot;Rabbi Isaac said: He who desires to become wise should incline to the south [when praying]. The symbol [by which to remember this] is that… the Menorah was on the southern side [of the Temple].&quot;

The seven lamps allude to the branches of human knowledge, represented by the six lamps inclined inwards towards, and symbolically guided by, the light of God represented by the central lamp. The menorah also symbolizes the creation in seven days, with the center light representing the Sabbath.

==== Hannukah menorah ====

A nine-branched menorah is also a symbol closely associated with the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah. According to the Talmud, after the Seleucid desecration of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, there was only enough sealed (and therefore not desecrated) consecrated olive oil left to fuel the eternal flame in the Temple for one day. Miraculously, the oil burned for eight days, which was enough time to make new pure oil.

The Talmud states that it is prohibited to use a seven-lamp menorah outside of the Temple. A Hanukkah menorah therefore has eight main branches, plus the raised ninth lamp set apart as the &quot;shamash&quot; (servant) light which is used to kindle the other lights. The word &quot;shamash&quot; was not originally a &quot;Hanukkah word&quot; and only became associated with the holiday in the 16th century although it first appeared in the Mishnah (c. 200 C.E.) and Talmud (c. 500 C.E.). This type of menorah is called a &quot;hanukkiah&quot; in Modern Hebrew.

==== Kabbalah and the symbol of light ====
In Kabbalah &quot;Or Panim&quot; (&quot;the light of the Face&quot;) is a fundamental conception for the process called Tikkun. All the &quot;Kavvanot&quot;, the spiritual measures of faith for the realization of the Kingdom of God, focus on the manifestation of the &quot;Or Panim&quot;; actually darkness is in itself a negative element, that is, it does not give the hope of obtaining complete devotion: &quot;darkness&quot; is like an inaccessible place, darkness conceals the depth of the gaze; in Chassidut &quot;an awakening from below&quot; is the &quot;service&quot; for God, i.e. the Avodah.

During the victory of the Kedushah in Hanukkah, the Kohen Gadol almost declared that &quot;divine light&quot; must triumph. When the risk of &quot;fall&quot; can do the loss of faith in the Jewish religion as the abyss of Israel&#x27;s personal and collective identity, the Kohen Gadol thus insists for the &quot;awakening&quot; of the most distant souls in order to direct them with Kavanah towards the fulfillment of the Mitzvot: &quot;...because the Torah is the light and the Mitzvah is a lamp&quot;.

===Christianity===

The New Testament Book of Revelation refers to a mystery of seven golden lampstands representing seven churches. The messages to the seven churches from Jesus Christ found have at least four applications: (1) a local application to the specific cities and believers in the church; (2) to all the churches of all generations; (3) a prophetic application unveiling seven distinct phases of church history from the days of the apostle John until today; (4) a personal application to individual believers who have ears to hear what the Spirit is saying.

According to Clement of Alexandria and Philo Judaeus, the seven lamps of the golden menorah represented the seven classical planets in this order: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.

It is also said to symbolize the burning bush as seen by Moses on Mount Horeb.Kevin Conner has noted of the original menorah, described in Exodus 25, that each of the six tributary branches coming out of the main shaft was decorated with three sets of &quot;cups... shaped like almond blossoms... a bulb and a flower...&quot; (Exodus 25:33, NASB). This would create three sets of three units on each branch, a total of nine units per branch. The main shaft, however, had four sets of blossoms, bulbs and flowers, making a total of twelve units on the shaft (Exodus 25:34). This would create a total of 66 units, which Conner claims is a picture of the Protestant canon of scripture (containing 66 books). Moreover, Conner notes that the total decorative units on the shaft and three branches equate to 39 (the number of Old Testament books within Protestant versions of the Bible); and the units on the remaining three branches come to 27 (the number of New Testament books). Conner connects this to Bible passages that speak of God&#x27;s word as a light or lamp (e.g. Psalms 119:105; Psalms 119:130; cf. Proverbs 6:23).

In the Byzantine Rite the use of the menorah has been preserved, always standing on or behind the altar in the sanctuary. Though candles may be used, the traditional practice is to use olive oil in the seven-lamp lampstand. There are varying liturgical practices, and usually all seven lamps are lit for the services, though sometimes only the three centermost are lit for the lesser services. If the church does not have a sanctuary lamp the centermost lamp of the seven lamps may remain lit as an eternal flame.

== In art ==

=== Jewish art ===
The use of the temple menorah as an artistic decoration during the Second Temple period and up to the Bar Kokhba revolt is quite rare. Examples were uncovered in burial caves near Mukhmas (ancient Michmas), in the Herodian Quarter in the Old City of Jerusalem, and in Magdala (on the Magdala Stone). The use of menorahs in Jewish art and in particular in Jewish funerary art became much more common in the late Roman and Byzantine periods.

=== Samaritan art ===
The menorah was a distinctive symbol of Samaritan identity during the Byzantine and Islamic periods. Repurposed stone menorah reliefs, some with accompanying plant decorations, have been found in contemporary structures in several villages of ancient Samaria, including Qariyet Hajjah, Kafr Abbush, Kafr Zibad, Kafr Qaddum and Kafr Jit.

==Modern Jewish use==

=== In synagogues ===
Synagogues have a continually lit lamp or light in front of the Torah ark, where the Torah scroll is kept, called the &quot;ner tamid&quot; (eternal light). This lamp represents the continually lit &quot;ner Elohim&quot; of the menorah used in Temple times. In addition, many synagogues display either a menorah or an artistic representation of a menorah.

=== State of Israel ===

A menorah appears in the Emblem of Israel, based on the depiction of the menorah on the Arch of Titus.

=== Temple Institute reconstruction ===
The Temple Institute has created a life-sized menorah, designed by goldsmith Chaim Odem, intended for use in a future Third Temple. The Jerusalem Post describes the menorah as made &quot;according to excruciatingly exacting Biblical specifications and prepared to be pressed into service immediately should the need arise.&quot; The menorah is made of one talent (interpreted as 45 kg) of 24 karat pure gold, hammered out of a single block of solid gold, with decorations based on the depiction of the original in the Arch of Titus and the Temple Institute&#x27;s interpretation of the relevant religious texts.

=== Other modern Jewish uses ===
A menorah appeared on the cap badge of the First Judeans of the Jewish Legion (1919–1921).

Sometimes when teaching learners of the Hebrew language, a chart shaped like the seven-lamp menorah is used to help students remember the role of the &quot;binyanim&quot; of the Hebrew verb.

The menorah is the main element in several Holocaust memorials.

==Similar objects==
The kinara is also, like the menorah, a seven candleholder which is associated with the African American festival of Kwanzaa. One candle is lit on each day of the week-long celebration, in a similar manner as the Hannukah menorah.

In Taoism, the Seven-Star Lamp &quot;qi xing deng&quot; 七星燈 is a seven-lamp oil lamp lit to represent the seven stars of the Northern Dipper. This lampstand is a requirement for all Taoist temples, never to be extinguished. In the first 9 days of the lunar 9th month festival, an oil lamp of nine connected lamps may also be lit to honour both the Northern Dipper and two other assistant stars (collectively known as the Nine Emperor Stars), sons of Dou Mu appointed by the Taoist Trinity (the Three Pure Ones) to hold the Books of Life and Death of humanity. The lamps represent the illumination of the 7 stars, and lighting them are believed to absolve sins while prolonging one&#x27;s lifespan.

==In popular culture==
The menorah features prominently in the 2013 crypto-thriller &quot;The Sword of Moses&quot; by Dominic Selwood. It is also featured in the archaeology novels &quot;Crusader Gold&quot;, by David Gibbins, &quot;The Last Secret of the Temple&quot;, by Paul Sussman, and &quot;The Testament of Elias&quot;, by W.S. Mahler. A menorah can be seen in the movie &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot;, when Charles Xavier reads Erik Lehnsherr&#x27;s mind, searching for a happy memory from his childhood before the Holocaust, and together they see Erik as a young child lighting his first menorah with his mother.

<text>In computing, a pointing device gesture or mouse gesture (or simply gesture) is a way of combining pointing device or finger movements and clicks that the software recognizes as a specific computer event and responds to accordingly. They can be useful for people who have difficulties typing on a keyboard. For example, in a web browser, a user can navigate to the previously viewed page by pressing the right pointing device button, moving the pointing device briefly to the left, then releasing the button.

== History ==
The first pointing device gesture, the &quot;drag&quot;, was introduced by Apple to replace a dedicated &quot;move&quot; button on mice shipped with its Macintosh and Lisa computers. Dragging involves holding down a pointing device button while moving the pointing device; the software interprets this as an action distinct from separate clicking and moving behaviors. Unlike most pointing device gestures, it does not involve the tracing of any particular shape. Although the &quot;drag&quot; behavior has been adopted in a huge variety of software packages, few other gestures have been as successful.

== Current use ==
, most programs do not support gestures other than the drag operation. Each program that recognizes pointing device gestures does so in its own way, sometimes allowing for very short mouse movement distances to be recognized as gestures, and sometimes requiring very precise emulation of a certain movement pattern (e.g. circle). Some implementations allow users to customize these factors.

Some video games have used gestures. For example, in the &quot;&quot; real-time tactics series, originally created by Bungie, players use them to order battlefield units to face in a desired direction. Another game using gestures is Lionhead&#x27;s &quot;Black &amp; White&quot;. The game &quot;Arx Fatalis&quot; uses mouse gestures for drawing runes in the air to cast spells. Several Nintendo Wii games take advantage of such a system. &quot;Ōkami&quot; uses a system similar to mouse gestures; the player can enter a drawing mode in which the shape they create (circle, lightning bolt, line, etc.) performs a function in the game such as creating a bomb or changing the time from night to day. Other examples of computer games that use mouse gestures are &quot;Die by the Sword&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; where basic mouse gestures actually map attack moves and such in real-time combat, along with &quot;MX vs. ATV: Reflex&quot;, which has a control scheme that implements its titular rider &quot;reflex&quot; system with mouse gestures.

The Opera web browser has recognized gestures since version 5.10 (April 2001) but this feature was disabled by default. Opera browser also supports mouse chording which serves a similar function but doesn&#x27;t necessitate mouse movement. The first browser that used advanced mouse gestures (in 2002) was Maxthon, in which a highly customizable interface allowed the assignment of almost every action to one of 52 mouse gestures and few mouse chords. Several mouse gesture extensions are also available for the Mozilla Firefox browser. These extensions use almost identical gestures as Opera.

Some tools provide mouse gestures support in any application for Microsoft Windows. K Desktop Environment 3 includes universal mouse gesture support since version 3.2.

Windows Aero provides three mouse gestures called Aero Peek, Aero Shake and Aero Snap. See the corresponding article for a description.

== Touchpad and touchscreen gestures ==
Touchscreens of tablet-type devices, such as the iPad, utilize multi-touch technology, with gestures acting as the main form of user interface. Many touchpads, which in laptops replace the traditional mouse, have similar gesture support. For example, a common gesture is to use two fingers in a downwards or upwards motion to scroll the currently active page. The rising popularity of touchscreen interfaces has led to gestures becoming a more standard feature in computing. Windows 7 introduced touchscreen support and touchpad gestures. Its successor, Windows 8 is designed to run both on traditional desktops and mobile devices and hence gestures are now enabled by default where the hardware allows it.

Related to gestures are touchpad hotspots, where a particular region of the touchpad has additional functionality. For example, a common hotspot feature is the far right side of the touchpad, which will scroll the active page if a finger is dragged down or up it.

Multi-touch touchscreen gestures are predefined motions used to interact with multi-touch devices. An increasing number of products like smartphones, tablets, laptops or desktop computers have functions that are triggered by multi-touch gestures. Common touchscreen gestures include:

Other gestures including more than 2 fingers on screen have also been developed such as Sticky Tools. These techniques are often developed for 3D applications and are not considered standard.

== Drawbacks ==
A major drawback of current gesture interaction solutions is the lack of support for two necessary user interface design principles, feedback and visibility (or affordance). Feedback notification is required to indicate whether the gesture has been entered correctly by indicating the gesture recognized and the corresponding command activated, although Sensiva does approach this to some extent in providing voice notification. The other principle is visibility of gestures, providing the user some means of learning the necessary gestures and the contexts they can be used in. Both Mouse Gestures for Internet Explorer and ALToolbar Mouse Gestures display colored tracers that indicate the current motion that the user is taking to facilitate visual clues for the user. Pie menus and marking menus have been proposed as solutions for both problems, since they support learning of the available options but can also be used with quick gestures. Most recent versions of Opera (11 and above) uses an on-screen pie menu to simply and instructively display which mouse gestures are available and how to activate them, providing feedback and visibility.

One limitation with gesture interaction is the scope context in which the gestures can be used. For example, each gesture has only one corresponding command for each application window.

Holding down buttons while moving the mouse can be awkward and requires some practice, since the downwards action increases friction for the horizontal motion. An optical mouse would be less susceptible to changes in behavior than a ball mouse with increased friction because the sensor does not rely on mechanical contact to sense movement; a touchpad provides no added friction with all its buttons held down with a thumb. However, it was also argued that muscular tension resulting from holding down buttons could be exploited in user interface design as it gives constant feedback that the user is in a temporary state, or mode (Buxton, 1995).

<doc id="20739" wikidata="Q187934" url="?curid=20739" title="Monorail">
<text>A monorail is a railway in which the track consists of a single rail or beam. Colloquially, the term &quot;monorail&quot; is often used to describe any form of elevated rail or people mover. More accurately, the term refers to the style of track. Monorail systems are most frequently implemented in large cities, airports, and theme parks.

==Etymology==
The term possibly originated in 1897 from German engineer Eugen Langen, who called an elevated railway system with wagons suspended the &quot;Eugen Langen One-railed Suspension Tramway&quot; (Einschieniges Hängebahnsystem Eugen Langen).

==Differentiation from other transport systems==

Monorails have found applications in airport transfers and medium capacity metros. To differentiate monorails from other transport modes, the Monorail Society defines a monorail as a &quot;single rail serving as a track for passenger or freight vehicles. In most cases, rail is elevated, but monorails can also run at grade, below grade, or in subway tunnels. Vehicles either are suspended from or straddle a narrow guide way. Monorail vehicles are wider than the guideway that supports them.&quot;

===Similarities===
Monorails are often elevated, sometimes leading to confusion with other elevated systems such as the Docklands Light Railway, Vancouver SkyTrain, the AirTrain JFK and cable propelled systems like the Cable Liner people mover which run on two rails.

Monorail vehicles often appear similar to light rail vehicles, and can be staffed or unstaffed. They can be individual rigid vehicles, articulated single units, or multiple units coupled into trains. Like other advanced rapid transit systems, monorails can be driven by linear induction motors; like conventional railways, vehicle bodies can be connected to the beam via bogies, allowing curves to be negotiated.

Monorails are sometimes used in urban areas alongside conventional parallel railed metro systems. Mumbai Monorail serves alongside Mumbai Metro, while monorail lines are integrated with conventional rail rapid transit lines in Bangkok&#x27;s MRT network.

===Differences===
Unlike some trams and light rail systems, modern monorails are always separated from other traffic and pedestrians due to the geometry of the rail. They are both guided and supported via interaction with the same single beam, in contrast to other guided systems like rubber-tyred metros, such as the Sapporo Municipal Subway; or guided buses or trams, such as Translohr. Monorails can also use pantographs.

As with other grade-separated transit systems, monorails avoid red lights, intersection turns, and traffic jams. Surface-level trains, buses, automobiles, and pedestrians can collide each one with the other, while vehicles on dedicated, grade-separated rights-of-way such as monorails can collide only with other vehicles on the same system, with much fewer opportunities for collision. As with other elevated transit systems, monorail passengers receive sunlight and views. Monorails can be quieter than diesel buses and trains. They obtain electricity from the track structure, whereas other modes of transit may use either third rail or overhead power lines and poles. Compared to the elevated train systems of New York, Chicago, and elsewhere, a monorail beamway casts a narrow shadow. 

Conversely, monorails can be more expensive than light-rail systems that do not include tunnels. In addition, monorails must either remain above ground or use larger tunnels than conventional rail systems, and they require complex track-switching equipment.

===Maglev===
Under the Monorail Society&#x27;s beam-width criterion, some, but not all, maglev systems are considered monorails, such as the Transrapid and Linimo. Maglevs differ from other monorails in that they do not physically contact the beam while moving.

==History==

===Early years===
The first monorail prototype was made in Russia in 1820 by Ivan Elmanov. Attempts at creating monorail alternatives to conventional railways have been made since the early part of the 19th century.

The Centennial Monorail was featured at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876. Based on its design the Bradford and Foster Brook Railway was built in 1877 and ran for one year from January 1878 until January 1879.

Around 1879 a &quot;one-rail&quot; system was proposed independently by Haddon and by Stringfellow, which used an inverted &quot;V&quot; rail (and thus shaped like &quot;Λ&quot; in cross-section). It was intended for military use, but was also seen to have civilian use as a &quot;cheap railway.&quot; Similarly, one of the first systems put into practical use was that of French engineer Charles Lartigue, who built a line between Ballybunion and Listowel in Ireland, opened in 1888 and lasting 36 years, being closed in 1924 (due to damage from Ireland&#x27;s Civil War). It used a load-bearing single rail and two lower, external rails for balance, the three carried on triangular supports. It was cheap to construct but tricky to operate. Possibly the first monorail locomotive was a 0-3-0 steam locomotive on this line. A high-speed monorail using the Lartigue system was proposed in 1901 between Liverpool and Manchester.

The Boynton Bicycle Railroad was a steam-powered monorail in Brooklyn on Long Island, New York. It ran on a single load-bearing rail at ground level, but with a wooden overhead stabilising rail engaged by a pair of horizontally opposed wheels. The railway operated for only two years beginning in 1890.

The Hotchkiss Bicycle Railroad was a monorail on which a matching pedal bicycle could be ridden. The first example was built between Smithville and Mount Holly, New Jersey, in 1892. It closed in 1897. Other examples were built in Norfolk from 1895 to 1909, Great Yarmouth, and Blackpool, UK from 1896.

===1900s–1950s===
Early designs used a double-flanged single metal rail alternative to the double rail of conventional railways, both guiding and supporting the monorail car. A surviving suspended version is the oldest still in service system: the Wuppertal monorail in Germany. Also in the early 1900s, Gyro monorails with cars gyroscopically balanced on top of a single rail were tested, but never developed beyond the prototype stage. The Ewing System, used in the Patiala State Monorail Trainways in Punjab, India, relies on a hybrid model with a load-bearing single rail and an external wheel for balance. A highspeed monorail using the Lartigue system was proposed in 1901 between Liverpool and Manchester.

In 1910, the Brennan gyroscopic monorail was considered for use to a coal mine in Alaska. In June 1920, the French Patent Office published FR 503782, by Henri Coanda, on a &#x27;Transporteur Aérien&#x27; -Air Carrier. One of the first monorails planned in the United States was in New York City in the early 1930s, scrubbed for an elevated train system.
The first half of the 20th century saw many further proposed designs that either never left the drawing board or remained short-lived prototypes. One of the most interesting projects created on the layout was the ball-bearing train by Nikolai Grigorievich Yarmolchuk. This train moved on spherical wheels with electric motors embedded in them, which were located in semi-circular chutes under a wooden platform (in the full-scale project the trestle would have been concrete). A model train, built to 1/5 scale to test the vehicle concept, was capable of reaching speeds of up to 70 km/h. The full-scale project was expected to reach speeds of up to 300 km/h.

===1950s–1980s===

In the latter half of the 20th century, monorails had settled on using larger beam- or girder-based track, with vehicles supported by one set of wheels and guided by another. In the 1950s, a 40% scale prototype of a system designed for speed of on straight stretches and on curves was built in Germany. There were designs with vehicles supported, suspended or cantilevered from the beams. In the 1950s the ALWEG straddle design emerged, followed by an updated suspended type, the SAFEGE system. Versions of ALWEG&#x27;s technology are used by the two largest monorail manufacturers, Hitachi Monorail and Bombardier.
In 1956, the first monorail to operate in the US began test operations in Houston, Texas. Disneyland in Anaheim, California, opened the United States&#x27; first daily operating monorail system in 1959. Later during this period, additional monorails were installed at Walt Disney World in Florida, Seattle, and in Japan. Monorails were promoted as futuristic technology with exhibition installations and amusement park purchases, as seen by the legacy systems in use today. However, monorails gained little foothold compared to conventional transport systems. In March 1972, Alejandro Goicoechea-Omar had patent DE1755198 published, on a &#x27;Vertebrate Train&#x27;, build as experimental track in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.
Niche private enterprise uses for monorails emerged, with the emergence of air travel and shopping malls, with shuttle-type systems being built.

===1980&#x27;s–present===

From the 1980s, most monorail mass transit systems are in Japan, with a few exceptions. Tokyo Monorail, is one of the world&#x27;s busiest, averages 127,000 passengers per day and has served over 1.5 billion passengers since 1964. China recently started development of monorails in the late 2000s, already home to the world&#x27;s largest and busiest monorail system and has a number of mass transit monorails under construction in several of cities. A Bombardier Innovia Monorail-based system is under construction in Wuhu and several &quot;Cloudrail&quot; systems developed by BYD under construction a number of cities such as Guang&#x27;an, Liuzhou, Bengbu and Guilin. Monorails have seen continuing use in niche shuttle markets and amusement parks.

Modern mass transit monorail systems use developments of the ALWEG beam and tyre approach, with only two suspended types in large use. Monorail configurations have also been adopted by maglev trains. Since the 2000s, with the rise of traffic congestion and urbanization, there has been a resurgence of interest in the technology for public transport with a number of cities, such as Malta and Istanbul, today investigating monorails as a possible mass transit solution.

In 2004, Chongqing Rail Transit in China adopted a unique ALWEG-based design with rolling stock that is much wider than most monorails, with capacity comparable to heavy rail. This is because Chongqing is criss-crossed by numerous hills, mountains and rivers, therefore tunneling is not feasible except in some cases (for example, lines 1 and 6) due to the extreme depth involved. Today it is the largest and busiest monorail system in the world.

In July 2009, two Walt Disney World monorails collided, killing one of the drivers and injuring seven passengers. The National Transportation Safety Board found the cause of the accident to be human error by both the driver and controller, contributed to by a lack of standard operating procedures.

São Paulo, Brazil, is building two high-capacity monorail lines as part of its public transportation network. Line 15 was partially opened in 2014, will be long when completed in 2022 and has a capacity of 40,000 pphpd using Bombardier Innovia Monorail trains. Line 17 will be long and is using the BYD SkyRail design. Other significant monorail systems are under construction such as two lines for the Cairo Monorail, two lines for the MRT (Bangkok) and the SkyRail Bahia in Brazil.

==Types and technical aspects==

Modern monorails depend on a large solid beam as the vehicles&#x27; running surface. There are a number of competing designs divided into two broad classes, &quot;straddle-beam&quot; and &quot;suspended&quot; monorails. The most common type is the straddle-beam, in which the train straddles a steel or reinforced concrete beam wide. A rubber-tired carriage contacts the beam on the top and both sides for traction and to stabilize the vehicle. The style was popularized by the German company ALWEG. There is also a historical type of &quot;suspension monorail&quot; developed by German inventors Nicolaus Otto and Eugen Langen in the 1880s. It was built in the twin cities of Barmen and Elberfeld in Wuppertal, Germany, opened in 1901, and is still in operation. The Chiba Urban Monorail is the world&#x27;s largest suspended network.

===Power===
Almost all modern monorails are powered by electric motors fed by dual third rails, contact wires or electrified channels attached to or enclosed in their guidance beams, but diesel-powered monorail systems also exist. Historically some systems, such as the Lartigue Monorail, used steam locomotives.

===Magnetic levitation===

Magnetic levitation train (maglev) systems such as the German Transrapid were built as straddle-type monorails. The Shanghai Maglev Train runs in commercial operation at , and there are also slower maglev monorails intended for urban transport in Japan (Linimo), Korea (Incheon Airport Maglev) and China (Beijing Subway Line S1 and the Changsha Maglev Express). However, it is argued that the larger width of the guideway for the maglevs makes it not legitimate to be called monorails.

===Switching===

Some early monorails (notably the suspended monorail at Wuppertal, Germany) have a design that makes it difficult to switch from one line to another. Some other monorails avoid switching as much as possible by operating in a continuous loop or between two fixed stations, as in the Seattle Center Monorail.

Current monorails are capable of more efficient switching than in the past. With suspended monorails, switching may be accomplished by moving flanges inside the beamway to shift trains to one line or another.
Straddle-beam monorails require that the beam moves for switching, which was an almost prohibitively ponderous procedure. Now the most common way of achieving this is to place a moving apparatus on top of a sturdy platform capable of bearing the weight of vehicles, beams and its own mechanism. Multiple-segmented beams move into place on rollers to smoothly align one beam with another to send the train in its desired direction, with the design originally developed by ALWEG capable of completing a switch in 12 seconds. Some of these beam turnouts are quite elaborate, capable of switching between several beams or simulating a railroad double-crossover. Vehicle specifications are generally not open to the public, as is standard for rolling stock built for public services.

An alternative to using a wye or other form of switch, is to use a turntable, where a car sits upon a section of track that can be reoriented to several different tracks. For example, this can be used to switch a car from being in a storage location, to being on the main line. The now-closed Sydney Monorail had a traverser at the depot, which allowed a train on the main line to be exchanged with another from the depot. There were about six lines in the depot, including one for maintenance.

===Grades===
Rubber-tired monorails are typically designed to cope with a 6% grade. Rubber-tired light rail or metro lines can cope with similar or greater grades – for example, the Lausanne Metro has grades of up to 12% and the Montreal Metro up to 6.5%, while VAL systems can handle 7% grades.

==Monorail systems==

Manufacturers of monorail rolling stock with operating systems include Hitachi Monorail, BYD, Bombardier Transportation (now Alstom), Scomi, PBTS (a joint venture of CRRC Nanjing Puzhen &amp; Bombardier), Intamin and EMTC.

Other developers include CRRC Qingdao Sifang, China Railway Science and Industry Group, Zhongtang Air Rail Technology, Woojin and SkyWay Group.

==In popular culture==

François Truffaut&#x27;s 1966 film adaptation of Ray Bradbury&#x27;s 1953 novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; contains suspended monorail exterior scenes filmed at the French SAFEGE test track in Châteauneuf-sur-Loire near Orléans, France (since dismantled).

The &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; February 1966 episode &quot;Brink of Disaster&quot; is about the financing and building of a high speed driverless cross-country monorail project. Two of the Thunderbirds-crew find themselves trapped on board the a monorail train, and with no possibility of escape, when it is discovered it is speeding towards a stricken bridge.

The James Bond film franchise features monorails in three movies, all belonging to the villain. In &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967) there is a working ground level monorail inside the SPECTRE volcano base. During &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973), a prop monorail is shown in the villain&#x27;s lair on the fictional Caribbean island of San Monique. In the 1977 &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; there is working monorail on the villain&#x27;s &quot;supertanker&quot; (submarine dock).

In 1987, Lego released a monorail among the &quot;Futuron&quot; Space line. Despite being the most expensive Lego set of its time (due to being massive and including electrical elements), it was very popular, with Lego releasing a &quot;Town&quot; themed monorail in 1990 and another Space monorail in 1994 among the &quot;Unitron&quot; line, as well as additional track. The monorail system was also prominent in the unreleased &quot;Seatron&quot; Space line and prototype &quot;Wild West&quot; sets. Its popularity has still endured over thirty years later, where Lego has paid homage in promotional sets and fans have manufactured compatible components.

The fourth season of the American animated television show &quot;The Simpsons&quot; features the episode &quot;Marge vs. the Monorail&quot;, in which the town of Springfield impulsively purchases a faulty monorail from a confidence trickster at a wildly inflated price. The Monorail Society, an organization with 14,000 members worldwide, has blamed the episode for sullying the reputation of monorails, to which &quot;Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening responded &quot;That&#x27;s a by-product of our viciousness...Monorails are great, so it makes me sad, but at the same time if something&#x27;s going to happen in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, it&#x27;s going to go wrong, right?&quot;

The 2005 feature film &quot;Batman Begins&quot; features a monorail, constructed by Bruce Wayne&#x27;s father through Gotham City, that is part of the climax of the film. The monorail is also included in the spin-off video game.

Blaine the Mono is a train featured in Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series of books and first appears in &quot;The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands&quot;.

Monorails have also appeared in a number of other video games including &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot; (since 1999), &quot;Japanese Rail Sim 3D: Monorail Trip to Okinawa&quot; by Sonic Powered, &quot;SimCity 4: Rush Hour&quot;, &quot;Cities in Motion 2&quot;, &quot;&quot; in the &quot;Mass transit&quot; expansion pack of 2017, &quot;Planet Zoo&quot; and a rideable elevated monorail system in the 2020 video game &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot;. 

===Perceptions of monorail as public transport===
From 1950 to 1980, the monorail concept may have suffered, as with all public transport systems, from competition with the automobile. At the time, the post–World War II optimism in America was riding high and people were buying automobiles in large numbers due to suburbanization and the Interstate Highway System. Monorails in particular may have suffered from the reluctance of public transit authorities to invest in the perceived high cost of un-proven technology when faced with cheaper mature alternatives. There were also many competing monorail technologies, splitting their case further. One notable example of a public monorail is the AMF Monorail that was used as transportation around the 1964–1965 World&#x27;s Fair.

This high-cost perception was challenged most notably in 1963 when the ALWEG consortium proposed to finance the construction of a major system in Los Angeles County, California, in return for the right of operation. This was turned down by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors under pressure from Standard Oil of California and General Motors (which were strong advocates for automobile dependency), and the later proposed subway system faced criticism by famed author Ray Bradbury as it had yet to reach the scale of the proposed monorail.

Several monorails initially conceived as transport systems survive on revenues generated from tourism, benefiting from the unique views offered from the largely elevated installations.

==Farm, mining and logistics applications==

Monorails have been used for number of applications other than passenger transportation. Small suspended monorail are also widely used in factories either as part of moveable assembly lines.

=== History ===
Inspired by the Centennial Monorail demonstrated in 1876, in 1877 the Bradford and Foster Brook Railway began construction of a line connecting Bradford and Foster Township, McKean County in Pennsylvania. The line operated from 1878 until 1879 delivering machinery and oil supplies. The first twin-boiler locomotive wore out quickly. It was replaced by a single boiler locomotive which was too heavy and crashed through the track on its third trip. The third locomotive again had twin boilers. On a trial run one of the boilers ran dry and exploded, killing six people. The railway was closed soon after.
Monorails in Central Java were used to transport timber from the forests of Central Java located in the mountains to the rivers. In 1908 and 1909, the forester H. J. L. Beck built a manually operated monorail of limited but sufficient capacity for the transport of small timber and firewood in the Northern Surabaya forest district. In later years, this idea was further developed by L. A. van de Ven, who was a forester in the Grobogan forest district around 1908–1910. Monorails were built by plantation operators and wood processing companies throughout the mountains of Central Java. In 1919/1920, however, the hand-operated monorails gradually disappeared and were replaced by narrow-gauge railways with steam locomotives as forest utilization changed.

In the 1920s the Port of Hamburg used a petrol powered, suspended monorail to transport luggage and freight from ocean-going vessels to a passenger depot.

In the northern Mojave Desert, the Epsom Salts Monorail was built in 1924. It ran for 28 miles from a connection on the Trona Railway, eastward to harvest epsomite deposits in the Owlshead Mountains. This Lartigue type monorail achieved gradients of up to ten percent. It only operated until June 1926, when the mineral deposits become uneconomic, and was dismantled for scrap in the late 1930s.

In the Soviet Union the Lyskovsky monorail in the Nizhny Novgorod region was designed by the engineer of the timber industry Ivan Gorodtsov. A Lartigue type line of about long was opened in November 1934 to connect the village of Selskaya Maza with the villages of Bakaldy and Yaloksha to carry timber. Following this example a separate cargo-and-passenger monorail was built from the town of Bor to the village of Zavrazhnoe, where forest and peat were exploited. The Lyskovsky monorail stopped operating in 1949.

The British firm &quot;Road Machines (Drayton) Ltd&quot; developed a modular-track ground-level monorail system with a high rail segments, long, running between support plates. The first system was sold in 1949 and it was used in industrial, construction and agricultural applications around the world. The company ceased trading in 1967. The system was adapted for the use in the 1967 James Bond film &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;. An example of the system exists at the Amberley Museum &amp; Heritage Centre in Britain.

=== Recent applications ===

Very small and lightweight systems are used widely on farms to transport crops such as bananas. First developed in Japan, industrial versions of slope cars are used in agriculture in steep sloped areas such as citrus orchards in Japan and vineyards in Italy. One European manufacturer says they have installed 650 systems worldwide.

In the mining industry suspended monorails have been used because of their ability to descend and climb steep tunnels using rack and pinion drive. This significantly reduces cost and length of tunnels, by up to 60% in some cases, which otherwise must be at gentle gradients to suit road vehicles or conventional railways.

A suspended monorail capable of carrying fully loaded 20&#x27; and 40&#x27; containers has been under construction since 2020 at the Port of Qingdao, the first phase of which was put into operation in 2021.

<text>Michael Alexander Kirkwood Halliday (often M. A. K. Halliday; 13 April 1925 – 15 April 2018) was a British linguist who developed the internationally influential systemic functional linguistics (SFL) model of language. His grammatical descriptions go by the name of systemic functional grammar. Halliday described language as a semiotic system, &quot;not in the sense of a system of signs, but a systemic resource for meaning&quot;. For Halliday, language was a &quot;meaning potential&quot;; by extension, he defined linguistics as the study of &quot;how people exchange meanings by &#x27;languaging&#x27;&quot;. Halliday described himself as a &quot;generalist&quot;, meaning that he tried &quot;to look at language from every possible vantage point&quot;, and has described his work as &quot;wander[ing] the highways and byways of language&quot;. But he said that &quot;to the extent that I favoured any one angle, it was the social: language as the creature and creator of human society&quot;.

Halliday&#x27;s grammar differs markedly from traditional accounts that emphasise the classification of individual words (e.g. noun, verb, pronoun, preposition) in formal, written sentences in a restricted number of &quot;valued&quot; varieties of English. Halliday&#x27;s model conceives grammar explicitly as how meanings are coded into wordings, in both spoken and written modes in all varieties and registers of a language. Three strands of grammar operate simultaneously. They concern (i) the interpersonal exchange between speaker and listener, and writer and reader; (ii) representation of our outer and inner worlds; and (iii) the wording of these meanings in cohesive spoken and written texts, from within the clause up to whole texts. Notably, the grammar embraces intonation in spoken language. Halliday&#x27;s seminal &quot;Introduction to Functional Grammar&quot; (first edition, 1985) spawned a new research discipline and related pedagogical approaches. By far the most progress has been made in English, but the international growth of communities of SFL scholars has led to the adaptation of Halliday&#x27;s advances to some other languages.

==Biography==
Halliday was born and raised in England. His parents nurtured his fascination for language: his mother, Winifred, had studied French, and his father, Wilfred, was a dialectologist, a dialect poet, and an English teacher with a love for grammar and Elizabethan drama. In 1942, Halliday volunteered for the National Services&#x27; foreign language training course. He was selected to study Chinese on the strength of his success in being able to differentiate tones. After 18 months&#x27; training, he spent a year in India working with the Chinese Intelligence Unit doing counter-intelligence work. In 1945 he was brought back to London to teach Chinese. He took a BA honours degree in modern Chinese language and literature (Mandarin) through the University of London—an external degree for which he studied in China. He then lived for three years in China, where he studied under Luo Changpei at Peking University and under Wang Li at Lingnan University, before returning to take a PhD in Chinese linguistics at Cambridge under the supervision of Gustav Hallam and then J.R. Firth. Having taught languages for 13 years, he changed his field of specialisation to linguistics, and developed systemic functional linguistics, including systemic functional grammar, elaborating on the foundations laid by his British teacher J.R. Firth and a group of European linguists of the early 20th century, the :Prague school. His seminal paper on this model was published in 1961.

Halliday&#x27;s first academic position was as an assistant lecturer in Chinese, at Cambridge University, from 1954 to 1958. In 1958 he moved to the University of Edinburgh, where he was a lecturer in general linguistics until 1960, and a reader from 1960 to 1963. From 1963 to 1965 he was the director of the Communication Research Centre at University College, London. During 1964, he was also a Linguistic Society of America Professor, at Indiana University. From 1965 to 1971 he was a professor of linguistics at UCL. In 1972–73 he was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioural Sciences, Stanford, and in 1973–74 professor of linguistics at the University of Illinois. In 1974 he briefly moved back to Britain to be a professor of language and linguistics at Essex University. In 1976 he moved to Australia as a foundation professor of linguistics at the University of Sydney, where he remained until he retired in 1987.

Halliday worked in multiple areas of linguistics, both theoretical and applied and was especially concerned with applying the understanding of the basic principles of language to the theory and practices of education. In 1987 he was awarded the status of Emeritus Professor at the University of Sydney and Macquarie University, Sydney. He has honorary doctorates from the University of Birmingham (1987), York University (1988), the University of Athens (1995), Macquarie University (1996), Lingnan University (1999) and Beijing Normal University(2011).

He died in Sydney of natural causes on 15 April 2018 at the age of 93.

==Linguistic theory and description==
Halliday&#x27;s grammatical theory and descriptions gained wide recognition after the publication of the first edition of his book &quot;An Introduction to Functional Grammar&quot; in 1985. A second edition was published in 1994, and then a third, in which he collaborated with Christian Matthiessen, in 2004. A fourth edition was published in 2014. Halliday&#x27;s conception of grammar – or &quot;lexicogrammar&quot;, a term he coined to argue that lexis and grammar are part of the same phenomenon – is based on a more general theory of language as a social semiotic resource, or &quot;meaning potential&quot; (see Systemic functional linguistics). Halliday follows Hjelmslev and Firth in distinguishing theoretical from descriptive categories in linguistics. He argues that &quot;theoretical categories, and their inter-relations, construe an abstract model of language ... they are interlocking and mutually defining. The theoretical architecture derives from work on the description of natural discourse, and as such &#x27;no very clear line is drawn between &#x27;(theoretical) linguistics&#x27; and &#x27;applied linguistics&#x27;&quot;. So the theory &quot;is continually evolving as it is brought to bear on solving problems of a research or practical nature&quot;. Halliday contrasts theoretical categories with descriptive categories, defined as &quot;categories set up in the description of particular languages&quot;. His descriptive work has focused on English and Mandarin.

Halliday argues against some claims about language associated with the generative tradition. Language, he argues, &quot;cannot be equated with &#x27;the set of all grammatical sentences&#x27;, whether that set is conceived of as finite or infinite&quot;. He rejects the use of formal logic in linguistic theories as &quot;irrelevant to the understanding of language&quot; and the use of such approaches as &quot;disastrous for linguistics&quot;. On Chomsky specifically, he writes that &quot;imaginary problems were created by the whole series of dichotomies that Chomsky introduced, or took over unproblematized: not only syntax/semantics but also grammar/lexis, language/thought, competence/performance. Once these dichotomies had been set up, the problem arose of locating and maintaining the boundaries between them.&quot;

==Studies of grammar==

=== Fundamental categories ===
Halliday&#x27;s first major work on grammar was &quot;Categories of the Theory of Grammar&quot;, in the journal &quot;Word&quot; in 1961. In this paper, he argued for four &quot;fundamental categories&quot; in grammar: &quot;unit&quot;, &quot;structure&quot;, &quot;class&quot;, and &quot;system&quot;. These categories are &quot;of the highest order of abstraction&quot;, but he defended them as necessary to &quot;make possible a coherent account of what grammar is and of its place in language&quot; In articulating unit, Halliday proposed the notion of a &quot;rank scale&quot;. The units of grammar form a hierarchy, a scale from largest to smallest, which he proposed as a &quot;sentence&quot;, &quot;clause&quot;, &quot;group/phrase&quot;, &quot;word,&quot; and &quot;morpheme&quot;. Halliday defined structure as &quot;likeness between events in successivity&quot; and as &quot;an arrangement of elements ordered in places&quot;. He rejects a view of the structure as &quot;strings of classes, such as nominal group + verbalgroup + nominal group&quot;, describing structure instead as &quot;configurations of functions, where the solidarity is organic&quot;.

===Grammar as systemic===
Halliday&#x27;s early paper shows that the notion of &quot;system&quot; has been part of his theory from its origins. Halliday explains this preoccupation in the following way: &quot;It seemed to me that explanations of linguistic phenomena needed to be sought in relationships among systems rather than among structures – in what I once called &quot;deep paradigms&quot; – since these were essentially where speakers made their choices&quot;. Halliday&#x27;s &quot;systemic grammar&quot; is a semiotic account of grammar, because of this orientation to choice. Every linguistic act involves choice, and choices are made on many scales. Systemic grammars draw on system networks as their primary representation tool as a consequence. For instance, a major clause must display some structure that is the formal realisation of a choice from the system of &quot;voice&quot;, i.e. it must be either &quot;middle&quot; or &quot;effective&quot;, where &quot;effective&quot; leads to the further choice of &quot;operative&quot; (otherwise known as &#x27;active&#x27;) or &quot;receptive&quot; (otherwise known as &quot;passive&quot;).

===Grammar as functional===
Halliday&#x27;s grammar is not just &quot;systemic&quot;, but &quot;systemic functional&quot;. He argues that the explanation of how language works &quot;needed to be grounded in a functional analysis since language had evolved in the process of carrying out certain critical functions as human beings interacted with their ... &#x27;eco-social&#x27; environment&quot;. Halliday&#x27;s early grammatical descriptions of English, called &quot;Notes on Transitivity and Theme in English – Parts 1–3&quot; include reference to &quot;four components in the grammar of English representing four functions that the language as a communication system is required to carry out: the experiential, the logical, the discoursal and the speech functional or interpersonal&quot;. The &quot;discoursal&quot; function was renamed the &quot;textual function&quot;. In this discussion of functions of language, Halliday draws on the work of Bühler and Malinowski. Halliday&#x27;s notion of language functions, or &quot;metafunctions&quot;, became part of his general linguistic theory.

==Language in society==
The final volume of Halliday&#x27;s 10 volumes of Collected Papers is called &quot;Language in society&quot;, reflecting his theoretical and methodological connection to language as first and foremost concerned with &quot;acts of meaning&quot;. This volume contains many of his early papers, in which he argues for a deep connection between language and social structure. Halliday argues that language does not exist merely to reflect social structure. For instance, he writes:
==Studies in child language development==
In enumerating his claims about the trajectory of children&#x27;s language development, Halliday eschews the metaphor of &quot;acquisition&quot;, in which language is considered a static product that the child takes on when sufficient exposure to natural language enables &quot;parameter setting&quot;. By contrast, for Halliday what the child develops is a &quot;meaning potential&quot;. Learning language is &quot;Learning how to mean&quot;, the name of his well-known early study of a child&#x27;s language development.

Halliday (1975) identifies seven functions that language has for children in their early years. For Halliday, children are motivated to develop language because it serves certain purposes or functions for them. The first four functions help the child to satisfy physical, emotional, and social needs. Halliday calls them instrumental, regulatory, interactional, and personal functions.

* Instrumental: This is when children use language to express their needs (e.g. &quot;Want juice&quot;)
* Regulatory: This is where language is used to tell others what to do (e.g. &quot;Go away&quot;)
* Interactional: Here language is used to make contact with others and form relationships (e.g. &quot;Love you, Mummy&quot;)
* Personal: This is the use of language to express feelings, opinions, and individual identity (e.g. &quot;Me good girl&quot;)

The next three functions are heuristic, imaginative, and representational, all helping the child to come to terms with his or her environment.

* Heuristic: This is when language is used to gain knowledge about the environment (e.g. &#x27;What is the tractor doing?&#x27;)
* Imaginative: Here language is used to tell stories and jokes and to create an imaginary environment.
* Representational: The use of language to convey facts and information.

According to Halliday, as the child moves into the mother tongue, these functions give way to the generalised &quot;metafunctions&quot; of language. In this process, in between the two levels of the simple protolanguage system (the &quot;expression&quot; and &quot;content&quot; pairing of the Saussure&#x27;s sign), an additional level of content is inserted. Instead of one level of content, there are now two: lexicogrammar and semantics. The &quot;expression&quot; plane also now consists of two levels: phonetics and phonology.

Halliday&#x27;s work is sometimes seen as representing a competing viewpoint to the formalist approach of Noam Chomsky. Halliday&#x27;s stated concern is with &quot;naturally occurring language in actual contexts of use&quot; in a large typological range of languages. Critics of Chomsky often characterise his work, by contrast, as focused on English with Platonic idealisation, a characterisation that Chomskyans reject (see Universal Grammar).

==Ordered typology of systems==
Halliday proposed an ordered typology of systems to account for different types of complex systems operating in different phenomenal realms.

He proposed four types of system, in order of increasing complexity—systems of a higher order encompass systems of a lower order:

* Material systems:

# Physical systems: First-order systems, the oldest and widest type of system, having emerged with the Big Bang. They are organized by composition and governed by the laws of physics.
# Biological systems: Second-order systems. They are defined as physical systems plus life, making individuation and evolution possible. They are organized by functional composition (e.g. an organ is a group of tissues serving a similar function).

* Immaterial systems:
# Social systems: Third-order systems. They are biological systems plus social order (or value), organizing biological populations (human or otherwise) into social groups and defining the division of labour among them.
# Semiotic systems: Fourth order systems. They are social systems plus meaning, such as verbal language, gesture, posture, dress, painting, architecture, etc. They further divide into primary semiotic systems, which can only carry meaning, and high-order semiotic systems, which can create meaning.

<text>The Society of the Muslim Brothers (&quot; &quot;), better known as the Muslim Brotherhood ( &quot;&quot;) is a transnational Sunni Islamist organization founded in Egypt by Islamic scholar and schoolteacher Hassan al-Banna in 1928. Al-Banna&#x27;s teachings spread far beyond Egypt, influencing various Islamist movements from charitable organizations to political parties.

Initially, as a Pan-Islamic, religious, and social movement, it preached Islam in Egypt, taught the illiterate, and set up hospitals and business enterprises. It later advanced into the political arena, aiming to end British colonial control of Egypt. The movement&#x27;s self-stated aim is the establishment of a state ruled by sharia law under a caliphate–its most famous slogan is &quot;Islam is the solution&quot;. Charity is a major aspect of its work.

The group spread to other Muslim countries but still has one of its largest organizations in Egypt, despite a succession of government crackdowns since 1948. It remained a fringe group in the politics of the Arab World until the 1967 Six-Day War, when Islamism managed to replace popular secular Arab nationalism after a resounding Arab defeat by Israel. The movement was also supported by Saudi Arabia, with which it shared mutual enemies like communism.

The Arab Spring brought it legalization and substantial political power at first, but as of 2013 it has suffered severe reversals. The Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood was legalized in 2011 and won several elections, including the 2012 presidential election when its candidate Mohamed Morsi became Egypt&#x27;s first president to gain power through an election. A year later, following massive demonstrations and unrest, he was overthrown by the military and placed under house arrest; with a later review finding that the group failed to moderate its views or embrace democratic values during its time in power. The group was then banned in Egypt and declared a terrorist organization. The Persian Gulf monarchies of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates followed suit, driven by the perception that the Brotherhood is a threat to their authoritarian rule.

The group&#x27;s founder accepted the utility of political violence and members of Brotherhood conducted assassinations and attempted assassinations on Egyptian state figures during his lifetime, including Egyptian Prime Minister Mahmud El Nokrashi in 1948. Sayyid Qutb, one of the group&#x27;s most prominent thinkers, promoted takfirism in &quot;Ma&#x27;alim fi-l-Tariq&quot; (&quot;Milestones&quot;), a doctrine that permits &quot;the stigmatisation of other Muslims as infidel or apostate, and of existing states as unIslamic, and the use of extreme violence in the pursuit of the perfect Islamic society&quot;; this doctrine continues to inspire many Jihadist movements. The group abandoned the use of violence in the 1970s. However, Hamas, a Palestinian militant group that controls the Gaza Strip, is an off-shoot of the Brotherhood that continues to use violence. The Brotherhood itself claims to be a peaceful, democratic organization, and that its leader &quot;condemns violence and violent acts&quot;.

In recent times, the primary state backers of the Muslim Brotherhood have been Qatar and the AKP-ruled Turkey. As of 2015, it is considered a terrorist organization by the governments of Bahrain, Egypt, Russia, Syria, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

==Foundation and history in Egypt==
===Early years===
====Formative period (1928–1936)====
Hassan al-Banna founded the Muslim Brotherhood in the city of Ismailia in March 1928 along with six workers of the Suez Canal Company, as a Pan-Islamic, religious, political, and social movement. They appointed Al-Banna as their leader and vowed to work for Islam through &quot;Jihad&quot; and revive Islamic Brotherhood. Thus, the Muslim Brothers were born; under the pledge that its members would
be soldiers in the call to Islam, and in that is the life for the country and the honour for the &quot;Umma&quot;... We are brothers in the service of Islam.. Hence we are the &quot;Muslim Brothers&quot;.

The Suez Canal Company helped Banna build the mosque in Ismailia that would serve as the Brotherhood&#x27;s headquarters, according to Richard P. Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;The Society of Muslim Brothers&quot;. According to al-Banna, contemporary Islam had lost its social dominance, because most Muslims had been corrupted by Western influences. Sharia law based on the Qur&#x27;an and the Sunnah were seen as laws passed down by God that should be applied to all parts of life, including the organization of the government and the handling of everyday problems.

Al-Banna was populist in his message of protecting workers against the tyranny of foreign and monopolist companies. It founded social institutions such as hospitals, pharmacies, schools, etc. Al-Banna held highly conservative views on issues such as women&#x27;s rights, opposing equal rights for women, but supporting the establishment of justice towards women. The Brotherhood grew rapidly going from 800 members in 1936, to 200,000 by 1938 and over 2 million by 1948.

====Entry into politics (1936–1939)====

As its influence grew, it opposed British rule in Egypt starting in 1936.

al-Banna had been in contact with Amin al-Husseini since 1927.

A central concern for the early Muslim Brotherhood was its pro-Arab activism for the Arab-Zionist conflict in Palestine, which in 1936–1939 culminated in the great Arab revolt. While absent before the outbreak of the revolt, the Brotherhood now began to make use of aggressive anti-Jewish rhetorics which also targeted the Jewish community in Egypt. The official weekly of the Brotherhood, &quot;al-Nadhir&quot;, published a series of articles titled &quot;The Danger of Jews&quot;, warning of alleged Jewish plots against Islam like Freemasonry or Marxism. In 1938 &quot;al-Nadhir&quot; demanded from Egypt&#x27;s Jews to either adopt an openly anti-Zionist stance or to face &quot;hostility&quot;. It also criticized the prominent role of Jews in Egypt&#x27;s society and their prominence in journalism, commercial spheres and the entertainment industry. &quot;al-Nadhir&quot; even called for a boycott and their expulsion, &quot;for they have corrupted Egypt and its population.&quot; In another instance the Jews were referred to as a &quot;societal cancer&quot;. The Brotherhood eventually distributed a list of Jewish business owners and called for their boycott, claiming that they supported the Zionists. Such conflations of Jews and Zionists were common.

In the years preceding World War II the Muslim Brothers grew connections with Nazi Germany, maintained via the Deutsches Nachrichtenbüro in Cairo and Amin al-Husseini, who himself received funds from the Abwehr. Being interested in strengthening a militant anti-British organization, Germany may have funded the Brotherhood as early as 1934. One later British source claimed that in 1936 alone, Germany transferred over £5.000. al-Banna and other members of the Brotherhood voiced admiration for aspects of Nazi ideology, including its militarism and its centralization revolving around a charismatic leader, but opposed others like its racial policies and ethnic nationalism. The outbreak of the war ended the relationship between Germany and the Muslim Brothers. al-Banna denied that he had ever received German funding. Italian funding of the Brotherhood is unlikely, as the latter vehemently opposed the Italian occupation of Libya.

====World War II (1939–1945)====

Over the course of the war, the Brotherhood displayed pro-Axis sympathies. Worried, the British kept the Brotherhood under firm control by temporarily banning its newsletters, surveiling its meetings and arresting various provincial leaders. al-Banna himself was briefly taken into custody and eventually acknowledged his loyalty to the British, although the latter remained suspicious.

Between 1938 and 1940 or 1941 the Brotherhood formed an armed wing called the &quot;Secret Apparatus&quot; (&quot;al-Nizam al-Khas&quot;), also known as &quot;Special Apparatus&quot;. This group was a successor of the &quot;battalions&quot; (&quot;kata&#x27;ib&quot;) established in late 1937. Its goal was to fight the British until their expulsion from Egypt, British collaborators as well as Zionists. It also protected the Brotherhood against the police and infiltrated the Communist movement. The &quot;Secret Apparatus&quot; was led by a committee of five, with each of them commanding one tightly knit cell. Only the most committed members, mostly young students or men with salaried jobs, were invited to join. New members of the &quot;Secret Apparatus&quot; were taught to obey, were given weapons, underwent heavy physical training and were taught the concepts of Jihad and underground operations. The result was a zealous elite force. Its first operation was allegedly towards the end of World War II, when members of the group threw a bomb at a British club. Militarized youth sections were also raised, namely the junior &quot;kashafa&quot; (&quot;scouts&quot;) and the more senior &quot;jawala&quot; (&quot;travellers&quot;).

In 1948, al-Banna denounced fascism and militarism in his book &quot;Peace in Islam&quot;:&quot;Nazism came to power in Germany, Fascism in Italy and both Hitler and Mussolini began to force their people to conform to what they thought; unity, order, development, and power. Certainly, this system led the two countries to stability and a vital international role. This cultivated much hope, reawakened aspiration, and united the whole country under one leader. Then what happened? It became apparent that these seemingly powerful systems were a real disaster. The inspiration and aspirations of the people were shattered and the system of democracy did not lead to the empowerment of the people but to the establishment of chosen tyrants. Eventually after a deadly war in which innumerable men, women, and children died, these regimes collapsed.&quot;

===Post–World War II===
====Conflict in Palestine and Egypt (1945–1952)====

After the war the Brotherhood lobbied for granting Amin al-Husseini, who had served as a German propaganda mouthpiece between 1941 and 1945, asylum in Egypt. In May 1946 al-Husseini managed to escape from French imprisonment and arrived in Cairo. He received a warm welcome, especially by al-Banna, who ennobled him to a &quot;miracle of a man&quot; with &quot;a divine spark in his heart which makes him above human beings&quot;, followed by a martial pledge of loyalty against the Zionists. Soon after his arrival the Arab League established the Arab Higher Executive (rebranded as Arab Higher Committee in January 1947) as supreme Palestinian party with Amin al-Husseini as Cairo-based chairman. al-Banna designated al-Husseini a local Brotherhood leader to spread the influence of the new Palestinian branch established in October 1945. Another small branch was founded in Jordan at the turn of 1946.

The Brotherhood opposed the UN&#x27;s involvement in Palestine from April 1947, with the latter eventually voting for its partition into a Jewish and an Arab state in November 1947. Consequently, the society prepared for war, with volunteers entering Palestine as early as October 1947. By 30th November 1947 Palestine descended into a civil war fought between the Yishuv and al-Husseini&#x27;s Arab Higher Committee, eventually ending in a Palestinian defeat by May 1948. Of the 10,000 fighters al-Banna had promised in October 1947 some 1.500 were present by March 1948. The fighters came from all three branches and were originally engaged in guerrilla activities. The end of Mandatory Palestine and Israel&#x27;s declaration of independence on 14 May resulted in an invasion by five Arab states in 15 May, among them Egypt. Brotherhood fighters assisted the Egyptian army northeast of Gaza, although some were also active in the West Bank. The volunteers suffered a few hundred casualties dead and wounded and had only a limited impact on the course of the war, although they played a decisive role in several engagements. The war was an Arab failure, resulting in a truce fiercely opposed by the Muslim Brothers.

On 2 November 1945 the Brotherhood organized a general strike protesting the Balfour declaration that eventually escalated into deadly riots targeting Jews and foreigners. 
In March 1948 the &quot;Secret Apparatus&quot; assassinated a respected judge for issuing a life sentence against a Muslim Brother for attacking British soldiers. In late 1948 the Brotherhood was estimated to have 2,000 branches and 500,000 members or sympathizers. In November, following several bombings and alleged assassination attempts by the Brotherhood, the Egyptian government arrested 32 leaders of the Brotherhood&#x27;s &quot;Secret Apparatus&quot; and banned the Brotherhood. It was accused of preparing the overthrow of the government, linked to a jeep loaded with weapons. The headquarters were closed and its funds confiscated, while 4,000 Brothers were detained and al-Banna was placed under temporary house arrest. The reaction to the dissolution was the assassination of prime minister Nokrashy Pasha on 28 December by a young &quot;Secret Apparatus&quot; member. al-Banna claimed that the killer acted independently and publicly denounced his faith. After a failed yet lethal bombing in mid-January 1949 which was intended to destroy legal evidence pending against the Brotherhood al-Banna himself was killed in 12 February by vengeful Nokrashy supporters.

In 1952, members of the Muslim Brotherhood were accused of taking part in the Cairo Fire that destroyed some 750 buildings in downtown Cairo – mainly night clubs, theatres, hotels, and restaurants frequented by British and other foreigners.

====Dissolution under the &quot;Free Officers&quot; and Nasser (1952–1970)====

In 1952 Egypt&#x27;s monarchy was overthrown by a group of nationalist military officers (Free Officers Movement) who had formed a cell within the Brotherhood during the first war against Israel in 1948. However, after the revolution Gamal Abdel Nasser, the leader of the &#x27;free officers&#x27; cell, after deposing the first President of Egypt, Muhammad Neguib, in a coup, quickly moved against the Brotherhood, blaming them for an attempt on his life. The Brotherhood was again banned and this time thousands of its members were imprisoned, many being tortured and held for years in prisons and concentration camps. In the 1950s and 1960s many Brotherhood members sought sanctuary in Saudi Arabia. From the 1950s, al-Banna&#x27;s son-in-law Said Ramadan emerged as a major leader of the Brotherhood and the movement&#x27;s unofficial &quot;foreign minister&quot;. Ramadan built a major center for the Brotherhood centered on a mosque in Munich, which became &quot;a refuge for the beleaguered group during its decades in the wilderness&quot;.

In the 1970s after the death of Nasser and under the new President (Anwar Sadat), the Egyptian Brotherhood was invited back to Egypt and began a new phase of participation in Egyptian politics.

===Mubarak era===
During the Mubarak era, observers both defended and criticized the Brotherhood. It was the largest opposition group in Egypt, calling for &quot;Islamic reform&quot;, and a democratic system in Egypt. It had built a vast network of support through Islamic charities working among poor Egyptians. According to ex-Knesset member and author Uri Avnery the Brotherhood was religious but pragmatic, &quot;deeply embedded in Egyptian history, more Arab and more Egyptian than fundamentalist&quot;. It formed &quot;an old established party which has earned much respect with its steadfastness in the face of recurrent persecution, torture, mass arrests and occasional executions. Its leaders are untainted by the prevalent corruption, and admired for their commitment to social work&quot;. It also developed a significant movement online.

In the 2005 parliamentary elections, the Brotherhood became &quot;in effect, the first opposition party of Egypt&#x27;s modern era&quot;. Despite electoral irregularities, including the arrest of hundreds of Brotherhood members, and having to run its candidates as independents (the organization being technically illegal), the Brotherhood won 88 seats (20% of the total) compared to 14 seats for the legal opposition.

During its term in parliament, the Brotherhood &quot;posed a democratic political challenge to the regime, not a theological one&quot;, according to one &quot;The New York Times&quot; journalist, while another report praised it for attempting to transform &quot;the Egyptian parliament into a real legislative body&quot;, that represented citizens and kept the government &quot;accountable&quot;.

But fears remained about its commitment to democracy, equal rights, and freedom of expression and belief—or lack thereof. In December 2006, a campus demonstration by Brotherhood students in uniforms, demonstrating martial arts drills, betrayed to some such as Jameel Theyabi, &quot;the group&#x27;s intent to plan for the creation of militia structures, and a return by the group to the era of &#x27;secret cells&#x27;&quot;. Another report highlighted the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s efforts in Parliament to combat what one member called the &quot;current US-led war against Islamic culture and identity,&quot; forcing the Minister of Culture at the time, Farouk Hosny, to ban the publication of three novels on the ground they promoted blasphemy and unacceptable sexual practices. In October 2007, the Muslim Brotherhood issued a detailed political platform. Among other things, it called for a board of Muslim clerics to oversee the government, and limiting the office of the presidency to Muslim men. In the &quot;Issues and Problems&quot; chapter of the platform, it declared that a woman was not suited to be president because the office&#x27;s religious and military duties &quot;conflict with her nature, social and other humanitarian roles&quot;. While proclaiming &quot;equality between men and women in terms of their human dignity&quot;, the document warned against &quot;burdening women with duties against their nature or role in the family&quot;.

Internally, some leaders in the Brotherhood disagreed on whether to adhere to Egypt&#x27;s 32-year peace treaty with Israel. A deputy leader declared the Brotherhood would seek dissolution of the treaty, while a Brotherhood spokesman stated the Brotherhood would respect the treaty as long as &quot;Israel shows real progress on improving the lot of the Palestinians&quot;.

===2011 revolution and after===

Following the 2011 Egyptian revolution and fall of Hosni Mubarak, the Brotherhood was legalized and was at first very successful, dominating the 2011 parliamentary election and winning the 2012 presidential election, before the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi a year later, leading to a crackdown on the Brotherhood again.

On 30 April 2011, the Brotherhood launched a new party called the Freedom and Justice Party, which won 235 of the 498 seats in the 2011 Egyptian parliamentary elections, far more than any other party. The party rejected the &quot;candidacy of women or Copts for Egypt&#x27;s presidency&quot;, but not for cabinet positions.
The Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s candidate for Egypt&#x27;s 2012 presidential election was Mohamed Morsi, who defeated Ahmed Shafiq—the last prime minister under Mubarak&#x27;s rule—with 51.73% of the vote. Although during his campaign Morsi himself promised to stand for peaceful relations with Israel, some high level supporters and former Brotherhood officials (from the organization&#x27;s 15-member Guidance Council) reiterated hostility towards Zionism. For example, Egyptian cleric Safwat Hegazi spoke at the announcement rally for the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s candidate Morsi and expressed his hope and belief that Morsi would liberate Gaza, restore the Caliphate of the &quot;United States of the Arabs&quot; with Jerusalem as its capital, and that &quot;our cry shall be: &#x27;Millions of martyrs march towards Jerusalem.&#x27;&quot; Within a short period, serious public opposition developed to President Morsi. In late November 2012, he &quot;temporarily&quot; granted himself the power to legislate without judicial oversight or review of his acts, on the grounds that he needed to &quot;protect&quot; the nation from the Mubarak-era power structure. He also put a draft constitution to a referendum that opponents complained was &quot;an Islamist coup&quot;. These issues—and concerns over the prosecutions of journalists, the unleashing of pro-Brotherhood gangs on nonviolent demonstrators, the continuation of military trials, new laws that permitted detention without judicial review for up to 30 days, brought hundreds of thousands of protesters to the streets starting in November 2012.

By April 2013, Egypt had &quot;become increasingly divided&quot; between President Mohamed Morsi and &quot;Islamist allies&quot; and an opposition of &quot;moderate Muslims, Christians and liberals&quot;. Opponents accused &quot;Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood of seeking to monopolize power, while Morsi&#x27;s allies say the opposition is trying to destabilize the country to derail the elected leadership&quot;. Adding to the unrest were severe fuel shortages and electricity outages, which raised suspicions among some Egyptians that the end of gas and electricity shortages since the ouster of President Mohamed Morsi was evidence of a conspiracy to undermine him, although other Egyptians say it was evidence of Morsi&#x27;s mismanagement of the economy.

On 3 July 2013, Mohamed Morsi was removed from office and put into house arrest by the military, that happened shortly after mass protests against him began. demanding the resignation of Morsi. There were also significant counter-protests in support of Morsi; those were originally intended to celebrate the one-year anniversary of Morsi&#x27;s inauguration, and started days before the uprising.
On 14 August, the interim government declared a month-long state of emergency, and riot police cleared the pro-Morsi sit-in during the Rabaa sit-in dispersal of August 2013. Violence escalated rapidly following armed protesters attacking police, according to the National Council for Human Rights&#x27; report; this led to the deaths of over 600 people and injury of some 4,000, with the incident resulting in the most casualties in Egypt&#x27;s modern history. In retaliation, Brotherhood supporters looted and burned police stations and dozens of churches in response to the violence, though a Muslim Brotherhood spokesperson condemned the attacks on Christians and instead blamed military leaders for plotting the attacks. The crackdown that followed has been called the worst for the Brotherhood&#x27;s organization &quot;in eight decades&quot;. By 19 August, Al Jazeera reported that &quot;most&quot; of the Brotherhood&#x27;s leaders were in custody. On that day Supreme Leader Mohammed Badie was arrested, crossing a &quot;red line&quot;, as even Hosni Mubarak had never arrested him. On 23 September, a court ordered the group outlawed and its assets seized. Prime Minister, Hazem Al Beblawi on 21 December 2013, declared the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organisation after a car bomb ripped through a police building and killed at least 14 people in the city of Mansoura, which the government blamed on the Muslim Brotherhood, despite no evidence and an unaffiliated Sinai-based terror group claiming responsibility for the attack.

On 24 March 2014, an Egyptian court sentenced 529 members of the Muslim Brotherhood to death following an attack on a police station, an act described by Amnesty International as &quot;the largest single batch of simultaneous death sentences we&#x27;ve seen in recent years [...] anywhere in the world&quot;. By May 2014, approximately 16,000 people (and as high as more than 40,000 by what &quot;The Economist&quot; calls an &quot;independent count&quot;), mostly Brotherhood members or supporters, have allegedly been arrested by police since the 2013 uprising. On 2 February 2015, an Egyptian court sentenced another 183 members of the Muslim Brotherhood to death.

An editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; claimed that &quot;leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, which became the leading political movement in the wake of Egypt&#x27;s 2011 popular uprising, are languishing in prison, unfairly branded as terrorists. ... Egypt&#x27;s crushing authoritarianism could well persuade a significant number of its citizens that violence is the only tool they have for fighting back&quot;.

Mohamed Morsi was sentenced to death on 16 May 2015, along with 120 others.

The Muslim Brotherhood claimed that Muslims did not carry out the Botroseya Church bombing and claimed it was a false flag conspiracy by the Egyptian government and Copts, in a statement released in Arabic on the FJP&#x27;s website, but its claim was challenged by 100 Women participant Nervana Mahmoud and Hoover Institution and Hudson Institute fellow Samuel Tadros. The Muslim Brotherhood released an English-language commentary on the bombing and said it condemned the terrorist attack.

Qatar-based Muslim Brotherhood members are suspected to have helped a Muslim Brotherhood agent carry out the bombing, according to the Egyptian government. The Qatar-based supporter was named as Mohab Mostafa El-Sayed Qassem. The terrorist was named as Mahmoud Shafiq Mohamed Mostaf.

The Arabic-language website of the Muslim Brotherhood commemorated the anniversary of the death of its leader, Hassan al-Banna, and repeated his words calling for the teachings of Islam to spread all over the world and to raise the &quot;flag of Jihad&quot;, taking their land, &quot;regaining their glory&quot;, &quot;including diaspora Muslims&quot; and demanding an Islamic state and a Muslim government, a Muslim people, a Muslim house, and Muslim individuals.

Mekameleen TV, a Turkey-based free-to-air satellite television channel run by exiled Brotherhood supporters, mourned his death and claimed it was &quot;martyrdom&quot;. Mekameleen supports the Brotherhood. Condolences were sent upon Omar Abdel Rahman&#x27;s death by the website of the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s Freedom and Justice Party in Egypt.

===Controversy===
How much of the blame for the fall from power in Egypt of the Brotherhood and its allied Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) can be placed on the Brotherhood, and how much of it can be placed on its enemies in the Egyptian bureaucracy, media and security establishment is disputed. The Mubarak government&#x27;s state media portrayed the Brotherhood as secretive and illegal, and numerous TV channels such as OnTV spent much of their air time vilifying the organization. But the Brotherhood took a number of controversial steps and also acquiesced to or supported crackdowns by the military during Morsi&#x27;s presidency. Before the revolution, the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s supporters appeared at a protest at Al-Azhar University wearing military-style fatigues, after which the Mubarak government accused the organization of starting an underground militia. When it came to power, the Muslim Brotherhood indeed tried to establish armed groups of supporters and it sought official permission for its members to be armed.

===General leaders===
 Supreme guides or General leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood have been:

* Founder and first General Leader: (1928–1949) Hassan al-Banna 
* 1949–1972 Hassan al-Hudaybi 
* 1972–1986 Umar al-Tilmisani

==Presence outside of Egypt==
===In the Middle East===
====Bahrain====

Following parliamentary elections in 2002, Al Menbar became the largest joint party with eight seats in the forty-seat Chamber of Deputies. Prominent members of Al Menbar include Dr. Salah Abdulrahman, Dr. Salah Al Jowder, and outspoken MP Mohammed Khalid. Additionally, it has strongly opposed the government&#x27;s accession to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

====Iran====

Iranian Call and Reform Organization, a Sunni Islamist group active in Iran, predominantly among Kurds, has been described as an organization &quot;that belongs to the Muslim Brotherhood&quot; or &quot;Iranian Muslim Brotherhood&quot;, while it has officially stated that it is not affiliated with the latter.

====Turkey====

The Turkish AKP, the ruling party of Turkey, publicly supported the Muslim Brotherhood during and a few months after the overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi in July 2013. Then-Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan claimed in an interview that this was because &quot;Turkey would stand by whoever was elected as a result of legitimate elections.&quot; According to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, each year after Morsi&#x27;s overthrow has seen the AKP &quot;significantly detach itself from the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.&quot;

====Iraq====
The Iraqi Islamic Party was formed in 1960 as the Iraqi branch of the Brotherhood, but was banned from 1961 during the nationalist rule of Abd al-Karim Qasim. As government repression hardened under the Baath Party from February 1963, the group was forced to continue underground. After the fall of the Saddam Hussein government in 2003, the Islamic Party has reemerged as one of the main advocates of the country&#x27;s Sunni community. Its leader is Iraqi Vice-president Tariq Al-Hashimi.

The Muslim Brotherhood was an active participation in the &quot;Faith Campaign&quot;. 

Khaled al-Obaidi said that he received a death threat and was declared a non-Muslim by the Muslim Brotherhood.

Also, in the north of Iraq there are several Islamic movements inspired by or part of the Muslim Brotherhood network. The Kurdistan Islamic Union (KIU), a small political party holding 10 seats in the Kurdish parliament, was believed to be supportive of the Muslim Brotherhood in the 90&#x27;s. The group leaders and members have been continuously arrested by Kurdish authorities.

====Israel====

&#x27;Abd al-Rahman al-Banna, the brother of the Muslim Brotherhood founder Hasan al-Banna, went to Mandatory Palestine and established the Muslim Brotherhood there in 1935. Al-Hajj Amin al-Husseini, eventually appointed by the British as Grand Mufti of Jerusalem in hopes of accommodating him, was the leader of the group in Palestine. Another important leader associated with the Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine was &#x27;Izz al-Din al-Qassam, an inspiration to Islamists because he had been the first to lead an armed resistance in the name of Palestine against the British in 1935.

Brotherhood members fought alongside the Arab armies during the 1948 Arab–Israeli war, and, after Israel&#x27;s creation, the ensuing Palestinian refugee crisis encouraged more Palestinian Muslims to join the group. After the war, in the West Bank, the group&#x27;s activity was mainly social and religious, not political, so it had relatively good relations with Jordan during the Jordanian annexation of the West Bank. In contrast, the group frequently clashed with the Egyptian government that controlled the Gaza Strip until 1967.

In the 1950s and 1960s, the Brotherhood&#x27;s goal was &quot;the upbringing of an Islamic generation&quot; through the restructuring of society and religious education, rather than opposition to Israel, and so it lost popularity to insurgent movements and the presence of Hizb ut-Tahrir. Eventually, however, the Brotherhood was strengthened by several factors:
# The creation of al-Mujamma&#x27; al-Islami, the Islamic Center in 1973 by Shaykh Ahmad Yasin had a centralizing effect that encapsulated all religious organizations.
# The Muslim Brotherhood Society in Jordan and Palestine was created from a merger of the branches in the West Bank and Gaza and Jordan.
# Palestinian disillusion with the Palestinian militant groups caused them to become more open to alternatives.
# The Islamic Revolution in Iran offered inspiration to Palestinians. The Brotherhood was able to increase its efforts in Palestine and avoid being dismantled like militant groups because it did not focus on the occupation. While militant groups were being dismantled, the Brotherhood filled the void.

In 2006, the Brotherhood supported Hezbollah&#x27;s military action against Israel. It does not recognize the State of Israel.

====Palestine====

Between 1967 and 1987, the year Hamas was founded, the number of mosques in Gaza tripled from 200 to 600, and the Muslim Brotherhood named the period between 1975 and 1987 a phase of &quot;social institution building.&quot; During that time, the Brotherhood established associations, used zakat (alms giving) for aid to poor Palestinians, promoted schools, provided students with loans, used waqf (religious endowments) to lease property and employ people, and established mosques. Likewise, antagonistic and sometimes violent opposition to Fatah, the Palestine Liberation Organization and other secular nationalist groups increased dramatically in the streets and on university campuses.

In 1987, following the First Intifada, the &quot;Islamic Resistance Movement&quot;, or Hamas was established from Brotherhood-affiliated charities and social institutions that had gained a strong foothold among the local population. During the First Intifada (1987–93), Hamas militarized and transformed into one of the strongest Palestinian militant groups.

The Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip in 2007 was the first time since the Sudanese coup of 1989 that brought Omar al-Bashir to power, that a Muslim Brotherhood group ruled a significant geographic territory. However, the 2013 overthrow of the Mohammad Morsi government in Egypt significantly weakened Hamas&#x27;s position, leading to a blockade of Gaza and economic crisis.

====Jordan====

The Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan originates from the merging of two separate groups which represent the two components of the Jordanian public: the Transjordanian and the West Bank Palestinian.

On 9 November 1945 the Association of the Muslim Brotherhood (Jam&#x27;iyat al-Ikhwan al-Muslimin) was officially registered and Abu Qura became its first General Supervisor. Abu Qura originally brought the Brotherhood to Jordan from Egypt after extensive study and spread of the teachings of Imam Hasan al-Banna. While most political parties and movements were banned for a long time in Jordan such as Hizb ut-Tahrir, the Brotherhood was exempted and allowed to operate by the Jordanian monarchy. In 1948, Egypt, Syria, and Transjordan offered &quot;volunteers&quot; to help Palestine in its war against Israel. Due to the defeat and weakening of Palestine, the Transjordanian and Palestinian Brotherhood merged.

The newly merged Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan was primarily concerned with providing social services and charitable work as well as with politics and its role in the parliament. It was seen as compatible with the political system and supported democracy without the forced implementation of Sharia law which was part of its doctrine. However, internal pressures from younger members of the Brotherhood who called for more militant actions as well as his failing health, Abu Qura resigned as the leader of the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood. On 26 December 1953, Muhammad &#x27;Abd al-Rahman Khalifa, was elected by the movement&#x27;s administrative committee as the new leader of the Transjordanian Brotherhood and he retained this position until 1994. Khalifa was different from his predecessor and older members of the organization because he was not educated in Cairo, he was educated in Syria and Palestine. He established close ties with Palestinian Islamists during his educational life which led him to be jailed for several months in Jordan for criticizing Arab armies in the war.

Khalifa also reorganized the Brotherhood and applied to the government to designate the Brotherhood as &quot;a comprehensive and general Islamic Committee, instead of the previous basis of operation under the &quot;Societies and Clubs Law&quot;. This allowed the Brotherhood to spread throughout the country each with slight socioeconomic and political differences although the majority of the members were of the upper middle class. The radicalization of the Brotherhood began to take place after the peace process between Egypt and Israel, the Islamic Revolution of Iran, as well as their open criticism towards the Jordan-US relationship in the 1970s. Support for the Syrian branch of the Brotherhood also aided the radicalization of the group through open support and training for the rebel forces in Syria. The ideology began to transform into a more militant one which without it would not have the support of the Islamic radicals.

The Jordanian Brotherhood has formed its own political party, the Islamic Action Front. In 1989 they become the largest group in parliament, with 23 out of 80 seats, and 9 other Islamist allies. A Brother was elected president of the National Assembly and the cabinet formed in January 1991 included several MBs.

In 2011, against the backdrop of the Arab Spring, the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood &quot;mobilized popular protests on a larger, more regular, and more oppositional basis than ever before&quot;. and had uniquely positioned themselves as &quot;the only traditional political actor to have remained prominent during [the] new phase of post-Arab Spring activism&quot; which led King Abdullah II and then-Prime Minister Marouf al-Bakhit to invite the Muslim Brotherhood to join Bakhit&#x27;s cabinet, an offer they refused. The Muslim Brotherhood also boycotted the 2011 Jordanian municipal elections and led the 2011–12 Jordanian protests demanding a constitutional monarchy and electoral reforms, which resulted in the firing of Prime Minister Bakhit and the calling of early general elections in 2013.

As of late 2013, the movement in Jordan was described as being in &quot;disarray&quot;. The instability and conflict with the monarchy has led the relationship between the two to crumble. In 2015, some 400 members of the Muslim Brotherhood defected from the original group including top leaders and founding members, to establish another Islamic group, with an allegedly moderate stance. The defectors said that they didn&#x27;t like how things were run in the group and due to the group&#x27;s relations with Hamas, Qatar and Turkey, which put suspicion on the group questioning if they are under the influence and working for the benefit of these states and organizations on the expense of the Jordanian state.

On 13 April 2016, Jordanian police raided and shut the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in Amman. This comes despite the fact that the Jordanian branch cut ties with the mother Egyptian group in January 2016, a designated terrorist organization, a move that is considered to be exclusively cosmetic by experts. Jordanian authorities state that the reason of closure is because that the Brotherhood is unlicensed and is using the name of the defectors&#x27; licensed group. This comes after the Jordanian senate passed a new legislation for the regulation of political parties in 2014, the Muslim Brotherhood did not adhere by the regulations of the new law and so they did not renew their membership.

In 2020, a Jordanian Court of Cassation decided that the local branch of the Muslim Brotherhood will be dissolved after the branch did not renew its license after a new law was issued on organizations.

====Qatar====
In 1999 the Muslim Brotherhood was disbanded in Qatar. The country&#x27;s longstanding support for the group has been often explained as determined by a strategic calculus that limited the role played by religion in Qatar. As the director of the Center for International and Regional Studies at the Doha-based branch of Georgetown University, Mehran Kamrava, posited, Qatar presenting itself as the state patron of the Muslim Brotherhood has caused religion in Qatar to not &quot;play any role in articulating or forming oppositional sentiments.&quot;

Qatar&#x27;s patronage has been primarily expressed through the ruling family&#x27;s endorsement of Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s most representative figures, especially Yusuf al-Qaradawi. Qaradawi is a prominent, yet controversial Sunni preacher and theologian who continues to serve as the spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood. An Egyptian citizen, Qaradawi fled Egypt for Qatar in 1961 after being imprisoned under President Gamal Abdul Nasser. In 1962 he chaired the Qatari Secondary Institute of Religious Studies, and in 1977 he founded and directed the Shariah and Islamic Studies department at the University of Qatar. He left Qatar to return to Egypt shortly before the 2011 Egyptian revolution.

For twenty years, Qaradawi has hosted a popular show titled Shariah and Life on the Qatari-based media channel Al-Jazeera, a government sponsored channel notoriously supportive of the Muslim Brotherhood and Islamism and often designated as a propaganda outlet for the Qatari government. From that platform, he has promoted his Islamist—and often radical views—on life, politics, and culture.

His positions, as well as his controversial ties to extremist and terrorist individuals and organizations, made him persona non grata to the U.S., UK and French governments respectively in 1999, 2008, and 2012.

Before 2013, however, Qatar had made a substantial investment on Morsi&#x27;s leadership and had devolved about $10 million to Egypt since Morsi was elected, allegedly also to &quot;buy political advantage&quot; in the country.

In December 2019, Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told CNN in an interview that Qatar never supported Muslim Brotherhood and does not fund terrorism.

====Kuwait====

Egyptian Brethren came to Kuwait in the 1950s as refugees from Arab nationalism and integrated into the education ministry and other parts of the state. The Brotherhood&#x27;s charity arm in Kuwait is called Al Eslah (Social Reform Society) and its political arm is called the Islamic Constitutional Movement (ICM) or &quot;Hadas&quot;. Members of ICM have been elected to parliament and served in the government and are &quot;widely believed to hold sway with the Ministry of Awqaf&quot; (Islamic endowment) and Islamic Affairs, but have never reached a majority or even a plurality—&quot;a fact that has required them to be pragmatic about working with other political groups&quot;. During the invasion of Kuwait, the Kuwait MB (along with other MB in the Gulf States) supported the American-Saudi coalition forces against Iraq and &quot;quit the brotherhood&#x27;s international agency in protest&quot; over its pro-Saddam stand. However following the Arab Spring and the crackdown on the Egyptian Brotherhood, the Saudi government has put &quot;pressure on other states that have Muslim Brotherhood adherents, asking them to decree that the group is a terrorist organization&quot;, and the local Kuwaiti and other Gulf state Brotherhoods have not been spared pressure from their local governments.

====Saudi Arabia====
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia helped the Brotherhood financially for &quot;over half a century&quot;, but the two became estranged during the Gulf War, and enemies after the election of Mohamed Morsi. Inside the kingdom, before the crushing of the Egyptian MB, the Brotherhood was called a group whose &quot;many quiet supporters&quot; made it &quot;one of the few potential threats&quot; to the royal family&#x27;s control.

The Brotherhood first had an impact inside Saudi Arabia in 1954 when thousands of Egyptian Brethren sought to escape president Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s clampdown, while (the largely illiterate) Saudi Arabia was looking for teachers—who were also conservative pious Arab Muslims—for its newly created public school system. The Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s brand of Islam and Islamic politics differs from the Salafi creed called Wahhabiyya, officially held by the state of Saudi Arabia, and MB members &quot;obeyed orders of the ruling family and &quot;ulama&quot; to not attempt to proselytize or otherwise get involved in religious doctrinal matters within the Kingdom. Nonetheless, the group &quot;methodically ... took control of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s intellectual life&quot; by publishing books and participating in discussion circles and salons held by princes. Although the organization had no &quot;formal organizational presence&quot; in the Kingdom, (no political groups or parties are allowed to operate openly) MB members became &quot;entrenched both in Saudi society and in the Saudi state, taking a leading role in key governmental ministries&quot;. In particular, many established themselves in Saudi educational system. One expert on Saudi affairs (Stephane Lacroix) has stated: &quot;The education system is so controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood, it will take 20 years to change—if at all. Islamists see education as their base&quot; in Saudi Arabia.

Relations between the Saudi ruling family and the Brotherhood became strained with Saudi opposition to Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait and the willingness of Saudi government to allow US troops to be based in the Kingdom to fight Iraq. The Brotherhood supported the &quot;Sahwah&quot; (&quot;Awakening&quot;) movement that pushed for political change in the Kingdom. In 2002, the then Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef denounced the Brotherhood, saying it was guilty of &quot;betrayal of pledges and ingratitude&quot; and was &quot;the source of all problems in the Islamic world&quot;. The ruling family was also alarmed by the Arab Spring and the example set by the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, with president Mohamed Morsi bringing an Islamist government to power by means of popular revolution and elections. Sahwa figures published petitions for reform addressed to the royal government (in violation of Wahhabi quietist doctrine). After the overthrow of the Morsi government in Egypt, all the major Sahwa figures signed petitions and statements denouncing the removal of Morsi and the Saudi government support for it.

In March 2014, in a &quot;significant departure from its past official stance&quot; the Saudi government declared the Brotherhood a &quot;terrorist organization&quot;, followed with a royal decree announced that, from now on,

belonging to intellectual or religious trends or groups that are extremist or categorized as terrorist at the local, regional or international level, as well supporting them, or showing sympathy for their ideas and methods in whichever way, or expressing support for them through whichever means, or offering them financial or moral support, or inciting others to do any of this or promoting any such actions in word or writing

will be punished by a prison sentence &quot;of no less than three years and no more than twenty years&quot;.

====Syria====

The Muslim Brotherhood in Syria was founded in the 1930s (according to lexicorient.com) or in 1945, a year before independence from France, (according to journalist Robin Wright). In the first decade or so of independence it was part of the legal opposition, and in the 1961 parliamentary elections it won ten seats (5.8% of the house). But after the 1963 coup that brought the secular Ba&#x27;ath Party to power it was banned. It played a major role in the mainly Sunni-based movement that opposed the secularist, pan-Arabist Ba&#x27;ath Party. This conflict developed into an armed struggle that continued until culminating in the Hama uprising of 1982, when the rebellion was crushed by the military.

Membership in the Syrian Brotherhood became a capital offense in Syria in 1980 (under Emergency Law 49, which was revoked in 2011), but the headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood-linked Palestinian group, Hamas, was located in the Syria&#x27;s capital Damascus, where it was given Syrian government support. This has been cited as an example of the lack of international centralization or even coordination of the Muslim Brotherhood.

The Brotherhood is said to have &quot;resurrected itself&quot; and become the &quot;dominant group&quot; in the opposition by 2012 during the Syrian Civil War according to the &quot;Washington Post&quot; newspaper. But by 2013 another source described it as having &quot;virtually no influence on the conflict&quot;. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad welcomed the fall of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and remarked that &quot;Arab identity is back on the right track after the fall from power of Egypt&#x27;s Muslim Brotherhood, which had used religion for its own political gain&quot;.

====United Arab Emirates====
Muslim Brotherhood presence in the United Arab Emirates began with the formation of the Al Islah group in the United Arab Emirates in 1974 with the approval of Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum.

Al Islah in the UAE has openly stated that it shares ideology with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Al Islah has criticized the UAE for the country&#x27;s religious tolerance and presence of community Christian churches in the UAE. Since its formation, its members have sought to impose control on state social issues, such as promoting several measures limiting the rights of women. Emirati Al Islah member Tharwat Kherbawi said the Muslim Brotherhood finds the present UAE government to be an &quot;impediment&quot;, and the country itself to be a &quot;treasure and a crucial strategic and economic prize&quot;.

Al Islah was reported to have been secretly forming a military wing that has sought to recruit retired military officers and young Emiratis and is alleged to have plotted the overthrow of the current government and the establishment of an Islamist state in the UAE.

In March 2013, a trial began in Abu Dhabi for 94 individuals linked to Al Islah for an attempted coup on the government. Of the 94, 56 suspects received prison sentences ranging between three and ten years. Eight suspects were sentenced in absentia to 15 years in jail and 26 were acquitted.

On 7 March 2014, the Muslim Brotherhood was designated as a terrorist group by the UAE government.

====Yemen====

The Muslim Brothers fought with North Yemen in the NDF rebellion as Islamic Front.
The Muslim Brotherhood is the political arm of the Yemeni Congregation for Reform, commonly known as Al-Islah. Former President Ali Abdullah Saleh made substantial efforts to entrench the accusations of being in league with Al Qaeda.

The Treasury Department of the US used the label &quot;Bin Laden loyalist&quot; for Abdul Majeed al-Zindani, the Yemeni Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s leader.

===Rest of Africa===
====Algeria====

The Muslim Brotherhood reached Algeria during the later years of the French colonial presence in the country (1830–1962). Sheikh Ahmad Sahnoun led the organization in Algeria between 1953 and 1954 during the French colonialism. Brotherhood members and sympathizers took part in the uprising against France in 1954–1962, but the movement was marginalized during the largely secular FLN one-party rule which was installed at independence in 1962. It remained unofficially active, sometimes protesting the government and calling for increased Islamization and Arabization of the country&#x27;s politics.

When a multi-party system was introduced in Algeria in the early 1990s, the Muslim Brotherhood formed the Movement of Society for Peace (MSP, previously known as Hamas), led by Mahfoud Nahnah until his death in 2003 (he was succeeded by present party leader Boudjerra Soltani). The Muslim Brotherhood in Algeria did not join the Front islamique du salut (FIS), which emerged as the leading Islamist group, winning the 1991 elections and which was banned in 1992 following a military coup d&#x27;état, although some Brotherhood sympathizers did. The Brotherhood subsequently also refused to join the violent post-coup uprising by FIS sympathizers and the Armed Islamic Groups (GIA) against the Algerian state and military which followed, and urged a peaceful resolution to the conflict and a return to democracy. It has thus remained a legal political organization and enjoyed parliamentary and government representation. In 1995, Sheikh Nahnah ran for President of Algeria finishing second with 25.38% of the popular vote. During the 2000s (decade), the party—led by Nahnah&#x27;s successor Boudjerra Soltani—has been a member of a three-party coalition backing President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.

====Libya====

A group of the Muslim Brotherhood came to the Libyan kingdom in the 1950s as refugees escaping crackdown by the Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser, but it was not able to operate openly until after the First Libyan Civil War. They were viewed negatively by King Idris of Libya who had become increasingly wary of their activities. Muammar Gaddafi forbade all forms of Islamism in Libya and was an archenemy to the Muslim Brotherhood for long time. The group held its first public press conference on 17 November 2011, and on 24 December the Brotherhood announced that it would form the Justice and Construction Party (JCP) and contest the General National Congress elections the following year. The Libyan Muslim Brotherhood has &quot;little history of interactions with the masses.&quot;

Despite predictions based on fellow post-Arab Spring nations Tunisia and Egypt that the Brotherhood&#x27;s party would easily win the elections, it instead came a distant second to the National Forces Alliance, receiving just 10% of the vote and 17 out of 80 party-list seats. Their candidate for Prime Minister, Awad al-Baraasi was also defeated in the first round of voting in September, although he was later made a Deputy Prime Minister under Ali Zeidan. A JCP Congressman, Saleh Essaleh is also the vice speaker of the General National Congress.

The Party of Reform and Development is led by Khaled al-Werchefani, a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood.

Sallabi, the Head of Homeland Party, has close ties to Yusuf al-Qaradawi, the spiritual leader of the international Muslim Brotherhood.

The Muslim Brotherhood in Libya has come under widespread criticism, particularly for their alleged ties with extremist organizations operating in Libya. In fact, the text of the U.S. Congress Muslim Brotherhood Terrorist Designation Act of 2015 directly accuses the militias of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood of &quot;joining forces with United States designated terrorist organizations, particularly Ansar al-Sharia&quot; who the United States blames for the attack on its compound in Benghazi. There have been similar reports that those tasked with guarding the Benghazi consulate on the night of the assault were connected to the Muslim Brotherhood.

The Libyan Muslim Brotherhood has lost much of its popular support since 2012 as the group was blamed for divisions in the country. Secular Libyan politicians have continued to voice concerns of the Brotherhood&#x27;s ties to extremist groups. In October 2017, spokesman of the Libyan National Army (LNA) colonel Ahmed Al Masmary claimed that &quot;branches of the Muslim Brotherhood affiliated to al-Qaeda&quot; had joined forces with ISIS in Libya. In the 2014 parliamentary elections, the Muslim Brotherhood won only 25 of the 200 available seats.

====Mauritania====

Changes to the demographic and political makeup of Mauritania in the 1970s heavily contributed to the growth of Islamism within Mauritanian society. Periods of severe drought resulted in urbanization, as large numbers of Mauritanians moved from the countryside to the cities, particularly Nouakchott, to escape the drought. This sharp increase in urbanization resulted in new civil associations being formed, and Mauritania&#x27;s first Islamist organisation, known as Jemaa Islamiyya (Islamic Association) was formed by Mauritanians sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood.

There was increased activism relating to the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1980s, partially driven by members of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood.

In 2007 the National Rally for Reform and Development, better known as Tewassoul, was legalized as a political party. The party is associated with the Mauritanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood.

====Morocco====

The Justice and Development Party was the largest vote-getter in Morocco&#x27;s 2011 election, and as of May 2015, held the office of Prime Minister. It is historically affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, however, despite this, PJD was never an official branch and the party has reportedly &quot;ostentatiously&quot; praised the King of Morocco, while &quot;loudly insisting that it is in no sense whatsoever a Muslim Brotherhood party&quot;.

====Somalia====
Al-Islah has been described as &quot;a generally nonviolent and modernizing Islamic movement that emphasizes the reformation and revival of Islam to meet the challenges of the modern world&quot;, whose &quot;goal is the establishment of an Islamic state&quot; and which &quot;operates primarily in Mogadishu&quot;. 

====Sudan====
An offshoot of the Sudanese branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamic Charter Front grew during the 1960, with Islamic scholar Hasan al-Turabi becoming its Secretary general in 1964. The Islamic Charter Front (ICM) was renamed several times most recently being called the National Islamic Front (NIF). The Muslim Brotherhood/NIF&#x27;s main objective in Sudan was to Islamize the society &quot;from above&quot; and to institutionalize the Islamic law throughout the country where they succeeded. To that end the party infiltrated the top echelons of the government where the education of party cadre, frequently acquired in the West, made them &quot;indispensable&quot;. This approach was described by Turabi himself as the &quot;jurisprudence of necessity&quot;.

Meeting resistance from non-Islamists, from already established Muslim organisations, and from non-Muslims in the south, the Sudanese NIF government under Turabi and the NIF organized a coup to overthrow a democratically elected government in 1989, organized the Popular Defense Force which committed &quot;widespread, deliberate and systematic atrocities against hundreds of thousands of southern civilians&quot; in the 1990s. The NIF government also employed &quot;widespread arbitrary and extrajudicial arrest, torture, and execution of labor union officials, military officers, journalists, political figures and civil society leaders&quot;.

The NCP was dissolved in the aftermath of the military takeover on 11 April 2019.

====Tunisia====

===Europe===
Muslim Brotherhood organisations in Europe find themselves in different circumstances compared to their counterparts in the Muslim World, as they in Europe operate in societies which do not have a Muslim majority. The first Brotherhood members active in Europe migrated from the Middle East during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Some were in the leadership of the Egyptian Brotherhood who fled the dictatorship of Gamal Abdel Nasser. Most were foreign students who already had Brotherhood sympathies while others were experienced militants. Together they continued their Islamic activities in the destination countries, where Europe&#x27;s freedoms allowed them to openly conduct activities which had been banned in the Muslim countries of origin.

Student groups affiliated to the MB grew into organizations and they often structured their mosques as community centres. Following al-Banna&#x27;s organizational model they founded women&#x27;s groups, think tanks and schools. This growth was funded by both public and private donors in the Arab gulf countries.

By establishing a multitude of organizations devoted to anything from education, financial investments, political lobbying and charity they supported the growing Muslim populations of Europe and sought to shape the direction of Islam in Europe. Thereby the brothers created a &quot;de facto&quot; branch of the Muslim Brotherhood in every European country. To increase their potential for gaining influence, the organisations established by the MB are often given names which portray a facade of broad representation (e.g. &quot;Muslim association of European Country&quot;) or religious moderation (e.g. &quot;Islamic Co-Existence Alliance&quot;). This is in contrast to the views propagated by many speakers at MB events where the Western countries are condemned as being corrupt, unjust and immoral along with a narrative where Muslims are portrayed as better, but beleaguered. On certain issues such as religious freedom, women&#x27;s rights and homosexuality Brotherhood spokespersons espouse ideas contrary to mainstream European values and basic human rights.

The pan-European umbrella organization of the Brotherhood in Europe is the Federation of Islamic Organizations in Europe which was founded in 1989 and in 2020 changed its name to Council of European Muslims. It has its headquarters a few blocks away from key European Union institutions in Brussels.

==== France ====
The brotherhood&#x27;s build-up in France started with Union des organisations islamiques en France (UOIF) which later changed its name to Musulmans de France. The organization primarily consisted of foreign students who entered France from Tunisia and Morocco. By 2020, there were 147 mosques and 18 Islamic schools associated with the brotherhood. UOIF has about 50 000 members distributed among 200 member organizations.

The Brotherhood pursues a communitarianist philiosophy and works against Muslims adopting liberal lifestyles and becoming assimilated into French society. In the long term, they aim towards entering politics by increasing the number of Muslims until they can form a political party of their own.

====Germany====
The Islamic Community of Germany &quot;(de: Islamische Gemeinschaft in Deutschland e.V, IGD)&quot; being constituent and founding organisation of the MB umbrella organisation FIOE, the MB is active in Germany with the IGD as a proxy. IGD members take care to not publicly declare their affiliation to the MB.

====Russia====
The Muslim Brotherhood is banned in Russia as a terrorist organisation.

As affirmed on 14 February 2003 by the decision of the Supreme Court of Russia, the Muslim Brotherhood coordinated the creation of an Islamic organisation called &quot;&quot; (, led by Ibn Al-Khattab and Basaev; an organisation that committed multiple terror-attack acts in Russia and was allegedly financed by drug trafficking, counterfeiting of coins and racketeering.

====United Kingdom====
The Muslim Brotherhood uses London as an administration base.

The first Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated organisations in the UK were founded in the 1960s, which comprised exiles and overseas students. They promoted the works of Indian theologician Abu A&#x27;la Mawdudi and represented the Jama&#x27;at-e-Islami. In their initial phase they were politically inactive in the UK as they assumed they would return to their home countries and instead focused on recruiting new members and to support the MB in the Arab world.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the MB and its associated organisations changed to a new strategy of political activity in western countries with the purpose to promote the MB overseas but also preserve the autonomy of Muslim communities in the UK.

In the 1990s, the MB established publicly visible organisations and ostensibly &quot;national&quot; organisations to further its agenda, but membership in the MB was and remains a secret. The MB dominated the Islamic Society of Britain (ISB), the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB) and founded the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB). MAB became politically active in foreign policy issues such as Palestine and Iraq, while MCB established a dialogue with the then governments.

Since 2001, the ISB has distanced itself from Muslim Brotherhood ideology along with the MCB.

In April 2014, David Cameron, who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the time, launched an investigation into the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s activities in the UK and its alleged extremist activities.

In a 2015 government report, the MB was found to not have been linked to terrorist related activity against in the UK and MAB has condemned Al-Qaeda terrorist activity in the UK.

===Other states===
====Australia====
The Muslim Brotherhood Movement is an Arab street gang in Sydney that uses the same name as the Muslim Brotherhood.

In 2013, members of Sydney&#x27;s Egyptian community reported that the Muslim Brotherhood had opened an office in Western Sydney, following the election and later overthrowing of Egyptian President Mursi, both of which caused protests in Sydney.

====Indonesia====

Several parties and organizations in Indonesia are linked or at least inspired by the Muslim Brotherhood, although none have a formal relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood. One of the Muslim Brotherhood-linked parties is the PKS (Prosperous Justice Party), which gained 6.79% of votes in the 2014 legislative election, down from 7.88% in the 2009 election. The PKS&#x27;s relationship with the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood was confirmed by Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a prominent Muslim Brotherhood leader.

====Malaysia====
The Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), the oldest and largest mainstream Islamist party in Malaysia, has close personal and ideological ties with the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. Founded in 1951, PAS&#x27;s founders were exposed to the ideas and teachings while they were studying in Cairo during the 1940s. PAS was the main rival to the Malay nationalist United Malays National Organisation, which dominated Malaysian politics until 2018. Due to changes in political situation created by Pakatan Harapan (PH)&#x27;s win in 2018 election, PAS has made a cooperation pact with UMNO in 2019. Together with a former PH component party (BERSATU) both parties ultimately took over the government during 2020-21 Malaysian political crisis. According to the think tank Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs&#x27; CEO Wan Saiful Wan Jan, PAS is regarded by the Muslim Brotherhood as an electorally successful Islamic political party; PAS has governed the state of Kelantan since 2002. PAS representatives are often invited to Muslim Brotherhood speaking engagements overseas. In 2012, PAS President Abdul Hadi Awang spoke alongside Muslim Brotherhood scholar Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi at a speaking event in London. In April 2014, PAS leader Abdul Awang spoke out against Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates&#x27; decision to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization.

According to Bubalo and Fealy, &quot;Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia&quot; (or the Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia) was inspired or influenced by the Muslim Brotherhood.

====New Zealand====
In 2016, Papanui ward candidate John Stringer alleged that a Muslim Brotherhood cell was active in northwestern Christchurch.

====United States====
According to a 2004 article by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, U.S. Muslim Brotherhood supporters &quot;make up the U.S. Islamic community&#x27;s most organized force&quot; by running hundreds of mosques and business ventures, promoting civic activities, and setting up American Islamic organizations to defend and promote Islam. In 1963, the U.S. chapter of Muslim Brotherhood was started by activists involved with the Muslim Students Association (MSA). U.S. supporters of the Brotherhood also started other organizations including: North American Islamic Trust in 1971, the Islamic Society of North America in 1981, the American Muslim Council in 1990, the Muslim American Society in 1992 and the International Institute of Islamic Thought in the 1980s. In addition, according to &quot;An Explanatory Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal for the Group in North America&quot;, the &quot;Understanding of the Role of the Muslim Brotherhood in North America&quot;, and a relatively benign goal of the Muslim Brotherhood in North America is identified as the following:

Establishing an effective and a stable Islamic movement led by the Muslim Brotherhood which adopts Muslims&#x27; causes domestically and globally, and which works to expand the observant Muslim base, aims at unifying and directing Muslims&#x27; efforts, presents Islam as a civilization alternative, and supports the global Islamic state wherever it is.

The process of settlement is a &#x27;Civilization-Jihadist Process&#x27; with all the word means. The Ikhwan [Muslim Brotherhood] must understand that their work in America is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and &#x27;sabotaging&#x27; its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God&#x27;s religion [Islam] is made victorious over all other religions.

During the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2007, several documents pertaining to the Brotherhood were unsuccessful in convincing the courts that the Brotherhood was involved in subversive activities. In one, dated 1984 called &quot;Ikhwan in America&quot; (Brotherhood in America), the author alleges that the activities of the Muslim Brotherhood in the US include going to camps to do weapons training (referred to as &quot;special work&quot; by the Muslim Brotherhood), as well as engaging in counter-espionage against U.S. government agencies such as the FBI and CIA (referred to as &quot;Securing the Group&quot;). Another (dated 1991) outlined a strategy for the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States that involved &quot;eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within&quot;.

Penned in May 1991 by a man named Mohamed Akram Adlouni, the &#x27;Explanatory Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal for the Group in North America&#x27; was discovered during an FBI raid of a Virginia home in 2004. The document was admitted as an exhibit to the court during the 2007 Holy Land Foundation trial, in which that group was charged with laundering money. After the trial, the document became public. But, according to a 2009 opinion by the presiding judge, the memo was not considered &#x27;supporting evidence&#x27; for that alleged money laundering scheme, nor any other conspiracy.

The documents continue to be widely publicized in American conservative circles.

U.S. Congress attempts to pass legislation criminalizing the group, put forward by the 114th Congress, were defeated. The Bill, called the Muslim Brotherhood Terrorist Designation Act of 2015, was introduced to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations by Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX). In it the bill states that the Department of State should designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. If passed, the bill would have required the State Department to report to Congress within 60 days whether or not the group fits the criteria, and if it did not, to state which specific criteria it had not met.

This bill came after a handful of foreign countries made similar moves in recent years including Egypt, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and others, and after, according to Cruz, recent evidence emerged suggesting that the group supports terrorism. The senator further alleged that the group&#x27;s stated goal is to wage violent jihad against its enemies, which includes the United States, and the fact that the Obama administration has listed numerous group members on its terror list. Cruz further stated that the bill would &quot;reject the fantasy that [the] parent institution [of the Muslim Brotherhood] is a political entity that is somehow separate from these violent activities&quot;.

The bill identifies three Muslim Brotherhood entities in the U.S. including the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), a non-profit group denounced by the UAE for its MB ties. The other two entities are the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) and the North American Islamic Trust (NAIT).

Conservatives in the Congress believe that the group is a breeding ground for radical Islam. Previous attempts were made in the previous year by Representative Michele Bachmann (R-MN), but it failed largely due to her allegation that Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton&#x27;s aide, had links to the organization, a statement which was dismissed by establishment Democrats and Republicans.

In February 2016, the House Judiciary Committee approved the legislation in a 17 to 10 vote, which if enacted could increase grounds for enforcing criminal penalties and give permission to the Secretary of Treasury to block financial transactions and freeze assets of anyone who has showed material support for the group. Scholars against this classification claim that the group simply promotes Islamism, or the belief that society should be governed according to Islamic values and Sharia law.

Past U.S. presidential administrations have examined whether to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and have decided not to do so. During the George W. Bush administration, the U.S. government investigated the Brotherhood and associated Islamist groups, but &quot;after years of investigations, ... the U.S. and other governments, including Switzerland&#x27;s, closed investigations of the Brotherhood leaders and financial group for lack of evidence, and removed most of the leaders from sanctions lists.&quot; The Obama administration was also pressured to designate the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization, but did not do so. During the Donald Trump administration, there were serious steps towards designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization.

==Beliefs==

The Brotherhood&#x27;s English-language website describes its principles as including firstly the introduction of the Islamic Sharia as &quot;the basis for controlling the affairs of state and society&quot; and secondly, working to unify &quot;Islamic countries and states, mainly among the Arab states, and liberate them from foreign imperialism&quot;. The Brotherhood is heavily influenced by the early &quot;Salafiyya&quot; movement and regularly advocates Salafi revivalist themes that address the contemporary challenges faced by Muslims, calling for the establishment of an Islamic state through implementation of the &quot;Shari&#x27;ah&quot; and Jihad against disbelievers. Science and technology should be harnessed through Islamic means to revive the Islamic prowess and Jihad should be waged personally as well as communally to bring forth effective political transformations. The Brotherhood share common creedal beliefs with other &quot;Salafiyya&quot; movements, such as i) strict monotheism with regard to Divine attributes, ii) purifying Islam from accretions and folk practices associated with Sufism, and iii) focusing on the moral integrity of individuals through &quot;Tazkiyya.&quot; Activist Salafis have a historical tradition of influential political activism across the various branches and affiliates of the Muslim Brotherhood movement.

Its founder, Hassan Al-Banna, was influenced by pan-Islamic scholars Muhammad Abduh and Rashid Rida (who attacked the &quot;taqlid&quot; of the official &quot;`ulama&quot;, and he insisted that only the Quran and the best-attested hadiths should be sources of the &quot;Sharia&quot;), with the group structure and approach being influenced by Sufism. However, Al-Banna avoided controversies over doctrine and would distance himself from the anti-Sufi dogmas of Rashid Rida. As a teen, Al-Banna had been initiated into the Hasafi branch of &quot;Shadhiliyya&quot; order and was not hostile to various Sufi practices condemned as aspects of polytheism by Rida. While Al-Banna agreed with Rida on the need to purify religious practices of illegitimate innovations, he saw nothing wrong with visits to the graves of &quot;Awliyaa&quot; (saints) so long as one did not seek their intercession. He would later declare the Hasafiyya society as a precursor to the Muslim Brotherhood; while also acknowledging his debt to the &quot;Salafiyya&quot; tradition.

Al-Banna downplayed doctrinal differences between schools (acknowledging Shi&#x27;ism as a valid &quot;fifth school&quot;, while declaring Ahmadiyya and the Islam-related Baháʼí and Druze religions to be &quot;takfir&quot;) emphasizing the political importance of worldwide unity of the &quot;ummah&quot;. In the few occasions a mature Al-Banna did address theology, he espoused Salafi views by expressing his dislike of &quot;Ilm al-Kalam&quot;, philosophy, etc. and seeking his preference to draw directly from &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot;, &quot;Sunnah&quot; and &quot;Salaf&quot;. However he would not openly side with Atharis against the Ash&#x27;aris, instead lumping all the medieval theological debates as irrelevant. While his religious activism resembled Ibn Taymiyya, Banna&#x27;s approach to theological prioritisation was imparted through Sufi-inspired Ghazalian expressions. After the creation of Muslim Brotherhood organisation, Al-Banna would not maintain formal affiliations with Sufi orders. While the Brothers acknowledged the validity of the true spiritual &quot;Tasawwuf&quot;, they would be critical of institutionalised Sufi orders; which in their view led to divisions amongst the Muslims.

As Islamic Modernist beliefs were co-opted by secularist rulers and official &quot;ulama&quot;, the Brotherhood has become traditionalist and conservative, &quot;being the only available outlet for those whose religious and cultural sensibilities had been outraged by the impact of Westernization&quot;. Al-Banna believed the Quran and Sunnah constitute a perfect way of life and social and political organization that God has set out for man. Islamic governments must be based on this system and eventually unified in a Caliphate. The Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s goal, as stated by its founder al-Banna was to drive out British colonial and other Western influences, reclaim Islam&#x27;s manifest destiny—an empire, stretching from Spain to Indonesia. The Brotherhood preaches that Islam will bring social justice, the eradication of poverty, corruption and sinful behavior, and political freedom (to the extent allowed by the laws of Islam). Blended with methods of modern social sciences, some key thinkers of Brotherhood have also contemplated the Islamic perspective on bureaucratic effectiveness, mapping out solutions to problems of formalism and irresponsiveness to public concerns in public administration, which pertains to the pro-democratic tenets of Muslim Brotherhood. Such variations of thoughts have also purportedly negated the realities of contemporary Muslim countries as their authors have proclaimed.

On the issue of women and gender the Muslim Brotherhood interprets Islam conservatively. Its founder called for &quot;a campaign against ostentation in dress and loose behavior&quot;, &quot;segregation of male and female students&quot;, a separate curriculum for girls, and &quot;the prohibition of dancing and other such pastimes ... &quot;

There have been breakaway groups from the movement, including the al-Jama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya and Takfir wal-Hijra. Prominent figures of the Brotherhood include Sayyid Qutb, a highly influential thinker of Islamism, and the author of &quot;Milestones&quot;. Osama bin Laden criticized the Brotherhood, and accused it of betraying &quot;jihad&quot; and the ideals of Qutb.

=== Stance on democracy, civil rights and secularism ===
According to Deputy of the Chairman of the Muslim Brotherhood, Dr. Mohamed El-Sayed Habib, the Muslim Brotherhood believes in implementing various political reforms for enabling freedom of assembly, press freedoms, democracy, political pluralism, peaceful transition of power, etc.

We believe that the political reform is the true and natural gateway for all other kinds of reform. We have announced our acceptance of democracy that acknowledges political pluralism, the peaceful rotation of power and the fact that the nation is the source of all powers. As we see it, political reform includes the termination of the state of emergency, restoring public freedoms, including the right to establish political parties, whatever their tendencies may be, and the freedom of the press, freedom of criticism and thought, freedom of peaceful demonstrations, freedom of assembly, etc. It also includes the dismantling of all exceptional courts and the annulment of all exceptional laws, establishing the independence of the judiciary, enabling the judiciary to fully and truly supervise general elections so as to ensure that they authentically express people&#x27;s will, removing all obstacles that restrict the functioning of civil society organizations, etc.

However, the Brotherhood is opposed to secularism and seeks the implementation of Shari&#x27;a (Islamic law) as the basis of Egyptian legal system and insists on complying the political system with Islamic legal precepts. When asked whether the Muslim Brotherhood seeks to establish a religious theocracy; the same spokesperson replied:
This concern stems from a wrong understanding of the nature of Islam. To those who speak about a religious state, in the same ecclesiastical meaning given to it in Europe in the Middle Ages, when the church had hegemony over a State&#x27;s authorities, we wish to say that the issue here is completely different. The Muslim Brotherhood has gone through the latest legislative elections on the basis of a clear-cut program under the slogan &quot;Islam is the Solution&quot;, given the fact that Islam, as Imam el-Banna said, is a comprehensive program that encompasses all aspects of life: it is a state and a country, a government and people, ethics and power, mercy and justice, culture and law, science and justice, resources and wealth, defense and advocacy, an army and an idea, a true belief and correct acts of worship.

===Mottos===
The Brotherhood&#x27;s &quot;most frequently used slogan&quot; (according to the BBC) is &quot;Islam is the Solution&quot; (الإسلام هو الحل). According to academic Khalil Yusuf, its motto &quot;was traditionally&quot; &quot;Believers are but Brothers.&quot;

Hasan Al-Banna presented the reform programme of the Muslim Brothers as one that sought to encompass every sphere of life; defining the movement as:
a &quot;Salafiyya&quot; message, a Sunni way, a Sufi truth, a political organization, an athletic group, a cultural-educational union, an economic company, and a social idea

==Strategy and organization==
The Muslim Brothers consider their movement to be the practical extension of the pan-Islamist movement championed by Sayyid Jamal al-Din Afghani, Muhammad &#x27;Abduh, and Rashid Rida. Afghani is regarded as the ‘caller’ or ‘announcer’ (&quot;mu&#x27;adhdhin&quot;, &quot;sarkha&quot;); Rida as the ‘archivist’ or ‘historian’ (&quot;sijal&quot;, &quot;mu&#x27;arrikh&quot;) and Banna was seen as the ‘builder&#x27; (&quot;bani&quot;) of the Islamic renaissance movement. Afghani was considered as the spiritual father of the movement and as a fiery defender of the faith against both internal corruption and external encroachment. ‘Abduh was viewed as &quot;a well-meaning shaykh who inspired reforms in the Azhar&quot;. The methodology of the Brotherhood was characterised by the scholarly orthodoxy and conservatism of Muhammad Rashid Rida. Like Rida, Banna too advocated a conservative revival to values of early Muslim generations and viewed Islam to be a comprehensive faith, outlining it as: &quot;a faith and a ritual, a nation (watan) and a nationality, a religion and a state, spirit and deed, holy text and sword&quot;. 
The Muslim Brotherhood movement sought the re-establishment of a World Islamic Caliphate which was envisaged to come through several Islamic national states, united in a league, and appointing a single leader to rule over them after &quot;Shura&quot; (consultation). This vision was based upon the Islamic state doctrines of Muhammad Rashid Rida. However, Al-Banna prioritised the immediate form of governance that the Brotherhood had to establish and did not advocate the radical overthrow of these structures, instead preferring gradualism. He favored a constitutional government with a representative parliamentary system that implemented Islamic law (&quot;Sharia&quot;). The aim for Caliphate was more of an utopian ideal than an explicit and practical political goal which was the construction of Islamic national units which would then bond together towards a global Islamic polity.

The Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s position on political participation varied according to the &quot;domestic situation&quot; of each branch, rather than ideology. For many years its stance was &quot;collaborationist&quot; in Kuwait and Jordan; for &quot;pacific opposition&quot; in Egypt; &quot;armed opposition&quot; in Libya and Syria. It was written on 1 December 1982, by Yusuf al-Qaradawi at the culmination of a series of two meetings held in 1977 and 1982 in Lugano, Switzerland. The treaty instructs Brotherhood members to show &quot;flexibility&quot; when it comes to their activity outside the Islamic world, encouraging them to temporarily adopt Western values without deviating from their &quot;basic [Islamic] principles.&quot;

The Muslim Brotherhood is a transnational organization as opposed to a political party, but its members have created political parties in several countries, such as the Islamic Action Front in Jordan, Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank, and the former Freedom and Justice Party in Egypt. These parties are staffed by Brotherhood members, but are otherwise kept independent from the Muslim Brotherhood to some degree, unlike Hizb ut-Tahrir, which is highly centralized. The Brotherhood has been described as a &quot;combination of neo-Sufic &quot;tariqa&quot;&quot; (with al-Banna as the original &quot;murshid&quot; i.e., guide of the tariqa) &quot;and a political party&quot;. The Egyptian Brotherhood has a pyramidal structure with &quot;families&quot; (or &quot;usra&quot;, which consists of four to five people and is headed by a &quot;naqib&quot;, or &quot;captain&quot;) at the bottom, &quot;clans&quot; above them, &quot;groups&quot; above clans and &quot;battalions&quot; or &quot;phalanxes&quot; above groups. Potential Brethren start out as &quot;Muhib&quot; or &quot;lovers&quot;, and if approved move up to become a &quot;muayyad&quot;, or &quot;supporter&quot;, then to &quot;muntasib&quot; or &quot;affiliated&quot;, (who are nonvoting members). If a muntasib &quot;satisfies his monitors&quot;, he is promoted to &quot;muntazim&quot;, or &quot;organizer&quot;, before advancing to the final level—&quot;ach &#x27;amal&quot;, or &quot;working brother&quot;. With this slow careful advancement, the loyalty of potential members can be &quot;closely probed&quot; and obedience to orders assured.

At the top of the hierarchy is the Guidance Office (&quot;Maktab al-Irshad&quot;), and immediately below it is the Shura Council. Orders are passed down through a chain of command:
* The Shura Council has the duties of planning, charting general policies and programs that achieve the goal of the Group. It is composed of roughly 100 Muslim Brothers. Important decisions, such as whether to participate in elections, are debated and voted on within the Shura Council and then executed by the Guidance Office. Its resolutions are binding to the Group and only the General Organizational Conference can modify or annul them and the Shura Office has also the right to modify or annul resolutions of the Executive Office. It follows the implementation of the Group&#x27;s policies and programs. It directs the Executive Office and it forms dedicated branch committees to assist in that.
* Executive Office or Guidance Office (&quot;Maktab al-Irshad&quot;), which is composed of approximately 15 longtime Muslim Brothers and headed by the supreme guide or General Masul (&quot;murshid&quot;) Each member of the Guidance Office oversees a different portfolio, such as university recruitment, education, or politics. Guidance Office members are elected by the Shura Council. Divisions of the Guidance/Executive Office include:
** Executive leadership
** Organizational office
** Secretariat general
** Educational office
** Political office
** Sisters office

The Muslim Brotherhood aimed to build a transnational organization. In the 1940s, the Egyptian Brotherhood organized a &quot;section for Liaison with the Islamic World&quot; endowed with nine committees. Groups were founded in Lebanon (1936), in Syria (1937), and Transjordan (1946). It also recruited members among the foreign students who lived in Cairo where its headquarters became a center and a meeting place for representatives from the whole Muslim world.

In each country with an MB there is a Branch committee with a Masul (leader) appointed by the General Executive leadership with essentially the same Branch-divisions as the Executive office. &quot;Properly speaking&quot; Brotherhood branches exist only in Arab countries of the Middle East where they are &quot;in theory&quot; subordinate to the Egyptian General Guide. Beyond that the Brotherhood sponsors national organizations in countries like Tunisia (&quot;Ennahda Movement&quot;), Morocco (Justice and Charity party), Algeria (Movement of Society for Peace). Outside the Arab world it also has influence, with former President of Afghanistan, Burhanuddin Rabbani, having adopted MB ideas during his studies at Al-Azhar University, and many similarities between mujahideen groups in Afghanistan and Arab MBs. Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia in Malaysia is close to the Brotherhood. According to scholar Olivier Roy, as of 1994 &quot;an international agency&quot; of the Brotherhood &quot;assures the cooperation of the ensemble&quot; of its national organizations. The agency&#x27;s &quot;composition is not well known, but the Egyptians maintain a dominant position&quot;.

==Criticism==
The Brotherhood was criticised by Ayman al-Zawahiri, then the Deputy Emir of al-Qaeda, in 2007 for its refusal to advocate the violent overthrow of the Mubarak government. Essam el-Erian, a top Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood figure, denounced the al-Qaeda leader: &quot;Zawahiri&#x27;s policy and preaching bore dangerous fruit and had a negative impact on Islam and Islamic movements across the world&quot;.

Dubai police chief, Dhahi Khalfan accused Egypt&#x27;s Muslim Brotherhood of an alleged plot to overthrow the UAE government. He referred to the Muslim Brotherhood as &quot;dictators&quot; who want &quot;Islamist rule in all the Gulf States&quot;.

===Motives===

Numerous officials and reporters question the sincerity of the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s pronouncements. These critics include, but are not limited to:
*Juan Zarate, former U.S. White House counterterrorism chief (quoted in the conservative publication, &quot;FrontPage Magazine&quot;): &quot;The Muslim Brotherhood is a group that worries us not because it deals with philosophical or ideological ideas but because it defends the use of violence against civilians&quot;.
*Former U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross, who told &quot;Asharq Alawsat&quot; newspaper that the Muslim Brotherhood is a global, not a local organization, governed by a Shura (Consultative) Council, which rejects cessation of violence in Israel, and supports violence to achieve its political objectives elsewhere too.
*Sarah Mousa of Al Jazeera reported on the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s highly improbable claim that opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mohammad ElBaradei (who has had a &quot;rocky&quot; relationship with the US) was &quot;an American agent&quot;, and observed that the since-defunct Muslim Brotherhood-controlled Shura Council&#x27;s support of the slander demonstrated a lack of commitment to democracy.
*Scholar Carrie Rosefsky Wickham finds official Brotherhood documents ambiguous on the issue of democracy: &quot;This raises the question of whether the Brotherhood is supporting a transition to democracy as an end in itself or as a first step toward the ultimate establishment of a political system based not on the preferences of the Egyptian people but the will of God as they understand it&quot;.

===Status of non-Muslims===
*In 1997, Muslim Brotherhood Supreme Guide Mustafa Mashhur told journalist Khalid Daoud that he thought Egypt&#x27;s Coptic Christians and Orthodox Jews should pay the long-abandoned &quot;jizya&quot; poll tax, levied on non-Muslims in exchange for protection from the state, rationalized by the fact that non-Muslims are exempt from military service while it is compulsory for Muslims. He went on to say, &quot;we do not mind having Christian members in the People&#x27;s Assembly. ... [T]he top officials, especially in the army, should be Muslims since we are a Muslim country. ... This is necessary because when a Christian country attacks the Muslim country and the army has Christian elements, they can facilitate our defeat by the enemy&quot;. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, the proposal caused an &quot;uproar&quot; among Egypt&#x27;s 16 million Coptic Christians and &quot;the movement later backtracked&quot;.

===Response to criticisms===
According to authors writing in the Council on Foreign Relations magazine &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;: &quot;At various times in its history, the group has used or supported violence and has been repeatedly banned in Egypt for attempting to overthrow Cairo&#x27;s secular government. Since the 1970s, however, the Egyptian Brotherhood has disavowed violence and sought to participate in Egyptian politics&quot;. Jeremy Bowen, the Middle East editor for the BBC, called it &quot;conservative and non-violent&quot;. The Brotherhood &quot;has condemned&quot; terrorism and the 9/11 attacks.

The Brotherhood itself denounces the &quot;catchy and effective terms and phrases&quot; like &quot;fundamentalist&quot; and &quot;political Islam&quot; which it claims are used by &quot;Western media&quot; to pigeonhole the group, and points to its &quot;15 Principles&quot; for an Egyptian National Charter, including &quot;freedom of personal conviction ... opinion ... forming political parties ... public gatherings ... free and fair elections ...&quot;

Similarly, some analysts maintain that whatever the source of modern Jihadi terrorism and the actions and words of some rogue members, the Brotherhood now has little in common with radical Islamists and modern jihadists who often condemn the Brotherhood as too moderate. They also deny the existence of any centralized and secretive global Muslim Brotherhood leadership. Some claim that the origins of modern Muslim terrorism are found in Wahhabi ideology, not that of the Muslim Brotherhood.

According to anthropologist Scott Atran, the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood even in Egypt has been overstated by Western commentators. He estimates that it can count on only 100,000 militants (out of some 600,000 dues paying members) in a population of more than 80 million, and that such support as it does have among Egyptians—an often cited figure is 20 percent to 30 percent—is less a matter of true attachment than an accident of circumstance: secular opposition groups that might have countered it were suppressed for many decades, but in driving the Egyptian revolution of 2011, a more youthful constellation of secular movements has emerged to threaten the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s dominance of the political opposition. This has not yet been the case, however, as evidenced by the Brotherhood&#x27;s strong showing in national elections. Polls also indicate that a majority of Egyptians and other Arab nations endorse laws based on &quot;Sharia&quot;.

==Foreign relations==

On 29 June 2011, as the Brotherhood&#x27;s political power became more apparent and solidified following the Egyptian revolution of 2011, the United States announced that it would reopen formal diplomatic channels with the group, with whom it had suspended communication as a result of suspected terrorist activity. The next day, the Brotherhood&#x27;s leadership announced that they welcomed the diplomatic overture.

In September 2014, Brotherhood leaders were expelled from Qatar. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported: &quot;Although the Brotherhood&#x27;s views are not nearly as conservative as the puritanical, authoritarian version of Islamic law enforced in Saudi Arabia, the Saudis and other gulf monarchies fear the group because of its broad organization, its mainstream appeal and its calls for elections&quot;.

===Designation as a terrorist organization===
Countries and organizations below have officially listed the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization.
* Russia – 12 February 2003
* Kazakhstan – 15 March 2005
* Tajikistan – 30 March 2006
* Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) – 7 May 2009
* Syria – 21 October 2013
* Egypt – 25 December 2013
* Saudi Arabia – 7 March 2014
* Bahrain – 21 March 2014
* United Arab Emirates – 15 November 2014

Libya&#x27;s Tobruk-based House of Representatives also designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist group on May 14, 2019.

====Outside the Middle East====
In February 2003, the Supreme Court of Russia banned the Muslim Brotherhood, labelling it as a terrorist organization, and accusing the group of supporting Islamist rebels who want to create an Islamic state in the North Caucasus.

In an interview published on March 1, 2014, the Aga Khan IV spoke well of the Muslim Brotherhood - praising the way they &quot;act in civil society&quot;.

In January 2017, during his confirmation hearing, the former U.S. Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, referred to the Muslim Brotherhood, along with Al-Qaeda, as an agent of radical Islam—a characterization that Human Rights Watch member Sarah Leah Whitson criticized on social media, disseminating a statement from the HRW Washington director saying that the conflation of the group with violent extremists was inaccurate. The following month, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump was considering an order designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a foreign terrorist organization.

The Muslim Brotherhood was criticized by Secretary Tillerson. The terrorist designation for the Muslim Brotherhood is opposed by Human Rights Watch and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, both liberal-leaning institutions. The potential terrorist designation was criticized, in particular, by Human Rights Watch member Laura Pitter. &quot;The New York Times&quot; set forth its opposition in an editorial that claimed that the Muslim Brotherhood is a collection of movements, and argued that the organization as a whole does not merit the terrorist designation: &quot;While the Brotherhood calls for a society governed by Islamic law, it renounced violence decades ago, has supported elections and has become a political and social organization&quot;. The designation of the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization is opposed by the Brennan Center for Justice, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Council on American-Islamic Relations and American Civil Liberties Union.

Human Rights Watch and its director Kenneth Roth oppose proposals to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization.

Gehad El-Haddad, a Muslim Brotherhood member, denied that terrorism was practiced by the Muslim Brotherhood in an editorial published by &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In a report by the Carnegie Middle East Center, Nathan Brown and Michele Dunne argued that &quot;designating the Muslim Brotherhood a foreign terrorist organization may actually backfire,&quot; writing: &quot;The sweeping measure to declare the Brotherhood a foreign terrorist organization now being contemplated not only does not accord with the facts, but is also more likely to undermine than achieve its ostensible purpose and could result in collateral damage affecting other U.S. policy goals. The greatest damage might be in the realm of public diplomacy, as using a broad brush to paint all Muslim Brotherhood organizations as terrorists would be understood by many Muslims around the world as a declaration of war against non-violent political Islamists—and indeed against Islam itself.&quot;

The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt avoids directly implicating itself materially in terrorism while it supports terrorism with words and encourages it, according to WINEP fellow Eric Trager, who advocated pushing them into a corner instead of designating them due to issues with materially connecting them to terrorism other than with their words.

The editorial boards of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; oppose designation of the group as a terrorist organization.

Civil rights lawyer and adjunct professor of law Arjun Singh Sethi wrote that the push to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization was based on anti-Islamic conspiracy theories, noting that &quot;Two previous U.S. administrations concluded that it does not engage in terrorism, as did a recent report by the British government.&quot;

Ishaan Tharoor of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; condemned the movement to designate the Brotherhood as a terrorist group.

A Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) intelligence report from January 2017 warned that designation of the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization &quot;may fuel extremism&quot; and harm relations with U.S. allies. The report noted that the Brotherhood had &quot;rejected violence as a matter of official policy and opposed al-Qa&#x27;ida and ISIS&quot; and that while &quot;a minority of MB [Muslim Brotherhood] members have engaged in violence, most often in response to harsh regime repression, perceived foreign occupation, or civil conflicts&quot;, designation of the organization as a terrorist group would prompt concern from U.S. allies in the Middle East &quot;that such a step could destabilize their internal politics, feed extremist narratives, and anger Muslims worldwide.&quot; The CIA analysis stated: &quot;MB groups enjoy widespread support across the Near East-North Africa region and many Arabs and Muslims worldwide would view an MB designation as an affront to their core religious and societal values. Moreover, a US designation would probably weaken MB leaders&#x27; arguments against violence and provide ISIS and al-Qa&#x27;ida additional grist for propaganda to win followers and support, particularly for attacks against US interests.&quot;

An article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; against designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization was written by Shadi Hamid.

===Relationship to diplomatic crises in Qatar===
{{see also|Foreign relations of Qatar}}

Qatar&#x27;s relationship with Muslim Brotherhood has been a persistent point of contention between Qatar and other Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, and Egypt, which view the Brotherhood as a serious threat to social stability in those countries.

Following the overthrow of Mohamed Morsi in July 2013, Qatar allowed some Brotherhood members who fled Egypt to live in the country. The Qatar-based Al Jazeera &quot;housed them in a five-star Doha hotel and granted them regular airtime for promoting their cause&quot;; the station also broadcast protests against the post-Brotherhood authorities in Egypt by the Brotherhood, &quot;and in some cases allegedly paid Muslim Brothers for the footage.&quot; Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Bahrain said that Qatar had violated the Gulf Cooperation Council rule against interference in the internal affairs of other members, and in March 2014 all three countries withdrew their ambassadors from Qatar. After two months of diplomatic tensions the issue was resolved, with Brotherhood leaders departing from Doha later in 2014.

However, &quot;from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the UAE&#x27;s standpoint, Qatar never lived up to the 2014 agreement and continued to serve as the nexus of the Brotherhood&#x27;s regional networks.&quot; This led to the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis, which is viewed as being precipitated in large part by a conflict over the Muslim Brotherhood. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt made 13 demands of the government of Qatar, six of which reflect the group&#x27;s opposition to Qatar&#x27;s relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood and demand that the country cut ties to the Brotherhood.

<doc id="20746" wikidata="Q13702" url="?curid=20746" title="Moctezuma I">
<text>Moctezuma I (–1469), also known as Montezuma I, Moteuczomatzin Ilhuicamina ( ) or Huehuemoteuczoma ( ), was the second Aztec emperor and fifth king of Tenochtitlan. During his reign, the Aztec Empire was consolidated, major expansion was undertaken, and Tenochtitlan started becoming the dominant partner of the Aztec Triple Alliance. Often mistaken for his popular descendant, Moctezuma II, Moctezuma I greatly contributed to the famed Aztec Empire that thrived until Spanish arrival, and he ruled over a period of peace from 1440 to 1453. Moctezuma brought social, economical, and political reform to strengthen Aztec rule, and Tenochtitlan benefited from relations with other cities.

== Ancestry ==
Moctezuma was the son of emperor Huitzilihuitl (meaning &#x27;Hummingbird Feather&#x27;) and queen Miahuaxihuitl. He was a brother of Chimalpopoca, Tlacaelel I, and Huehue Zaca. He was the grandson of the first ruler of Tenochtitlan. His name meant &#x27;he is angry like a lord&#x27; (from the root &#x27;lord&#x27; combined with the reflexive verb &#x27;becomes angry&#x27;).

== Accession and coronation ==
After emperor Huitzilihuitl&#x27;s death, Moctezuma&#x27;s brother Chimalpopoca ruled for ten years until his assassination. During his reign, Moctezuma and his brother Tlacaelel I led an opposition group of young nobles. This group was militant in nature, and they chose his half-uncle Itzcoatl as the next ruler. Under Itzcoatl, Moctezuma and Tlacaelel were generals in his army.

Moctezuma then was elected to power in 1440 by this group of nobles at the age of 42, after the death of Itzcoatl. He held the title of &quot;Great Speaker&quot;. This was distinguished from the title of &quot;Speaker&quot; since he spoke for both the Aztecs and the other peoples under their control.

His coronation was a large ceremony, involving many human sacrifices of prisoners. Moctezuma was seated on a basketwork throne and was crowned by the ruler of Texoco. His crown was a turquoise diadem known as the fire crown.

== Reign ==
As &quot;tlatoani&quot;, Moctezuma solidified the alliance with two neighboring states, Tlacopan (a small city-state) and Texcoco. Tlacopan, located on the western shore of Lake Texcoco, controlled seven city-states to the northwest, while Texcoco was located on the eastern shore and rule over nine city-states in the northeast. As the two regions were added to Moctezuma&#x27;s empire, the Aztecs relied on already established city-states to increase military power. In this skillfully crafted Triple Alliance, 2/5ths of the spoils would go to Tenochtitlan and another 2/5ths to Texcoco, with the remaining 1/5 given to Tlacopan.

Among the Aztecs&#x27; greatest achievements, Moctezuma and Nezahualcoyotl of Texcoco organized the construction and completion of a double aqueduct pipe system, supplying the city of Tenochtitlan with fresh water. This provided an ample supply of fresh water to Texcoco&#x27;s various communities, which extended over a distance of from their lakeshore to the hills of Tetxcotxinco.

Early in his rule, he conquered the state of Oaxaca in 1445. Moctezuma then went on to extend the boundaries of the Aztec empire beyond the Valley of México to the Gulf Coast, known as the &quot;Sea of the Sky&quot;, for the first time, subjugating the Huastec people and Totonac peoples and thereby gaining access to exotic goods such as cocoa, rubber, cotton, fruits, feathers, and seashells. The Aztec were then known as the &quot;Neighbors of the Sea of the Sky&quot;, as they controlled all the territory up to the Gulf of Mexico.

=== Natural disasters ===
As a ruler, Moctezuma faced and overcame many natural disasters. In 1446, a swarm of locusts destroyed the region&#x27;s crops In 1449, Lake Texcoco flooded the city. In 1450, a frost and drought again destroyed the region&#x27;s crops. These droughts and frosts continued for four years. The famines resulted in some selling their children or themselves into slavery, and the city lost most of its population. This drought resulted in Moctezuma&#x27;s period of peace ending.

=== Flower War ===

After the famine ravaged through Aztec agricultural resources, a series of conflicts, known as the Flower War, involved the Triple Alliance and the city-states of Huejotzingo, Tlaxcala, Cholula, in the Tlaxcala-Pueblan Valley of central Mexico. Believing the famine to have occurred due to their gods&#x27; anger, Moctezuma supported the order for an increase of human sacrifices to please them. Thus began the war to accumulate as many victims as possible for sacrifice. The war lasted until the Spanish arrived and recruited enemies of the Triple Alliance to conquer all of Mexico. In preparation for the war, Moctezuma would issue three declarations of war and provide weapons to the enemy region. If the last declaration was not accepted by the enemy region, then within 20 days the Aztecs would attack.

===Expeditions as ruler===
In the 1450s, Aztec forces under Moctezuma would invade the Valley of Oaxaca in a bid to extend Aztec hegemony. In about 1458, Moctezuma led an expedition into Mixtec territory against the city-state of Coixtlahuaca. The Mixtecs were defeated, despite the support of contingents of Tlaxcala and Huexotzinco warriors, traditional enemies of the Aztecs. While most of the defeated princes were allowed to retain their positions, the Mixtec ruler Atonal was ritually strangled and his family was taken as slaves. The Codex Mendoza records that the tribute owed by Coixtlahuaca consisted of 2000 blankets (of five types), two military outfits with headdresses and shields, green gemstone beads, 800 bunches of green feathers, 40 bags of cochineal dye, and 20 bowls of gold dust. He took many girls from Coixtlahuaca and had ten harems all to himself. He stole three of them from his dead brother Huehue Zaca. Similar campaigns were conducted against Cosamaloapan, Ahuilizapan (Orizaba), and Cuetlachtlan (Cotaxtla).

=== Opposition to his reign ===
It is reported that Moctezuma&#x27;s half-brother Tlacaelel opposed his leadership in the early years. However, other historians report that he was once given the opportunity to rule and turned the opportunity down. He took over the empire in 1469 after the death of Moctezuma.

=== Social, political, and economic reforms ===
While Moctezuma did lead conquests against others, he was able to maintain peace from 1440 to 1453 within his empire. With this peace, his government was able to enact social, political, and economic reforms.

He enacted codes which determined what people of certain classes could wear and what their houses could look like. For example, only noblemen or great warriors could have a home with a second story. No one was allowed to have towers, because he claimed they could only be granted by the gods.

He also created legal and education policies that were determined by class. In the palace, different classes were to be received in different rooms. No mixing was allowed under the punishment of death. Only Moctezuma was allowed to give a death sentence, and all judges had to notify him of any death penalty rulings. Religion was also emphasized, and religious schools were required in every neighborhood.

==Descendants and legacy==
This Moctezuma was an ancestor of Moctezuma II, who met Hernan Cortes.

Moctezuma was succeeded by his daughter Atotoztli, who was either Tlatoani or regent for her son Axayacatl. Moctezuma is also now used as a symbol of Mexican independence and resistance. Moctezuma I is depicted less than Moctezuma II in popular culture, but he has appeared in strategy games such as the &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization&quot; series and Rise of Kingdoms.

Moctezuma is also seen as a &quot;hero-god&quot; by several Southwestern Native American tribes, especially the Tohono O&#x27;odham and Pueblo. His legend is somewhat distinct from the actual historical figure, but shares elements of him and likely originated with tales of the real one. He is a somewhat ambiguous Noah figure, who is subservient to the Great Spirit.

<text>Moctezuma Xocoyotzin ( – 29 June 1520), retroactively referred to in European sources as Moctezuma II, was the ninth emperor of the Aztec Empire (also known as the Mexica Empire), reigning from 1502 or 1503 to 1520. Through his marriage with Queen Tlapalizquixochtzin of Ecatepec, one of his two wives, he was also the king consort of that &quot;altepetl&quot;.

The first contact between the indigenous civilizations of Mesoamerica and Europeans took place during his reign. He was killed during the initial stages of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire when Hernán Cortés, the Spanish conquistador, and his men seized the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. During his reign, the Aztec Empire reached its greatest size. Through warfare, Moctezuma expanded the territory as far south as Xoconosco in Chiapas and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and incorporated the Zapotec and Yopi people into the empire. He changed the previous meritocratic system of social hierarchy and widened the divide between &quot;pipiltin&quot; (nobles) and &quot;macehualtin&quot; (commoners) by prohibiting commoners from working in the royal palaces.

Though two other Aztec rulers succeeded Moctezuma after his death, their reigns were short-lived and the empire quickly collapsed under them. Historical portrayals of Moctezuma have mostly been colored by his role as ruler of a defeated nation, and many sources have described him as weak-willed, superstitious, and indecisive. However, depictions of his person among his contemporaries are divided; some depict him as one of the greatest leaders Mexico had, a great conqueror who tried his best to maintain his nation together at times of crisis, while others depict him as a tyrant who wanted to take absolute control over the whole empire. Accounts of how he died and who were the perpetrators (Spaniards or natives) differ. His story remains one of the most well-known conquest narratives from the history of European contact with Native Americans, and he has been mentioned or portrayed in numerous works of historical fiction and popular culture.

==Name==

The Classical Nahuatl pronunciation of his name is . It is a compound of a noun meaning &#x27;lord&#x27; and a verb meaning &#x27;to frown in anger&#x27;, and so is interpreted as &#x27;he frowns like a lord&#x27; or &#x27;he who is angry in a noble manner&#x27;. His name glyph, shown in the upper left corner of the image from the &quot;Codex Mendoza&quot; below, was composed of a diadem () on straight hair with an attached earspool, a separate nosepiece, and a speech scroll.

===Regnal number===
The Aztecs did not use regnal numbers; they were given retroactively by historians to more easily distinguish him from the first Moctezuma, referred to as Moctezuma I. The Aztec chronicles called him , while the first was called or (&#x27;Old Moctezuma&#x27;). () means &#x27;honored young one&#x27; (from &#x27;younger son&#x27; + suffix added to nouns or personal names when speaking about them with deference).

== Biography ==

===Ancestry and early life===

Moctezuma II was the great-grandson of Moctezuma I through his daughter Atotoztli II and her husband Huehue Tezozómoc (not to be confused with the Tepanec leader). According to some sources, Tezozómoc was the son of emperor Itzcóatl, which would make Moctezuma his great-grandson, but other sources claim that Tezozómoc was Chimalpopoca&#x27;s son, thus nephew of Itzcóatl, and a lord in Ecatepec. Moctezuma was also Nezahualcóyotl&#x27;s grandson; he was a son of emperor Axayácatl and one of Nezahualcóyotl&#x27;s daughters, Izelcoatzin or Xochicueyetl. Two of his uncles were Tízoc and Ahuizotl, the two previous emperors.

As was customary among Mexica nobles, Moctezuma was educated in the Calmecac, the educational institution for the nobility. He would have been enrolled into the institution at a very early age, likely at the age of five years, as the sons of the kings were expected to receive their education at a much earlier age than the rest of the population. According to some sources, Moctezuma stood out in his childhood for his discipline during his education, finishing his works correctly and being devout to the Aztec religion.

Moctezuma was an already famous warrior by the time he became the &quot;tlatoani&quot; of Mexico, holding the high rank of &quot;tlacatecuhtli&quot; (lord of men) and/or &quot;tlacochcalcatl&quot; (person from the house of darts) in the Mexica military, and thus his election was largely influenced by his military career and religious influence as a priest, as he was also the main priest of Huitzilopochtli&#x27;s temple.
One example of a celebrated campaign in which he participated before ascending to the throne was during the last stages of the conquest of Ayotlan, during Ahuizotl&#x27;s reign in the late 15th century. During this campaign, which lasted 4 years, a group of Mexica &quot;pochteca&quot; merchants were put under siege by the enemy forces. This was important because the merchants were closely related to Ahuizotl and served as military commanders and soldiers themselves when needed. To rescue the merchants, Ahuizotl sent then-prince Moctezuma with many soldiers to fight against the enemies, though the fight was brief, as the people of Ayotlan surrendered to the Mexica shortly after he arrived.

Approximately in the year 1490, Moctezuma obtained the rank of &quot;tequihua&quot;, which was reached by capturing at least 4 enemy commanders.

===Coronation===

The year in which Moctezuma was crowned is uncertain. Most historians suggest the year 1502 to be most likely, though some have argued in favor of the year 1503. A work currently held at the Art Institute of Chicago known as the Stone of the Five Suns is an inscription written in stone representing the Five Suns and a date le 11 reed, which is equivalent to 15 July 1503 in the Gregorian calendar. Some historians believe this to be the exact date on which the coronation took place, as it is also included in some primary sources. Other dates have been given from the same year; Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxóchitl states that the coronation took place on 24 May 1503. However, most documents say Moctezuma&#x27;s coronation happened in the year 1502, and therefore most historians believe this to have been the actual date.

==Reign==

After his coronation, Moctezuma set up thirty-eight more provincial divisions, largely to centralize the empire. He sent out bureaucrats, accompanied by military garrisons, who made sure tax was being paid, national laws were being upheld and served as local judges in case of disagreement.

===Internal policy===
====Natural disasters====
Moctezuma&#x27;s reign began with difficulties. In the year 1505, a major drought resulted in widespread crop failure, and thus a large portion of the population of central Mexico began to starve. One of the few places in the empire not affected by this drought was Totonacapan, and many people from Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco sought refuge in this region to avoid starvation. Large amounts of maize were brought from this area to aid the population. Moctezuma and the lords of Texcoco and Tlacopan, Nezahualpilli, and Totoquihuatzin, attempted to aid the population during the disaster, including using all available food supplies to feed the population and raising tributes for one year. The drought and famine ultimately lasted three years, and at some point became so severe that some noblemen reportedly sold their children as slaves in exchange for food to avoid starvation. Moctezuma ordered the &quot;tlacxitlan&quot;, the criminal court of Tenochtitlan (which aside from judging criminals also had the job of freeing &quot;unjustified&quot; slaves), to free those children and offer food to those noblemen. Another natural disaster, of lesser intensity, occurred in the winter of 1514, when a series of dangerous snowstorms resulted in the destruction of various crops and property across Mexico.

====Policies and other events during his reign====
During his government, he applied multiple policies that centered the government of the empire on his person, though it is difficult to tell exactly to which extent those policies were applied, as the records written about such policies tend to be affected by propaganda in favor of or against his person.

According to Alva Ixtlilxóchitl, among Moctezuma&#x27;s policies were the replacement of a large portion of his court (including most of his advisors) with people he deemed preferable, and increasing the division between the commoner and noble classes, which included the refusal to offer certain honors to various politicians and warriors for being commoners. He also prohibited any commoners or illegitimate children of the nobility from serving in his palace or high positions of government. This was contrary to the policies of his predecessors, who did allow commoners to serve in such positions.

Moctezuma&#x27;s elitism can be attributed to a long conflict of interests between the nobility, merchants, and warrior class. The struggle occurred as the result of the conflicting interests between the merchants and the nobility and the rivalry between the warrior class and the nobility for positions of power in the government. Moctezuma likely sought to resolve this conflict by installing despotist policies that would settle it. However, it is also true that many of his elitist policies were put in place because he did not want to &quot;work with inferior people&quot;, and instead wanted to be served by and interact with people he deemed more prestigious, both to avoid giving himself and the government a bad reputation and to work with people he trusted better. However, some of his policies also affected the nobility, as he had intentions of reforming it so that it would not pose a potential threat to the government; among these policies was the obligation of the nobility to reside permanently in Tenochtitlan and abandon their homes if they lived elsewhere.

Regarding his economic policies, Moctezuma&#x27;s rule was largely affected by natural disasters in the early years. As mentioned before, the famine during his first years as &quot;tlatoani&quot; resulted in a temporary increase in tribute in some provinces to aid the population. Some provinces, however, ended up paying more tribute permanently, most likely as the result of his primary military focus shifting from territorial expansion to stabilization of the empire through the suppression of rebellions. Most of the provinces affected by these new tributary policies were in the Valley of Mexico. For example, the province of Amaquemecan, which formed part of the Chalco region, was assigned to pay an additional tribute of stone and wood twice or thrice a year for Tenochtitlan&#x27;s building projects. This tributary policy eventually backfired, as some of the empire&#x27;s subjects grew disgruntled with Moctezuma&#x27;s government and launched rebellions against him, which eventually resulted in many of these provinces—including Totonacapan (under the &quot;de facto&quot; leadership of Chicomacatl), Chalco and Mixquic (which were near Tenochtitlan)—forming alliances with Spain against him.

The famine at the beginning of his rule also resulted in the abolishment of the &quot;huehuetlatlacolli&quot; system, which was a system of serfdom in which a family agreed to maintain a &quot;tlacohtli&quot; (slave or serf) perpetually. This agreement also turned the descendants of the ones who agreed into serfs.

During his campaign against Jaltepec and Cuatzontlan (&quot;see below&quot;), he made negotiations with the Tlatelolca to obtain the weapons and resources needed. As a result of these negotiations, Tlatelolco was given more sovereignty; they were permitted to rebuild their main temple which was partially destroyed in the Battle of Tlatelolco in a civil war during Axayácatl&#x27;s reign, act largely independently during military campaigns, and be absolved from paying tribute.

Many of these policies were planned together with his uncle Tlilpotonqui, &quot;cihuacoatl&quot; of Mexico and son of Tlacaelel, at the beginning of his reign, while others, such as his tributary policies, were created as the result of various events, like the famine which occurred at the beginning of his rule. His policies, in general, had the purpose of centralizing the government in his person through the means of implementing policies to settle the divide between the nobility and commoners and abolishing some of the more feudal policies of his predecessors, while also making his tributary policies more severe to aid the population during natural disasters and to compensate for a less expansionist focus in his military campaigns.

Most of the policies implemented during his rule would not last long after his death, as the empire fell into Spanish control on 13 August 1521 as a result of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, one year after he died. The new Spanish authorities implemented their laws and removed many of the political establishments founded during the pre-Hispanic era, leaving just a few in place. Among the few policies that lasted was the divide between the nobility and the commoners, as members of the pre-Hispanic nobility continued to enjoy various privileges under the Viceroyalty of New Spain, such as land ownership through a system known as &quot;cacicazgo&quot;.

====Construction projects====

Moctezuma, like many of his predecessors, built a &quot;tecpan&quot; (palace) of his own. This was a particularly large palace, which was somewhat larger than the National Palace that exists today which was built over it, being about 200 meters long and 200 meters wide. However, little archaeological evidence exists to understand what his palace looked like, but the various descriptions of it and the space it covered have helped reconstruct various features of its layout. Even so, these descriptions tend to be limited, as many writers were unable to describe them in detail. The Spanish captain Hernán Cortés, the main commander of the Spanish troops that entered Mexico in the year 1519, himself stated in his letters to the king of Spain that he would not bother describing it, claiming that it &quot;was so marvelous that it seems to me impossible to describe its excellence.&quot;

The palace had a large courtyard that opened into the central plaza of the city to the north, where Templo Mayor was. This courtyard was a place where hundreds of courtiers would hold multiple sorts of activities, including feasts and waiting for royal business to be conducted. This courtyard had suites of rooms that surrounded smaller courtyards and gardens.
His residence had many rooms for various purposes. Aside from his room, at the central part of the upper floor, there were two rooms beside it which were known as &quot;coacalli&quot; (guest house). One of these rooms was built for the lords of Tlacopan and Texcoco, the other two members of the Triple Alliance, who came to visit. The other room was for the lords of Colhuacan, Tenayohcan (today known as Tenayuca) and Chicuhnautlan (today, ). The exact reason why this room had this purpose remains uncertain, though a few records like Codex Mendoza say the reason was that these lords were personal friends of Moctezuma. There was also another room which became known as (Spanish: Moctezuma&#x27;s Black House), a room with no windows and fully painted black which was used by Moctezuma to meditate. Remains of this room have been found in recent years in modern Mexico City. The upper floor had a large courtyard which was likely used as a &quot;cuicacalli&quot;, for public shows during religious rituals. The bottom floor had two rooms which were used by the government. One of them was used for Moctezuma&#x27;s advisors and judges who dealt with the situations of the commoners (likely the &quot;Tlacxitlan&quot;). The other room was for the war council (likely the &quot;Tequihuacalli&quot;), where high-ranking warriors planned and commanded their battles.

As part of the construction of Moctezuma&#x27;s palace, various projects were made which made it more prestigious by providing entertainment to the public.
One of the most famous among these projects was the &quot;&quot; (House of Birds), a zoo which had multiple sorts of animals, mainly avian species, but also contained several predatory animals in their section. These animals were taken care of by servants who cleaned their environments, fed them, and offered them care according to their species. The species of birds held within the zoo were widely varied, holding animals like quetzals, eagles, true parrots, and others, and also included water species like roseate spoonbills and various others that had their pond.

The section with animals other than birds, which was decorated with figures of gods associated with the wild, was also considerably varied, having jaguars, wolves, snakes, and other smaller predatory animals. These animals were fed on hunted animals like deer, turkeys, and other smaller animals. Allegedly, the dead bodies of sacrificial victims were also used to feed these animals, and after the battle known as La Noche Triste, which occurred during the early stages of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire in June 1520 (during which Moctezuma died), the bodies of dead Spaniards may have been used to feed them.

This place was highly prestigious, and all sorts of important people are said to have used to visit this place, including artists, craftsmen, government officials, and blacksmiths.

The &quot;Totocalli&quot;, however, was burnt and destroyed, along with many other constructions, in the year 1521 during the Siege of Tenochtitlan, as the Spanish captain Hernán Cortés ordered for many of the buildings that formed part of the royal palaces to be burnt to demoralize the Mexica army and civilians. Though Cortés himself admitted that he enjoyed the zoo, he stated that he saw it as a necessary measure in his third letter to King Charles I of Spain.

Another construction was the Chapultepec aqueduct, built in 1506 to bring fresh water directly from Chapultepec to Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco. This water was driven to the merchant ports of the city for people to drink and to the temples. This aqueduct was destroyed less than a year after Moctezuma&#x27;s death, during the Siege of Tenochtitlan in 1521, as the Spaniards decided to destroy it to cut Tenochtitlan&#x27;s water supply. Some Mexica warriors attempted to resist its destruction, but were repelled by the Tlaxcalan allies of the Spanish.

===Territorial expansion during his rule, military actions and foreign policy===

At the beginning of his rule, he attempted to build diplomatic ties with Tlaxcala, Huexotzinco (today, Huejotzingo), Chollolan (Cholula), Michoacan, and Metztitlán, by secretly inviting the lords of these countries to attend the celebrations for his coronation before the continuation of the flower wars, which were wars of religious nature arranged voluntarily by the parties involved with no territorial purposes, but instead to capture and sacrifice as many soldiers as possible. During this period, Mexico and Tlaxcala still were not at war, but the tension between these nations was high, and the embassy sent for this purpose was put in a highly risky situation, for which reason Moctezuma chose as members of the embassy only experts in diplomacy, espionage, and languages. Fortunately, his invitation was accepted, and Moctezuma used this opportunity to show his greatness to the lords who attended. However, because the invitation was secret to avoid a scandal for inviting his rivals to this ceremony, Moctezuma ordered that no one should know that the lords were present, not even the rulers of Tlacopan (today known as Tacuba) and Texcoco, and the lords saw themselves often forced to pretend to be organizers to avoid confusion. Though Moctezuma would continue to hold meetings with these people, where various religious rituals were held, it did not take long for large-scale conflicts to erupt between these nations.

An important thing to note is that contrary to popular belief, Tlaxcala was not Mexico&#x27;s most powerful rival in the central Mexican region in this period, and it would not be so until the final years of pre-Hispanic Mexico in 1518–19. In the opening years of the 16th century, Huejotzingo was Mexico&#x27;s actual military focus, and it proved itself to be one of the most powerful political entities until these final years, as a series of devastating wars weakened the state into being conquered by Tlaxcala.

During his reign, he married the queen of Ecatepec, Tlapalizquixochtzin, making him king consort of this &quot;altepetl&quot;, though according to the chronicle written by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, very few people in Mexico knew about this political role, being only a few among his closest courtiers among those who knew.

====Early military campaigns====

The first military campaign during his rule, which was done in honor of his coronation, was the violent suppression of a rebellion in Nopala and Icpatepec. For this war, a force of over 60,000 soldiers from Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, Tepanec lands, Chalco, and Xochimilco participated, and Moctezuma himself went to the frontlines. Approximately 5100 prisoners were taken after the campaign, many of whom were given to inhabitants of Tenochtitlan and Chalco as slaves, while the rest were sacrificed in his honor on the fourth day of his coronation. In Nopala, Mexica soldiers committed a massacre and burned down the temples and houses, going against Moctezuma&#x27;s wishes. After the campaign, celebrations for his coronation continued in Tenochtitlan. Moctezuma&#x27;s territorial expansion, however, would not truly begin until another rebellion was suppressed in Tlachquiauhco (today known as Tlaxiaco), where its ruler, Malinalli, was killed after trying to start the rebellion. In this campaign, all adults above the age of 50 within the city were killed under Moctezuma&#x27;s orders as he blamed them for the rebellion. A characteristic fact about Moctezuma&#x27;s wars was that a large portion of them had the purpose of suppressing rebellions rather than conquering new territory, contrary to his predecessors, whose main focus was territorial expansion.

====Rebellions====

During his reign, multiple rebellions were suppressed by the use of force and often ended with violent results. As mentioned previously, the first campaign during his reign, which was done in honor of his coronation, was the suppression of a rebellion in Nopallan (today known as Santos Reyes Nopala) and Icpatepec (a Mixtec town that no longer exists which was near Silacayoapam), both in modern-day Oaxaca. The prisoners taken during this campaign were later used as slaves or for human sacrifice.

After Mexico suffered a humiliating defeat at Atlixco during a flower war against Huejotzingo (&quot;see below&quot;), many sites in Oaxaca rebelled, likely under the idea that the empire&#x27;s forces were weakened. However, Moctezuma was able to raise an army numbering 200,000 and marched over the city of Yancuitlan (today known as Yanhuitlan), a city which had been previously conquered by Tizoc, and conquered Zozollan in the process. Abundant territorial expansion was carried out following this.

Another notable rebellion occurred in Atlixco (in modern-day Puebla), a city neighboring Tlaxcala which had previously been conquered by Ahuizotl. This rebellion occurred in 1508, and was repressed by a prince named Macuilmalinatzin. This wasn&#x27;t the first conflict that occurred in this region, as its proximity with Tlaxcala and Huejotzingo would cause multiple conflicts to erupt in this area during Moctezuma&#x27;s reign.

A large series of rebellions occurred in 1510, likely as a result of astrological predictions halting some Mexica military operations to a degree. Moctezuma would try to campaign against these rebellions one at a time throughout the following years, campaigning against territories in Oaxaca, including Icpatepec again, in 1511 or 1512. Some of these revolts occurred as far south as Xoconochco (today known as Soconusco) and Huiztlan (today, Huixtla), far down where the Mexican-Guatemalan border is today. These territories were highly important to the empire and had been previously conquered by his predecessor Ahuizotl, thus Moctezuma had to maintain them under his control. These revolts occurred in so many locations that the empire was unable to deal with all of them effectively.

====Territorial expansion====
The empire&#x27;s expansion during Moctezuma&#x27;s rule was mainly focused on southwestern Mesoamerican territories, in Oaxaca and modern-day Guerrero. The earliest conquests in this territory were held by Moctezuma I.

The first important conquest during Moctezuma&#x27;s rule occurred in the year 1504 when the city of Achiotlan (today known as San Juan Achiutla) was conquered. This war, according to some sources, was supposedly mainly caused by &quot;a small tree which belonged to a lord of the place which grew such beautiful flowers Moctezuma&#x27;s envy couldn&#x27;t resist it&quot;, and when Moctezuma asked for it, the lord of the city refused to offer it, thus starting the war. After the conquest, this tree was supposedly taken to Tenochtitlan. The second conquest occurred in Zozollan, a place neighboring east of Achiutla, on 28 May 1506, during the campaign against the Yanhuitlan rebellion. This conquest had a particularly violent result, as a special sacrifice was held after the campaign where the prisoners captured in Zozollan were the victims. &quot;The Mexicans killed many of the people from Zozola which they captured in war&quot;, according to old sources.

In the year 1507, the year of the New Fire Ceremony, abundant military action occurred. Among the towns that are listed to have been conquered this year are: Tecuhtepec (from which multiple prisoners were sacrificed for the ceremony), Iztitlan, Nocheztlan (an important town northeast of Achiutla), Quetzaltepec, and Tototepec.

The conquest of Tototepec formed part of the conquests of some of the last few Tlapanec territories of modern-day Guerrero, an area which had already been in decline since Moctezuma I began his first campaigns in the region and probably turned the Kingdom of Tlachinollan (modern-day Tlapa) into a tributary province during the rule of Lord Tlaloc between 1461 and 1467 (though the kingdom would not be invaded and fully conquered until the reign of Ahuizotl in 1486, along with Caltitlan, a city neighboring west of Tlapa). In between the years of 1503 and 1509, a campaign was launched against Xipetepec, and another was launched (as mentioned previously) in 1507 against Tototepec, which had previously been a territory conquered by Tlachinollan in the mid-14th century. The campaign in Tototepec occurred as the result of a large group of Mexica merchants sent by Moctezuma being killed after they attempted to trade for some of the resources of the area on his behalf. During the conquest of Tototepec, two important Mexica noblemen, Ixtlilcuechahuac and Huitzilihuitzin (not to be confused with the &quot;tlatoani&quot; of this name), were killed. All the population of Tototepec, except for the children, was massacred by the Mexica forces, and about 1350 captives were taken. Another campaign was launched in 1515 to conquer Acocozpan and Tetenanco and reconquer Atlitepec, which had been previously conquered by Ahuizotl in 1493.
Quetzaltepec was conquered on the same campaign as Tototepec, as both reportedly murdered the merchants sent by Moctezuma in the area. The Mexica managed to raise an army of 400,000 and first conquered Tototepec. Quetzaltepec was also conquered, but it rebelled along with various sites across Oaxaca soon after when the Mexica lost the Battle of Atlixco against Huejotzingo. Being a fortified city with six walls, the Mexica put the city under siege for several days, with the each of groups of the Triple Alliance attacking from various locations and having over 200 wooden ladders constructed under Moctezuma&#x27;s orders. The Mexica eventually emerged victorious, successfully conquering the city.

Several military defeats occurred in some of these expansionist campaigns, however, such as the invasion of Amatlan in 1509, where an unexpected series of snowstorms and blizzards killed many soldiers, making the surviving ones too low in numbers to fight.

An important campaign was the conquest of Xaltepec (today known as Jaltepec) and Cuatzontlan and the suppression of the last revolt in Icpatepec, all in Oaxaca. This war started as the result of provocations given by Jaltepec against Moctezuma through killing as many Mexicas as they could find in their area, as some sort of way to challenge him, and the beginning of the revolt by Icpatepec as the result. The Xaltepeca had done this before with previous &quot;tlatoanis&quot; and other nations. Moctezuma and the recently elected ruler of Tlacopan themselves went to the fight, along with Tlacaelel&#x27;s grandson and &quot;cihuacoatl&quot; of Mexico in this period Tlacaeleltzin Xocoyotl. A large portion of the weapons and food was brought by Tlatelolco, though they were initially hesitant to do so, but were ordered by Moctezuma to offer it as a tribute to Tenochtitlan, and they received multiple rewards as the result, including the permission to rebuild their main temple (which had been partially destroyed during the Battle of Tlatelolco which occurred during Axayacatl&#x27;s reign). This campaign had a highly violent result; Moctezuma, after receiving information on the cities gathered by his spies, ordered for all adults in the sites above the age of 50 to be killed to prevent a rebellion once the cities were conquered, similar to the war in Tlachquiauhco. The conquest was done by dividing the army that was brought in 3 divisions; one from Tlacopan, one from Texcoco, and one from Tenochtitlan, so that each one attacked a different city. The Tenochtitlan company attacked Jaltepec. Moctezuma came out victorious and then returned to Mexico through Chalco, where he received many honors for his victory. This war likely happened in 1511, as a war against Icpatepec is recorded to have happened again in that year.

After the campaigns in the Oaxaca region, Moctezuma began to move his campaigns into northern and eastern territories around 1514, conquering the site of Quetzalapan, a Chichimec territory through the Huastec region, taking 1332 captives and suffering minimal casualties, with only 95 reported losses. Likely around this time, many other territories in the region were also conquered. He also went to war against the Tarascan Empire for the first time since Axayácatl was defeated in his disastrous invasion. This war caused high casualties on both sides. The Mexica succeeded at taking a large amount of captives, but failed to conquer any territory.

Among the final military campaigns carried out by Moctezuma, aside from the late stages of the war against Tlaxcala, were the conquests of Mazatzintlan and Zacatepec, which formed part of the Chichimec region.
The approximate number of military engagements during his rule before European contact was 73, achieving victory in approximately 43 sites (including territories already within the empire), making him one of the most active monarchs in pre-Hispanic Mexican history in terms of military actions.

However, his rule and policies suffered a very sudden interruption upon the news of the arrival of Spanish ships in the east in 1519 (&quot;see below&quot;).

==Texcoco crisis==
One of the most controversial events during his reign was the supposed overthrow of the legitimate government of Nezahualpilli in Texcoco. Historians such as Alva Ixtlilxóchitl even went as far as referring to this action as &quot;diabolical&quot;, while also making claims that are not seen in other chronicles and are generally not trusted by modern historians.

===Nezahualpilli&#x27;s death===

The circumstances of Nezahualpilli&#x27;s death are not clear, and many sources offer highly conflicting stories about the events that resulted in it.

According to Alva Ixtlilxóchitl, the issue began when Moctezuma sent an embassy to Nezahualpilli reprimanding him for not sacrificing any Tlaxcalan prisoners since the last 4 years, during the war with Tlaxcala (&quot;see below&quot;), threatening him saying that he was angering the gods. Nezahualpilli replied to this embassy stating that the reason he had not sacrificed them was that he simply did not want to wage war because he and his population wanted to live peacefully for the time being, as the ceremonies that would be held in the following year, 1 reed, would make war inevitable, and that soon his wishes would be granted. Eventually, Nezahualpilli launched a campaign against Tlaxcala, though he did not go himself, instead sending two of his sons, Acatlemacoctzin and Tecuanehuatzin, as commanders. Moctezuma then decided to betray Nezahualpilli by sending a secret embassy to Tlaxcala telling them about the incoming army. The Tlaxcalans then began to take action against the Texcoca while they were unaware of this betrayal. The Texcoco armies were ambushed in the middle of the night. Almost none of the Texcoca survived the fight. Upon receiving the news of Moctezuma&#x27;s betrayal, understanding that nothing could be done about it and fearing for the future of his people, Nezahualpilli committed suicide in his palace.

This story, however, as mentioned before, is not generally trusted by modern historians, and much of the information given contradicts other sources.

Sources do agree, however, that Nezahualpilli&#x27;s last years as ruler were mainly characterized by his attempts to live a peaceful life, likely as the result of his old age. He spent his last months mostly inactive in his rule and his advisors, on his request, took most of the government&#x27;s decisions during this period. He assigned two men (of whom details are mostly unknown) to take control of almost all government decisions. These sources also agree that he was found dead in his palace, but the cause of his death remains uncertain.

His death is recorded to have been mourned in Texcoco, Tenochtitlan, Tlacopan, and even Chalco and Xochimilco, as all of these &quot;altepeme&quot; gave precious offerings, like jewelry and clothes, and sacrifices in his honor. Moctezuma himself was reported to have broken into tears upon receiving the news of his death. His death was mourned for 80 days. This was recorded as one of the largest funeral ceremonies in pre-Hispanic Mexican history.

===Succession crisis===
====Elections====

Since Nezahualipilli died abruptly in the year 1516, he left no indication as to who his successor would be. He had six legitimate sons: Cacamatzin, Coanacochtli (later baptized as Don Pedro), Tecocoltzin (baptized as Don Hernando), Ixtlilxochitl II (baptized as Don Hernando), Yoyontzin (baptized as Don Jorge) and Tetlahuehuetzquititzin (baptized as Don Pedro), all of whom would eventually take the throne, though most of them after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. His most likely heir was Tetlahuehuetzquititzin, as he was the wealthiest among Nezahualpilli&#x27;s sons, but he was considered inept for the job. His other most likely heirs were Ixtlilxochitl, Coanacochtli, and Cacamatzin, though not everyone supported them as they were considerably younger than Tetlahuehuetzquititzin, as Ixtlilxochitl was 19 years old and Cacamatzin was about 21. Moctezuma supported Cacamatzin since he was his nephew. In the end, the Texcoco council voted in favor of Moctezuma&#x27;s decision, and Cacamatzin was declared &quot;tlatoani&quot;, being that he was the son of Moctezuma&#x27;s sister Xocotzin and was older than his two other brothers. Though Coanacochtli felt the decision was fair, Ixtlilxochitl disagreed with the results and protested against the council. Ixtlilxochitl argued that the reason why Moctezuma supported Cacamatzin was because he wanted to manipulate him so that he could take over Texcoco, being that he was his uncle. Coanacochtli responded that the decision was legitimate and that even if Cacamatzin was not elected Ixtlilxochitl would not have been elected either, as he was younger than the two. Cacamatzin stayed quiet during the whole debate. Eventually, the members of the council shut down the debate to prevent a violent escalation. Though Cacamatzin was officially declared &quot;tlatoani&quot;, the coronation ceremony didn&#x27;t occur that day, and Ixtlilxochitl used this as an opportunity to plan his rebellion against him.

====Ixtlilxóchitl&#x27;s rebellion====
Shortly after the election, Ixtlilxochitl began to prepare his revolt by going to Metztitlán to raise an army, threatening civil war. Cacamatzin went to Tenochtitlan to ask Moctezuma for help. Moctezuma, understanding Ixtlilxochitl&#x27;s war-like nature, decided to support Cacamatzin with his military forces should a conflict begin and try to talk Ixtlilxochitl into stopping the conflict, and also suggested taking Nezahualpilli&#x27;s treasure to Tenochtitlan to prevent a sacking. According to Alva Ixtlilxóchitl, Cacamatzin asked Moctezuma for help after Ixtlilxochitl went to Metztitlán, while other sources claim that Ixtlilxochitl went to Metztitlán because of Cacamatzin&#x27;s visit to Moctezuma.

Ixtlilxochitl first went to Tulancingo with 100,000 men, where he was received with many honors and recognized as the real king of Texcoco. He then accelerated his pace, possibly because he received worrying news from Texcoco, and advanced to the city of Tepeapulco, where he was also welcomed. He soon advanced to Otompan (today known as Otumba, State of Mexico), where he sent a message before his entrance in hopes of being received as a king there as well. However, the people of Otumba supported Cacamatzin and informed Ixtlilxochitl that such a demand would not be fulfilled. Ixtlilxochitl therefore sent his troops to invade the city, and after a long fight the troops began to gradually retreat and its ruler was killed. When the news of this fight was heard in Texcoco, all events, religious or not, were canceled, soldiers were recruited, troops were sent from Tenochtitlan to the city and Cacamatzin and Coanacochtli fortified the city to avoid an invasion.

He eventually reached Texcoco and placed the city under siege, while also occupying the cities of Papalotlan, Acolman, Chicuhnautlan (today known as ), Tecacman, Tzonpanco (Zumpango), and Huehuetocan to take every possible entrance Moctezuma could use to send his troops to Texcoco. Moctezuma, however, used his influence to enter the city of Texcoco and obtain access to the Acolhua cities not yet occupied by Ixtlilxochitl. Cacamatzin used this opportunity to send a commander from Iztapalapa named Xochitl to arrest Ixtlilxochitl as peacefully as possible. Moctezuma approved this decision and Xochitl was sent along with some troops. Ixtlilxochitl was quickly informed about this and, as per the custom of war, informed Xochitl that he was going to fight him. A short battle occurred some time after in which Xochitl was captured and later publicly executed by burning. Once the news of this defeat was heard by Moctezuma, he ordered that no more military engagements be done for the moment to prevent further escalation and that he wanted to rightfully punish Ixtlilxochitl for what he did at a more appropriate moment. In the meantime, the brothers agreed to try to reach a consensus through a peaceful debate, as Ixtlilxochitl did not want to fight either, as he claimed that he only sent the troops as a means of protest and not to wage war. However, this would only be done under the condition that Moctezuma would not get involved by any means. The three brothers then agreed to divide the province of Acolhuacan (where Texcoco was the &quot;de facto&quot; capital) in three parts, one for each brother, and that Cacamatzin would continue to rule over Texcoco.

At some point, however, Ixtlilxochitl sought refuge outside of Texcoco to avoid facing a conflict with Cacamatzin.

===Spanish involvement===

This crisis would later become relevant again after the Spanish arrived at Tenochtitlan, when Cacamatzin, who initially welcomed the Spaniards when they first entered in November 1519, attempted to raise an army against them for imprisoning Moctezuma (&quot;see below&quot;) by calling for the people of Coyoacan, Tlacopan, Iztapalapa and the Matlatzinca people to enter the city, kill the Spaniards and free Moctezuma in early 1520. The Spanish captain Hernán Cortés, who was the main commander of the Spanish troops who entered Mexico, decided to act and ordered Moctezuma to send someone to arrest Cacamatzin before the attack. Moctezuma suggested that Ixtlilxochitl be sent due to the crisis, as then he could take the throne and prevent another succession crisis. He still tried to establish negotiations between the Texcoco leadership and the Spaniards but was unable to change Cacamatzin&#x27;s mind. Eventually, Moctezuma sent troops to secretly arrest Cacamatzin in his palace and send him to Mexico after he ordered for three of his commanders to be arrested for suggesting requesting Mocetzuma&#x27;s permission for the attack and telling him that there was no chance of entering into negotiations with the Spaniards. Ixtlilxochitl became the likely &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Texcoco afterwards, though according to Bernardino de Sahagún, it was Tecocoltzin who officially took the title of &quot;tlatoani&quot; after Cacamatzin&#x27;s arrest and Ixtlilxochitl would not officially become the &quot;tlatoani&quot; until a year later.
Ixtlilxochitl continued fighting for the Spaniards afterwards, became a personal friend of Cortés, converted to Christianity and participated in the Spanish conquest of Honduras in 1525. His figure has remained controversial in the historical record, as some have seen him as a man who betrayed his people for his ambition, while others have seen him as a brave warrior who fought against the tyrannical rule of Moctezuma II and liberated the peoples he subjugated with the help of Hernán Cortés.

==War with Tlaxcala, Huejotzingo and their allies==
Though the first conflicts between Mexico and Tlaxcala, Huejotzingo, and their allies began during the rule of Moctezuma I in the 1450s, it was during the reign of Moctezuma II that major conflicts broke through.

===Battle of Atlixco===
====Planning and preparations====
Approximately in the year 1503 (or 1507, after the conquest of Tototepec, according to historian Diego Durán), a massive battle occurred in Atlixco which was fought mainly against Huejotzingo, a kingdom that used to be one of the most powerful ones in the Valley of Mexico. The war was provoked by Moctezuma himself, who wanted to go to war against Huejotzingo because it had been many months since the last war. The local rulers of the region accepted Moctezuma&#x27;s proposal to wage this war. It was declared as a flower war, and the invitation to go to war was accepted by the people of Huejotzingo, Tlaxcala, Cholula, and Tliliuhquitepec, a city-state nearby. The war was arranged to occur in the plains of Atlixco. Moctezuma went to the fight along with four or five of his brothers and two of his nephews.

He named one of his brothers (or children, according to some sources), Tlacahuepan, as the main commander of the troops against the troops of Huejotzingo. He was assigned 100,000 troops to fight. Tlacahuepan decided to begin the fight by dividing the troops into three groups which would attack one after the other, the first being the troops from Texcoco, then from Tlacopan, and lastly from Tenochtitlan.

====Battle====
He began by sending 200 troops to launch skirmishes against the Huexotzinca, but despite the large numbers and skirmishes, he was unable to break the enemy lines. The group of Texcoco suffered huge losses and once they were unable to fight they were put to rest while the group from Tlacopan was sent. However, they were still unable to break the lines. The Tenochca group then advanced and pushed to aid the Tepanecs of Tlacopan, causing multiple casualties against the Huexotzinca, but the lines were still not broken as more reinforcements arrived. Eventually, Tlacahuepan saw himself surrounded, and though he initially resisted, he finally surrendered. Though the Huexotzinca wanted to take him alive, he asked to be sacrificed there on the battlefield, and so he was killed, and then the rest of the Mexica troops retreated. The result of this battle was considered humiliating for the empire. According to primary records, about 40,000 people were killed on both sides (possibly meaning that about 20,000 died on each side). Some important Mexica noblemen were also killed during the engagement, including Huitzilihuitzin (not to be confused with the &quot;tlatoani&quot; of this name), Xalmich and Cuatacihuatl.

====Aftermath====
Regardless, multiple prisoners were taken after the fight, who were later sacrificed in Moctezuma&#x27;s honor. Tlacahuepan was remembered as a hero despite the loss, and many songs were dedicated to him to be remembered through poetry. In one song called &quot;Ycuic neçahualpilli yc tlamato huexotzinco. Cuextecayotl, Quitlali cuicani Tececepouhqui&quot; (&quot;The song of Nezahualpilli when he took captives in Huexotzinco. [It tells of] the Huastec themes, it was written down by the singer Tececepouhqui&quot;), he&#x27;s referred as &quot;the golden one, the Huastec lord, the owner of the sapota skirt&quot;, about the god Xipe Totec, and also states &quot;With the flowery liquor of war, he is drunk, my nobleman, the golden one, the Huastec Lord&quot;, about his Huastec heritage, using the stereotype that the Huastecs were drunkards. Anyway, the defeat was a humiliating one, and Moctezuma is said to have cried in anguish upon hearing of the death of Tlacahuepan and the massive loss of soldiers. Moctezuma himself welcomed the soldiers who survived back into Mexico, while the population that welcomed them mourned.

The fact that the Huexotzinca also suffered massive casualties caused their military power to be highly weakened by this battle and various others, and so this could be seen as the beginning of the fall of Huejotzingo, as multiple military losses against Tlaxcala and Mexico in the following years eventually led to its fall, despite the victory in the fight.

===Other battles against Huejotzingo and its allies===
Various other battles occurred in the following years between Mexico and Huejotzingo, and though none of them were as big as the Battle of Atlixco, they still caused significant losses on both sides; high losses for Mexico and significant losses for Huejotzingo.

An engagement which occurred likely in the year of 1506. This fight was another flower war which was proposed by Cholula, with support from Huejotzingo, to be fought in Cuauhquechollan (today known as Huaquechula, in modern-day Puebla), near Atlixco. Though Moctezuma did not want to fight as a result of the previous defeat in Atlixco, he saw no other option and prepared for the fight. In this fight, warriors from Texcoco, Tlacopan, Chalco, Xochimilco, and modern-day Tierra Caliente participated. This battle reportedly ended with 8200 Mexicas killed or captured. However, the Mexica are said to have dealt a similar number of casualties in this one-day battle. The result of this battle was indecisive, as some reported it as a victory, but it seems Moctezuma II took it as a defeat and was highly upset about it, to the point that he complained against the gods.

Fernando Alvarado Tezozómoc, however, reports that 10,000 Mexicas died in this fight and that the Mexica were so angry about the fight that they called for reinforcements who committed a &quot;cruel slaughter&quot; and captured 800 more enemies. He lists the number of Huexotzinco-Cholula casualties as 5600 killed and 400 captured in one other engagement afterwards, which resulted in 8200 Mexicas killed or captured.

===Invasion of Tlaxcala===
====Initial stages====
It was approximately in the year 1504 or 1505 when the first large-scale conflicts between Mexico and Tlaxcala began. In this period, Moctezuma thought about placing the entire country under siege, understanding that most of it was surrounded by territories belonging to the empire. The ruler of Huejotzingo, Tecayahuatzin, sympathized with Moctezuma despite their connections with Tlaxcala and conflicts in the past, and through bribes and propaganda attempted to ally with Cholula and local Otomi populations to attack Tlaxcala, though with little success. The Tlaxcalans became greatly worried about this and began to grow suspicious of all allies they had fearing a betrayal, as Huejotzingo was one of Tlaxcala&#x27;s closest states, as proven by its support at the battle of Atlixco. Moctezuma, however, had the disadvantage that many of his dominions surrounding Tlaxcala did not want to fight them, as many of them used to be their allies in the past even with all the promises Moctezuma made, and therefore his support was actually quite limited.

One of the first battles occurred in Xiloxochitlan (today known as ), where multiple atrocities were committed. Despite this, the Tlaxcalan resistance managed to hold out, and after a great struggle, the Huexotzinca armies were repelled, though during the fight the Ocotelolca commander Tizatlacatzin was killed. Many other smaller battles took place in other parts of the border, though none of them were successful.
In response, Tlaxcala launched a counter-invasion against Huejotzingo, knowing that the Huexotzinca had been severely weakened by their fights with the Mexica Empire; their towns were sacked repeatedly and the entire nation was put essentially under siege, and the remains of the nation were now cornered in the region around the Popocatépetl. The Huexotzinca became greatly worried and knew they couldn&#x27;t win the war alone, therefore a prince named Teayehuatl decided to send an embassy to Mexico to request aid against the Tlaxcalans. According to historians like Durán, this embassy was sent in the year 1507, just after the New Fire Ceremony, while others date this embassy to the year 1512. The embassy informed Moctezuma about the Tlaxcalan counter-invasion, which had been happening for over a year by this point, requesting Moctezuma to do something about the situation to expel the Tlaxcalans from their land. This was not the first time the Huexotzinca had requested aid from Mexico for similar reasons, as the first time was actually around the year 1499, during the reign of Ahuizotl, though this previous request was denied. After consulting Nezahualpilli and the ruler of Tlacopan, Moctezuma agreed to help the Huexotzinca, despite the conflicts they had in the past, and sent a large number of soldiers to help this nation, while also allowing many of their refugees to stay in Tenochtitlan and Chalco.

====Late stages====
With the Mexica forces to support Huejotzingo, the invasion continued from the west with the main force from the towns of Cuauhquechollan, Tochimilco, Itzocan (today known as Izúcar de Matamoros), and a smaller support force from a town named Tetellan (today, Tetela de Ocampo) and from a town named Chietla. The advance was quick, but the Tlaxcalans used the territories they had captured from Huejotzingo to advance safely to Atlixco through the captured areas with little population before the Mexica-Huejotzingo forces spread. Once done, a long fight began between the two forces. The battle lasted 20 days, and both armies suffered huge losses, as the Tlaxcalans had a famous general captured and the Mexica lost so many men that they requested emergency reinforcements, asking for &quot;all kinds of people in the shortest possible time&quot;. The Tlaxcalans claimed victory in that fight, and the Mexica were fought into a complete standstill. The following year, Huejotzingo started to suffer a famine as the result of a lack of resources as the Tlaxcalans pushed further into their territory. The Tlaxcalans even went as far as burning down the royal palaces of Huejotzingo and stealing as much food as they could.

Approximately in the year 1516, Huejotzingo abandoned its alliance with the empire.

The devastating wars that broke out against Huejotzingo caused this nation, which had been the most powerful nation in the Valley of Puebla in the opening years of the 16th century, to become weak enough to be conquered by Tlaxcala. This was the point at which Tlaxcala became Mexico&#x27;s most powerful rival in the central Mexican area. The nation which used to be their main military focus was now the subject of a nation that would later bring the killing blow to the Mexica Empire.

The war between Mexico and Tlaxcala would eventually have devastating consequences, as the Tlaxcalans decided an alliance with Spain against Mexico on 23 September 1519 after a few battles proved that an alliance with this nation could help them destroy Moctezuma&#x27;s reign.

==Contact with the Spanish ==
===First interactions with the Spanish===
In 1518, Moctezuma received the first reports of Europeans landing on the east coast of his empire; this was the expedition of Juan de Grijalva who had landed on San Juan de Ulúa, which although within Totonac territory was under the auspices of the Aztec Empire. Moctezuma ordered that he be kept informed of any new sightings of foreigners at the coast and posted extra watchguards and watchtowers to accomplish this.

When Cortés arrived in 1519, Moctezuma was immediately informed and he sent emissaries to meet the newcomers; one of them was an Aztec noble named Tentlil in the Nahuatl language but referred to in the writings of Cortés and Bernal Díaz del Castillo as &quot;Tendile&quot;. As the Spaniards approached Tenochtitlán they allied with the Tlaxcalteca, who were enemies of the Aztec Triple Alliance, and they helped instigate revolt in many towns under Aztec dominion. Moctezuma was aware of this and sent gifts to the Spaniards, probably to show his superiority to the Spaniards and Tlaxcalteca.

On 8 November 1519, Moctezuma met Cortés on the causeway leading into Tenochtitlán and the two leaders exchanged gifts. Moctezuma gave Cortés the gift of an Aztec calendar, one disc of crafted gold, and another of silver. Cortés later melted these down for their monetary value.

According to Cortés, Moctezuma immediately volunteered to cede his entire realm to Charles V, King of Spain. Though some indigenous accounts written in the 1550s partly support this notion, it is still unbelievable for several reasons. As Aztec rulers spoke an overly polite language that needed a translation for their subjects to understand, it was difficult to determine what Moctezuma said. According to an indigenous account, he said to Cortés: &quot;You have come to sit on your seat of authority, which I have kept for a while for you, where I have been in charge for you, for your agents the rulers ...&quot; However, these words might be a polite expression that was meant to convey the exact opposite meaning, which was common in Nahua culture; Moctezuma might have intended these words to assert his stature and multigenerational legitimacy. Also, according to Spanish law, the king had no right to demand that foreign peoples become his subjects, but he had every right to bring rebels to heel. Therefore, to give the Spanish the necessary legitimacy to wage war against the indigenous people, Cortés might just have said what the Spanish king needed to hear.

===Host and prisoner of the Spaniards===

Six days after their arrival, Moctezuma became a prisoner in his own house. Exactly why this happened is not clear from the extant sources.

According to the Spanish, the arrest was made as a result of an attack perpetrated by a tribute collector from Nautla named Qualpopoca (or Quetzalpopoca) on a Spanish Totonac garrison. The garrison was under the command of a Spanish captain named Juan de Escalante and the attack was in retaliation for the Totonac rebellion against Moctezuma which started in July 1519 after the Spanish arrived. This attack resulted in the death of many Totonacs and approximately seven Spaniards, including Escalante. Though some Spaniards described that this was the only reason for Moctezuma&#x27;s arrest, others have suspected that Escalante&#x27;s death was merely used as an excuse by Cortés to imprison Moctezuma and usurp power over Mexico, positing that Cortés might have planned to imprison Moctezuma before they even met. Cortés himself admitted that he imprisoned Moctezuma primarily to avoid losing control over Mexico, understanding that nearly all of his forces were within his domains.

Moctezuma claimed innocence for this incident, claiming that though he was aware of the attack as Quetzalpopoca brought him the severed head of a Spaniard as a demonstration of his success, he never ordered it and was highly displeased by these events.

Around 20 days after his arrest, Quetzalpopoca was captured, together with his son and 15 nobles who allegedly participated in the attack, and after a brief interrogation, he admitted that indeed Moctezuma was innocent. He was publicly executed by burning soon after, but Moctezuma remained prisoner regardless.

Despite his imprisonment, Moctezuma continued to live a somewhat comfortable life, being free to perform many of his daily activities and being respected as a monarch. Cortés himself even ordered for any soldiers who disrespected him to be physically and roughly punished regardless of rank or position. However, despite still being treated as a respected monarch, he had virtually lost most of his power as emperor as the Spaniards oversaw nearly all of his activities.

Moctezuma repeatedly protected the Spaniards against potential threats using the little power he had left, either under the threat of the Spanish or by his own will, such as during the succession crisis in Texcoco mentioned above, when he ordered for the ruler of Texcoco, Cacamatzin, to be arrested as he was planning to form an army to attack the Spaniards.

The Aztec nobility reportedly became increasingly displeased with the large Spanish army staying in Tenochtitlán, and Moctezuma told Cortés that it would be best if they left. Shortly thereafter, in April 1520, Cortés left to fight Pánfilo de Narváez, who had landed in Mexico to arrest Cortés. During his absence, tensions between Spaniards and Aztecs exploded into the Massacre in the Great Temple, and Moctezuma became a hostage used by the Spaniards to ensure their security.

===Death===

In the subsequent battles with the Spaniards after Cortés&#x27; return, Moctezuma was killed. The details of his death are unknown, with different versions of his demise given by different sources.

In his , Bernal Díaz del Castillo states that on 29 June 1520, the Spanish forced Moctezuma to appear on the balcony of his palace, appealing to his countrymen to retreat. Four leaders of the Aztec army met with Moctezuma to talk, urging their countrymen to cease their constant firing upon the stronghold for a time. Díaz states: &quot;Many of the Mexican Chieftains and Captains knew him well and at once ordered their people to be silent and not to discharge darts, stones or arrows, and four of them reached a spot where Montezuma [Moctezuma] could speak to them.&quot;

Díaz alleges that the Aztecs informed Moctezuma that a relative of his had risen to the throne and ordered their attack to continue until all of the Spanish were annihilated, but expressed remorse at Moctezuma&#x27;s captivity and stated that they intended to revere him even more if they could rescue him. Regardless of the earlier orders to hold fire, however, the discussion between Moctezuma and the Aztec leaders was immediately followed by an outbreak of violence. The Aztecs, disgusted by the actions of their leader, renounced Moctezuma and named his brother Cuitláhuac &quot;tlatoani&quot; in his place. To pacify his people, and undoubtedly pressured by the Spanish, Moctezuma spoke to a crowd but was struck dead by a rock. Díaz gives this account:

Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún oversaw the recording of two versions of the conquest of the Aztec Empire from the Tenochtitlán-Tlatelolco viewpoint. Book 12 of the Florentine Codex, which indigenous scholars composed under Sahagún&#x27;s tutelage, is an illustrative, Spanish and Nahuatl account of the Conquest which attributes Moctezuma II&#x27;s death to Spanish conquistadors. According to the Codex, the bodies of Moctezuma and Itzquauhtzin were cast out of the Palace by the Spanish; the body of Moctezuma was gathered up and cremated at Copulco.

&quot;History of the Indies of New Spain&quot; by Dominican friar Diego Durán references both Spanish and indigenous accounts of Moctezuma II&#x27;s death. Durán notes that Spanish historians and the former conquistador he interviewed recall Moctezuma dying to Aztec projectiles. However, his indigenous text and a historical informant claimed that Cortés&#x27; forces stabbed Moctezuma to death. In other indigenous annals, the Aztecs found Moctezuma strangled to death in his palace.

===Aftermath===
The Spaniards were forced to flee the city and they took refuge in Tlaxcala and signed a treaty with the natives there to conquer Tenochtitlán, offering the Tlaxcalans control of Tenochtitlán and freedom from any kind of tribute.

Moctezuma was then succeeded by his brother Cuitláhuac, who died shortly afterwards during a smallpox epidemic. He was succeeded by his adolescent nephew, Cuauhtémoc. During the siege of the city, the sons of Moctezuma were murdered by the Aztecs, possibly because they wanted to surrender. By the following year, the Aztec Empire had fallen to an army of Spanish and their Native American allies, primarily Tlaxcalans, who were traditional enemies of the Aztecs.

==Contemporary depictions==
===Bernal Díaz del Castillo===
The firsthand account of Bernal Díaz del Castillo&#x27;s &quot;True History of the Conquest of New Spain&quot; paints a portrait of a noble leader who struggles to maintain order in his kingdom after he is taken prisoner by Hernán Cortés. In his first description of Moctezuma, Díaz del Castillo writes:

When Moctezuma was allegedly killed by being stoned to death by his people, &quot;Cortés and all of us captains and soldiers wept for him, and there was no one among us that knew him and had dealings with him who did not mourn him as if he were our father, which was not surprising since he was so good. It was stated that he had reigned for seventeen years, and was the best king they ever had in Mexico, and that he had personally triumphed in three wars against countries he had subjugated. I have spoken of the sorrow we all felt when we saw that Montezuma was dead. We even blamed the Mercedarian friar for not having persuaded him to become a Christian.&quot;

===Hernán Cortés===
Unlike Bernal Díaz, who was recording his memories many years after the fact, Cortés wrote his (&quot;Letters from Mexico&quot;) to justify his actions to the Spanish Crown. His prose is characterized by simple descriptions and explanations, along with frequent personal addresses to the King. In his Second Letter, Cortés describes his first encounter with Moctezuma thus:

Anthony Pagden and Eulalia Guzmán have pointed out the Biblical messages that Cortés seems to ascribe to Moctezuma&#x27;s retelling of the legend of Quetzalcoatl as a vengeful Messiah who would return to rule over the Mexica. Pagden has written that &quot;There is no preconquest tradition which places Quetzalcoatl in this role, and it seems possible therefore that it was elaborated by Sahagún and Motolinía from informants who themselves had partially lost contact with their traditional tribal histories&quot;.

===Bernardino de Sahagún===
The Florentine Codex, made by Bernardino de Sahagún and indigenous scholars under his tutelage, relied on native informants from Tlatelolco and generally portrays Tlatelolco and Tlatelolcan rulers in a favorable light relative to those of Tenochtitlan. Historian Matthew Restall claims that the Codex depicts Moctezuma as weak-willed, superstitious, and indulgent. James Lockhart suggests that Moctezuma fills the role of a scapegoat for the Aztec defeat.

Other historians have noted that the Codex may not necessarily cast Moctezuma as cowardly and responsible for Spanish colonization. Rebecca Dufendach argues that the Codex reflects the native informants&#x27; uniquely indigenous manner of portraying leaders who suffered from poor health brought on by fright.

===Fernando Alvarado Tezozómoc===
Fernando Alvarado Tezozómoc, who may have written the , was possibly a grandson of Moctezuma II. His chronicle may relate mostly to the genealogy of the Aztec rulers. He described Moctezuma&#x27;s issue and estimated them to be nineteen – eleven sons and eight daughters.

==Depiction in early post-conquest literature==
Some of the Aztec stories about Moctezuma describe him as being fearful of the Spanish newcomers, and some sources, such as the Florentine Codex, comment that the Aztecs believed the Spaniards to be gods and Cortés to be the returned god Quetzalcoatl. The veracity of this claim is difficult to ascertain, though some recent ethnohistorians specializing in early Spanish/Nahua relations have discarded it as post-conquest mythicalization.

Much of the idea of Cortés being seen as a deity can be traced back to the Florentine Codex, written some 50 years after the conquest. In the codex&#x27;s description of the first meeting between Moctezuma and Cortés, the Aztec ruler is described as giving a prepared speech in classical oratorical Nahuatl, a speech which as described verbatim in the codex (written by Sahagún&#x27;s Tlatelolcan informants) included such prostrate declarations of divine or near-divine admiration as &quot;You have graciously come on earth, you have graciously approached your water, your high place of Mexico, you have come down to your mat, your throne, which I have briefly kept for you, I who used to keep it for you&quot;, and, &quot;You have graciously arrived, you have known pain, you have known weariness, now come on earth, take your rest, enter into your palace, rest your limbs; may our lords come on earth.&quot; While some historians such as Warren H. Carroll consider this as evidence that Moctezuma was at least open to the possibility that the Spaniards were divinely sent based on the Quetzalcoatl legend, others such as Matthew Restall argue that Moctezuma politely offered his throne to Cortés (if indeed he did ever give the speech as reported) may well have been meant as the exact opposite of what it was taken to mean, as politeness in Aztec culture was a way to assert dominance and show superiority. Other parties have also propagated the idea that the Native Americans believed the conquistadors to be gods, most notably the historians of the Franciscan order such as Fray Gerónimo de Mendieta. Bernardino de Sahagún, who compiled the Florentine Codex, was also a Franciscan priest.

===Indigenous accounts of omens and Moctezuma&#x27;s beliefs===

Bernardino de Sahagún (1499–1590) includes in Book 12 of the Florentine Codex eight events said to have occurred before the arrival of the Spanish. These were purportedly interpreted as signs of a possible disaster, e.g. a comet, the burning of a temple, a crying ghostly woman, and others. Some speculate that the Aztecs were particularly susceptible to such ideas of doom and disaster because the particular year in which the Spanish arrived coincided with a &quot;tying of years&quot; ceremony at the end of a 52-year cycle in the Aztec calendar, which in Aztec belief was linked to changes, rebirth, and dangerous events. The belief of the Aztecs being rendered passive by their superstition is referred to by Matthew Restall as part of &quot;The Myth of Native Desolation&quot; to which he dedicates chapter 6 in his book &quot;Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest&quot;. These legends are likely a part of the post-conquest rationalization by the Aztecs of their defeat, and serve to show Moctezuma as indecisive, vain, and superstitious, and ultimately the cause of the fall of the Aztec Empire.
According to 16th-century Spanish historian Diego Durán, who was one of the most important chroniclers of the indigenous stories of the empire, Nezahualpilli was among those who informed Moctezuma of the imminent destruction of the empire by a foreign invader, warning him that omens confirming his fears will soon appear. This warning caused Moctezuma great fear and he made a series of erratic decisions immediately after, such as severe punishments against his soldiers for disappointing results after battles against the Tlaxcalans.
Ethnohistorian Susan Gillespie has argued that the Nahua understanding of history as repeating itself in cycles also led to a subsequent rationalization of the events of the conquests. In this interpretation, the description of Moctezuma, the final ruler of the Aztec Empire before the Spanish conquest, was tailored to fit the role of earlier rulers of ending dynasties—for example, Quetzalcoatl, the mythical last ruler of the Toltecs. In any case it is within the realm of possibility that the description of Moctezuma in post-conquest sources was coloured by his role as a monumental closing figure of Aztec history.

==Personal life==
===Wives, concubines, and children===
Moctezuma had numerous wives and concubines by whom he fathered an enormous family, but only two women held the position of queen – Tlapalizquixochtzin and Teotlalco. His partnership with Tlapalizquixochtzin, daughter of Matlaccoatzin of Ecatepec, also made him king consort of Ecatepec since she was queen of that city. However, Spanish accounts describe that very few people in Mexico knew that these two women held such positions of power, some of those who knew being a few of his close servants.
Of his many wives may be named the princesses Teitlalco, Acatlan, and Miahuaxochitl, of whom the first named appears to have been the only legitimate consort. By her, he left a son, Chimalpopoca, who fell during the Noche Triste, and a daughter, Tecuichpoch, later baptized as Isabel Moctezuma. By the Princess Acatlan were left two daughters, baptized as Maria and Mariana (also known as Leonor); the latter alone left offspring, from whom descends the Sotelo-Montezuma family.

Though the exact number of his children is unknown and the names of most of them have been lost to history, according to a Spanish chronicler, by the time he was taken captive, Moctezuma had fathered 100 children and fifty of his wives and concubines were then in some stage of pregnancy, though this estimate may have been exaggerated. As Aztec culture made class distinctions between the children of senior wives, lesser wives, and concubines, not all of his children were considered equal in nobility or inheritance rights. Among his many children were Princess Isabel Moctezuma, Princess Mariana Leonor Moctezuma, and sons Chimalpopoca (not to be confused with the previous &quot;huey tlatoani&quot;) and Tlaltecatzin. Noteworthy is also Francisca de Moctezuma, his daughter by Tlapalizquixochtzin, Queen-regant of Ecatepec. She married Don Diego de Alvarado Huanitzin, the first governor of Mexico City.

===Activities===
Moctezuma was physically fit and practised a variety of sports, among them archery and swimming. He was well-trained in the arts of war, as he was experienced on the battlefield from an early age.

Among the sports he practised, he was an active hunter, and often used to hunt for deer, rabbits, and various birds in a certain section of a forest (likely the Bosque de Chapultepec) that was exclusive to him and whomever he invited. It was prohibited for anyone without permission to enter, and allegedly any trespassers would be put to death. He also used to invite servants to this forest, should he order for certain animals to be hunted for him, which would often be done for the entertainment of his guests.

Moctezuma was recorded to have been heavily obsessed with cleanliness and personal hygiene, such as bathing multiple times a day in his private pool; as well as not wearing the same clothes every day.

A Spanish soldier accompanying Hernan Cortés during the conquest of the Aztec Empire reported that when Moctezuma II dined, he took no other beverage than chocolate, served in a golden goblet. Moctezuma was passionate about chocolate; he had it flavoured with vanilla or other spices such as chili peppers, and his chocolate was whipped into a froth that dissolved in the mouth. No fewer than 60 portions each day reportedly may have been consumed by Moctezuma II, and 2,000 more by the nobles of his court.

==Legacy==
===Descendants in Mexico and the Spanish nobility===

Several lines of descendants exist in Mexico and Spain through Moctezuma II&#x27;s son and daughters, notably Tlacahuepan Ihualicahuaca, or Pedro Moctezuma, and Tecuichpoch Ixcaxochitzin, or Isabel Moctezuma. Following the conquest, Moctezuma&#x27;s daughter, Techichpotzin (or Tecuichpoch), became known as Isabel Moctezuma and was given a large estate by Cortés, who also fathered a child by her, Leonor Cortés Moctezuma, who in turn was the mother of Isabel de Tolosa Cortés de Moctezuma. Isabel married consecutively to Cuauhtémoc (the last Mexican sovereign), to a conquistador in Cortés&#x27; original group, Alonso Grado (died c. 1527), a &quot;poblador&quot; (a Spaniard who had arrived after the fall of Tenochtitlán), to Pedro Andrade Gallego (died c. 1531), and to conquistador Juan Cano de Saavedra, who survived her. She had children by the latter two, from whom descend the illustrious families of Andrade-Montezuma and Cano-Montezuma. A nephew of Moctezuma II was Diego de Alvarado Huanitzin.

A further line of descendants originates with Doña Francisca Moctezuma, the daughter of Moctezuma II. and Tlapalizquixochtzin, the Queen regnant of Ecatepec. Her grandson Don Pedro Cortés Tetlepanquetzatzin de Tlacopan - his grandfather and husband of Doña Francisca Moctezuma being Don Diego de Alvarado Huanitzin, King of Ecatepec and High-King of Tenochtitlan, later on its first governor under Spanish rule - married Ana de Chilapa, a direct descendant from the rulers of Chilapa, Coyoacán, Xochimilco, Texcoco and also the High-King Axayácatl. Her great-grandson Don Joseph Tesifón Moctezuma, Cacique de Chilapa, married a daughter of Don Antonio de Ordaz Villagómez, the second encomendero of Chilapa, who in turn descended from the House of Ponce de León. The offspring from this marriage thus claim descent not only from several Mexica royal houses but also the Kings of Leon and Castilla. Agustín Moctezuma, the grandson of Joseph Tesifón Moctezuma de Chilapa, married María Antonia Guerrero Dávila, a member of the Guerrero-Dávila family. The founders of this family Juan Guerrero de Luna and Beatriz Gómez Dávila were offspring of &quot;conquistadores&quot; and together with their children have established several mayorazgos in Mexico incorporating also the inheritance of Alonso “El Rico” de Villaseca, one of the largest fortunes at that time. Their main seat were the Houses of the Mayorazgo de Guerrero in Mexico City. Thus, the Cacicazgo of Chilapa, held by old Mexica royalty, and one of the 16th century Mayorazgos of the Spanish nobility in New Spain, were merged within the House of Guerrero-Dávila-Moctezuma. Today, descendants of this branch can be found in Chilapa and Mexico City, the latter (for example the families Sandoval-Alvear and Mariscal-Alvear) being mostly descendants of Roque de Alvear y Herrera and Maria de la Luz Guerrero Dávila Moctezuma. These two played a prominent role in an infamous trial concerning the control over the Mayorazgo Guerrero-Dávila in 1775–1777.
The grandson of Moctezuma II, Pedro&#x27;s son, Ihuitemotzin, baptized as Diego Luis de Moctezuma, was brought to Spain by King Philip II. There he married Francisca de la Cueva de Valenzuela. In 1627, their son Pedro Tesifón de Moctezuma was given the title &quot;Count of Moctezuma&quot; (later altered to &quot;Moctezuma de Tultengo&quot;) and thus became part of the Spanish nobility. In 1766, the holder of the title became a Grandee of Spain. In 1865 (coincidentally during the Second Mexican Empire), the title, which was held by Antonio María Moctezuma-Marcilla de Teruel y Navarro, 14th Count of Moctezuma de Tultengo, was elevated to that of a duke, thus becoming &quot;Duke of Moctezuma&quot;, with &quot;de Tultengo&quot; again added in 1992 by Juan Carlos I.

Descendants of Pedro Tesifón de Moctezuma included (through an illegitimate child of his son Diego Luis) General Jerónimo Girón-Moctezuma, 3rd Marquis de las Amarillas (1741–1819), a ninth-generation descendant of Moctezuma II, who was commander of the Spanish forces at the Battle of Fort Charlotte, and his grandson, Francisco Javier Girón y Ezpeleta, 2nd Duke of Ahumada and 5th Marquess of the Amarillas who was the founder of the Guardia Civil in Spain. Other holders of Spanish noble titles that descend from the Aztec emperor include Dukes of Atrisco. Researchers believe an additional line of descent exists in Mexico through Ana Francisca de Gabadi y Moctezuma, the wife of Basque nobleman, and early colonist and settler in Mexico, Don Lope Ruiz de Esparza. This Ana Francisca de Gabadi y Moctezuma was the daughter of Martín Navarro and Petronila de Moctezuma, believed by some experts to be a direct lineal descendant of Moctezuma II (documental evidence has not been found yet to support this).

Notable descendants from this line include Mexican politicians and philanthropists, Secretary Gerardo Ruiz de Esparza and Luis Rubén (né Valadez Bourbon) of the influential Macias-Valadez in the state of Jalisco, Mexico. According to family historian Blanca Barragan Moctezuma, there are between 600 and 700 living descendants of Emperor Moctezuma in Mexico and 350 living in Spain as of 2020. Another notable descendant is Estaban Moctezuma, who served as Secretary of Public Education of the Government of Mexico.

===Indigenous mythology and folklore===
Many indigenous peoples in Mexico are reported to worship deities named after the Aztec ruler, and often a part of the myth is that someday the deified Moctezuma shall return to vindicate his people. In Mexico, the contemporary Pames, Otomi, Tepehuán, Totonac, and Nahua peoples are reported to worship earth deities named after Moctezuma. His name also appears in Tzotzil Maya ritual in Zinacantán where dancers dressed as a rain god are called &quot;Moctezumas&quot;.

Hubert Howe Bancroft, writing in the 19th century (&quot;Native Races&quot;, Volume 3), speculated that the name of the historical Aztec emperor Moctezuma had been used to refer to a combination of different cultural heroes who were united under the name of a particular salient representative of Mesoamerican identity.

===Symbol of indigenous leadership===
As a symbol of resistance against the Spanish, the name of Moctezuma has been invoked in several indigenous rebellions. One such example was the rebellion of the Virgin Cult in Chiapas in 1721, where the followers of the Virgin Mary rebelled against the Spanish after having been told by an apparition of the virgin that Moctezuma would be resuscitated to assist them against their Spanish oppressors. In the Quisteil rebellion of the Yucatec Maya in 1761, the rebel leader Jacinto Canek reportedly called himself &quot;Little Montezuma&quot;.

==Portrayals and cultural references==
===Art, music, and literature===
The Aztec emperor is the title character in several 18th-century operas: &quot;Motezuma&quot; (1733) by Antonio Vivaldi; &quot;Motezuma&quot; (1771) by Josef Mysliveček; &quot;Montezuma&quot; (1755) by Carl Heinrich Graun; and &quot;Montesuma&quot; (1781) by Niccolò Antonio Zingarelli. He is also the subject of Roger Sessions&#x27; dodecaphonic opera &quot;Montezuma&quot; (1963), and the protagonist in the modern opera (2005) by Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero, where his part is written in the Nahuatl language.

Numerous other works of popular culture have mentioned or referred to Moctezuma:
*Moctezuma (spelled Montezuma) is portrayed in Lew Wallace&#x27;s first novel &quot;The Fair God&quot; (1873). He is portrayed as influenced by the belief that Cortés was Quetzalcoatl returned, and as a weak and indecisive leader, saving the conquistadores from certain defeat in one battle by ordering the Aztecs to stop.
*The Marines&#x27; Hymn&#x27;s opening line &quot;From the Halls of Montezuma&quot; refers to the Battle of Chapultepec in Mexico City during the Mexican–American War, 1846–1848.
*Montezuma is mentioned in Neil Young&#x27;s song &quot;Cortez the Killer&quot;, from the 1975 album &quot;Zuma&quot; (the title of which is also believed to derive from &quot;Montezuma&quot;). The song&#x27;s lyrics paint a heavily romanticized portrait of Montezuma and his empire.
*On the facade of the Royal Palace of Madrid, there is a statue of the emperor Moctezuma II, along with another of the Inca emperor Atahualpa, among the statues of the kings of the ancient kingdoms that formed Spain.
*In the alternate history of Randall Garrett&#x27;s &quot;Lord Darcy&quot; stories, where the Aztecs were conquered by an Anglo-French Empire rather than by Spain, Moctezuma II was converted to Christianity and retained his rule of Mexico as a vassal of the London-based king, and Moctezuma&#x27;s descendants were still ruling in this capacity in the equivalent of the 20th century.
*&quot;Montezuma&quot; is a song from the album &quot;Holiday in Paradise&quot; (1981) by the German band Goombay Dance Band.
*The video game &quot;Age of Empires II: The Conquerors&quot; contains a six-chapter campaign titled &quot;Montezuma&quot;.
*Álvaro Enrigue&#x27;s novel &quot;You Dreamed of Empires&quot;, depicts the initial meetings between Moctezuma and Hernán Cortés and features Moctezuma as its principal character.

===Other references===
*Moctezuma River and Mount Moctezuma, a volcano in Mexico City, are named after him.
*Montezuma Falls in Tasmania is named after him.
*Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma Brewery, a brewery of Heineken International in Monterrey, Mexico, is named after Moctezuma II and his nephew, Cuauhtémoc.
*Montezuma Castle and Montezuma Well, 13th-century Sinagua dwellings in central Arizona, were named by 19th-century American pioneers who mistakenly thought they were built by the Aztecs.
*Several species of animals and plants such as Montezuma quail, Montezuma oropendola, &quot;Argyrotaenia montezumae&quot;, and &quot;Pinus montezumae&quot; have been named after him.
*An elementary school in Albuquerque, New Mexico is named Montezuma Elementary School, after him.
*&quot;Montezuma&#x27;s Revenge&quot; is a colloquialism for traveler&#x27;s diarrhea in visitors to Mexico. The urban legend states that Montezuma II initiated the onslaught of diarrhea on &quot;gringo&quot; travelers to Mexico in retribution for the slaughter and subsequent enslavement of the Aztec people by Hernán Cortés in 1521.
*Montezuma, Costa Rica is named after him
*Montezuma, Iowa is named after him

<text>Mickey Hart (born Michael Steven Hartman, September 11, 1943) is an American percussionist. He is best known as one of the two drummers of the rock band Grateful Dead. He was a member of the Grateful Dead from September 1967 until February 1971, and again from October 1974 until their final show in July 1995. He and fellow Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann earned the nickname &quot;the rhythm devils&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Michael Steven Hartman was born in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, New York. He was raised in the nearby suburban community of Inwood, New York by his mother, Leah, a drummer, gown maker and bookkeeper. His father Lenny Hart, a champion rudimental drummer, had abandoned his family when the younger Hart was a toddler. Although Hart (who was hyperactive and not academically inclined) became interested in percussion as a grade school student, his interest intensified after seeing his father&#x27;s picture in a newsreel documenting the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair. Shortly thereafter, he discovered a practice pad and a pair of snakewood sticks that belonged to his father. &quot;From the age of ten,&quot; he recalled, &quot;all I did was drum.&quot;

He attended Lawrence High School in Cedarhurst, New York. Hart would later recall that many champion rudimental drummers attended his high school; this inspired him to ascend to the first chair in the All State Band as a pupil of Arthur Jones, who served as a father figure to him and ensured that he was not suspended for neglecting his other classes.

While employed as a soda jerk at El Patio, a jazz club in Atlantic Beach, New York, he was influenced by Tito Puente&#x27;s regular appearances. A few months out of high school, he discovered the work of Nigerian drummer Babatunde Olatunji, another formative influence. Olatunji later taught and collaborated with Hart.

Hart dropped out of high school as a senior. Impressed by its musical pedigree, he enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1961. He served as a drummer in The Airmen of Note, an elite big band unit in the United States Air Force Band modeled after Glenn Miller&#x27;s celebrated Army Air Forces Band.

For three and a half years, he was stationed throughout Europe, where he also claimed to have taught &quot;combative measures&quot; (most notably judo, in which he had attained a black belt) to units of the Strategic Air Command and other units in Europe and Africa. During a tour in Spain, he reportedly sat in with a variety of notable jazz musicians (including Gerry Mulligan and Count Basie) in addition to performing in various ensembles (spanning the gamut from small jazz combos to marching bands) and on recording sessions for local pop stars. Hart would later intimate in a 1972 interview that his Airmen of Note assignment served as a &quot;cover&quot; for his instructive duties. While in the Air Force, he co-founded Joe and the Jaguars (alternatively billed as The Jaguars) with a fellow serviceman, guitarist Joe Bennett. Following his 1965 discharge, Hart briefly returned to the New York metropolitan area, where he filled in for the regular drummer in a &quot;staid fox-trot band&quot; as a member of the local musician&#x27;s union.

While stationed in southern California, he had discovered that his father (by now employed as a savings and loan association executive in Los Angeles) was still involved in the drumming community as an endorser for Remo. Founder Remo Belli facilitated an introduction before Hart was reassigned to Spain, but the elder Hart soon disappeared. A post-discharge reconciliation attempt (also mediated by Belli) proved to be more successful. Shortly thereafter, father and son established the Hart Music Center in San Carlos, California. In late 1965 or early 1966, Hart performed in an early iteration of William Penn and His Pals prior to Gregg Rolie&#x27;s membership and the recording of the garage rock classic &quot;Swami.&quot; Later in 1966, Hart and Bennett briefly resumed their collaboration before the latter reenlisted for a tour of duty in Vietnam.

By the end of the year, Hart had moved in with Michael Hinton, a student and friend who would accompany him to a Count Basie Orchestra performance at The Fillmore in mid-1967. At the concert, Hart help fulfill Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann&#x27;s request to meet Basie Orchestra drummer Sonny Payne, leading to an informal tutorial between Hart and Kreutzmann and his eventual introduction to the Grateful Dead.

==Career==
Hart joined the Grateful Dead in September 1967. His interests in polyrhythmic rudiments and exotic percussion were integral to the band&#x27;s arrangements in the period that archivist Dick Latvala would subsequently characterize as the &quot;primal Dead era&quot; of 1968–1969. However, he left by mutual agreement in February 1971, extricating himself after his father (who briefly managed the group) embezzled $70,000 from the band. In his 2015 memoir, Kreutzmann divulged that Hart&#x27;s use of heroin and other &quot;dark drugs&quot; had accelerated in the wake of the embezzlement and impacted his contributions to the group, also contributing to his departure: &quot;Mickey wasn&#x27;t able to play at the level he was capable of and it was beginning to affect our performances. He was getting really spacey and just getting so far out there that he wasn&#x27;t able to deliver the music. It became impossible for me to play with him. It wasn&#x27;t out of anger or meanness, but we had to address it and deal with it. So our brother Mickey left the band and retreated to his ranch in Novato and it really strained our relationship for a while, sad to say.&quot;

During his sabbatical, he released the album &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; in 1972. Two additional solo albums (including an ambient music project that was envisaged as the soundtrack for &quot;The Silent Flute&quot;, a screenplay co-written by Bruce Lee, James Coburn and Stirling Silliphant that was ultimately filmed in 1978 as the David Carradine vehicle &quot;Circle of Iron&quot;) were completed but rejected by Warner Brothers due to the label&#x27;s increasingly strained relationship with the Grateful Dead. Hart&#x27;s home recording studio proved to be a haven for the more idiosyncratic endeavors pursued by various band members, and he continued to collaborate with his former bandmates on various projects, most notably Robert Hunter&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the Great Rum Runners&quot; (1974) and Ned Lagin&#x27;s &quot;Seastones&quot; (1975).

He returned to the Dead for their final pre-hiatus concert in October 1974 and was formally reinstated by the beginning of the group&#x27;s 1976 tour. He remained with the group until their official dissolution in 1995. Hart&#x27;s collaboration with the remaining members of the Grateful Dead has continued with The Other Ones, The Dead and Dead &amp; Company.

Alongside his work with the Grateful Dead, Hart has performed as a solo artist, percussionist, and the author of several books. In these endeavors he has pursued a lifelong interest in ethnomusicology and world music.

Hart was influential in recording global musical traditions on the verge of possible extinction, working with archivists and ethnomusicologists at both the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress and the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage at the Smithsonian Institution. He is on the Board of Trustees of the American Folklife Center and has been a spokesperson for the &quot;Save Our Sounds&quot; audio preservation initiative. He also serves on the Library of Congress National Recorded Sound Preservation Board and is known for reissues and other recordings with historical and cultural value.

In 1991, Hart produced the album &quot;Planet Drum&quot;, which remained at #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; World Music chart for 26 weeks, and received the first ever Grammy Award for Best World Music Album.

Hart has written books on the history and traditions of drumming throughout history. His solo recordings (featuring a variety of guest musicians) are percussive but verge on New Age.

In 1994, Hart was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Grateful Dead.

In 2000, Hart became a member of the board of directors of the Institute for Music and Neurologic Function, a nonprofit organization that studies the healing power of music – continuing his investigation into the connection between healing and rhythm, and the neural basis of rhythm. In 2003, he was honored with the organization&#x27;s Music Has Power Award, recognizing his advocacy and continuous commitment to raising public awareness of the positive effect of music.


Hart was also a judge for the 3rd annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists&#x27; careers.

After the death of Jerry Garcia and the consequent dissolution of the Grateful Dead in 1995, Hart continued to play music with various groups including members of the Grateful Dead. In the 1996 Furthur Festival, Mickey Hart&#x27;s Mystery Box played, as did Bob Weir&#x27;s band, Ratdog.

In 2005, Hart and the members of the band Particle joined to create the Hydra Project.

During 2006, Hart teamed up with fellow Grateful Dead bandmate Bill Kreutzmann, Phish bassist Mike Gordon and former Other Ones lead guitarist Steve Kimock, to form the Rhythm Devils, a nickname that refers to Hart and Kreutzmann&#x27;s drum duets and improvisation. The band features songs from their respective repertoires as well as new songs written by Jerry Garcia&#x27;s songwriting companion Robert Hunter. The Rhythm Devils announced their first tour in 2006, which ended at the popular Vegoose festival in Las Vegas, Nevada over the Halloween weekend.

In June and July 2008, Hart led the Mickey Hart Band on a US concert tour. The band consists of Hart, Steve Kimock on guitar and pedal steel guitar, George Porter Jr. on bass, Kyle Hollingsworth on keyboards, Sikiru Adepoju on talking drum, Walfredo Reyes, Jr. on drums, and Jen Durkin on vocals.

In 2010 Hart debuted &quot;Rhythms of the Universe,&quot; a composition based on a variety of astrophysical data. The composition represents a collaboration between scientist and artist, using their own sophisticated tools. Nobel Laureate in physics George Smoot from the University of California, Berkeley, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), and Keith Jackson, a computer scientist and musician also from LBNL, are providing some of the data for the project. The final result will be a &quot;musical history of the universe&quot;, from the Big Bang onwards through galaxy and star formation, up until modern times, including images from the Hubble Space Telescope and rhythms derived from the cosmic microwave background radiation, supernovae, quasars, and many other astrophysical phenomena. The work premiered at the conference &quot;Cosmology on the Beach&quot; in Playa del Carmen in January 2010.

In April 2010, it was announced that Rhythm Devils will tour in the summer of 2010 with a new line-up including Hart and Bill Kreutzmann (assorted percussion), Keller Williams (guitar, vocals), Sikiru Adepoju (talking drum), Davy Knowles (guitar, vocals), and Andy Hess (bass).

The Rhythm Devils did only one show in 2011, at the Gathering of the Vibes Music Festival in Bridgeport, Connecticut. This version of the band was Hart, Kreutzmann, Keller Williams, Sikiru, Steve Kimock and Reed Mathis of Tea Leaf Green on bass.

In 2011 Hart debuted a new version of the Mickey Hart Band. This lineup included Tim Hockenberry (vocals, keyboards, trombone, saxophone, other instruments), Crystal Monee Hall (vocals, guitar, hand percussion), Ben Yonas (keyboards), Gawain Mathews (guitar), Sikiru Adepoju (talking drum, djembe, shakers), Ian &quot;Inkx&quot; Herman (drums), Greg Ellis (percussion), Vir McCoy (bass). The band played a few shows in August 2011 on the east and west coasts of the United States. In November and December 2011, the Mickey Hart Band did a 17-date tour with a slightly modified lineup. McCoy and Ellis were not in this lineup, and Widespread Panic band member Dave Schools joined the band as their bass player for the tour.

On October 11, 2011, Smithsonian Folkways released &quot;The Mickey Hart Collection&quot;. Comprising 25 albums, the series includes music from regions that span the globe, including the Sudan, Nigeria, Tibet, Indonesia, Latvia, and Brazil.
In August 2013, the Mickey Hart Band embarked upon a tour with the Tea Leaf Trio, which includes three members of the band Tea Leaf Green, in support of the band&#x27;s album &quot;Superorganism.&quot;

On September 29, 2013, the completed version of his and George Smoot&#x27;s film &quot;Rhythms of the Universe&quot; premiered at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.

In the summer of 2015, the surviving members of the Grateful Dead (Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart), joined by Trey Anastasio, Bruce Hornsby and Jeff Chimenti, performed a series of concerts to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Grateful Dead. The performances took place at Santa Clara&#x27;s Levi Stadium on June 27 and 28, 2015 and Chicago&#x27;s Soldier Field on July 3, 4 and 5, 2015. These performances marked the first time Weir, Lesh, Kreutzmann and Hart performed together since the Dead&#x27;s 2009 tour and was publicized as the final time the musicians will all perform together.

Also in 2015, Hart began touring with Dead &amp; Company, a band consisting of former Grateful Dead members Weir, Hart and Kreutzmann, along with John Mayer (guitar), Oteil Burbridge (bass), and Jeff Chimenti (keyboards). The band began touring in late 2015 and have conducted multiple tours since then. In 2017, he released &quot;RAMU&quot;, which featured contributions from both his long-time collaborators Steve Kimock and Sikiru Adepoju as well as Avey Tare and Tank Ball, among others.

<text>Miguel de Icaza (born November 23, 1972) is a Mexican-American programmer and activist, best known for starting the GNOME, Mono, and Xamarin projects.

==Biography==
===Early years===
De Icaza was born in Mexico City and studied Mathematics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), but dropped out before getting a degree to work in IT. He came from a family of scientists in which his father is a physicist and his mother a biologist. He started writing free software in 1992.

===Early software career===
One of the earliest pieces of software he wrote for Linux was the Midnight Commander file manager in 1994, a text-mode file manager. He was also one of the early contributors to the Wine project.

He worked with David S. Miller on the Linux SPARC port and wrote several of the video and network drivers in the port, as well as the libc ports to the platform. They both later worked on extending Linux for MIPS to run on SGI&#x27;s Indy computers and wrote the original X drivers for the system. With Ingo Molnár he wrote the original software implementation of RAID-1 and RAID-5 drivers of the Linux kernel.

In summer of 1997, he was interviewed by Microsoft for a job in the Internet Explorer Unix team (to work on a SPARC port), but lacked the university degree required to obtain a work H-1B visa. He said in an interview that he tried to persuade his interviewers to free the IE code even before Netscape did so with their own browser.

===GNOME, Ximian, Xamarin and Mono===
De Icaza started the GNOME project with Federico Mena in August 1997 to create a completely free desktop environment and component model for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. He also created the GNOME spreadsheet program, Gnumeric.

In 1999, de Icaza, along with Nat Friedman, co-founded Helix Code, a GNOME-oriented free software company that employed a large number of other GNOME hackers. In 2001, Helix Code, later renamed Ximian, announced the Mono Project, to be led by de Icaza, with the goal to implement Microsoft&#x27;s new .NET development platform on Linux and Unix-like platforms. In August 2003, Ximian was acquired by Novell. There, de Icaza was Vice President of Developer Platform.

In May 2011, de Icaza started Xamarin to replace MonoTouch and Mono for Android after Novell was bought by Attachmate and the projects were abandoned. Shortly afterwards, Xamarin and Novell reached an agreement where Xamarin took over the development and sales of these products.

In February 2016, Xamarin announced being acquired by Microsoft. One month later at the Microsoft Build conference, it was announced that the Mono Project would be relicensed to MIT, Visual Studio would include Xamarin (even the free versions) without restrictions, and Xamarin SDKs would be opensourced.

===Advocacy of Microsoft open technologies===
De Icaza endorsed Microsoft&#x27;s Office Open XML (OOXML) document standard, disagreeing with a lot of the widespread criticism in the open source and free-software community.

He also developed Mono – a free and open-source alternative to Microsoft&#x27;s .NET Framework – for GNOME. This has raised much disagreement due to the patents that Microsoft holds on the .NET Framework.

De Icaza was criticized by Richard Stallman on the Software Freedom Day 2009, who labeled him as &quot;Traitor to the Free Software Community&quot;. Icaza responded on his blog to Stallman with the remark that he believes in a &quot;world of possibility&quot; and that he is open for discussions on ways to improve the pool of open source and free software.

===Preference for Mac over Linux===
In August 2012, de Icaza criticized the Linux desktop as &quot;killed by Apple&quot;. De Icaza specifically criticized a generally developer-focused culture, lack of backward compatibility, and fragmentation among the various Linux distributions. In March 2013, de Icaza announced on his personal blog that he regularly used macOS instead of Linux for desktop computing.

===.NET Foundation director===
In 2014 he joined Anders Hejlsberg on stage during the announcements of the .NET Foundation and the open sourcing of Microsoft&#x27;s C# Compiler. He went on to serve on the board of directors of the .NET Foundation.

=== Leaving Microsoft ===
In March 2022 he announced he was leaving Microsoft and taking some time off.

==Awards and recognition==
Miguel de Icaza has received the Free Software Foundation 1999 Award for the Advancement of Free Software, the MIT Technology Review Innovator of the Year Award 1999, and was named one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 innovators for the new century in September 2000.

In early 2010 he received a Microsoft MVP Award.

In March 2010, he was named as the fifth in the &quot;Most Powerful Voices in Open Source&quot; by MindTouch.

==Personal life==
De Icaza has had cameo appearances in the 2001 motion pictures &quot;Antitrust&quot; and &quot;The Code.&quot;

He married Maria Laura Soares da Silva (now Maria Laura de Icaza) in 2003. They have three children. He has been living in the state of Massachusetts for 20 years.

De Icaza and his wife are critical of the actions of the state of Israel towards the Palestinians in the Middle East and has blogged about the subject and visited the area of conflict as well.
