<doc id="22048" wikidata="Q2740486" url="?curid=22048" title="Cuisine of New England">
<text>New England cuisine is an American cuisine which originated in the New England region of the United States, and traces its roots to traditional English cuisine and Native American cuisine of the Abenaki, Narragansett, Niantic, Wabanaki, Wampanoag, and other native peoples. It also includes influences from Irish, French-Canadian, Italian, and Portuguese cuisine, among others. It is characterized by extensive use of potatoes, beans, dairy products and seafood, resulting from its historical reliance on its seaports and fishing industry. Corn, the major crop historically grown by Native American tribes in New England, continues to be grown in all New England states, primarily as sweet corn although flint corn is grown as well. It is traditionally used in hasty puddings, cornbreads and corn chowders.

Many of New England&#x27;s earliest Puritan settlers were from eastern England, where baking foods (for instance, pies, beans, and turkey) was more common than frying, as was the tradition elsewhere.

Three prominent characteristic foodstuffs native to New England are maple syrup, cranberries and blueberries. The traditional standard starch is potato, though rice has a somewhat increased popularity in modern cooking. Traditional New England cuisine is known for a lack of strong spices, which is because of local 19th century health reformers, most prominently Sylvester Graham, who advocated eating bland food. Ground black pepper, parsley, garlic, and sage are common, with a few Caribbean additions such as nutmeg, plus several Italian spices.

The use of cream is common, due to the reliance on dairy. The favored cooking techniques are stewing, steaming, and baking. Many local ingredients, such as squash, corn and local beans, sunflowers, wild turkey, maple syrup, cranberries and dishes such as cornbread, Johnnycakes and Indian pudding were adopted from Native American cuisine.

==History==

===Early history===
The traditional diet of the Wampanoag Indians included chestnuts, beechnuts, walnuts, beans, multi-colored corn (called &quot;flint corn&quot;), and varieties of squash and pumpkins. Not strictly vegetarian, the traditional diet of the Wabanaki people is plant-centric and based on corn, beans, squash, sunflower seeds, sunchokes and groundcherries. The Wabanaki tribal nations did make plant milk and infant formula from nuts.

===American colonies===
In 1620, the newly arrived Pilgrims faced the prospect of surviving their first winter in Plymouth Colony. The climate was harsh and the growing season was shorter than they were accustomed to due to the long and frosty winters.

The newly arrived colonists brought vital techniques of food preservation like smoking, curing and drying that helped them survive the harsh New England winter. They also received help from the Wampanoag, who taught the newly arrived Pilgrims how to grow the staple crops of squash, beans and corn. It is not known for certain what crops were grown in early colonial gardens, but later sources mention turnips, onions, carrots, garlic and pumpkins.

The Pilgrims used corn to make hasty pudding and Wampanoag recipes like popcorn, &quot;sagamite&quot; and &quot;nasaump&quot;. The Wampanoag Indians also taught the Pilgrims to bake in hot ashes, and ash cakes (also called johnny cakes or breakfast bannocks) became a staple breakfast bread. Beans were used to make stews or combined with corn to make succotash.

Many of New England&#x27;s earliest Puritan settlers were from eastern England and brought with the traditions of English cuisine with them. Roast duck, goose, lamb, and hams were brought to what for them was a &quot;New World&quot; as farmyard stock as soon as the colonies began to prosper.

Even today, traditional English cuisine remains a strong part of New England&#x27;s identity. Some of its plates are now enjoyed by the entire United States, including clam chowder, baked beans, apple pies, baked or roast turkey, pease porridge, and steamed puddings.

===19th century===

Since the 1800s, New England&#x27;s culinary traditions have been influenced by the arrival of Irish Americans, Portuguese Americans, and Italian Americans. Irish-style braised pickled beef was the origin of New England boiled dinner.

&quot;Country stores&quot; sold homemade jams, fruit preserves and penny candy. Common crackers are still made with the original recipe dating to 1828.

Vegetarianism was practiced during the 18th and 19th century by individuals and families in Maine before the start of the modern vegetarian movement in 1817 in Philadelphia.

===20th century===
In the post-World War II era, July 4 celebrations frequently featured steak, hot dogs, hamburgers and grilled chicken. In the more distant past lamb was more traditional inland, and coastal communities in New England typically served salmon with dill mayo, peas, new potatoes and corn on the cob. Dessert often includes seasonal fruit, for example strawberry shortcake and blueberry pie.

=== 21st century ===
In the 21st century, more people in New England were eating vegan and vegetarian meals and more restaurants were serving them. In a &quot;Boston Globe&quot; article in 2022, it was reported how that four of the most traditional foods of New England cuisine (lobsters, corn, blueberries, and coffee) are among crops affected most by climate change and temperature and humidity changes.

==Traditional foods and drinks==

===Beer and alcohol===
Drinks in the Colonial era were made with local ingredients like honey, molasses, apples, hops and wild berries. These drinks included apple brandy (applejack), fruit wines, rum and mead. Some of the finest rum distilleries were located in New England prior to Prohibition.

The hot ale flip is a traditional drink historically made by mixing a pitcher of beer with rum, frothy eggs and a sweetener like dried pumpkin, maple syrup or molasses. The beverage was warmed by plunging a hot poker into the drink to caramelize the sugars creating the drink&#x27;s characteristic hot froth.

Like the flip, the Rattle-Skull was a mix of beer (in this case a dark beer like porter) and hard liquor—usually a mix of rum and brandy. The beverage is flavored with lime and garnished with nutmeg.

The Stone Fence was a mix of hard cider and rum. Reportedly, Ethan Allen and his men drank it before their raid of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775. Egg cider was made by cracking eggs into heated cider and adding a sweetener like molasses.

The cider-based beverage syllabub was made with rum, cream and sweetener. Mulled cider could be made with sweetener, spices, rum and egg yolks.

Birch beer, made with sap from the &quot;betula lenta&quot; tree, was made by both the English and early American colonists. The &quot;betula lenta&quot; is known for producing a fragrant sap with a unique minty flavor. John Mortimer wrote that birch beer was usually made by the poor by boiling birch sap with sugar and fermenting it with yeast.

Many local breweries produce lagers and ales. Notable examples include Samuel Adams of the Boston Beer Company in Boston (even though the recipe for the beer does not come from New England); Sea Dog Brewing Company of Bangor; Shipyard Brewing Company of Portland; Smuttynose Brewing Company of Portsmouth, New Hampshire; and Narragansett Brewing Company of Providence. Vermont-based Woodchuck Draft Cider is a popular alcoholic cider.

New England has also played a major role in the craft beer revolution, with Maine, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont having notable breweries such as Harpoon Brewery, Allagash Brewing Company, Treehouse Brewing Company, Trillium Brewing Company, The Alchemist Brewery, Jack&#x27;s Abby Brewing Company, Long Trail Brewing Company, Kent Falls Brewing Company and Two Roads Brewing Company.

=== Baked beans ===
Colonists learned to make baked beans from the Native American people. Baked beans are slowed cooked in an oven at a low temperature. They are sweetened, traditionally with maple syrup or molasses. The molasses is what sets them apart as New England baked beans. The Pilgrims and other early colonists were forbidden from cooking on Sundays, when these Christian communities observed the Sabbath, and this made baked beans a meal that is common for Saturday night dinner and all day Sunday. Two regional styles are Boston Baked Beans and Maine Baked Beans. The difference between the two styles is that Boston beans are made with small white navy beans or pea beans with thin skin while Maine beans are made with native bean varieties with thicker skins. These varieties are Marifax, soldier beans, and the most popular baked bean variety in Maine is the yellow-eye bean.

=== Casseroles, soups and stews ===
The custom of bringing one-dish casseroles (also called hot dishes) to barn raisings and church suppers was not exclusive to New England, but included traditional variations of baked beans and succotash. Modern recipes can be made with any ingredients available at markets. Seafood casseroles are made with cream sauce and bread crumb topping.

American chop suey is a casserole dish made with ground beef, macaroni and a seasoned tomato sauce. Though unrelated to Hungarian goulash, in other regions of the United States it may be called American goulash amongst other names. 

===Fruits===

Blueberries are made into jams and jellies and feature in breads and regional desserts like pies, cobblers and cakes.

Wild beach plums are foraged and used to make fruit preserves like jams and jellies. Beach plums were cultivated and used for the commercial manufacture of beach plum jelly in the 1930s, but beach plum products are no longer widely available in commercial markets.

The local purple concord grapes are a cross between native and European grapes. The large grapes are prized for their juiciness and used in the production of commercial grape juice, wine and grape jelly. It is a common ingredient in peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

Until the pilgrims planted apple seeds from Europe, the only regional apples were crab apples. Cross-pollination altered the results of these first attempts, but over the years thousands of new varieties were bred by the pilgrims. Massachusetts native John Chapman, known as Johnny Appleseed, was a nurseryman who spread apple trees across the midwest.

William Blaxton planted the first apple orchard in 1625. The earliest apple varieties produced in New England included Lady (1628), Roxbury Russet (1630), Pomme Grise (1650), Baldwin (1740), Porter (1800), Mother (1844) and Wright (1875). In modern times apples are grown commercially throughout Massachusetts.
The first attempts at commercial cranberry growing were pioneered by Captain Henry Hall, who developed the technique of covering the vines with sand to accelerate the plant&#x27;s growth.

===Hot dogs===
New England–style hot dog buns are split on top instead of on the side, and have a more rectangular shape. While smaller than common hot dog rolls, New England hot dog rolls have a larger soft surface area which allows for buttering and toasting, which are also commonly used for convenient serving of seafood like lobster or fried clams. Hot dog stands in Maine have long sold vegetarian hot dogs, but the region&#x27;s most famous hot dog variation is the &quot;Red Snapper&quot;– a natural-casing hotdog with a signature bright red coloration and snappy bite.

===Maple syrup===
Maple sap is collected annually during New England&#x27;s &quot;sugaring season&quot;. The new sap is reduced and thickened to form syrup. An issue of &quot;Yankee&quot; dating from 1939 gives some details on seasonal recipes with recipes for maple-butternut fudge, maple-sauce ice cream and &quot;Sugar on Snow&quot;. Sugar on Snow, a regional specialty also called maple syrup taffy, is made by pouring freshly heated maple syrup on fresh snow, forming candy with a taffy consistency as the syrup hardens.

Desserts like cobbler and maple custard pie were made with local sweeteners like maple sugar instead of sugar.

Molasses and rum were common in New England cuisine, due to New England&#x27;s involvement in the Triangle Trade in the 18th century. Molasses from the Caribbean and honey were staple sweeteners for all but the upper class well into the 19th century.

===Sandwiches===

Sandwiches typical of New England&#x27;s cuisine include baked bean on Boston brown bread; the Fluffernutter with Fluff marshmallow creme and peanut butter, usually served on Wonder bread, and the Maine Italian sandwich prepared using a long bread roll or bun with meats such as salami, mortadella, capicolla and ham along with provolone, tomato, onion, green bell pepper, Greek olives, olive oil or salad oil, salt and cracked black pepper.

Served cold or hot, lobster rolls can optionally include fixings like mayo or warmed butter, clam rolls dressed with tartar or cocktail sauce on a New England–style hot dog bun, and chow mein sandwich with noodles, celery, onions, meat and sauce in a hamburger bun, from Fall River, Massachusetts.

===Seafood===

The waters of the Gulf of Maine and Long Island Sound provide a rich variety of fish and shellfish that are a signature of the cuisine in New England.

Commercial cod fishing along Cape Ann dates back as far as 1623 when salt cod was carried by merchant vessels to Africa, which returned with slaves for plantations in the Caribbean before carrying sugar back to New England. Cod, the fish for which Cape Cod is named, remains a staple of the regional cuisine to this day.

Bluefish can be found throughout Cape Cod and Nantucket during the summer months and is consumed smoked, broiled or sauteed. American lobster is usually consumed grilled, steamed, or boiled.

Breaded deep-fried clams are popular pub fare in New England. Regional clam varieties can be soft shell or hard shell and include razor clams, the latter of these is more likely to be caught by hand owing to how difficult it is to harvest them without damaging the beach upon which they dwell.

Hard-shell clams are sometimes called littlenecks, cherrystones or quahogs depending on their size. These are used to make New England–style clam chowder, and may also be consumed steamed or even raw. The preferred methods of preparing soft-shell clams (also called steamers) are frying or steaming.

Adapted from the American Indians, the clambake is a traditional meal in New England where clams, lobsters and corn are cooked over a firepit. Modern versions of the dish may include mussels, fish, crabs and non-seafood ingredients like chicken, sausage, potatoes and other root vegetables.

The official state fish are as follows:

===Seasonings===
Many herbs were uncommon, particularly Mediterranean herbs, which are not hardy in much of New England away from the coast. As a result, most savory New England dishes do not have much strong seasoning, aside from salt and ground black pepper, nor are there many particularly spicy staple items.

Other dishes meant as desserts often contain ingredients such as nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, and ground ginger which are a legacy of trade with the Caribbean region beginning in the 17th century, lasting well into the 19th.

===Pizza===
Much of the pizza in New England is Greek pizza, owing to the strong presence of Greek immigrants and Greek Americans in the food-service industry in New England. Greek pizza (as understood in New England) is typified by its chewy, bready crust similar to focaccia, which is baked in shallow, round metal pan liberally coated with olive oil. Greek-style pizzerias in New England are often found under the name House of Pizza.

Italians emigrated to New England beginning a little over a century ago, 
and Southern New England pizza tends to be more Italian influenced. World-famous restaurants such as Pepe&#x27;s Pizza in New Haven, CT serve a thin, coal-fired hand-tossed style of pie. New Haven–style pizza is typified by a slightly burnt, crunchy exterior crust and soft, slightly chewy interior. Southern New England pizza (or apizza) is closely related to Neapolitan-style pizza.
=== List of foods common to New England cuisine ===
==Regional specialties==

===Connecticut===
In Connecticut, Irish-American influences are common in the interior portions of the state, including the Hartford area. During the 18th century the Hartford election cake was a spicy, boozy yeast-leavened cake based on a traditional English holiday cake.

During the colonial era, elections were celebrated with a drink and a huge celebration cake large enough to feed the entire community, and the recipe as given by Amelia Simmons in 1796 called for butter, sugar, raisins, eggs, wine and spices in enormous quantities. Hasty pudding is sometimes found in rural communities, particularly around Thanksgiving.

Italian-inspired cuisine is dominant in the New Haven area, which is known for charred thin-crust New Haven–style pizza baked in coal-fired ovens. The well-known white clam pie is made with fresh clams, olive oil, fresh garlic, oregano and grated Romano cheese.

Some pizza places also offer subs on Italian bread (&quot;grinders&quot;) and standard Italian fare like eggplant rollatini, manicotti, baked ziti and chicken parmesan. Well-known pizzerias include Pepe&#x27;s Pizza, Sally&#x27;s Apizza and Modern Apizza.

The cuisine of Southeastern Connecticut is heavily based on the local fishing industry. Typical New England seafood dishes are available at local restaurants like Abbot&#x27;s Lobster in the Rough. Lobster rolls, crab cakes, oysters, clam chowder, steamer clams and mussels are served with sides like potato chips, remoulade sauce and coleslaw.

Shad is the state fish and is cooked on planks (usually hickory, oak, or cedar) by the fire, called a &quot;shad bake&quot;, deboning the fish requires some skill with a boning knife.

Louis&#x27; Lunch began as a lunch wagon started by Danish immigrant Louis Lassen in 1895. Their burgers are still cooked in the original antique cast-iron broiler.

A local specialty of Meriden, Connecticut, steamed cheeseburgers started as simple steamed cheese on a roll sandwiches sold off horse-drawn food carts in the 1900s. Some believe the hamburger originated in New Haven at Louis&#x27;, and like the butter burger and deep-fried hamburger, the steamed version may be a remnant of an earlier time before the broiled hamburger on a bun became the standard form.

Ice cream is made with milk from local creameries at UCONN Dairy Bar using a century-old recipe to produce 24 different flavors of ice cream. Ferris Acres Creamery is a 150-year-old dairy farm offering 50 flavors of ice cream. The most popular is the &quot;Cow Trax&quot;, a base of vanilla with peanut butter swirls and chocolate chips.

===Maine===

Maine is known for two sandwiches, the lobster roll—lobster meat mixed with mayonnaise and other ingredients, served in a grilled hot dog roll in the summer, particularly on the coast in locations that serve tourists—and the Maine Italian sandwich—a submarine sandwich. Baked beans are very popular in Maine. Early white settlers learned to make baked beans from the Wabanaki. They were originally sweetened with maple syrup. The Atlantic Triangular Trade caused colonists to swap molasses for maple syrup. Maine cooks prefer old style bean varieties such as Yellow Eyes, Jacobs Cattle, Soldier, and Marafax. Bean-hole beans were a staple at Maine lumber camps.

Buckwheat pancakes called ployes are popular in Maine. Ployes are an Acadian pancake-type mix of buckwheat flour, wheat flour, baking powder and water, which is extremely popular in the Madawaska region, in New Brunswick and in Maine. With local toppings, such as maple syrup or cretons, ployes can vary in taste. This staple is popular with vegans and is often eaten with baked beans.

Wabanaki influences are common in Maine, and many staple foods including beans, corn, squash, wild blueberries, maple syrup, and seafood are part of traditional Wabanaki cuisine. Fiddlehead ferns are part of Wabanaki cuisine and are still prized in Maine, where they are gathered in springtime. Foraging remains popular in Maine and people also forage for mushrooms, hazelnuts, acorns, elderberries, dandelions and ramps. Maine is known for its seaweed that is used in many dishes as a seasoning and even included in snack bars.

Maine has a high number or organic farms. Maine is home to the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association, founded in 1971 and is the oldest organic farming organization in the country. The 1970 book &quot;Living the Good Life&quot; by Maine residents Helen Nearing and Scott Nearing caused many young people to move to Maine and engage in small-scale farming and homesteading and this increased the population of the state and the access to local vegetables. Maine is home to over 100 summer farmers&#x27; markets and over 30 winter farmers&#x27; markets.

Northern Maine produces potato crops, second only to Idaho in the United States. Because of this potatoes are very popular in Maine food and even an ingredient in sweets, like doughnuts and chocolate candy. Poutine is popular throughout Maine.

Maine is the only state with a commercial wild blueberry industry, where growers harvested 105 million pounds in 2021. Wild blueberries are a common ingredient or garnish, and blueberry pie is the official state dessert (when made with wild Maine blueberries). Wild blueberry pancakes, muffins, doughnuts and ice cream are popular in Maine. Apple picking and apple desserts, particularly apple pie and apple cider doughnuts, are popular in Maine. Apples have been grown in Maine since the earliest colonial settlements. One of the earliest recorded Maine orchards was Anthony Brackett&#x27;s farm and orchard in Portland. Brackett&#x27;s orchard was near the current Deering Oaks and it was destroyed in 1689 during a major battle of the French and Indian Wars.

Maple syrup, maple sugar and maple candies are regularly eaten in Maine. Maine grist mills grind yellow field peas to create a flour chefs use to make gluten-free and vegan foods such as mayonnaise. Moxie was America&#x27;s first mass-produced soft drink and is the official state soft drink. Moxie is known for its strong aftertaste and is found throughout New England.

Maine people consume the second most ice cream per capita in the United States, and many Maine ice cream shops make and sell vegan ice creams. Ice cream was first made in Maine in 1825 at the Portland home of Asa Clapp to honor a visit to the city by Marquis de Lafayette. The whoopie pie, which is also a staple in the Philadelphia/Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine, is the official state treat. The first documented bakery in America to sell whoopie pies was Labadie&#x27;s Bakery in Lewiston, which first sold them in 1925 (although possibly as early as 1918). Maine sea captain Hansen Gregory claimed to have invented the doughnut with a hole in the center in 1847, and there is a plaque dedicated to him in his birthplace Rockport. Maine is known for varieties ranging from potato doughnuts to vegan doughnuts. Maine is the place of origin for the needham, a dessert bar made from chocolate, coconut, and potato. Wax-wrapped salt water taffy is a popular item sold in tourist areas, although it is originally from New Jersey.

The city of Portland has been recognized for its restaurant scene. &quot;Bon Appetit&quot; magazine recognized Portland as the &quot;2018 Restaurant City of the Year&quot;. The city has the Portland Farmers Market, founded in 1768, and the city ranks as a top city for vegans and vegetarians. The Francophone part of northern Maine in the St. John Valley has a lot of Acadian influences in their cuisine. A popular dish among all Acadians in this region is &quot;tourtière&quot; or meat pies. These are especially popular around Christmas time.

===Massachusetts===
Coastal Massachusetts is known for its clams, haddock, and cranberries, and previously cod. Massachusetts had similar immigrant influences as the coastal regions, though historically strong Eastern European populations instilled kielbasa and pierogi as common dishes.

Named after the town of Newton, Fig Newtons were first made in 1891 using a machine invented by James Mitchell to fill cookie dough with fig jam. The small round Necco Wafers, made with the first American candy machine, similarly originated in Cambridge. Graham bread was first made in 19th-century Massachusetts by Sylvester Graham. Tollhouse cookies, the original chocolate chip cookie and official state cookie of Massachusetts were created in 1930 at the Toll House Inn, located in Whitman.
Boston is known for, baked beans (hence the nickname &quot;Beantown&quot;), bulkie rolls, and various pastries. Boston cream pie is not a pie but a cake with custard filling. The origins are mysterious, but it is likely that antecedent cakes were made with either a sponge cake or a pound cake.

Parker&#x27;s Restaurant, located inside the Parker House Hotel, was the premier dining establishment in Boston in the 19th century and remains a fine-dining establishment in Boston&#x27;s Government Center area. The a-la-carte menu from 1865 included a range of local seafood offerings like oysters, fried clams, mackerel, shad, salmon in anchovy sauce, cod in oyster sauce, and soft-shell crab. Other meat dishes included chicken fricassee, potted pigeons, corned beef and baked beans with pork. Sides included corn, rice, macaroni, potatoes, asparagus, green peas, radishes and fried bananas. Sweet pastry and puddings were also served such as Indian pudding, custard, apple pie, rhubarb pie, Washington pie, Charlotte Russe, and blancmange. The restaurant was also famous for creating the Parker House roll, which is now popular throughout the United States.

The North Shore area is locally known for its roast beef sandwich shops, typically serving roast beef sandwiches consisting of thin-sliced roast beef on a hamburger bun. It may be served with condiments such as lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, and sauces such as mayo and barbecue. Most pizza and roast beef sandwich shops also serve &quot;steak tips&quot; (marinated cubes of sirloin), a common menu item at pizza establishments and backyard cookouts.

Marshmallow Fluff was invented in Somerville, Massachusetts and manufactured in Lynn, Massachusetts throughout the 20th century. Fluffernutter sandwiches, combining peanut butter with marshmallow fluff, are popular.

The South Shore area maintains a following for bar pizza, with many popular restaurants serving these crisp, thin, often heavily topped creations.

Common plant foods in Massachusetts are similar to those of interior northern New England, because of the landlocked, hilly terrain, including potatoes, maple syrup, and wild blueberries. Dairy production is also prominent in this central and western area.

===New Hampshire===

Southern New Hampshire cuisine is similar to that of the Boston area, featuring fish, shellfish, and local apples. As with Maine and Vermont, French-Canadian dishes are popular, including &quot;tourtière&quot;, which is traditionally served on Christmas Eve, and poutine. Corn chowder is also common, which is similar to clam chowder but with corn and bacon replacing the clams. Portsmouth is known for its orange cake.

===Rhode Island===

Rhode Island is known for johnnycakes, doughboys, and clam cakes.

Johnnycakes, variously and contentiously known as jonnycakes, journeycakes and Shawnee cakes, can vary in thickness and preparation, and disagreements over whether they should be made with milk or water persist.

East of Narragansett Bay, johnnycakes are made with cold milk and a little butter, but around South County the batter is sweetened and made with scalded cornmeal. One attempt by the Rhode Island Legislature to settle on an &quot;authentic&quot; recipe ended in a fistfight.

They were traditionally served as a flatbread alongside chipped beef or baked beans, but in modern times they are usually eaten for breakfast with butter and maple syrup.

According to The Society for the Propagation of the Johnnycake Tradition in Rhode Island, authentic johnnycakes must be made with whitecap flint corn historically grown in the region around Narrangasett Bay. Stone-ground flint corn is not commercially available, but can still be found at a few historic gristmills like the Prescott Farm museum in Middletown.

Sweetened coffee-flavored dairy products are popular in Rhode Island. Coffee ice cream is popular and a locally produced coffee gelatin dessert mix can be found at supermarkets. Coffee milk has been the official state drink since 1993. While the origins may date to the 1930s, when some shopkeeps sweetened leftover coffee ground with milk and sugar, its now made with coffee extract syrups like those produced by Autocrat.

Also popular in the state are clear clam chowder known as Rhode Island clam chowder, quahogs, milkshakes (called cabinets), submarine sandwiches (called grinders), pizza strips, the chow mein sandwich, and Del&#x27;s Frozen Lemonade. Italian cooking is long established in the region.

In Rhode Island and other parts of New England with a large Portuguese American population, Portuguese foods are common, including &quot;linguiça&quot;, &quot;chouriço&quot;, &quot;caldo verde&quot;, &quot;malasadas&quot;, and Portuguese sweet bread.

===Vermont===

Vermont produces cheddar cheese and other dairy products. Small cheesemakers recognized for producing hand-crafted cheddar cheeses include the Crowley Cheese Factory Grafton Village Cheese Company, and Shelburne Farms.

The Vermonter sandwich is made with cold cuts (often turkey and ham), apple, sharp Vermont cheddar and maple mustard (a mix of maple syrup and grainy mustard). The toasted sandwich is served warm.

It is known in and outside of New England for its maple syrup. Maple syrup is used as an ingredient in some Vermont dishes, including baked beans. Rhubarb pie is a common dessert and has been combined with strawberries in late spring.

==Restaurants and pubs==
The oldest continuously operating restaurant in the United States is the Union Oyster House (1826) located in Boston. The oldest operating restaurant is the White Horse Tavern in Newport, Rhode Island (it had, at one point closed for renovations since its inception).

Legal Sea Foods is a chain restaurant that began by selling fresh fish and fish and chips. The original 1950 shop was located at Cambridge&#x27;s Inman Square.

Woodman&#x27;s of Essex began selling homemade potato chips in 1914. Their signature dish of fried clams was introduced only a few years later, in 1916. Their chowder has won prizes at the annual Essex Clamfest.

Friendly&#x27;s was founded in 1935 during the Great Depression in Springfield, Massachusetts as an ice-cream parlor selling two scoops for a nickel. By 1960, the company offered 63 flavors of ice cream. They were producing 25 million gallons per year and had moved their headquarters to Wilbraham. It only becomes a full-service chain restaurant after being acquired by Donald Smith in 1988.

At local shops along the North Shore of Massachusetts, &quot;three-way&quot; roast beef sandwiches are often served on an onion roll and topped with mayo, barbecue sauce and white American cheese. Kelly&#x27;s Roast Beef claims to have originated the first roast beef sandwich. Open-faced roast beef sandwiches predate Kelly&#x27;s version but are typically eaten with a knife and fork. Other well-known North Shore roast beef shops include Londi&#x27;s and Bill &amp; Bob&#x27;s.

D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s is a regional chain with locations in Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts specializing in subs (called heroes in New York and hoagies in Philadelphia). Their first shop opened in Dedham, Massachusetts in 1967. They serve foot-long lobster rolls and other sandwich varieties like steak and cheese.

Italian sandwiches are the specialty of Moe&#x27;s Italian Sandwiches, founded in Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1959. Based on a family recipe, their sandwich is made with salami, provolone, veggies, spices and olive oil. Amato&#x27;s claims to have originated the Maine Italian sandwich, made with ham, American cheese, onion, sour pickles, tomatoes, black olives, green peppers and olive oil.

==Food and dairy industries==
Fluff marshmallow creme, used to make Fluffernutter sandwiches, is made in Lynn, Massachusetts. Welch&#x27;s, headquartered in Concord, Massachusetts, produces grape juices, jellies and jams from purple Concord grapes. The company has been owned by the National Grape Cooperative Association since 1956.

Autocrat is a company based in Lincoln, Rhode Island that produces coffee and tea extracts. Their coffee syrups are used to make coffee milk which became the official state drink of Rhode Island in 1993.

The Moxie Beverage Company of Bedford, New Hampshire, acquired by the Coca-Cola Company in 2018, produces the Moxie soft drink. Flavored with gentian root extract, Moxie has been the official soft drink of Maine since May 10, 2005.

Organic dairy company Stonyfield Farm, owned by the French dairy company Lactalis, is located in Londonderry, New Hampshire. Ice-cream company Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s, purchased in 2000 by the Anglo-Dutch company Unilever, was founded in 1978 in Burlington, Vermont.

<text>Marvin Neil Simon (July 4, 1927 – August 26, 2018) was an American playwright, screenwriter and author. He wrote more than 30 plays and nearly the same number of movie screenplays, mostly film adaptations of his plays. He received three Tony Awards and a Golden Globe Award, as well as nominations for four Academy Awards and four Primetime Emmy Awards. He was awarded a Special Tony Award in 1975, the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1991, the Kennedy Center Honors in 1995 and the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2006.

Simon grew up in New York City during the Great Depression. His parents&#x27; financial difficulties affected their marriage, giving him a mostly unhappy and unstable childhood. He often took refuge in movie theaters, where he enjoyed watching early comedians like Charlie Chaplin. After graduating from high school and serving a few years in the Army Air Force Reserve, he began writing comedy scripts for radio programs and popular early television shows. Among the latter were Sid Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; (where in 1950 he worked alongside other young writers including Carl Reiner, Mel Brooks, Woody Allen, Larry Gelbart and Selma Diamond), and &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;, which ran from 1955 to 1959.

His first produced play was &quot;Come Blow Your Horn&quot; (1961). It took him three years to complete and ran for 678 performances on Broadway. It was followed by two more successes, &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; (1965). He won a Tony Award for the latter. It made him a national celebrity and &quot;the hottest new playwright on Broadway&quot;. From the 1960s to the 1980s, he wrote for stage and screen; some of his screenplays were based on his own works for the stage. His style ranged from farce to romantic comedy to more serious dramatic comedy.

Overall, he garnered 17 Tony nominations and won three awards. In 1966, he had four successful productions running on Broadway at the same time and, in 1983, he became the only living playwright to have a New York theatre, the Neil Simon Theatre, named in his honor.

== Early years ==
Neil Simon was born on July 4, 1927, in The Bronx, New York City, to Jewish parents. His father, Irving Simon, was a garment salesman, and his mother, Mamie (Levy) Simon, was mostly a homemaker. Neil had one brother, eight years his senior, television writer and comedy teacher Danny Simon. He grew up in Washington Heights, Manhattan, and graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School when he was sixteen. He was nicknamed &#x27;Doc&#x27;, and the school yearbook described him as extremely shy.

Simon&#x27;s childhood was marked by his parents&#x27; &quot;tempestuous marriage&quot; and the financial hardship caused by the Depression. Sometimes at night he blocked out their arguments by putting a pillow over his ears. His father often abandoned the family for months at a time, causing them further financial and emotional suffering. As a result, the family took in boarders, and Simon and his brother Danny were sometimes forced to live with different relatives.

During an interview with writer Lawrence Grobel, Simon said: &quot;To this day I never really knew what the reason for all the fights and battles were about between the two of them ... She&#x27;d hate him and be very angry, but he would come back and she would take him back. She really loved him.&quot; Simon has said that one of the reasons he became a writer was to fulfill a need to be independent of such emotional family issues, a need he recognized when he was seven or eight: &quot;I&#x27;d better start taking care of myself somehow ... It made me strong as an independent person.

He was able to do that at the movies, in the work of stars like Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Laurel and Hardy. &quot;I was constantly being dragged out of movies for laughing too loud.&quot; Simon acknowledged these childhood films as his inspiration: &quot;I wanted to make a whole audience fall onto the floor, writhing and laughing so hard that some of them pass out.&quot; He made writing comedy his long-term goal, and also saw it as a way to connect with people. &quot;I was never going to be an athlete or a doctor.&quot; He began writing for pay while still in high school: At the age of fifteen, Simon and his brother created a series of comedy sketches for employees at an annual department store event. To help develop his writing skill, he often spent three days a week at the library reading books by famous humorists such as Mark Twain, Robert Benchley, George S. Kaufman and S. J. Perelman.

Soon after graduating from high school, he signed up with the Army Air Force Reserve at New York University. He attained the rank of corporal and was eventually sent to Colorado. During those years in the Reserve, Simon wrote professionally, starting as a sports editor. He was assigned to Lowry Air Force Base during 1945 and attended the University of Denver from 1945 to 1946.

== Writing career ==
=== Television ===

Simon quit his job as a mailroom clerk in the Warner Brothers offices in Manhattan to write radio and television scripts with his brother Danny Simon, under the tutelage of radio humorist Goodman Ace, who ran a short-lived writing workshop for CBS. Their work for the radio series &quot;The Robert Q. Lewis Show&quot; led to other writing jobs. Max Liebman hired the duo for the writing team of his popular television comedy series &quot;Your Show of Shows.&quot; The program received Emmy Award nominations for Best Variety Show in 1951, 1952, 1953, and 1954, and won in 1952 and 1953. Simon later wrote scripts for &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;, for episodes broadcast during 1958 and 1959.

Simon later recalled the importance of these two writing jobs to his career: &quot;Between the two of them, I spent five years and learned more about what I was eventually going to do than in any other previous experience.&quot; &quot;I knew when I walked into &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;, that this was the most talented group of writers that up until that time had ever been assembled together.&quot;

Simon described a typical writing session:

Simon incorporated some of these experiences into his play &quot;Laughter on the 23rd Floor&quot; (1993). A 2001 TV adaptation of the play won him two Emmy Award nominations.

=== Stage ===
His first Broadway experience was on &quot;Catch a Star!&quot; (1955); he collaborated on sketches with his brother, Danny.

In 1961, Simon&#x27;s first Broadway play, &quot;Come Blow Your Horn&quot;, ran for 678 performances at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre. Simon took three years to create that first play, partly because he was also working on television scripts. He rewrote it at least twenty times from beginning to end: &quot;It was the lack of belief in myself&quot;, he recalled. &quot;I said, &#x27;This isn&#x27;t good enough. It&#x27;s not right.&#x27; ... It was the equivalent of three years of college.&quot; Besides being a &quot;monumental effort&quot; for Simon, that play was a turning point in his career: &quot;The theater and I discovered each other.&quot;
&quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; (1965), for which he won a Tony Award, brought him national celebrity, and he was considered &quot;the hottest new playwright on Broadway&quot;, according to Susan Koprince. Those successes were followed by others. During 1966, Simon had four shows playing simultaneously at Broadway theatres: &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;, &quot;The Star-Spangled Girl&quot;, &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; and &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot;. These earned him royalties of $1 million a year. His professional association with producer Emanuel Azenberg began with &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; and continued with &quot;The Good Doctor&quot;, &quot;God&#x27;s Favorite&quot;, &quot;Chapter Two&quot;, &quot;They&#x27;re Playing Our Song&quot;, &quot;I Ought to Be in Pictures&quot;, &quot;Brighton Beach Memoirs&quot;, &quot;Biloxi Blues&quot;, &quot;Broadway Bound&quot;, &quot;Jake&#x27;s Women&quot;, &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; and &quot;Laughter on the 23rd Floor&quot;, among others. His work ranged from romantic comedies to serious drama. Overall, he received seventeen Tony nominations and won three awards.

Simon also adapted material originated by others, such as the musical &quot;Little Me&quot; (1962), based on the novel by Patrick Dennis; &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; (1966) from the screenplay for the film &quot;Nights of Cabiria (&quot;1957), written by Federico Fellini and others; and &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; (1968) a musical version of Billy Wilder&#x27;s film, &quot;The Apartment&quot;. By the time of &quot;Last of the Red Hot Lovers&quot; in 1969, Simon was reputedly earning $45,000 a week from his shows (excluding sale of rights), making him the most financially successful Broadway writer ever. Simon also served as an uncredited &quot;script doctor&quot;, helping to hone the books of Broadway-bound plays or musicals under development, as he did for &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; (1975). During the 1970s, he wrote a string of successful plays; sometimes more than one was playing at the same time, to standing room only audiences. Although he was, by then, recognized as one of the country&#x27;s leading playwrights, his inner drive kept him writing:
Simon drew &quot;extensively on his own life and experience&quot; for his stories. His settings are typically working-class New York City neighborhoods, similar to the ones in which he grew up. In 1983, he began writing the first of three autobiographical plays, &quot;Brighton Beach Memoirs&quot; (1983), which would be followed by &quot;Biloxi Blues&quot; (1985) and &quot;Broadway Bound&quot; (1986). He received his greatest critical acclaim for this trilogy. He received a Pulitzer Prize for his follow-up play, &quot;Lost in Yonkers&quot; (1991), which starred Mercedes Ruehl and was a success on Broadway.

Following &quot;Lost in Yonkers&quot;, Simon&#x27;s next several plays did not meet with commercial success. &quot;The Dinner Party&quot; (2000), which starred Henry Winkler and John Ritter, was &quot;a modest hit&quot;. Simon&#x27;s final play, &quot;Rose&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, premiered in 2003 and received poor reviews.

Simon is credited as playwright and contributing writer to at least 49 Broadway plays.

=== Screen ===
Simon chose not to write the screenplay for the first film adaptation of his work, &quot;Come Blow Your Horn&quot; (1963), preferring to focus on his playwriting. However, he was disappointed with the picture, and thereafter tried to control the conversion of his works. Simon wrote screenplays for more than twenty films and received four Academy Award nominations—for &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; (1969), &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; (1975), &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; (1977) and &quot;California Suite&quot; (1978). Other movies include &quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot; (1970) and &quot;Murder by Death&quot; (1976). Although most of his films were successful, movies were always of secondary importance to his plays:

Many of his earlier adaptations of his own work were very similar to the original plays. Simon observed in hindsight: &quot;I really didn&#x27;t have an interest in films then. I was mainly interested in continuing writing for the theater ... The plays never became cinematic&quot;. &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; (1968), was one highly successful early adaptation, faithful to the stage play but also opened out, with more scenic variety.

== Writing style and subject matter ==
The key aspect most consistent in Simon&#x27;s writing style is comedy, situational and verbal, and presents serious subjects in a way that makes audiences &quot;laugh to avoid weeping&quot;. He achieved this with rapid-fire jokes and wisecracks, in a wide variety of urban settings and stories. This creates a &quot;sophisticated, urban humor&quot;, says editor Kimball King, and results in plays that represent &quot;middle America&quot;. Simon created everyday, apparently simple conflicts with his stories, which became comical premises for problems which needed be solved.

Another feature of his writing is his adherence to traditional values regarding marriage and family. McGovern states that this thread of the monogamous family runs through most of Simon&#x27;s work, and is one he feels is necessary to give stability to society. Some critics have therefore described his stories as somewhat old fashioned, although Johnson points out that most members of his audiences &quot;are delighted to find Simon upholding their own beliefs&quot;. And where infidelity is the theme in a Simon play, rarely, if ever, do those characters gain happiness: &quot;In Simon&#x27;s eyes,&quot; adds Johnson, &quot;divorce is never a victory.&quot;

Another aspect of Simon&#x27;s style is his ability to combine both comedy and drama. &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot;, for example, is a light romantic comedy, while portions of &quot;Plaza Suite&quot; were written as &quot;farce&quot;, and portions of &quot;California Suite&quot; are &quot;high comedy&quot;.

Simon was willing to experiment and take risks, often moving his plays in new and unexpected directions. In &quot;The Gingerbread Lady&quot;, he combined comedy with tragedy; &quot;Rumors&quot; (1988) is a full-length farce; in &quot;Jake&#x27;s Women&quot; and &quot;Brighton Beach Memoirs&quot; he used dramatic narration; in &quot;The Good Doctor&quot;, he created a &quot;pastiche of sketches&quot; around various stories by Chekhov; and &quot;Fools&quot; (1981), was written as a fairy-tale romance similar to stories by Sholem Aleichem. Although some of these efforts failed to win approval from many critics, Koprince claims that they nonetheless demonstrate Simon&#x27;s &quot;seriousness as a playwright and his interest in breaking new ground.&quot;

=== Characters ===
Simon&#x27;s characters are typically &quot;imperfect, unheroic figures who are at heart decent human beings&quot;, according to Koprince, and she traces Simon&#x27;s style of comedy back to that of Menander, a playwright of ancient Greece. Menander, like Simon, also used average people in domestic life settings, and also blended humor and tragedy into his themes. Many of Simon&#x27;s most memorable plays are built around two-character scenes, as in segments of &quot;California Suite&quot; and &quot;Plaza Suite&quot;.

Before writing, Simon tried to create an image of his characters. He said that the play &quot;Star Spangled Girl&quot;, which was a box-office failure, was &quot;the only play I ever wrote where I did not have a clear visual image of the characters in my mind as I sat down at the typewriter.&quot; Simon considered &quot;character building&quot; an obligation, stating that the &quot;trick is to do it skillfully&quot;. While other writers have created vivid characters, they have not created nearly as many as Simon did: &quot;Simon has no peers among contemporary comedy playwrights&quot;, stated biographer Robert Johnson.

Simon&#x27;s characters often amuse the audience with sparkling &quot;zingers&quot;, made believable by Simon&#x27;s skillful writing of dialogue. He reproduces speech so &quot;adroitly&quot; that his characters are usually plausible and easy for audiences to identify with and laugh at. His characters may also express &quot;serious and continuing concerns of mankind ... rather than purely topical material&quot;. McGovern notes that his characters are always impatient &quot;with phoniness, with shallowness, with amorality&quot;, adding that they sometimes express &quot;implicit and explicit criticism of modern urban life with its stress, its vacuity, and its materialism.&quot; However, Simon&#x27;s characters are never seen thumbing their noses at society.&quot;

=== Themes and genres ===
Theater critic John Lahr believes that Simon&#x27;s primary theme is &quot;the silent majority&quot;, many of whom are &quot;frustrated, edgy, and insecure&quot;. Simon&#x27;s characters are &quot;likable&quot; and easy for audiences to identify with. They often have difficult relationships in marriage, friendship or business, as they &quot;struggle to find a sense of belonging&quot;. According to biographer Edythe McGovern, there is always &quot;an implied seeking for solutions to human problems through relationships with other people, [and] Simon is able to deal with serious topics of universal and enduring concern&quot;, while still making people laugh.

McGovern adds that one of Simon&#x27;s hallmarks is his &quot;great compassion for his fellow human beings&quot;, an opinion shared by author Alan Cooper, who observes that Simon&#x27;s plays &quot;are essentially about friendships, even when they are about marriage or siblings or crazy aunts ...&quot;

Many of Simon&#x27;s plays are set in New York City, with a resulting urban flavor. Within that setting, Simon&#x27;s themes include marital conflict, infidelity, sibling rivalry, adolescence, bereavement and fear of aging. Despite the serious nature of these ideas, Simon always manages to tell the stories with humor, embracing both realism and comedy. Simon would tell aspiring comedy playwrights &quot;not to try to make it funny ... try and make it real and then the comedy will come.&quot;

&quot;When I was writing plays&quot;, he said, &quot;I was almost always (with some exceptions) writing a drama that was funny ... I wanted to tell a story about real people.&quot; Simon explained how he managed this combination:
His comedies often portray struggles with marital difficulties or fading love, sometimes leading to separation, divorce and child custody issues. After many twists in the plot, the endings typically show renewal of the relationships.

Politics seldom plays in Simon&#x27;s stories, and his characters avoid confronting society as a whole, despite their personal problems. &quot;Simon is simply interested in showing human beings as they are—with their foibles, eccentricities, and absurdities.&quot; Drama critic Richard Eder noted that Simon&#x27;s popularity relies on his ability to portray a &quot;painful comedy&quot;, where characters say and do funny things in extreme contrast to the unhappiness they are feeling.

Simon&#x27;s plays are generally semi-autobiographical, often portraying aspects of his troubled childhood and first marriages. According to Koprince, Simon&#x27;s plays also &quot;invariably depict the plight of white middle-class Americans, most of whom are New Yorkers and many of whom are Jewish, like himself.&quot; He has said, &quot;I suppose you could practically trace my life through my plays.&quot; In &quot;Lost in Yonkers&quot;, Simon suggests the necessity of a loving marriage (as opposed to his parents&#x27;), and how children who are deprived of it in their home, &quot;end up emotionally damaged and lost&quot;.

According to Koprince, Simon&#x27;s Jewish heritage is a key influence on his work, although he is unaware of it when writing. For example, in the &quot;Brighton Beach&quot; trilogy, she explains, the lead character is a &quot;master of self-deprecating humor, cleverly poking fun at himself and at his Jewish culture as a whole.&quot; Simon himself has said that his characters are people who are &quot;often self-deprecating and [who] usually see life from the grimmest point of view&quot;, explaining, &quot;I see humor in even the grimmest of situations. And I think it&#x27;s possible to write a play so moving it can tear you apart and still have humor in it.&quot; This theme in writing, notes Koprince, &quot;belongs to a tradition of Jewish humor ... a tradition which values laughter as a defense mechanism and which sees humor as a healing, life-giving force.&quot;

=== Critical response ===
During most of his career, Simon&#x27;s work received mixed reviews, with many critics admiring his comedy skills, much of it a blend of &quot;humor and pathos&quot;. Other critics were less complimentary, noting that much of his dramatic structure was weak and sometimes relied too heavily on gags and one-liners. As a result, notes Kopince, &quot;literary scholars had generally ignored Simon&#x27;s early work, regarding him as a commercially successful playwright rather than a serious dramatist.&quot; Clive Barnes, theater critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote that like his British counterpart Noël Coward, Simon was &quot;destined to spend most of his career underestimated&quot;, but nonetheless very &quot;popular&quot;.
This attitude changed after 1991, when he won a Pulitzer Prize for drama with &quot;Lost in Yonkers&quot;. McGovern writes that &quot;seldom has even the most astute critic recognized what depths really exist in the plays of Neil Simon.&quot; When &quot;Lost in Yonkers&quot; was considered by the Pulitzer Advisory Board, board member Douglas Watt noted that it was the only play nominated by all five jury members, and that they judged it &quot;a mature work by an enduring (and often undervalued) American playwright.&quot;

McGovern compares Simon with noted earlier playwrights, including Ben Jonson, Molière, and George Bernard Shaw, pointing out that those playwrights had &quot;successfully raised fundamental and sometimes tragic issues of universal and therefore enduring interest without eschewing the comic mode.&quot; She concludes, &quot;It is my firm conviction that Neil Simon should be considered a member of this company ... an invitation long overdue.&quot; McGovern attempts to explain the response of many critics:
Similarly, literary critic Robert Johnson explains that Simon&#x27;s plays have given us a &quot;rich variety of entertaining, memorable characters&quot; who portray the human experience, often with serious themes. Although his characters are &quot;more lifelike, more complicated and more interesting&quot; than most of the characters audiences see on stage, Simon has &quot;not received as much critical attention as he deserves.&quot; Lawrence Grobel, in fact, calls him &quot;the Shakespeare of his time&quot;, and possibly the &quot;most successful playwright in history.&quot; He states:

Broadway critic Walter Kerr tries to rationalize why Simon&#x27;s work has been underrated:

== Personal life ==
Simon was married five times. For 20 years (1953–73), he was married to Joan Baim, a Martha Graham dancer; they had two daughters. Simon became a widower in 1973 when Baim died of bone cancer at age 41. One daughter, Ellen, wrote a semi-autobiographical play which was subsequently filmed as &quot;Moonlight and Valentino&quot;. Simon married actress Marsha Mason (1973–1983), that same year. After his divorce from Mason, he married actress Diane Lander two separate times (1987–1988 and 1990–1998). He adopted Lander&#x27;s daughter from a previous relationship. His subsequent marriage to actress Elaine Joyce in 1999 lasted until his death.

Simon&#x27;s nephew is U.S. District Judge Michael H. Simon and his niece-in-law is U.S. Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici.

Simon was on the board of selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service.

In 2004, Simon received a kidney transplant from his long-time friend and publicist Bill Evans.

Neil Simon died from pneumonia at New York–Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan on August 26, 2018, while hospitalized for kidney failure. He was 91 and also had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

== Awards and honors ==

Simon held three honorary degrees: a Doctor of Humane Letters from Hofstra University, a Doctor of Letters from Marquette University and a Doctor of Law from Williams College. In 1983 Simon became the only living playwright to have a New York City theatre named after him. The Alvin Theatre on Broadway was renamed the Neil Simon Theatre in his honor, and he was an honorary board of trustees member of the Walnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia, America&#x27;s oldest theatre. Also in 1983, Simon was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

In 1965, he won the Tony Award for Best Playwright (&quot;The Odd Couple&quot;), and in 1975, a special Tony Award for his overall contribution to American theater. Simon won the 1978 Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Screenplay for &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot;. For &quot;Brighton Beach Memoirs&quot; (1983), he was awarded the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award, followed by another Tony Award for Best Play of 1985, &quot;Biloxi Blues&quot;. In 1991, he won the Pulitzer Prize along with the Tony Award for &quot;Lost in Yonkers&quot; (1991).

The Neil Simon Festival is a professional summer repertory theatre devoted to preserving the works of Simon and his contemporaries. The Neil Simon Festival was founded by Richard Dean Bugg in 2003.

In 2006, Simon received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.

<doc id="22050" wikidata="Q181574" url="?curid=22050" title="North American Free Trade Agreement">
<text>The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA ; , TLCAN; , ALÉNA) was an agreement signed by Canada, Mexico, and the United States that created a trilateral trade bloc in North America. The agreement came into force on January 1, 1994, and superseded the 1988 Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement between the United States and Canada. The NAFTA trade bloc formed one of the largest trade blocs in the world by gross domestic product.

The impetus for a North American free trade zone began with U.S. president Ronald Reagan, who made the idea part of his 1980 presidential campaign. After the signing of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement in 1988, the administrations of U.S. president George H. W. Bush, Mexican president Carlos Salinas de Gortari, and Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney agreed to negotiate what became NAFTA. Each submitted the agreement for ratification in their respective capitals in December 1992, but NAFTA faced significant opposition in both the United States and Canada. All three countries ratified NAFTA in 1993 after the addition of two side agreements, the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC) and the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC).

Passage of NAFTA resulted in the elimination or reduction of barriers to trade and investment between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The effects of the agreement regarding issues such as employment, the environment, and economic growth have been the subject of political disputes. Most economic analyses indicated that NAFTA was beneficial to the North American economies and the average citizen, but harmed a small minority of workers in industries exposed to trade competition. Economists held that withdrawing from NAFTA or renegotiating NAFTA in a way that reestablished trade barriers would have adversely affected the U.S. economy and cost jobs. However, Mexico would have been much more severely affected by job loss and reduction of economic growth in both the short term and long term.

After U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, he sought to replace NAFTA with a new agreement, beginning negotiations with Canada and Mexico. In September 2018, the United States, Mexico, and Canada reached an agreement to replace NAFTA with the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA), and all three countries had ratified it by March 2020. NAFTA remained in force until USMCA was implemented. In April 2020, Canada and Mexico notified the U.S. that they were ready to implement the agreement. The USMCA took effect on July 1, 2020, replacing NAFTA.

== Negotiation, signing, ratification, and revision (1988–94)==
===Negotiation===
The impetus for a North American free trade zone began with U.S. president Ronald Reagan, who made the idea part of his campaign when he announced his candidacy for the presidency in November 1979. Canada and the United States signed the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in 1988, and shortly afterward Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari decided to approach U.S. president George H. W. Bush to propose a similar agreement in an effort to bring in foreign investment following the Latin American debt crisis. As the two leaders began negotiating, the Canadian government under Prime Minister Brian Mulroney feared that the advantages Canada had gained through the Canada–US FTA would be undermined by a US–Mexican bilateral agreement, and asked to become a party to the US–Mexican talks.

===Signing===
Following diplomatic negotiations dating back to 1990, the leaders of the three nations signed the agreement in their respective capitals on December 17, 1992. The signed agreement then needed to be ratified by each nation&#x27;s legislative or parliamentary branch.

===Ratification===
====Canada====
The earlier Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement had been controversial and divisive in Canada, and featured as an issue in the 1988 Canadian election. In that election, more Canadians voted for anti-free trade parties (the Liberals and the New Democrats), but the split of the votes between the two parties meant that the pro-free trade Progressive Conservatives (PCs) came out of the election with the most seats and so took power. Mulroney and the PCs had a parliamentary majority and easily passed the 1987 Canada–US FTA and NAFTA bills. However, Mulroney was replaced as Conservative leader and prime minister by Kim Campbell. Campbell led the PC party into the 1993 election where they were decimated by the Liberal Party under Jean Chrétien, who campaigned on a promise to renegotiate or abrogate NAFTA. Chrétien subsequently negotiated two supplemental agreements with Bush, who had subverted the LAC advisory process and worked to &quot;fast track&quot; the signing prior to the end of his term, ran out of time and had to pass the required ratification and signing of the implementation law to incoming president Bill Clinton.

====United States====
Before sending it to the United States Senate, Clinton added two side agreements, the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC) and the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC), to protect workers and the environment, and to also allay the concerns of many House members. The U.S. required its partners to adhere to environmental practices and regulations similar to its own. After much consideration and emotional discussion, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act on November 17, 1993, 234–200. The agreement&#x27;s supporters included 132 Republicans and 102 Democrats. The bill passed the Senate on November 20, 1993, 61–38. Senate supporters were 34 Republicans and 27 Democrats. Republican Representative David Dreier of California, a strong proponent of NAFTA since the Reagan administration, played a leading role in mobilizing support for the agreement among Republicans in Congress and across the country.

Chicago Congressman Luis Gutiérrez in particular was a vocal opponent of NAFTA, ultimately voting against the measure because of what he considered its failure to sufficiently provide for displaced worker retraining, protections against American job loss, and protections of collective bargaining rights for Mexican workers. He criticized the role of Rahm Emanuel in particular for the deficiencies.

The U.S. required its partners to adhere to environmental practices and regulations similar to its own.

Clinton signed it into law on December 8, 1993; the agreement went into effect on January 1, 1994. At the signing ceremony, Clinton recognized four individuals for their efforts in accomplishing the historic trade deal: Vice President Al Gore, Chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers Laura Tyson, Director of the National Economic Council Robert Rubin, and Republican Congressman David Dreier. Clinton also stated that &quot;NAFTA means jobs. American jobs, and good-paying American jobs. If I didn&#x27;t believe that, I wouldn&#x27;t support this agreement.&quot; NAFTA replaced the previous Canada-US FTA.

====Mexico====
NAFTA (TLCAN in Spanish) was approved by the Mexican Senate on November 22, 1993, and was published in the Official Gazette of the Federation on December 8, 1993.

The decree implementing NAFTA and the various changes to accommodate NAFTA in Mexican law was promulgated on December 14, 1993, with entry into force on January 1, 1994.

== Provisions ==
The goal of NAFTA was to eliminate barriers to trade and investment between the United States, Canada and Mexico. The implementation of NAFTA on January 1, 1994, brought the immediate elimination of tariffs on more than one-half of Mexico&#x27;s exports to the U.S. and more than one-third of U.S. exports to Mexico. Within 10 years of the implementation of the agreement, all U.S.–Mexico tariffs were to be eliminated except for some U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico, to be phased out within 15 years. Most U.S.–Canada trade was already duty-free. NAFTA also sought to eliminate non-tariff trade barriers and to protect the intellectual property rights on traded products.

Chapter 20 provided a procedure for the international resolution of disputes over the application and interpretation of NAFTA. It was modeled after Chapter 69 of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement.

NAFTA is, in part, implemented by Technical Working Groups composed of government officials from each of the three partner nations.

=== Intellectual property ===
The North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act made some changes to the copyright law of the United States, foreshadowing the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994 by restoring copyright (within the NAFTA nations) on certain motion pictures which had entered the public domain.

=== Environment ===
The Clinton administration negotiated a side agreement on the environment with Canada and Mexico, the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC), which led to the creation of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) in 1994. To alleviate concerns that NAFTA, the first regional trade agreement between a developing country and two developed countries, would have negative environmental impacts, the commission was mandated to conduct ongoing &quot;ex post&quot; environmental assessment, It created one of the first &quot;ex post&quot; frameworks for environmental assessment of trade liberalization, designed to produce a body of evidence with respect to the initial hypotheses about NAFTA and the environment, such as the concern that NAFTA would create a &quot;race to the bottom&quot; in environmental regulation among the three countries, or that NAFTA would pressure governments to increase their environmental protections. The CEC has held four symposia to evaluate the environmental impacts of NAFTA and commissioned 47 papers on the subject from leading independent experts.

===Labor===
Proponents of NAFTA in the United States emphasized that the pact was a free-trade, not an economic-community, agreement. The freedom of movement it establishes for goods, services and capital did not extend to labor. In proposing what no other comparable agreement had attempted—to open industrialized countries to &quot;a major Third World country&quot;—NAFTA eschewed the creation of common social and employment policies. The regulation of the labor market and or the workplace remained the exclusive preserve of the national governments.

A &quot;side agreement&quot; on enforcement of existing domestic labor law, concluded in August 1993, the North American Agreement on Labour Cooperation (NAALC), was highly circumscribed. Focused on health and safety standards and on child labor law, it excluded issues of collective bargaining, and its &quot;so-called [enforcement] teeth&quot; were accessible only at the end of &quot;a long and tortuous&quot; disputes process&quot;. Commitments to enforce existing labor law also raised issues of democratic practice. The Canadian anti-NAFTA coalition, Pro-Canada Network, suggested that guarantees of minimum standards would be &quot;meaningless&quot; without &quot;broad democratic reforms in the [Mexican] courts, the unions, and the government&quot;. Later assessment, however, did suggest that NAALC&#x27;s principles and complaint mechanisms did &quot;create new space for advocates to build coalitions and take concrete action to articulate challenges to the status quo and advance workers’ interests&quot;.

=== Agriculture ===
From the earliest negotiation, agriculture was a controversial topic within NAFTA, as it has been with almost all free trade agreements signed within the WTO framework. Agriculture was the only section that was not negotiated trilaterally; instead, three separate agreements were signed between each pair of parties. The Canada–U.S. agreement contained significant restrictions and tariff quotas on agricultural products (mainly sugar, dairy, and poultry products), whereas the Mexico–U.S. pact allowed for a wider liberalization within a framework of phase-out periods (it was the first North–South FTA on agriculture to be signed).

=== Transportation infrastructure ===
NAFTA established the CANAMEX Corridor for road transport between Canada and Mexico, also proposed for use by rail, pipeline, and fiber optic telecommunications infrastructure. This became a High Priority Corridor under the U.S. Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991.

=== Chapter 11 – investor-state dispute settlement procedures===
Another contentious issue was the investor-state dispute settlement obligations contained in Chapter 11 of NAFTA. Chapter 11 allowed corporations or individuals to sue Mexico, Canada or the United States for compensation when actions taken by those governments (or by those for whom they are responsible at international law, such as provincial, state, or municipal governments) violated international law.

This chapter has been criticized by groups in the United States, Mexico, and Canada for a variety of reasons, including not taking into account important social and environmental considerations. In Canada, several groups, including the Council of Canadians, challenged the constitutionality of Chapter 11. They lost at the trial level and the subsequent appeal.

Methanex Corporation, a Canadian corporation, filed a US$970 million suit against the United States. Methanex claimed that a California ban on methyl &quot;tert&quot;-butyl ether (MTBE), a substance that had found its way into many wells in the state, was hurtful to the corporation&#x27;s sales of methanol. The claim was rejected, and the company was ordered to pay US$3 million to the U.S. government in costs, based on the following reasoning: &quot;But as a matter of general international law, a non-discriminatory regulation for a public purpose, which is enacted in accordance with due process and, which affects, inter alios, a foreign investor or investment is not deemed expropriatory and compensable unless specific commitments had been given by the regulating government to the then putative foreign investor contemplating investment that the government would refrain from such regulation.&quot;

In another case, Metalclad, an American corporation, was awarded US$15.6 million from Mexico after a Mexican municipality refused a construction permit for the hazardous waste landfill it intended to construct in Guadalcázar, San Luis Potosí. The construction had already been approved by the federal government with various environmental requirements imposed (see paragraph 48 of the tribunal decision). The NAFTA panel found that the municipality did not have the authority to ban construction on the basis of its environmental concerns.

In Eli Lilly and Company v. Government of Canada the plaintiff presented a US$500 million claim for the way Canada requires usefulness in its drug patent legislation. Apotex sued the U.S. for US$520 million because of opportunity it says it lost in an FDA generic drug decision.

Lone Pine Resources Inc. v. Government of Canada filed a US$250 million claim against Canada, accusing it of &quot;arbitrary, capricious and illegal&quot; behaviour, because Quebec intends to prevent fracking exploration under the St. Lawrence Seaway.

Lone Pine Resources is incorporated in Delaware but headquartered in Calgary, and had an initial public offering on the NYSE May 25, 2011, of 15 million shares each for $13, which raised US$195 million.

Barutciski acknowledged &quot;that NAFTA and other investor-protection treaties create an anomaly in that Canadian companies that have also seen their permits rescinded by the very same Quebec legislation, which expressly forbids the paying of compensation, do not have the right (to) pursue a NAFTA claim&quot;, and that winning &quot;compensation in Canadian courts for domestic companies in this case would be more difficult since the Constitution puts property rights in provincial hands&quot;.

A treaty with China would extend similar rights to Chinese investors, including SOEs.

=== Chapter 19 – countervailing duty ===
NAFTA&#x27;s Chapter 19 was a trade dispute mechanism which subjects antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) determinations to binational panel review instead of, or in addition to, conventional judicial review. For example, in the United States, review of agency decisions imposing antidumping and countervailing duties are normally heard before the U.S. Court of International Trade, an Article III court. NAFTA parties, however, had the option of appealing the decisions to binational panels composed of five citizens from the two relevant NAFTA countries. The panelists were generally lawyers experienced in international trade law. Since NAFTA did not include substantive provisions concerning AD/CVD, the panel was charged with determining whether final agency determinations involving AD/CVD conformed with the country&#x27;s domestic law. Chapter 19 was an anomaly in international dispute settlement since it did not apply international law, but required a panel composed of individuals from many countries to re-examine the application of one country&#x27;s domestic law.

A Chapter 19 panel was expected to examine whether the agency&#x27;s determination was supported by &quot;substantial evidence&quot;. This standard assumed significant deference to the domestic agency. Some of the most controversial trade disputes in recent years, such as the U.S.–Canada softwood lumber dispute, have been litigated before Chapter 19 panels.

Decisions by Chapter 19 panels could be challenged before a NAFTA extraordinary challenge committee. However, an extraordinary challenge committee did not function as an ordinary appeal. Under NAFTA, it only vacated or remanded a decision if the decision involved a significant and material error that threatens the integrity of the NAFTA dispute settlement system. Since January 2006, no NAFTA party had successfully challenged a Chapter 19 panel&#x27;s decision before an extraordinary challenge committee.

==Adjudication==
The roster of NAFTA adjudicators included many retired judges, such as Alice Desjardins, John Maxwell Evans, Constance Hunt, John Richard, Arlin Adams, Susan Getzendanner, George C. Pratt, Charles B. Renfrew and Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor.

== Impact ==
=== Canada ===
====Historical context====
In 2008, Canadian exports to the United States and Mexico were at $381.3 billion, with imports at $245.1 billion. According to a 2004 article by University of Toronto economist Daniel Trefler, NAFTA produced a significant net benefit to Canada in 2003, with long-term productivity increasing by up to 15 percent in industries that experienced the deepest tariff cuts. While the contraction of low-productivity plants reduced employment (up to 12 percent of existing positions), these job losses lasted less than a decade; overall, unemployment in Canada has fallen since the passage of the act. Commenting on this trade-off, Trefler said that the critical question in trade policy is to understand &quot;how freer trade can be implemented in an industrialized economy in a way that recognizes both the long-run gains and the short-term adjustment costs borne by workers and others&quot;.

A study in 2007 found that NAFTA had &quot;a substantial impact on international trade volumes, but a modest effect on prices and welfare&quot;.

According to a 2012 study, with reduced NAFTA trade tariffs, trade with the United States and Mexico only increased by a modest 11% in Canada compared to an increase of 41% for the U.S. and 118% for Mexico. Moreover, the U.S. and Mexico benefited more from the tariff reductions component, with welfare increases of 0.08% and 1.31%, respectively, with Canada experiencing a decrease of 0.06%.

====Current issues====
According to a 2017 report by the New York City based public policy think tank report, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), bilateral trade in agricultural products tripled in size from 1994 to 2017 and is considered to be one of the largest economic effects of NAFTA on U.S.-Canada trade with Canada becoming the U.S. agricultural sectors&#x27; leading importer. Canadian fears of losing manufacturing jobs to the United States did not materialize with manufacturing employment holding &quot;steady&quot;. However, with Canada&#x27;s labour productivity levels at 72% of U.S. levels, the hopes of closing the &quot;productivity gap&quot; between the two countries were also not realized.

According to a 2018 Sierra Club report, Canada&#x27;s commitments under NAFTA and the Paris agreement conflicted. The Paris commitments were voluntary, and NAFTA&#x27;s were compulsory.

According to a 2018 report by Gordon Laxter published by the Council of Canadians, NAFTA&#x27;s Article 605, energy proportionality rule ensures that Americans had &quot;virtually unlimited first access to most of Canada&#x27;s oil and natural gas&quot; and Canada could not reduce oil, natural gas and electricity exports (74% its oil and 52% its natural gas) to the U.S., even if Canada was experiencing shortages. These provisions that seemed logical when NAFTA was signed in 1993 are no longer appropriate. The Council of Canadians promoted environmental protection and was against NAFTA&#x27;s role in encouraging development of the tar sands and fracking.

US President Donald Trump, angered by Canada&#x27;s dairy tax of &quot;almost 300%&quot;, threatened to leave Canada out of the NAFTA. Since 1972, Canada has been operating on a &quot;supply management&quot; system, which the United States is attempting to pressure it out of, specifically focusing on the dairy industry. However, this has not yet taken place, as Quebec, which holds approximately half the country&#x27;s dairy farms, still supports supply management.

=== Mexico ===
Maquiladoras (Mexican assembly plants that take in imported components and produce goods for export) became the landmark of trade in Mexico. They moved to Mexico from the United States, hence the debate over the loss of American jobs. Income in the maquiladora sector had increased 15.5% since the implementation of NAFTA in 1994. Other sectors also benefited from the free trade agreement, and the share of exports to the U.S. from non-border states increased in the last five years while the share of exports from border states decreased. This allowed for rapid growth in non-border metropolitan areas such as Toluca, León, and Puebla, which were all larger in population than Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez, and Reynosa.

The overall effect of the Mexico–U.S. agricultural agreement is disputed. Mexico did not invest in the infrastructure necessary for competition, such as efficient railroads and highways. This resulted in more difficult living conditions for the country&#x27;s poor. Mexico&#x27;s agricultural exports increased 9.4 percent annually between 1994 and 2001, while imports increased by only 6.9 percent a year during the same period.

One of the most affected agricultural sectors was the meat industry. Mexico went from a small player in the pre-1994 U.S. export market to the second largest importer of U.S. agricultural products in 2004, and NAFTA may have been a major catalyst for this change. Free trade removed the hurdles that impeded business between the two countries, so Mexico provided a growing market for meat for the U.S., and increased sales and profits for the U.S. meat industry. A coinciding noticeable increase in the Mexican per capita GDP greatly changed meat consumption patterns as per capita meat consumption grew.

One of concerns raised by the implementation of NAFTA in Mexico was wealth inequality. National Bureau of Economic Research found that NAFTA increased the wage gap between the lowest and highest earners, directly affecting wealth inequality. According to Global Trade Watch, under NAFTA Mexico observed a decline in real average annual wages, with this decline mainly affecting those who earned the least - the real average wage of minimum wage workers decreased by 14 percent. GTW concluded that &quot;inflation-adjusted wages for virtually every category of Mexican worker decreased over NAFTA’s first six years, even as hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs were being shifted from the United States to Mexico&quot;. Similar effects were found in a study published in the International Journal of Economic Sciences, which found that NAFTA had a direct impact on wage inequality in Mexico; from 1994 onwards, the wage gap between the poorest and the richest workers noticeably increased.

Production of corn in Mexico increased since NAFTA. However, internal demand for corn had increased beyond Mexico&#x27;s supply to the point where imports became necessary, far beyond the quotas Mexico originally negotiated. Zahniser &amp; Coyle pointed out that corn prices in Mexico, adjusted for international prices, have drastically decreased, but through a program of subsidies expanded by former president Vicente Fox, production remained stable since 2000. Reducing agricultural subsidies, especially corn subsidies, was suggested as a way to reduce harm to Mexican farmers.

A 2001 &quot;Journal of Economic Perspectives&quot; review of the existing literature found that NAFTA was a net benefit to Mexico. By 2003, 80% of the commerce in Mexico was executed only with the U.S. The commercial sales surplus, combined with the deficit with the rest of the world, created a dependency in Mexico&#x27;s exports. These effects were evident in the 2001 recession, which resulted in either a low rate or a negative rate in Mexico&#x27;s exports.

A 2015 study found that Mexico&#x27;s welfare increased by 1.31% as a result of the NAFTA tariff reductions and that Mexico&#x27;s intra-bloc trade increased by 118%. Inequality and poverty fell in the most globalization-affected regions of Mexico. 2013 and 2015 studies showed that Mexican small farmers benefited more from NAFTA than large-scale farmers.

NAFTA had also been credited with the rise of the Mexican middle class. A Tufts University study found that NAFTA lowered the average cost of basic necessities in Mexico by up to 50%. This price reduction increased cash-on-hand for many Mexican families, allowing Mexico to graduate more engineers than Germany each year.

Growth in new sales orders indicated an increase in demand for manufactured products, which resulted in expansion of production and a higher employment rate to satisfy the increment in the demand. The growth in the maquiladora industry and in the manufacturing industry was of 4.7% in August 2016. Three quarters of the imports and exports are with the U.S.

Tufts University political scientist Daniel W. Drezner argued that NAFTA made it easier for Mexico to transform to a real democracy and become a country that views itself as North American. This has boosted cooperation between the United States and Mexico.

=== United States ===
Economists generally agreed that the United States economy benefited overall from NAFTA as it increased trade. In a 2012 survey of the Initiative on Global Markets&#x27; Economic Experts Panel, 95% of the participants said that, on average, U.S. citizens benefited from NAFTA while none said that NAFTA hurt US citizens, on average. A 2001 &quot;Journal of Economic Perspectives&quot; review found that NAFTA was a net benefit to the United States. A 2015 study found that US welfare increased by 0.08% as a result of NAFTA tariff reductions, and that US intra-bloc trade increased by 41%.

A 2014 study on the effects of NAFTA on US trade jobs and investment found that between 1993 and 2013, the US trade deficit with Mexico and Canada increased from $17.0 to $177.2 billion, displacing 851,700 US jobs.

In 2015, the Congressional Research Service concluded that the &quot;net overall effect of NAFTA on the US economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of US GDP. However, there were worker and firm adjustment costs as the three countries adjusted to more open trade and investment among their economies.&quot; The report also estimated that NAFTA added $80 billion to the US economy since its implementation, equivalent to a 0.5% increase in US GDP.

The US Chamber of Commerce credited NAFTA with increasing U.S. trade in goods and services with Canada and Mexico from $337 billion in 1993 to $1.2 trillion in 2011, while the AFL–CIO blamed the agreement for sending 700,000 American manufacturing jobs to Mexico over that time.

University of California, San Diego economics professor Gordon Hanson said that NAFTA helped the US compete against China and therefore saved US jobs. While some jobs were lost to Mexico as a result of NAFTA, considerably more would have been lost to China if not for NAFTA.

==== Trade balances ====
The US had a trade surplus with NAFTA countries of $28.3 billion for services in 2009 and a trade deficit of $94.6 billion (36.4% annual increase) for goods in 2010. This trade deficit accounted for 26.8% of all US goods trade deficit. A 2018 study of global trade published by the Center for International Relations identified irregularities in the patterns of trade of NAFTA ecosystem using network theory analytical techniques. The study showed that the US trade balance was influenced by tax avoidance opportunities provided in Ireland.

A study published in the August 2008 issue of the &quot;American Journal of Agricultural Economics&quot;, found NAFTA increased US agricultural exports to Mexico and Canada, even though most of the increase occurred a decade after its ratification. The study focused on the effects that gradual &quot;phase-in&quot; periods in regional trade agreements, including NAFTA, have on trade flows. Most of the increases in members&#x27; agricultural trade, which was only recently brought under the purview of the World Trade Organization, was due to very high trade barriers before NAFTA or other regional trade agreements.

==== Investment ====
The U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in NAFTA countries (stock) was $327.5 billion in 2009 (latest data available), up 8.8% from 2008. The US direct investment in NAFTA countries was in non-bank holding companies and the manufacturing, finance/insurance, and mining sectors. The foreign direct investment of Canada and Mexico in the United States (stock) was $237.2 billion in 2009 (the latest data available), up 16.5% from 2008.

=== Economy and jobs ===
In their May 24, 2017 report, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) wrote that the economic impacts of NAFTA on the U.S. economy were modest. In a 2015 report, the Congressional Research Service summarized multiple studies as follows: &quot;In reality, NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters. The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP. However, there were worker and firm adjustment costs as the three countries adjusted to more open trade and investment among their economies.&quot;

Many American small businesses depended on exporting their products to Canada or Mexico under NAFTA. According to the U.S. Trade Representative, this trade supported over 140,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in the US.

According to University of California, Berkeley professor of economics Brad DeLong, NAFTA had an insignificant impact on US manufacturing. The adverse impact on manufacturing was exaggerated in US political discourse according to DeLong and Harvard economist Dani Rodrik.

According to a 2013 article by Jeff Faux published by the Economic Policy Institute, California, Texas, Michigan and other states with high concentrations of manufacturing jobs were most affected by job loss due to NAFTA. According to a 2011 article by EPI economist Robert Scott, about 682,900 U.S. jobs were &quot;lost or displaced&quot; as a result of the trade agreement. More recent studies agreed with reports by the Congressional Research Service that NAFTA only had a modest impact on manufacturing employment and automation explained 87% of the losses in manufacturing jobs.

=== Environment ===

According to a study in the &quot;Journal of International Economics&quot;, NAFTA reduced pollution emitted by the US manufacturing sector: &quot;On average, nearly two-thirds of the reductions in coarse particulate matter (PM10) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from the U.S. manufacturing sector between 1994 and 1998 can be attributed to trade liberalization following NAFTA.&quot;

According to the Sierra Club, NAFTA contributed to large-scale, export-oriented farming, which led to the increased use of fossil fuels, pesticides and GMO. NAFTA also contributed to environmentally destructive mining practices in Mexico. It prevented Canada from effectively regulating its tar sands industry, and created new legal avenues for transnational corporations to fight environmental legislation. In some cases, environmental policy was neglected in the wake of trade liberalization; in other cases, NAFTA&#x27;s measures for investment protection, such as Chapter 11, and measures against non-tariff trade barriers threatened to discourage more vigorous environmental policy. The most serious overall increases in pollution due to NAFTA were found in the base metals sector, the Mexican petroleum sector, and the transportation equipment sector in the United States and Mexico, but not in Canada.

=== Mobility of persons ===
According to the Department of Homeland Security Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, during fiscal year 2006 (October 2005 – September 2006), 73,880 foreign professionals (64,633 Canadians and 9,247 Mexicans) were admitted into the United States for temporary employment under NAFTA (i.e., in the TN status). Additionally, 17,321 of their family members (13,136 Canadians, 2,904 Mexicans, as well as a number of third-country nationals married to Canadians and Mexicans) entered the U.S. in the treaty national&#x27;s dependent (TD) status. Because DHS counts the number of the new I-94 arrival records filled at the border, and the TN-1 admission is valid for three years, the number of non-immigrants in TN status present in the U.S. at the end of the fiscal year is approximately equal to the number of admissions during the year. (A discrepancy may be caused by some TN entrants leaving the country or changing status before their three-year admission period has expired, while other immigrants admitted earlier may change their status &quot;to&quot; TN or TD, or extend TN status granted earlier).

According to the International Organization for Migration, deaths of migrants have been on the rise worldwide with 5,604 deaths in 2016. An increased number of undocumented farmworkers in California may be due to the initial passing of NAFTA.

Canadian authorities estimated that on December 1, 2006, 24,830 U.S. citizens and 15,219 Mexican citizens were in Canada as &quot;foreign workers&quot;. These numbers include both entrants under NAFTA and those who entered under other provisions of Canadian immigration law. New entries of foreign workers in 2006 totalled 16,841 U.S. citizens and 13,933 Mexicans.

== Disputes and controversies ==
=== 1992 U.S. presidential candidate Ross Perot ===
In the second 1992 presidential debate, Ross Perot argued:

Perot ultimately lost the election, and the winner, Bill Clinton, supported NAFTA, which went into effect on January 1, 1994.

=== Legal disputes ===
In 1996, the gasoline additive MMT was brought to Canada by Ethyl Corporation, an American company when the Canadian federal government banned imports of the additive. The American company brought a claim under NAFTA Chapter 11 seeking US$201 million, from the Canadian federal government as well as the Canadian provinces under the Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT). They argued that the additive had not been conclusively linked to any health dangers, and that the prohibition was damaging to their company. Following a finding that the ban was a violation of the AIT, the Canadian federal government repealed the ban and settled with the American company for US$13 million. Studies by Health and Welfare Canada (now Health Canada) on the health effects of MMT in fuel found no significant health effects associated with exposure to these exhaust emissions. Other Canadian researchers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency disagreed citing studies that suggested possible nerve damage.

The United States and Canada argued for years over the United States&#x27; 27% duty on Canadian softwood lumber imports. Canada filed many motions to have the duty eliminated and the collected duties returned to Canada. After the United States lost an appeal before a NAFTA panel, spokesperson for U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman responded by saying: &quot;we are, of course, disappointed with the [NAFTA panel&#x27;s] decision, but it will have no impact on the anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders.&quot; On July 21, 2006, the United States Court of International Trade found that imposition of the duties was contrary to U.S. law.

==== Change in income trust taxation not expropriation ====
On October 30, 2007, American citizens Marvin and Elaine Gottlieb filed a Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration under NAFTA, claiming thousands of U.S. investors lost a total of $5 billion in the fall-out from the Conservative Government&#x27;s decision the previous year to change the tax rate on income trusts in the energy sector. On April 29, 2009, a determination was made that this change in tax law was not expropriation.

=== Impact on Mexican farmers ===
Several studies rejected NAFTA responsibility for depressing the incomes of poor corn farmers. The trend existed more than a decade before NAFTA existed. Also, maize production increased after 1994, and there wasn&#x27;t a measurable impact on the price of Mexican corn because of subsidized corn from the United States. The studies agreed that the abolition of U.S. agricultural subsidies would benefit Mexican farmers.

=== Zapatista Uprising in Chiapas, Mexico ===

Preparations for NAFTA included cancellation of Article 27 of Mexico&#x27;s constitution, the cornerstone of Emiliano Zapata&#x27;s revolution in 1910–1919. Under the historic Article 27, indigenous communal landholdings were protected from sale or privatization. However, this barrier to investment was incompatible with NAFTA. Indigenous farmers feared the loss of their remaining land and cheap imports (substitutes) from the US. The Zapatistas labelled NAFTA a &quot;death sentence&quot; to indigenous communities all over Mexico and later declared war on the Mexican state on January 1, 1994, the day NAFTA came into force.

=== Criticism from 2016 U.S. presidential candidates ===
In a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview in September 2015, 2016 presidential candidate Donald Trump called NAFTA &quot;the single worst trade deal ever approved in [the United States]&quot;, and said that if elected, he would &quot;either renegotiate it, or we will break it&quot;. , president of the trade group Consejo Coordinador Empresarial, expressed concern about renegotiation and the willingness to focus on the car industry. A range of trade experts said that pulling out of NAFTA would have a range of unintended consequences for the United States, including reduced access to its biggest export markets, a reduction in economic growth, and higher prices for gasoline, cars, fruits, and vegetables. Members of the private initiative in Mexico noted that to eliminate NAFTA, many laws must be adapted by the U.S. Congress. The move would also eventually result in legal complaints by the World Trade Organization. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; noted that a Congressional Research Service review of academic literature concluded that the &quot;net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP&quot;.

Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, called it &quot;a continuation of other disastrous trade agreements, like NAFTA, CAFTA, and permanent normal trade relations with China&quot;. He believes that free trade agreements have caused a loss of American jobs and depressed American wages. Sanders said that America needs to rebuild its manufacturing base using American factories for well-paying jobs for American labor rather than outsourcing to China and elsewhere.

==Policy of the Trump administration==
=== Renegotiation ===
Shortly after his election, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would begin renegotiating the terms of NAFTA, to resolve trade issues he had campaigned on. The leaders of Canada and Mexico had indicated their willingness to work with the Trump administration. Although vague on the exact terms he sought in a renegotiated NAFTA, Trump threatened to withdraw from it if negotiations failed.

In July 2017, the Trump administration provided a detailed list of changes that it would like to see to NAFTA. The top priority was a reduction in the United States&#x27; trade deficit. The administration also called for the elimination of provisions that allowed Canada and Mexico to appeal duties imposed by the United States and limited the ability of the United States to impose import restrictions on Canada and Mexico.

Being &quot;consistent with the president&#x27;s stance on liking trade barriers, liking protectionism&quot;, Chad P. Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics suggested that the proposed changes would make NAFTA &quot;in many respects less of a free-trade agreement.&quot; Additional concerns expressed by the US Trade Representative over subsidized state-owned enterprises and currency manipulation were not thought to apply to Canada and Mexico, but were intended rather to send a message to countries beyond North America.

John Murphy, vice-president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce declared that a number of the proposals tabled by the United States had &quot;little or no support&quot; from the U.S. business and agriculture community.&quot; Pat Roberts, the senior U.S. senator from Kansas, said it was not clear &quot;who they&#x27;re intended to benefit&quot;, and called for push back against the anti-NAFTA moves as the &quot;issues affect real jobs, real lives and real people&quot;. Kansas is a major agricultural exporter, and farm groups warned that just threatening to leave NAFTA might cause buyers to minimize uncertainty by seeking out non-US sources.

A fourth round of talks included a U.S. demand for a sunset clause that would end the agreement in five years, unless the three countries agreed to keep it in place, a provision U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has said would allow the countries to kill the deal if it was not working. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with the House Ways and Means Committee, since Congress would have to pass legislation rolling back the treaty&#x27;s provisions if Trump tries to withdraw from the pact.

From June to late August 2018, Canada was sidelined as the United States and Mexico held bilateral talks. On 27 August 2018 Mexico and the United States announced they had reached a bilateral understanding on a revamped NAFTA trade deal that included provisions that would boost automobile production in the U.S., a 10-year data protection period against generic drug production on an expanded list of products that benefits pharmaceutical companies, particularly US makers producers of high-cost biologic drugs, a sunset clause—a 16-year expiration date with regular 6-year reviews to possibly renew the agreement for additional 16-year terms, and an increased &quot;de minimis&quot; threshold in which Mexico raised the &quot;de minimis&quot; value to $100 from $50 regarding online duty- and tax-free purchases.

According to an August 30 article in &quot;The Economist&quot;, Mexico agreed to increase the rules of origin threshold which would mean that 75% as opposed to the previous 62.5% of a vehicle&#x27;s components must be made in North America to avoid tariffs. Since car makers currently import less expensive components from Asia, under the revised agreement, consumers would pay more for vehicles. As well, approximately 40 to 45 per cent of vehicle components must be made by workers earning a minimum of US$16 per hour, in contrast to the current US$2.30 an hour that a worker earns on average in a Mexican car manufacturing plant. &quot;The Economist&quot; described this as placing &quot;Mexican carmaking into a straitjacket&quot;.

Trudeau and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland announced that they were willing to join the agreement if it was in Canada&#x27;s interests. Freeland returned from her European diplomatic tour early, cancelling a planned visit to Ukraine, to participate in NAFTA negotiations in Washington, D.C. in late August. According to an August 31 &quot;Canadian Press&quot; published in the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;, key issues under debate included supply management, Chapter 19, pharmaceuticals, cultural exemption, the sunset clause, and &quot;de minimis&quot; thresholds.

Although President Donald Trump warned Canada on September 1 that he would exclude them from a new trade agreement unless Canada submitted to his demands, it is not clear that the Trump administration had the authority to do so without the approval of Congress.

On September 30, 2018, the day of the deadline for the Canada–U.S. negotiations, a preliminary deal between the two countries was reached, thus preserving the trilateral pact when the Trump administration submits the agreement before Congress. The new name for the agreement was the &quot;United States—Mexico—Canada Agreement&quot; (USMCA) and came into effect on July 1, 2020.

=== Impact of withdrawing from NAFTA ===
Following Donald Trump&#x27;s election to the presidency, a range of trade experts said that pulling out of NAFTA as Trump proposed would have a range of unintended consequences for the U.S., including reduced access to the U.S.&#x27;s biggest export markets, a reduction in economic growth, and increased prices for gasoline, cars, fruits, and vegetables. The worst affected sectors would be textiles, agriculture and automobiles.

According to Tufts University political scientist Daniel W. Drezner, the Trump administration&#x27;s desire to return relations with Mexico to the pre-NAFTA era are misguided. Drezner argued that NAFTA made it easier for Mexico to transform to a real democracy and become a country that views itself as North American. If Trump acts on many of the threats that he has made against Mexico, it is not inconceivable that Mexicans would turn to left-wing populist strongmen, as several South American countries have. At the very least, US-Mexico relations would worsen, with adverse implications for cooperation on border security, counterterrorism, drug-war operations, deportations and managing Central American migration.

According to Chad P. Bown (senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics), &quot;a renegotiated NAFTA that would reestablish trade barriers is unlikely to help workers who lost their jobs—regardless of the cause—take advantage of new employment opportunities&quot;.

According to Harvard economist Marc Melitz, &quot;recent research estimates that the repeal of NAFTA would not increase car production in the United States&quot;. Melitz noted that this would cost manufacturing jobs.

== Trans-Pacific Partnership ==

If the original Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) had come into effect, existing agreements such as NAFTA would be reduced to those provisions that do not conflict with the TPP, or that require greater trade liberalization than the TPP. However, only Canada and Mexico would have the prospect of becoming members of the TPP after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in January 2017. In May 2017, the 11 remaining members of the TPP, including Canada and Mexico, agreed to proceed with a revised version of the trade deal without U.S. participation.

== American public opinion on NAFTA ==

The American public was largely divided on its view of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), with a wide partisan gap in beliefs. In a February 2018 Gallup Poll, 48% of Americans said NAFTA was good for the U.S., while 46% said it was bad.

According to a journal from the &quot;Law and Business Review of the Americas (LBRA)&quot;, U.S. public opinion of NAFTA centers around three issues: NAFTA&#x27;s impact on the creation or destruction of American jobs, NAFTA&#x27;s impact on the environment, and NAFTA&#x27;s impact on immigrants entering the U.S.

After President Trump&#x27;s election in 2016, support for NAFTA became very polarized between Republicans and Democrats. Donald Trump expressed negative views of NAFTA, calling it &quot;the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country&quot;. Republican support for NAFTA decreased from 43% support in 2008 to 34% in 2017. Meanwhile, Democratic support for NAFTA increased from 41% support in 2008 to 71% in 2017.

The political gap was especially large in concern to views on free trade with Mexico. As opposed to a favorable view of free trade with Canada, whom 79% of American described as a fair trade partner, only 47% of Americans believed Mexico practices fair trade. The gap widened between Democrats and Republicans: 60% of Democrats believed Mexico is practicing fair trade, while only 28% of Republicans did. This was the highest level from Democrats and the lowest level from Republicans ever recorded by the Chicago Council Survey. Republicans had more negative views of Canada as a fair trade partner than Democrats as well.

NAFTA had strong support from young Americans. In a February 2017 Gallup poll, 73% of Americans aged 18–29 said NAFTA was good for the U.S., showing higher support than any other U.S. age group. It also had slightly stronger support from unemployed Americans than from employed Americans.

<text>National Lampoon was an American humor magazine that ran from 1970 to 1998. The magazine started out as a spinoff from &quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot;.

&quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine reached its height of popularity and critical acclaim during the 1970s, when it had a far-reaching effect on American humor and comedy. The magazine spawned films, radio, live theater, various sound recordings, and print products including books. Many members of the publication&#x27;s creative staff went on to contribute creatively to successful media of all types.

The magazine often featured parody and surrealist content. Its issues often had long and short written pieces, a section of actual news items (dubbed &quot;True Facts&quot;), cartoons, and comic strips. Most issues also included &quot;Foto Funnies&quot; or fumetti, which often featured nudity. The magazine declined during the late 1980s and ceased publication in 1998.

Projects that use the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; (NL) brand name continued to be produced, but under its production company successor, National Lampoon, Inc. The 50th anniversary of the magazine took place in 2020 and, to celebrate, the magazine was issued digitally for the first time by Solaris Entertainment Studio.

== Overview ==
&quot;National Lampoon&quot; writers joyfully targeted every kind of phoniness, and had no specific political stance (even though individual staff members had strong political views). The magazine&#x27;s humor often pushed far beyond the boundaries of what was generally considered appropriate and acceptable. It was especially anarchic, satirically attacking what was considered holy and sacred. As Teddy Wayne described it, &quot;At its peak, the [&quot;National Lampoon&quot;] produced some of the bleakest and most controlled furious humor in American letters.&quot;

Thomas Carney, writing in &quot;New Times&quot;, traced the history and style of the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; and the impact it had on comedy&#x27;s new wave. &quot;The &quot;National Lampoon&quot;&quot;, Carney wrote, &quot;was the first full-blown appearance of non-Jewish humor in years—not anti-Semitic, just non-Jewish. Its roots were W.A.S.P. and Irish Catholic, with a weird strain of Canadian detachment... This was not Jewish street-smart humor as a defense mechanism; this was slash-and-burn stuff that alternated in pitch but moved very much on the offensive. It was always disrespect everything, mostly yourself, a sort of reverse deism.&quot;

P. J. O&#x27;Rourke, editor-in-chief of the magazine in 1978, went even further in his characterization of the magazine&#x27;s humor:

The magazine was a springboard to the cinema of the United States for a generation of comedy writers, directors, and performers. Various alumni went on to create and write for &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot;, &quot;SCTV&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;Night Court&quot;, and various films, including &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;, &quot;Caddyshack&quot;, &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot;, and &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. The characteristic humor of &quot;Spy&quot; magazine, &quot;The Onion&quot;, Judd Apatow, Jon Stewart, and Stephen Colbert were all influenced by &quot;National Lampoon&quot;.

As co-founder Henry Beard described the experience years later: &quot;There was this big door that said, &#x27;Thou shalt not.&#x27; We touched it, and it fell off its hinges.&quot;

==The magazine==
=== Publication history ===
&quot;National Lampoon&quot; was started in 1969 by Harvard graduates and &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; alumni Douglas Kenney, Henry Beard, and Robert Hoffman, when they first licensed the &quot;Lampoon&quot; name for a monthly national publication. While still with &quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot;, in the years 1966 to 1969, Kenney and Beard had published a number of one-shot parodies of &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, and Time magazines; they had also written the popular Tolkien parody book &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot;.

The &quot;National Lampoon&quot;″s first issue, dated April 1970, went on sale on March 19, 1970. Kenney (editor) and Beard (executive editor) oversaw the magazine&#x27;s content, while Hoffman (managing editor) handled legal and business negotiations. After a shaky start, the magazine rapidly grew in popularity. Like &quot;The Harvard Lampoon,&quot; individual issues had themes, including such topics as &quot;The Future&quot;, &quot;Back to School&quot;, &quot;Death&quot;, &quot;Self-Indulgence&quot;, and &quot;Blight&quot;. The sixth issue (September 1970), entitled &quot;Show Biz&quot;, got the company in hot water with The Walt Disney Company after a lawsuit was threatened because of the issue&#x27;s cover, which showed a drawing of Minnie Mouse topless, wearing pasties.

The magazine&#x27;s finest period was from 1971 to 1975 (the point at which Beard, Hoffman, and a number of the original creators departed). The &quot;National Lampoon&quot;″s most successful sales period was 1973–75: Its national circulation peaked at 1,000,096 copies sold of the October 1974 &quot;Pubescence&quot; issue. The 1974 monthly average was 830,000, which was also a peak.

Although the glory days of &quot;National Lampoon&quot; ended in 1975, the magazine remained popular and profitable long after that point. As some of the original creators departed, the magazine saw the emergence of John Hughes and editor-in-chief P.J. O&#x27;Rourke, along with artists and writers such as Gerry Sussman, Ellis Weiner, Tony Hendra, Ted Mann, Peter Kleinman, Chris Cluess, Stu Kreisman, John Weidman, Jeff Greenfield, Bruce McCall, and Rick Meyerowitz.

&quot;National Lampoon&quot; continued to be produced on a monthly schedule throughout the 1970s and the early 1980s, and did well during that time.

A more serious decline set in around the mid-1980s: as described in a &quot;New York Times&quot; profile of the magazine from August 1984, &quot;circulation of the magazine [had] fallen from a high of 638,000 to about 450,000. Publishing revenues were down to $9 million in 1983 from $12.5 million in 1981.&quot; 

In 1985, company CEO Matty Simmons took over as the magazine&#x27;s editor-in-chief. He fired the entire editorial staff, and appointed his two sons, Michael and Andy Simmons, as editors, and Larry &quot;Ratso&quot; Sloman as executive editor. Peter Kleinman returned to the magazine as creative director and editor. That year, each monthly issue was devoted to a single topic, with the first being &quot;A Misguided Tour of New York.&quot; In November 1986, &quot;National Lampoon&quot; moved to a bimonthly schedule, publishing six issues a year instead of every month.

J2 Communications bought the magazine and its properties in 1990. In 1991, an attempt at monthly publication was made; nine issues were produced that year, and cartoonist Drew Friedman come on board as comics editor, introducing the works of Daniel Clowes and Chris Ware to a wider audience.

After this, J2 decided instead to focus on licensing the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; brand, exhibiting very little interest in the actual magazine, only publishing it sporadically and erratically. To retain the rights to the Lampoon name, J2 was contractually obligated to publish only one new issue of the magazine per year, so for the rest of the 1990s the number of issues per year declined precipitously. Only two issues were released in 1992. This was followed by one issue in 1993, five in 1994, and three in 1995. For the last three years of its existence, the magazine was published only once a year. The final issue was published in 1998.

In 2007, in association with Graphic Imaging Technology, Inc., National Lampoon, Inc. released a collection of the entire 246 issues of the magazine in PDF format. The cover of the DVD box featured a remake of the January 1973 &quot;Death&quot; issue, with the caption altered to read &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Buy This DVD-ROM, We&#x27;ll Kill This Dog&quot;. The pages are viewable on both Windows (starting with Windows 2000) and Macintosh (starting with OSX) systems.

===Cover art===
The magazine&#x27;s original art directors were cartoonist Peter Bramley and Bill Skurski, founders of New York&#x27;s Cloud Studio, an alternative-culture outfit known at the time for its eclectic style. Bramley created the &quot;Lampoon&quot; first cover and induced successful cartoonists Arnold Roth and Gahan Wilson to become regular contributors.

Beginning with the eighth issue, the art direction of the magazine was taken over by Michael C. Gross, who directed the look of the magazine until 1974. Gross achieved a unified, sophisticated, and integrated look for the magazine, which greatly enhanced its humorous appeal. A number of the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; most acerbic and humorous covers were designed or overseen by Gross, including:
* Court-martialed Vietnam War mass-murderer William Calley sporting the guileless grin of Alfred E. Neuman, complete with the parody catchphrase &#x27;What, My Lai?&quot; (August 1971)
* The iconic Argentinian revolutionary Che Guevara being splattered with a cream pie (January 1972)
* A dog looking worriedly at the muzzle of a revolver pressed to its head, with what became a famous caption: &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Buy This Magazine, We&#x27;ll Kill This Dog&quot; (January 1973): The cover was conceived by writer Ed Bluestone. Photographer Ronald G. Harris initially had a hard time making the dog&#x27;s plight appear humorous instead of pathetic. The solution was to cock the revolver; the clicking sound caused the dog&#x27;s eyes to shift into the position shown. This was the most famous &quot;Lampoon&quot; cover gag, and it was selected by ASME as the seventh-greatest magazine cover of the last 40 years. This issue is among the most coveted and collectible of all the National Lampoon&#x27;s issues.
* A replica of the starving child from the cover of George Harrison&#x27;s charity album &quot;The Concert for Bangladesh&quot;, rendered in chocolate and with a large bite taken out of its head (July 1974)

Michael Gross and Doug Kenney chose a young designer from &quot;Esquire&quot; named Peter Kleinman to succeed the team of Gross and David Kaestle. During his&quot; Lampoon&quot; tenure, Kleinman was also the art director of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; magazine, published by the same company. The best known of Kleinman&#x27;s &quot;Lampoon&quot; covers were &quot;Stevie Wonder with 3-D Glasses&quot; painted by Sol Korby, a photographed &quot;Nose to The Grindstone&quot; cover depicting a man&#x27;s face being pressed against a spinning grinder wheel for the &quot;Work&quot; issue, the &quot;JFK&#x27;s First 6000 Days&quot; issue featuring a portrait of an old John F. Kennedy, the &quot;Fat Elvis&quot; cover which appeared a year before Elvis Presley died, and many of the Mara McAfee covers done in a classic Norman Rockwell style. Kleinman designed the logos for &quot;Animal House&quot; and &quot;Heavy Metal.&quot; Kleinman left in 1979 to open an ad agency.

He was succeeded by Skip Johnson, the designer responsible for the &quot;Sunday Newspaper Parody&quot; and the &quot;Arab Getting Punched in the Face&quot; cover of the &quot;Revenge&quot; issue. Johnson went on to &quot;The New York Times.&quot; He was followed by Michael Grossman, who changed the logo and style of the magazine.

In 1984, Kleinman returned as creative director and went back to the 1970s logo and style, bringing back many of the artists and writers from the magazine&#x27;s heyday. He left four years later to pursue a career in corporate marketing. At that time, the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine entered a period of precipitous decline.

=== Features ===
====Editorials====
Every regular monthly issue of the magazine had an editorial at the front of the magazine. This often appeared to be straightforward but was always a parody. It was written by whoever was the editor of that particular issue, since that role rotated among the staff; Douglas Kenney had been the main writer of them for the first few issues. Some issues were guest-edited.

====True Facts====
&quot;True Facts&quot; was a section near the front of the magazine that contained true but ridiculous items from real life. Together with the masthead, it was one of the few parts of the magazine that was factual. As was explained in the introduction to the &quot;True Facts&quot; 1981 newsstand special, the &quot;True Facts&quot; column was started in 1972 by Henry Beard, and it was based on a feature called &quot;True Stories&quot; in the British publication &quot;Private Eye&quot;. It was essentially a column of funny news briefs.

P. J. O&#x27;Rourke created the first &quot;True Facts Section&quot; in August 1977. This section included photographs of unintentionally funny signage, extracts from ludicrous newspaper reports, strange headlines, and so on.

In 1981 and for many subsequent years John Bendel was in charge of the &quot;True Facts&quot; section of the magazine. Bendel produced the 1981 newsstand special mentioned above. Several &quot;True Facts&quot; compilation books were published during the 1980s and early 90s, and several all-True-Facts issues of the magazine were published during the 1980s.

In the early 2000s, Steven Brykman edited the &quot;True Facts&quot; section of the National Lampoon website.

====Foto Funnies====
Most issues of the magazine featured one or more &quot;Foto Funny&quot; or fumetti, comic strips that use photographs instead of drawings as illustrations. The characters who appeared in the Lampoon&#x27;s Foto Funnies were usually the male writers, editors, artists, photographers, or contributing editors of the magazine, often cast alongside nude or semi-nude female models. In 1980, a paperback compilation book, &quot;National Lampoon Foto Funnies&quot; which appeared as a part of &quot;National Lampoon Comics&quot;, was published.

====Funny Pages====
The &quot;Funny Pages&quot; was a large section at the back of the magazine that was composed entirely of comic strips of various kinds. These included work from a number of artists who also had pieces published in the main part of the magazine, including Gahan Wilson, Ed Subitzky and Vaughn Bodē, as well as artists whose work was only published in this section. The regular strips included &quot;Dirty Duck&quot; by Bobby London, &quot;Trots and Bonnie&quot; by Shary Flenniken, &quot;The Appletons&quot; and &quot;Timberland Tales&quot; by B. K. Taylor, &quot;Politeness Man&quot; by Ron Barrett, and many other strips. A compilation of Gahan Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Nuts&quot; strip was published in 2011. The &quot;Funny Pages&quot; logo header art, which was positioned above Gahan Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Nuts&quot; in each issue, and showed a comfortable, old-fashioned family reading newspaper-sized funny papers, was drawn by Michael Kaluta.

==Corporate history==
=== Twenty First Century Communications ===
The company that owned and published the magazine was called Twenty First Century Communications, Inc.. At the outset, Gerald L. &quot;Jerry&quot; Taylor was the magazine&#x27;s publisher, followed by William T. Lippe. The business side was controlled by Matty Simmons, who was chairman of the board and CEO of Twenty First Century Communications.

=== 1973–1975 creative and commercial zenith ===
The magazine was considered by many to be at its creative zenith in the period 1973–1975. During this period, the magazine regularly published &quot;special editions&quot; which were sold simultaneously on newsstands. Some of the special editions were &quot;best-of&quot; omnibus collections; others were entirely original. Additional projects included a calendar, a songbook, a collection of transfer designs for T-shirts, and a number of books. From time to time, the magazine advertised Lampoon-related merchandise for sale, including specially-designed T-shirts. The magazine sold yellow binders with the Lampoon logo, designed to store a year&#x27;s worth of issues.

It was also during this time that &quot;National Lampoon: Lemmings&quot; show was staged and &quot;The National Lampoon Radio Hour&quot; was broadcast, bringing interest and acclaim to the National Lampoon brand with magazine talent like writer Michael O&#x27;Donoghue. Comedy stars John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Gilda Radner, Bill Murray, Brian Doyle Murray, Harold Ramis, and Richard Belzer first gained national attention for their performances in those productions.

=== 1975 founders exit ===
In 1975, the three founders Kenney, Beard, and Hoffman left the magazine, taking advantage of a buyout clause in their contracts for a shared total of $7.5 million (although Kenney remained on the magazine&#x27;s masthead as a senior editor until about 1976).

At about the same time, writers Michael O&#x27;Donoghue and Anne Beatts left NL to join &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, as did Chase, Belushi, and Radner, who left the troupe to join the original septet of &quot;SNL&quot;″s Not Ready For Prime Time Players. Bill Murray replaced Chase when Chase left &quot;SNL&quot; after the first season, and Brian Doyle Murray later appeared as an &quot;SNL&quot; regular.

Harold Ramis went on to star in the Canadian sketch show &quot;SCTV&quot; and assumed the role as its head writer, then left after season 1 to be a prolific director, writer, and actor, working on such films as &quot;Animal House&quot;, &quot;Caddyshack&quot;, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; and many more. Brian Doyle Murray has had roles in dozens of films, and Belzer was an Emmy Award-winning TV actor.

=== &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; / HM Communications ===

After a European trip in 1975 by Tony Hendra expressing interest in European comics, NL&#x27;s New York offices attracted significant European comics material. In September 1976 editor Sean Kelly singled out the relatively new French anthology &quot;Métal hurlant&quot; (, though Kelly translated it as &quot;Screaming Metal&quot;) and brought it to the attention of Twenty First Century Communications, Inc. president Leonard Mogel, who was departing for Germany and France to jump-start the French edition of &quot;National Lampoon&quot;. Upon Mogel&#x27;s return from Paris, he reported that the French publishers had agreed to an English-language version.

&quot;Heavy Metal&quot; debuted in the US with an April 1977 issue, as a glossy, full-color monthly published by HM Communications, Inc., a subsidiary of Twenty First Century Communications, Inc. The cover of the initial issue declared itself to be &quot;From the people who bring you the &quot;National Lampoon&quot;&quot;, and the issue primarily featured reprints from &quot;Métal hurlant&quot;, as well as material from &quot;National Lampoon&quot;. Since the color pages from &quot;Métal hurlant&quot; had already been shot in France, the budget to reproduce them in the US version was greatly reduced.

===&quot;Animal House&quot; and shift of focus ===
In 1978, after the huge success of &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;, the company shifted focus from the magazine to NL-produced films. According to Tony Hendra, &quot;...Matty Simmons decided this particular goose could lay larger, better quality gold eggs if it emulated what he saw as &quot;Animal House,&quot; by which he meant adolescent... The significance of the choice that was made in 1978 cannot be underestimated.&quot; In late 1979, now only publishing &quot;National Lampoon&quot; and &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, Twenty First Century Communications, Inc. was renamed National Lampoon, Inc.

From 1982 to 1985, the company produced five more National Lampoon films: &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Class Reunion&quot; (1982), &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Movie Madness&quot; (1982), &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; (1983), &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Joy of Sex&quot; (1984), and &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s European Vacation&quot; (1985).

National Lampoon, Inc. made itself available for sale in late 1986. Upstart video distributor Vestron Inc. attempted a takeover bid in December of that year, but board members rejected the offer. A short time later, the company board &quot;agreed to be acquired by a Los Angeles-based group of private investors in a deal valued at more than $12 million.&quot; The group, calling itself &quot;N.L. Acquisitions Inc.&quot; offered a bid of $7.25 per share (the company stock at that point trading at $6.125 a share). A few days later, &quot;Giggle Acquisition Partnership No. 1,&quot; whose members included actor Bruce Willis, &quot;hinted ... that it might make a hostile bid&quot; for the company. Ultimately, nothing came of these bids, and Simmons remained in control of the board.

In 1989, the company produced &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot;.

=== Grodnik/Matheson takeover===
In 1988–1989, the company was the subject of a hostile takeover. On December 29, 1988, film producer Daniel Grodnik and actor Tim Matheson (who played &quot;Otter&quot; in the magazine&#x27;s first big hit, the 1978 film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;) filed with the SEC that their production company, Grodnick/Matheson Co., had acquired voting control of 21.3 percent of National Lampoon Inc. stock and wanted to gain management control. They were named to the company&#x27;s board in January 1989, and eventually took control of the company by purchasing the ten-percent share of Simmons, who departed the company.

Grodnik and Matheson became the co-chairmen/co-CEOs. During their tenure, the stock went up from under $2 to $6, and the magazine was able to double its monthly ad pages. The company moved its headquarters from New York to Los Angeles to focus on film and television. The publishing operation stayed in New York.

===J2 Communications era===
In 1990, Grodnik and Matheson sold the company (and more importantly, the rights to the brand name &quot;National Lampoon&quot;) to J2 Communications (a company previously known for marketing Tim Conway&#x27;s &quot;Dorf&quot; videos), headed by James P. Jimirro. According to Jimirro, at that point, National Lampoon was &quot;a moribund company that had been losing money since the early 1980s.&quot;
The property was considered valuable only as a brand name that could be licensed out to other companies. The magazine itself was issued erratically and rarely from 1991 onwards; its final print publication was November 1998. (Meanwhile, in May 1992, J2 Communications sold &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; to cartoonist and publisher Kevin Eastman.)

In 1991, J2 Communications began selling film rights to the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; name; it was paid for the use of the brand on such films as &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Loaded Weapon 1&quot; (1993), &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Senior Trip&quot; (1995), &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Golf Punks&quot; (1998), &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Van Wilder&quot; (2002), &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Repli-Kate&quot; (2002), &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Blackball&quot; (2003), and &quot;National Lampoon Presents: Jake&#x27;s Booty Call&quot; (2003). During this period, the company also licensed the Lampoon brand for five made-for-television movies, and one direct-to-video production. Although the licensing deals salvaged the company from bankruptcy, many believe it damaged National Lampoon&#x27;s reputation as a source of respected comedy.

In 1998, the magazine contract was renegotiated and, in a sharp reversal, J2 Communications was then prohibited from publishing future issues. J2, however, still owned the rights to the brand name, which it continued to franchise out to other users.

=== National Lampoon Inc. ===

In 2002, the use of the Lampoon brand name and the rights to republish old material were sold to a group of investors headed by Dan Laikin and Paul Skjodt. They formed a new, and otherwise unrelated, company called National Lampoon, Inc. Jimirro stayed on as CEO, serving until 2005. 

Laikin aimed to revive the brand&#x27;s heyday spirit, engaging original contributors like Matty Simmons and Chris Miller. The company expanded, acquiring Burly Bear Network and initiating original programming. However, financial losses persisted, reaching millions annually. Amid chaotic office scenes, Laikin&#x27;s inclusive hiring fostered camaraderie but struggled to attract top talent. Despite efforts to stabilize and relocate to Hollywood, financial woes persisted. Laikin stepped down in 2008, replaced by investor Tim Durham, who faced scrutiny for lavish spending and questionable tactics. Scandals plagued leadership, including Laikin&#x27;s stock manipulation scheme and Durham&#x27;s Ponzi scheme involvement. Legal battles ensued, culminating in first Laikin and then Durham&#x27;s imprisonment.

In 2012, Alan Donnes took over and revitalized the company, distancing it from controversies.

=== PalmStar Media ===
PalmStar Media acquired National Lampoon in 2017. In 2020, National Lampoon sued its then-president, Evan Shapiro, for fraud, alleging in New York federal court that he owed more than $3 million for surreptitiously funneling the company&#x27;s intellectual property and money from deals with Quibi, Disney+, and Comedy Central Digital into companies he controlled. Shapiro later claimed that National Lampoon Co-CEO Kevin Frakes had bullied him out of a job.

==Related media==
During its most active period, 1971– 1980, the magazine spun off numerous productions in a wide variety of media, including books, special issues, anthologies, and other print pieces:

According to Mark Simonson&#x27;s &quot;Very Large National Lampoon Site&quot;: &quot;If you buy a copy of this issue, you may find the ad is missing. As a result of a lawsuit by VW over the ad for unauthorized use of their trademark, NatLamp was forced to remove the page (with razor blades!) from any copies they still had in inventory (which, from what I gather, was about half the first printing of 250,000 copies) and all subsequent reprints.&quot;

===Films===

Considerable ambiguity exists about what actually constitutes a &quot;National Lampoon&quot; film.

During the 1970s and early 1980s, a few films were made as spin-offs from the original &quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine, using its creative staff. The first theatrical release, and by far the most successful &quot;National Lampoon&quot; film was &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot; (1978). Starring John Belushi and written by Doug Kenney, Harold Ramis, and Chris Miller, it became the highest-grossing comedy film of that time. Produced on a low budget, it was so enormously profitable that, from that point on for the next two decades, the name &quot;National Lampoon&quot; applied to the title of a movie was considered to be a valuable selling point in and of itself.

Numerous movies were subsequently made that had &quot;National Lampoon&quot; as part of the title. Many of these were unrelated projects because, by that time, the name &quot;National Lampoon&quot; could simply be licensed on a one-time basis, by any company, for a fee. Critics such as the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;″s Roger Moore and &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Andrew Adam Newman have written about the cheapening of the &quot;National Lampoon&quot;″s movie imprimatur; in 2006, an Associated Press review said: &quot;The National Lampoon, once a brand name above nearly all others in comedy, has become shorthand for pathetic frat boy humor.&quot; (For the purpose of this article, only films made as spin-offs from the original &quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine, using some of the magazine&#x27;s creative staff to put together the outline and script, and/or were cast using actors from &quot;The National Lampoon Radio Hour&quot; and &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Lemmings&quot; are considered.)

; &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;
In 1978, &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot; was released. Made on a small budget, it did phenomenally well at the box office. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress considered the film &quot;culturally significant&quot; and preserved it in the National Film Registry.

The script had its origins in a series of short stories that had been previously published in the magazine. These included Chris Miller&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Seven Fires&quot;, which dramatized a fraternity initiation and included the characters Pinto and Otter, which contained prose versions of the toga party, the &quot;road trip&quot;, and the dead horse incident. Another source was Doug Kenney&#x27;s &quot;First Lay Comics&quot;, which included the angel and devil scene and the grocery-cart affair. According to the authors, most of these elements were based on real incidents.

The film was of great cultural significance to its time, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; describes the magazine&#x27;s 1970s period as &quot;Hedonism ... in full sway and political correctness in its infancy.&quot; &quot;Animal House&quot;, as the article describes, was a crucial film manifestation of that culture. An article from &quot;The Atlantic&quot; describes how &quot;Animal House&quot; captures the struggle between an &quot;elitist [fraternity] who willingly aligned itself with the establishment, and the kind full of kooks who refused to be tamed.&quot; That concept was a crucial element of the original &quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine, according to a &quot;New York Times&quot; article concerning its early years and co-founder Douglas Kenney&#x27;s brand of comedy as a &quot;liberating response to a rigid and hypocritical culture.&quot;

; &quot;National Lampoon Goes to the Movies&quot;

Also known as &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Movie Madness&quot;, this commercially disappointing collection of three genre parodies was made in 1981, before &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Class Reunion&quot; but released the following year.

; &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Class Reunion&quot;

This 1982 movie was an attempt by John Hughes to make something similar to &quot;Animal House&quot;. &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Class Reunion&quot; was not successful.

; &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot;

Released in 1983, the movie &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; was based upon John Hughes&#x27;s &quot;National Lampoon&quot; story &quot;Vacation &#x27;58&quot;. The movie&#x27;s financial success gave rise to several follow-up films, including &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s European Vacation&quot; (1985), &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot; (1989), based on John Hughes&#x27;s &quot;Christmas &#x27;59&quot;, &quot;Vegas Vacation&quot; (1997), and most recently &quot;Vacation&quot; (2015), all featuring Chevy Chase.

====Similar films====
The Robert Altman film &quot;O.C. and Stiggs&quot; (1987) was based on two characters who had been featured in several written pieces in &quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine, including an issue-long story from October 1982 entitled &quot;The Utterly Monstrous, Mind-Roasting Summer of O.C. and Stiggs.&quot; Completed in 1984, the film was not released until 1987, when it was shown in a small number of theaters and without the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; name. It was not a success.

Following the success of &quot;Animal House&quot;, &quot;MAD&quot; magazine lent its name to a 1980 comedy titled &quot;Up the Academy&quot;. Although two of &quot;Animal House&quot; co-writers were the &quot;Lampoon&quot; Doug Kenney and Chris Miller, &quot;Up The Academy&quot; was strictly a licensing maneuver, with no creative input from &quot;Mad&quot; staff or contributors. It was a critical and commercial failure.

==Film about the magazine==
In 2015, a documentary film was released called &quot;National Lampoon: Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead&quot;. The film featured a great deal of content from the magazine, as well as interviews with staff members and fans, and it explains how the magazine changed the course of humor.

The 2018 film &quot;A Futile and Stupid Gesture&quot;, a biography of co-founder Douglas Kenney, also depicts the magazine&#x27;s early years. The film was described by a 2018 &quot;New York Times&quot; article as a &quot;snapshot of a moment where comedy&#x27;s freshest counter-culture impulse was gleefully crass and willfully offensive.&quot; In the same article, Kenney was said to &quot;spot a comical hollowness and rot in the society he and his peers were trained to join.&quot;

<text>A non-disclosure agreement (NDA), also known as a confidentiality agreement (CA), confidential disclosure agreement (CDA), proprietary information agreement (PIA), or secrecy agreement (SA), is a legal contract or part of a contract between at least two parties that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to. Doctor–patient confidentiality (physician–patient privilege), attorney–client privilege, priest–penitent privilege and bank–client confidentiality agreements are examples of NDAs, which are often not enshrined in a written contract between the parties.

It is a contract through which the parties agree not to disclose any information covered by the agreement. An NDA creates a confidential relationship between the parties, typically to protect any type of confidential and proprietary information or trade secrets. As such, an NDA protects non-public business information. Like all contracts, they cannot be enforced if the contracted activities are illegal. NDAs are commonly signed when two companies, individuals, or other entities (such as partnerships, societies, etc.) are considering doing business and need to understand the processes used in each other&#x27;s business for the purpose of evaluating the potential business relationship. NDAs can be &quot;mutual&quot;, meaning both parties are restricted in their use of the materials provided, or they can restrict the use of material by a single party. An employee can be required to sign an NDA or NDA-like agreement with an employer, protecting trade secrets. In fact, some employment agreements include a clause restricting employees&#x27; use and dissemination of company-owned confidential information. In legal disputes resolved by settlement, the parties often sign a confidentiality agreement relating to the terms of the settlement. Examples of such agreements are The Dolby Trademark Agreement with Dolby Laboratories, the Windows Insider Agreement, and the Halo CFP (Community Feedback Program) with Microsoft.

In some cases, employees who are dismissed following their complaints about unacceptable practices (whistleblowers), or discrimination against and harassment of themselves, may be paid compensation subject to an NDA forbidding them from disclosing the events complained about. Such conditions in an NDA may not be enforceable in law, although they may intimidate the former employee into silence.

A similar concept is expressed in the term &quot;non-disparagement agreement&quot;, which prevents one party from stating anything &#x27;derogatory&#x27; about the other party.

== General types ==
A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) may be classified as unilateral, bilateral, or multilateral:

=== Unilateral ===
A unilateral NDA (sometimes referred to as a one-way NDA) involves two parties where only one party (i.e., the disclosing party) anticipates disclosing certain information to the other party (i.e., the receiving party) and requires that the information be protected from further disclosure for some reason (e.g., maintaining the secrecy necessary to satisfy patent laws or legal protection for trade secrets, limiting disclosure of information prior to issuing a press release for a major announcement, or simply ensuring that a receiving party does not use or disclose information without compensating the disclosing party).

=== Bilateral===
A bilateral NDA (sometimes referred to as a mutual NDA, MNDA, or a two-way NDA) involves two parties where both parties anticipate disclosing information to one another that each intends to protect from further disclosure. This type of NDA is common for businesses considering some kind of joint venture or merger.

When presented with a unilateral NDA, some parties may insist upon a bilateral NDA, even though they anticipate that only one of the parties will disclose information under the NDA. This approach is intended to incentivize the drafter to make the provisions in the NDA more &quot;fair and balanced&quot; by introducing the possibility that a receiving party could later become a disclosing party or vice versa, which is not an entirely uncommon occurrence.

=== Multilateral ===
A multilateral NDA involves three or more parties where at least one of the parties anticipates disclosing information to the other parties and requires that the information be protected from further disclosure. This type of NDA eliminates the need for separate unilateral or bilateral NDAs between only two parties. E.g., a single multiparty NDA entered into by three parties who each intend to disclose information to the other two parties could be used in place of three separate bilateral NDAs between the first and second parties, second and third parties, and third and first parties.

A multilateral NDA can be advantageous because the parties involved review, execute, and implement just one agreement. This advantage can be offset by more complex negotiations that may be required for the parties involved to reach a unanimous consensus on a multilateral agreement.

== Content ==
A NDA can protect any type of information that is not generally known. They may also contain clauses that will protect the person receiving the information so that if they lawfully obtained the information through other sources they would not be obligated to keep the information secret. In other words, the NDA typically only requires the receiving party to maintain information in confidence when that information has been directly supplied by the disclosing party

Some common issues addressed in an NDA include:

* outlining the parties to the agreement;
* whether confidential information must be labeled as confidential
* the definition of what is confidential, i.e. the information to be held confidential. Modern NDAs will typically include a of types of items that are covered, including unpublished patent applications, know-how, schema, financial information, verbal representations, customer lists, vendor lists, business practices/strategies, etc.;
* the disclosure period – information not disclosed during the disclosure period (e.g., one year after the date of the NDA) is not deemed confidential;
* the exclusions from what must be kept confidential. Typically, the restrictions on the disclosure or use of confidential data will be invalid if
** the recipient had prior knowledge of the materials;
** the recipient gained subsequent knowledge of the materials from another source;
** the materials are generally available to the public; or
** the materials are subject to a subpoena
* provisions restricting the transfer of data in violation of laws governing export control and national security;
* the term and conditions (in years) of the confidentiality, i.e. the time period of confidentiality;
* the term (in years) the agreement is binding;
* permission to obtain ex-parte injunctive relief;
* description of the actions that need to be done with the confidential materials upon the agreement ending;
* what/when it can be modified by a court
* the obligations of the recipient regarding the confidential information, typically including some version of obligations:
** to use the information only for enumerated purposes;
** to disclose it only to persons with a need to know the information for those purposes;
** to use appropriate efforts (not less than reasonable efforts) to keep the information secure. Reasonable efforts is often defined as a standard of care relating to confidential information that is no less rigorous than that which the recipient uses to keep its own similar information secure; and
** to ensure that anyone to whom the information is disclosed further abides by obligations restricting use, restricting disclosure, and ensuring security at least as protective as the agreement; and
** destruction or return upon request
* types of permissible disclosure – such as those required by law or court order (many NDAs require the receiving party to give the disclosing party prompt notice of any efforts to obtain such disclosure, and possibly to cooperate with any attempt by the disclosing party to seek judicial protection for the relevant confidential information).
* the law and jurisdiction governing the parties. The parties may choose the exclusive jurisdiction of a court of a country.
* whether or not juries, arbitration allowed
* who owns or has rights over the information

==Law and practice by jurisdiction==
===Australia===
Deeds of confidentiality and fidelity (also referred to as deeds of confidentiality or confidentiality deeds) are commonly used in Australia. These documents generally serve the same purpose as and contain provisions similar to NDAs used elsewhere.

===India===
NDAs are used in India. They have been described as &quot;an increasingly popular way of restricting the loss of R&amp;D knowledge through employee turnover in Indian IT firms&quot;. They are often used by companies from other countries who are outsourcing or offshoring work to companies in India. Companies outsourcing research and development of biopharma to India use them, and Indian companies in pharmaceuticals are &quot;competent&quot; in their use. In the space industry, NDAs &quot;are crucial&quot;. &quot;Non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements ... are ... generally enforceable as long as they are reasonable.&quot; Sometimes NDAs have been anti-competitive and this has led to legal challenges.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;back-to-back agreement&quot; refers to an NDA entered into with a third party who legitimately receives confidential information, putting them under similar non-disclosure obligations as the initial party granted the information. Case law in a 2013 Court of Appeal decision (&quot;Dorchester Project Management v BNP Paribas&quot;) confirmed that a confidentiality agreement will be interpreted as a contract subject to the rules of contractual interpretation which generally apply in English courts.

NDAs are often used as a condition of a financial settlement in an attempt to silence whistleblowing employees from making public the misdeeds of their former employers. There is a law, the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, which allows &quot;protected disclosure&quot; despite the existence of an NDA, although employers sometimes intimidate the former employee into silence despite this.

In some legal cases where the conditions of a confidentiality agreement have been breached, the successful party may choose between damages based on an account of the commercial profits which might have been earned if the agreement had been honoured, or damages based on the price of releasing the other party from its obligations under the agreement.

Commercial entities entering into confidentiality agreements need to ensure that the scope of their agreement does not go beyond what is necessary to protect commercial information. In the case of &quot;Jones v Ricoh&quot;, heard by the High Court in 2010, Jones brought an action against the photocopier Ricoh for breach of their confidentiality agreement when Ricoh submitted a tender for a contract with a third party. Ricoh sought release from its obligations under the agreement via an application for summary judgment, and the court agreed that the relevant wording &quot;went further than could reasonably be required&quot; to protect commercial information. The agreement was held to be in breach of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which prohibits agreements which had the object or effect of distorting competition, and was therefore unenforceable.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, confidentiality agreements or non-disclsure agreements are affected by the Maternity Protection, Employment Equality and Preservation of Certain Records Act 2024. 
The Act amends the Employment Equality Act 1998 by restricting the use of non-disclosure agreements (NDA). 

The 2024 Act renders void any NDA that prohibits an employee from disclosing:

* An allegation that s/he has experienced discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment or victimisation regarding his/her employment or potential employment, or
*Any action taken by an employer or employee in response to the making of such an allegation, including any proceedings taken by the employee.

===United States===
NDAs are very common in the United States, with more than one-third of jobs in America containing an NDA. The United States Congress passed the Speak Out Act in 2022, which prohibits them in regard to sexual harassment and sexual assault, and the bill was signed into law by President Joe Biden on December 7, 2022.

Some states, including California, have special circumstances relating to NDAs and non-compete clauses. California&#x27;s courts and legislature have signalled that they generally value an employee&#x27;s mobility and entrepreneurship more highly than they do protectionist doctrine.

<text>In economics, a network effect (also called network externality or demand-side economies of scale) is the phenomenon by which the value or utility a user derives from a good or service depends on the number of users of compatible products. Network effects are typically positive feedback systems, resulting in users deriving more and more value from a product as more users join the same network. The adoption of a product by an additional user can be broken into two effects: an increase in the value to all other users (&quot;total effect&quot;) and also the enhancement of other non-users&#x27; motivation for using the product (&quot;marginal effect&quot;).

Network effects can be direct or indirect. Direct network effects arise when a given user&#x27;s utility increases with the number of other users of the same product or technology, meaning that adoption of a product by different users is complementary. This effect is separate from effects related to price, such as a benefit to existing users resulting from price decreases as more users join. Direct network effects can be seen with social networking services, including Twitter, Facebook, Airbnb, Uber, and LinkedIn; telecommunications devices like the telephone; and instant messaging services such as MSN, AIM or QQ. Indirect (or cross-group) network effects arise when there are &quot;at least two different customer groups that are interdependent, and the utility of at least one group grows as the other group(s) grow&quot;. For example, hardware may become more valuable to consumers with the growth of compatible software.

Network effects are commonly mistaken for economies of scale, which describe decreasing average production costs in relation to the total volume of units produced. Economies of scale are a common phenomenon in traditional industries such as manufacturing, whereas network effects are most prevalent in new economy industries, particularly information and communication technologies. Network effects are the demand side counterpart of economies of scale, as they function by increasing a customer&#x27;s willingness to pay due rather than decreasing the supplier&#x27;s average cost.

Upon reaching critical mass, a bandwagon effect can result. As the network continues to become more valuable with each new adopter, more people are incentivised to adopt, resulting in a positive feedback loop. Multiple equilibria and a market monopoly are two key potential outcomes in markets that exhibit network effects. Consumer expectations are key in determining which outcomes will result.

==Origins==
Network effects were a central theme in the arguments of Theodore Vail, the first post-patent president of Bell Telephone, in gaining a monopoly on US telephone services. In 1908, when he presented the concept in Bell&#x27;s annual report, there were over 4,000 local and regional telephone exchanges, most of which were eventually merged into the Bell System.

Network effects were popularized by Robert Metcalfe, stated as Metcalfe&#x27;s law. Metcalfe was one of the co-inventors of Ethernet and a co-founder of the company 3Com. In selling the product, Metcalfe argued that customers needed Ethernet cards to grow above a certain critical mass if they were to reap the benefits of their network. According to Metcalfe, the rationale behind the sale of networking cards was that the cost of the network was directly proportional to the number of cards installed, but the value of the network was proportional to the square of the number of users. This was expressed algebraically as having a cost of N, and a value of N2. While the actual numbers behind this proposition were never firm, the concept allowed customers to share access to expensive resources like disk drives and printers, send e-mail, and eventually access the Internet.

The economic theory of the network effect was advanced significantly between 1985 and 1995 by researchers Michael L. Katz, Carl Shapiro, Joseph Farrell, and Garth Saloner. Author, high-tech entrepreneur Rod Beckstrom presented a mathematical model for describing networks that are in a state of positive network effect at BlackHat and Defcon in 2009 and also presented the &quot;inverse network effect&quot; with an economic model for defining it as well. Because of the positive feedback often associated with the network effect, system dynamics can be used as a modelling method to describe the phenomena. Word of mouth and the Bass diffusion model are also potentially applicable. The next major advance occurred between 2000 and 2003 when researchers Geoffrey G Parker, Marshall Van Alstyne, Jean-Charles Rochet and Jean Tirole independently developed the two-sided market literature showing how network externalities that cross distinct groups can lead to free pricing for one of those groups.

=== Evidence and consequences ===
While the diversity of sources is in decline, there is a countervailing force of continually increasing functionality with new services, products and applications — such as music streaming services (Spotify), file sharing programs (Dropbox) and messaging platforms (Messenger, WhatsApp and Snapchat). Another major finding was the dramatic increase in the &quot;infant mortality&quot; rate of websites — with the dominant players in each functional niche - once established guarding their turf more staunchly than ever.

On the other hand, growing network effect does not always bring proportional increase in returns. Whether additional users bring more value depends on the commoditization of supply, the type of incremental user and the nature of substitutes. For example, social networks can hit an inflection point, after which additional users do not bring more value. This could be attributed to the fact that as more people join the network, its users are less willing to share personal content and the site becomes more focused on news and public content.

==Economics==
Network economics refers to business economics that benefit from the network effect. This is when the value of a good or service increases when others buy the same good or service. Examples are website such as EBay, or iVillage where the community comes together and shares thoughts to help the website become a better business organization.

In sustainability, network economics refers to multiple professionals (architects, designers, or related businesses) all working together to develop sustainable products and technologies. The more companies are involved in environmentally friendly production, the easier and cheaper it becomes to produce new sustainable products. For instance, if no one produces sustainable products, it is difficult and expensive to design a sustainable house with custom materials and technology. But due to network economics, the more industries are involved in creating such products, the easier it is to design an environmentally sustainable building.

Another benefit of network economics in a certain field is improvement that results from competition and networking within an industry.

==Adoption and competition==
=== Critical mass ===
In the early phases of a network technology, incentives to adopt the new technology are low. After a certain number of people have adopted the technology, network effects become significant enough that adoption becomes a dominant strategy. This point is called critical mass. At the critical mass point, the value obtained from the good or service is greater than or equal to the price paid for the good or service.

When a product reaches critical mass, network effects will drive subsequent growth until a stable balance is reached. Therefore, a key business concern must then be how to attract users prior to reaching critical mass. Critical quality is closely related to consumer expectations, which will be affected by price and quality of products or services, the company&#x27;s reputation and the growth path of the network. Thus, one way is to rely on extrinsic motivation, such as a payment, a fee waiver, or a request for friends to sign up. A more natural strategy is to build a system that has enough value &quot;without&quot; network effects, at least to early adopters. Then, as the number of users increases, the system becomes even more valuable and is able to attract a wider user base.

===Limits to growth===

Network growth is generally not infinite, and tends to plateau when it reaches market saturation (all customers have already joined) or diminishing returns make acquisition of the last few customers too costly.

Networks can also stop growing or collapse if they do not have enough capacity to handle growth. For example, an overloaded phone network that has so many customers that it becomes congested, leading to busy signals, the inability to get a dial tone, and poor customer support. This creates a risk that customers will defect to a rival network because of the inadequate capacity of the existing system. After this point, each additional user decreases the value obtained by every other user.

Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems are networks designed to distribute load among their user pool. This theoretically allows P2P networks to scale indefinitely. The P2P based telephony service Skype benefits from this effect and its growth is limited primarily by market saturation.

=== Market tipping ===
Network effects give rise to the potential outcome of market tipping, defined as &quot;the tendency of one system to pull away from its rivals in popularity once it has gained an initial edge&quot;. Tipping results in a market in which only one good or service dominates and competition is stifled, and can result in a monopoly. This is because network effects tend to incentivise users to coordinate their adoption of a single product. Therefore, tipping can result in a natural form of market concentration in markets that display network effects. However, the presence of network effects does not necessarily imply that a market will tip; the following additional conditions must be met:

# The utility derived by users from network effects must exceed the utility they derive from differentiation
# Users must have high costs of multihoming (i.e. adopting more than one competing networks)
# Users must have high switching costs

If any of these three conditions are not satisfied, the market may fail to tip and multiple products with significant market shares may coexist. One such example is the U.S. instant messaging market, which remained an oligopoly despite significant network effects. This can be attributed to the low multi-homing and switching costs faced by users.

Market tipping does not imply permanent success in a given market. Competition can be reintroduced into the market due to shocks such as the development of new technologies. Additionally, if the price is raised above customers&#x27; willingness to pay, this may reverse market tipping.

=== Multiple equilibria and expectations ===
Networks effects often result in multiple potential market equilibrium outcomes. The key determinant in which equilibrium will manifest are the expectations of the market participants, which are self-fulfilling. Because users are incentivised to coordinate their adoption, user will tend to adopt the product that they expect to draw the largest number of users. These expectations may be shaped by path dependence, such as a perceived first-mover advantage, which can result in lock-in. The most commonly cited example of path dependence is the QWERTY keyboard, which owes its ubiquity to its establishment of an early lead in the keyboard layout industry and high switching costs, rather than any inherent advantage over competitors. Other key influences of adoption expectations can be reputational (e.g. a firm that has previously produced high quality products may be favoured over a new firm).

Markets with network effects may result in inefficient equilibrium outcomes. With simultaneous adoption, users may fail to coordinate towards a single agreed-upon product, resulting in splintering among different networks, or may coordinate to lock-in to a different product than the one that is best for them.

==Technology lifecycle==

If some existing technology or company whose benefits are largely based on network effects starts to lose market share against a challenger such as a disruptive technology or open standards based competition, the benefits of network effects will reduce for the incumbent, and increase for the challenger. In this model, a tipping point is eventually reached at which the network effects of the challenger dominate those of the former incumbent, and the incumbent is forced into an accelerating decline, whilst the challenger takes over the incumbent&#x27;s former position.

Sony&#x27;s Betamax and Victor Company of Japan (JVC)&#x27;s video home system (VHS) can both be used for video cassette recorders (VCR), but the two technologies are not compatible. Therefore, the VCR that is suitable for one type of cassette cannot fit in another. VHS&#x27;s technology gradually surpassed Betamax in the competition. In the end, Betamax lost its original market share and was replaced by VHS.

==Negative network externalities==

Negative network externalities, in the mathematical sense, are those that have a negative effect compared to normal (positive) network effects. Just as positive network externalities (network effects) cause positive feedback and exponential growth, negative network externalities are also caused by positive feedback resulting in exponential decay. Negative network effect must not be confused with negative feedback. Negative feedback is the forces that pull towards equilibrium and are responsible for stability.

 Therefore, congestion occurs when the efficiency of a network decreases as more people use it, and this reduces the value to people already using it. Traffic congestion that overloads the freeway and network congestion on connections with limited bandwidth both display negative network externalities.

Braess&#x27;s paradox suggests that adding paths through a network can have a negative effect on performance of the network.

==Interoperability==
Interoperability has the effect of making the network bigger and thus increases the external value of the network to consumers. Interoperability achieves this primarily by increasing potential connections and secondarily by attracting new participants to the network. Other benefits of interoperability include reduced uncertainty, reduced lock-in, commoditization and competition based on price.

Interoperability can be achieved through standardization or other cooperation. Companies involved in fostering interoperability face a tension between cooperating with their competitors to grow the potential market for products and competing for market share.

== Compatibility and incompatibility ==
Product compatibility is closely related to network externalities in company&#x27;s competition, which refers to two systems that can be operated together without changing. Compatible products are characterized by better matching with customers, so they can enjoy all the benefits of the network without having to purchase products from the same company. However, not only products of compatibility will intensify competition between companies, this will make users who had purchased products lose their advantages, but also proprietary networks may raise the industry entry standards. Compared to large companies with better reputation or strength, weaker companies or small networks will more inclined to choose compatible products.

Besides, the compatibility of products is conducive to the company&#x27;s increase in market share. For example, the Windows system is famous for its operating compatibility, thereby satisfying consumers&#x27; diversification of other applications. As the supplier of Windows systems, Microsoft benefits from indirect network effects, which cause the growing of the company&#x27;s market share.

Incompatibility is the opposite of compatibility. Because incompatibility of products will aggravate market segmentation and reduce efficiency, and also harm consumer interests and enhance competition. The result of the competition between incompatible networks depends on the complete sequential of adoption and the early preferences of the adopters. Effective competition determines the market share of companies, which is historically important. Since the installed base can directly bring more network profit and increase the consumers&#x27; expectations, which will have a positive impact on the smooth implementation of subsequent network effects.

==Open versus closed standards==

In communication and information technologies, open standards and interfaces are often developed through the participation of multiple companies and are usually perceived to provide mutual benefit. But, in cases in which the relevant communication protocols or interfaces are closed standards, the network effect can give the company controlling those standards monopoly power. The Microsoft corporation is widely seen by computer professionals as maintaining its monopoly through these means. One observed method Microsoft uses to put the network effect to its advantage is called Embrace, extend and extinguish.

Mirabilis is an Israeli start-up which pioneered instant messaging (IM) and was bought by America Online. By giving away their ICQ product for free and preventing interoperability between their client software and other products, they were able to temporarily dominate the market for instant messaging. The IM technology has completed the use from the home to the workplace, because of its faster processing speed and simplified process characteristics. Because of the network effect, new IM users gained much more value by choosing to use the Mirabilis system (and join its large network of users) than they would use a competing system. As was typical for that era, the company never made any attempt to generate profits from its dominant position before selling the company.

== Network effect as a competitive advantage ==
Network effect can significantly influence the competitive landscape of an industry. According to Michael E. Porter, strong network effect might decrease the threat of new entrants, which is one of the five major competitive forces that act on an industry. Persistent barriers to entry into a market may help incumbent companies to fend off competition and keep or increase their market share, while maintaining profitability and return on capital.

These attractive characteristics are one of the reasons that allowed platform companies like Amazon, Google or Facebook to grow rapidly and create shareholder value. On the other hand, network effect can result in high concentration of power in an industry, or even a monopoly. This often leads to increased scrutiny from regulators that try to restore healthy competition, as is often the case with large technology companies.

==Examples==

=== Telephone ===
Network effects are the incremental benefit gained by each user for each new user that joins a network. An example of a direct network effect is the telephone. Originally when only a small number of people owned a telephone the value it provided was minimal. Not only did other people need to own a telephone for it to be useful, but it also had to be connected to the network through the users home. As technology advanced it became more affordable for people to own a telephone. This created more value and utility due to the increase in users. Eventually increased usage through exponential growth led to the telephone is used by almost every household adding more value to the network for all users. Without the network effect and technological advances the telephone would have nowhere near the amount of value or utility as it does today.

===Financial exchanges===
Transactions in the financial field may feature a network effect. As the number of sellers and buyers in the exchange, who have the symmetric information increases, liquidity increases, and transaction costs decrease. This then attracts a larger number of buyers and sellers to the exchange.

The network advantage of financial exchanges is apparent in the difficulty that startup exchanges have in dislodging a dominant exchange. For example, the Chicago Board of Trade has retained overwhelming dominance of trading in US Treasury bond futures despite the startup of Eurex US trading of identical futures contracts. Similarly, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has maintained dominance in trading of Eurobond interest rate futures despite a challenge from Euronext.Liffe.

=== Cryptocurrencies and blockchains ===
Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and smart contract blockchains such as Ethereum also exhibit network effects.

Bitcoin&#x27;s unique properties make it an attractive asset to users and investors. The more users that join the network, the more valuable the asset becomes and the more secure the network becomes. This method creates incentive for users to join so that when the network and community grows, a network effect occurs, making it more likely that new people will also join. Bitcoin provides its users with financial value through the network effect which may lead to more investors due to the appeal of financial gain. This is an example of an indirect network effect as the value only increases due to the initial network being created.

Smart contract blockchains can produce network effects through the social network of individuals that uses a blockchain for securing its transactions. Public infrastructure networks such as Ethereum and others can facilitate entities that do not explicitly trust one another to collaborate in meaningful way, incentivizing growth in the network. However, as of 2019, such networks grow more slowly due to missing particular requirements such as privacy and scalability.

===Software===
The widely used computer software benefits from powerful network effects. The software-purchase characteristic is that it is easily influenced by the opinions of others, so the customer base of the software is the key to realizing a positive network effect. Although customers&#x27; motivation for choosing software is related to the product itself, media interaction and word-of-mouth recommendations from purchased customers can still increase the possibility of software being applied to other customers who have not purchased it, thereby resulting in network effects.

In 2007 Apple released the iPhone followed by the app store. Most iPhone apps rely heavily on the existence of strong network effects. This enables the software to grow in popularity very quickly and spread to a large userbase with very limited marketing needed. The Freemium business model has evolved to take advantage of these network effects by releasing a free version that will not limit the adoption or any users and then charge for premium features as the primary source of revenue. Furthermore, some software companies will launch free trial versions during the trial period to attract buyers and reduce their uncertainty. The duration of free time is related to the network effect. The more positive feedback the company received, the shorter the free trial time will be.

Software companies (for example Adobe or Autodesk) often give significant discounts to students. By doing so, they intentionally stimulate the network effect - as more students learn to use a particular piece of software, it becomes more viable for companies and employers to use it as well. And the more employers require a given skill, the higher the benefit that employees will receive from learning it. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle, further strengthening the network effect.

===Web sites===
Many web sites benefit from a network effect. One example is web marketplaces and exchanges. For example, eBay would not be a particularly useful site if auctions were not competitive. As the number of users grows on eBay, auctions grow more competitive, pushing up the prices of bids on items. This makes it more worthwhile to sell on eBay and brings more sellers onto eBay, which, in turn, drives prices down again due to increased supply. Increased supply brings even more buyers to eBay. Essentially, as the number of users of eBay grows, prices fall and supply increases, and more and more people find the site to be useful.

Network effects were used as justification in business models by some of the dot-com companies in the late 1990s. These firms operated under the belief that when a new market comes into being which contains strong network effects, firms should care more about growing their market share than about becoming profitable. The justification was that market share would determine which firm could set technical and marketing standards and giving these companies a first-mover advantage.

Social networking websites are good examples. The more people register onto a social networking website, the more useful the website is to its registrants.

Google uses the network effect in its advertising business with its Google AdSense service. AdSense places ads on many small sites, such as blogs, using Google technology to determine which ads are relevant to which blogs. Thus, the service appears to aim to serve as an exchange (or ad network) for matching many advertisers with many small sites. In general, the more blogs AdSense can reach, the more advertisers it will attract, making it the most attractive option for more blogs.

By contrast, the value of a news site is primarily proportional to the quality of the articles, not to the number of other people using the site. Similarly, the first generation of search engines experienced little network effect, as the value of the site was based on the value of the search results. This allowed Google to win users away from Yahoo! without much trouble, once users believed that Google&#x27;s search results were superior. Some commentators mistook the value of the Yahoo! brand (which does increase as more people know of it) for a network effect protecting its advertising business.

===Rail gauge===

There are strong network effects in the initial choice of rail gauge, and in gauge conversion decisions. Even when placing isolated rails not connected to any other lines, track layers usually choose a standard rail gauge so they can use off-the-shelf rolling stock. Although a few manufacturers make rolling stock that can adjust to different rail gauges, most manufacturers make rolling stock that only works with one of the standard rail gauges. This even applies to urban rail systems where historically tramways and to a lesser extent metros would come in a wide array of different gauges, nowadays virtually all new networks are built to a handful of gauges and overwhelmingly standard gauge.

=== Credit cards ===
For credit cards that are now widely used, large-scale applications on the market are closely related to network effects. Credit card, as one of the currency payment methods in the current economy, which was originated in 1949. Early research on the circulation of credit cards at the retail level found that credit card interest rates were not affected by macroeconomic interest rates and remained almost unchanged. Later, credit cards gradually entered the network level due to changes in policy priorities and became a popular trend in payment in the 1980s. Different levels of credit cards separate benefit from two types of network effects. The application of credit cards related to external network effects, which is because when this has become a payment method, and more people use credit cards. Each additional person uses the same credit card, the value of rest people who use the credit card will increase. Besides, the credit card system at the network level could be seen as a two-sided market. On the one hand, the number of cardholders attracts merchants to use credit cards as a payment method. On the other hand, an increasing number of merchants can also attract more new cardholders. In other words, the use of credit cards has increased significantly among merchants which leads to increased value. This can conversely increase the cardholder&#x27;s credit card value and the number of users. Moreover, credit card services also display a network effect between merchant discounts and credit accessibility. When credit accessibility increases which greater sales can be obtained, merchants are willing to be charged more discounts by credit card issuers.

Visa has become a leader in the electronic payment industry through the network effect of credit cards as its competitive advantage. Till 2016, Visa&#x27;s credit card market share has risen from a quarter to as much as half in four years. Visa benefits from the network effect. Since every additional Visa cardholder is more attractive to merchants, and merchants can also attract more new cardholders through the brand. In other words, the popularity and convenience of Visa in the electronic payment market, lead more people and merchants choose to use Visa, which greatly increases the value of Visa.

<text>Nuclear fission is a reaction in which the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller nuclei. The fission process often produces gamma photons, and releases a very large amount of energy even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay.

Nuclear fission was discovered by chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann and physicists Lise Meitner and Otto Robert Frisch. Hahn and Strassmann proved that a fission reaction had taken place on 19 December 1938, and Meitner and her nephew Frisch explained it theoretically in January 1939. Frisch named the process &quot;fission&quot; by analogy with biological fission of living cells. In their second publication on nuclear fission in February 1939, Hahn and Strassmann predicted the existence and liberation of additional neutrons during the fission process, opening up the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction.

For heavy nuclides, it is an exothermic reaction which can release large amounts of energy both as electromagnetic radiation and as kinetic energy of the fragments (heating the bulk material where fission takes place). Like nuclear fusion, for fission to produce energy, the total binding energy of the resulting elements must be greater than that of the starting element.

Fission is a form of nuclear transmutation because the resulting fragments (or daughter atoms) are not the same element as the original parent atom. The two (or more) nuclei produced are most often of comparable but slightly different sizes, typically with a mass ratio of products of about 3 to 2, for common fissile isotopes. Most fissions are binary fissions (producing two charged fragments), but occasionally (2 to 4 times per 1000 events), &quot;three&quot; positively charged fragments are produced, in a ternary fission. The smallest of these fragments in ternary processes ranges in size from a proton to an argon nucleus.

Apart from fission induced by an exogenous neutron, harnessed and exploited by humans, a natural form of spontaneous radioactive decay (not requiring an exogenous neutron, because the nucleus already has an overabundance of neutrons) is also referred to as fission, and occurs especially in very high-mass-number isotopes. Spontaneous fission was discovered in 1940 by Flyorov, Petrzhak, and Kurchatov in Moscow, in an experiment intended to confirm that, without bombardment by neutrons, the fission rate of uranium was negligible, as predicted by Niels Bohr; it was not negligible. Despite the possibility of spontaneous fission, it does not play any role for energy production of stars. In contrast to nuclear fusion, which drives the formation of stars and their development, one can consider nuclear fission as neglectable for the evolution of the universe. Accordingly, all elements (with a few exceptions, see &quot;spontaneous fission&quot;) which are important for the formation of solar systems, planets and also for all forms of life are not fission products, but rather the results of fusion processes.

The unpredictable composition of the products (which vary in a broad probabilistic and somewhat chaotic manner) distinguishes fission from purely quantum tunneling processes such as proton emission, alpha decay, and cluster decay, which give the same products each time. Nuclear fission produces energy for nuclear power and drives the explosion of nuclear weapons. Both uses are possible because certain substances called nuclear fuels undergo fission when struck by fission neutrons, and in turn emit neutrons when they break apart. This makes a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction possible, releasing energy at a controlled rate in a nuclear reactor or at a very rapid, uncontrolled rate in a nuclear weapon.

The amount of free energy released in the fission of an equivalent amount of is a million times more than that released in the combustion of methane or from hydrogen fuel cells.

The products of nuclear fission, however, are on average far more radioactive than the heavy elements which are normally fissioned as fuel, and remain so for significant amounts of time, giving rise to a nuclear waste problem. However, the seven long-lived fission products make up only a small fraction of fission products. Neutron absorption which does not lead to fission produces plutonium (from ) and minor actinides (from both and ) whose radiotoxicity is far higher than that of the long lived fission products. Concerns over nuclear waste accumulation and the destructive potential of nuclear weapons are a counterbalance to the peaceful desire to use fission as an energy source. The thorium fuel cycle produces virtually no plutonium and much less minor actinides, but - or rather its decay products - are a major gamma ray emitter. All actinides are fertile or fissile and fast breeder reactors can fission them all albeit only in certain configurations. Nuclear reprocessing aims to recover usable material from spent nuclear fuel to both enable uranium (and thorium) supplies to last longer and to reduce the amount of &quot;waste&quot;. The industry term for a process that fissions all or nearly all actinides is a &quot;closed fuel cycle&quot;.

==Physical overview==

===Mechanism===
Younes and Loveland define fission as, &quot;...a collective motion of the protons and neutrons that make up the nucleus, and as such it is distinguishable from other phenomena that break up the nucleus. Nuclear fission is an extreme example of large-amplitude collective motion that results in the division of a parent nucleus into two or more fragment nuclei. The fission process can occur spontaneously, or it can be induced by an incident particle.&quot; The energy from a fission reaction is produced by its fission products, though a large majority of it, about 85 percent, is found in fragment kinetic energy, while about 6 percent each comes from initial neutrons and gamma rays and those emitted after beta decay, plus about 3 percent from neutrinos as the product of such decay.


====Radioactive decay====
Nuclear fission can occur without neutron bombardment as a type of radioactive decay. This type of fission is called spontaneous fission, and was first observed in 1940.

====Nuclear reaction====
During induced fission, a compound system is formed after an incident particle fuses with a target. The resultant excitation energy may be sufficient to emit neutrons, or gamma-rays, and nuclear scission. Fission into two fragments is called binary fission, and is the most common nuclear reaction. Occurring least frequently is ternary fission, in which a third particle is emitted. This third particle is commonly an α particle. Since in nuclear fission, the nucleus emits more neutrons than the one it absorbs, a chain reaction is possible.

Binary fission may produce any of the fission products, at 95±15 and 135±15 daltons. However, the binary process happens merely because it is the most probable. In anywhere from two to four fissions per 1000 in a nuclear reactor, ternary fission can produce three positively charged fragments (plus neutrons) and the smallest of these may range from so small a charge and mass as a proton (&quot;Z&quot; = 1), to as large a fragment as argon (&quot;Z&quot; = 18). The most common small fragments, however, are composed of 90% helium-4 nuclei with more energy than alpha particles from alpha decay (so-called &quot;long range alphas&quot; at ~16 megaelectronvolts (MeV)), plus helium-6 nuclei, and tritons (the nuclei of tritium). Though less common than binary fission, it still produces significant helium-4 and tritium gas buildup in the fuel rods of modern nuclear reactors.

Bohr and Wheeler used their liquid drop model, the packing fraction curve of Arthur Jeffrey Dempster, and Eugene Feenberg&#x27;s estimates of nucleus radius and surface tension, to estimate the mass differences of parent and daughters in fission. They then equated this mass difference to energy using Einstein&#x27;s mass-energy equivalence formula. The stimulation of the nucleus after neutron bombardment was analogous to the vibrations of a liquid drop, with surface tension and the Coulomb force in opposition. Plotting the sum of these two energies as a function of elongated shape, they determined the resultant energy surface had a saddle shape. The saddle provided an energy barrier called the critical energy barrier. Energy of about 6 MeV provided by the incident neutron was necessary to overcome this barrier and cause the nucleus to fission. According to John Lilley, &quot;The energy required to overcome the barrier to fission is called the &quot;activation energy&quot; or &quot;fission barrier&quot; and is about 6 MeV for &quot;A&quot; ≈ 240. It is found that the activation energy decreases as A increases. Eventually, a point is reached where activation energy disappears altogether...it would undergo very rapid spontaneous fission.&quot;

Maria Goeppert Mayer later proposed the nuclear shell model for the nucleus. The nuclides that can sustain a fission chain reaction are suitable for use as nuclear fuels. The most common nuclear fuels are 235U (the isotope of uranium with mass number 235 and of use in nuclear reactors) and 239Pu (the isotope of plutonium with mass number 239). These fuels break apart into a bimodal range of chemical elements with atomic masses centering near 95 and 135 daltons (fission products). Most nuclear fuels undergo spontaneous fission only very slowly, decaying instead mainly via an alpha-beta decay chain over periods of millennia to eons. In a nuclear reactor or nuclear weapon, the overwhelming majority of fission events are induced by bombardment with another particle, a neutron, which is itself produced by prior fission events.

Fissionable isotopes such as uranium-238 require additional energy provided by fast neutrons (such as those produced by nuclear fusion in thermonuclear weapons). While &quot;some&quot; of the neutrons released from the fission of are fast enough to induce another fission in , &quot;most&quot; are not, meaning it can never achieve criticality. While there is a very small (albeit nonzero) chance of a thermal neutron inducing fission in , neutron absorption is orders of magnitude more likely.

===Energetics===

====Input====
Fission cross sections are a measurable property related to the probability that fission will occur in a nuclear reaction. Cross sections are a function of incident neutron energy, and those for and are a million times higher than at lower neutron energy levels. Absorption of any neutron makes available to the nucleus binding energy of about 5.3 MeV. needs a fast neutron to supply the additional 1 MeV needed to cross the critical energy barrier for fission. In the case of however, that extra energy is provided when adjusts from an odd to an even mass. In the words of Younes and Lovelace, &quot;...the neutron absorption on a target forms a nucleus with excitation energy greater than the critical fission energy, whereas in the case of &quot;n&quot; + , the resulting nucleus has an excitation energy below the critical fission energy.&quot;

About 6 MeV of the fission-input energy is supplied by the simple binding of an extra neutron to the heavy nucleus via the strong force; however, in many fissionable isotopes, this amount of energy is not enough for fission. Uranium-238, for example, has a near-zero fission cross section for neutrons of less than 1 MeV energy. If no additional energy is supplied by any other mechanism, the nucleus will not fission, but will merely absorb the neutron, as happens when absorbs slow and even some fraction of fast neutrons, to become . The remaining energy to initiate fission can be supplied by two other mechanisms: one of these is more kinetic energy of the incoming neutron, which is increasingly able to fission a fissionable heavy nucleus as it exceeds a kinetic energy of 1 MeV or more (so-called fast neutrons). Such high energy neutrons are able to fission directly (see thermonuclear weapon for application, where the fast neutrons are supplied by nuclear fusion). However, this process cannot happen to a great extent in a nuclear reactor, as too small a fraction of the fission neutrons produced by any type of fission have enough energy to efficiently fission . (For example, neutrons from thermal fission of have a mean energy of 2 MeV, a median energy of 1.6 MeV, and a mode of 0.75 MeV, and the energy spectrum for fast fission is similar.)

Among the heavy actinide elements, however, those isotopes that have an odd number of neutrons (such as 235U with 143 neutrons) bind an extra neutron with an additional 1 to 2 MeV of energy over an isotope of the same element with an even number of neutrons (such as 238U with 146 neutrons). This extra binding energy is made available as a result of the mechanism of neutron pairing effects, which itself is caused by the Pauli exclusion principle, allowing an extra neutron to occupy the same nuclear orbital as the last neutron in the nucleus. In such isotopes, therefore, no neutron kinetic energy is needed, for all the necessary energy is supplied by absorption of any neutron, either of the slow or fast variety (the former are used in moderated nuclear reactors, and the latter are used in fast-neutron reactors, and in weapons).

According to Younes and Loveland, &quot;Actinides like that fission easily following the absorption of a thermal (0.25 meV) neutron are called &quot;fissile&quot;, whereas those like that do not easily fission when they absorb a thermal neutron are called &quot;fissionable&quot;.&quot;

====Output====
After an incident particle has fused with a parent nucleus, if the excitation energy is sufficient, the nucleus breaks into fragments. This is called scission, and occurs at about 10−20 seconds. The fragments can emit prompt neutrons at between 10−18 and 10−15 seconds. At about 10−11 seconds, the fragments can emit gamma rays. At 10−3 seconds β decay, β-delayed neutrons, and gamma rays are emitted from the decay products.

Typical fission events release about two hundred million eV (200 MeV) of energy, the equivalent of roughly &gt;2 trillion kelvin, for each fission event. The exact isotope which is fissioned, and whether or not it is fissionable or fissile, has only a small impact on the amount of energy released. This can be easily seen by examining the curve of binding energy (image below), and noting that the average binding energy of the actinide nuclides beginning with uranium is around 7.6 MeV per nucleon. Looking further left on the curve of binding energy, where the fission products cluster, it is easily observed that the binding energy of the fission products tends to center around 8.5 MeV per nucleon. Thus, in any fission event of an isotope in the actinide mass range, roughly 0.9 MeV are released per nucleon of the starting element. The fission of 235U by a slow neutron yields nearly identical energy to the fission of 238U by a fast neutron. This energy release profile holds for thorium and the various minor actinides as well.
When a uranium nucleus fissions into two daughter nuclei fragments, about 0.1 percent of the mass of the uranium nucleus appears as the fission energy of ~200 MeV. For uranium-235 (total mean fission energy 202.79 MeV), typically ~169 MeV appears as the kinetic energy of the daughter nuclei, which fly apart at about 3% of the speed of light, due to Coulomb repulsion. Also, an average of 2.5 neutrons are emitted, with a mean kinetic energy per neutron of ~2 MeV (total of 4.8 MeV). The fission reaction also releases ~7 MeV in prompt gamma ray photons. The latter figure means that a nuclear fission explosion or criticality accident emits about 3.5% of its energy as gamma rays, less than 2.5% of its energy as fast neutrons (total of both types of radiation ~6%), and the rest as kinetic energy of fission fragments (this appears almost immediately when the fragments impact surrounding matter, as simple heat).

Some processes involving neutrons are notable for absorbing or finally yielding energy — for example neutron kinetic energy does not yield heat immediately if the neutron is captured by a uranium-238 atom to breed plutonium-239, but this energy is emitted if the plutonium-239 is later fissioned. On the other hand, so-called delayed neutrons emitted as radioactive decay products with half-lives up to several minutes, from fission-daughters, are very important to reactor control, because they give a characteristic &quot;reaction&quot; time for the total nuclear reaction to double in size, if the reaction is run in a &quot;delayed-critical&quot; zone which deliberately relies on these neutrons for a supercritical chain-reaction (one in which each fission cycle yields more neutrons than it absorbs). Without their existence, the nuclear chain-reaction would be prompt critical and increase in size faster than it could be controlled by human intervention. In this case, the first experimental atomic reactors would have run away to a dangerous and messy &quot;prompt critical reaction&quot; before their operators could have manually shut them down (for this reason, designer Enrico Fermi included radiation-counter-triggered control rods, suspended by electromagnets, which could automatically drop into the center of Chicago Pile-1). If these delayed neutrons are captured without producing fissions, they produce heat as well.

===Binding energy===

The binding energy of the nucleus is the difference between the rest-mass energy of the nucleus and the rest-mass energy of the neutron and proton nucleons. The binding energy formula includes volume, surface and Coulomb energy terms that include empirically derived coefficients for all three, plus energy ratios of a deformed nucleus relative to a spherical form for the surface and Coulomb terms. Additional terms can be included such as symmetry, pairing, the finite range of the nuclear force, and charge distribution within the nuclei to improve the estimate. Normally binding energy is referred to and plotted as average binding energy per nucleon.

According to Lilley, &quot;The binding energy of a nucleus is the energy required to separate it into its constituent neutrons and protons.&quot;
formula_1
where is mass number, is atomic number, is the atomic mass of a hydrogen atom, is the mass of a neutron, and is the speed of light. Thus, the mass of an atom is less than the mass of its constituent protons and neutrons, assuming the average binding energy of its electrons is negligible. The binding energy is expressed in energy units, using Einstein&#x27;s mass-energy equivalence relationship. The binding energy also provides an estimate of the total energy released from fission.

The curve of binding energy is characterized by a broad maximum near mass number 60 at 8.6 MeV, then gradually decreases to 7.6 MeV at the highest mass numbers. Mass numbers higher than 238 are rare. At the lighter end of the scale, peaks are noted for helium-4, and the multiples such as beryllium-8, carbon-12, oxygen-16, neon-20 and magnesium-24. Binding energy due to the nuclear force approaches a constant value for large , while the Coulomb acts over a larger distance so that electrical potential energy per proton grows as increases. Fission energy is released when a is larger than 120 nucleus fragments. Fusion energy is released when lighter nuclei combine.

Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker&#x27;s semi-empirical mass formula may be used to express the binding energy as the sum of five terms, which are the volume energy, a surface correction, Coulomb energy, a symmetry term, and a pairing term:

formula_2 
where the nuclear binding energy is proportional to the nuclear volume, while nucleons near the surface interact with fewer nucleons, reducing the effect of the volume term. According to Lilley, &quot;For all naturally occurring nuclei, the surface-energy term dominates and the nucleus exists in a state of equilibrium.&quot; The negative contribution of Coulomb energy arises from the repulsive electric force of the protons. The symmetry term arises from the fact that effective forces in the nucleus are stronger for unlike neutron-proton pairs, rather than like neutron–neutron or proton–proton pairs. The pairing term arises from the fact that like nucleons form spin-zero pairs in the same spatial state. The pairing is positive if and are both even, adding to the binding energy.

In fission there is a preference for fission fragments with even , which is called the odd–even effect on the fragments&#x27; charge distribution. This can be seen in the empirical fragment yield data for each fission product, as products with even have higher yield values. However, no odd–even effect is observed on fragment distribution based on their . This result is attributed to nucleon pair breaking.

In nuclear fission events the nuclei may break into any combination of lighter nuclei, but the most common event is not fission to equal mass nuclei of about mass 120; the most common event (depending on isotope and process) is a slightly unequal fission in which one daughter nucleus has a mass of about 90 to 100 daltons and the other the remaining 130 to 140 daltons.

Stable nuclei, and unstable nuclei with very long half-lives, follow a trend of stability evident when is plotted against . For lighter nuclei less than = 20, the line has the slope = , while the heavier nuclei require additional neutrons to remain stable. Nuclei that are neutron- or proton-rich have excessive binding energy for stability, and the excess energy may convert a neutron to a proton or a proton to a neutron via the weak nuclear force, a process known as beta decay.

Neutron-induced fission of U-235 emits a total energy of 207 MeV, of which about 200 MeV is recoverable, Prompt fission fragments amount to 168 MeV, which are easily stopped with a fraction of a millimeter. Prompt neutrons total 5 MeV, and this energy is recovered as heat via scattering in the reactor. However, many fission fragments are neutron-rich and decay via β− emissions. According to Lilley, &quot;The radioactive decay energy from the fission chains is the second release of energy due to fission. It is much less than the prompt energy, but it is a significant amount and is why reactors must continue to be cooled after they have been shut down and why the waste products must be handled with great care and stored safely.&quot;

===Chain reactions===
John Lilley states, &quot;...neutron-induced fission generates extra neutrons which can induce further fissions in the next generation and so on in a chain reaction. The chain reaction is characterized by the &quot;neutron multiplication factor k&quot;, which is defined as the ratio of the number of neutrons in one generation to the number in the preceding generation. If, in a reactor, &quot;k&quot; is less than unity, the reactor is subcritical, the number of neutrons decreases and the chain reaction dies out. If &quot;k&quot; &gt; 1, the reactor is supercritical and the chain reaction diverges. This is the situation in a fission bomb where growth is at an explosive rate. If &quot;k&quot; is exactly unity, the reactions proceed at a steady rate and the reactor is said to be critical. It is possible to achieve criticality in a reactor using natural uranium as fuel, provided that the neutrons have been efficiently moderated to thermal energies.&quot; Moderators include light water, heavy water, and graphite.

According to John C. Lee, &quot;For all nuclear reactors in operation and those under development, the nuclear fuel cycle is based on one of three &quot;fissile&quot; materials, 235U, 233U, and 239Pu, and the associated isotopic chains. For the current generation of LWRs, the enriched U contains 2.5~4.5 wt% of 235U, which is fabricated into UO2 fuel rods and loaded into fuel assemblies.&quot;

Lee states, &quot;One important comparison for the three major fissile nuclides, 235U, 233U, and 239Pu, is their breeding potential. A &quot;breeder&quot; is by definition a reactor that produces more fissile material than it consumes and needs a minimum of two neutrons produced for each neutron absorbed in a fissile nucleus. Thus, in general, the &quot;conversion ratio (CR) is defined as the ratio of fissile material produced to that destroyed&quot;...when the CR is greater than 1.0, it is called the &quot;breeding ratio&quot; (BR)...233U offers a superior breeding potential for both thermal and fast reactors, while 239Pu offers a superior breeding potential for fast reactors.&quot;

===Fission reactors===
Critical fission reactors are the most common type of nuclear reactor. In a critical fission reactor, neutrons produced by fission of fuel atoms are used to induce yet more fissions, to sustain a controllable amount of energy release. Devices that produce engineered but non-self-sustaining fission reactions are subcritical fission reactors. Such devices use radioactive decay or particle accelerators to trigger fissions.

Critical fission reactors are built for three primary purposes, which typically involve different engineering trade-offs to take advantage of either the heat or the neutrons produced by the fission chain reaction:
*&quot;power reactors&quot; are intended to produce heat for nuclear power, either as part of a generating station or a local power system such as a nuclear submarine.
*&quot;research reactors&quot; are intended to produce neutrons and/or activate radioactive sources for scientific, medical, engineering, or other research purposes.
*&quot;breeder reactors&quot; are intended to produce nuclear fuels in bulk from more abundant isotopes. The better known fast breeder reactor makes 239Pu (a nuclear fuel) from the naturally very abundant 238U (not a nuclear fuel). Thermal breeder reactors previously tested using 232Th to breed the fissile isotope 233U (thorium fuel cycle) continue to be studied and developed.

While, in principle, all fission reactors can act in all three capacities, in practice the tasks lead to conflicting engineering goals and most reactors have been built with only one of the above tasks in mind. (There are several early counter-examples, such as the Hanford N reactor, now decommissioned).

As of 2019, the 448 nuclear power plants worldwide provided a capacity of 398 GWE, with about 85% being light-water cooled reactors such as pressurized water reactors or boiling water reactors. Energy from fission is transmitted through conduction or convection to the nuclear reactor coolant, then to a heat exchanger, and the resultant generated steam is used to drive a turbine or generator.

===Fission bombs===

The objective of an atomic bomb is to produce a device, according to Serber, &quot;...in which energy is released by a fast neutron chain reaction in one or more of the materials known to show nuclear fission.&quot; According to Rhodes, &quot;Untamped, a bomb core even as large as twice the critical mass would completely fission less than 1 percent of its nuclear material before it expanded enough to stop the chain reaction from proceeding. Tamper always increased efficiency: it reflected neutrons back into the core and its inertia...slowed the core&#x27;s expansion and helped keep the core surface from blowing away.&quot; Rearrangement of the core material&#x27;s subcritical components would need to proceed as fast as possible to ensure effective detonation. Additionally, a third basic component was necessary, &quot;...an initiator—a Ra + Be source or, better, a Po + Be source, with the radium or polonium attached perhaps to one piece of the core and the beryllium to the other, to smash together and spray neutrons when the parts mated to start the chain reaction.&quot; However, any bomb would &quot;necessitate locating, mining and processing hundreds of tons of uranium ore...&quot;, while U-235 separation or the production of Pu-239 would require additional industrial capacity.

==History==

===Discovery of nuclear fission===

The discovery of nuclear fission occurred in 1938 in the buildings of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for Chemistry, today part of the Free University of Berlin, following over four decades of work on the science of radioactivity and the elaboration of new nuclear physics that described the components of atoms. In 1911, Ernest Rutherford proposed a model of the atom in which a very small, dense and positively charged nucleus of protons was surrounded by orbiting, negatively charged electrons (the Rutherford model). Niels Bohr improved upon this in 1913 by reconciling the quantum behavior of electrons (the Bohr model). In 1928, George Gamow proposed the Liquid drop model, which became essential to understanding the physics 
of fission.

In 1896, Henri Becquerel had found, and Marie Curie named, radioactivity. In 1900, Rutherford and Frederick Soddy, investigating the radioactive gas emanating from thorium, &quot;conveyed the tremendous and inevitable conclusion that the element thorium was slowly and spontaneously transmuting itself into argon gas!&quot;

In 1919, following up on an earlier anomaly Ernest Marsden noted in 1915, Rutherford attempted to &quot;break up the atom.&quot; Rutherford was able to accomplish the first artificial transmutation of nitrogen into oxygen, using alpha particles directed at nitrogen 14N + α → 17O + p.  Rutherford stated, &quot;...we must conclude that the nitrogen atom is disintegrated,&quot; while the newspapers stated he had &quot;split the atom&quot;. This was the first observation of a nuclear reaction, that is, a reaction in which particles from one decay are used to transform another atomic nucleus. It also offered a new way to study the nucleus. Rutherford and James Chadwick then used alpha particles to &quot;disintegrate&quot; boron, fluorine, sodium, aluminum, and phosphorus before reaching a limitation associated with the energy of his alpha particle source. Eventually, in 1932, a fully artificial nuclear reaction and nuclear transmutation was achieved by Rutherford&#x27;s colleagues Ernest Walton and John Cockcroft, who used artificially accelerated protons against lithium-7, to split this nucleus into two alpha particles. The feat was popularly known as &quot;splitting the atom&quot;, and would win them the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics for &quot;Transmutation of atomic nuclei by artificially accelerated atomic particles&quot;, although it was not the nuclear fission reaction later discovered in heavy elements.

English physicist James Chadwick discovered the neutron in 1932. Chadwick used an ionization chamber to observe protons knocked out of several elements 
by beryllium radiation, following up on earlier observations made by Joliot-Curies. In Chadwick&#x27;s words, &quot;...In order to explain the great penetrating power of the radiation we must further assume that the particle has no net charge...&quot; The existence of the neutron was first postulated by Rutherford in 1920, and in the words of Chadwick, &quot;...how on earth were you going to build up a big nucleus with a large positive charge? And the answer was a neutral particle.&quot; Subsequently, he communicated his findings in more detail.

In the words of Richard Rhodes, referring to the neutron, &quot;It would therefore serve as a new nuclear probe of surpassing power of penetration.&quot; Philip Morrison stated, &quot;A beam of thermal neutrons moving at about the speed of sound...produces nuclear reactions in many materials much more easily than a beam of protons...traveling thousands of times faster.&quot; 
According to Rhodes, &quot;Slowing down a neutron gave it more time in the vicinity of the nucleus, and that gave it more time to be captured.&quot; Fermi&#x27;s team, studying radiative capture which is the emission of gamma radiation after the nucleus captures a neutron, studied sixty elements, inducing radioactivity in forty. In the process, they discovered the ability of hydrogen to slow down the neutrons.

Enrico Fermi and his colleagues in Rome studied the results of bombarding uranium with neutrons in 1934. Fermi concluded that his experiments had created new elements with 93 and 94 protons, which the group dubbed ausenium and hesperium. However, not all were convinced by Fermi&#x27;s analysis of his results, though he would win the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his &quot;demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation, and for his related discovery of nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons&quot;. The German chemist Ida Noddack notably suggested in 1934 that instead of creating a new, heavier element 93, that &quot;it is conceivable that the nucleus breaks up into several large fragments.&quot; However, the quoted objection comes some distance down, and was but one of several gaps she noted in Fermi&#x27;s claim. Although Noddack was a renowned analytical chemist, she lacked the background in physics to appreciate the enormity of what she was proposing.

After the Fermi publication, Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and Fritz Strassmann began performing similar experiments in Berlin. Meitner, an Austrian Jew, lost her Austrian citizenship with the &quot;Anschluss&quot;, the union of Austria with Germany in March 1938, but she fled in July 1938 to Sweden and started a correspondence by mail with Hahn in Berlin. By coincidence, her nephew Otto Robert Frisch, also a refugee, was also in Sweden when Meitner received a letter from Hahn dated 19 December describing his chemical proof that some of the product of the bombardment of uranium with neutrons was barium. Hahn suggested a &quot;bursting&quot; of the nucleus, but he was unsure of what the physical basis for the results were. Barium had an atomic mass 40% less than uranium, and no previously known methods of radioactive decay could account for such a large difference in the mass of the nucleus. Frisch was skeptical, but Meitner trusted Hahn&#x27;s ability as a chemist. Marie Curie had been separating barium from radium for many years, and the techniques were well-known. Meitner and Frisch then correctly interpreted Hahn&#x27;s results to mean that the nucleus of uranium had split roughly in half. Frisch suggested the process be named &quot;nuclear fission&quot;, by analogy to the process of living cell division into two cells, which was then called binary fission. Just as the term nuclear &quot;chain reaction&quot; would later be borrowed from chemistry, so the term &quot;fission&quot; was borrowed from biology.

News spread quickly of the new discovery, which was correctly seen as an entirely novel physical effect with great scientific—and potentially practical—possibilities. Meitner&#x27;s and Frisch&#x27;s interpretation of the discovery of Hahn and Strassmann crossed the Atlantic Ocean with Niels Bohr, who was to lecture at Princeton University. I.I. Rabi and Willis Lamb, two Columbia University physicists working at Princeton, heard the news and carried it back to Columbia. Rabi said he told Enrico Fermi; Fermi gave credit to Lamb. Bohr soon thereafter went from Princeton to Columbia to see Fermi. Not finding Fermi in his office, Bohr went down to the cyclotron area and found Herbert L. Anderson. Bohr grabbed him by the shoulder and said: &quot;Young man, let me explain to you about something new and exciting in physics.&quot;

It was clear to a number of scientists at Columbia that they should try to detect the energy released in the nuclear fission of uranium from neutron bombardment. On 25 January 1939, a Columbia University team conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States, which was done in the basement of Pupin Hall. The experiment involved placing uranium oxide inside of an ionization chamber and irradiating it with neutrons, and measuring the energy thus released. The results confirmed that fission was occurring and hinted strongly that it was the isotope uranium 235 in particular that was fissioning. The next day, the fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics began in Washington, D.C. under the joint auspices of the George Washington University and the Carnegie Institution of Washington. There, the news on nuclear fission was spread even further, which fostered many more experimental demonstrations.
The 6 January 1939 Hahn and Strassman paper announced the discover of fission. In their second publication on nuclear fission in February 1939, Hahn and Strassmann used the term &quot;Uranspaltung&quot; (uranium fission) for the first time, and predicted the existence and liberation of additional neutrons during the fission process, opening up the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction. The 11 February 1939 paper by Meitner and Frisch compared the process to the division of a liquid drop and estimated the energy released at 200 MeV. The 1 September 1939 paper by Bohr and Wheeler used this liquid drop model to quantify fission details, including the energy released, estimated the cross section for neutron-induced fission, and deduced was the major contributor to that cross section and slow-neutron fission.

===Fission chain reaction realized===
During this period the Hungarian physicist Leó Szilárd realized that the neutron-driven fission of heavy atoms could be used to create a nuclear chain reaction. Such a reaction using neutrons was an idea he had first formulated in 1933, upon reading Rutherford&#x27;s disparaging remarks about generating power from neutron collisions. However, Szilárd had not been able to achieve a neutron-driven chain reaction using beryllium. Szilard stated, &quot;...if we could find an element which is split by neutrons and which would emit &quot;two&quot; neutrons when it absorbs &quot;one&quot; neutron, such an element, if assembled in sufficiently large mass, could sustain a nuclear chain reaction.&quot; On 25 January 1939, after learning of Hahn&#x27;s discovery from Eugene Wigner, Szilard noted, &quot;...if enough neutrons are emitted...then it should be, of course, possible to sustain a chain reaction. All of the things which H. G. Wells predicted appeared suddenly real to me.&quot; After the Hahn-Strassman paper was published, Szilard noted in a letter to Lewis Strauss, that during the fission of uranium, &quot;the energy released in this new reaction must be very much higher than all previously known cases...,&quot; which might lead to &quot;large-scale production of energy and radioactive elements, unfortunately also perhaps to atomic bombs.&quot;

Szilard now urged Fermi (in New York) and Frédéric Joliot-Curie (in Paris) to refrain from publishing on the possibility of a chain reaction, lest the Nazi government become aware of the possibilities on the eve of what would later be known as World War II. With some hesitation Fermi agreed to self-censor. But Joliot-Curie did not, and in April 1939 his team in Paris, including Hans von Halban and Lew Kowarski, reported in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; that the number of neutrons emitted with nuclear fission of uranium was then reported at 3.5 per fission. Szilard and Walter Zinn found &quot;...the number of neutrons emitted by fission to be about two.&quot; Fermi and Anderson estimated &quot;a yield of about two neutrons per each neutron captured.&quot;

With the news of fission neutrons from uranium fission, Szilárd immediately understood the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction using uranium. In the summer, Fermi and Szilard proposed the idea of a nuclear reactor (pile) to mediate this process. The pile would use natural uranium as fuel. Fermi had shown much earlier that neutrons were far more effectively captured by atoms if they were of low energy (so-called &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;thermal&quot; neutrons), because for quantum reasons it made the atoms look like much larger targets to the neutrons. Thus to slow down the secondary neutrons released by the fissioning uranium nuclei, Fermi and Szilard proposed a graphite &quot;moderator&quot;, against which the fast, high-energy secondary neutrons would collide, effectively slowing them down. With enough uranium, and with sufficiently pure graphite, their &quot;pile&quot; could theoretically sustain a slow-neutron chain reaction. This would result in the production of heat, as well as the creation of radioactive fission products.

In August 1939, Szilard, Teller and Wigner thought that the Germans might make use of the fission chain reaction and were spurred to attempt to attract the attention of the United States government to the issue. Towards this, they persuaded Albert Einstein to lend his name to a letter directed to President Franklin Roosevelt. On 11 October, the Einstein–Szilárd letter was delivered via Alexander Sachs. Roosevelt quickly understood the implications, stating, &quot;Alex, what you are after is to see that the Nazis don&#x27;t blow us up.&quot; Roosevelt ordered the formation of the Advisory Committee on Uranium.

In February 1940, encouraged by Fermi and John R. Dunning, Alfred O. C. Nier was able to separate U-235 and U-238 from uranium tetrachloride in a glass mass spectrometer. Subsequently, Dunning, bombarding the U-235 sample with neutrons generated by the Columbia University cyclotron, confirmed &quot;U-235 was responsible for the slow neutron fission of uranium.&quot;

At the University of Birmingham, Frisch teamed up with Peierls, who had been working on a critical mass formula. assuming isotope separation was possible, they considered 235U, which had a cross section not yet determined, but which was assumed to be much larger than that of natural uranium. They calculated only a pound or two in a volume less than a golf ball, would result in a chain reaction faster than vaporization, and the resultant explosion would generate temperature greater than the interior of the sun, and pressures greater than the center of the earth. Additionally, the costs of isotope separation &quot;would be insignificant compared to the cost of the war.&quot; By March 1940, encouraged by Mark Oliphant, they wrote the Frisch–Peierls memorandum in two parts, &quot;On the construction of a &#x27;super-bomb; based on a nuclear chain reaction in uranium,&quot; and &quot;Memorandum on the properties of a radioactive &#x27;super-bomb.&#x27; &quot;. On 10 April 1940, the first meeting of the MAUD Committee was held.

In December 1940, Franz Simon at Oxford wrote his Estimate of the size of an actual separation plant.&quot; Simon proposed gaseous diffusion as the best method for uranium isotope separation.

On 28 March 1941, Emilio Segré and Glen Seaborg reported on the &quot;strong indications that 239Pu undergoes fission with slow neutrons.&quot; This meant chemical separation was an alternative to uranium isotope separation. Instead, a nuclear reactor fueled with ordinary uranium could produce a plutonium isotope as a nuclear explosive substitute for 235U. In May, they demonstrated the cross section of plutonium was 1.7 times that of U235. When plutonium&#x27;s cross section for fast fission was measured to be ten times that of U238, plutonium became a viable option for a bomb.

In October 1941, MAUD released its final report to the U.S. Government. The report stated, &quot;We have now reached the conclusion that it will be possible to make an effective uranium bomb...The material for the first bomb could be ready by the end of 1943...&quot;

In November 1941, John Dunning and Eugene T. Booth were able to demonstrate the enrichment of uranium through gaseous barrier diffusion. On 27 November, Bush delivered to third National Academy of Sciences report to Roosevelt. The report, amongst other things, called for parallel development of all isotope-separation systems. On 6 December, Bush and Conant reorganized the Uranium Committee&#x27;s tasks, with Harold Urey developing gaseous diffusion, Lawrence developing electromagnetic separation, Eger V. Murphree developing centrifuges, and Arthur Compton responsible for theoretical studies and design.

On 23 April 1942, Met Lab scientists discussed seven possible ways to extract plutonium from irradiated uranium, and decided to pursue investigation of all seven. On 17 June, the first batch of uranium nitrate hexahydrate (UNH) was undergoing neutron bombardment in the Washington University in St. Louis cyclotron. On 27 July, the irradiated UNH was ready for Glenn T. Seaborg&#x27;s team. On 20 August, using ultramicrochemistry techniques, they successfully extracted plutonium.

In April 1939, creating a chain reaction in natural uranium became the goal of Fermi and Szilard, as opposed to isotope separation. Their first efforts involved five hundred pounds of uranium oxide from the Eldorado Radium Corporation. Packed into fifty-two cans two inches in diameter and two feet long in a tank of manganese solution, they were able to confirm more neutrons were emitted than absorbed. However, the hydrogen within the water absorbed the slow neutrons necessary for fission. Carbon in the form of graphite, was then considered, because of its smaller capture cross section. In April 1940, Fermi was able to confirm carbon&#x27;s potential for a slow-neutron chain reaction, after receiving National Carbon Company&#x27;s graphite bricks at their Pupin Laboratories. In August and September, the Columbia team enlarged upon the cross section measurements by making a series of exponential &quot;piles&quot;. The first piles consisted of a uranium-graphite lattice, consisting of 288 cans, each containing 60 pounds of uranium oxide, surrounded by graphite bricks. Fermi&#x27;s goal was to determine critical mass necessary to sustain neutron generation. Fermi defined the reproduction factor k for assessing the chain reaction, with a value of 1.0 denoting a sustained chain reaction. In September 1941, Fermi&#x27;s team was only able to achieve a k value of 0.87. In April 1942, before the project was centralized in Chicago, they had achieved 0.918 by removing moisture from the oxide. In May 1942, Fermi planned a full-scale chain reacting pile, Chicago Pile-1, after one of the exponential piles at Stagg Field reached a k of 0.995. Between 15 September and 15 November, Herbert L. Anderson and Walter Zinn built sixteen exponential piles. Acquisition of purer forms of graphite, without traces of boron and its large cross section, became paramount. Also important was the acquisition of highly purified forms of oxide from Mallinckrodt Chemical Works. Finally, acquiring pure uranium metal from the Ames process, meant the replacement of oxide pseudospheres with Frank Spedding&#x27;s &quot;eggs&quot;. Starting on 16 November 1942, Fermi had Anderson and Zinn working in two twelve-hours shifts, constructing a pile that eventually reached 57 layers by 1 Dec. The final pile consisted of 771,000 pounds of graphite, 80,590 pounds of uranium oxide, and 12,400 pounds of uranium metal, with ten cadmium control rods. Neutron intensity was measured with a boron trifluoride counter, with the control rods removed, after the end of each shift. On 2 Dec. 1942, with k approaching 1.0, Fermi had all but one of the control rod removed, and gradually removed the last one. The neutron counter clicks increased, as did the pen recorder, when Fermi announced &quot;The pile has gone critical.&quot; They had achieved a k of 1.0006, which meant neutron intensity doubled every two minutes, in addition to breeding plutonium.

===Manhattan Project and beyond===

In the United States, an all-out effort for making atomic weapons was begun in late 1942. This work was taken over by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1943, and known as the Manhattan Engineer District. The top-secret Manhattan Project, as it was colloquially known, was led by General Leslie R. Groves. Among the project&#x27;s dozens of sites were: Hanford Site in Washington, which had the first industrial-scale nuclear reactors and produced plutonium; Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which was primarily concerned with uranium enrichment; and Los Alamos, in New Mexico, which was the scientific hub for research on bomb development and design. Other sites, notably the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory and the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago, played important contributing roles. Overall scientific direction of the project was managed by the physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer.

In July 1945, the first atomic explosive device, dubbed &quot;The Gadget&quot;, was detonated in the New Mexico desert in the Trinity test. It was fueled by plutonium created at Hanford. In August 1945, two more atomic devices – &quot;Little Boy&quot;, a uranium-235 bomb, and &quot;Fat Man&quot;, a plutonium bomb – were used against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

===Natural fission chain-reactors on Earth===
Criticality in nature is uncommon. At three ore deposits at Oklo in Gabon, sixteen sites (the so-called Oklo Fossil Reactors) have been discovered at which self-sustaining nuclear fission took place approximately 2 billion years ago. French physicist Francis Perrin discovered the Oklo Fossil Reactors in 1972, but it was postulated by Paul Kuroda in 1956. Large-scale natural uranium fission chain reactions, moderated by normal water, had occurred far in the past and would not be possible now. This ancient process was able to use normal water as a moderator only because 2 billion years before the present, natural uranium was richer in the shorter-lived fissile isotope 235U (about 3%), than natural uranium available today (which is only 0.7%, and must be enriched to 3% to be usable in light-water reactors).

<text>Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman (; born Neil Richard Gaiman; 10 November 1960) is an English author of short fiction, novels, comic books, audio theatre, and screenplays. His works include the comic series &quot;The Sandman&quot; (1989–1996) and the novels &quot;Good Omens&quot; (1990), &quot;Stardust&quot; (1999), &quot;American Gods&quot; (2001), &quot;Coraline&quot; (2002), &quot;Anansi Boys&quot; (2005), &quot;The Graveyard Book&quot; (2008) and &quot;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&quot; (2013). He co-created the TV adaptations of &quot;Good Omens&quot; and &quot;The Sandman&quot;.

Gaiman&#x27;s awards include Hugo, Nebula, and Bram Stoker awards and Newbery and Carnegie medals. He is the first author to win the Newbery and the Carnegie medals for the same work, &quot;The Graveyard Book&quot;. &quot;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&quot; was voted Book of the Year in the British National Book Awards, and it was adapted into an acclaimed stage play at the Royal National Theatre in London.

Beginning in 2024, news outlets published sexual assault accusations against Gaiman by numerous women. This affected or halted production on several adaptations of his work. One accuser sued Gaiman and his estranged wife Amanda Palmer for rape and human trafficking.

==Early life and education ==
Neil Richard Gaiman was born on 10 November 1960 in Portchester, Hampshire. Gaiman&#x27;s family is of Polish-Jewish and other Ashkenazi origins. His great-grandfather emigrated to England from Antwerp before 1914 and his grandfather settled in Portsmouth and established a chain of grocery stores, changing the family name from Chaiman to Gaiman. His father, David Bernard Gaiman, worked in the same chain of stores; his mother, Sheila Gaiman (née Goldman), was a pharmacist. Neil has two younger sisters, Claire and Lizzy.

The Gaimans moved in 1965 to the West Sussex town of East Grinstead, where his parents studied Dianetics at the Scientology centre in the town; one of Gaiman&#x27;s sisters works for the Church of Scientology in Los Angeles. His other sister, Lizzy Calcioli, has said, &quot;Most of our social activities were involved with Scientology or our Jewish family. It would get very confusing when people would ask my religion as a kid. I&#x27;d say, &#x27;I&#x27;m a Jewish Scientologist. Gaiman says that he is not a Scientologist, and that like Judaism, Scientology is his family&#x27;s religion. About his personal views, Gaiman has stated, &quot;I think we can say that God exists in the DC Universe. I would not stand up and beat the drum for the existence of God in this universe. I don&#x27;t know, I think there&#x27;s probably a 50/50 chance. It doesn&#x27;t really matter to me.&quot;

Gaiman was able to read at the age of four. He said, &quot;I was a reader. I loved reading. Reading things gave me pleasure. I was very good at most subjects in school, not because I had any particular aptitude in them, but because normally on the first day of school, they&#x27;d hand out schoolbooks, and I&#x27;d read them—which would mean that I&#x27;d know what was coming up because I&#x27;d read it.&quot; When he was about 10 years old, he read his way through the works of Dennis Wheatley; &quot;The Ka of Gifford Hillary&quot; and &quot;The Haunting of Toby Jugg&quot; made a special impact on him.

Another work that made a particular impression was J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, which he got from his school library. Although they only had the first two of the novel&#x27;s three volumes, Gaiman consistently checked them out and read them. He later won the school English prize and the school reading prize, enabling him to finally acquire the third volume. For his seventh birthday, Gaiman received C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;. He later recalled that &quot;I admired his use of parenthetical statements to the reader, where he would just talk to you ... I&#x27;d think, &#x27;Oh, my gosh, that is so cool! I want to do that! When I become an author, I want to be able to do things in parentheses.&#x27; I liked the power of putting things in brackets.&quot; &quot;Narnia&quot; also introduced him to literary awards, specifically the Carnegie Medal, won by the concluding volume in 1956. When Gaiman won the 2010 Medal himself, he said &quot;it had to be the most important literary award there ever was&quot; and &quot;if you can make yourself aged seven happy, you&#x27;re really doing well – it&#x27;s like writing a letter to yourself aged seven.&quot; Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; was another childhood favourite, and &quot;a favourite forever. Alice was default reading to the point where I knew it by heart.&quot; He also enjoyed Batman comics.
Gaiman was educated at several Church of England schools, including Fonthill School in East Grinstead, Ardingly College (1970–1974), and Whitgift School in Croydon (1974–1977). His father&#x27;s position as a public relations official of the Church of Scientology was the cause of the seven-year-old Gaiman being forced to withdraw from Fonthill School and return to the school which he had previously attended. He lived in East Grinstead for many years, from 1965 to 1980 and again from 1984 to 1987.

In the 1970s, he spent three years as an auditor for the Church of Scientology, an unusually high-ranking position given his age. He also sang in a punk rock band Ex Execs, formerly called Chaos.

He met his first wife, Mary McGrath, while she was studying Scientology and living in a house in East Grinstead that was owned by his father. The couple were married in 1985 after having their first child.

==Career==
===Journalism, early writings, and literary influences===
Gaiman has mentioned several writers who have influenced his work, including Mary Shelley, Rudyard Kipling, Edgar Allan Poe, Michael Moorcock, Dave Sim, Alan Moore, Steve Ditko, Will Eisner, Ursula K. Le Guin, Harlan Ellison, John Crowley, Lord Dunsany, G. K. Chesterton and Gene Wolfe. A lifetime fan of the Monty Python comedy troupe, he owned a copy of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Big Red Book&quot; as a teenager. During a trip to France when he was 13, Gaiman became fascinated with the visually fantastic world in the stories of &quot;Metal Hurlant&quot;, even though he could not understand the words. When he was 19 or 20 years old, he contacted his favourite science fiction writer, R. A. Lafferty, requesting advice on becoming an author and including a Lafferty pastiche he had written. Lafferty sent Gaiman an encouraging and informative letter back, along with literary advice.

Gaiman has named Roger Zelazny as the author who influenced him the most. Gaiman claims that other authors such as Samuel R. Delany and Angela Carter &quot;furnished the inside of my mind and set me to writing&quot;. Gaiman takes inspiration from the folk tales tradition, citing Otta F Swire&#x27;s book on the legends of the Isle of Skye as his inspiration for &quot;The Truth Is a Cave in the Black Mountains&quot;.

In the early 1980s, Gaiman pursued journalism, conducting interviews and writing book reviews, as a means to learn about the world and to make connections that he hoped would later assist him in getting published. He wrote and reviewed extensively for the British Fantasy Society. His first professional short story publication was &quot;Featherquest&quot;, a fantasy story, in &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine in May 1984.

While waiting for a train at London&#x27;s Victoria Station in 1984, Gaiman noticed a copy of &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; by Alan Moore, and read it. Moore&#x27;s approach to comics had such an impact on Gaiman that he later wrote &quot;that was the final straw, what was left of my resistance crumbled. I proceeded to make regular and frequent visits to London&#x27;s Forbidden Planet shop to buy comics&quot;.

In 1984, he wrote his first book, a biography of the band Duran Duran, and co-edited &quot;Ghastly Beyond Belief&quot;, a book of quotations, with Kim Newman. Although Gaiman thought he had done a terrible job, the book&#x27;s first edition sold out very quickly. When he went to relinquish his rights to the book, he discovered the publisher had gone bankrupt. After this, he was offered a job by &quot;Penthouse&quot;. He refused the offer.

He also wrote interviews and articles for many British magazines, including &quot;Knave.&quot; During this, he sometimes wrote under pseudonyms, including Gerry Musgrave, Richard Grey, and &quot;a couple of house names&quot;. Gaiman has said he ended his journalism career in 1987 because British newspapers regularly publish untruths as fact.
In the late 1980s, he wrote &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic: The Official Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy Companion&quot; in what he calls a &quot;classic English humour&quot; style.

Following this, he wrote the opening of what became his collaboration with Terry Pratchett on the comic novel &quot;Good Omens&quot;, about the impending apocalypse.

===Comics===
After forming a friendship with Alan Moore, who taught him how to write comic scripts, Gaiman started writing comic books and picked up &quot;Miracleman&quot; after Moore finished his run on the series. He continued his professional relationship with Moore by contributing quotations for the supplemental materials in the &quot;Watchmen&quot; comic book series.

Gaiman and artist Mark Buckingham collaborated on several issues of the series before its publisher, Eclipse Comics, collapsed, leaving the series unfinished. His first published comic strips were four short &quot;Future Shocks&quot; for &quot;2000 AD&quot; in 1986–87. He wrote three graphic novels with his favourite collaborator and long-time friend Dave McKean: &quot;Violent Cases&quot;, &quot;Signal to Noise&quot;, and &quot;The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch&quot;. Impressed with his work, DC Comics hired him in February 1987, and he wrote the limited series &quot;Black Orchid&quot;. Karen Berger, who later became head of DC Comics&#x27;s Vertigo, read &quot;Black Orchid&quot; and offered Gaiman a job: to re-write an old character, the Sandman, but to put his own spin on him.

&quot;The Sandman&quot; tells the tale of the ageless, anthropomorphic personification of Dream that is known by many names, including Morpheus. The series began in January 1989 and concluded in March 1996. The various artists who contributed to the series include Sam Kieth, Mike Dringenberg, Jill Thompson, Shawn McManus, Marc Hempel, and Michael Zulli, with lettering by Todd Klein, colours by Daniel Vozzo, and covers by Dave McKean. The series became one of DC&#x27;s top selling titles, eclipsing even &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot;. The 75 issues of the regular series, along with an illustrated prose text and a special containing seven short stories, have been collected into 12 volumes that remain in print.

In the eighth issue of &quot;The Sandman&quot;, Gaiman and artist Mike Dringenberg introduced Death, the older sister of Dream, who became as popular as the series&#x27; title character. The limited series &quot;&quot; launched DC&#x27;s Vertigo line in 1993.

Comics historian Les Daniels called Gaiman&#x27;s work &quot;astonishing&quot; and noted that &quot;The Sandman&quot; was &quot;a mixture of fantasy, horror, and ironic humor such as comic books had never seen before&quot;. DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that &quot;&quot;The Sandman&quot; became the first extraordinary success as a series of graphic novel collections, reaching out and converting new readers to the medium, particularly young women on college campuses, and making Gaiman himself into an iconic cultural figure.&quot;

Gaiman and Jamie Delano were to become co-writers of the &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; series following Rick Veitch. An editorial decision by DC to censor Veitch&#x27;s final storyline caused both Gaiman and Delano to withdraw from the title.

Gaiman produced two stories for DC&#x27;s &quot;Secret Origins&quot; series in 1989: a Poison Ivy tale drawn by Mark Buckingham and a Riddler story illustrated by Bernie Mireault and Matt Wagner. A story that Gaiman originally wrote for &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot; in 1989 was shelved due to editorial concerns but it was finally published in 2000 as &quot;Green Lantern/Superman: Legend of the Green Flame&quot;.

In 1990, Gaiman wrote &quot;The Books of Magic&quot;, a four-part mini-series that provided a tour of the mythological and magical parts of the DC Universe through a frame story about an English teenager who discovers that he is destined to be the world&#x27;s greatest wizard. The miniseries was popular, and sired an ongoing series written by John Ney Rieber.

Gaiman&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;, illustrated by Michael Zulli for Stephen R. Bissette&#x27;s publication &quot;Taboo&quot;, was stopped when the anthology itself was discontinued.

In the mid-1990s, he also created a number of new characters and a setting that was to be featured in a title published by Tekno Comix. The concepts were then altered and split between three titles set in the same continuity: &quot;Lady Justice&quot;, &quot;Mr. Hero the Newmatic Man&quot;, and &quot;Teknophage&quot;, and tie-ins. Although Gaiman&#x27;s name appeared prominently as the creator of the characters, he was not involved in writing any of the above-mentioned books.

Gaiman wrote a semi-autobiographical story about a boy&#x27;s fascination with Michael Moorcock&#x27;s anti-hero Elric of Melniboné for Ed Kramer&#x27;s anthology &quot;Tales of the White Wolf.&quot; In 1996, Gaiman and Kramer co-edited &quot;The Sandman: Book of Dreams&quot;. Nominated for the British Fantasy Award, the original fiction anthology featured stories and contributions by Tori Amos, Clive Barker, Gene Wolfe, Caitlín R. Kiernan, Tad Williams, and others.

Asked why he likes comics more than other forms of storytelling, Gaiman said: 

Gaiman wrote two series for Marvel Comics. &quot;Marvel 1602&quot; was an eight-issue limited series published from November 2003 to June 2004 with art by Andy Kubert and Richard Isanove. &quot;The Eternals&quot; was a seven-issue limited series drawn by John Romita Jr., which was published from August 2006 to March 2007.

In 2009, Gaiman wrote a two-part Batman story for DC Comics to follow &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot; titled &quot;&quot; a play-off of the classic Superman story &quot;&quot; by Alan Moore. He contributed a twelve-part Metamorpho serial drawn by Mike Allred for &quot;Wednesday Comics&quot;, a weekly newspaper-style series. Gaiman and Paul Cornell co-wrote &quot;Action Comics&quot; #894 (December 2010), which featured an appearance by Death. In October 2013, DC Comics released &quot;The Sandman: Overture&quot; with art by J. H. Williams III. Gaiman&#x27;s Angela character was introduced into the Marvel Universe in the last issue of the &quot;Age of Ultron&quot; miniseries in 2013.

Gaiman oversaw &quot;The Sandman Universe&quot;, a line of comic books published by Vertigo. The four series — &quot;House of Whispers&quot;, &quot;Lucifer&quot;, &quot;The Books of Magic&quot;, and &quot;The Dreaming&quot; — were written by new creative teams. The line launched on 8 August 2018.

After teaming with Colleen Doran for a series of graphic novel adaptations based on his short stories &quot;Troll Bridge&quot;, &quot;Chivalry&quot;, and &quot;Snow, Glass, Apples&quot;, Gaiman and the Terry Pratchett estate chose Doran to adapt &quot;Good Omens&quot; into graphic novel form, and to self publish the work via the Pratchett estate&#x27;s Dunmanifestin label. It was financed on Kickstarter where it became a record-setter in less than a week as the top fan-supported and top-earning comics project in the history of the platform.

===Novels===

In a collaboration with author Terry Pratchett, best known for his series of &quot;Discworld&quot; novels, Gaiman&#x27;s first novel &quot;Good Omens&quot; was published in 1990. In 2011, Pratchett said that while the entire novel was a collaborative effort and most of the ideas could be credited to both of them, Pratchett did a larger portion of writing and editing if for no other reason than Gaiman&#x27;s scheduled involvement with &quot;Sandman&quot;.

The 1996 novelisation of Gaiman&#x27;s teleplay for the BBC mini-series &quot;Neverwhere&quot; was his first solo novel. The novel was released in tandem with the television series, though it presents some notable differences from the television series. Gaiman has since revised the novel twice, the first time for an American audience unfamiliar with the London Underground, the second time because he felt unsatisfied with the originals.

In 1999, the first printings of his fantasy novel &quot;Stardust&quot; were released. The novel has been released both as a standard novel and in an illustrated text edition. This novel was highly influenced by Victorian fairytales and culture.

&quot;American Gods&quot; became one of Gaiman&#x27;s best-selling and multi-award-winning novels upon its release in 2001. A special 10th Anniversary edition was released, with the &quot;author&#x27;s preferred text&quot; 12,000 words longer than the original mass-market editions. Gaiman has not written a direct sequel to &quot;American Gods&quot; but he has revisited the characters. A glimpse at Shadow&#x27;s travels in Europe is found in a short story which finds him in Scotland, applying the same concepts developed in &quot;American Gods&quot; to the story of &quot;Beowulf&quot;. The 2005 novel &quot;Anansi Boys&quot; deals with Anansi (&#x27;Mr. Nancy&#x27;), tracing the relationship of his two sons, one semi-divine and the other an unassuming bookkeeper, as they explore their common heritage. It debuted at number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

In 2002, Gaiman entered the world of children&#x27;s books with the dark fairy tale &quot;Coraline&quot;. In 2008 he released a young adult novel, &quot;The Graveyard Book&quot;. It follows the adventures of a boy named Bod after his family is murdered and he is left to be brought up by a graveyard. It is heavily influenced by Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; and H. P. Lovecraft’s &quot;The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath&quot;. Literary critic Danel Olson defended it as one of the first canonical novels of 21st century Gothic literature. , it had been on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Bestseller children&#x27;s list for fifteen weeks.

In 2013, &quot;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&quot; was voted Book of the Year in the British National Book Awards. The novel follows an unnamed man who returns to his hometown for a funeral and remembers events that began forty years earlier. Themes include the search for self-identity and the &quot;disconnect between childhood and adulthood&quot;. It was later adapted into a critically acclaimed stage play at the Royal National Theatre in London.

In September 2016, Neil Gaiman announced that he had been working for some years on retellings of Norse mythology. &quot;Norse Mythology&quot; was released in February 2017.

Several of his novels have been published as paperbacks with retro covers by artist Robert McGinnis.

===Film and screenwriting===

Gaiman wrote the 1996 BBC dark fantasy television series &quot;Neverwhere&quot;. He co-wrote the screenplay for the movie &quot;MirrorMask&quot; with his old friend Dave McKean for McKean to direct. In addition, he wrote the localised English language script for the anime movie &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;, based on a translation of the Japanese script.

After his disappointment with the production limitations of &quot;Neverwhere&quot;, Gaiman asked his agent to pull him out of an (unnamed) UK television series that was to begin production immediately afterwards. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to do it unless I had more control than you get as a writer: in fantasy, the tone of voice, the look and feel, the way something is shot and edited is vital, and I wanted to be in charge of that.&quot;

He co-wrote the script for Robert Zemeckis&#x27;s &quot;Beowulf&quot; with Roger Avary, a collaboration that has proved productive for both writers. Gaiman has expressed interest in collaborating on a film adaptation of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;.
He was the only person other than J. Michael Straczynski to write a &quot;Babylon 5&quot; script in the series&#x27; last three seasons, contributing to the season five episode &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;. The series also features a recurring alien race called the Gaim, who resemble the character of Dream and are named after Gaiman.

Gaiman has also written at least three drafts of a screenplay adaptation of Nicholson Baker&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fermata&quot; for director Robert Zemeckis, although the project was stalled while Zemeckis made &quot;The Polar Express&quot; and the Gaiman-Roger Avary-penned &quot;Beowulf&quot; film.

Neil Gaiman was featured in the History Channel documentary &quot;Comic Book Superheroes Unmasked&quot;.

Several of Gaiman&#x27;s original works have been optioned or greenlighted for film adaptation, most notably &quot;Stardust&quot;, which premiered in August 2007 and stars Charlie Cox, Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Claire Danes and Mark Strong, directed by Matthew Vaughn. A stop-motion version of &quot;Coraline&quot; was released on 6 February 2009, directed by Henry Selick and starring the voices of Dakota Fanning and Teri Hatcher.

In 2007, Gaiman announced that after ten years in development, the feature film of &quot;&quot; would finally begin production with a screenplay by Gaiman that he would direct for Warner Independent. Gaiman said that he agreed to direct the film &quot;with the carrot dangled in front of me that I could direct it. And we&#x27;ll see if that happens, and if I&#x27;m a good director or not.&quot; Don Murphy and Susan Montford were named as producers, and Guillermo del Toro was named as the film&#x27;s executive producer. By 2010, it had been reported that the film was no longer in production.

Seeing Ear Theatre performed two of Gaiman&#x27;s audio theatre plays, &quot;Snow, Glass, Apples&quot;, Gaiman&#x27;s retelling of Snow White, and &quot;Murder Mysteries&quot;, a story of heaven before the Fall in which the first crime is committed. Both audio plays were published in the collection &quot;Smoke and Mirrors&quot; in 1998.

At Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s request, he rewrote the opening of &quot;Hellboy II: The Golden Army&quot; to make it look more like a fairy tale.

Gaiman&#x27;s 2009 Newbery Medal winning book &quot;The Graveyard Book&quot; will be made into a movie, with Ron Howard as the director.

Gaiman wrote an episode of the long-running BBC science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, broadcast in 2011 during Matt Smith&#x27;s second series as the Doctor. Shooting began in August 2010 for this episode, the original title of which was &quot;The House of Nothing&quot; but which was eventually transmitted as &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Wife&quot;. The episode won the 2012 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form). Gaiman made his return to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; with an episode titled &quot;Nightmare in Silver&quot;, broadcast on 11 May 2013.
Gaiman returned to the Whoniverse in 2020 for the web series &quot;Doctor Who: Lockdown&quot;; he wrote the mini-episode &quot;Rory&#x27;s Story&quot; which saw Arthur Darvill reprise his role of Rory Williams. Also in 2011, it was announced that Gaiman would be writing the script to a new film version of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. Gaiman appeared as himself on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Book Job&quot;, which was broadcast on 20 November 2011.

In 2015, Starz greenlighted a series adaptation of Gaiman&#x27;s novel &quot;American Gods&quot;. Bryan Fuller and Michael Green wrote and were showrunners for the series. Gaiman received a Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form Hugo Award in 2020 for the TV miniseries adaptation of &quot;Good Omens&quot;, for which he wrote the screenplay. He voiced Gef in the black comedy film &quot;Nandor Fodor and the Talking Mongoose&quot;, one of the film&#x27;s titular characters, in 2023.

===Radio===
A six-part radio play of &quot;Neverwhere&quot; was broadcast in March 2013, adapted by Dirk Maggs for BBC Radio 4 and Radio 4 Extra. The performance featured James McAvoy as Richard, Natalie Dormer, Benedict Cumberbatch, Christopher Lee, Bernard Cribbens, and Johnny Vegas.

In September 2014, Gaiman and Terry Pratchett joined forces with BBC Radio 4 to make the first-ever dramatisation of their co-penned novel &quot;Good Omens&quot;, which was broadcast in December in five half-hour episodes and culminated in an hour-long final apocalyptic showdown. In 2021, Gaiman was cast as Duke Aubrey in an adaptation of Hope Mirrlees&#x27; &quot;Lud-in-the-Mist&quot;, a novel Gaiman had previously proclaimed one of his favourites (and to which he had contributed a foreword for an edition by Cold Spring Press), for BBC Radio 4.

===Public performances===
Gaiman frequently performs public readings from his stories and poetry, and has toured with his wife, musician Amanda Palmer. In some of these performances he has also sung songs, in &quot;a novelist&#x27;s version of singing&quot;, despite having &quot;no kind of singing voice&quot;.

In 2015, Gaiman delivered a 100-minute lecture for the Long Now Foundation entitled &quot;How Stories Last&quot; about the nature of storytelling and how stories persist in human culture. In April 2018, Gaiman made a guest appearance on the television show &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, and his tweet about the show&#x27;s fictional comic book store became the central theme of the episode &quot;The Comet Polarization&quot;.

===Intellectual property disputes===
In 1993, Gaiman was contracted by Todd McFarlane to write a single issue of &quot;Spawn&quot;, for Image Comics, which McFarlane had recently co-founded. McFarlane was promoting his new title by having guest authors Gaiman, Alan Moore, Frank Miller, and Dave Sim each write a single issue.

In issue No. 9 of the series, Gaiman introduced the characters Angela, Cogliostro, and Medieval Spawn. Prior to this issue, Spawn was an assassin who worked for the government and came back as a reluctant agent of Hell but had no real direction in his actions. In Angela, a cruel and malicious angel, Gaiman introduced a character who threatened Spawn&#x27;s existence, as well as providing a moral opposite. Cogliostro was introduced as a mentor character for exposition and instruction, providing guidance. Medieval Spawn introduced a history and precedent that not all Spawns were self-serving or evil, giving additional character development to Malebolgia, the demon that creates Hellspawn.

As intended, all three characters were used repeatedly throughout the next decade by Todd McFarlane within the wider &quot;Spawn&quot; universe. In papers filed by Gaiman in early 2002, however, he claimed that the characters were jointly owned by their scripter (himself) and artist (McFarlane), not merely by McFarlane in his role as the creator of the series. Disagreement over who owned the rights to a character was the primary motivation for McFarlane and other artists to form Image Comics (although that argument related more towards disagreements between writers and artists as character creators). As McFarlane used the characters without Gaiman&#x27;s permission or royalty payments, Gaiman believed his copyrighted work was being infringed upon, which violated their original oral agreement. McFarlane initially agreed that Gaiman had not signed away any rights to the characters, and negotiated with Gaiman to effectively &quot;swap&quot; McFarlane&#x27;s interest in the character Marvelman. McFarlane had purchased an interest in the character when Eclipse Comics was liquidated while Gaiman was interested in being able to continue his aborted run of the Marvelman title. McFarlane later changed his initial position, claiming that Gaiman&#x27;s work had only been work-for-hire and that McFarlane owned all of Gaiman&#x27;s creations entirely. The presiding judge, however, ruled against their agreement being work for hire, based in large part on the legal requirement that &quot;copyright assignments must be in writing.&quot;

The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court ruling in February 2004 granting joint ownership of the characters to Gaiman and McFarlane. On the specific issue of Cogliostro, presiding Judge John C. Shabaz proclaimed, &quot;The expressive work that is the comic-book character Count Nicholas Cogliostro was the joint work of Gaiman and McFarlane—their contributions strike us as quite equal—and both are entitled to ownership of the copyright&quot;. Similar analysis led to similar results for the other two characters, Angela and Medieval Spawn.

This legal battle was brought by Gaiman and the specifically formed Marvels and Miracles, LLC, which Gaiman had previously created to help sort out the legal rights surrounding Marvelman. Gaiman had written &quot;Marvel 1602 &quot;in 2003 to help fund this project and all of Gaiman&#x27;s profits for the original issues of the series were donated to Marvels and Miracles. The rights to Marvelman were subsequently purchased, from original creator Mick Anglo, by Marvel Comics in 2009.

Gaiman returned to court again over the &quot;Spawn&quot; characters Dark Ages Spawn, Domina, and Tiffany, claiming that they were &quot;derivative of the three he co-created with McFarlane.&quot; The judge ruled that Gaiman was right in these claims as well and gave McFarlane until the beginning of September 2010 to settle the matter.

==Personal life==

Gaiman moved near Menomonie, Wisconsin, in 1992 to be closer to the family of his then-wife, Mary McGrath, with whom he has three children. Gaiman has also lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was close friends with fellow author Terry Pratchett until the latter&#x27;s death in 2015. Gaiman met Amanda Palmer in 2008, and the two entered a relationship in 2009, marrying in 2011. They have one son together. The two had an open marriage, and encouraged one another to have affairs, including with fans of their work. 

Gaiman, Palmer and their son moved to New Zealand in March 2020. Weeks later, their marriage collapsed and Gaiman left the country, travelling from New Zealand to his holiday home on the Isle of Skye, which broke COVID-19 lockdown rules. Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP Ian Blackford described Gaiman&#x27;s behaviour as unacceptable and dangerous. Gaiman published an apology on his website, saying he had endangered the local community. After Gaiman&#x27;s departure, Palmer announced on Patreon that she and Gaiman had separated. Gaiman stated the split was &quot;my fault, I&#x27;m afraid&quot;, and requested privacy. The couple later released a joint statement clarifying that they were not getting divorced, reconciled in 2021, but confirmed they would divorce in a November 2022 joint statement. , in the fifth year of proceedings, negotiations had become &quot;ugly&quot;, with Palmer moving in with her parents due to financial difficulties.

===Sexual assault and misconduct allegations===
In July 2024, five women accused Gaiman of sexual assault and abuse. All five were interviewed on the Tortoise Media podcast &quot;Master: The Allegations Against Neil Gaiman&quot;. One, using the pseudonym &quot;Claire&quot;, was also interviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Claire described non-consensual kissing and groping by Gaiman after meeting him at a book tour event, with Gaiman making a $60,000 payment to her in August 2022. A woman identified as &quot;K&quot;, who also first met Gaiman at a book signing, said that during their relationship he subjected her to painful sex that she &quot;neither wanted nor enjoyed&quot;.

Scarlett Pavlovich, a former nanny for Gaiman and Palmer&#x27;s child, alleges that Gaiman sexually assaulted her within hours of their first meeting in February 2022. Pavlovich recalled that he said &quot;Amanda told me I couldn&#x27;t have you&quot; after the assault; according to one of Palmer&#x27;s friends, Palmer had previously told Gaiman &quot;You could really hurt this person and break her; keep your hands off of her&quot;. She said that Gaiman had anal sex with her in the presence of his son. 

A former tenant of Gaiman&#x27;s named Caroline Wallner alleges that he demanded sexual favours in exchange for being allowed to continue living on his property. Wallner says that on one occasion Gaiman grabbed her hand and placed it on his penis while his young son was asleep in the same bed.

The writer Julia Hobsbawm accused Gaiman of &quot;an aggressive, unwanted pass&quot; and described how Gaiman pushed her onto a sofa and French kissed her in 1986.

In September 2024, Disney halted production on the film adaptation of &quot;The Graveyard Book&quot; due to a variety of factors, including the sexual assault allegations against Gaiman. That same month, production on season three of &quot;Good Omens&quot; was put on hold; Gaiman ultimately left the project in October.

In January 2025, &quot;New York&quot; magazine published a cover story detailing the allegations against Gaiman. This article, which was published online on &quot;Vulture&quot;, included interviews with four of the women who had previously spoken to Tortoise Media, as well as four more women. Later the same month, Dark Horse Comics announced that they would cut ties with Gaiman over the allegations, including cancelling his ongoing comic adaptation of &quot;Anansi Boys&quot;. A week later, Netflix announced that &quot;The Sandman&quot; was canceled, with the series set to conclude with its second season. Gaiman was also dropped as a client by his agent Casarotto Ramsay.

In February 2025, Scarlett Pavlovich filed three federal lawsuits that alleged human trafficking under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, alongside formal allegations of sexual assault and coercion. One named Gaiman and Palmer as co-defendants and two were against Palmer alone, seeking at least US$7 million in damages. 

Gaiman has denied engaging in non-consensual sex, and dismissed Hobsbawm&#x27;s allegations as his misreading a situation. Gaiman&#x27;s representatives claim that Wallner initiated their sexual encounters and that none of these occurred in the presence of Gaiman&#x27;s child. In a blog post responding to coverage of the allegations against him, Gaiman said there were &quot;moments I half-recognise and moments I don&#x27;t&quot;. He denies engaging in any non-consensual sexual activity, but said he could have &quot;done so much better&quot; and was &quot;trying to do the work needed&quot;.

===Blog and social media===
In February 2001, when Gaiman had completed writing &quot;American Gods&quot;, his publishers set up a promotional website featuring a weblog in which Gaiman described the day-to-day process of revising, publishing, and promoting the novel. After the novel was published, the website evolved into a more general Official Neil Gaiman Website. Gaiman generally posts to the blog describing the day-to-day process of being Neil Gaiman and writing, revising, publishing, or promoting whatever the current project is. He also posts reader emails and answers questions, which gives him unusually direct and immediate interaction with fans. One of his answers on why he writes the blog is &quot;because writing is, like death, a lonely business.&quot; The original &quot;American Gods&quot; blog was extracted for publication in the NESFA Press collection of Gaiman miscellany, &quot;Adventures in the Dream Trade&quot;. To celebrate the seventh anniversary of the blog, the novel &quot;American Gods&quot; was provided free of charge online for a month.

Gaiman joined Twitter in 2008. In 2013, Gaiman was named by &quot;IGN&quot; as one of &quot;The Best Tweeters in Comics&quot;, describing his posts as &quot;sublime&quot;.

=== Other personal relationships ===
Gaiman is godfather to Tori Amos&#x27;s daughter Tash, and wrote a poem called &quot;Blueberry Girl&quot; for Tori and Tash. The poem was adapted into a book by illustrator Charles Vess. Gaiman read the poem aloud to an audience at the Sundance Kabuki Theater in San Francisco on 5 October 2008 during his book reading tour for &quot;The Graveyard Book&quot;. It was published in March 2009 with the title &quot;Blueberry Girl&quot;.

===Advocacy===
In 2016, Gaiman, as well as several celebrities, appeared in the video &quot;What They Took With Them&quot;, from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to help raise awareness of the issue of global refugees.

Gaiman is a supporter of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund and has served on its board of directors. In 2013, Gaiman was named co-chair of the organization&#x27;s newly formed advisory board.

In 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Gaiman supported Ukraine by announcing on Twitter that he does not want to renew contracts with Russian publishers. Gaiman also encouraged donating to Ukrainian refugees.

In 2023, Gaiman signed an open letter addressed to Russian president Vladimir Putin, alongside over 100 other public figures, calling for the release of Russian prisoner Alexei Navalny.

==Literary allusions==
Gaiman&#x27;s work is known for its use of allusions. Meredith Collins, for instance, has commented upon the degree to which his novel &quot;Stardust&quot; depends on allusions to Victorian fairy tales and culture. In &quot;The Sandman&quot;, literary figures and characters appear often; the character of Fiddler&#x27;s Green is modeled on G. K. Chesterton, and both William Shakespeare and Geoffrey Chaucer appear as characters, as do several characters from &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and &quot;The Tempest&quot;. The comic also draws from numerous mythologies.

Analyzing Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Graveyard Book&quot;, bibliographer and librarian Richard Bleiler detects patterns of and allusions to the Gothic novel, from Horace Walpole&#x27;s &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; to Shirley Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot;. He concludes that Gaiman is &quot;utilizing works, characters, themes, and settings that generations of scholars have identified and classified as Gothic... [yet] subverts them and develops the novel by focusing on the positive aspects of maturation, concentrating on the values of learning, friendship, and sacrifice.&quot; Regarding another work&#x27;s assumed connection and allusions to this form, Gaiman himself quipped: &quot;I&#x27;ve never been able to figure out whether &quot;Sandman&quot; is a gothic.&quot;

Clay Smith has argued that this sort of allusiveness serves to situate Gaiman as a strong authorial presence in his own works, often to the exclusion of his collaborators. However, Smith&#x27;s viewpoint is in the minority: to many, if there is a problem with Gaiman&#x27;s scholarship and intertextuality it is that &quot;... his literary merit and vast popularity have propelled him into the nascent comics canon so quickly that there is not yet a basis of critical scholarship about his work.&quot;

David Rudd takes a more generous view in his study of the novel &quot;Coraline&quot;, where he argues that the work plays and riffs productively on Sigmund Freud&#x27;s concept of &quot;Unheimlich&quot; (&quot;the Uncanny&quot;).

Though Gaiman&#x27;s work is frequently seen as exemplifying the monomyth structure laid out in Joseph Campbell&#x27;s &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot;, Gaiman says that he started reading &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; but refused to finish it: &quot;I think I got about halfway through &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; and found myself thinking if this is true – I don&#x27;t want to know. I really would rather not know this stuff. I&#x27;d rather do it because it&#x27;s true and because I accidentally wind up creating something that falls into this pattern than be told what the pattern is.&quot;

<doc id="22058" wikidata="Q373916" url="?curid=22058" title="Nymph">
<text>A nymph (; ; sometimes spelled nymphe) is a minor female nature deity in ancient Greek folklore. Distinct from other Greek goddesses, nymphs are generally regarded as personifications of nature; they are typically tied to a specific place, landform, or tree, and are usually depicted as maidens. Because of their association with springs, they were often seen as having healing properties; other divine powers of the nymphs included divination and shapeshifting. In spite of their divine nature, they were not immortal.

Nymphs are divided into various broad subgroups based on their habitat, such as the Meliae (ash tree nymphs), the Dryads (oak tree nymphs), the Alseids (grove nymphs), the Naiads (spring nymphs), the Nereids (sea nymphs), the Oceanids (ocean nymphs), the Oreads (mountain nymphs), and the Epimeliads (apple tree and flock nymphs). Other nymphs included the Hesperides (evening nymphs), the Hyades (rain nymphs), and the Pleiades (companions of Artemis).

Nymphs featured in classic works of art, literature, and mythology. They are often attendants of goddesses and frequently occur in myths with a love motif, being the lovers of heroes and other deities. Desirable and promiscuous, nymphs can rarely be fully domesticated, being often aggressive to their mortal affairs. Since the Middle Ages, nymphs have been sometimes popularly associated or even confused with fairies.

==Etymology==
The Greek word has the primary meaning of &quot;young woman; bride, young wife&quot; but is not usually associated with deities in particular. Yet the etymology of the noun remains uncertain. The Doric and Aeolic (Homeric) form is ().

Modern usage more often applies to young women, contrasting with &quot;parthenos&quot; () &quot;a virgin (of any age)&quot;, and generically as &quot;kore&quot; ( &lt; ) &quot;maiden, girl&quot;. The term is sometimes used by women to address each other and remains the regular Modern Greek term for &quot;bride&quot;.

==Ancient Greek mythology==

Nymphs were sometimes beloved by many and dwelt in specific areas related to the natural environment: e.g. mountainous regions; forests; springs. Other nymphs were part of the retinue of a god (such as Dionysus, Hermes, or Pan) or of a goddess (generally the huntress Artemis).

The Greek nymphs were also spirits invariably bound to places, not unlike the Latin &quot;genius loci&quot;, and sometimes this produced complicated myths like the cult of Arethusa to Sicily. In some of the works of the Greek-educated Latin poets, the nymphs gradually absorbed into their ranks the indigenous Italian divinities of springs and streams (Juturna, Egeria, Carmentis, Fontus) while the Lymphae (originally Lumpae), Italian water goddesses, owing to the accidental similarity of their names, could be identified with the Greek Nymphae. The classical mythologies of the Roman poets were unlikely to have affected the rites and cults of individual nymphs venerated by country people in the springs and clefts of Latium. Among the Roman literate class, their sphere of influence was restricted and they appear almost exclusively as divinities of the watery element.

== Greek folk religion ==
The ancient Greek belief in nymphs survived in many parts of the country into the early years of the twentieth century when they were usually known as &quot;nereids&quot;. Nymphs often tended to frequent areas distant from humans but could be encountered by lone travelers outside the village, where their music might be heard, and the traveler could spy on their dancing or bathing in a stream or pool, either during the noon heat or in the middle of the night. They might appear in a whirlwind. Such encounters could be dangerous, bringing dumbness, besotted infatuation, madness or stroke to the unfortunate man. When parents believed their child to be nereid-struck, they would pray to the Saint Artemidos (Artemis), an example of &quot;practical polytheism in the worship of the saints.&quot;

== Nymphs and fairies ==
Nymphs are often depicted in classic works across art, literature, mythology, and fiction. They are often associated with the medieval romances or Renaissance literature of the elusive fairies or elves.

== Sleeping nymph ==

A motif that entered European art during the Renaissance was the idea of a statue of a nymph sleeping in a grotto or spring. This motif supposedly came from an Italian report of a Roman sculpture of a nymph at a fountain above the River Danube. The report, and an accompanying poem supposedly on the fountain describing the sleeping nymph, are now generally concluded to be a fifteenth-century forgery, but the motif proved influential among artists and landscape gardeners for several centuries after, with copies seen at neoclassical gardens such as the grotto at Stourhead.

== List ==
All the names for various classes of nymphs have plural feminine adjectives, most agreeing with the substantive numbers and groups of nymphai. There is no single adopted classification that could be seen as canonical and exhaustive. Some classes of nymphs tend to overlap, which complicates the task of precise classification. e.g. &quot;dryads&quot; and &quot;hamadryads&quot; as nymphs of trees generally, &quot;meliai&quot; as nymphs of ash trees.

=== By dwelling or affinity ===
The following is not the authentic Greek classification, but is intended as a guide:
=== By location ===
The following is a list of individual nymphs or groups thereof associated with this or that particular location. Nymphs in such groups could belong to any of the classes mentioned above (Naiades, Oreades, and so on).
=== Others ===
The following is a selection of names of the nymphs whose class was not specified in the source texts. For lists of Naiads, Oceanids, Dryades etc., see respective articles.
===In non-Greek tales influenced by Greek mythology===

<doc id="22063" wikidata="Q29524" url="?curid=22063" title="Natural law">
<text>Natural law (, ) is a philosophical and legal theory that posits the existence of a set of inherent laws derived from nature and universal moral principles, which are discoverable through reason. In ethics, natural law theory asserts that certain rights and moral values are inherent in human nature and can be understood universally, independent of enacted laws or societal norms. In jurisprudence, natural law—sometimes referred to as iusnaturalism or jusnaturalism, but not to be confused with what is called simply &quot;naturalism&quot; in legal philosophy—holds that there are objective legal standards based on morality that underlie and inform the creation, interpretation, and application of human-made laws. This contrasts with &quot;positive law&quot; (as in legal positivism), which emphasizes that laws are rules created by human authorities and are not necessarily connected to moral principles. Natural law can refer to &quot;theories of ethics, theories of politics, theories of civil law, and theories of religious morality&quot;, depending on the context in which naturally-grounded practical principles are claimed to exist.
In Western tradition, natural law was anticipated by the pre-Socratics, for example, in their search for principles that governed the cosmos and human beings. The concept of natural law was documented in ancient Greek philosophy, including Aristotle, and was mentioned in ancient Roman philosophy by Cicero. References to it are also found in the Old and New Testaments of the Bible, and were later expounded upon in the Middle Ages by Christian philosophers such as Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas. The School of Salamanca made notable contributions during the Renaissance.

Although the central ideas of natural law had been part of Christian thought since the Roman Empire, its foundation as a consistent system was laid by Aquinas, who synthesized and condensed his predecessors&#x27; ideas into his (). Aquinas argues that because human beings have reason, and because reason is a spark of the divine, all human lives are sacred and of infinite value compared to any other created object, meaning everyone is fundamentally equal and bestowed with an intrinsic basic set of rights that no one can remove.

Modern natural law theory took shape in the Age of Enlightenment, combining inspiration from Roman law, Christian scholastic philosophy, and contemporary concepts such as social contract theory. It was used in challenging the theory of the divine right of kings, and became an alternative justification for the establishment of a social contract, positive law, and government—and thus legal rights—in the form of classical republicanism. John Locke was a key Enlightenment-era proponent of natural law, stressing its role in the justification of property rights and the right to revolution. In the early decades of the 21st century, the concept of natural law is closely related to the concept of natural rights and has libertarian and conservative proponents. Indeed, many philosophers, jurists and scholars use natural law synonymously with natural rights () or natural justice; others distinguish between natural law and natural right.

Some scholars point out that the concept of natural law has been used by philosophers throughout history also in a different sense from those mentioned above, e.g. for the law of the strongest, which can be observed
to hold among all members of the animal kingdom, or as the principle of self-preservation, inherent as an instinct in all living beings.

== History ==

=== Ancient Greece ===

==== Plato ====
Plato did not have an explicit theory of natural law (he rarely used the phrase &quot;natural law&quot; except in &quot;Gorgias&quot; 484 and &quot;Timaeus&quot; 83e), but his concept of nature, according to John Wild, contains some of the elements of many natural law theories. According to Plato, we live in an orderly universe. The basis of this orderly universe or nature are the forms, most fundamentally the Form of the Good, which Plato calls &quot;the brightest region of Being&quot;. The Form of the Good is the cause of all things, and a person who sees it is led to act wisely. In the &quot;Symposium&quot;, the Good is closely identified with the Beautiful, and Plato describes how Socrates&#x27;s experience of the Beautiful enabled him to resist the temptations of wealth and sex. In the &quot;Republic&quot;, the ideal community is &quot;a city which would be established in accordance with nature&quot;.

==== Aristotle ====

Greek philosophy emphasized the distinction between &quot;nature&quot; (&quot;physis&quot;, &quot;φúσις&quot;) and &quot;law&quot;, &quot;custom&quot;, or &quot;convention&quot; (&quot;nomos&quot;, &quot;νóμος&quot;). What the law commanded is expected to vary from place to place, but what is &quot;by nature&quot; should be the same everywhere. A &quot;law of nature&quot; therefore has the flavor more of a paradox than something that obviously existed. Against the conventionalism that the distinction between nature and custom could engender, Socrates and his philosophic heirs, Plato and Aristotle, posited the existence of natural justice or natural right (, , ). Of these, Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law.

Aristotle&#x27;s association with natural law may be due to Thomas Aquinas&#x27;s interpretation of his work. But whether Aquinas correctly read Aristotle is in dispute. According to some, Aquinas conflates natural law and natural right, the latter of which Aristotle posits in Book V of the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; (Book IV of the &quot;Eudemian Ethics&quot;). According to this interpretation, Aquinas&#x27;s influence was such as to affect a number of early translations of these passages in an unfortunate manner, though more recent translations render them more literally. Aristotle notes that natural justice is a species of political justice, specifically the scheme of distributive and corrective justice that would be established under the best political community; if this took the form of law, it could be called a natural law, though Aristotle does not discuss this and suggests in the &quot;Politics&quot; that the best regime may not rule by law at all.

The best evidence of Aristotle&#x27;s having thought there is a natural law is in the &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, where Aristotle notes that, aside from the &quot;particular&quot; laws that each people has set up for itself, there is a &quot;common&quot; law that is according to nature. Specifically, he quotes Sophocles and Empedocles:

Some critics believe that this remark&#x27;s context suggests only that Aristotle advised that it can be rhetorically advantageous to appeal to such a law, especially when the &quot;particular&quot; law of one&#x27;s own city is averse to the case being made, not that there actually is such a law. Moreover, they write that Aristotle considered two of the three candidates for a universally valid, natural law provided in this passage to be wrong. Aristotle&#x27;s paternity of natural law tradition is consequently disputed.

==== Stoic natural law ====
The development of this tradition of natural justice into one of natural law is usually attributed to the Stoics. The rise of natural law as a universal system coincided with the rise of large empires and kingdoms in the Greek world. Whereas the &quot;higher&quot; law that Aristotle suggested one could appeal to was emphatically natural, in contradistinction to being the result of divine positive legislation, the Stoic natural law was indifferent to either the natural or divine source of the law: the Stoics asserted the existence of a rational and purposeful order to the universe (a divine or eternal law), and the means by which a rational being lived in accordance with this order was the natural law, which inspired actions that accorded with virtue.

As the English historian A. J. Carlyle notes:

Charles H. McIlwain likewise observes that &quot;the idea of the equality of men is the most profound contribution of the Stoics to political thought&quot; and that &quot;its greatest influence is in the changed conception of law that in part resulted from it.

Natural law first appeared among the Stoics, who believed that God is everywhere and in everyone (see classical pantheism). According to this belief, there is a &quot;divine spark&quot; within us that helps us live in accordance with nature. The Stoics believed there is a way in which the universe has been designed, and that natural law helps us to harmonize with this.

=== Ancient Rome ===
In the Fifth Book of his &quot;History of the Roman Republic&quot;, Livy puts a formulation of the Natural Law into the mouth of Marcus Furius Camillus during the siege of the Falerii &quot;You, villain, have not come with your villainous offer to a nation or a commander like yourself. Between us and the Faliscans there is no fellowship based on a formal compact as between man and man, but the fellowship which is based on natural instincts exists between us, and will continue to do so. There are rights of war as there are rights of peace, and we have learnt to wage our wars with justice no less than with courage. We do not use our weapons against those of an age which is spared even in the capture of cities, but against those who are armed as we are, and who without any injury or provocation from us attacked the Roman camp at Veii. These men you, as far as you could, have vanquished by an unprecedented act of villainy; I shall vanquish them as I vanquished Veii, by Roman arts, by courage and strategy and force of arms.&quot;
Cicero wrote in his &quot;De Legibus&quot; that both justice and law originate from what nature has given to humanity, from what the human mind embraces, from the function of humanity, and from what serves to unite humanity. For Cicero, natural law obliges us to contribute to the general good of the larger society. The purpose of positive laws is to provide for &quot;the safety of citizens, the preservation of states, and the tranquility and happiness of human life&quot;. In this view, &quot;wicked and unjust statutes&quot; are &quot;anything but &#x27;laws, because &quot;in the very definition of the term &#x27;law&#x27; there the idea and principle of choosing what is just and true.&quot; Law, for Cicero, &quot;ought to be a reformer of vice and an incentive to virtue.&quot; Cicero expressed the view that &quot;the virtues which we ought to cultivate, always tend to our own happiness, and that the best means of promoting them consists in living with men in that perfect union and charity which are cemented by mutual benefits.&quot;

In &quot;De Re Publica&quot;, he writes:

Cicero influenced the discussion of natural law for many centuries to come, up through the era of the American Revolution. The jurisprudence of the Roman Empire was rooted in Cicero, who held &quot;an extraordinary grip ... upon the imagination of posterity&quot; as &quot;the medium for the propagation of those ideas which informed the law and institutions of the empire.&quot; Cicero&#x27;s conception of natural law &quot;found its way to later centuries notably through the writings of Isidore of Seville and the Decretum of Gratian.&quot; Thomas Aquinas, in his summary of medieval natural law, quoted Cicero&#x27;s statement that &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;custom&quot; were the sources of a society&#x27;s laws.

The Renaissance Italian historian Leonardo Bruni praised Cicero as the person &quot;who carried philosophy from Greece to Italy, and nourished it with the golden river of his eloquence.&quot; The legal culture of Elizabethan England, exemplified by Sir Edward Coke, was &quot;steeped in Ciceronian rhetoric&quot;. The Scottish moral philosopher Francis Hutcheson, as a student at Glasgow, &quot;was attracted most by Cicero, for whom he always professed the greatest admiration.&quot; More generally in eighteenth-century Great Britain, Cicero&#x27;s name was a household word among educated people. Likewise, &quot;in the admiration of early Americans Cicero took pride of place as orator, political theorist, stylist, and moralist.&quot;

The British polemicist Thomas Gordon &quot;incorporated Cicero into the radical ideological tradition that travelled from the mother country to the colonies in the course of the eighteenth century and decisively shaped early American political culture.&quot; Cicero&#x27;s description of the immutable, eternal, and universal natural law was quoted by Burlamaqui and later by the American revolutionary legal scholar James Wilson. Cicero became John Adams&#x27;s &quot;foremost model of public service, republican virtue, and forensic eloquence&quot;. Adams wrote of Cicero that &quot;as all the ages of the world have not produced a greater statesman and philosopher united in the same character, his authority should have great weight.&quot; Thomas Jefferson &quot;first encountered Cicero as a schoolboy while learning Latin, and continued to read his letters and discourses throughout his life. He admired him as a patriot, valued his opinions as a moral philosopher, and there is little doubt that he looked upon Cicero&#x27;s life, with his love of study and aristocratic country life, as a model for his own.&quot; Jefferson described Cicero as &quot;the father of eloquence and philosophy.&quot;

===Christianity===

Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Romans is generally considered the Scriptural authority for the Christian idea of natural law as something that was endowed in all men, contrasted with an idea of law as something revealed (for example, the law revealed to Moses by God).

The intellectual historian A. J. Carlyle has commented on this passage: &quot;There can be little doubt that St Paul&#x27;s words imply some conception analogous to the &#x27;natural law&#x27; in Cicero, a law written in men&#x27;s hearts, recognized by man&#x27;s reason, a law distinct from the positive law of any State, or from what St Paul recognized as the revealed law of God. It is in this sense that St Paul&#x27;s words are taken by the Fathers of the fourth and fifth centuries like St Hilary of Poitiers, St Ambrose, and St Augustine, and there seems no reason to doubt the correctness of their interpretation.&quot;

Because of its origins in the Old Testament, early Church Fathers, especially those in the West, saw natural law as part of the natural foundation of Christianity. The most notable among these was Augustine of Hippo, who equated natural law with humanity&#x27;s prelapsarian state; as such, a life according to unbroken human nature was no longer possible and persons needed instead to seek healing and salvation through the divine law and grace of Jesus Christ. Augustine was also among the earliest to examine the legitimacy of the laws of man, and attempt to define the boundaries of what laws and rights occur naturally based on wisdom and conscience, instead of being arbitrarily imposed by mortals, and if people are obligated to obey laws that are unjust.

The natural law was inherently teleological as well as deontological. For Christians, natural law is how human beings manifest the divine image in their life. This mimicry of Christ&#x27;s own life is impossible to accomplish except by means of the power of grace. Thus, whereas deontological systems merely require certain duties be performed, Christianity explicitly states that no one can, in fact, perform any duties if grace is lacking. For Christians, natural law flows not from divine commands, but from the fact that humanity is made in God&#x27;s image, humanity is empowered by God&#x27;s grace. Living the natural law is how humanity displays the gifts of life and grace, the gifts of all that is good.

Consequences are in God&#x27;s hands, consequences are generally not within human control, thus in natural law, actions are judged by three things: (1) the person&#x27;s intent, (2) the circumstances of the act and (3) the nature of the act. The apparent good or evil consequence resulting from the moral act is not relevant to the act itself. The specific content of the natural law is therefore determined by how each person&#x27;s acts mirror God&#x27;s internal life of love. Insofar as one lives the natural law, temporal satisfaction may or may not be attained, but salvation will be attained. The state, in being bound by the natural law, is conceived as an institution whose purpose is to assist in bringing its subjects to true happiness. True happiness derives from living in harmony with the mind of God as an image of the living God.

After the Protestant Reformation, some Protestant denominations maintained parts of the Catholic concept of natural law. The English theologian Richard Hooker from the Church of England adapted Thomistic notions of natural law to Anglicanism five principles: to live, to learn, to reproduce, to worship God, and to live in an ordered society.

==== Catholic natural law jurisprudence ====

===== Early natural christian law thinkers=====

In Catholic countries in the tradition of the early Christian law and in the twelfth century, Gratian equated the natural law with divine law. Albertus Magnus would address the subject a century later, and his pupil, Thomas Aquinas, in his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot; I-II qq. 90–106, restored Natural Law to its independent state, asserting natural law as the rational creature&#x27;s participation in the eternal law. Yet, since human reason could not fully comprehend the Eternal law, it needed to be supplemented by revealed Divine law. See also Biblical law in Christianity.

=====Thomas Aquinas=====

Aquinas taught that all human or positive laws were to be judged by their conformity to the natural law. An unjust law is not a law, in the full sense of the word. It retains merely the &#x27;appearance&#x27; of law insofar as it is duly constituted and enforced in the same way a just law is, but is itself a &#x27;perversion of law.&#x27; At this point, the natural law was not only used to pass judgment on the moral worth of various laws, but also to determine what those laws meant in the first place. This principle laid the seed for possible societal tension with reference to tyrants.

The Catholic Church holds the view of natural law introduced by Albertus Magnus and elaborated by Thomas Aquinas, particularly in his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;, and often as filtered through the School of Salamanca. This view is also shared by some Protestants, and was delineated by Anglican writer C. S. Lewis in his works &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; and &quot;The Abolition of Man&quot;.

The Catholic Church understands human beings to consist of body and soul, and that the two are inextricably linked. Humans are capable of discerning the difference between good and evil because they have a conscience. There are many manifestations of the good that we can pursue. Some, like procreation, are common to other animals, while others, like the pursuit of truth, are inclinations peculiar to the capacities of human beings.

To know what is right, one must use one&#x27;s reason and apply it to Thomas Aquinas&#x27; precepts. This reason is believed to be embodied, in its most abstract form, in the concept of a primary precept: &quot;Good is to be sought, evil avoided.&quot; Aquinas explains that:

However, while the primary and immediate precepts cannot be &quot;blotted out&quot;, the secondary precepts can be. Therefore, for a deontological ethical theory they are open to a surprisingly large amount of interpretation and flexibility. Any rule that helps humanity to live up to the primary or subsidiary precepts can be a secondary precept, for example:
* Drunkenness is wrong because it injures one&#x27;s health, and worse, destroys one&#x27;s ability to reason, which is fundamental to humans as rational animals (i.e., does not support self-preservation).
* Theft is wrong because it destroys social relations, and humans are by nature social animals (i.e., does not support the subsidiary precept of living in society).

Natural moral law is concerned with both exterior and interior acts, also known as action and motive. Simply doing the right thing is not enough; to be truly moral one&#x27;s motive must be right as well. For example, helping an old lady across the road (good exterior act) to impress someone (bad interior act) is wrong. However, good intentions don&#x27;t always lead to good actions. The motive must coincide with the cardinal or theological virtues. Cardinal virtues are acquired through reason applied to nature; they are:
# Prudence
# Justice
# Temperance
# Fortitude

The theological virtues are:

# Faith
# Hope
# Charity

According to Aquinas, to lack any of these virtues is to lack the ability to make a moral choice. For example, consider a person who possesses the virtues of justice, prudence, and fortitude, yet lacks temperance. Due to their lack of self-control and desire for pleasure, despite their good intentions, they will find themself swaying from the moral path.

=====School of Salamanca=====
Based on the works of Thomas Aquinas, the members of the School of Salamanca were in the 16th and 17th centuries the first people to develop a modern approach of natural law, which greatly influence Grotius. For Leonardus Lessius, natural law ensues from the rational nature and the natural state of everything: that way it is immutable on the contrary of positive law, which stems from divine or human will.

Jurists and theologians claimed thus the right to observe the conformity of the positive law with natural law. For Domingo de Soto, the theologians task is to assess the moral foundations of civil law. Due to this review right based on natural law, Soto criticised the new Spanish charities&#x27; laws on the pretext that they violated the fondamental rights of the poors, or that Juan de Mariana considered that the consent of population was needed in matter of taxation or money alteration. Criticized by Protestant thinkers like and Samuel von Pufendorf, this view was salvage by the pope Leo XIII in this encyclical , in which he asked the members of clergy to analyse modern legislation in view of higher norms.

Natural law played also a great role in the diffusion of a contractual consensualism. First recognize by glossators and postglossators before the ecclesiastic courts, it was only in the 16th century that civil law allowed the principle of the binding nature of contracts on the basis of pure consent. As Pedro de Oñate said, &quot;Consequently, natural law, canon law and Hispanic law entirely agree and innumerable difficulties, frauds, litigations and disputes have been removed thanks to such great consensus and clarity in the laws. To the contracting parties, liberty has very wisely been restored&quot;.

Besides, natural law also requires the respect of the commutative justice in contractual relations: both parties are bound to respect the notion of just prices on penalty of sin.

=====Modern catechism=====

The Catechism of the Catholic Church describes it in the following way: &quot;The natural law expresses the original moral sense which enables man to discern by reason the good and the evil, the truth and the lie: &#x27;The natural law is written and engraved in the soul of each and every man, because it is human reason ordaining him to do good and forbidding him to sin ... But this command of human reason would not have the force of law if it were not the voice and interpreter of a higher reason to which our spirit and our freedom must be submitted.

The natural law consists, for the Catholic Church, of one supreme and universal principle from which are derived all our natural moral obligations or duties. Thomas Aquinas resumes the various ideas of Catholic moral thinkers about what this principle is: since good is what primarily falls under the apprehension of the practical reason, the supreme principle of moral action must have the good as its central idea, and therefore the supreme principle is that good is to be done and evil avoided.

===Islamic natural law===
Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī, a medieval scholar, scientist, and polymath, understood &quot;natural law&quot; as the survival of the fittest. He argued that the antagonism between human beings can be overcome only through a divine law, which he believed to have been sent through prophets. This is also said to be the general position of the Ashari school, the largest school of Sunni theology, as well as Ibn Hazm. Conceptualized thus, all &quot;laws&quot; are viewed as originating from subjective attitudes actuated by cultural conceptions and individual preferences, and so the notion of &quot;divine revelation&quot; is justified as some kind of &quot;divine intervention&quot; that replaces human positive &quot;laws&quot;, which are criticized as being relative, with a single divine positive &quot;law&quot;. This, however, also entails that anything may be included in &quot;the divine law&quot; as it would in &quot;human laws&quot;, but unlike the latter, &quot;God&#x27;s law&quot; is seen as binding regardless of the nature of the commands by virtue of &quot;God&#x27;s might&quot;: since God is not subject to human laws and conventions, He may command what He wills just as He may do what He wills.

The Maturidi school, the second-largest school of Sunni theology, as well as the Mu&#x27;tazilites, posits the existence of a form of natural, or &quot;objective&quot;, law that humans can comprehend. Abu Mansur al-Maturidi stated that the human mind could know of the existence of God and the major forms of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; without the help of revelation. Al-Maturidi gives the example of stealing, which, he believes, is known to be evil by reason alone due to people&#x27;s working hard for their property. Similarly, killing, fornication, and drunkenness are all &quot;discernible evils&quot; that the human mind could know of according to al-Maturidi. Likewise, Averroes (Ibn Rushd), in his treatise on &quot;Justice and Jihad&quot; and his commentary on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;, writes that the human mind can know of the unlawfulness of killing and stealing and thus of the five maqasid or higher intents of the Islamic sharia, or the protection of religion, life, property, offspring, and reason. His Aristotelian commentaries also influenced the subsequent Averroist movement and the writings of Thomas Aquinas.

Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya also posited that human reason could discern between &quot;great sins&quot; and &quot;good deeds&quot;. Nonetheless, he, like Ibn Taymiyah, emphasized the authority of &quot;divine revelation&quot; and asserted that it must be followed even if it &quot;seems&quot; to contradict human reason, though he stressed that most, if not all, of &quot;God&#x27;s commands&quot; are both sensible (that is, rationalizable) and advantageous to humans in both &quot;this life&quot; and &quot;the hereafter&quot;.

The concept of &quot;Istislah&quot; in Islamic law bears some similarities to the natural law tradition in the West, as exemplified by Thomas Aquinas. However, whereas natural law deems good what is self-evidently good, according as it tends towards the fulfillment of the person, &quot;istislah&quot; typically calls good whatever is related to one of five &quot;basic goods&quot;. Many jurists, theologians, and philosophers attempted to abstract these &quot;basic and fundamental goods&quot; from legal precepts. Al-Ghazali, for instance, defined them as religion, life, reason, lineage, and property, while others add &quot;honor&quot; also.

===Brehon law===

Early Irish law, (The Great Tradition), mentions in a number of places or natural law. This is a concept predating European legal theory, and reflects a type of law that is universal and may be determined by reason and observation of natural action. Neil McLeod identifies concepts that law must accord with: (truth) and (right or entitlement). These two terms occur frequently, though Irish law never strictly defines them. Similarly, the term (law in accordance with proper order) occurs in some places, and even in the titles of certain texts. These were two very real concepts to the jurists and the value of a given judgment with respect to them was apparently ascertainable. McLeod has also suggested that most of the specific laws mentioned have passed the test of time and thus their truth has been confirmed, while other provisions are justified in other ways because they are younger and have not been tested over time.

The laws were written in the oldest dialect of the Irish language, called [Bairla-faina], which even at the time was so difficult that persons about to become brehons had to be specially instructed in it; the length of time from beginning to becoming a learned Brehon was usually 20 years. However, under the law any third person could fulfill the duty if both parties agreed, and both were sane. It has been included in an Ethno-Celtic breakaway subculture, as it has religious undertones and freedom of religious expression allows it to once again be used as a valid system in Western Europe.

===English jurisprudence===
Heinrich A. Rommen remarked upon &quot;the tenacity with which the spirit of the English common law retained the conceptions of natural law and equity which it had assimilated during the Catholic Middle Ages, thanks especially to the influence of Henry de Bracton (d. 1268) and Sir John Fortescue (d. cir. 1476).&quot; Bracton&#x27;s translator notes that Bracton &quot;was a trained jurist with the principles and distinctions of Roman jurisprudence firmly in mind&quot;; but Bracton adapted such principles to English purposes rather than copying slavishly. In particular, Bracton turned the imperial Roman maxim that &quot;the will of the prince is law&quot; on its head, insisting that the king is &quot;under&quot; the law.

The legal historian Charles F. Mullett has noted Bracton&#x27;s &quot;ethical definition of law, his recognition of justice, and finally his devotion to natural rights&quot;. Bracton considered justice to be the &quot;fountain-head&quot; from which &quot;all rights arise&quot;. For his definition of justice, Bracton quoted the twelfth-century Italian jurist Azo: &quot;Justice is the constant and unfailing will to give to each his right.&quot; Bracton&#x27;s work was the second legal treatise studied by the American historical figure Thomas Jefferson as a young apprentice lawyer.

Fortescue stressed &quot;the supreme importance of the law of God and of nature&quot; in works that &quot;profoundly influenced the course of legal development in the following centuries.&quot; The legal scholar Ellis Sandoz has noted that &quot;the historically ancient and the ontologically higher law—eternal, divine, natural—are woven together to compose a single harmonious texture in Fortescue&#x27;s account of English law.&quot; As the legal historian Norman Doe explains: &quot;Fortescue follows the general pattern set by Aquinas. The objective of every legislator is to dispose people to virtue. It is by means of law that this is accomplished. Fortescue&#x27;s definition of law (also found in Accursius and Bracton), after all, was &#x27;a sacred sanction commanding what is virtuous [] and forbidding the contrary&#x27;.&quot; Fortescue cited the great Italian Leonardo Bruni for his statement that &quot;virtue alone produces happiness&quot;.

Christopher St. Germain&#x27;s &quot;The Doctor and Student&quot; was a classic of English jurisprudence. Norman Doe notes that St. Germain&#x27;s view &quot;is essentially Thomist&quot;, quoting Thomas Aquinas&#x27;s definition of law as &quot;an ordinance of reason made for the common good by him who has charge of the community, and promulgated&quot;.

Sir Edward Coke was the preeminent jurist of his time. Coke&#x27;s preeminence extended across the ocean: &quot;For the American revolutionary leaders, &#x27;law&#x27; meant Sir Edward Coke&#x27;s custom and right reason.&quot; Coke defined law as &quot;perfect reason, which commands those things that are proper and necessary and which prohibits contrary things&quot;. For Coke, human nature determined the purpose of law; and law was superior to any one person&#x27;s reason or will. Coke&#x27;s discussion of natural law appears in his report of &quot;Calvin&#x27;s Case&quot; (1608): &quot;The law of nature is that which God at the time of creation of the nature of man infused into his heart, for his preservation and direction.&quot; In this case the judges found that &quot;the ligeance or faith of the subject is due unto the King by the law of nature: secondly, that the law of nature is part of the law of England: thirdly, that the law of nature was before any judicial or municipal law: fourthly, that the law of nature is immutable.&quot; To support these findings, the assembled judges (as reported by Coke, who was one of them) cited as authorities Aristotle, Cicero, and the Apostle Paul; as well as Bracton, Fortescue, and St. Germain.

After Coke, the most famous common law jurist of the seventeenth century is Sir Matthew Hale. Hale wrote a treatise on natural law that circulated among English lawyers in the eighteenth century and survives in three manuscript copies. This natural-law treatise has been published as &quot;Of the Law of Nature&quot; (2015). Hale&#x27;s definition of the natural law reads: &quot;It is the Law of Almighty God given by him to Man with his Nature discovering the morall good and moral evill of Moral Actions, commanding the former, and forbidding the latter by the secret voice or dictate of his implanted nature, his reason, and his concience.&quot;

He viewed natural law as antecedent, preparatory, and subsequent to civil government, and stated that human law &quot;cannot forbid what the Law of Nature injoins, nor Command what the Law of Nature prohibits.&quot; He cited as authorities Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Seneca, Epictetus, and the Apostle Paul. He was critical of Hobbes&#x27;s reduction of natural law to self-preservation and Hobbes&#x27;s account of the state of nature, but drew positively on Hugo Grotius&#x27;s &quot;De jure belli ac pacis&quot;, Francisco Suárez&#x27;s &quot;Tractatus de legibus ac deo legislatore&quot;, and John Selden&#x27;s &quot;De jure naturali et gentium juxta disciplinam Ebraeorum&quot;.

As early as the thirteenth century, it was held that &quot;the law of nature ... is the ground of all law.&quot; and by the Chancellor and Judges that &quot;it is required by the law of nature that every person, before he can be punish&#x27;d, ought to be present; and if absent by contumacy, he ought to be summoned and make default.&quot; Further, in 1824, we find it held that &quot;proceedings in our Courts are founded upon the law of England, and that law is again founded upon the law of nature and the revealed law of God. If the right sought to be enforced is inconsistent with either of these, the English municipal courts cannot recognize it.&quot;

====Hobbes====

By the 17th century, the medieval teleological view came under intense criticism from some quarters. Thomas Hobbes instead founded a contractarian theory of legal positivism on what all men could agree upon: what they sought (happiness) was subject to contention, but a broad consensus could form around what they feared, such as violent death at the hands of another. The natural law was how a rational human being, seeking to survive and prosper, would act. Natural law, therefore, was discovered by considering humankind&#x27;s natural rights, whereas previously it could be said that natural rights were discovered by considering the natural law.

In Hobbes&#x27; opinion, the only way natural law could prevail was for men to submit to the commands of the sovereign. Because the ultimate source of law now comes from the sovereign, and the sovereign&#x27;s decisions need not be grounded in morality, legal positivism is born. Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s modifications on legal positivism further developed the theory.

As used by Thomas Hobbes in his treatises &quot;Leviathan&quot; and &quot;De Cive&quot;, natural law is &quot;a precept, or general rule, found out by reason, by which a man is forbidden to do, that, which is destructive of his life, or taketh away the means of preserving the same; and to omit, that, by which he thinketh it may best be preserved.&quot;

According to Hobbes, there are nineteen Laws. The first two are expounded in chapter XIV of &quot;Leviathan&quot; (&quot;of the first and second natural laws; and of contracts&quot;); the others in chapter XV (&quot;of other laws of nature&quot;).

* The first law of nature is &quot;that every man ought to endeavour peace, as far as he has hope of obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek and use all helps, and advantages of war&quot;.
* The second law of nature is &quot;that a man be willing, when others are so too, as far-forth, as for peace, and defence of himself he shall think it necessary, to lay down this right to all things; and be contented with so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself.&quot;
* The third law is &quot;that men perform their covenants made ... In this law of nature consisteth the fountain and original of &#x27;justice&#x27; ... when a covenant is made, then to break it is &#x27;unjust&#x27;: and the definition of &#x27;injustice&#x27;, is no other than &#x27;the not performance of covenant&#x27;. And whatsoever is not unjust, is &#x27;just&#x27;.&quot;
* The fourth law is &quot;that a man which receiveth benefit from another of mere grace, endeavour that he which giveth it, have no reasonable cause to repent him of his good will. ... The breach of this law is called &#x27;ingratitude.
* The fifth law is complaisance: &quot;that every man strive to accommodate himself to the rest. ... The observers of this law, may be called &#x27;sociable&#x27; ...; the contrary, &#x27;stubborn&#x27;, &#x27;insociable&#x27;, &#x27;forward&#x27;, &#x27;intractable&#x27;.&quot;
* The sixth law is &quot;that upon caution of the future time, a man ought to pardon the offences past of them that repenting, desire it.&quot;
* The seventh law is &quot;that in revenges, ... men look not at the greatness of the evil past, but the greatness of the good to follow.&quot;
* The eighth law is &quot;that no man by deed, word, countenance, or gesture, declare hatred or contempt of another.  The breach of which law is commonly called contumely.&quot;
* The ninth law is &quot;that every man acknowledge another for his equal by nature. ... The breach of this precept is &#x27;pride&#x27;.&quot;
* The tenth law is &quot;that at the entrance into the conditions of peace, no man require to reserve to himself any right which he is not content should be reserved to every one of the rest. ... The observers of this law are those we call &#x27;modest&#x27;, and the breakers &#x27;arrogant&#x27; men.&quot;
* The eleventh law is that &quot;if a man be trusted to judge between man and man, ... that he deal equally between them.&quot;
* The twelfth law is &quot;that such things as cannot be divided, be enjoyed in common, if it can be; and if the quantity of the thing permit, without stint; otherwise proportionably to the number of them that have right.&quot;
* The thirteenth law is &quot;the entire right, or else ... the first possession&quot; (in the case of alternating use), of a thing that &quot;can neither be divided nor enjoyed in common&quot; should be determined by lottery.
* The fourteenth law is that &quot;those things which cannot be enjoyed in common, nor divided, ought to be adjudged to the first possessor; and in some cases to the first born, as acquired by lot.&quot;
* The fifteenth law is that &quot;all men that mediate peace, be allowed safe conduct.&quot;
* The sixteenth law is &quot;that they that are at controversie, submit their Right to the judgement of an Arbitrator.&quot;
* The seventeenth law is &quot;that no man is a fit Arbitrator in his own cause.&quot;
* The eighteenth law is that no man should serve as a judge in a case if &quot;greater profit, or honour, or pleasure apparently ariseth [for him] out of the victory of one party, than of the other.&quot;
* The nineteenth law is that in a disagreement of fact, the judge should not give more weight to the testimony of one party than another, and absent other evidence, should give credit to the testimony of other witnesses.

Hobbes&#x27;s philosophy includes a frontal assault on the founding principles of the earlier natural legal tradition, disregarding the traditional association of virtue with happiness, and likewise re-defining &quot;law&quot; to remove any notion of the promotion of the common good. Hobbes has no use for Aristotle&#x27;s association of nature with human perfection, inverting Aristotle&#x27;s use of the word &quot;nature&quot;. Hobbes posits a primitive, unconnected state of nature in which men, having a &quot;natural proclivity ... to hurt each other&quot; also have &quot;a Right to every thing, even to one anothers body&quot;; and &quot;nothing can be Unjust&quot; in this &quot;warre of every man against every man&quot; in which human life is &quot;solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short.&quot;

Rejecting Cicero&#x27;s view that people join in society primarily through &quot;a certain social spirit which nature has implanted in man&quot;, Hobbes declares that men join in society simply for the purpose of &quot;getting themselves out from that miserable condition of Warre, which is necessarily consequent ... to the naturall Passions of men, when there is no visible Power to keep them in awe.&quot; As part of his campaign against the classical idea of natural human sociability, Hobbes inverts that fundamental natural legal maxim, the Golden Rule. Hobbes&#x27;s version is &quot;Do not that to another, which thou wouldst not have done to thy selfe.&quot;

====Cumberland&#x27;s rebuttal of Hobbes====
The English cleric Richard Cumberland wrote a lengthy and influential attack on Hobbes&#x27;s depiction of individual self-interest as the essential feature of human motivation. Historian Knud Haakonssen has noted that in the eighteenth century, Cumberland was commonly placed alongside Alberico Gentili, Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf &quot;in the triumvirate of seventeenth-century founders of the &#x27;modern&#x27; school of natural law&quot;. The eighteenth-century philosophers Shaftesbury and Hutcheson &quot;were obviously inspired in part by Cumberland&quot;. Historian Jon Parkin likewise describes Cumberland&#x27;s work as &quot;one of the most important works of ethical and political theory of the seventeenth century&quot;.

Parkin observes that much of Cumberland&#x27;s material &quot;is derived from Roman Stoicism, particularly from the work of Cicero, as &quot;Cumberland deliberately cast his engagement with Hobbes in the mould of Cicero&#x27;s debate between the Stoics, who believed that nature could provide an objective morality, and Epicureans, who argued that morality was human, conventional and self-interested.&quot; In doing so, Cumberland de-emphasized the overlay of Christian dogma (in particular, the doctrine of &quot;original sin&quot; and the corresponding presumption that humans are incapable of &quot;perfecting&quot; themselves without divine intervention) that had accreted to natural law in the Middle Ages.

By way of contrast to Hobbes&#x27;s multiplicity of laws, Cumberland states in the very first sentence of his &quot;Treatise of the Laws of Nature&quot; that &quot;all the Laws of Nature are reduc&#x27;d to that one, of Benevolence toward all Rationals.&quot; He later clarifies: &quot;By the name &quot;Rationals&quot; I beg leave to understand, as well &quot;God&quot; as &quot;Man&quot;; and I do it upon the Authority of Cicero.&quot; Cumberland argues that the mature development (&quot;perfection&quot;) of human nature involves the individual human willing and acting for the common good.

For Cumberland, human interdependence precludes Hobbes&#x27;s natural right of each individual to wage war against all the rest for personal survival. However, Haakonssen warns against reading Cumberland as a proponent of &quot;enlightened self-interest&quot;. Rather, the &quot;proper moral love of humanity&quot; is &quot;a disinterested love of God through love of humanity in ourselves as well as others&quot;. Cumberland concludes that actions &quot;principally conducive to our Happiness&quot; are those that promote &quot;the Honour and Glory of God&quot; and also &quot;Charity and Justice towards men&quot;.

Cumberland emphasizes that desiring the well-being of our fellow humans is essential to the &quot;pursuit of our own Happiness&quot;. He cites &quot;reason&quot; as the authority for his conclusion that happiness consists in &quot;the most extensive Benevolence&quot;, but he also mentions as &quot;Essential Ingredients of Happiness&quot; the &quot;Benevolent Affections&quot;, meaning &quot;Love and Benevolence towards others&quot;, as well as &quot;that Joy, which arises from their Happiness&quot;.

====American jurisprudence====

The U.S. Declaration of Independence states that it has become necessary for the people of the United States to assume &quot;the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature&#x27;s God entitle them&quot;. Some early American lawyers and judges perceived natural law as too tenuous, amorphous, and evanescent a legal basis for grounding concrete rights and governmental limitations. Natural law did, however, serve as authority for legal claims and rights in some judicial decisions, legislative acts, and legal pronouncements. Robert Lowry Clinton argues that the U.S. Constitution rests on a common law foundation and the common law, in turn, rests on a classical natural law foundation.

===European liberal natural law===

Liberal natural law grew out of the medieval Christian natural law theories and out of Hobbes&#x27; revision of natural law, sometimes in an uneasy balance of the two.

Sir Alberico Gentili and Hugo Grotius based their philosophies of international law on natural law. In particular, Grotius&#x27;s writings on freedom of the seas and just war theory directly appealed to natural law. About natural law itself, he wrote that &quot;even the will of an omnipotent being cannot change or abrogate&quot; natural law, which &quot;would maintain its objective validity even if we should assume the impossible, that there is no God or that he does not care for human affairs.&quot; (&quot;De iure belli ac pacis&quot;, Prolegomeni XI). This is the famous argument &quot;etiamsi daremus&quot; (&quot;non esse Deum&quot;), that made natural law no longer dependent on theology. However, German church-historians Ernst Wolf and M. Elze disagreed and wrote that Grotius&#x27; concept of natural law did have a theological basis. In Grotius&#x27; view, the Old Testament contained moral precepts (e.g. the Decalogue) which Christ confirmed and therefore were still valid. Moreover, they were useful in explaining the content of natural law. Both biblical revelation and natural law originated in God and could therefore not contradict each other.

In a similar way, Samuel Pufendorf gave natural law a theological foundation and applied it to his concepts of government and international law.

John Locke incorporated natural law into many of his theories and philosophy, especially in &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot;. There is considerable debate about whether his conception of natural law was more akin to that of Aquinas (filtered through Richard Hooker) or Hobbes&#x27; radical reinterpretation, though the effect of Locke&#x27;s understanding is usually phrased in terms of a revision of Hobbes upon Hobbesian contractarian grounds. Locke turned Hobbes&#x27; prescription around, saying that if the ruler went against natural law and failed to protect &quot;life, liberty, and property,&quot; people could justifiably overthrow the existing state and create a new one.

While Locke spoke in the language of natural law, the content of this law was by and large protective of natural rights, and it was this language that later liberal thinkers preferred. Political philosopher Jeremy Waldron has pointed out that Locke&#x27;s political thought was based on &quot;a particular set of Protestant Christian assumptions.&quot; To Locke, the content of natural law was identical with biblical ethics as laid down especially in the Decalogue, Christ&#x27;s teaching and exemplary life, and Paul&#x27;s admonitions. Locke derived the concept of basic human equality, including the equality of the sexes (&quot;Adam and Eve&quot;), from Genesis 1, 26–28, the starting-point of the theological doctrine of Imago Dei. One of the consequences is that as all humans are created equally free, governments need the consent of the governed.

Thomas Jefferson, arguably echoing Locke, appealed to unalienable rights in the &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot;, &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are &quot;created&quot; equal, that they are endowed by their &quot;Creator&quot; with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&quot; The Lockean idea that governments need the consent of the governed was also fundamental to the Declaration of Independence, as the American Revolutionaries used it as justification for their separation from the British crown.

The Belgian philosopher of law Frank van Dun is one among those who are elaborating a secular conception of natural law in the liberal tradition. Anarcho-capitalist theorist Murray Rothbard argues that &quot;the very existence of a natural law discoverable by reason is a potentially powerful threat to the status quo and a standing reproach to the reign of blindly traditional custom or the arbitrary will of the State apparatus.&quot; Austrian school economist Ludwig von Mises states that he relaid the general sociological and economic foundations of the liberal doctrine upon utilitarianism, rather than natural law, but R. A. Gonce argues that &quot;the reality of the argument constituting his system overwhelms his denial.&quot; Murray Rothbard, however, says that Gonce makes a lot of errors and distortions in the analysis of Mises&#x27;s works, including making confusions about the term which Mises uses to refer to scientific laws, &quot;laws of nature&quot;, saying it characterizes Mises as a natural law philosopher. David Gordon notes, &quot;When most people speak of natural law, what they have in mind is the contention that morality can be derived from human nature. If human beings are rational animals of such-and-such a sort, then the moral virtues are...(filling in the blanks is the difficult part).&quot;

Nobel Prize winning Austrian economist and social theorist F. A. Hayek said that, originally, &quot;the term &#x27;natural&#x27; was used to describe an orderliness or regularity that was not the product of deliberate human will. Together with &#x27;organism&#x27; it was one of the two terms generally understood to refer to the spontaneously grown in contrast to the invented or designed. Its use in this sense had been inherited from the stoic philosophy, had been revived in the twelfth century, and it was finally under its flag that the late Spanish Schoolmen developed the foundations of the genesis and functioning of spontaneously formed social institutions.&quot;

The idea that &#x27;natural&#x27; was &quot;the product of designing reason&quot; is a product of a seventeenth century rationalist reinterpretation of the law of nature. Luis Molina, for example, when referred to the &#x27;natural&#x27; price, explained that it is &quot;so called because &#x27;it results from the thing itself without regard to laws and decrees, but is dependent on many circumstances which alter it, such as the sentiments of men, their estimation of different uses, often even in consequence of whims and pleasures.&quot; And even John Locke, when talking about the foundations of natural law and explaining what he thought when citing &quot;reason&quot;, said: &quot;By reason, however, I do not think is meant here that faculty of the understanding which forms traint of thought and deduces proofs, but certain definite principles of action from which spring all virtues and whatever is necessary for the proper moulding of morals.&quot;

This anti-rationalist approach to human affairs, for Hayek, was the same which guided Scottish enlightenment thinkers, such as Adam Smith, David Hume and Adam Ferguson, to make their case for liberty. For them, no one can have the knowledge necessary to plan society, and this &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;spontaneous&quot; order of society shows how it can efficiently &quot;plan&quot; bottom-up. Also, the idea that law is just a product of deliberate design, denied by natural law and linked to legal positivism, can easily generate totalitarianism: &quot;If law is wholly the product of deliberate design, whatever the designer decrees to be law is just by definition and unjust law becomes a contradiction in terms. The will of the duly authorized legislator is then wholly unfettered and guided solely by his concrete interests.&quot; This idea is wrong because law cannot be just a product of &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;no system of articulated law can be applied except within a framework of generally recognized but often unarticulated rules of justice.&quot;

However, a secular critique of the natural law doctrine was stated by Pierre Charron in his &quot;De la sagesse&quot; (1601): &quot;The sign of a natural law must be the universal respect in which it is held, for if there was anything that nature had truly commanded us to do, we would undoubtedly obey it universally: not only would every nation respect it, but every individual. Instead there is nothing in the world that is not subject to contradiction and dispute, nothing that is not rejected, not just by one nation, but by many; equally, there is nothing that is strange and (in the opinion of many) unnatural that is not approved in many countries, and authorized by their customs.&quot;

==Contemporary jurisprudence==
One modern articulation of the concept of natural laws was given by Belina and Dzudzek:

In jurisprudence, &quot;natural law&quot; can refer to the several doctrines:
* That just laws are immanent in nature; that is, they can be &quot;discovered&quot; or &quot;found&quot; but not &quot;created&quot; by such things as a bill of rights;
* That they can emerge by the natural process of resolving conflicts, as embodied by the evolutionary process of the common law; or
* That the meaning of law is such that its content cannot be determined except by reference to moral principles. 
These meanings can either oppose or complement each other, although they share the common trait that they rely on inherence as opposed to design in finding just laws.

Whereas legal positivism would say that a law can be unjust without it being any less a law, a natural law jurisprudence would say that there is something legally deficient about an unjust norm.

Besides utilitarianism and Kantianism, natural law jurisprudence has in common with virtue ethics that it is a live option for a first principles ethics theory in analytic philosophy.

The concept of natural law was very important in the development of the English common law. In the struggles between Parliament and the monarch, Parliament often made reference to the Fundamental Laws of England, which were at times said to embody natural law principles since time immemorial and set limits on the power of the monarchy. According to William Blackstone, however, natural law might be useful in determining the content of the common law and in deciding cases of equity, but was not itself identical with the laws of England. Nonetheless, the implication of natural law in the common law tradition has meant that the great opponents of natural law and advocates of legal positivism, like Jeremy Bentham, have also been staunch critics of the common law.

Today, the most cited authors in literature related to natural law are, in their order: Aquinas, John Finnis, John Locke, Lon Fuller, Ronald Dworkin, and James Wilson, who participated in drafting the U.S. Declaration of Independence. It shows how Aquinas has still a significant influence on the topic. The second Australian professor at Oxford University, John Finnis, is the most prominent contemporary natural law jurist alive. Other authors, like the Americans Germain Grisez, Robert P. George, and Canadian Joseph Boyle and Brazilian Emídio Brasileiro are also constructing a new version of natural law. They created a school called &quot;New Natural Law&quot;, originated by Grisez. It focuses on &quot;basic human goods&quot;, such as human life, knowledge, and aesthetic experience, which are self-evidently and intrinsically worthwhile, and states that these goods reveal themselves as being incommensurable with one another.

The 19th-century anarchist and legal theorist Lysander Spooner was also a figure in the expression of modern natural law.

The tensions between natural law and positive law have played, and continue to play, a key role in the development of international law.

U.S. Supreme Court justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch are proponents of natural law.

== Methodology ==

The authors and supporters of natural law use various methods to develop and articulate their ideas. Here are some of the commonly employed methods:

# Rational inquiry and human reason: Natural law theorists often engage in rational inquiry to explore the nature of human beings, their moral obligations, and the principles that govern human conduct. They rely on logical reasoning and philosophical analysis to derive principles of natural law. Most Modern scholars dedicated to natural law will follow this rationalistic approach.
# Observation of nature: Natural law authors sometimes draw on observations of the natural world and human behavior to derive moral principles. According to Aristotle and Aquinas, it is possible to examine the humans powers and inclinations, to detect what kind of goods are achievable and deserve to be reached.
# Historical and comparative analysis: Some authors of natural law examine historical legal systems and comparative law to identify common moral principles embedded within them. They may explore ancient legal codes, religious texts, and philosophical treatises to uncover ethical norms that have stood the test of time. To some extent, Montesquieu and Max Gluckman did a similar analysis, although the latter under another school of thought.
# Axiology and Theology: Natural law theorists often incorporate resort to several ends and values to detect principles and rules of natural law. For instance, John Finnis develops natural law based on seven basic good (life, knowledge, play, aesthetic experience, sociability, practical reasonableness, religion) that he believes are self-evident.
# Dialogue, Debate, Experience, Interpretation and other schools: Several natural law methods have been developed in different schools. Some authors engage in scholarly dialogue and debate with other philosophers and ethicists. They present their arguments, respond to objections, and refine their theories through critical discussion and exchange of ideas. Michael Moore has presented his realistic interpretational approach to the law. Quite different will be the view of Lon Fuller. It is important to note that the methods employed by authors of natural law may vary depending on their specific philosophical perspectives and the historical context in which they work. Different natural law theorists may emphasize different approaches in their efforts to articulate the foundations and implications of natural law.

Nevertheless, Riofrio has detected in a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the most cited papers of natural law, that authors dedicated to natural law usually take into account some elements to deduce others. For instance, Finnis deduces legal principles and natural rights from the seven basic goods; Aquinas deduces the human goods from the human powers, and so on. The elements of the so-called &quot;Natural Law Formula&quot;, are the following ones: being (of people and things) – potencies of human beings and things – aims and inclinations of those potencies; means – human values or goods – ethical and legal principles – rules – natural and positive rights – cases and circumstances.

<text>Nestorianism is a term used in Christian theology and Church history to refer to several mutually related but doctrinarily distinct sets of teachings. The first meaning of the term is related to the original teachings of Christian theologian Nestorius (), who promoted specific doctrines in the fields of Christology and Mariology. The second meaning of the term is much wider, and relates to a set of later theological teachings, that were traditionally labeled as Nestorian, but differ from the teachings of Nestorius in origin, scope and terminology. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines Nestorianism as:&quot;The doctrine of Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople (appointed in 428), by which Christ is asserted to have had distinct human and divine persons.&quot;Original Nestorianism is attested primarily by works of Nestorius, and also by other theological and historical sources that are related to his teachings in the fields of Mariology and Christology. His theology was influenced by teachings of Theodore of Mopsuestia (), the most prominent theologian of the Antiochian School. Nestorian Mariology prefers the title Christotokos, which encompasses the term &quot;Theotokos&quot; (&#x27;God-bearer&#x27;) for Mary, thus emphasizing distinction between divine and human aspects of the Incarnation. Nestorian Christology promotes the concept of a prosopic union of two concrete realities (divine and human) in Jesus Christ, thus trying to avoid and replace the concept of a hypostatic union of two natures. The distinction is between &#x27;two hypostases in one person&#x27; and &#x27;two natures in one person&#x27;. Hypostasis is not seen as subject, but rather a nature existing in reality. This Christological position is viewed by the West as &quot;radical dyophysitism&quot;, and differs from eastern orthodox dyophysitism, that was reaffirmed at the Council of Chalcedon (451). Such teachings brought Nestorius into conflict with other prominent church leaders, most notably Cyril of Alexandria, who issued 12 anathemas against him (430). Nestorius and his teachings were eventually condemned as heretical at the Council of Ephesus in 431, and again at the Council of Chalcedon in 451. His teachings were considered as heretical not only in Chalcedonian Christianity, but even more in Oriental Orthodoxy. The already long extant Assyrian Church of the East, would affirm the orthodoxy of Nestorius, lining up the tradition of the fathers which preceded him.

After the condemnation, some supporters of Nestorius, who were followers of the Antiochian School and the School of Edessa, relocated to the Sasanian Empire, where they were affiliated with the local Assyrian community of the satrapy of Asuristan (Assyria), many who were followers of the Assyrian Church, known as the Church of the East, while others were Syriac Orthodox. During the period from 484 to 612, gradual development led to the creation of specific doctrinal views within the Church of the East. Evolution of those views was finalized by prominent East Syriac theologian Babai the Great () who was using the specific Syriac term () as a designation for dual (divine and human) substances within one prosopon (person or hypostasis) of Christ. Such views were officially adopted by the Church of the East at a council held in 612. 

Opponents of such views in the West inaccurately labeled them as &quot;Nestorian&quot;, leading to the practice of mislabeling the Church of the East as Nestorian, and indeed the Assyrian people themselves as &quot;Nestorians&quot; . For a long time this seemed an appropriate usage, since Nestorius is officially venerated as a saint in the Assyrian Church of the East. But in modern religious studies it has been criticized as wholly improper and misleading. As a consequence, both in scholarly literature and in the field of inter-denominational relations, the term &quot;Nestorian&quot; increasingly focuses on its primary meaning, the original teachings of Nestorius, rather than referring to the far older-originating Assyrian Church of the East or its offshoot, the Chaldean Catholic Church.

==History==
Nestorianism was condemned as heresy at the Council of Ephesus (431). The Armenian Church rejected the Council of Chalcedon (451) because they believed Chalcedonian Definition was too similar to Nestorianism. The Persian Nestorian Church, on the other hand, supported the spread of Nestorianism in Persarmenia. The Armenian Church and other eastern churches saw the rise of Nestorianism as a threat to the independence of their Church. Peter the Iberian, a Georgian prince, also strongly opposed the Chalcedonian Creed. Thus, in 491, Catholicos Babken I of Armenia, along with the Albanian and Iberian bishops met in Vagharshapat and issued a condemnation of the Chalcedonian Definition.

Nestorians held that the Council of Chalcedon proved the orthodoxy of their faith and had started persecuting non-Chalcedonian or Miaphysite Syriac Christians during the reign of Peroz I. In response to pleas for assistance from the Syriac Church, Armenian prelates issued a letter addressed to Persian Christians reaffirming their condemnation of the Nestorianism as heresy.

Following the exodus to Persia, scholars expanded on the teachings of Nestorius and his mentors, particularly after the relocation of the School of Edessa to the (then) Persian city of Nisibis (modern-day Nusaybin in Turkey) in 489, where it became known as the School of Nisibis. Nestorian monasteries propagating the teachings of the Nisibis school flourished in 6th century Persarmenia.

Despite this initial Eastern expansion, the Nestorians&#x27; missionary success was eventually deterred. David J. Bosch observes, &quot;By the end of the fourteenth century, however, the Nestorian and other churches—which at one time had dotted the landscape of all of Central and even parts of East Asia—were all but wiped out. Isolated pockets of Christianity survived only in India. The religious victors on the vast Central Asian mission field of the Nestorians were Islam and Buddhism&quot;.

==Doctrine==

Nestorianism is a radical form of dyophysitism, differing from orthodox dyophysitism on several points, mainly by opposition to the concept of hypostatic union. It can be seen as the antithesis to Eutychian Monophysitism, which emerged in reaction to Nestorianism. Where Nestorianism holds that Christ had two loosely united natures, divine and human, Monophysitism holds that he had but a single nature, his human nature being absorbed into his divinity. A brief definition of Nestorian Christology can be given as: &quot;Jesus Christ, who is not identical with the Son but personally united with the Son, who lives in him, is one hypostasis and one nature: human.&quot; This contrasts with Nestorius&#x27; own teaching that the Word, which is eternal, and the Flesh, which is not, came together in a hypostatic union, &#x27;Jesus Christ&#x27;, Jesus thus being both fully man and God, of two &quot;ousia&quot; () (essences) but of one (person). Both Nestorianism and Monophysitism were condemned as heretical at the Council of Chalcedon.

Nestorius developed his Christological views as an attempt to understand and explain rationally the incarnation of the divine Logos, the Second Person of the Holy Trinity as the man Jesus. He had studied at the School of Antioch where his mentor had been Theodore of Mopsuestia; Theodore and other Antioch theologians had long taught a literalist interpretation of the Bible and stressed the distinctiveness of the human and divine natures of Jesus. Nestorius took his Antiochene leanings with him when he was appointed Patriarch of Constantinople by Byzantine emperor Theodosius II in 428.

Nestorius&#x27;s teachings became the root of controversy when he publicly challenged the long-used title &quot;Theotokos&quot; (&#x27;God-Bearer&#x27;) for Mary. He suggested that the title denied Christ&#x27;s full humanity, arguing instead that Jesus had two persons (dyoprosopism), the divine Logos and the human Jesus. As a result of this prosopic duality, he proposed (&#x27;Christ-Bearer&#x27;) as a more suitable title for Mary.

He also advanced the image of Jesus as a warrior-king and rescuer of Israel over the traditional image of the .

Nestorius&#x27; opponents found his teaching too close to the heresy of adoptionism – the idea that Christ had been born a man who had later been &quot;adopted&quot; as God&#x27;s son. Nestorius was especially criticized by Cyril, Patriarch of Alexandria, who argued that Nestorius&#x27;s teachings undermined the unity of Christ&#x27;s divine and human natures at the Incarnation. Some of Nestorius&#x27;s opponents argued that he put too much emphasis on the human nature of Christ, and others debated that the difference that Nestorius implied between the human nature and the divine nature created a fracture in the singularity of Christ, thus creating two Christ figures. Nestorius himself always insisted that his views were orthodox, though they were deemed heretical at the Council of Ephesus in 431, leading to the Nestorian Schism, when churches supportive of Nestorius and the rest of the Christian Church separated. However, this formulation was never adopted by all churches termed &#x27;Nestorian&#x27;. Indeed, the modern Assyrian Church of the East, which reveres Nestorius, does not fully subscribe to Nestorian doctrine, though it does not employ the title &quot;Theotokos&quot;.

==Nestorian Schism==
Nestorianism became a distinct sect following the Nestorian Schism, beginning in the 430s. Nestorius had come under fire from Western theologians, most notably Cyril of Alexandria. Cyril had both theological and political reasons for attacking Nestorius; on top of feeling that Nestorianism was an error against true belief, he also wanted to denigrate the head of a competing patriarchate. Cyril and Nestorius asked Pope Celestine I to weigh in on the matter. Celestine found that the title &quot;Theotokos&quot; was orthodox, and authorized Cyril to ask Nestorius to recant. Cyril, however, used the opportunity to further attack Nestorius, who pleaded with Emperor Theodosius II to call a council so that all grievances could be aired.

In 431 Theodosius called the Council of Ephesus. However, the council ultimately sided with Cyril, who held that the Christ contained two natures in one divine person (&quot;hypostasis&quot;, unity of subsistence), and that the Virgin Mary, conceiving and bearing this divine person, is truly called the Mother of God (&quot;Theotokos&quot;). The council accused Nestorius of heresy, and deposed him as patriarch. Upon returning to his monastery in 436, he was banished to Upper Egypt. Nestorianism was officially anathematized, a ruling reiterated at the Council of Chalcedon in 451. However, a number of churches, particularly those associated with the School of Edessa, supported Nestorius – though not necessarily his doctrine – and broke with the churches of the West. Many of Nestorius&#x27; supporters relocated to the Sasanian Empire of Iran, home to a vibrant but persecuted Christian minority. In Upper Egypt, Nestorius wrote his &quot;Book of Heraclides&quot;, responding to the two councils at Ephesus (431, 449).

==Church of the East==

The western provinces of the Persian Empire had been home to Christian communities, headed by metropolitans, and later patriarchs of Seleucia-Ctesiphon. The Christian minority in Persia was frequently persecuted by the Zoroastrian majority, which accused local Christians of political leanings towards the Roman Empire. In 424, the Church in Persia declared itself independent, in order to ward off allegations of any foreign allegiance. By the end of the 5th century, the Persian Church increasingly aligned itself with the teachings of Theodore of Mopsuestia and his followers, many of whom became dissidents after the Councils of Ephesus (431) and Chalcedon (451). The Persian Church became increasingly opposed to doctrines promoted by those councils, thus furthering the divide between Chalcedonian and Persian currents.

In 486, the Metropolitan Barsauma of Nisibis publicly accepted Nestorius&#x27; mentor Theodore of Mopsuestia as a spiritual authority. In 489, when the School of Edessa in Mesopotamia was closed by Byzantine Emperor Zeno for its pro-Nestorian teachings, the school relocated to its original home of Nisibis, becoming again the School of Nisibis, leading to the migration of a wave of Christian dissidents into Persia. The Persian patriarch Babai (497–502) reiterated and expanded upon the church&#x27;s esteem for Theodore of Mopsuestia.

Now firmly established in Persia, with centers in Nisibis, Ctesiphon, and Gundeshapur, and several &quot;metropoleis&quot;, the Persian Church began to branch out beyond the Sasanian Empire. However, through the sixth century, the church was frequently beset with internal strife and persecution by Zoroastrians. The infighting led to a schism, which lasted from 521 until around 539 when the issues were resolved. However, immediately afterward Roman-Persian conflict led to the persecution of the church by the Sassanid emperor Khosrow I; this ended in 545. The church survived these trials under the guidance of Patriarch Aba I, who had converted to Christianity from Zoroastrianism.

The church emerged stronger after this period of ordeal, and increased missionary efforts farther afield. Missionaries established dioceses in the Arabian Peninsula and India (the Saint Thomas Christians). They made some advances in Egypt, despite the strong Miaphysite presence there. Missionaries entered Central Asia and had significant success converting local Turkic tribes.

The Anuradhapura Cross discovered in Sri Lanka strongly suggests a strong presence of Nestorian Christianity in Sri Lanka during the 6th century AD according to Humphrey Codrington, who based his claim on a 6th-century manuscript, Christian Topography, that mentions of a community of Persian Christians who were known to reside in Taprobanê (the Ancient Greek name for Sri Lanka).

Nestorian missionaries were firmly established in China during the early part of the Tang dynasty (618–907); the Chinese source known as the Nestorian Stele records a mission under a Persian proselyte named Alopen as introducing Nestorian Christianity to China in 635. The Jingjiao Documents (also described by the Japanese scholar P. Y. Saeki as &quot;Nestorian Documents&quot;) or Jesus Sutras are said to be connected with Alopen.

Following the Arab conquest of Persia, completed in 644, the Persian Church became a community under the Rashidun Caliphate. The church and its communities abroad grew larger under the caliphate. By the 10th century it had 15 metropolitan sees within the caliphate&#x27;s territories, and another five elsewhere, including in China and India. After that time, however, Nestorianism went into decline.

===Assyrian Church of the East===
In a 1996 article published in the &quot;Bulletin of the John Rylands Library&quot;, Fellow of the British Academy Sebastian Brock wrote: &quot;the term &#x27;Nestorian Church&#x27; has become the standard designation for the ancient oriental church which in the past called itself &#x27;The Church of the East&#x27;, but which today prefers the fuller title &#x27;The Assyrian Church of the East&#x27;. The Common Christological Declaration between the Catholic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East signed by Pope John Paul II and Mar Dinkha IV underlines the Chalcedonian Christological formulation as the expression of the common faith of these Churches and recognizes the legitimacy of the title &quot;Theotokos&quot;.&quot;

In a 2017 paper, Mar Awa Royel, Bishop of the Assyrian Church, stated the position of that church: &quot;After the Council of Ephesus (431), when Nestorius the patriarch of Constantinople was condemned for his views on the unity of the Godhead and the humanity in Christ, the Church of the East was branded as &#x27;Nestorian&#x27; on account of its refusal to anathematize the patriarch.&quot;

Several historical records suggest that the Assyrian Church of the East may have been in Sri Lanka between the mid-5th and 6th centuries.

== Modern discourse ==
The accusations of Nestorianism have been used in contemporary theological discourse. One notable example is the case of John MacArthur, as he has asserted that when Mary gave birth to Jesus, she did not give birth to God, but rather gave birth to Jesus in his humanity and that &quot;it’s heretical to call the blood of Jesus Christ the blood of God.&quot; These statements have been critiqued as resembling Nestorianism by other Christians.

<doc id="22068" wikidata="Q236606" url="?curid=22068" title="Naomi Klein">
<text>Naomi Klein (born May 8, 1970) is a Canadian author, social activist, and filmmaker known for her political analyses; support of ecofeminism, organized labour, and criticism of corporate globalization, fascism and capitalism. In 2021, Klein took up the UBC Professorship in Climate Justice, joining the University of British Columbia&#x27;s Department of Geography. She has been the co-director of the newly launched Centre for Climate Justice since 2021.

Klein first became known internationally for her alter-globalization book &quot;No Logo&quot; (1999). &quot;The Take&quot; (2004), a documentary film about Argentine workers&#x27; self-managed factories, written by her and directed by her husband Avi Lewis, further increased her profile. &quot;The Shock Doctrine&quot; (2007), a critical analysis of the history of neoliberal economics, solidified her standing as a prominent activist on the international stage and was adapted into a six-minute companion film by Alfonso and Jonás Cuarón, as well as a feature-length documentary by Michael Winterbottom. Klein&#x27;s &quot;This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate&quot; (2014) was a &quot;New York Times&quot; nonfiction bestseller and the winner of the Hilary Weston Writers&#x27; Trust Prize for Nonfiction.

In 2016, Klein was awarded the Sydney Peace Prize for her activism on climate justice. Klein frequently appears on global and national lists of top influential thinkers, including the 2014 Thought Leaders ranking compiled by the Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute, &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine&#x27;s world thinkers 2014 poll, and Maclean&#x27;s 2014 Power List. She was formerly a member of the board of directors of the climate activist group 350.org.

== Family==
Naomi Klein was born in Montreal, Quebec, into a Jewish family with a history of peace activism. Her parents were self-described hippies who emigrated from the United States in 1967 as war resisters to the Vietnam War. Her mother, documentary filmmaker Bonnie Sherr Klein, is best known for her anti-pornography film &quot;Not a Love Story&quot;. Her father, Michael Klein, is a physician and a member of Physicians for Social Responsibility. Her brother, Seth Klein, is an author and the former director of the British Columbia office of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.

Before World War II, her paternal grandparents were Communists, but they began to turn against the Soviet Union after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in 1939. In 1942, her grandfather, an animator at Disney, was fired after the 1941 strike, and had to switch to working in a shipyard instead. By 1956, they had abandoned communism. Klein&#x27;s father grew up surrounded by ideas of social justice and racial equality, but found it &quot;difficult and frightening to be the child of Communists&quot;, a so-called red diaper baby.

Klein&#x27;s husband, Avi Lewis, was born into a political and journalistic family. His grandfather, David Lewis, was an architect and leader of the federal New Democratic Party, while his father, Stephen Lewis, was a leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party. Avi Lewis works as a TV journalist and documentary filmmaker. He is also an associate professor in the Department of Geography at the University of British Columbia. The couple have one son, Toma.

==Early life and education==

Klein spent much of her teenage years in shopping malls, obsessed with designer labels. As a child and teenager, she found it &quot;very oppressive to have a very public feminist mother,&quot; and she rejected politics, instead embracing &quot;full-on consumerism&quot;.

She has attributed her change in worldview to two catalysts. One was when she was 17 and preparing for the University of Toronto, her mother had a stroke and became severely disabled. Naomi, her father, and her brother took care of Bonnie through the period in hospital and at home, making educational sacrifices to do so. That year off prevented her &quot;from being such a brat&quot;. The next year, after she had begun her studies at the University of Toronto, the second catalyst occurred: the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre of female engineering students, which proved to be a wake-up call to feminism.

Klein&#x27;s writing career began with contributions to &quot;The Varsity&quot;, a student newspaper, where she served as editor-in-chief. After her third year at the University of Toronto, she dropped out of university to take a job at &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, followed by an editorship at &quot;This Magazine&quot;. In 1995, she returned to the University of Toronto with the intention of finishing her degree but left to pursue an internship in journalism before acquiring the final credits required to complete her degree.

==Works==

===&quot;No Logo&quot;===
In 1999, Klein published the book &quot;No Logo&quot;, which for many became a manifesto of the anti-globalization movement. In it, she attacks brand-oriented consumer culture and the operations of large corporations. She also accuses several such corporations of unethically exploiting workers in the world&#x27;s poorest countries in pursuit of greater profits. In this book, Klein criticized Nike so severely that Nike published a point-by-point response. &quot;No Logo&quot; became an international bestseller, selling over one million copies in over 28 languages.

===&quot;Fences and Windows&quot;===
Klein&#x27;s &quot;Fences and Windows&quot; (2002) is a collection of her articles and speeches written on behalf of the anti-globalization movement (all proceeds from the book go to benefit activist organizations through The Fences and Windows Fund).

===&quot;The Take&quot;===

&quot;The Take&quot; (2004), a documentary film collaboration by Klein and Lewis, concerns factory workers in Argentina who took over a closed plant and resumed production, operating as a collective. The first African screening was in the Kennedy Road shack settlement in the South African city of Durban, where the Abahlali baseMjondolo movement began.

An article in &quot;Z Communications&quot; criticized &quot;The Take&quot; for its portrayal of the Argentine general and politician Juan Domingo Perón arguing that he was falsely portrayed as a social democrat.

===&quot;The Shock Doctrine&quot;===
Klein&#x27;s third book, &quot;The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism&quot;, was published on September 4, 2007. The book argues that the free market policies of Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman and the Chicago School of Economics have risen to prominence in countries such as Chile under Pinochet, Poland, and Russia under Yeltsin. The book also argues that policy initiatives (for instance, the privatization of Iraq&#x27;s economy under the Coalition Provisional Authority) were rushed through while the citizens of these countries were in shock from disasters, upheavals, or invasion. The book became an international and &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller and was translated into 28 languages.

Central to the book&#x27;s thesis is the contention that those who wish to implement unpopular free market policies now routinely do so by taking advantage of certain features of the aftermath of major disasters, be they economic, political, military or natural. The suggestion is that when a society experiences a major &#x27;shock&#x27; there is a widespread desire for a rapid and decisive response to correct the situation; this desire for bold and immediate action provides an opportunity for unscrupulous actors to implement policies which go far beyond a legitimate response to disaster. The book suggests that when the rush to act means the specifics of a response will go unscrutinized, that is the moment when unpopular and unrelated policies will intentionally be rushed into effect. The book appears to claim that these shocks are in some cases intentionally encouraged or even manufactured.

Klein identifies the &quot;shock doctrine&quot;, elaborating on Joseph Schumpeter, as the latest in capitalism&#x27;s phases of &quot;creative destruction&quot;.

&quot;The Shock Doctrine&quot; was adapted into a short film of the same name, released onto YouTube. The original is no longer available on the site; however, a duplicate was published in 2008. The film was directed by Jonás Cuarón, produced and co-written by his father Alfonso Cuarón. The original video was viewed over one million times. The director Michael Winterbottom, alongside Mat Whitecross, also produced a documentary on the book which premiered in 2009.

The publication of &quot;The Shock Doctrine&quot; increased Klein&#x27;s prominence, with &quot;The New Yorker&quot; judging her &quot;the most visible and influential figure on the American left—what Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky were thirty years ago.&quot; On February 24, 2009, the book was awarded the inaugural Warwick Prize for Writing from the University of Warwick in England. The prize carried a cash award of £50,000.

===&quot;This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate&quot;===

Klein&#x27;s fourth book, &quot;This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate&quot;, was published in September 2014. The book puts forth the argument that the hegemony of neoliberal market fundamentalism is blocking any serious reforms to halt climate change and protect the environment. Questioned about Klein&#x27;s claim that capitalism and controlling climate change were incompatible, Benoit Blarel, manager of the Environment and Natural Resources global practice at the World Bank, said that the write-off of fossil fuels necessary to control climate change &quot;will have a huge impact all over&quot; and that the World Bank was &quot;starting work on this&quot;. The book won the 2014 Hilary Weston Writers&#x27; Trust Prize for Nonfiction, and was a shortlisted nominee for the 2015 Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing.

===&quot;No Is Not Enough: Resisting Trump&#x27;s Shock Politics and Winning the World We Need&quot;===
Klein&#x27;s fifth book, &quot;No Is Not Enough: Resisting Trump&#x27;s Shock Politics and Winning the World We Need&quot; was published in June 2017. It has also been published internationally with the alternative subtitle &quot;Defeating the New Shock Politics&quot;. Writing in &quot;Geographical&quot;, Chris Fitch described this book as arguing for &quot;radical change, and for bold, ambitious policies, to provide a credible alternative to the world vision of the Trump White House, and avert the worst effects of climate change.&quot;

=== &quot;The Battle for Paradise: Puerto Rico Takes on the Disaster Capitalists&quot;===
&quot;The Battle for Paradise: Puerto Rico Takes on the Disaster Capitalists&quot; was released in June 2018 as a paperback and e-book. It covers what San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz refers to as &quot;a fight for our lives. Hurricanes Irma and María unmasked the colonialism we face in Puerto Rico, and the inequality it fosters, creating a fierce humanitarian crisis.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Haymarket Books/The Battle for Paradise official page&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, Klein applies principles outlined in her book &quot;The Shock Doctrine&quot; to the describe the handling of Puerto Rico in the post-Maria context. Klein&#x27;s main critiques are focused on the direction the Puerto Rican government has taken in terms of its recovery efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. She criticized government officials, like Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, who prioritized foreign investment interests all the while Puerto Ricans were left to fend for themselves or leave to the mainland U.S.. She notes that less than one year after the hurricane, Roselló “told a business audience in New York that Maria had created a ‘blank canvas’” ultimately implying that Puerto Rico would cater to &quot;disaster capitalists&quot; that aimed to profit off of the hurricane&#x27;s destruction.

===&quot;On Fire: The (Burning) Case for a Green New Deal &quot;===

In April 2019, Simon &amp; Schuster announced they would be publishing Klein&#x27;s seventh book, &quot;On Fire: The (Burning) Case for a Green New Deal&quot;, which was published on September 17, 2019. &quot;On Fire&quot; is a collection of essays focusing on climate change and the urgent actions needed to preserve the world. Klein relates her meeting with Greta Thunberg in the opening essay in which she discusses the entrance of young people into those speaking out for climate awareness and change. She supports the Green New Deal throughout the book and in the final essay she discusses the 2020 U.S. election stating: &quot;The stakes of the election are almost unbearably high. Its why I wrote the book and decided to put it out now and why I&#x27;ll be doing whatever I can to help push people toward supporting a candidate with the most ambitious Green New Deal platform—so that they win the primaries and then the general.&quot;

===&quot;Doppelganger: a Trip into the Mirror World&quot;===

Released in September 2023, &quot;Doppelganger&quot; is a memoir and social critique that contrasts Klein&#x27;s worldview with that of Naomi Wolf, a writer who is often mistaken for Klein and vice versa. In her 10-page introduction, Klein explains how she has been mistaken for the &quot;other Naomi&quot;, with whom she &quot;has been chronically confused for over a decade... I have been confused with Other Naomi for so long and so frequently that I have often felt that she was following me&quot;. For this reason, she started to follow what she calls Wolf&#x27;s &quot;new alliances with some of the most dangerous men on the planet&quot;, and wrote the book with the intention of using her doppelganger experience &quot;as a guide into and through what I have come to understand as our doppelganger culture&quot;.

Klein suggests that the Western world has fractured along political and ideological lines to such an extent that each side feels the other exists in a &quot;mirror world&quot;. The book received primarily positive reviews and debuted at number 8 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; hardcover nonfiction weekly best seller list.

On June 13, 2024, &quot;Doppelganger&quot; won Klein the inaugural Women&#x27;s Prize for Non-Fiction.

== Views ==

=== Iraq War criticism ===
Klein has written about the Iraq War. In &quot;Baghdad Year Zero&quot; (&quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, September 2004), Klein argues that, contrary to popular belief, the George W. Bush administration &quot;did&quot; have a clear plan for post-invasion Iraq: to build a completely unconstrained free market economy. She describes plans to allow foreigners to extract wealth from Iraq and the methods used to achieve those goals. Her &quot;Baghdad Year Zero&quot; was one of the inspirations for the 2008 film &quot;War, Inc.&quot;

Klein&#x27;s &quot;Bring Najaf to New York&quot; (&quot;The Nation&quot;, August 2004) argued that Muqtada Al Sadr&#x27;s Mahdi Army &quot;represents the overwhelmingly mainstream sentiment in Iraq&quot; and that, if he were elected, &quot;Sadr would try to turn Iraq into a theocracy like Iran,&quot; although his immediate demands were for &quot;direct elections and an end to foreign occupation&quot;.

=== Venezuela ===
Klein signed a 2004 petition titled &quot;We would vote for Hugo Chávez&quot;. In 2007, she described Venezuela under the Chávez government as a country where &quot;citizens had renewed their faith in the power of democracy to improve their lives,&quot; and described Venezuela as a place sheltered by Chávez&#x27;s policies from the economic shocks produced by capitalism. Rather, according to Klein, Chávez protected his country from financial crisis by building &quot;a zone of relative economic calm and predictability.&quot; According to reviewer Todd Gitlin, who described the overall argument of Klein&#x27;s book &quot;The Shock Doctrine&quot; (2007) as &quot;more right than wrong,&quot; Klein is &quot;a romantic,&quot; who expected that the Chávez government would produce a bright future in which worker-controlled co-operatives would run the economy. &quot;The Shock Doctrine&quot; was consistent with her prior thinking about globalization, and in that book she describes Chávez&#x27; policies as an example of public control of some sectors of the economy as protecting poor people from harm caused by globalization. In 2017, Mark Milke and conservative writer James Kirchick criticized Klein for her support of Chávez.

=== Criticism of Israel ===
In March 2008, Klein was the keynote speaker at the first national conference of the Alliance of Concerned Jewish Canadians (now Independent Jewish Voices). In January 2009, during the Gaza War, Klein supported the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel, arguing that &quot;the best strategy to end the increasingly bloody occupation is for Israel to become the target of the kind of global movement that put an end to apartheid in South Africa.&quot;

In summer 2009, on the occasion of the publication of the Hebrew translation of her book &quot;The Shock Doctrine&quot;, Klein visited Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza, combining the promotion of her book and the BDS campaign. In an interview to the Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot;, she emphasized that it was important &quot;not to boycott Israelis but rather to boycott the normalization of Israel and the conflict.&quot; In a speech in Ramallah on June 27, she apologized to Palestinians for not joining the BDS campaign earlier. Her remarks, particularly that &quot;[some Jews] even think we get one get-away-with-genocide-free card&quot; were characterized by Noam Schimmel, an op-ed columnist in &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, as &quot;violent&quot; and &quot;unethical&quot;, and as the &quot;most perverse of aspersions on Jews, an age-old stereotype of Jews as intrinsically evil and malicious.&quot;

Klein was also a spokesperson for the protest against the spotlight on Tel Aviv at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival, a spotlight that Klein said was a very selective and misleading portrait of Israel.

She has also served on the advisory board of the organization Jewish Voice for Peace.

In October 2023, in the context of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, she wrote:
At a “Seder in the Streets&quot; event April 23, 2024, held near Senator Chuck Schumer&#x27;s residence, Klein spoke about the contemporary meaning of Passover and its relation to the war. Using The Exodus story of Israelites worshipping the golden calf as an idol, she drew parallels to what she called &quot;the false idol of Zionism.&quot;

She said &quot;It is a false idol that takes our most profound biblical stories of justice and emancipation from slavery, the story of Passover itself, and turns them into brutalist weapons of colonial land theft, roadmaps for ethnic cleansing and genocide.&quot;
=== Environmentalism ===

By 2009, Klein&#x27;s attention had turned to environmentalism, with particular focus on climate change, the subject of her book &quot;This Changes Everything&quot; (2014). According to her website in 2016, the book and its accompanying film (released in 2015) would be about &quot;how the climate crisis can spur economic and political transformation.&quot;

She served on the board of directors of the non-profit group 350.org from April 7, 2011, through the fiscal year ending September 2018, and took part in their &quot;Do the Math&quot; tour in 2013, encouraging a divestment movement.

In an interview by Graeme Greene in &quot;New Internationalist&quot;, Klein rejected criticism that &quot;This Changes Everything&quot; politicized the climate issue and that the issue should be apolitical, asserting that such criticism reflected &quot;how blind so many within the mainstream climate discussion are to the fact that they themselves are fully immersed within the confines of neoliberalism; ... Its a fantasy that you could fundamentally shift the building blocks of your economy without engaging with politics.&quot;

She encouraged the Occupy movement to join forces with the environmental movement, saying the financial crisis and the climate crisis are similarly rooted in unrestrained corporate greed. She gave a speech at Occupy Wall Street where she described the world as &quot;upside down&quot;, where we act as if &quot;there is no end to what is actually finite—fossil fuels and the atmospheric space to absorb their emissions,&quot; and as if there are &quot;limits to what is actually bountiful—the financial resources to build the kind of society we need.&quot;
She has been a particularly vocal critic of the Athabasca oil sands in Alberta, describing it in a TED talk as a form of &quot;terrestrial skinning.&quot; On September 2, 2011, she attended the demonstration against the Keystone XL pipeline outside the White House and was arrested. Klein celebrated Obama&#x27;s decision to postpone a decision on the Keystone pipeline until 2013 pending an environmental review as a victory for the environmental movement.

She attended the Copenhagen Climate Summit of 2009. She put the blame for the failure of Copenhagen on President Barack Obama, and described her own country, Canada, as a &quot;climate criminal.&quot; She presented the Angry Mermaid Award (a satirical award designed to recognize the corporations who have best sabotaged the climate negotiations) to Monsanto.

Writing in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, she warned that the climate crisis constitutes a massive opportunity for disaster capitalists and corporations seeking to profit from crisis. But equally, the climate crisis &quot;can be a historic moment to usher in the next great wave of progressive change,&quot; or a so-called &quot;People&#x27;s Shock.&quot;

In November 2016, following the election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States, Klein called for an international campaign to impose economic sanctions on the United States if his administration refuses to abide by the terms of the Paris Agreement.

In October 2022, Klein published an article on &quot;The Intercept&quot; that addressed COP27 and the repression of the Egyptian government; the conference took place in Egypt, a country widely seen as repressive and autocratic. She goes on to state &quot;Sisi&#x27;s Egypt is making a big show of solar panels and biodegradable straws ... but in reality, the regime imprisons activists and bans research. The climate movement should not play along.&quot; calling it &#x27;greenwashing&#x27;. In an interview with &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;, she says “what is not welcome would be pointing out this enormous lucrative network of deals that the military itself is engaged in that are linked to fossil fuels, that are linked to destroying remaining green space in cities like Cairo”. Klein also stressed the release of prominent political prisoner and activist Alaa Abd El-Fattah.

==Other activities==

Klein contributes to &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;In These Times&quot;, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, &quot;This Magazine&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and is a senior contributor for &quot;The Intercept&quot;. She is a former Miliband Fellow and lectured at the London School of Economics on the anti-globalization movement. Her appointment as the inaugural Gloria Steinem Endowed Chair in Media, Culture and Feminist Studies at Rutgers University–New Brunswick began in October 2018 and ran for 3 years.

Klein ranked 11th in an internet poll of the top global intellectuals of 2005, a list of the world&#x27;s top 100 public intellectuals compiled by the &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine in conjunction with &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine. On Google Scholar which tracks academic articles, Klein has an overall h-index of 53 and her publications have been cited in the scholarly literature over 49,000 times as of May 2023. She was involved in 2010 G-20 Toronto summit protests, condemning police force and brutality. She spoke to a rally seeking the release of protesters in front of police headquarters on June 28, 2010.

In October 2011, she visited Occupy Wall Street and gave a speech declaring the protest movement &quot;the most important thing in the world&quot;. On November 10, 2011, she participated in a panel discussion about the future of Occupy Wall Street with four other panelists, including Michael Moore, William Greider, and Rinku Sen, in which she stressed the crucial nature of the evolving movement.
Klein also made an appearance in the British radio show &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; on BBC Radio 4 in 2017.

Klein was a key instigator of the Leap Manifesto, a political manifesto issued in the context of the 2015 Canadian federal election focused on addressing the climate crisis through restructuring the Canadian economy and dealing with issues of income and wealth inequality, racism, and colonialism. The manifesto has been noted as an influence in the development of the Green New Deal and eventually led to the establishment of The Leap, an organization that works to promote the realization of the principles behind the original manifesto.

In November 2019, along with other public figures, Klein signed a letter supporting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn describing him as &quot;a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world&quot; and endorsed him in the 2019 UK general election.

<doc id="22071" wikidata="Q188724" url="?curid=22071" title="Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug">
<text>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are members of a therapeutic drug class which reduces pain, decreases inflammation, decreases fever, and prevents blood clots. Side effects depend on the specific drug, its dose and duration of use, but largely include an increased risk of gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeds, heart attack, and kidney disease.

The term &quot;non-steroidal&quot;, common from around 1960, distinguishes these drugs from corticosteroids, another class of anti-inflammatory drugs, which during the 1950s had acquired a bad reputation due to overuse and side-effect problems after their introduction in 1948.

NSAIDs work by inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase enzymes (the COX-1 and COX-2 isoenzymes). In cells, these enzymes are involved in the synthesis of key biological mediators, namely prostaglandins, which are involved in inflammation, and thromboxanes, which are involved in blood clotting.

There are two general types of NSAIDs available: non-selective and COX-2 selective. Most NSAIDs are non-selective, and inhibit the activity of both COX-1 and COX-2. These NSAIDs, while reducing inflammation, also inhibit platelet aggregation and increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeds. COX-2 selective inhibitors have fewer gastrointestinal side effects, but promote thrombosis, and some of these agents substantially increase the risk of heart attack. As a result, certain COX-2 selective inhibitors—such as rofecoxib—are no longer used due to the high risk of undiagnosed vascular disease. These differential effects are due to the different roles and tissue localisations of each COX isoenzyme. By inhibiting physiological COX activity, NSAIDs may cause deleterious effects on kidney function, and, perhaps as a result of water and sodium retention and decreases in renal blood flow, may lead to heart problems. In addition, NSAIDs can blunt the production of erythropoietin, resulting in anaemia, since haemoglobin needs this hormone to be produced.

The most prominent NSAIDs are aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen; all available over the counter (OTC) in most countries. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is generally not considered an NSAID because it has only minor anti-inflammatory activity. Paracetamol treats pain mainly by blocking COX-2 and inhibiting endocannabinoid reuptake almost exclusively within the brain, and only minimally in the rest of the body.

==Medical uses==
NSAIDs are often suggested for the treatment of acute or chronic conditions where pain and inflammation are present. NSAIDs are generally used for the symptomatic relief of the following conditions:
*Osteoarthritis
*Rheumatoid arthritis
*Mild-to-moderate pain due to inflammation and tissue injury
*Low back pain
*Inflammatory arthropathies (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis)
*Tennis elbow
*Headache
*Migraine
*Acute gout
*Dysmenorrhea (menstrual pain)
*Metastatic bone pain
*Postoperative pain
*Muscle stiffness and pain due to Parkinson&#x27;s disease
*Pyrexia (fever)
*Ileus
*Renal colic
*Macular edema
*Traumatic injury

===Chronic pain and cancer-related pain===
The effectiveness of NSAIDs for treating non-cancer chronic pain and cancer-related pain in children and adolescents is not clear. There have not been sufficient numbers of high-quality randomised controlled trials conducted.

===Inflammation===
Differences in anti-inflammatory activity between the various individual NSAIDs are small, but there is considerable variation among individual patients in therapeutic response and tolerance to these drugs. About 60% of patients will respond to any NSAID; of the others, those who do not respond to one may well respond to another. Pain relief starts soon after taking the first dose, and a full analgesic effect should normally be obtained within a week, whereas an anti-inflammatory effect may not be achieved (or may not be clinically assessable) for up to three weeks. If appropriate responses are not obtained within these times, another NSAID should be tried.

===Surgical pain===
Pain following surgery can be significant, and many people require strong pain medications such as opioids. There is some low-certainty evidence that starting NSAID painkiller medications in adults early, before surgery, may help reduce post-operative pain, and also reduce the dose or quantity of opioid medications required after surgery. Any increase risk of surgical bleeding, bleeding in the gastrointestinal system, myocardial infarctions, or injury to the kidneys has not been well studied. When used in combination with paracetamol, the analgesic effect on post-operative pain may be improved.

===Aspirin===
Aspirin, the only NSAID able to irreversibly inhibit COX-1, is also indicated for antithrombosis through inhibition of platelet aggregation. This is useful for the management of arterial thrombosis, and prevention of adverse cardiovascular events like heart attacks. Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by inhibiting the action of thromboxane A2.

===Dentistry===
NSAIDs are useful in the management of post-operative dental pain following invasive dental procedures such as dental extraction. When not contra-indicated, they are favoured over the use of paracetamol alone due to the anti-inflammatory effect they provide. There is weak evidence suggesting that taking pre-operative analgesia can reduce the length of post operative pain associated with placing orthodontic spacers under local anaesthetic.

=== Alzheimer&#x27;s disease ===
Based on observational studies and randomized controlled trials, NSAID use is not effective for the treatment or prevention of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==Contraindications==
NSAIDs may be used with caution by people with the following conditions:
*Persons who are over age 50, and who have a family history of gastrointestinal (GI) problems
*Persons who have had previous gastrointestinal problems from NSAID use

NSAIDs should usually be avoided by people with the following conditions:
*Peptic ulcer or stomach bleeding
*Uncontrolled hypertension
*Kidney disease
*People with inflammatory bowel disease
*Past transient ischemic attack (excluding aspirin)
*Past stroke (excluding aspirin)
*Past myocardial infarction (excluding aspirin)
*Coronary artery disease (excluding aspirin)
*Undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery
*Congestive heart failure (excluding low-dose aspirin)
*In third trimester of pregnancy
*Persons who have undergone gastric bypass surgery
*Persons who have a history of allergic or allergic-like NSAID hypersensitivity reactions, e.g. aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease

==Adverse effects==
The widespread use of NSAIDs has meant that the adverse effects of these drugs have become increasingly common. Use of NSAIDs increases risk of a range of gastrointestinal (GI) problems, kidney disease and adverse cardiovascular events. As commonly used for post-operative pain, there is evidence of increased risk of kidney complications. Their use following gastrointestinal surgery remains controversial, given mixed evidence of increased risk of leakage from any bowel anastomosis created.

An estimated 10–20% of people taking NSAIDs experience indigestion. In the 1990s, high doses of prescription NSAIDs were associated with serious upper gastrointestinal adverse events, including bleeding.

NSAIDs, like all medications, may interact with other medications. For example, concurrent use of NSAIDs and quinolone antibiotics may increase the risk of quinolones&#x27; adverse central nervous system effects, including seizure.

There is an argument over the benefits and risks of NSAIDs for treating chronic musculoskeletal pain. Each drug has a benefit-risk profile and balancing the risk of no treatment with the competing potential risks of various therapies should be considered. For people over the age of 65 years old, the balance between the benefits of pain-relief medications such as NSAIDS and the potential for adverse effects has not been well determined.

There is some evidence suggesting that, for some people, use of NSAIDs (or other anti-inflammatories) may contribute to the initiation of chronic pain.

Side effects are dose-dependent, and in many cases severe enough to pose the risk of ulcer perforation, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and death, limiting the use of NSAID therapy. An estimated 10–20% of NSAID patient&#x27;s experience dyspepsia, and NSAID-associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events are estimated to result in 103,000 hospitalizations and 16,500 deaths per year in the United States, and represent 43% of drug-related emergency visits. Many of these events are avoidable; a review of physician visits and prescriptions estimated that unnecessary prescriptions for NSAIDs were written in 42% of visits.

Aspirin should not be taken by people who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. People with kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys&#x27; ability to excrete uric acid, and thus may exacerbate these conditions.

===Combinational risk===

If a COX-2 inhibitor is taken, a traditional NSAID (prescription or over-the-counter) should not be taken at the same time.

Rofecoxib (Vioxx) was shown to produce significantly fewer gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions (ADRs) compared with naproxen. The study, the VIGOR trial, raised the issue of the cardiovascular safety of the coxibs (COX-2 inhibitors). A statistically significant increase in the incidence of myocardial infarctions was observed in patients on rofecoxib. Further data, from the APPROVe trial, showed a statistically significant relative risk of cardiovascular events of 1.97 versus placebo—which caused a worldwide withdrawal of rofecoxib in October 2004.

Use of methotrexate together with NSAIDs in rheumatoid arthritis is safe, if adequate monitoring is done.

===Cardiovascular===

NSAIDs, aside from aspirin, increase the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. This occurs at least within a week of use. They are not recommended in those who have had a previous heart attack as they increase the risk of death or recurrent MI. Evidence indicates that naproxen may be the least harmful out of these.

NSAIDs aside from (low-dose) aspirin are associated with a doubled risk of heart failure in people without a history of cardiac disease. In people with such a history, use of NSAIDs (aside from low-dose aspirin) was associated with a more than 10-fold increase in heart failure. If this link is proven causal, researchers estimate that NSAIDs would be responsible for up to 20 percent of hospital admissions for congestive heart failure. In people with heart failure, NSAIDs increase mortality risk (hazard ratio) by approximately 1.2–1.3 for naproxen and ibuprofen, 1.7 for rofecoxib and celecoxib, and 2.1 for diclofenac.

On 9 July 2015, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) toughened warnings of increased heart attack and stroke risk associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) &quot;other than aspirin&quot;.

===Possible erectile dysfunction risk===

A 2005 Finnish survey study found an association between long term (over three months) use of NSAIDs and erectile dysfunction.

A 2011 publication in &quot;The Journal of Urology&quot; received widespread publicity. According to the study, men who used NSAIDs regularly were at significantly increased risk of erectile dysfunction. A link between NSAID use and erectile dysfunction still existed after controlling for several conditions. However, the study was observational and not controlled, with low original participation rate, potential participation bias, and other uncontrolled factors. The authors warned against drawing any conclusion regarding cause.

===Gastrointestinal===

The main adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with NSAID use relate to direct and indirect irritation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. NSAIDs cause a dual assault on the GI tract: the acidic molecules directly irritate the gastric mucosa, and inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 reduces the levels of protective prostaglandins. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the GI tract causes increased gastric acid secretion, diminished bicarbonate secretion, diminished mucus secretion and diminished trophic effects on the epithelial mucosa.

Common gastrointestinal side effects include:
* Nausea or vomiting
* Indigestion
* Gastric ulceration or bleeding
* Diarrhea

Clinical NSAID ulcers are related to the systemic effects of NSAID administration. Such damage occurs irrespective of the route of administration of the NSAID (e.g., oral, rectal, or parenteral) and can occur even in people who have achlorhydria.

Ulceration risk increases with therapy duration, and with higher doses. To minimize GI side effects, it is prudent to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time—a practice that studies show is often not followed. Over 50% of patients who take NSAIDs have sustained some mucosal damage to their small intestine.

The risk and rate of gastric adverse effects is different depending on the type of NSAID medication a person is taking. Indomethacin, ketoprofen, and piroxicam use appear to lead to the highest rate of gastric adverse effects, while ibuprofen (lower doses) and diclofenac appear to have lower rates.

Certain NSAIDs, such as aspirin, have been marketed in enteric-coated formulations that manufacturers claim reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal ADRs. Similarly, some believe that rectal formulations may reduce gastrointestinal ADRs. However, consistent with the systemic mechanism of such ADRs, and in clinical practice, these formulations have not demonstrated a reduced risk of GI ulceration.

Numerous &quot;gastro-protective&quot; drugs have been developed with the goal of preventing gastrointestinal toxicity in people who need to take NSAIDs on a regular basis. Gastric adverse effects may be reduced by taking medications that suppress acid production such as proton pump inhibitors (e.g.: omeprazole and esomeprazole), or by treatment with a drug that mimics prostaglandin in order to restore the lining of the GI tract (e.g.: a prostaglandin analog misoprostol). Diarrhea is a common side effect of misoprostol; however, higher doses of misoprostol have been shown to reduce the risk of a person having a complication related to a gastric ulcer while taking NSAIDs. While these techniques may be effective, they are expensive for maintenance therapy.

Hydrogen sulfide NSAID hybrids prevent the gastric ulceration/bleeding associated with taking the NSAIDs alone. Hydrogen sulfide is known to have a protective effect on the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal system.

===Inflammatory bowel disease===
NSAIDs should be used with caution in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn&#x27;s disease or ulcerative colitis) due to their tendency to cause gastric bleeding and form ulceration in the gastric lining.

===Renal===
NSAIDs are also associated with a fairly high incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) on the kidney and over time can lead to chronic kidney disease. The mechanism of these kidney ADRs is due to changes in kidney blood flow. Prostaglandins normally dilate the afferent arterioles of the glomeruli. This helps maintain normal glomerular perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), an indicator of kidney function. This is particularly important in kidney failure where the kidney is trying to maintain renal perfusion pressure by elevated angiotensin II levels. At these elevated levels, angiotensin II also constricts the afferent arteriole into the glomerulus in addition to the efferent arteriole it normally constricts. Since NSAIDs block this prostaglandin-mediated effect of afferent arteriole dilation, particularly in kidney failure, NSAIDs cause unopposed constriction of the afferent arteriole and decreased RPF (renal perfusion flow) and GFR.

Common ADRs associated with altered kidney function include:
* Sodium and fluid retention
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)

These agents may also cause kidney impairment, especially in combination with other nephrotoxic agents. Kidney failure is especially a risk if the patient is also concomitantly taking an ACE inhibitor (which removes angiotensin II&#x27;s vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole) and a diuretic (which drops plasma volume, and thereby RPF)—the so-called &quot;triple whammy&quot; effect.

In rarer instances NSAIDs may also cause more severe kidney conditions:
* Interstitial nephritis
* Nephrotic syndrome
* Acute kidney injury
* Acute tubular necrosis
* Renal papillary necrosis

NSAIDs in combination with excessive use of phenacetin or paracetamol (acetaminophen) may lead to analgesic nephropathy.

===Photosensitivity===

Photosensitivity is a commonly overlooked adverse effect of many of the NSAIDs. The 2-arylpropionic acids are the most likely to produce photosensitivity reactions, but other NSAIDs have also been implicated including piroxicam, diclofenac, and benzydamine.

Benoxaprofen, since withdrawn due to its liver toxicity, was the most photoactive NSAID observed. The mechanism of photosensitivity, responsible for the high photoactivity of the 2-arylpropionic acids, is the ready decarboxylation of the carboxylic acid moiety. The specific absorbance characteristics of the different chromophoric 2-aryl substituents, affects the decarboxylation mechanism.

===During pregnancy===

While NSAIDs as a class are not direct teratogens, use of NSAIDs in late pregnancy can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and kidney ADRs in the fetus. Thus, NSAIDs are not recommended during the third trimester of pregnancy because of the increased risk of premature constriction of the ductus arteriosus. Additionally, they are linked with premature birth and miscarriage. Aspirin, however, is used together with heparin in pregnant women with antiphospholipid syndrome. Additionally, indomethacin can be used in pregnancy to treat polyhydramnios by reducing fetal urine production via inhibiting fetal renal blood flow.

In contrast, paracetamol (acetaminophen) is regarded as being safe and well tolerated during pregnancy, but Leffers et al. released a study in 2010, indicating that there may be associated male infertility in the unborn. Doses should be taken as prescribed, due to risk of liver toxicity with overdoses.

In France, the country&#x27;s health agency contraindicates the use of NSAIDs, including aspirin, after the sixth month of pregnancy.

In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies which can then lead to low amniotic fluid levels, as a result of the use of NSAIDs. They are recommending avoiding the use of NSAIDs by pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy.

===Allergy and allergy-like hypersensitivity reactions===

A variety of allergic or allergic-like NSAID hypersensitivity reactions follow the ingestion of NSAIDs. These hypersensitivity reactions differ from the other adverse reactions listed here which are toxicity reactions, i.e. unwanted reactions that result from the pharmacological action of a drug, are dose-related, and can occur in any treated individual; hypersensitivity reactions are idiosyncratic reactions to a drug. Some NSAID hypersensitivity reactions are truly allergic in origin: 1) repetitive IgE-mediated urticarial skin eruptions, angioedema, and anaphylaxis following immediately to hours after ingesting one structural type of NSAID but not after ingesting structurally unrelated NSAIDs; and 2) Comparatively mild to moderately severe T cell-mediated delayed onset (usually more than 24 hour), skin reactions such as maculopapular rash, fixed drug eruptions, photosensitivity reactions, delayed urticaria, and contact dermatitis; or 3) far more severe and potentially life-threatening t-cell-mediated delayed systemic reactions such as the DRESS syndrome, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, the Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Other NSAID hypersensitivity reactions are allergy-like symptoms but do not involve true allergic mechanisms; rather, they appear due to the ability of NSAIDs to alter the metabolism of arachidonic acid in favor of forming metabolites that promote allergic symptoms. Affected individuals may be abnormally sensitive to these provocative metabolites or overproduce them and typically are susceptible to a wide range of structurally dissimilar NSAIDs, particularly those that inhibit COX1. Symptoms, which develop immediately to hours after ingesting any of various NSAIDs that inhibit COX-1, are: 1) exacerbations of asthmatic and rhinitis (see aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease) symptoms in individuals with a history of asthma or rhinitis and 2) exacerbation or first-time development of wheals or angioedema in individuals with or without a history of chronic urticarial lesions or angioedema.

=== Possible effects on bone and soft tissue healing ===
It has been hypothesized that NSAIDs may delay healing from bone and soft-tissue injuries by inhibiting inflammation. On the other hand, it has also been hypothesized that NSAIDs might speed recovery from soft tissue injuries by preventing inflammatory processes from damaging adjacent, non-injured muscles.

There is moderate evidence that they delay bone healing. Their overall effect on soft-tissue healing is unclear.

=== Ototoxicity ===
Long-term use of NSAID analgesics and paracetamol is associated with an increased risk of hearing loss.

===Other===
The use of NSAIDs for analgesia following gastrointestinal surgery remains controversial, given mixed evidence of an increased risk of leakage from any bowel anastomosis created. This risk may vary according to the class of NSAID prescribed.

Common adverse drug reactions (ADR), other than listed above, include: raised liver enzymes, headache, dizziness. Uncommon ADRs include an abnormally high level of potassium in the blood, confusion, spasm of the airways, and rash. Ibuprofen may also rarely cause irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. NSAIDs are also implicated in some cases of Stevens–Johnson syndrome.

Most NSAIDs penetrate poorly into the central nervous system (CNS). However, the COX enzymes are expressed constitutively in some areas of the CNS, meaning that even limited penetration may cause adverse effects such as somnolence and dizziness.

NSAIDs may increase the risk of bleeding in patients with Dengue fever For this reason, NSAIDs are only available with a prescription in India.

In very rare cases, ibuprofen can cause aseptic meningitis.

As with other drugs, allergies to NSAIDs might exist. While many allergies are specific to one NSAID, up to 1 in 5 people may have unpredictable cross-reactive allergic responses to other NSAIDs as well.

===Immune response===

Although small doses generally have little to no effect on the immune system, large doses of NSAIDs significantly suppress the production of immune cells. As NSAIDs affect prostaglandins, they affect the production of most fast growing cells. This includes immune cells. Unlike corticosteroids, they do not directly suppress the immune system and so their effect on the immune system is not immediately obvious. They suppress the production of new immune cells, but leave existing immune cells functional. Large doses slowly reduce the immune response as the immune cells are renewed at a much lower rate. Causing a gradual reduction of the immune system, much slower and less noticeable than the immediate effect of Corticosteroids. The effect significantly increases with dosage, in a nearly exponential rate. Doubling of dose reduced cells by nearly four times. Increasing dose by five times reduced cell counts to only a few percent of normal levels. This is likely why the effect was not immediately obvious in low dose trials, as the effect is not apparent until much higher dosages are tested.

== Interactions ==
NSAIDs reduce kidney blood flow and thereby decrease the efficacy of diuretics, and inhibit the elimination of lithium and methotrexate.

NSAIDs cause decreased ability to form blood clots, which can increase the risk of bleeding when combined with other drugs that also decrease blood clotting, such as warfarin.

NSAIDs may aggravate hypertension (high blood pressure) and thereby antagonize the effect of antihypertensives, such as ACE inhibitors.

NSAIDs may interfere and reduce effectiveness of SSRI antidepressants through inhibiting TNFα and IFNγ, both of which are cytokine derivatives. NSAIDs, when used in combination with SSRIs, increase the risk of adverse gastrointestinal effects. NSAIDs, when used in combination with SSRIs, increase the risk of internal bleeding and brain hemorrhages.

Various widely used NSAIDs enhance endocannabinoid signaling by blocking the anandamide-degrading membrane enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH).

NSAIDs may reduce the effectiveness of antibiotics. An in-vitro study on cultured bacteria found that adding NSAIDs to antibiotics reduced their effectiveness by around 20%.

The concomitant use of NSAIDs with alcohol and/or tobacco products significantly increases the already elevated risk of peptic ulcers during NSAID therapy.

==Mechanism of action==
Most NSAIDs act as nonselective inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, inhibiting both the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) isoenzymes. This inhibition is competitively reversible (albeit at varying degrees of reversibility), as opposed to the mechanism of aspirin, which is irreversible inhibition. COX catalyzes the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane from arachidonic acid (itself derived from the cellular phospholipid bilayer by phospholipase A2). Prostaglandins act (among other things) as messenger molecules in the process of inflammation. This mechanism of action was elucidated in 1970 by John Vane (1927–2004), who received a Nobel Prize for his work (see Mechanism of action of aspirin).

COX-1 is a constitutively expressed enzyme with a &quot;house-keeping&quot; role in regulating many normal physiological processes. One of these is in the stomach lining, where prostaglandins serve a protective role, preventing the stomach mucosa from being eroded by its own acid. COX-2 is an enzyme facultatively expressed in inflammation, and it is inhibition of COX-2 that produces the desirable effects of NSAIDs.

When nonselective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen) lower stomach prostaglandin levels, ulcers of the stomach or duodenum and internal bleeding can result. The discovery of COX-2 led to research to the development of selective COX-2 inhibiting drugs that do not cause gastric problems characteristic of older NSAIDs.

NSAIDs have been studied in various assays to understand how they affect each of these enzymes. While the assays reveal differences, unfortunately, different assays provide differing ratios.

Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is not considered an NSAID because it has little anti-inflammatory activity. It treats pain mainly by blocking COX-2 mostly in the central nervous system, but not much in the rest of the body.

However, many aspects of the mechanism of action of NSAIDs remain unexplained, and for this reason, further COX pathways are hypothesized. The COX-3 pathway was believed to fill some of this gap but recent findings make it appear unlikely that it plays any significant role in humans and alternative explanation models are proposed.

NSAIDs interact with the endocannabinoid system and its endocannabinoids, as COX2 have been shown to utilize endocannabinoids as substrates, and may have a key role in both the therapeutic effects and adverse effects of NSAIDs, as well as in NSAID-induced placebo responses.

NSAIDs are also used in the acute pain caused by gout because they inhibit urate crystal phagocytosis besides inhibition of prostaglandin synthase.

===Antipyretic activity===

NSAIDs have antipyretic activity and can be used to treat fever. Fever is caused by elevated levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which alters the firing rate of neurons within the hypothalamus that control thermoregulation. Antipyretics work by inhibiting the enzyme COX, which causes the general inhibition of prostanoid biosynthesis (PGE2) within the hypothalamus. PGE2 signals to the hypothalamus to increase the body&#x27;s thermal setpoint. Ibuprofen has been shown more effective as an antipyretic than paracetamol (acetaminophen).
Arachidonic acid is the precursor substrate for cyclooxygenase leading to the production of prostaglandins F, D, and E.

==Classification==

NSAIDs can be classified based on their chemical structure or mechanism of action. Older NSAIDs were known long before their mechanism of action was elucidated and were for this reason classified by chemical structure or origin. Newer substances are more often classified by mechanism of action.

* H-harpagide in figwort or devil&#x27;s claw

===Chirality===

Most NSAIDs are chiral molecules; diclofenac and the oxicams are exceptions. However, the majority are prepared as racemic mixtures. Typically, only a single enantiomer is pharmacologically active. For some drugs (typically profens), an isomerase enzyme &quot;in vivo&quot; converts the inactive enantiomer into the active form, although its activity varies widely in individuals. This phenomenon is likely responsible for the poor correlation between NSAID efficacy and plasma concentration observed in older studies when specific analysis of the active enantiomer was not performed.

Ibuprofen and ketoprofen are now available in single-enantiomer preparations (dexibuprofen and dexketoprofen), which purport to offer quicker onset and an improved side-effect profile. Naproxen has always been marketed as the single active enantiomer.

===Main practical differences===
NSAIDs within a group tend to have similar characteristics and tolerability. There is little difference in clinical efficacy among the NSAIDs when used at equivalent doses. Rather, differences among compounds usually relate to dosing regimens (related to the compound&#x27;s elimination half-life), route of administration, and tolerability profile.

Regarding adverse effects, selective COX-2 inhibitors have lower risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. With the exception of naproxen, nonselective NSAIDs increase the risk of having a heart attack. Some data also supports that the partially selective nabumetone is less likely to cause gastrointestinal events.

A consumer report noted that ibuprofen, naproxen, and salsalate are less expensive than other NSAIDs, and essentially as effective and safe when used appropriately to treat osteoarthritis and pain.

==Pharmacokinetics==

Most nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are weak acids, with a pKa of 3–5. They are absorbed well from the stomach and intestinal mucosa. They are highly protein-bound in plasma (typically &gt;95%), usually to albumin, so that their volume of distribution typically approximates to plasma volume. Most NSAIDs are metabolized in the liver by oxidation and conjugation to inactive metabolites that typically are excreted in the urine, though some drugs are partially excreted in bile. Metabolism may be abnormal in certain disease states, and accumulation may occur even with normal dosage.

NSAIDs can also be divided into short-acting (plasma half-life less than 6 h) such as aspirin, diclofenac and ibuprofen and long-acting (half-life approximately greater than 10 h) such as naproxen, celecoxib.

==History==

It is widely believed that naturally occurring salicin in willow trees and other plants was used by the ancients as a form of analgesic or anti-inflammatory drug, but this story, although compelling, is not entirely true. Hippocrates does not mention willow at all. Dioscorides&#x27;s &quot;De materia medica&quot; was arguably the most influential herbal from Roman to Medieval times but, if he mentions willow at all (there is doubt about the identity of &#x27;Itea&#x27;), then he used the ashes, steeped in vinegar, as a treatment for corns, which corresponds well with modern uses of salicylic acid.

Willow bark (from trees of the &quot;Salix&quot; genus) was widely known to be used as a medicine by multiple First Nations communities. The bark would be chewed or steeped in water for its pain relieving and antipyretic effects. The effects are a result of the bark&#x27;s salicin content. Meadowsweet, another plant to contain salicin, has strong roots in British folk medicine for the same maladies. Willow bark was first reported in Western science by Edward Stone in 1763 as a treatment for ague (fever) according to the pseudoscientific doctrine of signatures.

In the body, salicin is turned into salicylic acid, which produces the antipyretic and analgesic effects that the plants are known for.

Salicin was first isolated by Johann Andreas Buchner in 1827. By 1829, French chemist Henri Leroux had improved the extraction process to obtain about 30g of purified salicin from 1.5kg of willow bark. By hydrolysis, salicin releases glucose and salicyl alcohol which can be converted into salicylic acid, both in vivo and through chemical methods. In 1869, Hermann Kolbe synthesised salicylic acid, although it was too acidic for the gastric mucosa. The reaction used to synthesise aromatic acid from a phenol in the presence of is known as the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction.
By 1897, the German chemist Felix Hoffmann and the Bayer company prompted a new age of pharmacology by converting salicylic acid into acetylsalicylic acid—named aspirin by Heinrich Dreser. Other NSAIDs like ibuprofen were developed from the 1950s forward.
In 2001, NSAIDs accounted for 70,000,000 prescriptions and 30billion over-the-counter doses sold annually in the United States.

==Veterinary use==
Research supports the use of NSAIDs for the control of pain associated with veterinary procedures such as dehorning and castration of calves. The best effect is obtained by combining a short-term local anesthetic such as lidocaine with an NSAID acting as a longer term analgesic. However, as different species have varying reactions to different medications in the NSAID family, little of the existing research data can be extrapolated to animal species other than those specifically studied, and the relevant government agency in one area sometimes prohibits uses approved in other jurisdictions.

In the United States, meloxicam is approved for use only in canines, whereas (due to concerns about liver damage) it carries warnings against its use in cats except for one-time use during surgery. In spite of these warnings, meloxicam is frequently prescribed &quot;off-label&quot; for non-canine animals including cats and livestock species. In other countries, for example The European Union (EU), there is a label claim for use in cats.

<text>In computational complexity theory, the class NC (for &quot;Nick&#x27;s Class&quot;) is the set of decision problems decidable in polylogarithmic time on a parallel computer with a polynomial number of processors. In other words, a problem with input size &quot;n&quot; is in NC if there exist constants &quot;c&quot; and &quot;k&quot; such that it can be solved in time using parallel processors. Stephen Cook coined the name &quot;Nick&#x27;s class&quot; after Nick Pippenger, who had done extensive research on circuits with polylogarithmic depth and polynomial size.

Just as the class [[P (complexity)|P]] can be thought of as the tractable problems (Cobham&#x27;s thesis), so NC can be thought of as the problems that can be efficiently solved on a parallel computer. NC is a subset of P because polylogarithmic parallel computations can be simulated by polynomial-time sequential ones. It is unknown whether NC = P, but most researchers suspect this to be false, meaning that there are probably some tractable problems that are &quot;inherently sequential&quot; and cannot significantly be sped up by using parallelism. Just as the class [[NP-complete]] can be thought of as &quot;probably intractable&quot;, so the class [[P-complete]], when using NC reductions, can be thought of as &quot;probably not parallelizable&quot; or &quot;probably inherently sequential&quot;.

The parallel computer in the definition can be assumed to be a &quot;parallel, random-access machine&quot; (PRAM). That is a parallel computer with a central pool of memory, and any processor can access any bit of memory in constant time. The definition of NC is not affected by the choice of how the PRAM handles simultaneous access to a single bit by more than one processor. It can be CRCW, CREW, or EREW. See PRAM for descriptions of those models.

Equivalently, NC can be defined as those decision problems decidable by a uniform Boolean circuit (which can be calculated from the length of the input, for NC, we suppose we can compute the Boolean circuit of size &quot;n&quot; in logarithmic space in &quot;n&quot;) with polylogarithmic depth and a polynomial number of gates with a maximum fan-in of 2.

RNC is a class extending NC with access to randomness.

== Problems in NC ==
As with P, by a slight abuse of language, one might classify function problems and search problems as being in NC. NC is known to include many problems, including
* Integer addition, multiplication and division;
* Matrix multiplication, determinant, inverse, rank;
* Polynomial GCD, by a reduction to linear algebra using Sylvester matrix
* Finding a maximal matching.

Often algorithms for those problems had to be separately invented and could not be naïvely adapted from well-known algorithms – Gaussian elimination and Euclidean algorithm rely on operations performed in sequence. One might contrast ripple carry adder with a carry-lookahead adder.

=== Example ===
An example of problem in NC1 is the parity check on a bit string. The problem consists in counting the number of 1s in a string made of 1 and 0. A simple solution consists in summing all the string&#x27;s bits. Since addition is associative, formula_1. Recursively applying such property, it is possible to build a binary tree of length formula_2 in which every sum between two bits formula_3 and formula_4 is expressible by means of basic logical operators, e.g. through the boolean expression formula_5.

== The NC hierarchy ==
NC&quot;i&quot; is the class of decision problems decidable by uniform boolean circuits with a polynomial number of gates of at most two inputs and depth , or the class of decision problems solvable in time &quot;O&quot;((log &quot;n&quot;)&quot;i&quot;) on a parallel computer with a polynomial number of processors. Clearly, we have

:formula_6

which forms the NC-hierarchy.

We can relate the NC classes to the space classes L and NL and AC.

:formula_7

The NC classes are related to the AC classes, which are defined similarly, but with gates having unbounded fan-in. For each &quot;i&quot;, we have

:formula_8

As an immediate consequence of this, we have that NC = AC.
It is known that both inclusions are strict for &quot;i&quot; = 0.

Similarly, we have that NC is equivalent to the problems solvable on an alternating Turing machine restricted to at most two options at each step with &quot;O&quot;(log &quot;n&quot;) space and formula_9 alternations.

=== Open problem: Is NC proper? ===
One major open question in complexity theory is whether or not every containment in the NC hierarchy is proper. It was observed by Papadimitriou that, if NC&quot;i&quot; = NC&quot;i&quot;+1 for some &quot;i&quot;, then NC&quot;i&quot; = NC&quot;j&quot; for all &quot;j&quot; ≥ &quot;i&quot;, and as a result, NC&quot;i&quot; = NC. This observation is known as NC-hierarchy collapse because even a single equality in the chain of containments
:formula_10
implies that the entire NC hierarchy &quot;collapses&quot; down to some level &quot;i&quot;. Thus, there are 2 possibilities:

# formula_11
# formula_12

It is widely believed that (1) is the case, although no proof as to the truth of either statement has yet been discovered.

===NC0===
The special class NC&quot;0&quot; operates only on a constant length of input bits. It is therefore described as the class of functions definable by uniform boolean circuits with constant depth and bounded fan-in.

==Barrington&#x27;s theorem==
A branching program with &quot;n&quot; variables of width &quot;k&quot; and length &quot;m&quot; consists of a sequence of &quot;m&quot; instructions. Each of the instructions is a tuple (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) where &quot;i&quot; is the index of variable to check (1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;), and &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are functions from {1, 2, ..., &quot;k&quot;} to {1, 2, ..., &quot;k&quot;}. Numbers 1, 2, ..., &quot;k&quot; are called states of the branching program. The program initially starts in state 1, and each instruction (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) changes the state from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) or &quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), depending on whether the &quot;i&quot;th variable is 0 or 1. The function mapping an input to a final state of the program is called the &quot;yield&quot; of the program (more precisely, the yield on an input is the function mapping any initial state to the corresponding final state). The program &quot;accepts&quot; a set formula_13 of variable values when there is some set of functions formula_14 such that a variable sequence formula_15 is in &quot;A&quot; precisely when its yield is in &quot;F&quot;. 

A family of branching programs consists of a branching program with &quot;n&quot; variables for each &quot;n&quot;. It accepts a language when the &quot;n&quot; variable program accepts the language restricted to length &quot;n&quot; inputs.

It is easy to show that every language &quot;L&quot; on {0,1} can be recognized by a family of branching programs of width 5 and exponential length, or by a family of exponential width and linear length.

Every regular language on {0,1} can be recognized by a family of branching programs of constant width and linear number of instructions (since a DFA can be converted to a branching program). BWBP denotes the class of languages recognizable by a family of branching programs of bounded width and polynomial length.

Barrington&#x27;s theorem says that BWBP is exactly nonuniform NC1. The proof uses the nonsolvability of the symmetric group S5.

The theorem is rather surprising. For instance, it implies that the majority function can be computed by a family of branching programs of constant width and polynomial size, while intuition might suggest that to achieve polynomial size, one needs a linear number of states.

===Proof of Barrington&#x27;s theorem===
A branching program of constant width and polynomial size can be easily converted (via divide-and-conquer) to a circuit in NC1.

Conversely, suppose a circuit in NC1 is given. Without loss of generality, assume it uses only AND and NOT gates.

Call a branching program α-computing a circuit &quot;C&quot; if it works as identity when &#x27;s output is 0, and as when &#x27;s output is 1.

As a consequence of Lemma 1 and the fact that all cycles of length 5 are conjugate, for any two 5-cycles , , if there exists a branching program α-computing a circuit &quot;C&quot;, then there exists a branching program β-computing the circuit &quot;C&quot;, of the same length.

The size of the branching program is at most 4, where &quot;d&quot; is the depth of the circuit. If the circuit has logarithmic depth, the branching program has polynomial length.

<doc id="22076" wikidata="Q201565" url="?curid=22076" title="Nori">
<text>Nori is a dried edible seaweed used in Japanese cuisine, usually made from species of the red algae genus &quot;Pyropia&quot;, including &quot;P. yezoensis&quot; and &quot;P. tenera&quot;. It has a strong and distinctive flavor, and is generally made into flat sheets and used to wrap rolls of sushi or &quot;onigiri&quot; (rice balls).

The finished dried sheets are made by a shredding and rack-drying process that resembles papermaking. They are sold in packs in grocery stores for culinary purposes. Since nori sheets easily absorb water from the air and degrade, a desiccant is needed when storing nori for any significant time.

Nori—despite not being cultivated by humans until the 1600s—has been popular since the pre-modern era in Japan, having been used as currency, offerings at shrines, and food since the 700s.

== History ==
===Ancient===

Originally, the term &quot;nori&quot; was generic and referred to seaweeds, including &quot;hijiki&quot;. One of the earliest descriptions of nori is dated to around the eighth century. In the Taihō Code of 701 CE, &quot;nori&quot; was already included in the form of taxation. Local people were described as drying nori in the &quot;Hitachi Province Fudoki&quot; (721–721 CE), and harvesting of nori was mentioned in the &quot;Izumo Province Fudoki&quot; (713–733 CE). In the &quot;Utsubo Monogatari&quot;, written around 987 CE, &quot;nori&quot; was recognized as a common food.

===Modern===
Nori had been consumed as paste form until the sheet form (&quot;ita-nori&quot; 板海苔) was invented in Asakusa, Tokyo, around 1750 in the Edo period through the method of Japanese paper-making.

The word &quot;&quot;nori&quot; first appeared in an English-language publication in &quot;C. P. Thunberg&#x27;s Trav.&quot;, published in 1796. It was used in conjugation as &quot;Awa nori&quot;, probably referring to what now is called &quot;aonori&quot;&quot;, i.e., green laver.

When Japan was in need of high food production after World War II, production of nori was in decline. They sought to cultivate nori in addition to traditional wild harvesting from the sea. Due to a lack of understanding of nori&#x27;s three-stage life cycle, however, those attempting to produce nori artificially did not understand why their cultivation methods were not being productive with nori. The industry was rescued by knowledge derived from the work of British phycologist Kathleen Mary Drew-Baker, who had been researching the organism &quot;Porphyria umbilicalis&quot; that grew in the seas around Wales and was harvested for food (laverbread), as in Japan. Her work was discovered by Japanese scientists who applied it to artificial methods of seeding and growing the nori, rescuing the industry. Kathleen Baker was hailed in Japan as the &quot;Mother of the Sea&quot; and a statue was erected in her memory. She is still revered as the savior of the Japanese nori industry.

The word &quot;nori&quot; started to be used widely in the United States and the product (imported in dry form from Japan) became widely available at natural food stores and Asian-American grocery stores in the 1960s due to the macrobiotic movement and in the 1970s with the increase of sushi bars and Japanese restaurants.

In the 21st century, the Japanese nori industry faces a new decline due to increased competition from seaweed producers in China and Korea, and an increase in domestic sales tax.

== Production ==

Production and processing of &quot;nori&quot; is an advanced form of agriculture. The biology of &quot;Pyropia&quot;, although complicated, now is well understood, and this knowledge is used to control the production process. Farming takes place in the sea where the &quot;Pyropia&quot; plants grow attached to nets suspended at the sea surface and where the farmers operate from boats. The plants grow rapidly, requiring approximately 45 days from &quot;seeding&quot; until the first harvest. Multiple harvests can be taken from a single seeding, typically at approximately ten-day intervals. Harvesting is accomplished using mechanical harvesters of a variety of configurations. Processing of raw product is mostly accomplished by highly automated machines that accurately duplicate traditional manual processing steps, but with much improved efficiency and consistency. The final product is a paper-thin, black, dried sheet of approximately and in weight.

Several grades of nori are available in the United States. The most common (and least expensive) grades are imported from China, costing approximately six cents per sheet. At the high end, ranging up to 90 cents per sheet, are &quot;delicate &quot;shin-nori&quot;&quot; (&quot;nori&quot; from the first of the year&#x27;s several harvests) cultivated in the Ariake Sea, off the island of Kyushu in Japan.

In Japan, more than of coastal waters are given to producing of nori, worth more than a billion dollars. China produces approximately a third of this amount.

Wild seaweed is still gathered to make nori, often found growing on rocks at the beach. Such wild nori is called &quot;iwanori&quot; (&quot;rock nori&quot;), and are known for their rougher texture and taste.

== Culinary uses ==
Nori is commonly used as a wrap for sushi and &quot;onigiri&quot; (rice balls). The dry seaweed is used to pick up rice balls without getting the hands sticky. &quot;Senbei&quot; (rice crackers) sometimes contain a piece of nori as well.

Strips or small sheets of nori are used as garnish for noodles, soups, and rice dishes. Flakes of nori are used in &quot;furikake&quot; seasonings, to be sprinkled over rice or added to &quot;onigiri&quot;. Very small flakes or powdered nori can be dusted over a variety of savory foods. 

Typically, nori is toasted prior to consumption. Toasted nori is called &quot;yaki-nori&quot;. A common secondary product is toasted and flavored nori (&quot;ajitsuke-nori&quot;), in which a flavoring mixture (variable, but typically soy sauce, sugar, sake, mirin, and seasonings) is applied in combination with the toasting process. Nori is also eaten by making it into a soy sauce-flavored paste, &quot;nori no tsukudani&quot; (). Sometimes it is also used as a form of food decoration, such as creating faces or anime characters in bento boxes.

A related product, prepared from the unrelated green algae &quot;Monostroma&quot; and &quot;Enteromorpha&quot;, is called &quot;aonori&quot; ( literally blue/green &quot;nori&quot;) and it is used as an herb on everyday meals, such as &quot;okonomiyaki&quot; and &quot;yakisoba&quot;.

== Nutrition ==

Raw seaweed is 85% water, 6% protein, 5% carbohydrates, and has negligible fat. In a 100 gram reference amount, seaweed is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin A, vitamin C, riboflavin, and folate. Seaweed is a moderate source (less than 20% DV) of niacin, iron, and zinc. Seaweed has a high content of iodine, providing a substantial amount in just one gram. A 2014 study reported that dried purple laver (&quot;nori&quot;) contains vitamin B12 in sufficient quantities to meet the RDA requirement (Vitamin B12 content: 77.6 μg /100 g dry weight). By contrast, however, a 2017 review concluded that vitamin B12 may be destroyed during metabolism or is converted into inactive B12 analogs during drying and storage. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics stated in 2016 that nori is not an adequate source of vitamin B12 for humans. 

== Health risks ==
Nori may contain toxic metals (arsenic and cadmium), whose levels are highly variable among nori products. It also contains amphipod allergens that may cause serious allergic reactions, especially in highly sensitized crustacean-allergic people.

== Similar food ==
The red algae genera is also consumed in Korean cuisine as &quot;gim&quot;, in Chinese cuisine as &quot;haitai&quot; (海苔) or &quot;zicai&quot; (紫菜), and in Wales and Ireland as laverbread.

<text>Normative ethics is the study of ethical behaviour and is the branch of philosophical ethics that investigates questions regarding how one ought to act, in a moral sense.

Normative ethics is distinct from meta-ethics in that normative ethics examines standards for the rightness and wrongness of actions, whereas meta-ethics studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts. Likewise, normative ethics is distinct from applied ethics in that normative ethics is more concerned with &#x27;who ought one be&#x27; rather than the ethics of a specific issue (e.g. if, or when, abortion is acceptable). Normative ethics is also distinct from descriptive ethics, as descriptive ethics is an empirical investigation of people&#x27;s moral beliefs. In this context normative ethics is sometimes called &quot;prescriptive&quot;, as opposed to &quot;descriptive&quot; ethics. However, on certain versions of the view of moral realism, moral facts are both descriptive and prescriptive at the same time.

Most traditional moral theories rest on principles that determine whether an action is right or wrong. Classical theories in this vein include utilitarianism, Kantianism, and some forms of contractarianism. These theories mainly offered the use of overarching moral principles to resolve difficult moral decisions.

==Normative ethical theories==
There are disagreements about what precisely gives an action, rule, or disposition its ethical force. There are three competing views on how moral questions should be answered, along with hybrid positions that combine some elements of each: virtue ethics, deontological ethics; and consequentialism. Virtue ethics focuses on the character of those who are acting. In contrast, both deontological ethics and consequentialism focus on the status of the action, rule, or disposition itself, and come in various forms.

=== Virtue ethics ===

Virtue ethics, advocated by Aristotle with some aspects being supported by Saint Thomas Aquinas, focuses on the inherent character of a person rather than on specific actions. There has been a significant revival of virtue ethics since the 1950s, through the work of such philosophers as G. E. M. Anscombe, Philippa Foot, Alasdair MacIntyre, and Rosalind Hursthouse.

=== Deontological ethics ===

Deontology argues that decisions should be made considering the factors of one&#x27;s duties and one&#x27;s rights. Some deontological theories include:

* Immanuel Kant&#x27;s categorical imperative, which roots morality in humanity&#x27;s rational capacity and asserts certain inviolable moral laws.
* The contractualism of John Rawls, which holds that the moral acts are those that we would all agree to if we were unbiased, behind a &quot;veil of ignorance.&quot;
* Natural rights theories, such that of John Locke or Robert Nozick, which hold that human beings have absolute, natural rights.

=== Consequentialism ===

Consequentialism argues that the morality of an action is contingent on the action&#x27;s outcome or result. Consequentialist theories, varying in what they consider to be valuable (i.e., axiology), include:

* Utilitarianism holds that an action is right if it leads to the most &quot;happiness&quot; for the greatest number of people. Prior to the coining of the term &quot;consequentialism&quot; by G. E. M. Anscombe in 1958 and the adoption of that term in the literature that followed, &quot;utilitarianism&quot; was the generic term for &quot;consequentialism&quot;, referring to all theories that promoted maximizing &quot;any&quot; form of utility, not just those that promoted maximizing happiness.
* State consequentialism, or Mohist consequentialism, holds that an action is right if it leads to &quot;state welfare&quot;, through &quot;order&quot;, &quot;material wealth&quot;, and &quot;population growth&quot;.
* Situational ethics emphasizes the particular context of an act when evaluating it ethically. Specifically, Christian forms of situational ethics hold that the correct action is the one that creates the most loving result, and that &quot;love&quot; should always be people&#x27;s goal.
* Intellectualism dictates that the best action is the one that best fosters and promotes &quot;knowledge&quot;.
* Welfarism, which argues that the best action is the one that most increases &quot;economic well-being or welfare&quot;.
* Preference utilitarianism, which holds that the best action is the one that leads to the most overall &quot;preference satisfaction&quot;.

=== Other theories ===

*Social contract theories are a wide range of postulates concerning the voluntary and consensual pacts between two or more individuals or collectives, whose actions related to the following of the clauses of said contract posited while it was in force should be respected and obeyed.
*Ethics of care, or relational ethics, founded by feminist theorists, notably Carol Gilligan, argues that morality arises out of the experiences of empathy and compassion. It emphasizes the importance of interdependence and relationships in achieving ethical goals.
*Pragmatic ethics is difficult to classify fully within any of the four preceding conceptions. This view argues that moral correctness evolves similarly to other kinds of knowledge—socially over the course of many lifetimes—and that norms, principles, and moral criteria are likely to be improved as a result of inquiry. Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey are known as the founders of pragmatism; a more recent proponent of pragmatic ethics was James D. Wallace.
*Role ethics is based on the concept of family roles.

==Morality as a binding force==
It can be unclear what it means to say that a person &quot;ought to do X because it is moral, whether they like it or not.&quot; Morality is sometimes presumed to have some kind of special binding force on behaviour, though some philosophers believe that, used this way, the word &quot;ought&quot; seems to wrongly attribute magic powers to morality. For instance, G. E. M. Anscombe worries that &quot;ought&quot; has become &quot;a word of mere mesmeric force.&quot; 
 The British ethicist Philippa Foot elaborates that morality does not seem to have any special binding force, and she clarifies that people only behave morally when motivated by other factors. Foot says &quot;People talk, for instance, about the &#x27;binding force&#x27; of morality, but it is not clear what this means if not that we feel ourselves unable to escape.&quot; The idea is that, faced with an opportunity to steal a book because we can get away with it, moral obligation itself has no power to stop us unless we &quot;feel&quot; an obligation. Morality may therefore have no binding force beyond regular human motivations, and people must be motivated to behave morally. The question then arises: what role does reason play in motivating moral behaviour?

===Motivating morality===
The categorical imperative perspective suggests that proper reason always leads to particular moral behaviour. As mentioned above, Foot instead believes that humans are actually motivated by desires. Proper reason, on this view, allows humans to discover actions that get them what they want (i.e., hypothetical imperatives)—not necessarily actions that are moral.

Social structure and motivation can make morality binding in a sense, but only because it makes moral norms feel inescapable, according to Foot.

John Stuart Mill adds that external pressures, to please others for instance, also influence this felt binding force, which he calls human &quot;conscience&quot;. Mill says that humans must first reason about what is moral, then try to bring the feelings of our conscience in line with our reason. At the same time, Mill says that a good moral system (in his case, utilitarianism) ultimately appeals to aspects of human nature—which, must themselves be nurtured during upbringing. Mill explains:
This firm foundation is that of the social feelings of mankind; the desire to be in unity with our fellow creatures, which is already a powerful principle in human nature, and happily one of those which tend to become stronger, even without express inculcation, from the influences of advancing civilisation.
Mill thus believes that it is important to appreciate that it is feelings that drive moral behavior, but also that they may not be present in some people (e.g. psychopaths). Mill goes on to describe factors that help ensure people develop a conscience and behave morally.

Popular texts such as Joseph Daleiden&#x27;s &quot;The Science of Morality: The Individual, Community, and Future Generations&quot; (1998) describe how societies can use science to figure out how to make people more likely to be good.

<text>Negotiation is a dialogue between two or more parties to resolve points of difference, gain an advantage for an individual or collective, or craft outcomes to satisfy various interests. The parties aspire to agree on matters of mutual interest. The agreement can be beneficial for all or some of the parties involved. The negotiators should establish their own needs and wants while also seeking to understand the wants and needs of others involved to increase their chances of closing deals, avoiding conflicts, forming relationships with other parties, or maximizing mutual gains. Distributive negotiations, or compromises, are conducted by putting forward a position and making concessions to achieve an agreement. The degree to which the negotiating parties trust each other to implement the negotiated solution is a major factor in determining the success of a negotiation.

People negotiate daily, often without considering it a negotiation. Negotiations may occur in organizations, including businesses, non-profits, and governments, as well as in sales and legal proceedings, and personal situations such as marriage, divorce, parenting, friendship, etc. Professional negotiators are often specialized. Examples of professional negotiators include union negotiators, leverage buyout negotiators, peace negotiators, and hostage negotiators. They may also work under other titles, such as diplomats, legislators, or arbitrators. Negotiations may also be conducted by algorithms or machines in what is known as automated negotiation. In automated negotiation, the participants and process have to be modeled correctly. Recent negotiation embraces complexity.
== Types ==

Negotiation can take a variety of forms in different contexts. These may include conferences between members of the United Nations to establish international norms, meetings between combatants to end a military conflict, meetings between representatives of businesses to bring about a transaction, and conversations between parents about how to manage childcare. Mediation is a form of negotiation where a third party helps the conflicting parties negotiate, usually when they are unable to do so by themselves. Mediated negotiation can be contrasted with arbitration, where conflicting parties commit to accepting the decision of a third party. Negotiations in the workplace can impact the entire organization&#x27;s performance.

Negotiation theorists generally distinguish between two primary types of negotiation: distributive negotiation and integrative negotiation. The type of negotiation that takes place is dependent on the mindset of the negotiators and the situation of the negotiation. For example, one-off encounters where lasting relationships do not occur are more likely to produce distributive negotiations whereas lasting relationships are more likely to require integrative negotiating. Theorists vary in their labeling and definition of these two fundamental types.

=== Distributive negotiation ===
Distributive negotiation, compromise, positional negotiation, or hard-bargaining negotiation attempts to distribute a &quot;fixed pie&quot; of benefits. Distributive negotiation operates under zero-sum conditions, where it is assumed that any gain made by one party will be at the expense of the other. Haggling over prices on an open market, as in the purchase of a car or home, is an example of distributive negotiation.

In a distributive negotiation, each side often adopts an extreme or fixed position that they know will not be accepted, and then seeks to cede as little as possible before reaching a deal. Distributive bargainers conceive of negotiation as a process of distributing a fixed amount of value. A distributive negotiation often involves people who have never had a previous interactive relationship with each other and are unlikely to do so again shortly, although all negotiations usually have some distributive element. Since prospect theory indicates that people tend to prioritize the minimization of losses over the maximization of gains, this form of negotiation is likely to be more acrimonious and less productive in agreement.

=== Integrative negotiation ===
Integrative negotiation is also called interest-based, merit-based, win-win, or principled negotiation. It is a set of techniques that attempts to improve the quality and likelihood of negotiated agreement by taking advantage of the fact that different parties often value various outcomes differently. While distributive negotiation assumes there is a fixed amount of value (a &quot;fixed pie&quot;) to be divided between the parties, integrative negotiation attempts to create value in the course of the negotiation (&quot;expand the pie&quot;) by either &quot;compensating&quot; the loss of one item with gains from another (&quot;trade-offs&quot; or logrolling), or by constructing or reframing the issues of the conflict in such a way that both parties benefit (&quot;win-win&quot; negotiation).

However, even integrative negotiation is likely to have some distributive elements, especially when the different parties value some items to the same degree or when details are left to be allocated at the end of the negotiation. While concession by at least one party is always necessary for negotiations, research shows that people who concede more quickly are less likely to explore all integrative and mutually beneficial solutions. Therefore, early concession reduces the chance of an integrative negotiation.

Integrative negotiation often involves a higher degree of trust and the formation of a relationship, although INSEAD professor Horacio Falcao has stated that, counter-intuitively, trust is a helpful aid to successful win-win negotiation but not a necessary requirement: he argues that promotion of interdependence is a more effective strategy that development of trust. Integrative negotiation can also involve creative problem-solving in the pursuit of mutual gains. It sees a good agreement as one that provides optimal gain for both parties, rather than maximum individual gain. Each party seeks to allow the other party sufficient benefit that both will hold to the agreement.

Productive negotiation focuses on the underlying interests of both parties rather than their starting positions and approaches negotiation as a shared problem-solving exercise rather than an individualized battle. Adherence to objective and principled criteria is the basis for productive negotiation and agreement.

===Text-based negotiation===
Text-based negotiation refers to the process of working up the text of an agreement that all parties are willing to accept and sign. Negotiating parties may begin with a draft text, consider new textual suggestions, and work to find the middle ground among various differing positions.

Common examples of text-based negotiation include the redaction of a constitution, law or sentence by a constitutional assembly, legislature or court respectively. Other more specific examples are United Nations&#x27; negotiation regarding the reform of the UN Security Council and the formation of the international agreement underpinning the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in the Asia-Pacific Region, where the parties involved failed in 2019 to agree on a text which would suit India.

Such negotiations are often founded on the principle that &quot;nothing is agreed until everything is agreed&quot;. For example, this principle, also known as the single undertaking approach, is often used in World Trade Organization negotiations, although some negotiations relax this requirement. The principle formed part of the British negotiating approach for the Brexit deal following the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union.

=== Integrated negotiation ===
&quot;Integrated negotiation&quot; is a strategic attempt to maximize value in any single negotiation through the astute linking and sequencing of other negotiations and decisions related to one&#x27;s operating activities.

This approach in complex settings is executed by mapping out all potentially relevant negotiations, conflicts, and operating decisions to integrate helpful connections among them while minimizing any potentially harmful connections (see examples below).

&quot;Integrated negotiation&quot; is not to be confused with &quot;integrative negotiation&quot;, a different concept (as outlined above) related to a non-zero-sum approach to creating value in negotiations.

Integrated negotiation was first identified and labeled by the international negotiator and author Peter Johnston in his book &quot;Negotiating with Giants&quot;.

One of the examples cited in Johnston&#x27;s book is that of J. D. Rockefeller deciding where to build his first major oil refinery. Instead of taking the easier, cheaper route from the oil fields to refine his petroleum in Pittsburgh, Rockefeller chose to build his refinery in Cleveland, because he recognized that he would have to negotiate with the rail companies transporting his refined oil to market. Pittsburgh had just one major railroad, which would therefore be able to dictate prices in negotiations, while Cleveland had three railroads that Rockefeller knew would compete for his business, potentially reducing his costs significantly. The leverage gained in these rail negotiations more than offset the additional operating costs of sending his oil to Cleveland for refining, helping establish Rockefeller&#x27;s empire, while undermining his competitors who failed to integrate their core operating decisions with their negotiation strategies.

Other examples of integrated negotiation include the following:
* In sports, athletes in the final year of their contracts will ideally hit peak performance so they can negotiate robust, long-term contracts in their favor.
* A union needs to negotiate and resolve any significant internal conflicts to maximize its collective clout before going to the table to negotiate a new contract with management.
* If purchases for similar goods or services are occurring independently of one another across different government departments, recognizing this and consolidating orders into one large volume purchase can help create buying leverage and cost savings in negotiations with suppliers.
* A tech start-up looking to negotiate being bought out by a larger industry player in the future can improve its odds of that happening by ensuring, wherever possible, that its systems, technology, competencies, and culture are as compatible as possible with those of its most likely buyer.
* A politician negotiating support for a presidential run may want to avoid bringing on board any high-profile supporters who risk alienating other important potential supporters while avoiding any unexpected new policies that could also limit the size of their growing coalition.

=== Bad faith ===

When a party pretends to negotiate but secretly has no intention of compromising, the party is negotiating in bad faith; for example, when a political party sees political benefit in &quot;appearing&quot; to negotiate without having any intention of making the compromises necessary to settle.

Bad faith negotiations are often used in political science and political psychology to refer to negotiating strategies in which there is no real intention to reach compromise or a model of information processing. The &quot;inherent bad faith model&quot; of information processing is a theory in political psychology that was first put forth by Ole Holsti to explain the relationship between John Foster Dulles&#x27; beliefs and his model of information processing. It is the most widely studied model of one&#x27;s opponent: A state is presumed implacably hostile, and contra-indicators of this are ignored. They are dismissed as propaganda ploys or signs of weakness. Examples are John Foster Dulles&#x27; position regarding the Soviet Union.

== Negotiation pie ==
The total of advantages and disadvantages to be distributed in a negotiation is illustrated with the term negotiation pie. The course of the negotiation can either lead to an increase, shrinking, or stagnation of these values. If the negotiating parties can expand the total pie, a win-win situation is possible, assuming that both parties profit from the expansion of the pie. In practice, however, this maximization approach is oftentimes impeded by the so-called small pie bias, i.e. the psychological underestimation of the negotiation pie&#x27;s size. Likewise, the possibility to increase the pie may be underestimated due to the so-called incompatibility bias. Contrary to enlarging the pie, the pie may also shrink during negotiations e.g. due to (excessive) negotiation costs.

== International negotiation ==
Due to different cultural lenses negotiation style differ worldwide. These differences comprise among others how the parties exchange information, the use of different strategies, conceptions of the nature of negotiation, the use of power, the use of options. Negotiations as they are often taught and used by practicionners in &quot;Western&quot; countries may not be effective or may even be counterproductive in &quot;non-Western&quot; countries – such as Asian countries.

== Strategies ==
There are many different ways to categorize the essential elements of negotiation.

One view of negotiation involves three basic elements: &quot;process&quot;, &quot;behavior,&quot; and &quot;substance&quot;. The process refers to how the parties negotiate: the context of the negotiations, the parties to the negotiations, the tactics used by the parties, and the sequence and stages in which all of these play out. Behavior refers to the relationships among these parties, the communication between them, and the styles they adopt. The substance refers to what the parties negotiate over: the agenda, the issues (positions and – more helpfully – interests), the options, and the agreement(s) reached at the end.

Another view of negotiation comprises four elements: &quot;strategy&quot;, &quot;process&quot;, &quot;tools&quot;, and &quot;tactics&quot;. The Strategy comprises top-level goals. Which typically include the relationship and the outcome. Processes and tools include the steps to follow and roles to take in preparing for and negotiating with the other parties. Tactics include more detailed statements and actions and responses to others&#x27; statements and actions. Some add to this &quot;persuasion and influence&quot;, asserting that these have become integral to modern-day negotiation success, and so should not be omitted.

Strategic approaches to concession-making include consideration of the optimum time to make a concession, making concessions in installments, not all at once, and ensuring that the opponent is aware that a concession has been made, rather than a re-expression of a position already outlined, and aware of the cost incurred in making the concession, especially where the other party is generally less aware of the nature of the business or the product being negotiated.

=== Stages in the negotiation process ===
Negotiators do not need to sacrifice effective negotiation in favor of a positive relationship between parties. Rather than conceding, each side can appreciate that the other has emotions and motivations of their own and use this to their advantage in discussing the issue. Understanding perspectives can help move parties toward a more integrative solution. Fisher &quot;et al.&quot; illustrate a few techniques that effectively improve perspective-taking in the book &quot;Getting to Yes&quot;, and through the following, negotiators can separate people from the problem itself:

* Put yourself in their shoes – People tend to search for information that confirms their own beliefs and often ignore information that contradicts prior beliefs. To negotiate effectively, it is important to empathize with the other party&#x27;s point of view. One should be open to other views and attempt to approach an issue from the perspective of the other.
* Discuss each other&#x27;s perceptions – A more direct approach to understanding the other party is to explicitly discuss each other&#x27;s perceptions. Each individual should openly and honestly share their perceptions without assigning blame or judgment to the other.
* Find opportunities to act inconsistently with their views – The other party may have prior perceptions and expectations about the other side. The other side can act in a way that directly contradicts those preconceptions, effectively conveying that the party is interested in an integrative negotiation.
* Face-saving – This approach justifies a stance based on one&#x27;s previously expressed principles and values in a negotiation. This approach to an issue is less arbitrary, and thus, it is more understandable from the opposing party&#x27;s perspective.

Additionally, negotiators can use specific communication techniques to build stronger relationships and develop more meaningful negotiation solutions.

* Active listening – Listening is more than just hearing what the other side says. Active listening involves paying close attention to what is being said verbally and nonverbally. It involves periodically seeking further clarification from the person. By asking the person exactly what they mean, they may realize the negotiator takes them seriously and is not simply walking through a routine. The Australian Mosaic Project Services business commends &quot;proactive&quot; rather than just &quot;active&quot; listening, in which more emphasis is placed on the asking of questions as well as listening actively to the answers given.
* Speak for a purpose – Too much information can be as harmful as too little. Before discussing an important point, determine exactly what to communicate to the other party. Determine the exact purpose that this shared information will serve.

=== Employing an advocate ===
A skilled negotiator may serve as an advocate for one party to the negotiation. The advocate attempts to obtain the most favorable outcomes possible for that party. In this process, the negotiator attempts to determine the minimum outcome(s) the other party is (or parties are) willing to accept, then adjusts their demands accordingly. A &quot;successful&quot; negotiation in the advocacy approach is when the negotiator can obtain all or most of the outcomes their party desires, but without driving the other party to permanently break off negotiations.

Skilled negotiators may use a variety of tactics ranging from negotiation hypnosis to a straightforward presentation of demands or setting of preconditions, to more deceptive approaches such as cherry picking. Intimidation and salami tactics may also play a part in swaying the outcome of negotiations.

Another negotiation tactic is the bad guy/good guy. Bad guy/good guy is when one negotiator acts as a bad guy by using anger and threats. The other negotiator acts as a good guy by being considerate and understanding. The good guy blames the bad guy for all the difficulties while soliciting concessions and agreement from the opponent.

=== BATNA ===
The best alternative to a negotiated agreement, or BATNA, is the most advantageous alternative course of action a negotiator can take should the current negotiation end without reaching an agreement. The quality of a BATNA has the potential to improve a party&#x27;s negotiation outcome. Understanding one&#x27;s BATNA can empower an individual and allow him or her to set higher goals when moving forward. Alternatives need to be actual and actionable to be of value. Negotiators may also consider the other party&#x27;s BATNA and how it compares to what they are offering during the negotiation.

=== Conflict styles ===
Kenneth W. Thomas identified five styles or responses to negotiation. These five strategies have been frequently described in the literature and are based on the dual-concern model. The dual-concern model of conflict resolution is a perspective that assumes individuals&#x27; preferred method of dealing with conflict is based on two themes or dimensions:

# A concern for self (i.e., assertiveness), and
# A concern for others (i.e., empathy).

Based on this model, individuals balance their concern for personal needs and interests with the needs and interests of others. The following five styles can be used based on individuals&#x27; preferences, depending on their pro-self or pro-social goals. These styles can change over time, and individuals can have strong dispositions toward numerous styles.




=== Types of negotiators ===
Three basic kinds of negotiators have been identified by researchers involved in The Harvard Negotiation Project. These types of negotiators are soft bargainers, hard bargainers, and principled bargainers.

; Soft: These people see negotiation as too close to competition, so they choose a gentle style of bargaining. The offers they make are not in their best interests, they yield to others&#x27; demands, avoid confrontation, and they maintain good relations with fellow negotiators. Their perception of others is one of friendship, and their goal is agreement. They do not separate the people from the problem but are soft on both. They avoid contests of wills and insist on the agreement, offering solutions and easily trusting others and changing their opinions.
; Hard: These people use contentious strategies to influence, utilizing phrases such as &quot;this is my final offer&quot; and &quot;take it or leave it&quot;. They make threats, are distrustful of others, insist on their position, and apply pressure to negotiate. They see others as adversaries and their ultimate goal is victory. Additionally, they search for one single answer and insist you agree with it. They do not separate the people from the problem (as with soft bargainers), but they are hard on both the people involved and the problem.
; Principled: Individuals who bargain this way seek integrative solutions and do so by sidestepping commitment to specific positions. They focus on the problem rather than the intentions, motives, and needs of the people involved. They separate the people from the problem, explore interests, avoid bottom lines, and reach results based on standards independent of personal will. They base their choices on objective criteria rather than power, pressure, self-interest, or an arbitrary decisional procedure. These criteria may be drawn from moral standards, principles of fairness, professional standards, and tradition.

Researchers from The Harvard Negotiation Project recommend that negotiators explore several tactics to reach the best solution for their problems, but this is often not the case (as when you may be dealing with an individual using soft or hard-bargaining tactics) (Forsyth, 2010).
Tactics are always an important part of the negotiating process. More often than not they are subtle, difficult to identify, and used for multiple purposes. Tactics are more frequently used in distributive negotiations and when the focus is on taking as much value off the table as possible. Many negotiation tactics exist. Below are a few commonly used tactics.
* Auction: The bidding process is designed to create competition. When multiple parties want the same thing, pit them against one another. When people know that they may lose out on something, they want it even more. Not only do they want the thing that is being bid on, but they also want to win, just to win. Taking advantage of someone&#x27;s competitive nature can drive up the price.
*Brinkmanship: One party aggressively pursues a set of terms to the point where the other negotiating party must either agree or walk away. Brinkmanship is a type of &quot;hard nut&quot; approach to bargaining in which one party pushes the other party to the &quot;brink&quot; or edge of what that party is willing to accommodate. Successful brinkmanship convinces the other party they have no choice but to accept the offer and there is no acceptable alternative to the proposed agreement.
*Bogey: Negotiators use the bogey tactic to pretend that an issue of little or no importance is very important. Then, later in the negotiation, the issue can be traded for a major concession of actual importance.
*Calling a higher authority: To mitigate too far-reaching concessions, deescalate, or overcome a deadlock situation, one party makes the further negotiation process dependent on the decision of a decision maker, not present at the negotiation table.
*Chicken: Negotiators propose extreme measures often in the form of bluffs to force the other party to chicken out and give them what they want. This tactic can be dangerous when parties are unwilling to back down and go through with the extreme measure.
*Concession: One party offers up something with hope reaching or coming closer to an agreement. 
*Defense in Depth: Several layers of decision-making authority is used to allow further concessions each time the agreement goes through a different level of authority. In other words, each time the offer goes to a decision-maker, that decision maker asks to add another concession to close the deal.
*Deadlines: Give the other party a deadline, forcing them to make a decision. This method uses time to apply pressure on the other party. Deadlines given can be actual or artificial.
*Flinch: Flinching is showing a strong negative physical reaction to a proposal. Common examples of flinching are gasping for air or a visible expression of surprise or shock. The flinch can be done consciously or unconsciously. The flinch signals to the opposite party that you think the offer or proposal is absurd in hopes the other party will lower their aspirations. Seeing a physical reaction is more believable than hearing someone saying, &quot;I&#x27;m shocked&quot;.
*Good Guy/Bad Guy: Within the tactic of good guy/bad guy (synonyms are good cop/bad cop or black hat/white hat) oftentimes positive and unpleasant tasks are divided between two negotiators on the same negotiation side or unpleasant tasks or decisions are allocated to a (real or fictitious) outsider. The good guy supports the conclusion of the contract and emphasizes positive aspects of the negotiation (mutual interests). The bad guy criticizes negative aspects (opposing interests). The division of the two roles allows for more consistent behavior and credibility of the individual negotiators. As the good guy promotes the contract, he/she can build trust with the other side.
*Holding out for concession: Negotiators can choose avoiding giving concessions and hold out in the hope that the other side will concede before they do. This tough bargaining position can maximize the negotiators ex-post (actual) outcome.
*Highball/Low-ball or Ambit claim: Depending on whether selling or buying, sellers or buyers use a ridiculously high, or ridiculously low opening offer that is not achievable. The theory is that the extreme offer makes the other party reevaluate their opening offer and move close to the resistance point (as far as you are willing to go to reach an agreement). Another advantage is that the party giving the extreme demand appears more flexible when they make concessions toward a more reasonable outcome. A danger of this tactic is that the opposite party may think negotiating is a waste of time.
*The Nibble: Also known under the salami tactic or quivering quill, nibbling is the demand for proportionally small concessions that have not been discussed previously just before closing the deal. This method takes advantage of the other party&#x27;s desire to close by adding &quot;just one more thing&quot;.
*Snow Job: Negotiators overwhelm the other party with so much information that they have difficulty determining what information is important, and what is a diversion. Negotiators may also use technical language or jargon to mask a simple answer to a question asked by a non-expert.
*Mirroring: When people get on well, the outcome of a negotiation is likely to be more positive. To create trust and rapport, a negotiator may mimic or mirror the opponent&#x27;s behavior and repeat what they say. Mirroring refers to a person repeating the core content of what another person just said, or repeating a certain expression. It indicates attention to the subject of negotiation and acknowledges the other party&#x27;s point or statement. Mirroring can help create trust and establish a relationship.
*Anchoring: Anchoring is the process of establishing a reference point first to guide the other person closer to your suggested price. It is often presented at the beginning of a negotiation to influence the rest of the negotiation. As an example, say you want to sell a car for 50,000 dollars. Now a customer walks in saying they want to buy a car. You say that you can sell the car for 65,000 dollars. Their counteroffer would probably be 50,000–55,000 dollars. This also works and vice versa for buying something. The idea here is that we are narrowing the other parties&#x27; expectations down or up. To counter-anchoring, you should point out the fact that they are anchoring and say that they need to drive it down to an acceptable price.

=== Nonverbal communication ===
Communication is a key element of negotiation. Effective negotiation requires that participants effectively convey and interpret information. Participants in a negotiation communicate information not only verbally but non-verbally through body language and gestures. By understanding how nonverbal communication works, a negotiator is better equipped to interpret the information other participants are leaking non-verbally while keeping secret those things that would inhibit his/her ability to negotiate.

==== Examples ====
=====Non-verbal &quot;anchoring&quot;=====

In a negotiation, a person can gain the advantage by verbally expressing a position first. By anchoring one&#x27;s position, one establishes the position from which the negotiation proceeds. Similarly, one can &quot;anchor&quot; and gain an advantage with nonverbal (body language) cues.

* Personal space: The person at the head of the table is the apparent symbol of power. Negotiators can negate this strategic advantage by positioning allies in the room to surround that individual.
* First impression: Begin the negotiation with positive gestures and enthusiasm. Look the person in the eye with sincerity. If you cannot maintain eye contact, the other person might think you are hiding something or that you are insincere. Give a solid handshake.

=====Reading non-verbal communication=====

Being able to read the non-verbal communication of another person can significantly aid in the communication process. By being aware of inconsistencies between a person&#x27;s verbal and non-verbal communication and reconciling them, negotiators can come to better resolutions. Examples of incongruity in body language include:
* Nervous Laugh: A laugh not matching the situation. This could be a sign of nervousness or discomfort. When this happens, it may be good to probe with questions to discover the person&#x27;s true feelings.
* Positive words but negative body language: If someone asks their negotiation partner if they are annoyed and the person pounds their fist and responds sharply, &quot;what makes you think anything is bothering me?&quot;
* Hands raised in a clenched position: The person raising his/her hands in this position reveals frustration even when he/she is smiling. This is a signal that the person doing it may be holding back a negative attitude.
* If possible, it may be helpful for negotiation partners to spend time together in a comfortable setting outside of the negotiation room. Knowing how each partner non-verbally communicates outside of the negotiation setting helps negotiation partners sense the incongruity between verbal and non-verbal communication.

=====Conveying receptivity=====

The way negotiation partners position their bodies relative to each other may influence how receptive each is to the other person&#x27;s message and ideas.
* Face and eyes: Receptive negotiators smile, and make plenty of eye contact. This conveys the idea that there is more interest in the person than in what is being said. On the other hand, non-receptive negotiators make little to no eye contact. Their eyes may be squinted, jaw muscles clenched and head turned slightly away from the speaker
* Arms and hands: To show receptivity, negotiators should spread their arms and open a hands-on table or relax on their lap. Negotiators show poor receptivity when their hands are clenched, crossed, positioned in front of their mouth, or rubbing the back of their neck.
* Legs and Feet: Receptive negotiators sit with legs together or one leg slightly in front of the other. When standing, they distribute weight evenly and place their hands on their hips with their body tilted toward the speaker. Non-receptive negotiators stand with their legs crossed, pointing away from the speaker.
* Torso: Receptive negotiators sit on the edge of their chairs, unbuttoning their suit coats with their bodies tilted toward the speaker. Non-receptive negotiators may lean back in their chairs and keep their suit coats buttoned.

Receptive negotiators tend to appear relaxed with their hands open and palms visibly displayed.

=== Barriers ===
* Die-hard bargainers
* Lack of trust
* Informational vacuums and negotiator&#x27;s dilemma
* Structural impediments
* Spoilers
* Cultural and gender differences
* Communication problems
* The power of dialogue

== Emotion ==

Emotions play an important part in the negotiation process, although it is only in recent years that their effect is being studied. Emotions have the potential to play either a positive or negative role in negotiation. During negotiations, the decision as to whether or not to settle rests in part on emotional factors. Negative emotions can cause intense and even irrational behavior and can cause conflicts to escalate and negotiations to break down, but may be instrumental in attaining concessions. On the other hand, positive emotions often facilitate reaching an agreement and help to maximize joint gains, but can also be instrumental in attaining concessions. Positive and negative discrete emotions can be strategically displayed to influence task and relational outcomes and may play out differently across cultural boundaries.

=== Affect effect ===
Dispositions for effects affect various stages of negotiation: which strategies to use, which strategies are chosen, the way the other party and their intentions are perceived, their willingness to reach an agreement, and the final negotiated outcomes. Positive affectivity (PA) and negative affectivity (NA) of one or more of the negotiating sides can lead to very different outcomes.

=== Positive affect ===
Even before the negotiation process starts, people in a positive mood have more confidence, and higher tendencies to plan to use a cooperative strategy. During the negotiation, negotiators who are in a positive mood tend to enjoy the interaction more, show less contentious behavior, use less aggressive tactics, and more cooperative strategies. This, in turn, increases the likelihood that parties will reach their instrumental goals, and enhance the ability to find integrative gains. Indeed, compared with negotiators with negative or natural affectivity, negotiators with positive affectivity reached more agreements and tended to honor those agreements more. Those favorable outcomes are due to better decision-making processes, such as flexible thinking, creative problem-solving, respect for others&#x27; perspectives, willingness to take risks, and higher confidence. The post-negotiation positive effect has beneficial consequences as well. It increases satisfaction with the achieved outcome and influences one&#x27;s desire for future interactions. The PA aroused by reaching an agreement facilitates the dyadic relationship, which brings commitment that sets the stage for subsequent interactions. PA also has its drawbacks: it distorts the perception of self-performance, such that performance is judged to be relatively better than it is. Thus, studies involving self-reports on achieved outcomes might be biased.

=== Negative affect ===
Negative affect has detrimental effects on various stages in the negotiation process. Although various negative emotions affect negotiation outcomes, by far the most researched is anger. Angry negotiators plan to use more competitive strategies and cooperate less, even before the negotiation starts. These competitive strategies are related to reduced joint outcomes.
During negotiations, anger disrupts the process by reducing the level of trust, clouding parties&#x27; judgment, narrowing parties&#x27; focus of attention, and changing their central goal from reaching an agreement to retaliating against the other side. Angry negotiators pay less attention to the opponent&#x27;s interests and are less accurate in judging their interests, thus achieving lower joint gains. Moreover, because anger makes negotiators more self-centered in their preferences, it increases the likelihood that they will reject profitable offers. Opponents who get angry (or cry, or otherwise lose control) are more likely to make errors.
Anger does not help achieve negotiation goals either: it reduces joint gains and does not boost personal gains, as angry negotiators do not succeed. Moreover, negative emotions lead to acceptance of settlements that are not in a positive utility function but rather have a negative utility. However, the expression of negative emotions during negotiation can sometimes be beneficial: legitimately expressed anger can be an effective way to show one&#x27;s commitment, sincerity, and needs. Moreover, although NA reduces gains in integrative tasks, it is a better strategy than PA in distributive tasks (such as zero-sum). In his work on negative affect arousal and white noise, Seidner found support for the existence of a negative affect arousal mechanism through observations regarding the devaluation of speakers from other ethnic origins. Negotiation may be negatively affected, in turn, by submerged hostility toward an ethnic or gender group.

=== Conditions for emotion affect ===
Research indicates that a negotiator&#x27;s emotions do not necessarily affect the negotiation process.
Albarracın et al. (2003) suggested that there are two conditions for emotional affect, both related to the ability (presence of environmental or cognitive disturbances) and the motivation:

# Identification of the effect: requires high motivation, high ability, or both.
# The determination that the effect is relevant and important for the judgment: requires that either the motivation, the ability, or both are low.

According to this model, emotions affect negotiations only when one is high and the other is low. When both ability and motivation are low, the effect is identified, and when both are high the effect is identified but discounted as irrelevant to judgment.
A possible implication of this model is, for example, that the positive effects of PA have on negotiations (as described above) are seen only when either motivation or ability is low.

=== Effect of partner&#x27;s emotions ===
Most studies on emotion in negotiations focus on the effect of the negotiator&#x27;s own emotions on the process. However, what the other party feels might be just as important, as group emotions are known to affect processes both at the group and the personal levels.
When it comes to negotiations, trust in the other party is a necessary condition for its emotion to effect, and visibility enhances the effect.
Emotions contribute to negotiation processes by signaling what one feels and thinks and can thus prevent the other party from engaging in destructive behaviors and indicate what steps should be taken next: PA signals to keep in the same way, while NA points out that mental or behavioral adjustments are needed.
Partner&#x27;s emotions can have two basic effects on the negotiator&#x27;s emotions and behavior: mimetic/ reciprocal or complementary. For example, disappointment or sadness might lead to compassion and more cooperation. In a study by Butt et al. (2005) that simulated real multi-phase negotiation, most people reacted to the partner&#x27;s emotions in a reciprocal, rather than complementary, manner. Specific emotions were found to have different effects on the opponent&#x27;s feelings and are strategies chosen:

* Anger caused the opponents to place lower demands and to concede more in a zero-sum negotiation, but also to evaluate the negotiation less favorably. It provoked both dominating and yielding behaviors of the opponent.
* Pride led to more integrative and compromise strategies by the partner.
* Guilt or regret expressed by the negotiator led to a better impression of him by the opponent, however, it also led the opponent to place higher demands. On the other hand, personal guilt was related to more satisfaction with what one achieved.
* Worry or disappointment left a bad impression on the opponent but led to relatively lower demands by the opponent.

=== Dealing with emotions ===
* Make emotions explicit and validate – Taking a more proactive approach in discussing one&#x27;s emotions can allow for a negotiation to focus on the problem itself, rather than any unexpressed feelings. It is important to allow both parties to share their emotions.
* Allow time to let off steam – It is possible that one party may feel angry or frustrated at some point during the negotiation. Rather than try to avoid discussing those feelings, allow the individual to talk it out. Sitting and listening, without providing too much feedback on the substance itself, can offer enough support for the person to feel better. Once the grievances are released, it may become easier to negotiate.
* Symbolic gestures – Consider that an apology, or any other simple act, may be one of the most effective and low-cost means to reduce any negative emotions between parties.
* Empathy – In every negotiation, emotions will play a major role in determining what is said. It is possible to overreact and misinterpret what the other party says by projecting assumptions. To avoid miscommunication and build a collaborative environment, it is important to shift the focus to the other party and be fully present with them, listening without judgment instead of acting in self-interest and focusing on one&#x27;s own needs and fears. To increase one&#x27;s chances of reaching a deal that works for both parties, one needs to be focused on the other party, their emotions, their interests, and their worries in order to give them what they want. When the other party feels heard and acknowledged, barriers to communication fall, and reaching a consensus is much more likely to happen.

=== Problems with laboratory studies ===
Negotiation is a complex interaction. Capturing all its complexity is a very difficult task, let alone isolating and controlling only certain aspects of it. For this reason, most negotiation studies are done under laboratory conditions and focus only on some aspects. Although such studies have their advantages, they do have major drawbacks when studying emotions:

* Emotions in laboratory studies are usually manipulated and are therefore relatively &#x27;cold&#x27; (not intense). Although those &#x27;cold&#x27; emotions might be enough to show effects, they are qualitatively different from the &#x27;hot&#x27; emotions often experienced during negotiations.
* In real life, people select which negotiations to enter, which affects emotional commitment, motivation, and interests, but this is not the case in lab studies.
* Laboratory studies tend to focus on relatively few well-defined emotions. Real-life scenarios provoke a much wider scale of emotions.
* Coding the emotions has a double catch: if done by a third side, some emotions might not be detected as the negotiator sublimates them for strategic reasons. Self-report measures might overcome this, but they are usually filled only before or after the process, and if filled during the process might interfere with it.

== Group composition ==
=== Multi-party ===
While negotiations involving more than two parties are less often researched, some results from two-party negotiations still apply to more than two parties. One such result is that in negotiations it is common to see language similarity arise between the two negotiating parties. In three-party negotiations, language similarity still arose, and results were particularly efficient when the party with the most to gain from the negotiation adopted language similarities from the other parties.

=== Team ===
Due to globalization and growing business trends, negotiation in the form of teams is becoming widely adopted. Teams can effectively collaborate to break down a complex negotiation. There is more knowledge and wisdom dispersed in a team than in a single mind. Writing, listening, and talking, are specific roles team members must satisfy. The capacity base of a team reduces the number of blunders and increases familiarity in a negotiation.

However, unless a team can appropriately utilize the full capacity of its potential, effectiveness can suffer. One factor in the effectiveness of team negotiation is a problem that occurs through solidarity behavior. Solidarity behavior occurs when one team member reduces his or her utility (benefit) to increase the benefits of other team members. This behavior is likely to occur when interest conflicts rise. When the utility/needs of the negotiation opponent do not align with every team member&#x27;s interests, team members begin to make concessions and balance the benefits gained among the team.

Intuitively, this may feel like a cooperative approach. However, though a team may aim to negotiate in a cooperative or collaborative nature, the outcome may be less successful than is possible, especially when integration is possible. The integrative potential is possible when different negotiation issues are of different importance to each team member. The integrative potential is often missed due to the lack of awareness of each member&#x27;s interests and preferences. Ultimately, this leads to a poorer negotiation result.

Thus, a team can perform more effectively if each member discloses his or her preferences before the negotiation. This step will allow the team to recognize and organize the team&#x27;s joint priorities, which they can take into consideration when engaging with the opposing negotiation party. Because a team is more likely to discuss shared information and common interests, teams must make an active effort to foster and incorporate unique viewpoints from experts from different fields. Research by Daniel Thiemann, which largely focused on computer-supported collaborative tasks, found that the Preference Awareness method is an effective tool for fostering knowledge about joint priorities and further helps the team judge which negotiation issues were of the highest importance.

=== Women ===
Women often excel in collaborative and integrative negotiations, where they can leverage their strong communication skills and empathy to find mutually beneficial solutions. However, they may face challenges in competitive or distributive negotiations, where a more assertive and confrontational approach is typically required. Many of the implications of these findings have strong financial impacts in addition to the social backlash faced by self-advocating women in negotiations, as compared to other advocating women, self-advocating men, and other advocating men. Research in this area has been studied across platforms, in addition to more specific areas like women as physician assistants. The backlash associated with this type of behavior is attributed to the fact that to be self-advocated is considered masculine, whereas the alternative, being accommodating, is considered more feminine. Males, however, do not appear to face any type of backlash for not being self-advocating.

This research has been supported by multiple studies, including one which evaluated candidates participating in a negotiation regarding compensation. This study showed that women who initiated negotiations were evaluated more poorly than men who initiated negotiations. In another variation of this particular setup, men and women evaluated videos of men and women either accepting a compensation package or initiating negotiations. Men evaluated women more poorly for initiating negotiations, while women evaluated both men and women more poorly for initiating negotiations. In this particular experiment, women were less likely to initiate a negotiation with a male, citing nervousness, but there was no variation with the negotiation initiated with another female.

Research also supports the notion that the way individuals respond in a negotiation varies depending on the gender of the opposite party. In all-male groups, the use of deception showed no variation in the level of trust between negotiating parties, however in mixed-sex groups, there was an increase in deceptive tactics when it was perceived that the opposite party was using an accommodating strategy. In all-female groups, there were many shifts in when individuals did and did not employ deception in their negotiation tactics.

=== Academic negotiation ===
The academic world contains a unique management system, wherein faculty members, some of whom have tenure, reside in academic units (e.g. departments), and are overseen by chairs, or heads. These chairs/heads are in turn supervised by deans of the college where their academic unit resides. Negotiation is an area where faculties, chairs/heads, and their deans have little preparation; their doctoral degrees are typically in a highly specialized area according to their academic expertise. However, the academic environment frequently presents situations where negotiation takes place. For example, many faculties are hired with the expectation that they will conduct research and publish scholarly works. For these faculties, where their research requires equipment, space, and/or funding, negotiation of a &quot;start-up&quot; package is critical for their success and future promotion. Also, department chairs often find themselves in situations, typically involving resource redistribution where they must negotiate with their dean, on behalf of their unit. And deans oversee colleges where they must optimize limited resources, such as research space or operating funds while at the same time creating an environment that fosters student success, research accomplishments, and more.

Integrative negotiation is the type predominately found in academic negotiation – where trust and long-term relationships between personnel are valued. Techniques found to be particularly useful in academic settings include: 
#doing your homework – grounding your request in facts
#knowing your value
#listening actively and acknowledging what is being said
#putting yourself in their shoes
#asking – negotiation begins with an ask
#not committing immediately
#managing emotion
*keeping in mind the principle of a &quot;wise agreement&quot;, with its associated emphasis on meeting the interests of both parties to the extent possible as a key working point.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;negotiation&quot; originated in the early 15th century from the Old French &quot;negociacion&quot; from Latin &quot;negotiatio&quot; from &quot;neg&quot;- &quot;no&quot; and &quot;otium&quot; &quot;leisure&quot;. These terms mean &quot;business, trade, traffic&quot;. By the late 1570s negotiation had the definition, &quot;to communicate in search of mutual agreement&quot;. With this new introduction and this meaning, it showed a shift from &quot;doing business&quot; to &quot;bargaining about&quot; business.

<text>Fertility awareness (FA) refers to a set of practices used to determine the fertile and infertile phases of a woman&#x27;s menstrual cycle. Fertility awareness methods may be used to avoid pregnancy, to achieve pregnancy, or as a way to monitor gynecological health.

Methods of identifying infertile days have been known since antiquity, but scientific knowledge gained during the past century has increased the number, variety, and especially accuracy of methods.

Systems of fertility awareness rely on observation of changes in one or more of the primary fertility signs (basal body temperature, cervical mucus, and cervical position), tracking menstrual cycle length and identifying the fertile window based on this information, or both. Other signs may also be observed: these include breast tenderness and mittelschmerz (ovulation pains), urine analysis strips known as ovulation predictor kits (OPKs), and microscopic examination of saliva or cervical fluid. Also available are computerized fertility monitors.

==Terminology==
Symptoms-based methods involve tracking one or more of the three primary fertility signs: basal body temperature, cervical mucus, and cervical position. Systems relying exclusively on cervical mucus include the Billings Ovulation Method, the Creighton Model, and the Two-Day Method. Symptothermal methods combine observations of basal body temperature (BBT), cervical mucus, and sometimes cervical position. Calendar-based methods rely on tracking a woman&#x27;s cycle and identifying her fertile window based on the lengths of her cycles. The best known of these methods is the Standard Days Method. The Calendar-Rhythm method is also considered a calendar-based method, though it is not well defined and has many different meanings to different people.

Systems of fertility awareness may be referred to as fertility awareness–based methods; the term Fertility Awareness Method (FAM) refers specifically to the system taught by Toni Weschler. The term natural family planning is sometimes used to refer to any use of fertility awareness methods, the lactational amenorrhea method and periodic abstinence during fertile times. A method of fertility awareness may be used by natural family planning users to identify these fertile times.

Women who are breastfeeding a child and wish to avoid pregnancy may be able to practice the lactational amenorrhea method. The lactational amenorrhea method is distinct from fertility awareness, but because it also does not involve contraceptives, it is often presented alongside fertility awareness as a method of &quot;natural&quot; birth control.

Within the Catholic Church and some Protestant denominations, the term natural family planning is often used to refer to Fertility Awareness pointing out it is the only method of family planning approved by the Church.

==History==

===Development of calendar-based methods===

It is not known exactly when it was first discovered that women have predictable periods of fertility and infertility. It is already clearly stated in the Talmud tractate Niddah, that a woman only becomes pregnant in specific periods in the month, which seemingly refers to ovulation. St. Augustine wrote about periodic abstinence to avoid pregnancy in the year 388 (the Manichaeans attempted to use this method to remain childfree, and Augustine condemned their use of periodic abstinence). One book states that periodic abstinence was recommended &quot;by a few secular thinkers since the mid-nineteenth century,&quot; but the dominant force in the twentieth century popularization of fertility awareness-based methods was the Roman Catholic Church.

In 1905 Theodoor Hendrik van de Velde, a Dutch gynecologist showed that women only ovulate once per menstrual cycle. In the 1920s, Kyusaku Ogino, a Japanese gynecologist, and Hermann Knaus, from Austria, independently discovered that ovulation occurs about fourteen days before the next menstrual period. Ogino used his discovery to develop a formula for use in aiding infertile women to time intercourse to achieve pregnancy. In 1930, John Smulders, a Roman Catholic physician from the Netherlands, used this discovery to create a method for &quot;avoiding&quot; pregnancy. Smulders published his work with the Dutch Roman Catholic medical association, and this was the first formalized system for periodic abstinence: the rhythm method.

===Introduction of temperature and cervical mucus signs===
In the 1930s, Reverend Wilhelm Hillebrand, a Catholic priest in Germany, developed a system for avoiding pregnancy based on basal body temperature. This temperature method was found to be more effective at helping women avoid pregnancy than were calendar-based methods. Over the next few decades, both systems became widely used among Catholic women. Two speeches delivered by Pope Pius XII in 1951 gave the highest form of recognition to the Catholic Church&#x27;s approval—for couples who needed to avoid pregnancy—of these systems. In the early 1950s, John Billings discovered the relationship between cervical mucus and fertility while working for the Melbourne Catholic Family Welfare Bureau. Billings and several other physicians, including his wife, Dr. Evelyn Billings, studied this sign for a number of years, and by the late 1960s had performed clinical trials and begun to set up teaching centers around the world.

===First symptoms-based teaching organizations===
While Dr. Billings initially taught both the temperature and mucus signs, they encountered problems in teaching the temperature sign to largely illiterate populations in developing countries. In the 1970s they modified the method to rely on only mucus. The international organization founded by Dr. Billings is now known as the World Organization Ovulation Method Billings.

The first organization to teach a symptothermal method was founded in 1971. John and Sheila Kippley, lay Catholics, joined with Dr. Konald Prem in teaching an observational method that relied on all three signs: temperature, mucus, and cervical position. Their organization is now called Couple to Couple League International. The next decade saw the founding of other now-large Catholic organizations, Family of the Americas (1977), teaching the Billings method, and the Pope Paul VI Institute (1985), teaching a new mucus-only system called the Creighton Model.

Up until the 1980s, information about fertility awareness was only available from Catholic sources. The first secular teaching organization was the Fertility Awareness Center in New York, founded in 1981. Toni Weschler started teaching in 1982 and published the bestselling book &quot;Taking Charge of Your Fertility&quot; in 1995. Justisse was founded in 1987 in Edmonton, Canada. These secular organizations all teach symptothermal methods. Although the Catholic organizations are significantly larger than the secular fertility awareness movement, independent secular teachers have become increasingly common since the 1990s.

===Ongoing development===
Development of fertility awareness methods is ongoing. In the late 1990s, the Institute for Reproductive Health at Georgetown University introduced two new methods. The TwoDay Method, a mucus-only system, and CycleBeads and iCycleBeads (the digital version), based on the Standard Days Method, are designed to be both effective and simple to teach, learn, and use. In 2019, Urrutia et al. released a study as well as interactive graph over-viewing all studied fertility awareness based methods. Femtech companies such as Dot and Natural Cycles have also produced new studies and apps to help women avoid pregnancy. Natural Cycles is the first app of its kind to receive FDA approval.

==Fertility signs==
Most menstrual cycles have several days at the beginning that are infertile (pre-ovulatory infertility), a period of fertility, and then several days just before the next menstruation that are infertile (post-ovulatory infertility). The first day of red bleeding is considered day one of the menstrual cycle. Different systems of fertility awareness calculate the fertile period in slightly different ways, using primary fertility signs, cycle history, or both.

==Primary fertility signs==
The three primary signs of fertility are &quot;basal body temperature&quot; (BBT), &quot;cervical mucus&quot;, and &quot;cervical position&quot;. A woman practicing symptoms-based fertility awareness may choose to observe one sign, two signs, or all three. Many women experience secondary fertility signs that correlate with certain phases of the menstrual cycle, such as abdominal pain and heaviness, back pain, breast tenderness, and mittelschmerz (ovulation pains).

===Basal body temperature===
This usually refers to a temperature reading collected when a person first wakes up in the morning (or after their longest sleep period of the day). The true BBT can only be obtained by continuous temperature monitoring through internally worn temperature sensors. In women, ovulation will trigger a rise in BBT between 0.2º and 0.5 °C. (0.5 and 1.°F) that lasts approximately until the next menstruation. This temperature shift may be used to determine the onset of post-ovulatory infertility. (See ref. 30)

===Cervical mucus===
The appearance of cervical mucus and vulvar sensation are generally described together as two ways of observing the same sign. Cervical mucus is produced by the cervix, which connects the uterus to the vaginal canal. Fertile cervical mucus promotes sperm life by decreasing the acidity of the vagina, and also it helps guide sperm through the cervix and into the uterus. The production of fertile cervical mucus is caused by estrogen, the same hormone that prepares a woman&#x27;s body for ovulation. By observing her cervical mucus and paying attention to the sensation as it passes the vulva, a woman can detect when her body is gearing up for ovulation, and also when ovulation has passed. When ovulation occurs, estrogen production drops slightly and progesterone starts to rise. The rise in progesterone causes a distinct change in the quantity and quality of mucus observed at the vulva.

===Cervical position===
The cervix changes position in response to the same hormones that cause cervical mucus to be produced and to dry up. When a woman is in an infertile phase of her cycle, the cervix will be low in the vaginal canal; it will feel firm to the touch (like the tip of a person&#x27;s nose); and the os—the opening in the cervix—will be relatively small, or &quot;closed&quot;. As a woman becomes more fertile, the cervix will rise higher in the vaginal canal, it will become softer to the touch (more like a person&#x27;s lips), and the os will become more open. After ovulation has occurred, the cervix will revert to its infertile position.

==Cycle history==
Calendar-based systems determine both pre-ovulatory and post-ovulatory infertility based on cycle history. When used to avoid pregnancy, these systems have higher perfect-use failure rates than symptoms-based systems but are still comparable with barrier methods, such as diaphragms and cervical caps.

Mucus- and temperature-based methods used to determine post-ovulatory infertility, when used to avoid conception, result in very low perfect-use pregnancy rates. However, mucus and temperature systems have certain limitations in determining pre-ovulatory infertility. A temperature record alone provides no guide to fertility or infertility before ovulation occurs. Determination of pre-ovulatory infertility may be done by observing the absence of fertile cervical mucus; however, this results in a higher failure rate than that seen in the period of post-ovulatory infertility. Relying only on mucus observation also means that unprotected sexual intercourse is not allowed during menstruation, since any mucus would be obscured.

The use of certain calendar rules to determine the length of the pre-ovulatory infertile phase allows unprotected intercourse during the first few days of the menstrual cycle while maintaining a very low risk of pregnancy. With mucus-only methods, there is a possibility of incorrectly identifying mid-cycle or anovulatory bleeding as menstruation. Keeping a basal body temperature chart enables accurate identification of menstruation, when pre-ovulatory calendar rules may be reliably applied. In temperature-only systems, a calendar rule may be relied on alone to determine pre-ovulatory infertility. In symptothermal systems, the calendar rule is cross-checked by mucus records: observation of fertile cervical mucus overrides any calendar-determined infertility.

Calendar rules may set a standard number of days, specifying that (depending on a woman&#x27;s past cycle lengths) the first three to six days of each menstrual cycle are considered infertile. Or, a calendar rule may require calculation, for example holding that the length of the pre-ovulatory infertile phase is equal to the length of a woman&#x27;s shortest cycle minus 21 days. Rather than being tied to cycle length, a calendar rule may be determined from the cycle day on which a woman observes a thermal shift. One system has the length of the pre-ovulatory infertile phase equal to a woman&#x27;s earliest historical day of temperature rise minus seven days.

==Other techniques==
Ovulation predictor kits can detect imminent ovulation from the concentration of luteinizing hormone (LH) in a woman&#x27;s urine. A positive ovulation predictor kit result is usually followed by ovulation within 12–36 hours.

Saliva microscopes, when correctly used, can detect ferning structures in the saliva that precede ovulation. Ferning is usually detected beginning three days before ovulation, and continuing until ovulation has occurred. During this window, ferning structures occur in cervical mucus as well as saliva.

Computerized fertility monitors, such as Lady-Comp, are available under various brand names. These monitors may use BBT-only systems, they may analyze urine test strips, they may use symptothermal observations, they may monitor the electrical resistance of saliva and vaginal fluids, or a combination of any of these factors.

A symptohormonal method of fertility awareness method developed at Marquette University uses the ClearBlue Easy fertility monitor to determine the fertile window. The monitor measures estrogen and LH to determine the peak day. This method is also applicable during postpartum, breastfeeding, and perimenopause, and requires less abstinence than other fertility awareness method methods. Some couples prefer this method because the monitor reading is objective and is not affected by sleep quality as basal body temperature can be.

==Benefits and drawbacks==
Fertility awareness has a number of unique characteristics:

* Fertility awareness can be used to monitor reproductive health. Changes in the cycle can alert the user to emerging gynecological problems. Fertility awareness can also be used to aid in diagnosing known gynecological problems such as infertility.
* Fertility awareness may be used to avoid pregnancy or to aid in conception.
* Use of fertility awareness can give insight to the workings of women&#x27;s bodies, and may allow women to take greater control of their own fertility.
* Some symptoms-based forms of fertility awareness require observation or touching of cervical mucus, an activity with which some women are not comfortable. Some practitioners prefer to use the term &quot;cervical fluid&quot; to refer to cervical mucus, in an attempt to make the subject more acceptable to these women.
* Some drugs, such as decongestants, can change cervical mucus. In women taking these drugs, the mucus sign may not accurately indicate fertility.
* Some symptoms-based methods require tracking of basal body temperatures. Because irregular sleep can interfere with the accuracy of basal body temperatures, shift workers and those with very young children, for example, might not be able to use those methods.
* FA requires action daily—detailed record keeping. Some may find the time and detail requirements too complicated.

==As birth control==
By restricting unprotected sexual intercourse to the infertile portion of the menstrual cycle, a woman and her partner can prevent pregnancy. During the fertile portion of the menstrual cycle, the couple may use barrier contraception or abstain from sexual intercourse.

===Advantages===
* There are no drug-related side effects to fertility awareness.
* FA can be free or have a very low up-front cost. Users may employ a coach, use computer software, or buy a chart, calendar, or basal thermometer. The direct costs are low when compared to other methods.
* FA can be used with barrier contraception so that intercourse may continue through the fertile period. Unlike barrier use without FA, practicing FA can allow couples to use barrier contraception only when necessary.
* FA can be used to immediately switch from pregnancy avoidance to pregnancy planning if the couple decides it is time to plan for conception.

===Disadvantages===
*Use of a barrier or other backup method is required on fertile days; otherwise the couple must abstain. To reduce pregnancy risk to below 1% per year, there are an average of 13 days where abstinence or backup must be used during each cycle. For women with &quot;very&quot; irregular cycles—such as those common during breastfeeding, perimenopause, or with hormonal diseases such as PCOS—abstinence or the use of barriers may be required for months at a time.
*Typical use effectiveness is lower than most other methods.
*Fertility awareness does not protect against sexually transmitted disease.

===Effectiveness===
The effectiveness of fertility awareness, as of most forms of contraception, can be assessed two ways. &quot;Perfect use&quot; or &quot;method&quot; effectiveness rates only include people who follow all observational rules, correctly identify the fertile phase, and refrain from unprotected intercourse on days identified as fertile. &quot;Actual use&quot; or &quot;typical use&quot; effectiveness rates include all women relying on fertility awareness to avoid pregnancy, including those who fail to meet the &quot;perfect use&quot; criteria. Rates are generally presented for the first year of use. Most commonly, the Pearl Index is used to calculate effectiveness rates, but some studies use decrement tables.

The failure rate of fertility awareness varies widely depending on the system used to identify fertile days, the instructional method, and the population being studied. Some studies have found actual failure rates of 25% per year or higher. At least one study has found a failure rate of less than 1% per year with continuous intensive coaching and monthly review, and several studies have found actual failure rates of 2%–3% per year.

When used correctly and consistently (i.e., with perfect use) with ongoing coaching, under study conditions some studies have found some forms of FA to be 99% effective.

From &quot;Contraceptive Technology&quot;:

* Post-ovulation methods (i.e., abstaining from intercourse from menstruation until after ovulation) have a method failure rate of 1% per year.
* The symptothermal method has a method failure rate of 2% per year.
* Cervical mucus–only methods have a method failure rate of 3% per year.
* Calendar rhythm has a method failure rate of 9% per year.
* The Standard Days Method has a method failure rate of 5% per year.

===Reasons for lower typical-use effectiveness===
Several factors account for typical-use effectiveness being lower than perfect-use effectiveness:
* conscious user non-compliance with instructions (having unprotected intercourse on a day identified as fertile)
* mistakes on the part of those providing instructions on how to use the method (instructor providing incorrect or incomplete information on the rule system)
* mistakes on the part of the user (misunderstanding of rules, mistakes in charting)

The most common reason for the lower actual effectiveness is not mistakes on the part of instructors or users, but conscious user non-compliance—that is, the couple knowing that the woman is likely to be fertile at the time but engaging in sexual intercourse nonetheless. This is similar to failures of barrier methods, which are primarily caused by non-use of the method.

==To achieve pregnancy==

===Intercourse timing===
Timing intercourse with a person&#x27;s estimated &#x27;fertile window&#x27; is a practice sometimes called &#x27;timed intercourse&#x27;. The effectiveness of timed intercourse is not entirely clear, however, timed intercourse using urine tests that predict ovulation may help improve the rate of pregnancy and live births for some couples trying to conceive such as those who have been trying for less than 12-months and who are under 40 years old. It is not clear from medical evidence if timed intercourse improves the rate of ultra-sound confirmed pregnancies and it is also not clear if timed intercourse has an effect on a person&#x27;s level of stress or their quality of life. Pregnancy rates for sexual intercourse are also affected by several other factors. Regarding frequency, there are recommendations of sexual intercourse every 1 or 2 days, or every 2 or 3 days. Studies have shown no significant difference between different sex positions and pregnancy rate, as long as it results in ejaculation into the vagina. Social science research has found that timing intercourse can become a gendered &#x27;chore&#x27; in heterosexual married couples trying to conceive, with women tracking their ovulation cycles and dictating to their husbands when they should have sexual intercourse.

===Problem diagnosis===
Regular menstrual cycles are sometimes taken as evidence that a woman is ovulating normally, and irregular cycles as evidence she is not. However, many women with irregular cycles do ovulate normally, and some with regular cycles are actually anovulatory or have a luteal phase defect. Records of basal body temperatures, especially, but also of cervical mucus and position, can be used to accurately determine if a woman is ovulating, and if the length of the post-ovulatory (luteal) phase of her menstrual cycle is sufficient to sustain a pregnancy.

Fertile cervical mucus is important in creating an environment that allows sperm to pass through the cervix and into the fallopian tubes where they wait for ovulation. Fertility charts can help diagnose hostile cervical mucus, a common cause of infertility. If this condition is diagnosed, some sources suggest taking guaifenesin in the few days before ovulation to thin out the mucus.

===Pregnancy testing and gestational age===
Pregnancy tests are not accurate until 1–2 weeks after ovulation. Knowing an estimated date of ovulation can prevent a woman from getting false negative results due to testing too early. Also, 18 consecutive days of elevated temperatures means a woman is almost certainly pregnant. Estimated ovulation dates from fertility charts are a more accurate method of estimating gestational age than the traditional pregnancy wheel or last menstrual period (LMP) method of tracking menstrual periods. Because of high rates of very early miscarriage (25% of pregnancies are lost within the first six weeks since the woman&#x27;s last menstrual period), the methods used to detect pregnancy may lead to bias in conception rates. Less-sensitive methods will detect lower conception rates, because they miss the conceptions that resulted in early pregnancy loss.

<text>The Nicaraguan Canal and Development Project, informally the Nicaragua Canal (, also referred to as the Nicaragua Grand Canal, or the Grand Interoceanic Canal) was a proposed shipping route through Nicaragua to connect the Caribbean Sea (and therefore the Atlantic Ocean) with the Pacific Ocean. Scientists were concerned about the project&#x27;s environmental impact, as Lake Nicaragua is Central America&#x27;s key freshwater reservoir while the project&#x27;s viability was questioned by shipping experts and engineers.

Construction of a canal using the San Juan River as an access route to Lake Nicaragua was first proposed in the early colonial era. After the United States purchased the French interests in the Panama Canal in the early 20th century, it decided not to build in Nicaragua, but it secured rights and conducted studies for such a canal as a supplement.

In June 2013, Nicaragua&#x27;s National Assembly approved a bill to grant a 50-year concession to finance and manage the project to the HK Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Group (HKND) headed by Wang Jing, a Chinese businessman. The concession could have been extended for another 50 years once the waterway was operational.

In 2015, media reports suggested the project would be delayed and possibly cancelled because Wang&#x27;s personal wealth declined greatly as a result of the 2015–16 Chinese stock market crash. &quot;Major works&quot; such as dredging were to take place after the finishing of a Pacific Ocean wharf, whose construction was planned to start in late 2016. The Nicaraguan government failed to present reliable information about whether or not the project could be financed, thus casting doubt over whether it would be completed. The HKND Group stated that financing would come from debt and equity sales and a potential initial public offering (IPO).

By May 2017, no concrete action had been taken toward constructing the canal and further doubts were expressed about its financing. In February 2018, analysts widely viewed the project as defunct, though the head of the project insisted work was on-going and HKND, which closed its offices in April 2018, retained the legal rights to the concession for the canal and side projects.

In May 2024, Nicaragua&#x27;s congress canceled the concession to HKND.

== History ==

Until the beginning of the 20th century, before the opening of the Panama Canal, Nicaragua used to be the main overland trade route and hub of transshipment of goods between ocean-going vessels on the Atlantic side and those on the Pacific. In the meantime, the idea of constructing a man-made waterway through Central America has been thought about throughout history. The colonial administration of New Spain had conducted preliminary surveys. The routes suggested usually ran across Nicaragua, Panama, or the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico.

The history of attempts to build a canal across Nicaragua connecting the Caribbean Sea and thus the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean goes back at least to 1825 when the Federal Republic of Central America hired surveyors to study a route via Lake Nicaragua, above sea level. Many other proposals have followed. Despite the operation of the Panama Canal, which opened in 1914, interest in a Nicaragua canal has continued. With emergence of globalization, an increase in commerce and the cost of fuel, and the limitations of the Panama Canal, the concept of a second canal across the American land bridge became more attractive, and in 2006 the president of Nicaragua, Enrique Bolaños, announced an intention to proceed with such a project. Even with the Panama Canal expansion project, which began commercial operation to allow modern New Panamax vessels on 26 June 2016, some ships would be too big for the Panama Canal.

On 26 September 2012, the Nicaraguan Government and the newly formed Hong Kong Nicaragua Canal Development Group (HKND) signed a memorandum of understanding that committed HKND to financing and building the &quot;Nicaraguan Canal and Development Project&quot;. HKND Group is a private enterprise.

The Nicaraguan government subsequently approved the &quot;Master Concession Agreement&quot; with HKND on 13 June 2013 thereby granting &quot;the sole rights to the HKND Group to plan, design, construct and thereafter to operate and manage the Nicaragua Grand Canal and other related projects, including ports, a free trade zone, an international airport and other infrastructure development projects&quot;. The agreement would have lasted for 50 years and was renewable for another 50 years. HKND would have paid the government of Nicaragua US$10M annually for 10 years, and thereafter a portion of the revenue starting at 1% and increasing later.
Stratfor indicated that after 10 years, ownership shares would periodically be handed over to Nicaragua, so that after 50 years Nicaragua would be the majority shareholder.

The HKND Group performed a preliminary study phase of development to assess the technological and economic feasibility of constructing a canal in Nicaragua, as well as the potential environmental, social, and regional implications of various routes. The canal and other associated projects would be financed by investors throughout the world and would generate jobs for Nicaragua and other Central American countries.

Initial findings of the commercial analysis conducted by HKND Group indicate that the combined effect of growth in east–west trade and in ship sizes could provide a compelling argument for the construction of a second canal, substantially larger than the expanded Panama Canal, across Central America. The projection at the time was that in the 2020s, growth in global maritime trade is expected to cause congestion and delays in transit through the Panama Canal without a complementary route through the isthmus, and by 2030, the volume of trade that a Nicaragua Canal could serve would have grown by 240%.

On 10 June 2013, The Associated Press reported that the National Assembly&#x27;s Infrastructure Committee voted nearly unanimously in favor of the project, with four members abstaining. On 13 June, Nicaragua&#x27;s legislature passed the legislation granting the concession. On 15 June, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and the billionaire chairman of HKND Group, Wang Jing, signed the concession agreement giving HKND Group the rights to construct and manage the canal and associated projects for 50 years. An HKND Group press release read, &quot;HKND Group successfully obtains exclusive right to develop and manage Nicaragua Grand Canal for 100 years.&quot; Under the exclusive contract, Wang could skip building the canal (and making any payments to Nicaragua) and instead simply operate lucrative tax-free side projects.

Wang announced at a press briefing in June 2013 that he had successfully attracted global investors to the $40 billion project. In January 2014, Wang and Ortega issued a statement that the project&#x27;s construction would begin in December 2014 and end in 2019.

On 7 July 2014, a route for the Nicaragua Canal was approved. The proposed route started from the mouth of the Brito River on the Pacific side, passed through Lake Nicaragua, and ended in the Punta Gorda River on the Caribbean. The proposed canal would be between wide and deep. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; noted that Chinese engineer Dong Yung Song said the canal&#x27;s design called for the creation of a artificial lake. The water to fill the canal&#x27;s giant locks would come from the artificial lake, not from Lake Nicaragua.

Ortega, whose government approved the agreement within one week in June 2013, reportedly perceived the canal as the second phase of the Nicaraguan Revolution, predicting that it would pull Nicaragua out of poverty and lead to the creation of 250,000 jobs; HKND said the project would create 50,000 jobs, about half from abroad, mainly China.

&quot;The Moscow Times&quot; reported in 2014 that Russia was willing to help build the Nicaragua Canal, viewing the project in part as an opportunity to pursue strategic interests in the region. Construction was to begin on 29 December 2014, and officially started a week earlier. However, owing to Nicaragua&#x27;s volatile climate and seismic activity, feasibility concerns emerged over the project&#x27;s future. In November 2015, HKND announced that they would postpone the construction of locks and excavations to late 2016 to fine-tune the design.

The Nicaraguan Canal and Development Project saw business rivalry greatly intensify in late 2014. China Harbor Engineering Company, an experienced construction company, offered to design, construct, and finance a fourth set of locks in Panama, where it opened a regional headquarters. If built to the width of the proposed Nicaragua Canal, it would cut across a far shorter distance, and still cost only $10 billion, according to the firm. Panama is in a better financial situation than Nicaragua to afford taking on this project in that it already has a stream of income from its existing canals.

Alternative motives have been explored and other projects have taken priority against the water transportation venture. Bloomberg reported in 2015 that &quot;conspiracy theories abound&quot; including the project was a land grab by Ortega, an attempt by Ortega to &quot;whip up&quot; support in elections, and part of a Chinese plan to gain influence in the region.

By November 2016, the president of the canal commission, Manual Coronel Kautz said &quot;According to our schedule, we should initiate major works by the end of the year.&quot; However, Carlos Fernando Chamorro, editor of the Confidencial newspaper, said &quot;If the People&#x27;s Republic of China does not step forward, it won&#x27;t happen. Wang Jing does not have the reputation to push this through. If it is just him, then the chances of this happening are zero. If the PRC steps in, then it is a big possibility.&quot;

Following financial difficulties, HKND finally closed its headquarters offices in China in April 2018, leaving no forwarding address or telephone numbers to be reached.

=== Opposition ===
Protests against the canal&#x27;s construction occurred shortly after the official ceremony marking its beginning. Farmers feared it could cause their eviction and land expropriation.

The vast land expropriations () under land expropriation Canal Law 840 enacted in 2013 include a concession for carrying out seven sub-projects, among them ports, oil pipelines, free-trade zones, and developing tourist areas that could be realized in any part of the national territory. In particular, this law denies any right to appeal against the expropriation decision and provides a derisory level of compensation. It also allows the investor (HKND) to buy and sell its rights over the various sub-projects &quot;in parts&quot;, which is a highly profitable enterprise. This has been called a &quot;land grab&quot; and it has prompted protests, and some violent confrontations against security forces. Activists noted that the canal contract established that it must be dissolved in 72 months, if the investor has not obtained the money to start the project; that deadline was 14 June 2019, so they assert that the Law 840 must be repealed.

Opposition leader Eliseo Nuñez has called the deal &quot;part of one of the biggest international scams in the world&quot;. Legal challenges that the deal violates constitutional rights were rejected by the Supreme Court of Nicaragua and a retrospective rewriting of the Constitution of Nicaragua placed HKND beyond legal challenge. HKND has been granted the right to expropriate land within on each side of the canal and pay only cadastral value, not market value, for property. Wang, however, promised to pay fair market value. The estimates of the number of people who would be displaced range from 29,000 to more than 100,000. There are indications of local opposition to intended expropriations. Thus, according to an activist leader, an unrest in Rivas in December 2014, in opposition to the canal, left two protesters dead, although no evidence was ever produced to justify his claim. The CIDH, Nicaragua&#x27;s Human Rights Commission, has strongly criticized the government for not looking into the project&#x27;s effect on citizens, amid claims that citizens were not involved in decision-making. The British firm ERM, who carried out the Environmental Impact Assessment, claims it held consultations with around 6,000 people in the communities along its planned route, and estimated that the property of about 30,000 people would be affected. National opinion polls show that support for the project is about 70%.

=== Reported end to the canal project ===
Investor Wang had financial setbacks unrelated to the Nicaragua project, losing 80% of his net worth during the 2015–16 Chinese stock market turbulence. In March 2017, the &quot;Havana Times&quot; reported that the public relations agency handling Wang&#x27;s interests in Nicaragua had been let go, in absence of any developments on the project to report, and Wang had not been in the country in more than two years. In May 2017, the &quot;PanAm Post&quot; indicated that &quot;no concrete action has been taken to begin the project&quot; and suggested that the project was either &quot;paralyzed, or nonexistent.&quot; In September 2017 Agence France-Presse reported that the work had been &quot;pushed back indefinitely,&quot; although the government renewed the project&#x27;s environmental permit in April 2017.

In February 2018, Manuel Coronel Kautz, head of Interoceanic Grand Canal Authority of Nicaragua, told Agence France-Presse work on the canal was still ongoing, but by that point analysts and activists widely viewed the canal project as defunct, with China having shifted its investment focus to Panama, the main competitor to a Nicaraguan canal. Following financial difficulties, HKND finally closed its offices in April 2018, leaving no forwarding address or telephone numbers to be reached.

Absent a 60% vote to revoke the legislation, HKND maintains the legal concessions established by the 2013 law, including for other infrastructures projects in Nicaragua, including ports, roads, railway and an airport.

In November 2024 the Nicaraguan Canal idea has been revived.

== Description ==
The construction company provided a project description for review on open source, dated December 2014. The canal as planned would have been and would have three sections. The West Canal runs from Brito on the Pacific Ocean up the Rio Brito valley, crosses the continental divide, and after passing through the Rio Las Lajas valley enters Lake Nicaragua; its length would be . The Lake Nicaragua section measures and runs from south of San Jorge to south of San Miguelito. The East Canal would be the longest section at and would be built along the Rio Tule valley through the Caribbean highland to the Rio Punta Gorda valley to meet the Caribbean Sea. A channel would have to be dug in the bottom of Lake Nicaragua, as it is not deep enough for large vessels to transit the canal.

Both the West Canal and the East Canal would each have one lock with 3 consecutive chambers to raise ships to the level of Lake Nicaragua, which has an average water elevation of , with a range between . The western Brito Lock would be inland from the Pacific, and the eastern Camilo Lock would be inland from the Caribbean Sea. The dimensions of each of the locks&#x27; chambers are long, wide, and threshold depth. As locks generally define the limit on the size of ships that can be handled, the Nicaragua Canal would have allowed passage for larger ships than those that pass through the Panama Canal. For comparison the Panama Canal, after its 2016 expansion, is only long, wide, and deep.

No water from Lake Nicaragua was planned to be used to flood the locks; water would have come from local rivers and recycling using water-saving basins. The Camilo lock would have been built adjacent to a new dam of the upper Punta Gorda River that creates a reservoir. This Atlanta Reservoir (or Lake Atlanta) would have a surface area of . West of the Atlanta reservoir, the Rio Agua Zarca would have been dammed to create a second reservoir. This reservoir would have had a surface area of and hold . A hydropower facility would be built at the dam and would have generated over 10 megawatts of power to be used for Camilo Lock operations. Both locks would also be connected to the country&#x27;s power grid and have back-up generator facilities. It was estimated that each lock would have used about 9 megawatts of power.

At each oceanic canal entrance, breakwaters and port facilities would have been constructed. The Pacific port would be named Brito Port and the Caribbean one Aguila Port. Initially these two ports would have helped during construction and later become international ports. Their design capacity was 1.68 million TEU/year and 2.5 million TEU/year, respectively. Existing port facilities at Corinto and Bluefields would have been improved to allow for shipment of material to the entry ports under construction. Fuel storage sites would be placed at the two port sites. Four lighthouses would be constructed at the entrances to the East and West Canals. In addition, the channel entrance on sea would have been be marked on both sides with a large sailing buoy about offshore and 2 light buoys would mark the passage through Lake Nicaragua.

A free trade zone with commercial facilities as well as tourist hotels and an international airport at Rivas were planned to be built when canal construction was advanced.

Appropriate road improvements were planned. The Pan-American Highway would have crossed the canal via a bridge. Nicaragua Route 25 (Acoyapa-San Carlos) on the eastern side of Lake Nicaragua would have gotten a ferry service. Both ports would get public road connections. HKND planned to construct a private gravel maintenance road on both sides of the canal.

The estimate for the workforce in 2020 was 3,700 people, and 12,700 in 2050 when traffic had increased.

Transit time would have been about 30 hours. It was projected that by 2020 3,576 ships would have transited the canal annually. The transit rate was expected to increase to 4,138 by 2030, and to 5,097 by 2050. For comparison, the Panama Canal handled 12,855 transits in 2009.

== Construction ==
No significant construction took place. No &quot;major works&quot; such as dredging were planned to take place until after a Pacific Ocean wharf was built.

The apparent lack of experience of Wang and his HKND in large-scale engineering was cited as a risk.

On December 22, 2014, Wang announced construction started in Rivas, Nicaragua. Wang spoke during the starting ceremony of the first works of the Interoceanic Grand Canal in Brito town. Construction of the new waterway would have been by HKND Group—Hong Kong–based HK Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Co Ltd., which is controlled by Wang. According to HKND&#x27;s announced plans in 2015, the project entailed the canal&#x27;s development and building, and supporting infrastructure. There would have been four main phases. The preconstruction phase included getting permits, acquiring land and machinery, and finalizing designs and plans. The early construction phase, started in December 2014, lasted through September 2015; it secured access to construction sites, but it did not provide the critical infrastructure nor mobilize the workforce. During the construction phase from September 2015 to March 2020, the canal would have been dug and the locks built along with accompanying infrastructure. The commissioning phase projected from April 2020 to June 2020 included lock testing and lock and tug boat operator training.

HKND described the project as the largest civil earth-moving operation in history. Most of this would have consisted of dry excavation to form the canal with an estimate of 4,019 MCM of rock and soil. There would have been 739 MCM of freshwater dredging (Lake Nicaragua) and 241 MCM of marine dredging. Marine dredging of the oceanic access canal would be required on the Pacific side for and on the Caribbean Sea side for . Disposal of excavation material would have been done along the canal in designated disposal areas typically within of the canal.

Two concrete plants and a steel plant were planned to support the project. While cement would have likely been imported, construction aggregate would have come from local quarries near the two locks.

HKND estimates that about 50,000 people would be employed during the five-year construction, about half of them from Nicaragua, 25% from China, and the remainder from various other countries. 1,400 workers would be in office or administrative positions and the rest in the field. The management offices would be rented or purchased near Rivas. Workers would live in one of nine camps, which besides food and shelter would also provide health care and security. These are “closed” camps — that is, workers cannot leave the camp unless part of an organized activity. The work schedule calls for 12 hour shifts for 7 days a week. Domestic workers work two weeks and get one week off, while foreign workers are 6 weeks on and get 2 weeks off (management) or 22 weeks on, 4 weeks off (blue collar workers).

On 2 September 2015, Pang Wai Kwok (executive VP of HKND Group) was interviewed by Nicaraguan journalist Carlos Solis and said up to 3,000 people might be employed on the canal project within the year. However, the labor force depends on the contract bid&#x27;s winner and Kwok said anyone in the world is eligible to work on the canal.

=== Financing ===
Project costs were estimated in the region of $40 billion to $50 billion. Beside private money provided by Wang at the start-up, further influx of financial support was expected from investors. An IPO was reported to be in preparation by the end of 2014. XCMG, a state-owned Chinese construction company would have provided machinery and taken 1.5% to 3% of HKND shares in return.

By the end of 2014, no major investors had been named. There had been speculation that the Chinese government would provide financial backing for the project, but China, as well as Wang, denied this. Wang lost nearly 85% of his wealth during the 2015 Chinese stock market crash, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In addition, Wang has had a string of setbacks for projects around the world since 2014. The economic development potential for the canal project is relatively measurable with Panama; however, the World Bank describes the country of Nicaragua as the second poorest in Latin America and the Caribbean. The World Bank has compiled a data list of projects that the impoverished nation has on record and the majority of the efforts are geared towards infrastructure and agricultural needs, but there is no explicit title project that would support the canal line of effort.

Wang admitted that the project has financial, political, and engineering risks. With the high cost of the project that independently has been estimated to be about $100 billion, it was not fully funded. The project was expected in 2014 to be completed in 2020, but Stratfor, an analyst agency, stated then that was an &quot;unrealistic goal.&quot;

While the Nicaraguan National Bank reserves served as collateral on the part of Nicaragua, HKND had no such potential liability.

== Impact ==

=== Environmental ===
Some of the natural habitat of at least 22 endangered species would be destroyed in the construction. Another major environmental concern is the project&#x27;s impact on Lake Nicaragua, the largest source of freshwater in Nicaragua. An oil spill would have serious and lasting consequences. Other problems include the possibility of dredging bringing up toxic sediments, the disruption of migration patterns of animal species, and the potential to introduce invasive species to the lake. Environmental studies had not been released by HKND when the project officially started in December 2014. The Nicaraguan Academy of Sciences noted that hundreds of thousands of hectares of pristine forests and wetlands would be destroyed and pointed out that the environmental study performed for the canal was not independent.

President Daniel Ortega stated that he is &quot;not concerned about harming the lake because it is already contaminated.&quot; Protesters fear that the canal would bring massive environmental destruction to Lake Nicaragua and the Atlantic Autonomous Regions. 400,000 hectares of tropical rain forest and wetlands would be destroyed. It would also encroach upon the habitats of animals such as Baird&#x27;s tapir, the spider monkey, and the jaguar.

==== Safety ====
Richard Condit, from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, believes that the project could be used as leverage for forest protection in a country that currently lacks &quot;institutional capacity&quot; to meet conservation needs. A Canadian pilot was the first fatality during the canal project. The pilot was flying alone on the western side of Lake Nicaragua during an aerial survey.

==== Sustainability ====
The survey site was on the same side as NicarAgua–Dulce, which is the only ecotourism group in Nicaragua that is affiliated with The International Ecotourism Society, and it is located north of the proposed canal site. Falling in line with ecotourism, Nicaragua&#x27;s Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources has promoted formal workshops at each level of education (primary, secondary, and post-secondary); however, there is no curriculum relevant to the pending canal project. The American-led Foundation for Sustainable Development is another partner that provides training initiatives to Nicaraguans that cannot access formal education. One of FSD&#x27;s support sites is located at Tola, which is within close proximity of the proposed Brito–Pacific canal opening.

=== Economic ===
As the original Panama Canal still has capacity for Panamax-sized shipping and Panama has completed its Panama Canal expansion project, adding more capacity and allowing transit for even larger New Panamax size ships, projections for the Nicaragua Canal&#x27;s traffic may be optimistic. While the proposed Nicaragua Canal would be wide enough to accommodate Triple E class mega container ships, which are too wide for the expanded Panama Canal, few ports are able to accommodate these ships at the present time. Further, a coast-to-coast railway line may be built by China in Honduras and could affect use of the Nicaragua Canal. Also, North American overland shipping through Pacific ports in Mexico and the United States will compete in the traffic between Asia and the U.S. east coast. The collective effect of the above is that competition may undermine the Nicaragua Canal&#x27;s economic viability if it were ever built. On the other hand, the combined effect of climate change and poor water-management of the 2016 Panama Canal expansion has resulted in severe bottlenecks which are expected to be exacerbated by future drought conditions. With better water management, and the ability to accommodate dramatically larger vessels, the Nicaragua Canal could supplant other freight options over the next 50 years. 

The canal would affect neighboring economies, like Honduras and El Salvador, as they are part of the commercial treaty known as the Northern Triangle of Central America (Triángulo Norte de Centroamérica). The GDP of each nation would be influenced by expanded export / import operations and trade cooperation through agencies like the promotion authority in El Salvador.

=== Social ===
According to the official Environmental Impact Assessment carried out by ERM, the canal would require the relocation of around 30,000 people. However, according to human rights group Amnesty International it would &quot;forcibly displace an estimated 120,000 people, including Rama and Creole communities, from protected indigenous territories on the Caribbean coast.&quot; The report claims that communities established in proposed canal area have been visited by foreigners, guarded by Nicaraguan authorities, measuring the lands of the inhabitants, and that legislation passed by the Ortega government &quot;authorizes HKND to expropriate whatever land it wants, while denying displaced families the right to appeal.&quot; Amnesty International goes on to say that &quot;...excessive forces and unjust arrests have been performed by Nicaraguan officials&quot;. The Nicaraguan government&#x27;s 2015 report on the canal counters that, while people will be moved from their current villages, &quot;The Nicaraguan government and HKND will guarantee that persons and families on the route of the canal&#x27;s construction will have living conditions &quot;superior to&quot; those they currently have.&quot;
