<doc id="20212" wikidata="Q5059" url="?curid=20212" title="Aoraki / Mount Cook">
<text>Aoraki / Mount Cook is the highest mountain in New Zealand. Its height, , is listed as . It is situated in the Southern Alps, the mountain range that runs the length of the South Island. A popular tourist destination, it is also a favourite challenge for mountain climbers. Aoraki / Mount Cook consists of three summits: from south to north, the Low Peak (), the Middle Peak () and the High Peak. The summits lie slightly south and east of the main divide of the Southern Alps, with the Tasman Glacier to the east and the Hooker Glacier to the southwest. Mount Cook is ranked 10th in the world by topographic isolation.

== Location ==
The mountain is in the Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park, in the Canterbury Region. The park was established in 1953 and along with Westland Tai Poutini National Park, Mount Aspiring National Park and Fiordland National Park forms one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The park contains more than 140 peaks standing over and 72 named glaciers, which cover 40 percent of its .

The peak is located at the northern end of the Mount Cook Range, where it meets with the main spine of the Main Divide, forming a massif between the Hooker Valley to the southwest and the Tasman Valley east of the mountain. These two valleys provide the closest easily accessible view points of Aoraki / Mount Cook. A lookout point at the end of the Hooker Valley Track located only from the peak has views of the entire mountainside.

The settlement of Mount Cook Village, also referred to as &quot;Aoraki / Mount Cook&quot;, is a tourist centre and base camp for the mountain. It is from the end of the Tasman Glacier and south of Aoraki / Mount Cook&#x27;s summit.

On clear days, Aoraki / Mount Cook is visible from the West Coast as far north as Greymouth, some away, and from most of State Highway 80 along Lake Pukaki and State Highway 6 south of Lake Pukaki. The near horizontal ridge connecting the mountain&#x27;s three summits forms a distinctive blocky shape when viewed from an eastern or western direction.
Another popular view point is from Lake Matheson on the West Coast, described as the &quot;view of views&quot;, where on calm days, the peaks of Aoraki / Mount Cook and Mt Tasman are reflected in Lake Matheson.

==Local climate==
Aoraki / Mount Cook receives substantial orographic precipitation throughout the year, as breezy, moisture-laden westerly winds dominate all year-round, bringing rainclouds from the Tasman Sea with them.

Annual precipitation around the mountain ranges varies greatly as the local climate is dominated by the eastward movement of depressions and anticyclones from across the Tasman Sea. The Aoraki / Mount Cook massif is a major obstacle to the prevailing westerly winds as they push depressions and associated cold fronts of moist air from the subtropics in the northwest against the mountain range. As the air rises towards the peaks, it expands and cools, and forms clouds. Rain and snowfall are often heaviest around the level and can last for several days if the front is slow-moving.

As a result of the local weather patterns, the western slopes of Aoraki / Mount Cook can receive well over of annual precipitation, whereas the nearby Mount Cook Village, only south of the mountain, receives of rain or snowfall.
While the weather on the eastern side of the mountain is generally better, rain or snow can quickly become widespread on that side as well if the wind turns to the south or southeast. This brings with it a rapid drop in temperature and poor visibility, adding to the difficult climbing conditions on Aoraki / Mount Cook.

Temperatures at the mountain&#x27;s base in the Hooker Valley around range from to , and generally fall just over 1 °C (1.8 °F) for every of altitude.

From about and higher, semi-permanent snow and ice fields exist during winter. Winter and spring are usually less settled than summer and autumn. Anticyclones often bring days of settled weather in summer, or clear cold conditions in winter with severe frost.

== Naming and European discovery ==

In the traditions of the Ngāi Tahu iwi an early name for the South Island is &#x27; (&#x27;Aoraki&#x27;s Canoe&#x27;). In the past many believed it meant &quot;Cloud Piercer&quot;, a romantic rendering of the name&#x27;s components: &#x27; (world, daytime, cloud, etc.) and &#x27; or &#x27; (day, sky, weather, etc.). Historically, the Māori name has been spelt &quot;&quot;, using the northern dialect.

Aoraki / Mount Cook became known to Māori after their arrival in New Zealand some time around the 14th century CE. The first Europeans who may have seen Aoraki / Mount Cook were members of Abel Tasman&#x27;s crew, who saw a &quot;large land uplifted high&quot; (probably some part of the Southern Alps) while off the west coast of the South Island, just north of present-day Greymouth on 13 December 1642 during Tasman&#x27;s first Pacific voyage. The English name of &quot;Mount Cook&quot; was given to the mountain in 1851 by Captain John Lort Stokes to honour Captain James Cook who surveyed and circumnavigated the islands of New Zealand in 1770. Captain Cook did not sight the mountain during his exploration.

Following the settlement between Ngāi Tahu and the Crown in 1998, a number of South Island place names were amended to incorporate their Māori names by the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998. The name of the mountain was officially changed from Mount Cook to Aoraki/Mount Cook to incorporate its historic Māori name. It is the only one of these names where the Māori name precedes the English. Under the settlement the Crown agreed to return title of Aoraki / Mount Cook to Ngāi Tahu, who would then formally gift it back to the nation. Neither transfer has yet occurred, and Ngāi Tahu can decide when this will happen.

== Geology ==

The Southern Alps in the South Island were formed by tectonic uplifting and pressure as the Pacific and Indo-Australian Plates collided along the island&#x27;s western coast. The uplifting continues, raising Aoraki / Mount Cook an average of each year. However, erosive forces are also powerful shapers of the mountains. The severe weather is due to the mountain&#x27;s jutting into powerful westerly winds of the Roaring Forties which run around approximately 45°S latitude, south of both Africa and Australia. The Southern Alps are the first obstacle the winds encounter after South America, having moved east across the Southern Ocean.

The height of Aoraki / Mount Cook was established in 1881 by G. J. Roberts (from the west side) and in 1889 by T. N. Brodrick (from the Canterbury side). Their measurements agreed closely at . The height was reduced by when approximately 12–14 million cubic metres of rock and ice fell off the northern peak on 14 December 1991. Two decades of erosion of the ice cap exposed after this collapse reduced the height by another 30 m to 3,724 m,

Aoraki / Mount Cook lies in the centre of the distinctive Alpine Fault, a 650 km long active fault in the Southern Alps. It is responsible for the uplift of Aoraki / Mount Cook and is believed to move every 100 to 300 years. It last moved in 1717.

== Surrounding forests and glaciers ==

The average annual rainfall in the surrounding lowlands, in particular to the west, is around . This very high rainfall leads to temperate rainforests in these coastal lowlands and a reliable source of snow in the mountains to keep the glaciers flowing. These include the Tasman Glacier to the east of the mountain and the smaller Hooker Glacier immediately to its south.

The vegetation in the valleys to the east, in particular the Tasman Valley, is noticeably less lush than that on the western slopes of the mountain. Forest would normally grow to about 1,300 m in this area, but a lack of soil due to scree, rock falls and the effects of glaciation prevent this in most localities around the mountain. Snow tussock and other alpine plants cling to as high as 1,900 m.
Above the snowline, only lichen can be found amongst the rock, snowfields and ice that dominate the highest parts of Aoraki / Mount Cook.

== Climbing history ==

The first recorded attempt on the summit was made by the Irishman Rev. William S. Green, the Swiss hotelier Emil Boss, and the Swiss mountain guide Ulrich Kaufmann on 2 March 1882 via the Tasman and Linda Glaciers. They came within a few feet of the top, as did the 1890 ascent attempt by Mannering and Dixon.

The first known ascent was on 25 December 1894, when New Zealanders Tom Fyfe, John Michael (Jack) Clarke and George Graham reached the summit via the Hooker Valley and the north ridge. Despite an earlier failed attempt on 20 December, the local climbers were spurred on by their desire for the first ascent to be made by New Zealand mountaineers amid reports that the American mountaineer Edward FitzGerald had his eye on the summit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aoraki/Mt Cook&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The party reached the summit at approximately 1:30pm after bounding up the last leg of the mountain full of excitement at reaching the top. The route they had successfully traversed was not repeated again until the 100th ascent over 60 years later in 1955. 

Swiss guide Matthias Zurbriggen of FitzGerald&#x27;s party made the second ascent on 14 March 1895 from the Tasman Glacier side, via the ridge that now bears his name. This is credited as the first solo ascent, although Zurbriggen was accompanied part of the way up the ridge by J Adamson. After Zurbriggen&#x27;s ascent it was another ten years before the mountain was climbed again. In February 1905 Jack Clarke with four others completed the third ascent following Zurbriggen&#x27;s route. Clarke therefore became the first person to do a repeat ascent.

The first woman to ascend the mountain was Australian Freda Du Faur on 3 December 1910. Local guide George Bannister, a nephew of another guide, Butler Te Koeti of Ngāi Tahu, was the first Māori to successfully scale the peak in 1912.
A traverse of the three peaks was first accomplished in 1913 by Freda Du Faur and guides Alec and Peter Graham. This &#x27;grand traverse&#x27; was repeated in January 1916 by Conrad Kain, guiding the 57-year-old Jane Thomson, considered at the time &quot;a marvellous feat unequalled for daring in the annals of the Southern Alps&quot;.

Sir Edmund Hillary made his first ascent in January 1948. In February 1948 with Ruth Adams, Harry Ayres and Mick Sullivan, Hillary made the first ascent of the South Ridge to the Low Peak. To celebrate the life of Hillary the South Ridge was renamed as Hillary Ridge in August 2011.

Aoraki / Mount Cook is a technically challenging mountain with a high level of glaciation. Its level of difficulty is often underestimated and can change dramatically depending on weather, snow and ice conditions. The climb crosses large crevasses, and involves risks of ice and rock falls, avalanches and rapidly changing weather conditions.

Since the early 20th century, around 80 people have died attempting to climb the mountain, making it New Zealand&#x27;s deadliest peak. The climbing season traditionally runs from November to February, and hardly a season goes by without at least one fatality.

== Māori history, legends and traditions ==

According to Māori legend, Aoraki was a young boy who, along with his three brothers, were the sons of Rakinui, the Sky Father. On their voyage around the Papatūānuku, the Earth Mother, their canoe became stranded on a reef and tilted. Aoraki and his brothers climbed onto the top side of their canoe. However, the south wind froze them and turned them to stone. Their canoe became the Te Waka o Aoraki, the South Island, and their prows, the Marlborough Sounds. Aoraki, the tallest, became the highest peak, and his brothers created the Kā Tiritiri o te Moana, the Southern Alps.

Ngāi Tahu, the main iwi (tribe) of New Zealand&#x27;s southern region, consider Aoraki as the most sacred of the ancestors that they had descended from. Aoraki brings the iwi with its sense of community and purpose, and remains the physical form of Aoraki and the link between the worlds of the supernatural and nature.

<text>Multiple-image Network Graphics (MNG) is a graphics file format published in 2001 for animated images. Its specification is publicly documented and there are free software reference implementations available.

MNG is closely related to the PNG image format. When PNG development started in early 1995, developers decided not to incorporate support for animation, because the majority of the PNG developers felt that overloading a single file type with both still and animation features is a bad design, both for users (who have no simple way of determining to which class a given image file belongs) and for web servers (which should use a MIME type starting with image/ for stills and video/ for animations—GIF notwithstanding), but work soon started on MNG as an animation-supporting version of PNG. Version 1.0 of the MNG specification was released on 31 January 2001.

==File support==

===Support===
Gwenview has native MNG support. GIMP can export images as MNG files. Imagemagick can create a MNG file from a series of PNG files. With the MNG plugin, Irfanview can read a MNG file. If MPlayer is linked against libmng, it and all its graphical front-ends like Gnome MPlayer can display MNG files.

Mozilla browsers and Netscape 6.0, 6.01 and 7.0 included native support for MNG until the code was removed in 2003 due to code size and little actual usage, causing complaints on the Mozilla development site. Mozilla later added support for APNG as a simpler alternative. Similarly, early versions of the Konqueror browser included MNG support but it was later dropped. MNG support was never included in Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Opera, or Safari.
===Server support===
Web servers generally don&#x27;t come pre-configured to support MNG files.

The MNG developers had hoped that MNG would replace GIF for animated images on the World Wide Web, just as PNG had done for still images. However, with the expiration of LZW patents and existence of alternative file formats such as APNG, Flash and SVG, combined with lack of MNG-supporting viewers and services, web usage was far less than expected.

==Technical details==
The structure of MNG files is essentially the same as that of PNG files, differing only in the slightly different signature (codice_1 in hexadecimal, where codice_2 is ASCII for &quot;MNG&quot; – see Portable Network Graphics: File header) and the use of a much greater variety of chunks to support all the animation features that it provides. Images to be used in the animation are stored in the MNG file as encapsulated PNG or JNG images.

Two versions of MNG of reduced complexity are also defined: MNG-LC (low complexity) and MNG-VLC (very low complexity). These allow applications to include some level of MNG support without having to implement the entire MNG specification, just as the SVG standard offers the &quot;SVG Basic&quot; and &quot;SVG Tiny&quot; subsets.

MNG does not have a registered MIME media type, but codice_3 or codice_4 can be used.
MNG animations may be included in HTML pages using the codice_5 or codice_6 tag.

MNG can either be lossy or lossless, depending whether the frames are encoded in PNG (lossless) or JNG (lossy).

==Alternatives==
Most modern web browsers support animations in APNG, SVG, WebP, and WebM. only Apple Safari supports HEIF and JPEG XL. The most common alternatives have been Animated GIF and – up until its deprecation in 2017 – Adobe Flash. GIF images are restricted to 256 colors with limited compression, but the format is supported in all graphical web browsers and is still widely used. 

Animations can be generated ad hoc in a browser with the CSS 3 features animations, transitions, and sprites, or also the JavaScript web animations API, by specifying frames or motions of still images or rendered shapes. This can be resource-intensive, and the animation generally cannot be saved in a portable image file or posted on imageboards.

Internet Explorer only supported GIF, CSS, and Flash animations.

<text>John Smith Hurt (March 8, 1893 – November 2, 1966), known as Mississippi John Hurt, was an American country blues singer, songwriter, and guitarist.

==Biography==
===Early years===
John Hurt was born in Teoc, Carroll County, Mississippi and raised in Avalon, Mississippi. His parents, Isom and Mary, had both been slaves and as was common after the Civil War, they continued working on the same plantation, now as sharecroppers, for the same master.

John taught himself to play guitar at the age of nine. To earn extra money, his mother took in boarders. One of them, William Henry Carson, who played a guitar and was a friend of John&#x27;s mother, often stayed at the Hurt home while courting a woman who lived nearby. When no one was around, John would play Carson&#x27;s guitar. As a youth, he played old-time music for friends and at dances or at the local general store. His syncopated playing style was ideal for dancing.

He worked as a farmhand and sharecropper, sometimes working for the railroad into the 1920s. On occasion, a medicine show came through the area. Hurt recalled that one wanted to hire him: &quot;One of them wanted me, but I said no because I just never wanted to get away from home.&quot;

===First recordings===
In 1923, he played with the fiddle player Willie Narmour as a substitute for Narmour&#x27;s regular partner, Shell Smith. When Narmour won first place in a fiddle contest in 1928 and got a chance to record for Okeh Records, he recommended Hurt, who by that time had a good reputation, to Okeh producer Tommy Rockwell. After auditioning &quot;Monday Morning Blues&quot; at his home, Hurt took part in two recording sessions where he recorded 20 songs, in Memphis and New York City. While in Memphis, he recalled seeing &quot;many, many blues singers ... Lonnie Johnson, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Bessie Smith, and lots, lots more.&quot; Hurt described his first recording session:

The records sold modestly well, not only with the black community but also among southern whites. Hurt attempted further negotiations with Okeh to record again but Okeh declined since his record sales were only modest. Okeh went out of business during the Great Depression, and Hurt returned to Avalon and obscurity, working as a sharecropper and playing at local parties and dances.

=== Rediscovery and death ===

In 1952, musicologist Harry Smith included John&#x27;s version of Frankie and Johnny (song) and Spike Driver Blues in his seminal collection The Anthology of American Folk Music which generated considerable interest in locating him. When a copy of his Avalon Blues was discovered in 1963, it led musicologist Dick Spottswood to locate Avalon, Mississippi on a map and ask his friend, Tom Hoskins, who was traveling that way, to enquire after Hurt.

&quot;Avalon, my home town, always on my mind / Avalon, my home town.&quot; &quot;Avalon Blues&quot;

Upon locating Hurt, Hoskins persuaded him to perform several songs, to ensure that he was genuine. Hoskins was convinced and, seeing that Hurt&#x27;s guitar playing skills were still intact, encouraged him to move to Washington, D.C., and perform for a broader audience. Early in 1963 Hurt recorded an album, &quot;Folk Songs And Blues&quot;, that was released in August 1963 through Piedmont Records.

This added to the American folk music revival which was blooming at that time and inspired the search for and the rediscovery of many other bluesmen of Hurt&#x27;s era such as Son House, Skip James, Bukka White, Mance Lipscomb and Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins. Hurt performed on the festival, university and coffeehouse concert circuits with other Delta blues musicians who were brought out of retirement. His performances in 1963 at the Newport Folk Festival and the Philadelphia Folk Festival caused his star to rise. In 1964, he recorded live for radio station WTBS-FM In Cambridge, Massachusetts as did Skip James.

For three years, Hurt performed extensively at colleges, concert halls, and coffeehouses, appearing on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, on Pete Seeger&#x27;s public tv show, Rainbow Quest alongside Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee and Hedy West and had a write up in Time magazine. He also recorded three albums for Vanguard Records. Much of his repertoire was also recorded for the Library of Congress. His fans particularly liked the ragtime songs Salty Dog, Candy Man and the blues ballads Spike Driver Blues (a variant of John Henry) and Frankie.

Hurt&#x27;s influence spanned several music genres including blues, spirituals, country, bluegrass, folk, and contemporary rock and roll. A soft-spoken man, his nature reflected his work which was a mellow mix of country, blues, and old-time music.

Mississippi John Hurt made his last recordings at a hotel in New York City in February and July of that year though they were not released until 1972 on the Vanguard LP &quot;Last Sessions&quot;. He died of a heart attack on November 2, 1966 at a hospital in Grenada, Mississippi.

Several record labels recorded his songs. They&#x27;ve been covered by Bob Dylan, Dave Van Ronk, Jerry Garcia, Beck, Doc Watson, John McCutcheon, Taj Mahal, Bruce Cockburn, David Johansen, Bill Morrissey, Gillian Welch, The Be Good Tanyas, Josh Ritter, Chris Smither, Guthrie Thomas, Parsonsfield, and Rory Block among others.

==Style==
Hurt used a syncopated finger picking style of guitar playing that he taught himself. He was influenced by few other musicians, among them was Rufus Hanks, an elderly, unrecorded blues singer from the Avalon area who played twelve-string guitar and harmonica.

According to the music critic Robert Christgau, &quot;the school of John Fahey proceeded from his finger picking and while he&#x27;s not the only quietly conversational singer in the modern folk tradition, no one else has talked the blues with such delicacy or restraint.&quot;

==Tributes==
There was a memorial and museum dedicated to Hurt in Avalon, Mississippi, parallel to Rural Route 2, the rural road he grew up on. On February 20, 2024, it was destroyed in a fire the day after being made a National Landmark. Arson is not suspected.

The singer-songwriter Tom Paxton, who met Hurt and played on the same bill with him at the Gaslight in Greenwich Village around 1963, wrote and recorded a song about him in 1977, &quot;Did You Hear John Hurt?&quot;.

The first track of John Fahey&#x27;s 1968 solo acoustic guitar album &quot;Requia&quot; is &quot;Requiem for John Hurt&quot;. Fahey&#x27;s posthumous live album, &quot;The Great Santa Barbara Oil Slick&quot;, also features a version of the piece, entitled &quot;Requiem for Mississippi John Hurt&quot;.

Norman Greenbaum&#x27;s eclectic minor hit, &quot;Gondoliers, Shakespeares, Overseers, Playboys And Bums&quot; refers to Mississippi John Hurt singing the blues.

The British folk and blues artist Wizz Jones recorded a tribute song, &quot;Mississippi John&quot;, for his 1977 album &quot;Magical Flight&quot;.

The Delta blues artist Rory Block recorded the album &quot;Avalon: A Tribute to Mississippi John Hurt&quot;, released in 2013 as part of her &quot;Mentor Series&quot;.

The New England singer-songwriter Bill Morrissey released the Grammy-nominated album &quot;Songs of Mississippi John Hurt&quot; in 1999.

In 2017, Hurt&#x27;s life story was told in the documentary series &quot;American Epic&quot;. The film featured footage of Hurt performing and being interviewed, and improved restorations of his 1920s recordings. Director Bernard MacMahon stated that Hurt &quot;was the inspiration for &quot;American Epic&quot;&quot;. Hurt&#x27;s life was profiled in the accompanying book, &quot;American Epic: The First Time America Heard Itself&quot;.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Hurt at number 159 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

<text>Moravia ( ; ) is a historical region in the east of the Czech Republic and one of three historical Czech lands, with Bohemia and Czech Silesia.

The medieval and early modern Margraviate of Moravia was a crown land of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown from 1348 to 1918, an imperial state of the Holy Roman Empire from 1004 to 1806, a crown land of the Austrian Empire from 1804 to 1867, and a part of Austria-Hungary from 1867 to 1918. Moravia was one of the five lands of Czechoslovakia founded in 1918. In 1928 it was merged with Czech Silesia, and then dissolved in 1948 during the abolition of the land system following the communist coup d&#x27;état.

Its area of 22,623.41 km2 is home to about 3.0 million of the Czech Republic&#x27;s 10.9 million inhabitants. The people are historically named Moravians, a subgroup of Czechs, the other group being called Bohemians. The land takes its name from the Morava river, which runs from its north to south, being its principal watercourse. Moravia&#x27;s largest city and historical capital is Brno. Before being sacked by the Swedish army during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Olomouc served as the Moravian capital, and it is still the seat of the Archdiocese of Olomouc. Until the expulsions after 1945, significant parts of Moravia were German speaking.

== Toponymy ==
The region and former margraviate of Moravia, &quot;Morava&quot; in Czech, is named after its principal river Morava. It is theorized that the river&#x27;s name is derived from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*mori&quot;: &quot;waters&quot;, or indeed any word denoting &quot;water&quot; or a &quot;marsh&quot;.

The German name for Moravia is &quot;Mähren&quot;, from the river&#x27;s German name &quot;March&quot;. This could have a different etymology, as &quot;march&quot; is a term used in the Medieval times for an outlying territory, a border or a frontier (cf. English &quot;march&quot;). In Latin, the name Moravia was used.

==Geography==
Moravia occupies most of the eastern part of the Czech Republic. Moravian territory is naturally strongly determined, in fact, as the Morava river basin, with strong effect of mountains in the west (&quot;de facto&quot; main European continental divide) and partly in the east, where all the rivers rise.

Moravia occupies an exceptional position in Central Europe. All the highlands in the west and east of this part of Europe run west–east, and therefore form a kind of filter, making north–south or south–north movement more difficult. Only Moravia with the depression of the westernmost Outer Subcarpathia, wide, between the Bohemian Massif and the Outer Western Carpathians (gripping the meridian at a constant angle of 30°), provides a comfortable connection between the Danubian and Polish regions, and this area is thus of great importance in terms of the possible migration routes of large mammals – both as regards periodically recurring seasonal migrations triggered by climatic oscillations in the prehistory, when permanent settlement started.

Moravia borders Bohemia in the west, Lower Austria in the southwest, Slovakia in the southeast, Poland very shortly in the north, and Czech Silesia in the northeast. Its natural boundary is formed by the Sudetes mountains in the north, the Carpathians in the east and the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands in the west (the border runs from Králický Sněžník in the north, over Suchý vrch, across Upper Svratka Highlands and Javořice Highlands to tripoint nearby Slavonice in the south). The Thaya river meanders along the border with Austria and the tripoint of Moravia, Austria and Slovakia is at the confluence of the Thaya and Morava rivers. The northeast border with Silesia runs partly along the Moravice, Oder and Ostravice rivers. Between 1782 and 1850, Moravia (also thus known as &quot;Moravia-Silesia&quot;) also included a small portion of the former province of Silesia – the Austrian Silesia (when Frederick the Great annexed most of ancient Silesia (the land of upper and middle Oder river) to Prussia, Silesia&#x27;s southernmost part remained with the Habsburgs).

Today Moravia includes the South Moravian and Zlín regions, vast majority of the Olomouc Region, southeastern half of the Vysočina Region and parts of the Moravian-Silesian, Pardubice and South Bohemian regions.

Geologically, Moravia covers a transitive area between the Bohemian Massif and the Carpathians (from northwest to southeast), and between the Danube basin and the North European Plain (from south to northeast). Its core geomorphological features are three wide valleys, namely the Dyje-Svratka Valley (&quot;Dyjsko-svratecký úval&quot;), the Upper Morava Valley (&quot;Hornomoravský úval&quot;) and the Lower Morava Valley (&quot;Dolnomoravský úval&quot;). The first two form the westernmost part of the Outer Subcarpathia, the last is the northernmost part of the Vienna Basin. The valleys surround the low range of Central Moravian Carpathians. The highest mountains of Moravia are situated on its northern border in Hrubý Jeseník, the highest peak is Praděd (1491 m). Second highest is the massive of Králický Sněžník (1424  m) the third are the Moravian-Silesian Beskids at the very east, with Smrk (1278 m), and then south from here Javorníky (1072). The White Carpathians along the southeastern border rise up to 970 m at Velká Javořina. The spacious, but moderate Bohemian-Moravian Highlands on the west reach 837 m at Javořice.

The fluvial system of Moravia is very cohesive, as the region border is similar to the watershed of the Morava river, and thus almost the entire area is drained exclusively by a single stream. Morava&#x27;s far biggest tributaries are Thaya (Dyje) from the right (or west) and Bečva (east). Morava and Thaya meet at the southernmost and lowest (148 m) point of Moravia. Small peripheral parts of Moravia belong to the catchment area of Elbe, Váh and especially Oder (the northeast). The watershed line running along Moravia&#x27;s border from west to north and east is part of the European Watershed. For centuries, there have been plans to build a waterway across Moravia to join the Danube and Oder river systems, using the natural route through the Moravian Gate.

==History==
=== Pre-history ===

Evidence of the presence of members of the human genus, &quot;Homo&quot;, dates back more than 600,000 years in the paleontological area of Stránská skála.

Attracted by suitable living conditions, early modern humans settled in the region by the Paleolithic period. The Předmostí archeological (Cro-magnon) site in Moravia is dated to between 24,000 and 27,000 years old. Caves in Moravian Karst were used by mammoth hunters. Venus of Dolní Věstonice, the oldest ceramic figure in the world, was found in the excavation of Dolní Věstonice by Karel Absolon. In November 2024 a new discovery was made on the outskirts of Brno, where bones of at least three mammoths were found along with other animals and human stone tools dating back 15,000 years.

=== Bronze Age ===
During the Bronze Age, people of various cultures have settled in Moravia. Notably the Nitra culture which emerged from the tradition of the Neolithic Corded Ware culture and was spread in western Slovakia (hence the name, derived from Slovak river Nitra), eastern Moravia and southern Poland. The largest burial site (400 graves) of Nitra culture in Moravia was discovered in Holešov in 1960&#x27;s.
The most recent discovery unearthed 2 settlements and two burial grounds (with total 130 graves) near Olomouc, one of them of the Nitra culture dating between the years 2100-1800 BC and was published in October 2024. This discovery adds up to other Bronze Age discoveries such as a sword found near the city of Přerov, the sword was called ‘the Excalibur of the Late Bronze Age’.

===Roman era===
Around 60 BC, the Celtic Volcae people withdrew from the region and were succeeded by the Germanic Quadi. Some of the events of the Marcomannic Wars took place in Moravia in AD 169–180. After the war exposed the weakness of Rome&#x27;s northern frontier, half of the Roman legions (16 out of 33) were stationed along the Danube. In response to increasing numbers of Germanic settlers in frontier regions like Pannonia, Dacia, Rome established two new frontier provinces on the left shore of the Danube, Marcomannia and Sarmatia, including today&#x27;s Moravia and western Slovakia.

In the 2nd century AD, a Roman fortress stood on the vineyards hill known as and (&quot;hillfort&quot;), situated above the former village Mušov and above today&#x27;s beach resort at Pasohlávky. During the reign of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, the 10th Legion was assigned to control the Germanic tribes who had been defeated in the Marcomannic Wars. In 1927, the archeologist Gnirs, with the support of president Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, began research on the site, located 80 km from Vindobona and 22 km to the south of Brno. The researchers found remnants of two masonry buildings, a &quot;praetorium&quot; and a &quot;balneum&quot; (&quot;bath&quot;), including a &quot;hypocaustum&quot;. The discovery of bricks with the stamp of the Legio X Gemina and coins from the period of the emperors Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius and Commodus facilitated dating of the locality.

===Ancient Moravia===

A variety of Germanic and major Slavic tribes crossed through Moravia during the Migration Period before Slavs established themselves in the 6th century AD. At the end of the 8th century, the Moravian Principality came into being in present-day south-eastern Moravia, Záhorie in south-western Slovakia and parts of Lower Austria. In 833 AD, this became the state of Great Moravia with the conquest of the Principality of Nitra (present-day Slovakia). Their first king was Mojmír I (ruled 830–846). Louis the German invaded Moravia and replaced Mojmír I with his nephew Rastiz who became St. Rastislav. St. Rastislav (846–870) tried to emancipate his land from the Carolingian influence, so he sent envoys to Rome to get missionaries to come. When Rome refused he turned to Constantinople to the Byzantine emperor Michael. The result was the mission of Saints Cyril and Methodius who translated liturgical books into Slavonic, which had lately been elevated by the Pope to the same level as Latin and Greek. Methodius became the first Moravian archbishop, the first archbishop in Slavic world, but after his death the German influence again prevailed and the disciples of Methodius were forced to flee. Great Moravia reached its greatest territorial extent in the 890s under Svatopluk I. At this time, the empire encompassed the territory of the present-day Czech Republic and Slovakia, the western part of present Hungary (Pannonia), as well as Lusatia in present-day Germany and Silesia and the upper Vistula basin in southern Poland. After Svatopluk&#x27;s death in 895, the Bohemian princes defected to become vassals of the East Frankish ruler Arnulf of Carinthia, and the Moravian state ceased to exist after being overrun by invading Magyars in 907.

===Union with Bohemia===
Following the defeat of the Magyars by Emperor Otto I at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955, Otto&#x27;s ally Boleslaus I, the Přemyslid ruler of Bohemia, took control over Moravia. Bolesław I Chrobry of Poland annexed Moravia in 999, and ruled it until 1019, when the Přemyslid prince Bretislaus recaptured it. Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1034, Bretislaus became the ruler of Bohemia. In 1055, he decreed that Bohemia and Moravia would be inherited together by primogeniture, although he also provided that his younger sons should govern parts (quarters) of Moravia as vassals to his oldest son.

Throughout the Přemyslid era, junior princes often ruled all or part of Moravia from Olomouc, Brno or Znojmo, with varying degrees of autonomy from the ruler of Bohemia. Dukes of Olomouc often acted as the &quot;right hand&quot; of Prague dukes and kings, while Dukes of Brno and especially those of Znojmo were much more insubordinate. Moravia reached its height of autonomy in 1182, when Emperor Frederick I elevated Conrad II Otto of Znojmo to the status of a margrave, immediately subject to the emperor, independent of Bohemia. This status was short-lived: in 1186, Conrad Otto was forced to obey the supreme rule of Bohemian duke Frederick. Three years later, Conrad Otto succeeded to Frederick as Duke of Bohemia and subsequently canceled his margrave title. Nevertheless, the margrave title was restored in 1197 when Vladislaus III of Bohemia resolved the succession dispute between him and his brother Ottokar by abdicating from the Bohemian throne and accepting Moravia as a vassal land of Bohemian (i.e., Prague) rulers. Vladislaus gradually established this land as Margraviate, slightly administratively different from Bohemia. After the Battle of Legnica, the Mongols carried their raids into Moravia.

The main line of the Přemyslid dynasty became extinct in 1306, and in 1310 John of Luxembourg became Margrave of Moravia and King of Bohemia. In 1333, he made his son Charles the next Margrave of Moravia (later in 1346, Charles also became the King of Bohemia). In 1349, Charles gave Moravia to his younger brother John Henry who ruled in the margraviate until his death in 1375, after him Moravia was ruled by his oldest son Jobst of Moravia who was in 1410 elected the Holy Roman King but died in 1411 (he is buried with his father in the Church of St. Thomas in Brno – the Moravian capital from which they both ruled). Moravia and Bohemia remained within the Luxembourg dynasty of Holy Roman kings and emperors (except during the Hussite wars), until inherited by Albert II of Habsburg in 1437.

After his death followed the interregnum until 1453; land (as the rest of lands of the Bohemian Crown) was administered by the landfriedens (&quot;landfrýdy&quot;). The rule of young Ladislaus the Posthumous subsisted only less than five years and subsequently (1458) the Hussite George of Poděbrady was elected as the king. He again reunited all Czech lands (then Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, Upper &amp; Lower Lusatia) into one-man ruled state. In 1466, Pope Paul II excommunicated George and forbade all Catholics (i.e. about 15% of population) from continuing to serve him. The Hungarian crusade followed and in 1469 Matthias Corvinus conquered Moravia and proclaimed himself (with assistance of rebelling Bohemian nobility) as the king of Bohemia.

The subsequent 21-year period of a divided kingdom was decisive for the rising awareness of a specific Moravian identity, distinct from that of Bohemia. Although Moravia was reunited with Bohemia in 1490 when Vladislaus Jagiellon, king of Bohemia, also became king of Hungary, some attachment to Moravian &quot;freedoms&quot; and resistance to government by Prague continued until the end of independence in 1620. In 1526, Vladislaus&#x27; son Louis died in battle and the Habsburg Ferdinand I was elected as his successor.

=== Habsburg rule (1526–1918) ===

After the death of King Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia in 1526, Ferdinand I of Austria was elected King of Bohemia and thus ruler of the Crown of Bohemia (including Moravia). The epoch 1526–1620 was marked by increasing animosity between Catholic Habsburg kings (emperors) and the Protestant Moravian nobility (and other Crowns&#x27;) estates. Moravia, like Bohemia, was a Habsburg possession until the end of World War I. In 1573 the Jesuit University of Olomouc was established; this was the first university in Moravia. The establishment of a special papal seminary, Collegium Nordicum, made the University a centre of the Catholic Reformation and effort to revive Catholicism in Central and Northern Europe. The second largest group of students were from Scandinavia.

Brno and Olomouc served as Moravia&#x27;s capitals until 1641. As the only city to successfully resist the Swedish invasion, Brno become the sole capital following the capture of Olomouc. The Margraviate of Moravia had, from 1348 in Olomouc and Brno, its own Diet, or parliament, &quot;zemský sněm&quot; (&quot;Landtag&quot; in German), whose deputies from 1905 onward were elected separately from the ethnically separate German and Czech constituencies. The oldest surviving theatre building in Central Europe, the Reduta Theatre, was established in 17th-century Moravia. 

From 1599 to 1711, Moravia was frequently subjected to raids by the Ottoman Empire and its vassals (especially the Tatars and Transylvania). Overall, hundreds of thousands were enslaved whilst tens of thousands were killed. 

In 1740, Moravia was invaded by Prussian forces under Frederick the Great, and Olomouc was forced to surrender on 27 December 1741. A few months later the Prussians were repelled, mainly because of their unsuccessful siege of Brno in 1742. In 1758, Olomouc was besieged by Prussians again, but this time its defenders forced the Prussians to withdraw following the Battle of Domstadtl. In 1777, a new Moravian bishopric was established in Brno, and the Olomouc bishopric was elevated to an archbishopric. In 1782, the Margraviate of Moravia was merged with Austrian Silesia into &quot;Moravia-Silesia&quot;, with Brno as its capital. Moravia became a separate crown land of Austria again in 1849, and then became part of Cisleithanian Austria-Hungary after 1867. According to Austro-Hungarian census of 1910 the proportion of Czechs in the population of Moravia at the time (2.622.000) was 71.8%, while the proportion of Germans was 27.6%.

===20th century===

Following the break-up of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, Moravia became part of Czechoslovakia. As one of the five lands of Czechoslovakia, it had restricted autonomy. In 1928 Moravia ceased to exist as a territorial unity and was merged with Czech Silesia into the Moravian-Silesian Land (yet with the natural dominance of Moravia). By the Munich Agreement (1938), the southwestern and northern peripheries of Moravia, which had a German-speaking majority, were annexed by Nazi Germany, and during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia (1939–1945), the remnant of Moravia was an administrative unit within the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. 

During World War II, the Germans operated multiple forced labour camps in the region, including several subcamps of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp for Allied POWs, a subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp in Brno for mostly Polish prisoners, and a subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp in Bílá Voda for Jewish women. The occupiers also established several POW camps, including Heilag VIII-H, Oflag VIII-F and Oflag VIII-H, for French, British, Belgian and other Allied POWs in the region.

In 1945 after the Allied defeat of Germany and the end of World War II, the German minority was expelled to Germany and Austria in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The Moravian-Silesian Land was restored with Moravia as part of it and towns and villages that were left by the former German inhabitants, were re-settled by Czechs, Slovaks and reemigrants. In 1949 the territorial division of Czechoslovakia was radically changed, as the Moravian-Silesian Land was abolished and Lands were replaced by &quot;kraje&quot; (regions), whose borders substantially differ from the historical Bohemian-Moravian border, so Moravia politically ceased to exist after more than 1100 years (833–1949) of its history. Although another administrative reform in 1960 implemented (among others) the North Moravian and the South Moravian regions (&quot;Severomoravský&quot; and &quot;Jihomoravský kraj&quot;), with capitals in Ostrava and Brno respectively, their joint area was only roughly alike the historical state and, chiefly, there was no land or federal autonomy, unlike Slovakia.

After the fall of the Soviet Union and the whole Eastern Bloc, the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly condemned the cancellation of Moravian-Silesian land and expressed &quot;firm conviction that this injustice will be corrected&quot; in 1990. However, after the breakup of Czechoslovakia into Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993, Moravian area remained integral to the Czech territory, and the latest administrative division of Czech Republic (introduced in 2000) is similar to the administrative division of 1949. Nevertheless, the federalist or separatist movement in Moravia is completely marginal.

The centuries-lasting historical Bohemian-Moravian border has been preserved up to now only by the Czech Roman Catholic Administration, as the Ecclesiastical Province of Moravia corresponds with the former Moravian-Silesian Land. The popular perception of the Bohemian-Moravian border&#x27;s location is distorted by the memory of the 1960 regions (whose boundaries are still partly in use).

== Economy ==
An area in South Moravia, around Hodonín and Břeclav, is part of the Viennese Basin. Petroleum and lignite are found there in abundance. The main economic centres of Moravia are Brno, Olomouc, Zlín, and Ostrava lying directly on the Moravian–Silesian border. As well as agriculture in general, Moravia is noted for its viticulture; it contains 94% of the Czech Republic&#x27;s vineyards and is at the centre of the country&#x27;s wine industry. Wallachia has at least a 400-year-old tradition of slivovitz making.

The Czech automotive industry also played a significant role in Moravia&#x27;s economy in the 20th century; the factories of Wikov in Prostějov and Tatra in Kopřivnice produced many automobiles.

Moravia is also the centre of the Czech firearm industry, as the vast majority of Czech firearms manufacturers (e.g. CZUB, Zbrojovka Brno, Czech Small Arms, Czech Weapons, ZVI, Great Gun) are found in Moravia. Almost all the well-known Czech sporting, self-defence, military, and hunting firearms are made in Moravia. Meopta rifle scopes are of Moravian origin. The original Bren gun was conceived here, as were the assault rifles the CZ-805 BREN and Sa vz. 58, and the handguns CZ 75 and ZVI Kevin (also known as the &quot;Micro Desert Eagle&quot;).

The Zlín Region hosts several aircraft manufacturers, namely Let Kunovice (also known as Aircraft Industries, a.s.), ZLIN AIRCRAFT a.s. Otrokovice (formerly known under the name Moravan Otrokovice), Evektor-Aerotechnik, and Czech Sport Aircraft. Sport aircraft are also manufactured in Jihlava by Jihlavan Airplanes/Skyleader.

Aircraft production in the region started in the 1930s; after a period of low production post-1989, there have been signs of recovery post-2010, and production is expected to grow from 2013 onwards.

Companies with operations in Brno include Gen Digital, which maintains one of its headquarters there and continues to use the brand AVG Technologies, as well as Kyndryl (Client Innovation Centre), AT&amp;T, and Honeywell (Global Design Center). Other significant companies include Siemens, Red Hat (Czech headquarters), and an office of Zebra Technologies. 

In recent years, Brno&#x27;s economy has seen growth in the quaternary sector, focusing on science, research, and education. Notable projects include AdMaS (Advanced Materials, Structures, and Technologies) and CETOCOEN (Center for Research on Toxic Substances in the Environment).
=== Machinery industry ===
The machinery industry has been the most important industrial sector in the region, especially in South Moravia, for many decades. The main centres of machinery production are Brno (Zbrojovka Brno, Zetor, První brněnská strojírna, Siemens), Blansko (ČKD Blansko, Metra), Kuřim (TOS Kuřim), Boskovice (Minerva, Novibra) and Břeclav (Otis Elevator Company). A number of other, smaller machinery and machine parts factories, companies, and workshops are spread over Moravia.

=== Electrical industry ===
The beginnings of the electrical industry in Moravia date back to 1918. The biggest centres of electrical production are Brno (VUES, ZPA Brno, EM Brno), Drásov, Frenštát pod Radhoštěm, and Mohelnice (currently Siemens).

== People ==


The Moravians are generally a Slavic ethnic group who speak various (generally more archaic) dialects of Czech. Before the expulsion of Germans from Moravia the Moravian German minority also referred to themselves as &quot;Moravians&quot; (&quot;Mährer&quot;). Those expelled and their descendants continue to identify as Moravian.
 Some Moravians assert that Moravian is a language distinct from Czech; however, their position is not widely supported by academics and the public. Some Moravians identify as an ethnically distinct group; the majority consider themselves to be ethnically Czech. In the census of 1991 (the first census in history in which respondents were allowed to claim Moravian nationality), 1,362,000 (13.2%) of the Czech population identified as being of Moravian nationality (or ethnicity). In some parts of Moravia (mostly in the centre and south), majority of the population identified as Moravians, rather than Czechs. In the census of 2001, the number of Moravians had decreased to 380,000 (3.7% of the country&#x27;s population). In the census of 2011, this number rose to 522,474 (4.9% of the Czech population).

Moravia historically had a large minority of ethnic Germans, some of whom had arrived as early as the 13th century at the behest of the Přemyslid dynasty. Germans continued to come to Moravia in waves, culminating in the 18th century. They lived in the main city centres and in the countryside along the border with Austria (stretching up to Brno) and along the border with Silesia at Jeseníky, and also in two language islands, around Jihlava and around Moravská Třebová. After the World War II, the Czechoslovak government almost fully expelled them in retaliation for their support of Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion and dismemberment of Czechoslovakia (1938–1939) and subsequent German war crimes (1938–1945) towards the Czech, Moravian, and Jewish populations.

===Ethnographic regions===
Moravia can be divided on dialectal and lore basis into several ethnographic regions of comparable significance. In this sense, it is more heterogenous than Bohemia. Significant parts of Moravia, usually those formerly inhabited by the German speakers, are dialectally indifferent, as they have been resettled by people from various Czech (and Slovak) regions.

The principal cultural regions of Moravia are:

*Hanakia (&quot;Haná&quot;) in the central and northern part
*Lachia (&quot;Lašsko&quot;) in the northeastern tip
*Highlands (&quot;Horácko&quot;) in the west
*Moravian Slovakia (&quot;Slovácko&quot;) in the southeast
*Moravian Wallachia (&quot;Valašsko&quot;) in the east

<doc id="20217" wikidata="Q297079" url="?curid=20217" title="Murray Rothbard">
<text>Murray Newton Rothbard (; March 2, 1926 – January 7, 1995) was an American economist of the Austrian School, economic historian, political theorist, and activist. Rothbard was a central figure in the 20th-century American libertarian movement, particularly its right-wing strands, and was a founder and leading theoretician of anarcho-capitalism.(as termed by Rothbard; but later opposing the &#x27;anarchism&#x27; label on both etymological and historical grounds). He wrote over twenty books on political theory, history, economics, and other subjects.

Rothbard argued that all services provided by the &quot;monopoly system of the corporate state&quot; could be provided more efficiently by the private sector and wrote that the state is &quot;the organization of robbery systematized and writ large&quot;. He called fractional-reserve banking a form of fraud and opposed central banking. He categorically opposed all military, political, and economic interventionism in the affairs of other nations.

Rothbard led a &quot;fringe existence&quot; in academia, as described by his protégé Hans-Hermann Hoppe. Rothbard rejected mainstream economic methodologies and instead embraced the praxeology of Ludwig von Mises. Rothbard taught economics at a Wall Street division of New York University, later at Brooklyn Polytechnic, and after 1986 in an endowed position at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Partnering with the oil billionaire Charles Koch, Rothbard was a founder of the Cato Institute and the Center for Libertarian Studies in the 1970s. He broke with Cato and Koch, and in 1982 joined Lew Rockwell and Burton Blumert to establish the Mises Institute in Alabama.

Rothbard opposed egalitarianism and the civil rights movement, and blamed women&#x27;s voting and activism for the growth of the welfare state. He promoted historical revisionism and befriended the Holocaust denier Harry Elmer Barnes. Later in his career, Rothbard advocated a libertarian alliance with paleoconservatism (which he called paleolibertarianism), favoring right-wing populism and describing David Duke and Joseph McCarthy as models for political strategy. In the 2010s, he received renewed attention as an influence on the alt-right.

== Life and work ==
=== Education ===
Rothbard&#x27;s parents were David and Rae Rothbard, Jewish immigrants to the United States from Poland and Russia, respectively. David was a chemist. He attended Birch Wathen Lenox School, a private school in New York City. Rothbard later said he much preferred Birch Wathen to the &quot;debasing and egalitarian public school system&quot; he had attended in the Bronx.

Rothbard wrote of having grown up as a &quot;right-winger&quot; (adherent of the &quot;Old Right&quot;) among friends and neighbors who were &quot;communists or fellow-travelers&quot;. He was a member of the New York Young Republican Club in his youth. Rothbard described his father as an individualist who embraced minimal government, free enterprise, private property and &quot;a determination to rise by one&#x27;s own merits ... [A]ll socialism seemed to me monstrously coercive and abhorrent.&quot; In 1952, his father was trapped during a labor strike at the Tide Water Oil Refinery in New Jersey, which he managed, confirming their dislike of organized labor.
Rothbard attended Columbia University, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1945 and a PhD in economics in 1956. His first political activism came in 1948, on behalf of the segregationist South Carolinian Strom Thurmond&#x27;s presidential campaign. In the 1948 presidential election, Rothbard, &quot;as a Jewish student at Columbia, horrified his peers by organizing a Students for Strom Thurmond chapter, so staunchly did he believe in states&#x27; rights&quot;, according to &quot;The American Conservative&quot;. The delay in receiving his PhD was due in part to conflict with his advisor, Joseph Dorfman, and in part to Arthur Burns&#x27;s rejecting his dissertation. Burns was a longtime friend of the Rothbard family and their neighbor at their Manhattan apartment building. It was only after Burns went on leave from the Columbia faculty to head President Eisenhower&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers that Rothbard&#x27;s thesis was accepted, and he received his doctorate. Rothbard later said that all his fellow students were extreme leftists and that he was one of only two Republicans at Columbia at the time.

=== Marriage, Volker Fund, and academia ===
During the 1940s, Rothbard vetted articles for Leonard Read at the Foundation for Economic Education think tank, became acquainted with Frank Chodorov, and read widely in libertarian-oriented works by Albert Jay Nock, Garet Garrett, Isabel Paterson, H. L. Mencken, and Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises. Rothbard was greatly influenced by reading Mises&#x27;s book &quot;Human Action&quot; in 1949. In the 1950s, when Mises was teaching in the Wall Street division of the New York University Stern School of Business, Rothbard attended his unofficial seminar. Rothbard wanted to promote libertarian activism; by the mid-1950s, he helped form the Circle Bastiat, a libertarian and anarchist social group in New York City. He also joined the Mont Pelerin Society in the 1950s.

Rothbard attracted the attention of the William Volker Fund, a group that provided financial backing to promote right-wing ideologies in the 1950s and early 1960s. The Volker Fund paid Rothbard to write a textbook to explain &quot;Human Action&quot; in a form that could be used to introduce college undergraduates to Mises&#x27;s views; a sample chapter he wrote on money and credit won Mises&#x27;s approval. For ten years, the Volker Fund paid him a retainer as a &quot;senior analyst&quot;. As Rothbard continued his work, he enlarged the project. The result was his book &quot;Man, Economy, and State&quot;, published in 1962. Upon its publication, Mises praised Rothbard&#x27;s work effusively. In contrast to Mises, who considered security the primary justification for the state, Rothbard in the 1950s began to argue for a privatized market for the military, police and judiciary. Rothbard&#x27;s 1963 book &quot;America&#x27;s Great Depression&quot; blamed government policy failures for the Great Depression, and challenged the widely-held view that capitalism is unstable.

In 1953, Rothbard married JoAnn Beatrice Schumacher (1928–1999), whom he called Joey, in New York City. She was a historian, Rothbard&#x27;s personal editor, and a close adviser as well as hostess of his Rothbard Salon. They enjoyed a loving marriage, and Rothbard often called her &quot;the indispensable framework&quot; of his life and achievements. According to her, the Volker Fund&#x27;s patronage allowed Rothbard to work from home as a freelance theorist and pundit for the first 15 years of their marriage.

The Volker Fund collapsed in 1962, leading Rothbard to seek employment at various New York academic institutions. He was offered a part-time position teaching economics to engineering students at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in 1966 at age 40. The institution had no economics department or economics majors, and Rothbard derided its social science department as &quot;Marxist&quot;. Justin Raimondo, his biographer, writes that Rothbard liked teaching at Brooklyn Polytechnic because working only two days a week gave him the freedom to contribute to developments in libertarian politics. Rothbard continued in this role until 1986. Then 60 years old, Rothbard left Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute for the Lee Business School at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), where he held the title of S.J. Hall Distinguished Professor of Economics, a chair endowed by a libertarian businessman.

According to Rothbard&#x27;s friend, colleague, and fellow Misesian economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Rothbard led a &quot;fringe existence&quot; in academia, but he was able to attract a large number of &quot;students and disciples&quot; through his writings, thereby becoming &quot;the creator and one of the principal agents of the contemporary libertarian movement&quot;. Libertarian economist Jeffrey Herbener, who called Rothbard his friend and &quot;intellectual mentor&quot;, said in a memoriam that Rothbard received &quot;only ostracism&quot; from mainstream academia. Rothbard kept his position at UNLV from 1986 until his death.

=== Old Right ===
Throughout his life, Rothbard engaged in a number of different political movements to promote Old Right and libertarian political principles. George Hawley writes that &quot;unfortunately for Rothbard, the Old Right was ending as an intellectual and political force just as he was maturing as an intellectual&quot;, with the militantly anticommunist conservative movement exemplified by William F. Buckley Jr. supplanting the Old Right&#x27;s isolationism.

Rothbard was an admirer of Senator Joseph McCarthy—not for McCarthy&#x27;s Cold War views, but for his demagoguery, which Rothbard credited for disrupting the establishment consensus of what Rothbard called &quot;corporate liberalism&quot;. Rothbard contributed many articles to Buckley&#x27;s &quot;National Review&quot;, but his relations with Buckley and the magazine soured as he criticized the conservative movement for militarism. Specifically, Rothbard opposed how such militarism could justify and expand the state&#x27;s power.

Rothbard befriended the Holocaust denier Harry Elmer Barnes in 1959. In a 1966 issue of Robert LeFevre&#x27;s &quot;Rampart Journal of Individualist Thought&quot; devoted to historical revisionism, Rothbard argued that Western democracies had been to blame for starting World War I, World War II, and the Cold War. Rothbard published works by Barnes in his journals before and after Barnes died in 1968, including posthumously in the Cato Institute&#x27;s journal.

=== Conflict with Ayn Rand ===
In 1954, Rothbard, along with several other attendees of Mises&#x27;s seminar, joined the circle of novelist Ayn Rand, the founder of Objectivism. He soon parted from her, writing, among other things, that her ideas were not as original as she proclaimed but similar to those of Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and Herbert Spencer. In 1958, after the publication of Rand&#x27;s novel &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, Rothbard wrote her a &quot;fan letter&quot;, calling the book &quot;an infinite treasure house&quot; and &quot;not merely the greatest novel ever written, [but] one of the very greatest books ever written, fiction or nonfiction.&quot; He also wrote: &quot;[Y]ou introduced me to the whole field of natural rights and natural law philosophy,&quot; prompting him to learn &quot;the glorious natural rights tradition.&quot; Rothbard rejoined Rand&#x27;s circle for a few months but soon broke with Rand again over various differences, including his defense of his interpretation of anarchism.

Rothbard later satirized Rand&#x27;s acolytes in his unpublished one-act farce &quot;Mozart Was a Red&quot; and his essay &quot;The Sociology of the Ayn Rand Cult&quot;. He characterized Rand&#x27;s circle as a &quot;dogmatic, personality cult&quot;. His play parodies Rand (through the character Carson Sand) and her friends and is set during a visit from Keith Hackley, a fan of Sand&#x27;s novel &quot;The Brow of Zeus&quot; (a play on &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;).

=== New Left outreach ===
By the late 1960s, according to &quot;The American Conservative&quot;, Rothbard&#x27;s &quot;long and winding yet somehow consistent road had taken him from anti-New Deal and anti-interventionist Robert A. Taft supporter into friendship with the quasi-pacifist Nebraska Republican Congressman Howard Buffett (father of Warren Buffett) then over to the League of (Adlai) Stevensonian Democrats and, by 1968, into tentative comradeship with the anarchist factions of the New Left.&quot; Rothbard joined the Peace and Freedom Party and contributed writing to the New Left journal &quot;Ramparts&quot;.

Rothbard later criticized the New Left for supporting a &quot;People&#x27;s Republic&quot;-style Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays . It was during this phase that he associated with Karl Hess (a former Barry Goldwater speechwriter who had rejected conservatism) and founded &quot;Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought&quot; with Leonard Liggio and George Resch. Raimondo described Rothbard during this time as &quot;a man of the Old Culture: he believed that it was possible to be a revolutionary, an anarchist, &quot;and&quot; lead a bourgeois life&quot;, and wrote that the &quot;respectably dressed, if a bit rumpled&quot; Rothbard was &quot;immune to the blandishments of sixties youth culture&quot;. During this time, Rothbard proposed that black Americans should embrace racial separatism and secession. He was frustrated that blacks and whites in the New Left instead decided to work together for egalitarian goals. In the 1970s, Rothbard turned sharply against the left and described equality as evil.

=== Libertarianism and Cato Institute ===
From 1969 to 1984, Rothbard edited &quot;The Libertarian Forum&quot;, also initially with Hess (although Hess&#x27;s involvement ended in 1971). Despite its small readership, it engaged conservatives associated with the &quot;National Review&quot; in nationwide debate. Rothbard rejected the view that Ronald Reagan&#x27;s 1980 presidential election was a victory for libertarian principles, and he attacked Reagan&#x27;s economic program in a series of &quot;Libertarian Forum&quot; articles. In 1982, Rothbard called Reagan&#x27;s claims of spending cuts a &quot;fraud&quot; and a &quot;hoax&quot; and accused Reaganites of doctoring the economic statistics to give a false impression that their policies successfully reduced inflation and unemployment. He further criticized the &quot;myths of Reaganomics&quot; in 1987.

Rothbard criticized the &quot;frenzied nihilism&quot; of left-wing libertarians but also criticized right-wing libertarians who were content to rely only on education to bring down the state; he believed that libertarians should adopt any moral tactic available to them to bring about liberty. Imbibing Randolph Bourne&#x27;s idea that &quot;war is the health of the state&quot;, Rothbard opposed all wars in his lifetime and engaged in anti-war activism.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Rothbard was active in the Libertarian Party. He was frequently involved in the party&#x27;s internal politics. Rothbard founded the Center for Libertarian Studies in 1976 and the &quot;Journal of Libertarian Studies&quot; in 1977. He was one of the founders of the Cato Institute in 1977 (whose funding by Charles Koch was a major infusion of money for libertarianism) and &quot;came up with the idea of naming this libertarian think tank after &quot;Cato&#x27;s Letters&quot;, a powerful series of British newspaper essays by John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon which played a decisive influence upon America&#x27;s Founding Fathers in fomenting the Revolution&quot;.

From 1978 to 1983, Rothbard was associated with the Libertarian Party Radical Caucus, allying himself with Justin Raimondo, Eric Garris and Williamson Evers. He opposed the &quot;low-tax liberalism&quot; espoused by 1980 Libertarian Party presidential candidate Ed Clark and Cato Institute president Edward H Crane III. According to Charles Burris, &quot;Rothbard and Crane became bitter rivals after disputes emerging from the 1980 LP presidential campaign of Ed Clark carried over to strategic direction and management of Cato&quot;.

Janek Wasserman wrote, &quot;The tempestuous tale of the Rothbard-Koch-Cato relationship has been told and retold because of its floridness.&quot; Rothbard sought to cultivate radical anarcho-capitalists, while Crane and Koch wanted a more reformist approach to influence government and gain political power. Rothbard was removed from Cato&#x27;s board in 1981. Wasserman described the split as &quot;the first of many examples of Austrian and libertarian schisms in the United States&quot;.

=== Mises Institute ===
In 1982, following his split with the Cato Institute, Rothbard co-founded the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama, (with Lew Rockwell and Burton Blumert) and was vice president of academic affairs until 1995. Rothbard also founded the institute&#x27;s &quot;Review of Austrian Economics&quot;, a heterodox economics journal later renamed the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics&quot;, in 1987. Rothbard &quot;worked closely with Lew Rockwell (joined later by his long-time friend Blumert) in nurturing the Mises Institute and the publication, &quot;The Rothbard-Rockwell Report&quot;; which after Rothbard&#x27;s 1995 death evolved into the website, &quot;LewRockwell.com&quot;&quot;, according to the website.

Rothbard and other Mises Institute scholars criticized libertarian groups funded by the Koch brothers, referring to them as the &quot;Kochtopus&quot;. In contrast to some other libertarian groups, the Mises Institute &quot;pushed more politically marginal positions like the virtues of secession, the need for a return to the gold standard, and opposition to racial integration&quot;, according to historian Quinn Slobodian. Rothbard split with the Radical Caucus at the 1983 national convention over cultural issues and aligned himself with what he called the &quot;right-wing populist&quot; wing of the party, notably Lew Rockwell and Ron Paul, who ran for president on the Libertarian Party ticket in 1988.

=== Paleolibertarianism ===

In 1989, Rothbard left the Libertarian Party and began building bridges to the post-Cold War anti-interventionist right, calling himself a paleolibertarian, a conservative reaction against the cultural liberalism of mainstream libertarianism. Paleolibertarianism sought to appeal to disaffected working-class whites through a synthesis of cultural conservatism and libertarian economics. According to &quot;Reason&quot;, Rothbard advocated right-wing populism in part because he was frustrated that mainstream thinkers were not adopting the libertarian view and suggested that former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke, as well as Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy, were models for an &quot;Outreach to the Rednecks&quot; effort that a broad libertarian/paleoconservative coalition could use. Working together, the coalition would expose the &quot;unholy alliance of &#x27;corporate liberal&#x27; Big Business and media elites, who, through big government, have privileged and caused to rise up a parasitic Underclass&quot;. Rothbard blamed this &quot;underclass&quot; for &quot;looting and oppressing the bulk of the middle and working classes in America&quot;. Regarding Duke&#x27;s political program, Rothbard asserted that there was &quot;nothing&quot; in it that &quot;could not also be embraced by paleoconservatives or paleolibertarians; lower taxes, dismantling the bureaucracy, slashing the welfare system, attacking affirmative action and racial set-asides, calling for equal rights for all Americans, including whites&quot;. He also praised the &quot;racialist science&quot; in Charles Murray&#x27;s controversial book &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;.

Rothbard co-founded and became a key figure in the John Randolph Club, which was an alliance between the Mises Institute and the paleoconservative Rockford Institute. He supported the presidential campaign of Pat Buchanan in 1992, writing that &quot;with Pat Buchanan as our leader, we shall break the clock of social democracy&quot;. When Buchanan dropped out of the Republican primary race, Rothbard then shifted his interest and support to Ross Perot, who Rothbard wrote had &quot;brought an excitement, a verve, a sense of dynamics and of open possibilities to what had threatened to be a dreary race&quot;. Rothbard eventually withdrew his support from Perot, and endorsed George H. W. Bush in the 1992 election. Like Buchanan, Rothbard opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); however, he had become disillusioned with Buchanan by 1995, believing that the latter&#x27;s &quot;commitment to protectionism was mutating into an all-round faith in economic planning and the nation state&quot;.

=== Personal life ===
Joey Rothbard said in a memoriam that her husband had a happy and bright spirit and that Rothbard, a night owl, &quot;managed to make a living for 40 years without having to get up before noon. This was important to him.&quot; She said Rothbard would begin every day with a phone conversation with his colleague Lew Rockwell: &quot;Gales of laughter would shake the house or apartment, as they checked in with each other. Murray thought it was the best possible way to start a day&quot;.

Rothbard was irreligious and agnostic about God, describing himself as a &quot;mixture of an agnostic and a Reform Jew&quot;. Despite identifying as an agnostic and an atheist, he was critical of the &quot;left-libertarian hostility to religion&quot;. In Rothbard&#x27;s later years, many of his friends anticipated that he would convert to Catholicism, but he never did.

=== Death ===
Rothbard died of a heart attack on January 7, 1995, in St. Luke&#x27;s-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan, at the age of 68. &quot;The New York Times&quot; obituary called Rothbard &quot;an economist and social philosopher who fiercely defended individual freedom against government intervention&quot;. Lew Rockwell, president of the Mises Institute, told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Rothbard was &quot;the founder of right-wing anarchism&quot;. William F. Buckley Jr. wrote a critical obituary in the &quot;National Review&quot;, criticizing Rothbard&#x27;s &quot;defective judgment&quot; and views on the Cold War. Hoppe, Rockwell, and Rothbard&#x27;s other colleagues at the Mises Institute took a different view, arguing that he was one of the most important philosophers in history.

== Views ==
=== Austrian economics ===

Rothbard was an advocate and practitioner of the Austrian School tradition of his teacher Ludwig von Mises. Like Mises, Rothbard rejected the application of the scientific method to economics and dismissed econometrics, empirical and statistical analysis, and other tools of mainstream social science as outside the field (economic history might use those tools, but not Economics proper). He instead embraced praxeology, the strictly &quot;a priori&quot; methodology of Mises. Praxeology conceives of economic laws as akin to geometric or mathematical axioms: fixed, unchanging, objective, and discernible through logical reasoning.

According to Misesian economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe, eschewing the scientific method and empiricism distinguishes the Misesian approach &quot;from all other current economic schools&quot;, which dismiss the Misesian approach as &quot;dogmatic and unscientific.&quot; Mark Skousen of Chapman University and the Foundation for Economic Education, a critic of mainstream economics, praises Rothbard as brilliant, his writing style persuasive, his economic arguments nuanced and logically rigorous and his Misesian methodology sound. But Skousen concedes that Rothbard was effectively &quot;outside the discipline&quot; of mainstream economics and that his work &quot;fell on deaf ears&quot; outside his ideological circles. Rothbard wrote extensively on Austrian business cycle theory and, as part of this approach, strongly opposed central banking, fiat money, and fractional-reserve banking, advocating a gold standard and a 100% reserve requirement for banks.

==== Polemics against mainstream economics ====
Rothbard wrote a series of polemics in which he deprecated a number of leading modern economists. He vilified Adam Smith, calling him a &quot;shameless plagiarist&quot; who set economics off track, ultimately leading to the rise of Marxism. Rothbard praised Smith&#x27;s contemporaries, including Richard Cantillon, Anne Robert Jacques Turgot and Étienne Bonnot de Condillac, for developing the subjective theory of value. In response to Rothbard&#x27;s charge that Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; was largely plagiarized, David D. Friedman castigated Rothbard&#x27;s scholarship and character, saying that he &quot;was [either] deliberately dishonest or never really read the book he was criticizing&quot;. Tony Endres called Rothbard&#x27;s treatment of Smith a &quot;travesty&quot;.

Rothbard was equally scathing in his criticism of John Maynard Keynes, calling him weak on economic theory and a shallow political opportunist. Rothbard also wrote more generally that Keynesian-style governmental regulation of money and credit created a &quot;dismal monetary and banking situation&quot;. He called John Stuart Mill a &quot;wooly man of mush&quot; and speculated that Mill&#x27;s &quot;soft&quot; personality led his economic thought astray. Rothbard was critical of monetarist economist Milton Friedman. In his polemic &quot;Milton Friedman Unraveled&quot;, he called Friedman a &quot;statist&quot;, a &quot;favorite of the establishment&quot;, a friend of and an &quot;apologist&quot; for Richard Nixon, and a &quot;pernicious influence&quot; on public policy. Rothbard said that libertarians should scorn rather than celebrate Friedman&#x27;s academic prestige and political influence. Noting that Rothbard has &quot;been nasty to me and my work&quot;, Friedman responded to Rothbard&#x27;s criticism by calling him a &quot;cult builder and a dogmatist&quot;.

In a memorial volume published by the Mises Institute, Rothbard&#x27;s protégé and libertarian theorist Hans-Hermann Hoppe wrote that &quot;Man, Economy, and State&quot; &quot;presented a blistering refutation of all variants of mathematical economics&quot; and included it among Rothbard&#x27;s &quot;almost mind-boggling achievements&quot;. Hoppe lamented that, like Mises, Rothbard died without winning the Nobel Prize and, while acknowledging that Rothbard and his work were largely ignored by academia, called him an &quot;intellectual giant&quot; comparable to Aristotle, John Locke, and Immanuel Kant.

====Disputes with other Austrian economists====
Georgetown Professor Randy Barnett says, regarding Rothbard&#x27;s &quot;insistence on complete ideological purity&quot;, that &quot;[a]lmost every intellectual who entered his orbit was eventually spun off, or self emancipated, for some deviation or another. For this reason, the circle around Rothbard was always small.&quot; Although he self-identified as an Austrian economist, Rothbard&#x27;s methodology was at odds with that of many other Austrians. In 1956, Rothbard deprecated the views of Austrian economist Fritz Machlup, stating that Machlup was no praxeologist and calling him instead a &quot;positivist&quot; who failed to represent the views of Ludwig von Mises. Rothbard noted that, in fact, Machlup shared the opposing positivist view associated with economist Milton Friedman. Mises and Machlup had been colleagues in 1920s Vienna before each relocated to the United States, and Mises later urged his American protege Israel Kirzner to pursue his PhD studies with Machlup at Johns Hopkins University.

According to libertarian economists Tyler Cowen and Richard Fink, Rothbard wrote that the term &quot;evenly rotating economy&quot; (ERE) could be used to analyze complexity in a world of change. Mises introduced ERE as an alternative nomenclature for the mainstream economic method of static equilibrium and general equilibrium analysis. Cowen and Fink found &quot;serious inconsistencies in both the nature of the ERE and its suggested uses&quot;. With the sole exception of Rothbard, no other economist adopted Mises&#x27; term, and the concept continued to be called &quot;equilibrium analysis&quot;.

In a 2011 article critical of Rothbard&#x27;s &quot;reflexive opposition&quot; to inflation, &quot;The Economist&quot; noted that his views were increasingly gaining influence among politicians and laypeople on the right. The article contrasted Rothbard&#x27;s categorical rejection of inflationary policies with the monetary views of &quot;sophisticated Austrian-school monetary economists such as George Selgin and Lawrence H. White&quot;, [who] follow Hayek in treating stability of nominal spending as a monetary ideal—a position &quot;not all that different from Mr [Scott] Sumner&#x27;s&quot;. According to economist Peter Boettke, Rothbard is better described as a property rights economist than as an Austrian economist. In 1988, Boettke noted that Rothbard &quot;vehemently attacked all of the books of the younger Austrians&quot;.

=== Ethics ===

Although Rothbard adopted Ludwig von Mises&#x27; deductive methodology for his social theory and economics, he parted with Mises on the question of ethics. Specifically, he rejected Mises&#x27; conviction that ethical values remain subjective and opposed utilitarianism in favor of principle-based, natural law reasoning. In defense of his free-market views, Mises employed utilitarian economic arguments to contend that interventionist policies worsened society. Rothbard countered that interventionist policies do, in fact, benefit some people, including certain government employees and beneficiaries of social programs. Therefore, unlike Mises, Rothbard argued for an objective, natural-law basis for the free market. He called this principle &quot;self-ownership&quot;, loosely basing the idea on the writings of John Locke and also borrowing concepts from classical liberalism and the anti-imperialism of the Old Right.

Rothbard accepted the labor theory of property but rejected the Lockean proviso, arguing that if an individual mixes his labor with unowned land, then he becomes the proper owner eternally and that after that time, it is private property which may change hands only by trade or gift. Rothbard was a strong critic of egalitarianism. The title essay of Rothbard&#x27;s 1974 book &quot;Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays&quot; held: &quot;Equality is not in the natural order of things, and the crusade to make everyone equal in every respect (except before the law) is certain to have disastrous consequences.&quot; In it, Rothbard wrote: &quot;At the heart of the egalitarian left is the pathological belief that there is no structure of reality; that all the world is a tabula rasa that can be changed at any moment in any desired direction by the mere exercise of human will.&quot; Noam Chomsky critiqued Rothbard&#x27;s ideal society as &quot;a world so full of hate that no human being would want to live in it... First of all, it couldn&#x27;t function for a second—and if it could, all you&#x27;d want to do is get out, or commit suicide or something.&quot;

=== Anarcho-capitalism ===
According to anarcho-capitalists, various theorists have espoused legal philosophies similar to anarcho-capitalism; however, Rothbard was credited with coining the terms &quot;anarcho-capitalist&quot; and &quot;anarch-capitalism&quot; in 1971 (though &quot;anarchocapitalism [sic]&quot; had been attested earliest in Karl Hess&#x27;s 1969 essay &quot;The Death of Politics&quot;). He synthesized elements from the Austrian School of economics, classical liberalism and 19th-century American individualist anarchists into a right-wing form of anarchism. According to his protégé Hans-Hermann Hoppe, &quot;[t]here would be no anarcho-capitalist movement to speak of without Rothbard&quot;. Lew Rockwell in a memoriam called Rothbard the &quot;conscience&quot; of all the various strains of what he described as &quot;libertarian anarchism&quot;, and said their advocates had often been personally inspired by his example.

During his years at graduate school in the late 1940s, Rothbard considered whether strict adherence to libertarian and &quot;laissez-faire&quot; principles required the abolition of the state altogether. He visited Baldy Harper, a founder of the Foundation for Economic Education, who doubted the need for any government whatsoever. Rothbard said that during this period, he was influenced by 19th-century American individualist anarchists like Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker and the Belgian economist Gustave de Molinari who wrote about how such a system could work. Thus, he &quot;combined the &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economics of Mises with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state&quot; from individualist anarchists. Edward Stringham opined that: &quot;In the late 1940s, Murray Rothbard decided that that [sic] private-property anarchism was the logical conclusion of free-market thinking [...].&quot;

Rothbard began to consider himself a &quot;private property anarchist&quot; and published works about private property anarchism in 1954; later, in 1971, he began to use &quot;anarcho-capitalist&quot; to describe his political ideology. In his anarcho-capitalist model, the system of private property is upheld by private firms, such as hypothesized protection agencies, which compete in a free market and are voluntarily supported by consumers who choose to use their protective and judicial services. Anarcho-capitalists describe this as &quot;the end of the state monopoly on force&quot;. In this way, Rothbard differed from Mises, who favored a state to uphold markets.

In an unpublished article, Rothbard wrote that economically speaking, individualist anarchism differs from anarcho-capitalism and jokingly pondered whether libertarians should adopt the term nonarchist. Rothbard concluded the article by affirming that he is neither an anarchist nor an &quot;artist&quot; but a middle-of-the-roader on the archy question. In &quot;Man, Economy, and State&quot;, Rothbard divides the various kinds of state intervention into three categories: &quot;autistic intervention&quot; (interference with private non-economic activities), &quot;binary intervention&quot;, (exchange between individuals and the state); and &quot;triangular intervention&quot; (state-mandated exchange between individuals). Sanford Ikeda wrote that Rothbard&#x27;s typology &quot;eliminates the gaps and inconsistencies that appear in Mises&#x27;s original formulation&quot;. Rothbard writes in &quot;Power and Market&quot; that the role of the economist in a free market is limited, but it is much larger in a government that solicits economic policy recommendations. Rothbard argues that self-interest, therefore, prejudices the views of many economists in favor of increased government intervention.

=== Race, gender, and civil rights ===
Michael O&#x27;Malley, associate professor of history at George Mason University, describes Rothbard&#x27;s tone toward the civil rights movement and the women&#x27;s suffrage movement as &quot;contemptuous and hostile&quot;. Rothbard criticized women&#x27;s rights activists, attributing the growth of the welfare state to politically active spinsters &quot;whose busybody inclinations were not fettered by the responsibilities of home and hearth&quot;. Rothbard argued that the progressive movement, which he regarded as a noxious influence on the United States, was spearheaded by a coalition of Yankee Protestants (people from the six New England states and upstate New York who were Protestants of English descent), Jewish women and &quot;lesbian spinsters&quot;.

Rothbard called for the elimination of &quot;the entire &#x27;civil rights&#x27; structure,&quot; which he said &quot;tramples on the property rights of every American.&quot; He consistently favored repeal of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, including Title VII regarding employment discrimination, and called for overturning the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision on the grounds that state-mandated integration of schools violated libertarian principles. In an essay called &quot;Right-wing Populism&quot;, Rothbard proposed a set of measures to &quot;reach out&quot; to the &quot;middle and working classes&quot;, which included urging the police to crack down on &quot;street criminals&quot;, writing that &quot;cops must be unleashed&quot; and &quot;allowed to administer instant punishment, subject of course to liability when they are in error&quot;. He also advocated that the police &quot;clear the streets of bums and vagrants.&quot;

Rothbard held strong opinions about many leaders of the civil rights movement. He considered black separatist Malcolm X to be a &quot;great black leader&quot; and integrationist Martin Luther King Jr. to be favored by whites because he &quot;was the major restraining force on the developing Negro revolution&quot;. Jacob Jensen writes that Rothbard&#x27;s commentary from the 1960s, approving of both &quot;black power&quot; and &quot;white power&quot; in separated communities, amounted to support for racial segregation. In 1993, Rothbard rejected the vision of a &quot;separate black nation&quot;, asking, &quot;Does anyone really believe that ... New Africa would be content to strike out on its own, with no massive &quot;foreign aid&quot; from the U.S.A.?&quot;. Rothbard also suggested that opposition to Martin Luther King Jr., whom he demeaned as a &quot;coercive integrationist&quot;, should be a litmus test for members of his &quot;paleolibertarian&quot; political movement.

Rothbard is described by the historian John P. Jackson Jr. as espousing antisemitism despite Rothbard&#x27;s own background as a secular Jew. One former student described Rothbard as privately using the anti-Jewish slur &quot;kikes&quot; repeatedly. Rothbard also befriended the Holocaust deniers Willis Carto and Harry Elmer Barnes.

=== Views on war ===
Like Randolph Bourne, Rothbard believed that &quot;war is the health of the state&quot;. According to David Gordon, this was the reason for Rothbard&#x27;s opposition to aggressive foreign policy. Rothbard believed that stopping new wars was necessary and that knowing how the government had led citizens into earlier wars was important. Two essays expanded on these views: &quot;War, Peace, and the State&quot; and &quot;Anatomy of the State&quot;. Rothbard used insights from Vilfredo Pareto, Gaetano Mosca, and Robert Michels to build a model of state personnel, goals, and ideology.

Rothbard&#x27;s colleague Joseph Stromberg notes that Rothbard made two exceptions to his general condemnation of war: &quot;the American Revolution and the War for Southern Independence, as viewed from the Confederate side&quot;, referring to the American Civil War. Rothbard condemned the &quot;Northern war against slavery&quot;, saying it was inspired by &quot;fanatical&quot; religious faith and characterized by &quot;a cheerful willingness to uproot institutions, to commit mayhem and mass murder, to plunder and loot and destroy, all in the name of high moral principle&quot;. He celebrated Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, and other prominent Confederates as heroes while denouncing Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and other Union leaders, who he said had &quot;opened the Pandora&#x27;s Box of genocide and the extermination of civilians&quot;. Rothbard saw secession movements as a tool for undermining and disintegrating the state, according to historian Quinn Slobodian, who wrote that &quot;Rothbard&#x27;s life was marked by a search for signs of potential secession&quot; and that &quot;When he found them, he did his best to deepen them.&quot;

=== Historical revisionism ===
Rothbard embraced &quot;historical revisionism&quot; as an antidote to what he perceived to be the dominant influence exerted by corrupt &quot;court intellectuals&quot; over mainstream historical narratives. His friend Harry Elmer Barnes, the Holocaust-denying historian, used similar language, &quot;court historians&quot;. Rothbard wrote that these mainstream intellectuals distorted the historical record in favor of &quot;the state&quot; in exchange for &quot;wealth, power, and prestige&quot; from the state. Rothbard characterized the revisionist task as &quot;penetrating the fog of lies and deception of the State and its Court Intellectuals, and to present to the public the true history&quot;.

Rothbard worked with antisemitic writers in developing an isolationist revisionist history of World War II. He was influenced by and called a champion of Barnes. Rothbard favorably cited Barnes&#x27; view that &quot;the murder of Germans and Japanese was the overriding aim of World War II&quot;. In an obituary for Barnes, Rothbard wrote: &quot;Our entry into World War II was the crucial act in foisting a permanent militarization upon the economy and society, in bringing to the country a permanent garrison state, an overweening military–industrial complex, a permanent system of conscription. It was the crucial act in creating a mixed economy run by Big Government, a system of state monopoly capitalism run by the central government in collaboration with Big Business and Big Unionism.&quot; Besides broadly supporting his historical views, Rothbard promoted Barnes as an influence for future revisionists.

Rothbard&#x27;s endorsement of World War II revisionism and his association with Barnes and other Holocaust deniers have drawn criticism. Kevin D. Williamson wrote an opinion piece published by &quot;National Review&quot; which condemned Rothbard for &quot;making common cause with the &#x27;revisionist&#x27; historians of the Third Reich&quot;, a term he used to describe American Holocaust deniers associated with Rothbard, such as James J. Martin of the Institute for Historical Review. The piece also characterized &quot;Rothbard and his faction&quot; as being &quot;culpably indulgent&quot; of Holocaust denial, the view which &quot;specifically denies that the Holocaust actually happened or holds that it was in some way exaggerated&quot;. In an article for Rothbard&#x27;s 50th birthday, Rothbard&#x27;s friend and Buffalo State College historian Ralph Raico stated that Rothbard &quot;is the main reason that revisionism has become a crucial part of the whole libertarian position&quot;.

=== Middle East conflict ===
Rothbard&#x27;s &quot;The Libertarian Forum&quot; blamed the Middle East conflict on Israeli aggression &quot;fueled by American arms and money&quot;. Rothbard warned that the Middle East conflict would draw the United States into a world war. He was anti-Zionist and opposed United States involvement in the Middle East. Rothbard said the Camp David Accords betrayed Palestinian aspirations and opposed Israel&#x27;s 1982 invasion of Lebanon.

In his essay, &quot;War Guilt in the Middle East&quot;, Rothbard wrote that Israel refused &quot;to let these refugees return and reclaim the property taken from them,&quot; and took negative views of a two state solution for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. He wrote: &quot;On the one hand there are the Palestinian Arabs, who have tilled the soil or otherwise used the land of Palestine for centuries; and on the other, there are a group of external fanatics, who come from all over the world, and who claim the entire land area as &#x27;given&#x27; to them as a collective religion or tribe at some remote or legendary time in the past. There is no way the two claims can be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties. There can be no genuine settlement, no &#x27;peace&#x27; in the face of this irrepressible conflict; there can only be either a war to the death, or an uneasy practical compromise which can satisfy no one.&quot;

=== Children&#x27;s rights and parental obligations ===
In the &quot;Ethics of Liberty&quot;, Rothbard explores issues regarding children&#x27;s rights regarding self-ownership and contract. These include support for a woman&#x27;s right to abortion, condemnation of parents showing aggression towards children and opposition to the state forcing parents to care for children. He also holds children have the right to run away from parents and seek new guardians as soon as they are able to choose to do so. He argued that parents have the right to put a child out for adoption or sell the rights to the child in a voluntary contract in what Rothbard suggests will be a &quot;flourishing free market in children&quot;. He believes that selling children as consumer goods in accord with market forces—while &quot;superficially monstrous&quot;—will benefit &quot;everyone&quot; involved in the market: &quot;the natural parents, the children, and the foster parents purchasing&quot;.

In Rothbard&#x27;s view of parenthood, &quot;the parent should not have a legal obligation to feed, clothe, or educate his children, since such obligations would entail positive acts coerced upon the parent and depriving the parent of his rights.&quot; Thus, Rothbard stated that parents should have the legal right to let any infant die by starvation and should be free to engage in other forms of child neglect. However, according to Rothbard, &quot;the purely free society will have a flourishing free market in children&quot;. In a fully libertarian society, he wrote, &quot;the existence of a free baby market will bring such &#x27;neglect&#x27; down to a minimum&quot;. Economist Gene Callahan of Cardiff University, formerly a scholar at the Rothbard-affiliated Mises Institute, wrote that Rothbard allowed &quot;the logical elegance of his legal theory&quot; to &quot;trump any arguments based on the moral reprehensibility of a parent idly watching her six-month-old child slowly starve to death in its crib&quot;.

=== Retributive theory of criminal justice ===
In &quot;The Ethics of Liberty&quot;, Rothbard advocates for a &quot;frankly retributive theory of punishment&quot; or a system of &quot;a tooth (or two teeth) for a tooth&quot;. Rothbard emphasizes that all punishment must be proportional, stating that &quot;the criminal, or invader, loses his rights to the extent that he deprived another man of his&quot;. Applying his retributive theory, Rothbard states that a thief &quot;must pay double the extent of theft&quot;. Rothbard gives the example of a thief who stole $15,000 and says he would have to return the stolen money and provide the victim an additional $15,000, money to which the thief has forfeited his right. The thief would be &quot;put in a [temporary] state of enslavement to his victim&quot; if he is unable to pay him immediately. Rothbard also applies his theory to justify beating and torturing violent criminals, although the beatings are required to be proportional to the crimes for which they are being punished.

==== Torture of criminal suspects ====
In chapter twelve of &quot;Ethics&quot;, Rothbard turns his attention to suspects arrested by the police. He argues that police should be able to torture certain types of criminal suspects, including accused murderers, for information related to their alleged crimes. Writes Rothbard: &quot;Suppose ... police beat and torture a suspected murderer to find information (not to wring a confession, since obviously a coerced confession could never be considered valid). If the suspect turns out to be guilty, then the police should be exonerated, for then they have only ladled out to the murderer a parcel of what he deserves in return; his rights had already been forfeited by more than that extent. But if the suspect is not convicted, then that means that the police have beaten and tortured an innocent man, and that they in turn must be put into the dock for criminal assault&quot;. Gene Callahan examines this position and concludes that Rothbard rejects the widely held belief that torture is inherently wrong, no matter who the victim. Callahan goes on to state that Rothbard&#x27;s scheme gives the police a strong motive to frame the suspect after having tortured him or her.

=== Science and scientism ===
In an essay condemning &quot;scientism in the study of man&quot;, Rothbard rejected the application of causal determinism to human beings, arguing that the actions of human beings—as opposed to those of everything else in nature—are not determined by prior causes, but by &quot;free will&quot;. He argued that &quot;determinism as applied to man, is a self-contradictory thesis, since the man who employs it relies implicitly on the existence of free will&quot;. Rothbard opposed what he considered the overspecialization of the academy and sought to fuse the disciplines of economics, history, ethics and political science to create a &quot;science of liberty&quot;. Rothbard described the moral basis for his anarcho-capitalist position in two of his books: &quot;For a New Liberty&quot;, published in 1973; and &quot;The Ethics of Liberty&quot;, published in 1982. In his &quot;Power and Market&quot; (1970), Rothbard describes how a stateless economy might function.

<doc id="20218" wikidata="Q104266" url="?curid=20218" title="Mel Brooks">
<text>Melvin James Brooks (; born June 28, 1926) is an American actor, comedian, filmmaker, and songwriter. With a career spanning over seven decades, he is known as a writer and director of a variety of successful broad farces and parodies. A recipient of numerous accolades, he is one of 21 entertainers to win the EGOT, which includes an Emmy Award, a Grammy Award, an Academy Award, and a Tony Award. He received a Kennedy Center Honor in 2009, a Hollywood Walk of Fame star in 2010, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2013, a British Film Institute Fellowship in 2015, a National Medal of Arts in 2016, a BAFTA Fellowship in 2017, and the Honorary Academy Award in 2024.

Brooks began his career as a comic and a writer for Sid Caesar&#x27;s variety show &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; from 1950 to 1954. With Carl Reiner, he created the comedy sketch &quot;The 2000 Year Old Man&quot;, and together, they released several comedy albums, starting with &quot;2000 Year Old Man&quot; in 1960. With Buck Henry, he created the hit television comedy series &quot;Get Smart&quot;, which starred Don Adams and ran from 1965 to 1970.

Brooks won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for &quot;The Producers&quot; (1967). He then rose to prominence becoming one of the most successful film directors of the 1970s with &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot; (1970), &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; (1974), &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; (1974), &quot;Silent Movie&quot; (1976), and &quot;High Anxiety&quot; (1977). Later Brooks made &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot; (1981), &quot;Spaceballs&quot; (1987), &quot;Life Stinks&quot; (1991), &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot; (1993), and &quot;&quot; (1995). A musical adaptation of his first film, &quot;The Producers&quot;, ran on Broadway from 2001 to 2007 and earned Brooks three Tony Awards. The project was remade into a musical film in 2005. He wrote and produced the Hulu series &quot;History of the World, Part II&quot; (2023).

Brooks was married to actress Anne Bancroft from 1964 until her death in 2005. Their son Max Brooks is an actor and author, known for his novel &quot;World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War&quot; (2006). In 2021, Mel Brooks published his memoir titled &quot;All About Me!&quot;. Three of his films are included on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of the top 100 comedy films of the past 100 years (1900–2000), all of which were ranked in the top 15: &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; at number 6, &quot;The Producers&quot; at number 11, and &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; at number 13.

== Early life and education ==
Brooks was born Melvin James Kaminsky&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk/a6759956&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; on a tenement kitchen table on June 28, 1926, in Brownsville, Brooklyn, to Kate (&quot;née&quot; Brookman) and Max Kaminsky, and grew up in Williamsburg. His father&#x27;s family were German Jews from Danzig (Gdańsk, Poland); his mother was a Ukrainian Jewish immigrant from Kyiv, in the Pale of Settlement of the Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine). He had three older brothers: Irving, Lenny, and Bernie. His father died of tuberculosis of the kidney at 34 when Brooks was two years old. He has said of his father&#x27;s death, &quot;There&#x27;s an outrage there. I may be angry at God, or at the world, for that. And I&#x27;m sure a lot of my comedy is based on anger and hostility. Growing up in Williamsburg, I learned to clothe it in comedy to spare myself problems—like a punch in the face.&quot;

Brooks was a small, sickly boy who often was bullied and teased by his classmates because of his size.&lt;ref name=&quot;brookslyn/Adelina1980/Brooks&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At age nine, he saw &quot;Anything Goes&quot; with William Gaxton, Ethel Merman and Victor Moore at the Alvin Theater.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn/mel-brooks-qa&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After the show, he told his uncle that he was not going to work in the garment district like everyone else but instead wanted to go into show business.

When Brooks was 14 he gained employment as a pool-side tummler (entertainer) at the Butler Lodge, a second-rate Borscht Belt hotel, where he met 18-year-old Sid Caesar. Brooks kept his guests amused with his crazy antics. In a &quot;Playboy&quot; interview, he explained that one day he stood at the edge of a diving board wearing a derby and a large alpaca overcoat with two suitcases full of rocks, and then announced: &quot;Business is terrible! I can&#x27;t go on!&quot; before jumping, fully clothed into the pool.&lt;ref name=&quot;nydailynews/brooks-book-20190331&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He was taught by Buddy Rich (who had also grown up in Williamsburg) how to play the drums, and started to earn money as a musician when he was 14. During his time as a drummer, he was given his first opportunity as a comedian at the age of 16, filling in for an ill MC. During his teens, he changed his name to Melvin Brooks,&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian/2021/dec/04/mel-brooks&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; influenced by his mother&#x27;s maiden name Brookman, after being confused with trumpeter Max Kaminsky. Brooks graduated from Eastern District High School in Williamsburg in January 1944&lt;ref name=&quot;americanfilm/2013/6/cover&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and intended to follow his older brother and enroll in Brooklyn College to study psychology.

===1944–1946: World War II service===
In early 1944, in his senior year in high school, Brooks was recruited to take the Army General Classification Test, a Stanford–Binet-type IQ test.&lt;ref name=&quot;historynet/mel-brooks&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He made high scores and was sent to the Army Specialized Training Program at the Virginia Military Institute to be taught electrical engineering, horse riding, and saber fighting.&lt;ref name=&quot;defense.gov/2882521&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, Brooks was drafted into the Army. Twelve weeks later, when he turned 18, he officially joined the United States Army at the Fort Dix, New Jersey, induction center, and was sent to the Field Artillery Replacement Training Center at Fort Sill, Oklahoma for basic training and radio operator training. Brooks was then sent back to Fort Dix for overseas assignment. Brooks says he boarded at the Brooklyn Navy Yard around February 15, 1945. A reporter for the United States Department of Defense writes that Brooks arrived in France in November 1944, and later in Belgium, serving with the 78th Infantry Division as a forward artillery observer. In December 1944, a short while later, Brooks was transferred to the 1104th Engineer Combat Battalion as a combat engineer, participating in the Battle of the Bulge. Of his experience there, Brooks noted:

Along the roadside, you&#x27;d see bodies wrapped up in mattress covers and stacked in a ditch, and those would be Americans, that could be me. I sang all the time ... I never wanted to think about it ... Death is the enemy of everyone, and even though you hate Nazis, death is more of an enemy than a German soldier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Variety/Christon/Producers&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Stationed in Saarbrücken and Baumholder, the battalion was responsible for clearing booby-trapped buildings and defusing land mines as the Allies advanced into Nazi Germany. Brooks was tasked with land mine location; defusing was done by a specialist. Brooks has stated that when he heard Germans singing over loudspeakers, he responded by singing American-Jewish singer Al Jolson&#x27;s hit &quot;Toot, Toot, Tootsie (Goo&#x27; Bye!)&quot; into a bullhorn.&lt;ref name=&quot;military.com/veteran-brooks&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks spent time in the stockade after taking an anti-Semitic heckler&#x27;s helmet off and smashing him in the head with his mess kit.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbsnews/brooks-anti-semitism&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His unit constructed the first Bailey bridge over the Roer River, later building bridges over the Rhine river. In April 1945, Brooks&#x27;s unit conducted its last reconnaissance missions in the Harz mountains, Germany.

With the end of the war in Europe, Brooks joined the Special Services as a comic touring Army bases and he was made acting corporal, put in charge of entertainment at Wiesbaden, and performed at Fort Dix.&lt;ref name=&quot;1975/brooks-playboy&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1946, Brooks was honorably discharged from the Army as a corporal.

== Career ==
=== 1949–1959: Early work and breakthrough ===

After the war, Brooks&#x27;s mother had secured him a job as a clerk at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, but Brooks &quot;got into a taxi and ordered the driver to take him to the Catskills&quot;, where he started working in various Borscht Belt resorts and nightclubs in the Catskill Mountains as a drummer and pianist. When a regular comic at one of the clubs was too sick to perform, Brooks started working as a stand-up comic, telling jokes and doing movie-star impressions. He also began acting in summer stock in Red Bank, New Jersey, and did some radio work. He eventually worked his way up to the comically aggressive job of tummler at Grossinger&#x27;s, one of the Borscht Belt&#x27;s most famous resorts.

In the years after the war, Brooks&#x27;s hero was comedian Sid Caesar. Back in New York, Brooks would slink&lt;ref name=&quot;thecjn.ca/brooks&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; around trying to catch Caesar in between meetings to pitch him joke ideas. Eventually Caesar cracked and paid Brooks a little cash to throw him gags...At 24, Brooks got his break as a full-time writer.

Brooks found more rewarding work behind the scenes, becoming a comedy writer for television. In 1949, his friend Sid Caesar hired him to write jokes for the DuMont/NBC series &quot;The Admiral Broadway Revue&quot;, paying him, off-the-books, $50 a week. In 1950, Caesar created the innovative variety comedy series &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; and hired Brooks as a writer along with Carl Reiner, Neil Simon, Danny Simon, and head writer Mel Tolkin. The writing staff proved widely influential. Reiner, as creator of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, based Morey Amsterdam&#x27;s character Buddy Sorell on Brooks. Likewise, the film &quot;My Favorite Year&quot; (1982) is loosely based on Brooks&#x27;s experiences as a writer on the show including an encounter with the actor Errol Flynn. Neil Simon&#x27;s play &quot;Laughter on the 23rd Floor&quot; (1993) is also loosely based on the production of the show, and the character Ira Stone is based on Brooks. &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; ended in 1954 when performer Imogene Coca left to host her own show.

Caesar then created &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hour&quot; with most of the same cast and writers (including Brooks and adding Woody Allen and Larry Gelbart). It ran from 1954 until 1957. Brooks told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;When I was a fledgling comedy writer working for Sid Caesar on &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;, our head writer was Mel Tolkin... I really looked up to him. (By the way, I was 5-foot-7 and he was six feet tall.) He was a bona fide intellectual, thoroughly steeped in the traditions of great Russian literature. One day he handed me a book. He said to me, &#x27;Mel, you&#x27;re an animal from Brooklyn, but I think you have the beginnings of something called a mind.&#x27; The book was &quot;Dead Souls&quot; by the magnificent genius Nikolai Gogol. It was a revelation. I&#x27;d never read anything like it. It was hysterically funny and incredibly moving at the same time... It was a life-changing gift, and I still read it once a year to remind myself of what great comic writing can be.&quot;

=== 1958–1969: Rise to prominence ===

Brooks and co-writer Reiner had become close friends and began to casually improvise comedy routines when they were not working. In October 1959, for a Random House book launch of Moss Hart″s autobiography, &quot;Act One&quot;, at &quot;Mamma Leone&#x27;s&quot;, Mel Tolkin (standing in for Carl Reiner) and Mel Brooks performed, and it was later recalled by Kenneth Tynan.&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorker/1978/10/30/mel-brooks&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Reiner played the straight-man interviewer and set Brooks up as anything from a Tibetan monk to an astronaut. As Reiner explained: &quot;In the evening, we&#x27;d go to a party and I&#x27;d pick a character for him to play. I never told him what it was going to be.&quot; On one of these occasions, Reiner&#x27;s suggestion concerned a 2000-year-old man who had witnessed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ (who &quot;came in the store but never bought anything&quot;), had been married several hundred times and had &quot;over forty-two thousand children, and not one comes to visit me&quot;. At first Brooks and Reiner only performed the routine for friends but, by the late 1950s, it gained a reputation in New York City. Kenneth Tynan saw the comedy duo perform at a party in 1959 and wrote that Brooks &quot;was the most original comic improvisor I had ever seen&quot;.

In 1960, Brooks, without his family, moved from New York to Hollywood, returning in 1961. He and Reiner began performing the &quot;2000 Year Old Man&quot; act on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;. Their performances led to the release of the comedy album &quot;2000 Years with Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks&quot; that sold over a million copies in 1961. They eventually expanded their routine with two more albums in 1961 and 1962, a revival in 1973, a 1975 animated TV special, and a reunion album in 1998. At one point, when Brooks had financial and career struggles, the record sales from the 2000 Year Old Man were his chief source of income. Brooks adapted the 2000 Year Old Man character to create the 2500-Year-Old Brewmaster for Ballantine Beer in the 1960s. Interviewed by Dick Cavett in a series of ads, the Brewmaster (in a German accent, as opposed to the 2000 Year Old Man&#x27;s Yiddish accent) said he was inside the original Trojan horse and &quot;could&#x27;ve used a six-pack of fresh air&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;1966/brooks-playboy&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks was involved in the creation of the Broadway musical &quot;All American&quot; which debuted on Broadway in 1962. He wrote the play with lyrics by Lee Adams and music by Charles Strouse. It starred Ray Bolger as a southern science professor at a large university who uses the principles of engineering on the college&#x27;s football team and the team begins to win games. It was directed by Joshua Logan, who script-doctored the second act and added a gay subtext to the plot. It ran for 80 performances and received two Tony Award nominations. The animated short film &quot;The Critic&quot; (1963), a satire of arty, esoteric cinema, was conceived by Brooks and directed by Ernest Pintoff. Brooks supplied running commentary as the baffled moviegoer trying to make sense of the obscure visuals. It won the Academy Award for Animated Short Film.

With comedy writer Buck Henry, Brooks created a TV comedy show titled &quot;Get Smart,&quot; about a bumbling James Bond–inspired spy. Brooks said, &quot;I was sick of looking at all those nice sensible situation comedies. They were such distortions of life... I wanted to do a crazy, unreal comic-strip kind of thing about something besides a family. No one had ever done a show about an idiot before. I decided to be the first.&quot; Starring Don Adams as Maxwell Smart, Agent 86, the series ran from 1965 until 1970, although Brooks had little involvement after the first season. It was highly rated for most of its production and won seven Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series in 1968 and 1969.

During a press conference for &quot;All American&quot;, a reporter asked, &quot;What are you going to do next?&quot; and Brooks replied, &quot;Springtime for Hitler,&quot; perhaps riffing on &quot;Springtime for Henry&quot;. For several years, Brooks toyed with a bizarre and unconventional idea about a musical comedy of Adolf Hitler. He explored the idea as a novel and a play before finally writing a script. He eventually found two producers to fund it, Joseph E. Levine and Sidney Glazier, and made his first feature film, &quot;The Producers&quot; (1968).

&quot;The Producers&quot; was so brazen in its satire that major studios would not touch it, nor would many exhibitors. Brooks finally found an independent distributor who released it as an art film, a specialized attraction. At the 41st Academy Awards, Brooks won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film over fellow writers Stanley Kubrick and John Cassavetes. &quot;The Producers&quot; became a smash underground hit, first on the nationwide college circuit, then in revivals and on home video. It premiered to a limited audience in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on November 22, 1967, before achieving a wide release in 1968. Peter Sellers personally championed the film, paying out of pocket to take out full page ads in &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Brooks, along with his collaborator Thomas Meehan, later adapted it into a musical, which was hugely successful on Broadway and received an unprecedented 12 Tony awards. In 2000, Roger Ebert included &quot;The Producers&quot; in his canon of Great Movies, and remembered being in an elevator with Brooks and Anne Bancroft shortly after the movie was released: &quot;A woman got on the elevator, recognized him and said, &#x27;I have to tell you, Mr. Brooks, that your movie is vulgar.&#x27; Brooks smiled benevolently. &#x27;Lady&#x27;, he said, &#x27;it rose below vulgarity.

=== 1970–1979: Career stardom ===
With the moderate financial success of the film &quot;The Producers&quot;, Glazier financed Brooks&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot; (1970). Loosely based on Ilf and Petrov&#x27;s 1928 Russian novel of the same name about greedy materialism in post-revolutionary Russia, it stars Ron Moody, Frank Langella and Dom DeLuise as three men individually searching for a fortune in diamonds hidden in a set of 12 antique chairs. Brooks makes a cameo appearance as an alcoholic ex-serf who &quot;yearns for the regular beatings of yesteryear&quot;. The film was shot in Yugoslavia with a budget of $1.5 million. It received poor reviews and was not financially successful.

Brooks then wrote an adaptation of Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot;, but was unable to sell the idea to any studio and believed that his career was over. In 1972, he met agent David Begelman, who helped him set up a deal with Warner Bros. to hire Brooks (as well as Richard Pryor, Andrew Bergman, Norman Steinberg, and Alan Uger) as a script doctor for an unproduced script called &quot;Tex-X&quot;. Eventually, Brooks was hired as director for what became &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; (1974), his third film. &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; starred Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, Harvey Korman, Slim Pickens, Madeline Kahn, Alex Karras, and Brooks himself, with cameos by Dom DeLuise and Count Basie. It had music by Brooks and John Morris, and a modest budget of $2.6 million. A satire on the Western film genre, it references older films such as &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot; (1939), &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; (1948), &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952) and &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; (1968). In a surreal sequence towards the end, it references the extravagant musicals of Busby Berkeley.

Despite mixed reviews, &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; was a success with younger audiences. It became the second-highest US grossing film of 1974, grossing $119.5 million in the United States and Canada. It was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Madeline Kahn, Best Film Editing, and Best Music, Original Song. It won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen; and in 2006 it was deemed &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. Brooks has said that the film &quot;has to do with love more than anything else. I mean when that black guy rides into that Old Western town and even a little old lady says &#x27;Up yours, nigger!&#x27;, you know that his heart is broken. So it&#x27;s really the story of that heart being mended.&quot; Brooks described the film as &quot;a Jewish western with a black hero&quot;.

When Gene Wilder replaced Gig Young as the Waco Kid, he did so only when Brooks agreed that his next film would be a script&lt;ref name=&quot;vulture/funny-man-highlights&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; that Wilder had been working on: a spoof of the Universal series of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; films from several decades earlier. After the filming of &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; was completed, Wilder and Brooks began writing the script for &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; and shot it in the spring of 1974. It starred Wilder, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Teri Garr, Madeline Kahn, Cloris Leachman and Kenneth Mars, with Gene Hackman in a cameo role. Brooks&#x27; voice can be heard three times: as the wolf howl when the characters are on their way to the castle; as the voice of Victor Frankenstein, when the characters discover the laboratory; and as the sound of a cat when Gene Wilder accidentally throws a dart out of the window in a scene with Kenneth Mars. Composer John Morris again provided the score, and Universal monsters special effects veteran Kenneth Strickfaden worked on the film.
&quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; was the third-highest-grossing film domestically of 1974, just behind &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; with a gross of $86 million. It also received two Academy Award nominations for Adapted Screenplay and Best Sound. It received some of the best reviews of Brooks&#x27;s career. Even notoriously hard-to-please critic Pauline Kael liked it, saying: &quot;Brooks makes a leap up as a director because, although the comedy doesn&#x27;t build, he carries the story through ... [He] even has a satisfying windup, which makes this just about the only comedy of recent years that doesn&#x27;t collapse.&quot; In 1975, at the height of his movie career, Brooks tried TV again with &quot;When Things Were Rotten&quot;, a Robin Hood parody that lasted only 13 episodes. Nearly 20 years later, in response to the 1991 hit film &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;, Brooks mounted another Robin Hood parody, &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot; (1993). It resurrected several pieces of dialogue from his TV series, and from earlier Brooks films.

After his two hit films Brooks got a call from Ron Clark who had an audacious idea: the first feature-length silent comedy in four decades. &quot;Silent Movie&quot; (1976) was written by Brooks and Clark, and starred Brooks in his first leading role, with Dom DeLuise, Marty Feldman, Sid Caesar, Bernadette Peters, and in cameo roles playing themselves: Paul Newman, Burt Reynolds, James Caan, Liza Minnelli, Anne Bancroft, and the mime Marcel Marceau, who uttered the film&#x27;s only word of audible dialogue: &quot;Non!&quot; It is an homage to silent comedians Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, among others. It was not as successful as Brooks&#x27;s previous two films but did gross $36 million. Later that year, he was named fifth on the Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll. Reviews were generally favorable; Roger Ebert praised it as &quot;not only funny, but fun. It&#x27;s clear at almost every moment that the filmmakers had a ball making it.&quot; Regarding the film&#x27;s inside jokes, Ebert wrote that &quot;the thing about Brooks&#x27;s inside jokes is that their outsides are funny, too.&quot;

&quot;High Anxiety&quot; (1977), Brooks&#x27;s parody of Freudian psychoanalysis, as well as the films of Alfred Hitchcock, was written by Brooks, Ron Clark, Rudy De Luca, and Barry Levinson, and was the first movie Brooks produced himself. Starring Brooks, Madeline Kahn, Cloris Leachman, Harvey Korman, Ron Carey, Howard Morris, and Dick Van Patten, it satirizes such Hitchcock films as &quot;Vertigo&quot;, &quot;Spellbound&quot;, &quot;Psycho&quot;, &quot;The Birds&quot;, &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; and &quot;Suspicion&quot;. Brooks plays Professor Richard H. (Harpo) Thorndyke, a Nobel Prize–winning psychologist who suffers from &quot;high anxiety&quot;.

=== 1980–2001: Established career ===
By 1980, Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert had referred to Mel Brooks and Woody Allen as &quot;the two most successful comedy directors in the world today ... America&#x27;s two funniest filmmakers&quot;. Released that year was the dramatic film &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; directed by David Lynch and produced by Brooks. Knowing that anyone seeing a poster reading &quot;Mel Brooks presents &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;&quot; would expect a comedy, he set up the company Brooksfilms. It has since produced a number of non-comedy films, including &quot;Frances&quot; (1982), &quot;The Fly&quot; (1986), and &quot;84 Charing Cross Road&quot; (1987) starring Anthony Hopkins and Anne Bancroft—as well as comedies, including Richard Benjamin&#x27;s &quot;My Favorite Year&quot; (1982), partially based on Mel Brooks&#x27;s real life. Brooks sought to purchase the rights to &quot;84 Charing Cross Road&quot; for his wife, Anne Bancroft, for many years. He also produced the comedy &quot;Fatso&quot; (1980) that Bancroft directed.

In 1981, Brooks joked that the only genres that he hadn&#x27;t spoofed were historical epics and Biblical spectacles. &quot;History of the World Part I&quot; was a tongue-in-cheek look at human culture from the Dawn of Man to the French Revolution. Written, produced and directed by Brooks, with narration by Orson Welles, it was another modest financial hit, earning $31 million. It received mixed critical reviews. Critic Pauline Kael, who for years had been critical of Brooks, said, &quot;Either you get stuck thinking about the bad taste or you let yourself laugh at the obscenity in the humor as you do Buñuel&#x27;s perverse dirty jokes.&quot;

Brooks produced and starred in (but did not write or direct) a remake of Ernst Lubitsch&#x27;s 1942 film &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot;. His 1983 version was directed by Alan Johnson and starred Brooks, Anne Bancroft, Charles Durning, Tim Matheson, Jose Ferrer and Christopher Lloyd. It generated international publicity by featuring a controversial song on its soundtrack—&quot;To Be or Not to Be (The Hitler Rap)&quot;—satirizing German society in the 1940s, with Brooks playing Hitler.

The second movie Brooks directed in the 1980s was &quot;Spaceballs&quot; (1987), a parody of science fiction, mainly &quot;Star Wars&quot;. It starred Bill Pullman, John Candy, Rick Moranis, Daphne Zuniga, Dick Van Patten, Joan Rivers, Dom DeLuise, and Brooks.

In 1989, Brooks (with co-executive producer Alan Spencer) made another attempt at television success with the sitcom &quot;The Nutt House&quot;, featuring Brooks regulars Harvey Korman and Cloris Leachman. It was originally broadcast on NBC, but the network aired only five of the eleven produced episodes before canceling the series. During the next decade, Brooks directed &quot;Life Stinks&quot; (1991), &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot; (1993), and &quot;&quot; (1995). &quot;People&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;Anyone in a mood for a hearty laugh couldn&#x27;t do better than &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot;, which gave fans a parody of Robin Hood, especially &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;.&quot; Like Brooks&#x27;s other films, it is filled with one-liners and the occasional breaking of the fourth wall. &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot; was Brooks&#x27;s second time exploring the life of Robin Hood (the first, as mentioned above, being his 1975 TV show &quot;When Things Were Rotten&quot;). &quot;Life Stinks&quot; was a financial and critical failure, but is notable as the only film Brooks directed that is neither a parody nor a film about other films or theater. (&quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot; was a parody of the original novel.)

=== 2001–present ===
Brooks created the musical adaptation of his film &quot;The Producers&quot; on the Broadway in 2001. The production starring Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick received critical acclaim and was a significant box office success. &quot;The New York Times&quot; theatre critic Ben Brantley praised the production writing, &quot;Mr. Brooks has taken what could have been overblown camp into a far warmer realm in which affection always outweighs irony.&quot; The production broke the Tony Award record with 12 wins, a record previously held for 37 years by &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; with 10 wins including the Tony Award for Best Musical. It led to a 2005 big-screen version of the Broadway adaptation/remake with Lane, Broderick, Gary Beach, and Roger Bart reprising their stage roles, and new cast members Uma Thurman and Will Ferrell.

In early April 2006, Brooks began composing the score to a Broadway musical adaptation of &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;, which he says is &quot;perhaps the best movie [he] ever made&quot;. The world premiere was at Seattle&#x27;s Paramount Theater, between August 7, 2007, and September 1, 2007, after which it opened on Broadway at the former Lyric Theater (then the Hilton Theatre), New York, on October 11, 2007. It earned mixed reviews from the critics. In the 2000s, Brooks worked on an animated series sequel to &quot;Spaceballs&quot; called &quot;&quot;, which premiered on September 21, 2008, on G4 TV.

Brooks has also supplied vocal roles for animation. He voiced Bigweld, the master inventor, in the animated film &quot;Robots&quot; (2005), and in the later animated film &quot;Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman&quot; (2014) he had a cameo appearance as Albert Einstein. He returned, to voice Dracula&#x27;s father, Vlad, in &quot;Hotel Transylvania 2&quot; (2015) and &quot;Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation&quot; (2018). Brooks joked about the concept of a musical adaptation of &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; in the final number in &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;, in which the full company sings, &quot;next year, &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;!&quot; In 2010, Brooks confirmed this, saying that the musical could be finished within a year; however, no creative team or plan has been announced.

In 2021, at age 95, Brooks published a memoir titled &quot;All About Me!&quot;. On October 18, 2021, it was announced that Brooks would write and produce &quot;History of the World, Part II&quot;, a follow-up TV series on Hulu to his 1981 movie. He received a nomination for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Character Voice-Over Performance for his role as the narrator in the series.

== Acting credits and accolades ==

Brooks is one of the few people who have received an Oscar, an Emmy, a Tony, and a Grammy. He won his first Grammy for Best Spoken Comedy Album in 1999 for his recording of &quot;The 2000 Year Old Man in the Year 2000&quot; with Carl Reiner. His two other Grammys came in 2002 for Best Musical Show Album for the cast album of &quot;The Producers&quot; and for Best Long Form Music Video for the DVD &quot;Recording the Producers: A Musical Romp with Mel Brooks&quot;. He won his first of four Emmy awards in 1967 for Outstanding Writing Achievement in Variety for a Sid Caesar special, and won Emmys in 1997, 1998, and 1999 for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his role of Uncle Phil on &quot;Mad About You&quot;. He won his Academy Award for Original Screenplay (Oscar) in 1968 for &quot;The Producers&quot;. He won his three Tony awards in 2001 for his work on the musical &quot;The Producers&quot;, for Best Musical, Best Original Musical Score, and Best Book of a Musical.

Brooks also won a Hugo Award and Nebula Award for &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;. In a 2005 poll by Channel 4 to find &quot;The Comedian&#x27;s Comedian&quot;, he was voted No. 50 of the top 50 comedy acts ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders. The American Film Institute (AFI) lists three of Brooks&#x27;s films on its AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs list: &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; (#6), &quot;The Producers&quot; (#11), and &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; (#13).

On December 5, 2009, Brooks was one of five recipients of the 2009 Kennedy Center Honors at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC. He was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame on April 23, 2010, with a motion pictures star located at 6712 Hollywood Boulevard. American Masters produced a biography on Brooks which premiered May 20, 2013, on PBS. The AFI presented Brooks with its highest tribute, the AFI Life Achievement Award, in June 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube/AFI/Brooks&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Brooks was honored in a handprint and footprint ceremony at TCL Chinese Theatre. His concrete handprints include a six-fingered left hand as he wore a prosthetic finger when making his prints. On March 20, 2015, he received a British Film Institute Fellowship from the British Film Institute.
== Personal life ==

=== Marriages ===
Brooks met Florence Baum, a dancer in &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;, on Broadway.&lt;ref name=&quot;actorsequity/News/2011-01&quot;&gt;
* 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ibdb/98609&quot;&gt;
* 
&lt;/ref&gt; They were married from 1953 until their divorce in 1962. They had three children. After earning a salary of $5,000 a week on &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; and &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Hour&quot;, his salary dropped to $85 a week as a freelance writer. For five years he had few gigs, and was living in Greenwich Village on Perry Street in a fourth-floor walk-up.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanityfair/making-producers&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, to escape his situation, Brooks moved in with a friend, in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;grunge/363048&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, after his return to New York, he found that Baum had begun suing him for legal separation. &quot;Marriage Is a Dirty Rotten Fraud&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;archives.nypl/22177#c1030225&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was an autobiographical script based on his marriage. By 1966, Brooks was &quot;living in a fairly old but comfortable New York town house&quot;.

Brooks married actress Anne Bancroft in 1964, and they remained together for 41 years until her death in 2005. They met at a rehearsal for the &quot;Perry Como Variety Show&quot; in 1961, and were married three years later on August 5, 1964, at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. Their son, Max Brooks, was born in 1972. In 2010, Brooks credited Bancroft as &quot;the guiding force&quot; behind his involvement in developing &quot;The Producers&quot; and &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; for the musical theater, saying of an early meeting with her: &quot;From that day, until her death ... we were glued together.&quot; He has remained single since she died, stating in 2023 that &quot;Once you are married to Anne Bancroft, others don&#x27;t seem to be appealing&quot;. According to David DeLuise on &quot;Wizards of Waverly Pod&quot;, Brooks is his godfather. DeLuise&#x27;s father Dom DeLuise was a frequent costar of Brooks in his earlier career.

=== Interests ===
Brooks is a voracious reader; in a profile for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Kenneth Tynan describes &quot;Brooks the secret connoisseur, worshiper of good writing, and expert on the Russian classics, with special reverence to Gogol, Turgenev, Dostoevski, and Tolstoy.&quot; In &quot;The Producers&quot;, Bialystock refers to Bloom as &quot;Prince Myshkin&quot;, a character from Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Idiot&quot;, and the name Leo Bloom is a reference to Leopold Bloom, hero of Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

=== Religious beliefs ===
Regarding religion, Brooks stated, &quot;I&#x27;m rather secular. I&#x27;m basically Jewish. But I think I&#x27;m Jewish not because of the Jewish religion at all. I think it&#x27;s the relationship with the people and the pride I have. The tribe surviving so many misfortunes, and being so brave and contributing so much knowledge to the world and showing courage&quot;.

Brooks has consistently expressed pride in his Jewish identity. In 2021, Brooks told NPR&#x27;s Terry Gross: &quot;I love being a Jew, I love Jewish humor...&quot;

On Jewish cinema, Brooks said, &quot;They can be anything and anywhere ... if there&#x27;s a tribal thing, like, the &#x27;please God, protect us&#x27; feeling ... we don&#x27;t know where and how it&#x27;s gonna come out. &quot;Avatar&quot; was a Jewish movie ... these people on the run, chasing—and being pursued&quot;.

=== Politics ===
Brooks endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election in his first-ever public endorsement of a political candidate. He endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

<text>Mycoplasma genitalium (also known as MG&quot;,&quot; Mgen, or since 2018, Mycoplasmoides genitalium) is a sexually transmitted, small and pathogenic bacterium that lives on the mucous epithelial cells of the urinary and genital tracts in humans. Medical reports published in 2007 and 2015 state that Mgen is becoming increasingly common. Resistance to multiple antibiotics, including the macrolide azithromycin, which until recently was the most reliable treatment, is becoming prevalent. The bacterium was first isolated from the urogenital tract of humans in 1981, and was eventually identified as a new species of &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; in 1983. It can cause negative health effects in men and women. It also increases the risk for HIV spread with higher occurrences in those previously treated with the azithromycin antibiotics.

==Symptoms of infection==
Mgen is a bacterium recognized for causing urethritis in both men and women along with cervicitis and pelvic inflammation in women. It presents clinically similar symptoms to that of &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot; infection and has shown higher incidence rates, compared to both &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot; and &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot; infections in some populations.

Infection with Mgen can be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Both men and women may experience inflammation in the urethra (urethritis), characterized by mucopurulent discharge in the urinary tract, and burning while urinating. In women, it causes cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory diseases (PID), including endometritis and salpingitis. Women may also experience bleeding after sex and it is also linked with tubal factor infertility. For men, the most common signs are painful urination or a watery discharge from the penis.

There is a consistent association of &quot;M. genitalium&quot; infection and female reproductive tract syndromes. &quot;M. genitalium&quot; infection was significantly associated with increased risk of preterm birth, spontaneous abortion, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease. In addition, this pathogen may latently infect the chorionic villi tissues of pregnant women, thereby impacting pregnancy outcome. Infertility risk is also strongly associated with infection with &quot;M. genitalium&quot;, although evidence suggests it is not associated with male infertility. When &quot;M. genitalium&quot; is a co-infectious agent risk associations are stronger and statistically significant.

Polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that it is a cause of acute non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) and probably chronic NGU. It is strongly associated with persistent and recurring non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU), responsible for 15 percent to 20 percent of symptomatic NGU cases in men. Unlike other mycoplasmas, the infection is not associated with bacterial vaginosis. It is highly associated with the intensity of HIV infection. Some scientists are performing research to determine if Mgen could play a role in the development of prostate and ovarian cancers and lymphomas in some individuals. These studies have yet to find conclusive evidence to suggest a link.

==Genome==

The genome of &quot;M. genitalium&quot; strain G37T consists in one circular DNA molecule of 580,070 base pairs. Scott N. Peterson and his team at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill reported the first genetic map using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in 1991. They performed an initial study of the genome using sequencing in 1993, by which they found 100,993 nucleotides and 390 protein-coding genes. Collaborating with researchers at The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR; now the J. Craig Venter Institute), which included Craig Venter, they made the complete genome sequence in 1995 using shotgun sequencing. Only 470 predicted coding regions were identified in 1995, including genes required for DNA replication, transcription and translation, DNA repair, cellular transport, and energy metabolism. It was the second complete bacterial genome ever sequenced, after &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;. Later data from KEGG reports 476 protein-coding genes and 43 RNA genes, totaling 519. It is unclear where the &quot;525&quot; gene count for the G37T stems from and what gene calling procedure was used.

In 2006, the team at the J. Craig Venter Institute reported that only 382 genes are essential for biological functions. The small genome of &quot;M. genitalium&quot; made it the organism of choice in The Minimal Genome Project, a study to find the smallest set of genetic material necessary to sustain life.

There is limited divergence among clinical strains of &quot;M. genitalium&quot;. All strains retain the small genome size.

==Diagnosis==
Recent research shows that prevalence of Mgen is currently higher than other commonly occurring sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Mgen is a fastidious organism with prolonged growth durations. This makes detection of the pathogen in clinical specimens and subsequent isolation extremely difficult. Lacking a cell wall, Mycoplasma remains unaffected by commonly used antibiotics. The absence of specific serological assays leaves nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) as the only viable option for detection of Mgen DNA or RNA. However, samples with positive NAAT for the pathogen should be tested for macrolide resistance mutations, which are strongly correlated to azithromycin treatment failures, owing to rapid rates of mutation of the pathogen. Mutations in the 23S rRNA gene of Mgen have been linked with clinical treatment failure and high level in vitro macrolide resistance. Macrolide resistance mediating mutations have been observed in 20-50% of cases in the UK, Denmark, Sweden, Australia, and Japan. Resistance is also developing towards the second-line antimicrobials like fluoroquinolone.

According to the European guidelines, the indication for commencement of diagnosis for Mgen infection are:

# Detection of nucleic acid (DNA and/or RNA) specific for Mgen in a clinical specimen
# Current partners of individuals who tested positive for Mgen should be treated with the same antimicrobial as the index patient
# If current partner does not attend for evaluation and testing, treatment with the same regimen as given to the index patient should be offered on epidemiological grounds
# On epidemiological grounds for sexual contacts in the previous 3 months; ideally, specimens for a Mgen NAAT should be collected before treatment and treatment should not be given before the result are available

Screening for Mgen with a combination of detection and macrolide resistance mutations will provide the adequate information required to develop personalised antimicrobial treatments, in order to optimise patient management and control the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

===Detection of resistance===
Owing to the widespread macrolide resistance, samples that are positive for Mgen should ideally be followed up with an assay capable of detecting mutations that mediate antimicrobial resistance. The European Guideline on Mgen infections recommend complementing the molecular detection of Mgen with an assay capable of detecting macrolide resistance-associated mutations. Furthermore, molecular assays for quinolone resistance-associated mutations are available at specialised laboratories in suspected treatment failure due to treatment with moxifloxacin.

==Treatment==
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a step-wise treatment approach for &quot;Mycoplasma genitalium&quot; with doxycycline for seven days followed immediately by a seven-day course of moxifloxacin as the preferred therapy due to high rates of macrolide resistance. If resistance assay testing is available, and the Mgen is sensitive to macrolides, the CDC recommends a seven-day course of doxycycline followed by a four-day course of azithromycin. Although the majority of &quot;M. genitalium&quot; strains are sensitive to moxifloxacin, resistance has been reported, and potential for serious, adverse side effects should be considered with this regimen. Floroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions that have occurred together including:
* Tendinitis and tendon rupture
* Peripheral Neuropathy
* Central nervous system effects

and other serious side effects detailed in the FDA black box warning. Moxifloxacin/Avelox should be reserved for use when patients have no other treatment options. 

In settings without access to resistance testing, or if moxifloxacin cannot be used, the CDC recommends as an alternative regimen: seven days of doxycycline followed by the four-day course of azithromycin, with a test of cure 21 days after treatment being required due to the high rate of macrolide resistance. Beta lactam antibiotics are not effective against Mgen as the organism lacks a cell wall.

In the UK the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) guidelines for treatment are:
* Doxycycline 100mg twice a day for seven days followed by azithromycin 1 gram orally as a single dose then 500mg orally once daily for 2 days where organism is known to be macrolide-sensitive or where resistance status is unknown.
* Moxifloxacin 400mg orally once daily for 10 days if organism known to be macrolide-resistant or where treatment with azithromycin has failed.

Treatment of &quot;Mycoplasma genitalium&quot; infections is becoming increasingly difficult due to rapidly growing antimicrobial resistance. Diagnosis and treatment is further hampered by the fact that &quot;Mycoplasma genitalium&quot; infections are not routinely tested. Studies have demonstrated that a 5-day course of azithromycin has a superior cure rate compared to a single, larger dose. Further, a single dose of azithromycin can lead to the bacteria becoming resistant to azithromycin. Among Swedish patients, doxycycline was shown to be relatively ineffective (with a cure rate of 48% for women and 38% for men); and treatment with a single dose of azithromycin is not prescribed due to it inducing antimicrobial resistance. The five-day treatment with azithromycin showed no development of antimicrobial resistance. Based on these findings, UK doctors are moving to the 5-day azithromycin regimen. Doxycycline is also still used, and moxifloxacin is used as a second-line treatment in case doxycyline and azithromycin are not able to eradicate the infection.
In patients where doxycycline, azithromycin and moxifloxacin all failed, pristinamycin has been shown to still be able to eradicate the infection.

==History==
&quot;Mycoplasma genitalium&quot; was originally isolated in 1980 from urethral specimens of two male patients with non-gonococcal urethritis in the genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, Paddington, London. It was reported in 1981 by a team led by Joseph G. Tully. Under electron microscopy, it appears as a flask-shaped cell with a narrow terminal portion that is crucial for its attachment to the host cell surfaces. The bacterial cell is slightly elongated, somewhat like a vase, and measures 0.6–0.7 μm in length, 0.3–0.4 μm at the broadest region, and 0.06–0.08 μm at the tip. The base is broad while the tip is stretched into a narrow neck, which terminates with a cap. The terminal region has a specialised region called nap, which is absent in other mycoplasmas. Serological tests indicated that the bacterium was not related to known species of &quot;Mycoplasma&quot;. The comparison of genome sequences with other urinogenital bacteria, such as &quot;M. hominis&quot; and &quot;Ureaplasma parvum&quot;, revealed that &quot;M. genitalium&quot; is significantly different, especially in the energy-generating pathways, although it shared a core genome of ~250 protein-encoding genes.

In 2018, Gupta et al. proposed to change the name of &quot;Mycoplasma genitalium&quot; to &quot;Mycoplasmoides genitalium&quot; on phylogenetic grounds, reflecting the existing knowledge that &quot;M. genitalium&quot; is not very related to other &quot;Mycoplasma&quot;. The change became correct name under the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP, &quot;Code&quot;) with Validation List 184, published by the ICSP (&quot;Committee&quot;). Mycoplasmaologists working in the field generally oppose this renaming. In 2019, they published an opinion paper arguing that even though the phylogenetic methods are valid, Gupta&#x27;s renaming scheme causes too many changes, which is impractical and confusing. They cite some essential principles of the Code, such as &quot;no unnecessary new names&quot;, &quot;aim at stability of names&quot;, and &quot;avoid or reject the use of names which may cause error or confusion&quot;. However, the 2019 argument for preserving old names was rejected by the Committee in Opinion 122 of 2022, where it was ruled that the argument incorrectly cited the Code. The Opinion emphasizes that use of an older validly published name remains acceptable under the Code.

==Synthetic genome==
On 6 October 2007, Craig Venter announced that a team of scientists led by Nobel laureate Hamilton Smith at the J. Craig Venter Institute had successfully constructed synthetic DNA with which they planned to make the first synthetic genome. Reporting in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Venter said that they had stitched together a DNA strand containing 381 genes, consisting of 580,000 base pairs, based on the genome of &quot;M. genitalium&quot;. On 24 January 2008, they announced the successful creation of a synthetic bacterium, which they named &quot;Mycoplasma genitalium&quot; JCVI-1.0 (the name of the strain indicating J. Craig Venter Institute with its specimen number). They synthesised and assembled the complete 582,970-base pair genome of the bacterium. The final stages of synthesis involved cloning the DNA into the bacterium &quot;E. coli&quot; for nucleotide production and sequencing. This produced large fragments of approximately 144,000 base pairs or 1/4th of the whole genome. Finally, the products were cloned inside the yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; to synthesize the 580,000 base pairs. The molecular size of the synthetic bacterial genome is 360,110 kilodaltons (kDa). Printed in 10-point font, the letters of the genome cover 147 pages.

On 20 July 2012, Stanford University and the J. Craig Venter Institute announced successful simulation of the complete life cycle of a &quot;Mycoplasma genitalium&quot; cell, in the journal &quot;Cell&quot;. The entire organism is modeled in terms of its molecular components, integrating all cellular processes into a single model. Using object oriented programming to model the interactions of 28 categories of molecules, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites, and running on a 128 computer Linux cluster, the simulation takes 10 hours for a single &quot;M. genitalium&quot; cell to divide once—about the same time the actual cell takes—and generates half a gigabyte of data.

==Research==
The discovery of Protein M, a protein produced by &quot;M. genitalium&quot;, was announced in February 2014. The protein was identified during investigations on the origin of multiple myeloma, a B-cell hematologic neoplasm. To understand the long-term &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; infection, it was found that antibodies from multiple myeloma patients&#x27; blood were recognised by &quot;M. genitalium&quot;. The antibody reactivity was due to a protein, designated Protein M, that is chemically responsive to all types of human and nonhuman antibodies available. The protein is about 50 kDa in size, and composed of 556 amino acids.

Mgen evolved from a gram-positive ancestor that was clostridium-like but has lost the genes to code for the enzymes involved in de novo nucleic acid synthesis, amino acid synthesis, and synthesis of fatty acids. This means that Mgen needs the host&#x27;s growth factors to keep reproducing. Although Mgen has abilities that help it adhere to cells, it is still unknown how the bacteria can maintain an infection inside the epithelial cells of the ectocervix and vagina when shedding of the apical layer of cells occur. The organism&#x27;s ability to have adhesion to host cells relies of two proteins, P110 and P140. Adhesion is an important step in beginning an infection in a cell and Mgen can adhere to spermatozoa, erythrocytes, and epithelial cells. The terminal organelle relies on these proteins as well because without them the organelle was not present. The segmented pair plates of Mgen is a core of dense electrons which is anchored to the cell membrane. The end of this core is in contact with the wheel complex and the wheel complex contains the proteins MG219, MG200, MG386, and MG491 which aid in the gliding motility of the bacteria. Although Mgen lacks secreted virulence factors, the protein MG186 degrades host nucleic acids due to it being a calcium-dependent membrane-associated nuclease.

<text>Mehmet Ali Ağca (; born 9 January 1958) is a Turkish hitman and former member of the Grey Wolves. He murdered the leftist journalist Abdi İpekçi on 1 February 1979 and was imprisoned. He escaped from prison and travelled illegally to Vatican City on 13 May 1981 to assassinate Pope John Paul II. However, after the failed assassination attempt, he was captured and imprisoned by the Italian police.

After being imprisoned for 19 years in Italy where he was visited by the Pope, he was deported to Turkey, where he served a ten-year sentence. Ağca was released from prison on 18 January 2010. He described himself as a mercenary with no political orientation, although he is known to have been a member of the fascist, Turkish ultra-nationalist Grey Wolves, as well as the state-sponsored Counter-Guerrilla.

Thirty-three years after his crime, Ağca visited Vatican City to lay white roses on the tomb of the recently canonized John Paul II, and said he wanted to meet Pope Francis, a request that was denied.

==Early life==

Ağca was born in the Hekimhan district, Malatya Province in Turkey. As a youth, he became a petty criminal and a member of numerous street gangs in his hometown. He became a smuggler between Turkey and Bulgaria. He claims to have received two months of training in weaponry and terrorist tactics in Syria as a member of the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) paid for by the Communist Bulgarian government, although the PFLP has denied this.

== Grey Wolves involvement ==
After training, Ağca went to work for the ultranationalist Turkish organization Grey Wolves. On 1 February 1979, in Istanbul, under orders from the Grey Wolves, he murdered Abdi İpekçi, editor of the major Turkish newspaper &quot;Milliyet&quot;. After being denounced by an informant, he was caught and sentenced to life in prison. After serving six months, he escaped with the help of Abdullah Çatlı, second-in-command of the Grey Wolves, and fled to Bulgaria, which was a base of operations for the Turkish mafia. According to investigative journalist Lucy Komisar, Ağca had worked on İpekçi&#x27;s assassination with Çatlı, who then reportedly helped organize Ağca&#x27;s escape from an Istanbul military prison. According to Komisar, some have suggested Çatlı was even involved in the Pope&#x27;s assassination attempt. According to Reuters, Ağca had escaped with suspected help from sympathizers in the security services. Komisar added that at the scene of the Mercedes-Benz crash where Çatlı died, he was found with a passport under the name of &quot;Mehmet Özbay&quot; — an alias also used by Ağca.

==Attempted assassination of the Pope==

In 1979 &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Ağca, whom it called &quot;the self-confessed killer of an Istanbul newspaperman&quot;, had described the Pope as &quot;the masked leader of the Crusades&quot; and threatened to shoot him if he did not cancel his planned visit to Turkey, which went ahead in late November 1979. The paper also said (on 28 November 1979) that the killing would be in revenge for the then still ongoing attack on the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which had begun on 20 November, and which he blamed on the United States or Israel.

Beginning in August 1980, Ağca began criss-crossing the Mediterranean region. According to his later testimony, he met with three accomplices in Rome, one a fellow Turk and the other two Bulgarians. The operation was commanded by Zilo Vassilev, the Bulgarian military attaché in Italy. He said that he was assigned this mission by Turkish mafioso Bekir Çelenk in Bulgaria. &quot;Le Monde diplomatique&quot;, however, has alleged that the assassination attempt was organized by Abdullah Çatlı &quot;in exchange for the sum of 3 million marks&quot;, paid by Bekir Çelenk to the Grey Wolves.

According to Ağca, the plan was for him and the back-up gunman Oral Çelik to open fire in St. Peter&#x27;s Square and escape to the Bulgarian embassy under the cover of the panic generated by a small explosion. On 13 May they sat in the Square, writing postcards and waiting for the Pope to arrive. When the Pope passed them, Ağca fired several shots and wounded him, but was grabbed by spectators and Vatican security chief Camillo Cibin. This prevented him from finishing the assassination or escaping. Two bullets hit John Paul II, one of them lodging in his lower intestine, the other hitting his left hand. Two bystanders were also hit. Çelik panicked and fled without setting off his bomb or opening fire. The Pope survived the assassination attempt.

==Prison time, release, and rearrest==
Ağca was sentenced in July 1981 to life imprisonment in Italy for the assassination attempt. Following his shooting, Pope John Paul II asked people to &quot;pray for my brother (Ağca), whom I have sincerely forgiven.&quot; In 1983, the Pope and Ağca met and spoke privately at the prison where Ağca was being held. The Pope was also in touch with Ağca&#x27;s family over the years, meeting his mother in 1987 and his brother a decade later.

Ağca&#x27;s release was requested in the summer of 1983 by the alleged kidnappers of Emanuela Orlandi, the young daughter of a Vatican employee, who mysteriously disappeared in Rome in June of that year. On 9 June 1997, Air Malta Flight 830 was hijacked by two men. After landing in Cologne, the hijackers demanded the release of Ağca. He was not released and the hijackers surrendered. After serving almost 20 years of a life sentence in prison in Italy, at the request of Pope John Paul II, Ağca was pardoned by the then Italian president Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in June 2000 and deported to Turkey.

Following his extradition, he was imprisoned for the 1979 murder of Abdi İpekçi and for two bank raids carried out in the 1970s. Ağca was arrested on 25 June and incarcerated in the Maltepe Military Prison. He fled to Bulgaria on 25 November and was sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot;. Ağca was extradited to Turkey in 2000 by benefiting from the Conditional Amnesty Law. This consideration granted to Ağca elicited strong reactions. Both cases were merged and tried before the Kadıköy 1st High Criminal Court. The single trial concerned the hijacking of Cengiz Aydos&#x27;s taxi in 1979, robbing the Yıldırım jewellery store in Kızıltoprak on 22 March 1979 and stealing money from the Fruko soda storage on 4 April 1979. On 18 January 2000, the judges dismissed the charges because of the statute of limitations on the case filed for the jewellery store robbery and for &quot;breach of the Firearms Act&quot; (law no. 6136). For embezzlement and money theft Ağca was sentenced to 36 years of imprisonment. Ağca&#x27;s lawyers applied for his release under Law no. 4516 on Parole and Deferral of Penalties in December 2000. Their request was denied by the 1st High Criminal Court of Kartal. The lawyers filed an appeal against this decision, but the appeals court upheld the ruling. Ağca&#x27;s life sentence was reduced to 10 years under a Turkish law that shortened prison sentences if served in a foreign prison. The money-laundering conviction and 36-year sentence were overturned because of the statute of limitations for robbery, which was 7 years under Turkish law.

In early February 2005, during the Pope&#x27;s final illness, Ağca sent a letter to the Pope wishing him well and also warning him that the world would end soon. When the Pope died on 2 April 2005, Ağca&#x27;s brother Adnan gave an interview in which he said that Ağca and his entire family were grieving, and that the Pope had been a great friend to them.

Ağca was released on parole on 12 January 2006. Mustafa Demirbağ, his lawyer, explained his release as a combination of amnesty and penal reform: an amnesty in 2000 deducted 10 years from his time, the court then deducted his 20 years in the Italian prison based on a new article in the penal code, and so he became eligible for parole for good behaviour. However, a report from the French AFP news agency stated that &quot;The Turkish judicial authorities still haven&#x27;t explained exactly which legal resources he had access to&quot;, and former Minister of Justice Hikmet Sami Türk, in government at the time of Ağca&#x27;s extradition, claimed that, from a legal viewpoint, his release was a &quot;serious mistake&quot; at best, and that he should have not been freed before 2012. However, on 20 January 2006, the Turkish Supreme Court ruled that his time served in Italy could not be deducted from his Turkish sentence and he was again imprisoned.

==Later developments and release==
On 2 May 2008, Ağca asked to be awarded Polish citizenship as he wished to spend the final years of his life in Poland, Pope John Paul II&#x27;s country of birth. Ağca stated that upon his release he wanted to visit Pope John Paul II&#x27;s tomb and partner with Dan Brown on writing a book.

Ağca was released from jail on 18 January 2010. He was transferred to a military hospital in order to assess if, at 52, he was still fit for compulsory military service. The military found him unfit for military service for having &quot;antisocial personality disorder&quot;. In a statement, he announced: &quot;I will meet you in the next three days. In the name of God Almighty, I proclaim the end of the world in this century. All the world will be destroyed, every human being will die. I am not God, I am not son of God, I am Christ eternal.&quot;

Ağca visited the tomb of John Paul II on 27 December 2014. He desired to become a Catholic priest in 2016 and go to Fátima, Portugal to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Marian apparitions there (Our Lady of Fátima).

==Claims of external involvement in the assassination attempt==
In November 2010, Ağca accused Cardinal Agostino Casaroli of being the mastermind behind the assassination attempt on John Paul II. It has also been alleged that the Soviet Union&#x27;s KGB ordered the assassination, because of John Paul II&#x27;s support for the Solidarity labor movement in Poland. Ağca stated this during one of his interrogations before trial.

When Ağca published his memoirs in 2013, his story changed completely, writing that the Iranian government and Ayatollah Khomeini ordered the assassination attempt on John Paul II. According to this new version of the events, Ağca received instructions and training in weapons and explosives in Iran, from Mohsen Rezai, under the orders of Ayatollah Jaffar Subhani and Ayatollah Khomeini. In his book, Ağca acknowledges that he lied previously about the Bulgarian and Soviet connection. He stayed in Sofia for about a month but was not in contact with any Bulgarian or other intelligence officers. In transit from Turkey to Western Europe, he was delayed in Sofia because his fake Indian passport was of such poor quality that on several occasions he had to bribe officials who became suspicious. So, he waited to receive a much better-quality Turkish passport from the Grey Wolves: a genuine passport issued by the Turkish government to another person, Faruk Faruk Özgün, only the photo of Özgün was replaced by a photo of Ağca.

When Pope John Paul II visited him in prison in Italy, on 27 December 1983 (two and a half years after the assassination attempt), Ağca recalls in his memoirs he kissed the hand of the Pope, having kissed three years earlier the hand of Khomeini in Iran, and when asked, he told John Paul II that Ruhollah Khomeini ordered the assassination. The claim was subsequently dismissed by the Vatican as a lie.

Ağca&#x27;s shooting of the Pope and possible KGB involvement is featured in Tom Clancy&#x27;s 2002 novel &quot;Red Rabbit&quot; and Frederick Forsyth&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fourth Protocol&quot;. He has also been mentioned in the book &quot;The Third Revelation&quot; by Ralph McInerny, and was portrayed by actors Christopher Bucholz in the RAI production &quot;Attentato al papa&quot;, Sebastian Knapp in the ABC TV biopic movie &quot;Have No Fear: The Life of Pope John Paul II&quot;, Massimiliano Ubaldi in CBS&#x27;s TV miniseries &quot;Pope John Paul II&quot; (both 2005) and Alkis Zanis in the 2006 Canadian TV sequel &quot;&quot;.

<text>A mummy is a dead human or an animal whose soft tissues and organs have been preserved by either intentional or accidental exposure to chemicals, extreme cold, very low humidity, or lack of air, so that the recovered body does not decay further if kept in cool and dry conditions. Some authorities restrict the use of the term to bodies deliberately embalmed with chemicals, but the use of the word to cover accidentally desiccated bodies goes back to at least the early 17th century.

Mummies of humans and animals have been found on every continent, both as a result of natural preservation through unusual conditions, and as cultural artifacts. Over one million animal mummies have been found in Egypt, many of which are cats. Many of the Egyptian animal mummies are sacred ibis, and radiocarbon dating suggests the Egyptian ibis mummies that have been analyzed were from a time frame that falls between approximately 450 and 250 BC.

In addition to the mummies of ancient Egypt, deliberate mummification was a feature of several ancient cultures in areas of America and Asia with very dry climates. The Spirit Cave mummies of Fallon, Nevada, in North America were accurately dated at more than 9,400 years old. Before this discovery, the oldest known deliberate mummy was a child, one of the Chinchorro mummies found in the Camarones Valley, Chile, which dates around 5050 BC. The oldest known naturally mummified human corpse is a severed head dated as 6,000 years old, found in 1936 at the in Argentina.

== Etymology and meaning ==
The English word &quot;mummy&quot; is derived from medieval Latin &quot;Mumia&quot;, a borrowing of the medieval Arabic word &quot;mūmiya&quot; (مومياء) which meant an embalmed corpse, as well as the bituminous embalming substance. This word was borrowed from Persian where it meant asphalt, and is derived from the word &quot;mūm&quot; meaning wax. The meaning of &quot;corpse preserved by desiccation&quot; developed post-medievally. The Medieval English term &quot;mummy&quot; was defined as &quot;medical preparation of the substance of mummies&quot;, rather than the entire corpse, with Richard Hakluyt in 1599 AD complaining that &quot;these dead bodies are the Mummy which the Phisistians and Apothecaries doe against our willes make us to swallow&quot;. These substances were called mummia.

The Oxford English Dictionary defines a mummy as &quot;the body of a human being or animal embalmed (according to the ancient Egyptian or some analogous method) as a preparation for burial&quot;, citing sources from 1615 AD onward. However, Chamber&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopædia&quot; and the Victorian zoologist Francis Trevelyan Buckland define a mummy as follows: &quot;A human or animal body desiccated by exposure to sun or air. Also applied to the frozen carcase of an animal imbedded in prehistoric snow&quot;.

Wasps of the genus &quot;Aleiodes&quot; are known as &quot;mummy wasps&quot; because they wrap their caterpillar prey as &quot;mummies&quot;.

== History of mummy studies ==

While interest in the study of mummies dates as far back as Ptolemaic Greece, most structured scientific study began at the beginning of the 20th century. Prior to this, many rediscovered mummies were sold as curiosities or for use in pseudoscientific novelties such as mummia. The first modern scientific examinations of mummies began in 1901, conducted by professors at the English-language Government School of Medicine in Cairo, Egypt. The first X-ray of a mummy came in 1903, when professors Grafton Elliot Smith and Howard Carter used the only X-ray machine in Cairo at the time to examine the mummified body of Thutmose IV. British chemist Alfred Lucas applied chemical analyses to Egyptian mummies during this same period, which returned many results about the types of substances used in embalming. Lucas also made significant contributions to the analysis of Tutankhamun in 1922.

Pathological study of mummies saw varying levels of popularity throughout the 20th century. In 1992, the First World Congress on Mummy Studies was held in Puerto de la Cruz on Tenerife in the Canary Islands. More than 300 scientists attended the Congress to share nearly 100 years of collected data on mummies. The information presented at the meeting triggered a new surge of interest in the subject, with one of the major results being the integration of biomedical and bioarchaeological information on mummies with existing databases. This was not possible prior to the Congress due to the unique and highly specialized techniques required to gather such data.

In more recent years, CT scanning has become an invaluable tool in the study of mummification by allowing researchers to digitally &quot;unwrap&quot; mummies without risking damage to the body. The level of detail in such scans is so intricate that small linens used in tiny areas such as the nostrils can be digitally reconstructed in 3-D. Such modelling has been utilized to perform digital autopsies on mummies to determine the cause of death and lifestyle, such as in the case of Tutankhamun.

== Types ==
Mummies are typically divided into one of two distinct categories: anthropogenic or spontaneous. Anthropogenic mummies were deliberately created by the living for any number of reasons, the most common being for religious purposes. Spontaneous mummies, such as Ötzi and the Maronite mummies, were created unintentionally due to natural conditions such as extremely dry heat or cold, or acidic and anaerobic conditions such as those found in bogs. While most individual mummies exclusively belong to one category or the other, there are examples of both types being connected to a single culture, such as those from the ancient Egyptian culture and the Andean cultures of South America. Some of the later well-preserved corpses of the mummification were found under Christian churches, such as the mummified vicar Nicolaus Rungius found under the St. Michael Church in Keminmaa, Finland. There are also cases that fall outside of these categories.

== Egyptian mummies ==


Until recently, it was believed that the earliest ancient Egyptian mummies were created naturally due to the environment in which they were buried. In 2014, an 11-year study by the University of York, Macquarie University and the University of Oxford suggested that artificial mummification occurred 1,500 years earlier than first thought. This was confirmed in 2018, when tests on a 5,600-year-old mummy in Turin revealed that it had been deliberately mummified using linen wrappings and embalming oils made from conifer resin and aromatic plant extracts.

The preservation of the dead had a profound effect on ancient Egyptian religion. Mummification was an integral part of the rituals for the dead beginning as early as the 2nd dynasty (about 2800 BC). Egyptians saw the preservation of the body after death as an important step to living well in the afterlife. As Egypt gained more prosperity, burial practices became a status symbol for the wealthy as well. This cultural hierarchy led to the creation of elaborate tombs, and more sophisticated methods of embalming.

By the 4th dynasty (about 2600 BC) Egyptian embalmers began to achieve &quot;true mummification&quot; through a process of evisceration. Much of this early experimentation with mummification in Egypt is unknown.

The few documents that directly describe the mummification process date to the Greco-Roman period. The majority of the papyri that have survived only describe the ceremonial rituals involved in embalming, not the actual surgical processes involved. A text known as &quot;The Ritual of Embalming&quot; does describe some of the practical logistics of embalming; however, there are only two known copies and each is incomplete. With regards to mummification shown in images, there are apparently also very few. The tomb of Tjay, designated TT23, is one of only two known which show the wrapping of a mummy (Riggs 2014).

Another text that describes the processes being used in the latter periods is Herodotus&#x27; Histories. Written in Book 2 of the &quot;Histories&quot; is one of the most detailed descriptions of the Egyptian mummification process, including the mention of using natron in order to dehydrate corpses for preservation. However, these descriptions are short and fairly vague, leaving scholars to infer the majority of the techniques that were used by studying mummies that have been unearthed.

By utilizing current advancements in technology, scientists have been able to uncover a plethora of new information about the techniques used in mummification. A series of CT scans performed on a 2,400-year-old mummy in 2008 revealed a tool that was left inside the cranial cavity of the skull. The tool was a rod, made of an organic material, that was used to break apart the brain to allow it to drain out of the nose. This discovery helped to dispel the claim within Herodotus&#x27; works that the rod had been a hook made of iron. Earlier experimentation in 1994 by researchers Bob Brier and Ronald Wade supported these findings. While attempting to replicate Egyptian mummification, Brier and Wade discovered that removal of the brain was much easier when the brain was liquefied and allowed to drain with the help of gravity, as opposed to trying to pull the organ out piece by piece with a hook.
Through various methods of study over many decades, modern Egyptologists now have an accurate understanding of how mummification was achieved in ancient Egypt. The first and most important step was to halt the process of decomposition, by removing the internal organs and washing out the body with a mix of spices and palm wine. The only organ left behind was the heart, as tradition held the heart was the seat of thought and feeling and would therefore still be needed in the afterlife. After cleansing, the body was then dried out with natron inside the empty body cavity as well as outside on the skin. The internal organs were also dried and either sealed in individual jars, or wrapped to be replaced within the body. This process typically took forty days.
After dehydration, the mummy was wrapped in many layers of linen cloth. Within the layers, Egyptian priests placed small amulets to guard the decedent from evil. Once the mummy was completely wrapped, it was coated in resin in order to keep the threat of moist air away. The resin was also applied to the coffin in order to seal it. The mummy was then sealed within its tomb, alongside the worldly goods that were believed to help aid it in the afterlife.

&quot;Aspergillus niger&quot;, a hardy species of fungus capable of living in a variety of environments, has been found in the mummies of ancient Egyptian tombs and can be inhaled when they are disturbed.

=== Mummification and rank ===

Mummification is one of the defining customs in ancient Egyptian society for people today. The practice of preserving the human body is believed to be a quintessential feature of Egyptian life. Yet even mummification has a history of development and was accessible to different ranks of society in different ways during different periods. There were at least three different processes of mummification according to Herodotus. They range from &quot;the most perfect&quot; to the method employed by the &quot;poorer classes&quot;.

==== &quot;Most perfect&quot; method ====

The most expensive process was to preserve the body by dehydration and protect against pests, such as insects. Almost all of the actions Herodotus described served one of these two functions.

First, the brain was removed from the cranium through the nose; the gray matter was discarded. Modern mummy excavations have shown that instead of an iron hook inserted through the nose as Herodotus claims, a rod was used to the brain via the cranium, which then drained out the nose by gravity. The embalmers then rinsed the skull with certain drugs that mostly cleared any residue of brain tissue and also had the effect of killing bacteria. Next, the embalmers made an incision along the flank with a sharp blade fashioned from an Ethiopian stone and removed the contents of the abdomen. Herodotus does not discuss the separate preservation of these organs and their placement either in special jars or back in the cavity, a process that was part of the most expensive embalming, according to archaeological evidence.

The abdominal cavity was then rinsed with palm wine and an infusion of crushed, fragrant herbs and spices; the cavity was then filled with spices including myrrh, cassia, and, Herodotus notes, &quot;every other sort of spice except frankincense&quot;, also to preserve the person.

The body was further dehydrated by placing it in natron, a naturally occurring salt, for 70 days. Herodotus insists that the body did not stay in the natron longer than 70 days. Any shorter time and the body would not be completely dehydrated; any longer, and the body would be too stiff to move into position for wrapping. The embalmers then washed the body again and wrapped it with linen bandages. The bandages were covered with a gum that modern research has shown is both a waterproofing agent and an antimicrobial agent.

At this point, the body was given back to the family. These &quot;perfect&quot; mummies were then placed in human-shaped wooden cases. Wealthy people placed these wooden cases in stone sarcophagi that provided further protection. The family placed the sarcophagus in the tomb upright against the wall, according to Herodotus.

==== Avoiding expense ====

The second process that Herodotus describes was used by middle-class people or people who &quot;wish to avoid expense&quot;. In this method, an oil derived from cedar trees was injected with a syringe into the abdomen. A rectal plug prevented the oil from escaping. This oil probably had the dual purpose of liquefying the internal organs but also of disinfecting the abdominal cavity. (By liquefying the organs, the family avoided the expense of canopic jars and separate preservation.) The body was then placed in natron for seventy days. At the end of this time, the body was removed and the cedar oil, now containing the liquefied organs, was drained through the rectum. With the body dehydrated, it could be returned to the family. Herodotus does not describe the process of burial of such mummies, but they were perhaps placed in a shaft tomb. Poorer people used coffins fashioned from terracotta.

==== Inexpensive method ====

The third and least expensive method the embalmers offered was to clear the intestines with an unnamed liquid, injected as an enema. The body was then placed in natron for seventy days and returned to the family. Herodotus gives no further details.

== Christian mummies ==
In Christian tradition, some bodies of saints are naturally conserved and venerated.

== Mummification in other cultures ==

=== Africa ===
In addition to the mummies of Egypt, there have been instances of mummies being discovered in other areas of the African continent. The bodies show a mix of anthropogenic and spontaneous mummification, with some being thousands of years old.

==== Canary Islands ====
The mummies of the Canary Islands belong to the indigenous Guanche people and date to the time before 14th-century Spanish explorers settled in the area. All deceased people within the Guanche culture were mummified during this time, though the level of care taken with embalming and burial varied depending on individual social status. Embalming was carried out by specialized groups, organized according to gender, who were considered unclean by the rest of the community. The techniques for embalming were similar to those of the ancient Egyptians, involving evisceration, preservation, and stuffing of the evacuated bodily cavities, then wrapping the body in animal skins. Despite the successful techniques utilized by the Guanche, very few mummies remain due to looting and desecration.

==== Libya ====

The mummified remains of an infant were discovered during an expedition by archaeologist Fabrizio Mori to Libya during the winter of 1958–1959 in the natural cave structure of Uan Muhuggiag. After curious deposits and cave paintings were discovered on the surfaces of the cave, expedition leaders decided to excavate. Uncovered alongside fragmented animal bone tools was the mummified body of an infant, wrapped in animal skin and wearing a necklace made of ostrich egg shell beads. Professor Tongiorgi of the University of Pisa radiocarbon-dated the infant to between 5,000 and 8,000 years old. A long incision located on the right abdominal wall, and the absence of internal organs, indicated that the body had been eviscerated post-mortem, possibly in an effort to preserve the remains. A bundle of herbs found within the body cavity also supported this conclusion. Further research revealed that the child had been around 30 months old at the time of death, though gender could not be determined due to poor preservation of the sex organs.

==== South Africa ====
The first mummy to be discovered in South Africa was found in the Baviaanskloof Wilderness Area by Dr. Johan Binneman in 1999. Nicknamed Moses, the mummy was estimated to be around 2,000 years old. After being linked to the indigenous Khoi culture of the region, the National Council of Khoi Chiefs of South Africa began to make legal demands that the mummy be returned shortly after the body was moved to the Albany Museum in Grahamstown.

=== Asia ===
The mummies of Asia are usually considered to be accidental. The decedents were buried in just the right place where the environment could act as an agent for preservation. This is particularly common in the desert areas of the Tarim Basin and Iran. Mummies have been discovered in more humid Asian climates; however, these are subject to rapid decay after being removed from the grave.

==== China ====

Mummies from various dynasties throughout China&#x27;s history have been discovered in several locations across the country. They are almost exclusively considered to be unintentional mummifications. Many areas in which mummies have been uncovered are difficult for preservation, due to their warm, moist climates. This makes the recovery of mummies a challenge, as exposure to the outside world can cause the bodies to decay in a matter of hours.

An example of a Chinese mummy that was preserved despite being buried in an environment not conducive to mummification is Xin Zhui. Also known as Lady Dai, she was discovered in the early 1970s at the Mawangdui archaeological site in Changsha. She was the wife of the Marquis of Dai during the Han dynasty, who was also buried with her alongside another young man often considered to be a very close relative. However, Xin Zhui&#x27;s body was the only one of the three to be mummified. Her corpse was so well-preserved that surgeons from the Hunan Provincial Medical Institute were able to perform an autopsy. The exact reason why her body was so completely preserved has yet to be determined.

Among the mummies discovered in China are those termed Tarim mummies because of their discovery in the Tarim Basin. The dry desert climate of the basin proved to be an excellent agent for desiccation. For this reason, over 200 Tarim mummies, which are over 4,000 years old, were excavated from a cemetery in the present-day Xinjiang region. The mummies were found buried in upside-down boats with hundreds of 13-foot-long wooden poles in the place of tombstones. DNA sequence data shows that the mummies had Haplogroup R1a (Y-DNA) characteristic of western Eurasia in the area of East-Central Europe, Central Asia and the Indus Valley. This has created a stir in the Turkic-speaking Uighur population of the region, who claim the area has always belonged to their culture, while it was not until the 10th century that Uighurs are said by scholars to have moved to the region from Central Asia. American Sinologist Victor H. Mair claims that &quot;the earliest mummies in the Tarim Basin were exclusively Caucasoid, or Europoid&quot; with &quot;east Asian migrants arriving in the eastern portions of the Tarim Basin around 3,000 years ago&quot;, while Mair also notes that it was not until 842 that the Uighur peoples settled in the area. Other mummified remains have been recovered from around the Tarim Basin at sites including Qäwrighul, Yanghai, Shengjindian, Shanpula (Sampul), Zaghunluq, and Qizilchoqa.

==== Iran ====


As of 2012, at least eight mummified human remains have been recovered from the Douzlakh Salt Mine at Chehr Abad in northwestern Iran. Due to their salt preservation, these bodies are collectively known as Saltmen. Carbon-14 testing conducted in 2008 dated three of the bodies to around 400 BC. Later isotopic research on the other mummies returned similar dates, however, many of these individuals were found to be from a region that is not closely associated with the mine. It was during this time that researchers determined the mine suffered a major collapse, which likely caused the death of the miners. Since there is significant archaeological data that indicates the area was not actively inhabited during this time period, current consensus holds that the accident occurred during a brief period of temporary mining activity.

==== Lebanon ====

In 1990, a team of speleologists uncovered eight mummies, dating back to around 1283 AD, during a rescue excavation in the e &#x27;Asi al-Hadath cave in the Qadisha Valley of Lebanon. The well-preserved spontaneous mummies, including an infant named dubbed Yasmine, offer insights into Maronite villagers&#x27; lives during the Mamluk era. The grotto&#x27;s high altitude and dry conditions naturally mummified the bodies. The discovery provides historical context, aligning with documented Mamluk raids in the region. Artifacts, including pottery with inscriptions, manuscripts, and clothing, suggest a Maronite community, and the mummies&#x27; burial practices parallel present-day Lebanese customs. The remains were called &quot;Maronite mummies&quot; because the individuals found in the &#x27;Asi-al Hadath cave were believed to be Maronites, an indigenous Christian community in the region. Some of the mummies have been transferred to the National Museum of Beirut.

==== Siberia ====
In 1993, a team of Russian archaeologists led by Dr. Natalia Polosmak discovered the Siberian Ice Maiden, a Scytho-Siberian woman, on the Ukok Plateau in the Altai Mountains near the Mongolian border. The mummy was naturally frozen due to the severe climatic conditions of the Siberian steppe. Also known as Princess Ukok, the mummy was dressed in finely detailed clothing and wore an elaborate headdress and jewelry. Alongside her body were buried six decorated horses and a symbolic meal for her last journey. Her left arm and hand were tattooed with animal style figures, including a highly stylized deer.

The Ice Maiden has been a source of some recent controversy. The mummy&#x27;s skin has suffered some slight decay, and the tattoos have faded since the excavation. Some residents of the Altai Republic, formed after the breakup of the Soviet Union, have requested the return of the Ice Maiden, who is currently stored in Novosibirsk in Siberia.

Another Siberian mummy, a man, was discovered much earlier in 1929. His skin was also marked with tattoos of two monsters resembling griffins, which decorated his chest, and three partially obliterated images which seem to represent two deer and a mountain goat on his left arm.

==== Philippines ====
Philippine mummies are called Kabayan Mummies. They are common in Igorot culture and their heritage. The mummies are found in some areas named Kabayan, Sagada and among others. The mummies are dated between the 14th and 19th centuries.

==== Korea ====

Mummies have been discovered in Korea that have been dated to around the 15th to 19th centuries, during the Joseon period. This is thought to be because of the rise of Neo-Confucianism in Korea, which prescribed certain burial practices that created conditions favorable to mummification. However, this mummification was likely unintentional, and even culturally seen as ominous and undesirable.

Mummification likely occurred due to a number of factors. One such factor was the airtight seal (especially as the Korean climate is unfavorable to mummification) around the bodies, which was achieved using a mix of lime, clay, and sand. Recreations of the sealing process found that chemical reactions with the lime possibly caused a high and prolonged release of heat, which killed bacteria in the bodies. In addition, a large amount of clothing was usually placed inside tombs, which led to a shortage of oxygen inside. Mummies buried using the lime mixture sealing technique reportedly have especially excellently preserved soft skin and hair, which has enabled medical and genetic studies to be performed. Insights have been offered into the lifestyles and pathologies of Korean people during this period. Specific diseases for each individual have been identified.

=== Europe ===

The European continent is home to a diverse spectrum of spontaneous and anthropogenic mummies. Some of the best-preserved mummies have come from bogs located across the region. The Capuchin monks that inhabited the area left behind hundreds of intentionally-preserved bodies that have provided insight into the customs and cultures of people from various eras. One of the oldest mummies (nicknamed Ötzi) was discovered on this continent. New mummies continue to be uncovered in Europe well into the 21st century.

==== Bog bodies ====

Great Britain, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark have produced a number of bog bodies, mummies of people deposited in sphagnum bogs, apparently as a result of murder or ritual sacrifices. In such cases, the acidity of the water, low temperature and lack of oxygen combined to tan the body&#x27;s skin and soft tissues. The skeleton typically disintegrates over time. Such mummies are remarkably well preserved on emerging from the bog, with skin and internal organs intact; it is even possible to determine the decedent&#x27;s last meal by examining stomach contents. The Haraldskær Woman was discovered by labourers in a bog in Jutland in 1835. She was erroneously identified as an early medieval Danish queen, and for that reason was placed in a royal sarcophagus at the Saint Nicolai Church, Vejle, where she currently remains. Another bog body, also from Denmark, known as the Tollund Man was discovered in 1950. The corpse was noted for its excellent preservation of the face and feet, which appeared as if the man had recently died. Only the head of Tollund Man remains, due to the decomposition of the rest of his body, which was not preserved along with the head.

==== Czech Republic ====

The majority of mummies recovered in the Czech Republic come from underground crypts. While there is some evidence of deliberate mummification, most sources state that desiccation occurred naturally due to unique conditions within the crypts.

The Capuchin Crypt in Brno contains three hundred years of mummified remains directly below the main altar. Beginning in the 18th century when the crypt was opened, and continuing until the practice was discontinued in 1787, the Capuchin friars of the monastery would lay the deceased on a pillow of bricks on the ground. The unique air quality and topsoil within the crypt naturally preserved the bodies over time.

Approximately fifty mummies were discovered in an abandoned crypt beneath the Church of St. Procopius of Sázava in Vamberk in the mid-1980s. Workers digging a trench accidentally broke into the crypt, which began to fill with waste water. The mummies quickly began to deteriorate, though thirty-four were able to be rescued and stored temporarily at the District Museum of the Orlické Mountains until they could be returned to the monastery in 2000. The mummies range in age and social status at time of death, with at least two children and one priest. The majority of the Vamberk mummies date from the 18th century.

The Klatovy catacombs currently house an exhibition of Jesuit mummies, alongside some aristocrats, that were originally interred between 1674 and 1783. In the early 1930s, the mummies were accidentally damaged during repairs, resulting in the loss of 140 bodies. The newly updated airing system preserves the thirty-eight bodies that are currently on display.

==== Denmark ====

Apart from several bog bodies, Denmark has also yielded several other mummies, such as the three Borum Eshøj mummies, the Skrydstrup Woman and the Egtved Girl, who were all found inside burial mounds, or tumuli.

In 1875, the Borum Eshøj grave mound was uncovered, which had been built around three coffins, which belonged to a middle aged man and woman as well as a man in his early twenties. Through examination, the woman was discovered to be around 50–60 years old. She was found with several artifacts made of bronze, consisting of buttons, a belt plate, and rings, showing she was of higher class. All of the hair had been removed from the skull later when farmers had dug through the casket. Her original hairstyle is unknown. The two men wore kilts, and the younger man wore a sheath which contained a bronze dagger. All three mummies were dated to 1351–1345 BC.

The Skrydstrup Woman was unearthed from a tumulus in Southern Jutland, in 1935. Carbon-14 dating showed that she had died around 1300 BC; examination also revealed that she was around 18–19 years old at the time of death, and that she had been buried in the summertime. Her hair had been drawn up in an elaborate hairstyle, which was then covered by a horse hair hairnet made by the sprang technique. She was wearing a blouse and a necklace as well as two golden earrings, showing she was of higher class.

The Egtved Girl, dated to 1370 BC, was also found inside a sealed coffin within a tumulus, in 1921. She was wearing a bodice and a skirt, including a belt and bronze bracelets. Found with the girl, at her feet, were the cremated remains of a child and, by her head, a box containing some bronze pins, a hairnet, and an awl.

==== Hungary ====

In 1994, 265 mummified bodies were found in the crypt of a Dominican church in Vác, Hungary from the 1729–1838 period. The discovery proved to be scientifically important, and by 2006 an exhibition was established in the Museum of Natural History in Budapest. Unique to the Hungarian mummies are their elaborately decorated coffins, with no two being exactly alike.

==== Italy ====

The varied geography and climatology of Italy has led to many cases of spontaneous mummification. Italian mummies display the same diversity, with a conglomeration of natural and intentional mummification spread across many centuries and cultures.

The oldest natural mummy in Europe was discovered in 1991 in the Ötztal Alps on the Austrian-Italian border. Nicknamed Ötzi, the mummy is a 5,300-year-old male believed to be a member of the Tamins-Carasso-Isera cultural group of South Tyrol. Despite his age, a recent DNA study conducted by Walther Parson of Innsbruck Medical University revealed Ötzi has 19 living genetic relatives.

The Capuchin Catacombs of Palermo were built in the 16th century by the friars of Palermo&#x27;s Capuchin monastery. Originally intended to hold the deliberately mummified remains of dead friars, interment in the catacombs became a status symbol for the local population in the following centuries. Burials continued until the 1920s, with one of the final burials being that of Rosalia Lombardo. In all, the catacombs host nearly 8000 mummies.

The most recent discovery of mummies in Italy came in 2010, when sixty mummified human remains were found in the crypt of the Conversion of St Paul church in Roccapelago di Pievepelago, Italy. Built in the 15th century as a cannon hold and later converted in the 16th century, the crypt had been sealed once it had reached capacity, leaving the bodies to be protected and preserved. The crypt was reopened during restoration work on the church, revealing the diverse array of mummies inside. The bodies were quickly moved to a museum for further study.

=== North America ===

The mummies of North America are often steeped in controversy, as many of these bodies have been linked to still-existing native cultures. While the mummies provide a wealth of historically significant data, native cultures and tradition often demands the remains be returned to their original resting places. This has led to many legal actions by Native American councils, leading to most museums keeping mummified remains out of the public eye.

==== Canada ====
Kwäday Dän Ts&#x27;ìnchi (&quot;Long ago person found&quot; in the Southern Tutchone language of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations), was found in August 1999 by three First Nations hunters at the edge of a glacier in Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Park, British Columbia, Canada. According to the Kwäday Dän Ts&#x27;ìnchi Project, the remains are the oldest well preserved mummy discovered in North America. (The Spirit Cave mummy although not well preserved, is much older.) Initial radiocarbon tests date the mummy to around 550 years-old.

==== Greenland ====

In 1972, eight remarkably preserved mummies were discovered at an abandoned Inuit settlement called Qilakitsoq, in Greenland. The &quot;Greenland Mummies&quot; consisted of a six-month-old baby, a four-year-old boy, and six women of various ages, who died around 500 years ago. Their bodies were naturally mummified by the sub-zero temperatures and dry winds in the cave in which they were found.

==== Mexico ====

Intentional mummification in pre-Columbian Mexico was practiced by the Aztec culture. These bodies are collectively known as Aztec mummies. Genuine Aztec mummies were &quot;bundled&quot; in a woven wrap and often had their faces covered by a ceremonial mask. Public knowledge of Aztec mummies increased due to traveling exhibits and museums in the 19th and 20th centuries, though these bodies were typically naturally desiccated remains and not actually the mummies associated with Aztec culture.

Natural mummification has been known to occur in several places in Mexico; this includes the mummies of Guanajuato. A collection of these mummies, most of which date to the late 19th century, have been on display at &quot;El Museo de las Momias&quot; in the city of Guanajuato since 1970. The museum claims to have the smallest mummy in the world on display (a mummified fetus). It was thought that minerals in the soil had the preserving effect, however it may rather be due to the warm, arid climate. Mexican mummies are also on display in the small town of Encarnación de Díaz, Jalisco.

==== United States ====
Spirit Cave Man was discovered in 1940 during salvage work prior to guano mining activity that was scheduled to begin in the area. The mummy is a middle-aged male, found completely dressed and lying on a blanket made of animal skin. Radiocarbon tests in the 1990s dated the mummy to being nearly 9,000 years old. The remains were held at the Nevada State Museum, though the local Native American community began petitioning to have the remains returned and reburied in 1995. When the Bureau of Land Management did not repatriate the mummy in 2000, the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe sued under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. After DNA sequencing determined that the remains were in fact related to modern Native Americans, they were repatriated to the tribe in 2016.

=== Oceania ===
Mummies from Oceania are not limited only to Australia. Discoveries of mummified remains have also been located in New Guinea, New Zealand, and the Torres Strait, though these mummies have been historically harder to examine and classify. Prior to the 20th century, most literature on mummification in the region was either silent or anecdotal. However, the boom of interest generated by the scientific study of Egyptian mummification lead to more concentrated study of mummies in other cultures, including those of Oceania.

==== Australia ====

The aboriginal mummification traditions found in Australia are thought be related to those found in the Torres Strait islands, the inhabitants of which achieved a high level of sophisticated mummification techniques. Australian mummies lack some of the technical ability of the Torres Strait mummies, however much of the ritual aspects of the mummification process are similar. Full-body mummification was achieved by these cultures, but not the level of artistic preservation as found on smaller islands. The reason for this seems to be for easier transport of bodies by more nomadic tribes.

==== New Guinea ====

Until the mid-twentieth century, the Angu (or Anga) people of Papua New Guinea practiced mummification by smoking the bodies of the dead. Sites of their preserved mummies exist in the Morobe Province.

==== Torres Strait ====

The mummies of the Torres Strait have a considerably higher level of preservation technique as well as creativity compared to those found on Australia. The process began with removal of viscera, after which the bodies were set in a seated position on a platform and either left to dry in the sun or smoked over a fire in order to aid in desiccation. In the case of smoking, some tribes would collect the fat that drained from the body to mix with ocher to create red paint that would then be smeared back on the skin of the mummy. The mummies remained on the platforms, decorated with the clothing and jewelry they wore in life, before being buried.

==== New Zealand ====
Some Māori tribes from New Zealand would keep mummified heads as trophies from tribal warfare. They are also known as Mokomokai. In the 19th century, many of the trophies were acquired by Europeans who found the tattooed skin to be a phenomenal curiosity. Westerners began to offer valuable commodities in exchange for the uniquely tattooed mummified heads. The heads were later put on display in museums, 16 of them in France alone. In 2010, at a ceremony in the Hôtel de Ville in Rouen, Rouen City Council returned one of the heads to New Zealand, despite earlier protests by the Culture Ministry of France.

There is also evidence that some Māori tribes may have practiced full-body mummification, though the practice is not thought to have been widespread. The discussion of Māori mummification has been historically controversial, with some experts in past decades claiming that such mummies have never existed.
The historical significance of full-body mummification within Māori culture is acknowledged by science, although there is still debate as to the nature of their exact mummification processes. Some mummies appear to have been spontaneously created by the natural environment, while others exhibit signs of direct human involvement. Generally, modern consensus tends to agree that there could have been a mixture of both types of mummification, similar to that of the Ancient Egyptian culture.

=== South America ===
The South American continent contains some of the oldest mummies in the world, both deliberate and accidental. The bodies were preserved by the best agent for mummification: the environment. The Pacific coastal desert in Peru and Chile is one of the driest areas in the world and the dryness facilitated mummification. Rather than developing elaborate processes such as later-dynasty ancient Egyptians, the early South Americans often left their dead in naturally dry or frozen areas, though some did perform surgical preparation when mummification was intentional. Some of the reasons for intentional mummification in South America include memorialization, immortalization, and religious offerings. A large number of mummified bodies have been found in pre-Columbian cemeteries scattered around Peru. The bodies had often been wrapped for burial in finely-woven textiles.

==== Chauchilla Cemetery ====

Chauchilla Cemetery is a cemetery that contains prehispanic mummified human remains and archeological artifacts, located south of the city of Nazca in Peru.

==== Chinchorro mummies ====
The Chinchorro mummies are the oldest intentionally prepared mummified bodies ever found. Beginning in 5th millennium BC and continuing for an estimated 3,500 years, all human burials within the Chinchorro culture were prepared for mummification. The bodies were carefully prepared, beginning with removal of the internal organs and skin, before being left in the hot, dry climate of the Atacama Desert, which aided in desiccation. A large number of Chinchorro mummies were also prepared by skilled artisans to be preserved in a more artistic fashion, though the purpose of this practice is widely debated.

==== Inca mummies ====

Several naturally-preserved, unintentional mummies dating from the Incan period (1438–1532 AD) have been found in the colder regions of Argentina, Chile, and Peru. These are collectively known as &quot;ice mummies&quot;. The first Incan ice mummy was discovered in 1954 atop El Plomo Peak in Chile, after an eruption of the nearby volcano Sabancaya melted away ice that covered the body. The Mummy of El Plomo was a male child who was presumed to be wealthy due to his well-fed bodily characteristics. He was considered to be the most well-preserved ice mummy in the world until the discovery of Mummy Juanita in 1995.

Mummy Juanita was discovered near the summit of Ampato in the Peruvian section of the Andes mountains by archaeologist Johan Reinhard. Her body had been so thoroughly frozen that it had not been desiccated; much of her skin, muscle tissue, and internal organs retained their original structure. She is believed to be a ritual sacrifice, due to the close proximity of her body to the Incan capital of Cusco, as well as the fact she was wearing highly intricate clothing to indicate her special social status. Several Incan ceremonial artifacts and temporary shelters uncovered in the surrounding area seem to support this theory.

More evidence that the Inca left sacrificial victims to die in the elements, and later be unintentionally preserved, came in 1999 with the discovery of the Llullaillaco mummies on the border of Argentina and Chile. The three mummies are children, two girls and one boy, who are thought to be sacrifices associated with the ancient ritual of &quot;qhapaq hucha&quot;. Recent biochemical analysis of the mummies has revealed that the victims had consumed increasing quantities of alcohol and coca, possibly in the form of chicha, in the months leading up to sacrifice. The dominant theory for the drugging reasons that, alongside ritual uses, the substances probably made the children more docile. Chewed coca leaves found inside the eldest child&#x27;s mouth upon her discovery in 1999 supports this theory.

The bodies of Inca emperors and wives were mummified after death. In 1533, the Spanish conquistadors of the Inca Empire viewed the mummies in the Inca capital of Cuzco. The mummies were displayed, often in lifelike positions, in the palaces of the deceased emperors and had a retinue of servants to care for them. The Spanish were impressed with the quality of the mummification which involved removal of the organs, embalming, and freeze-drying.

The population revered the mummies of the Inca emperors. This reverence seemed idolatry to the Roman Catholic Spanish and in 1550 they confiscated the mummies. The mummies were taken to Lima where they were displayed in the San Andres Hospital. The mummies deteriorated in the humid climate of Lima and eventually they were either buried or destroyed by the Spanish.

An attempt to find the mummies of the Inca emperors beneath the San Andres hospital in 2001 was unsuccessful. The archaeologists found a crypt, but it was empty. Possibly the mummies had been removed when the building was repaired after an earthquake.

== Self-mummification ==

Monks whose bodies remain incorrupt without any traces of deliberate mummification are venerated by some Buddhists who believe they successfully were able to mortify their flesh to death. Self-mummification was practiced until the late 1800s in Japan and has been outlawed since the early 1900s.

Many Mahayana Buddhist monks were reported to know their time of death and left their last testaments and their students accordingly buried them sitting in lotus position, put into a vessel with drying agents (such as wood, paper, or lime) and surrounded by bricks, to be exhumed later, usually after three years. The preserved bodies would then be decorated with paint and adorned with gold.

Bodies purported to be those of self-mummified monks are exhibited in several Japanese shrines, and it has been claimed that the monks, prior to their death, stuck to a sparse diet made up of salt, nuts, seeds, roots, pine bark, and tea.

== Modern mummies ==
=== Jeremy Bentham ===
In the 1830s, Jeremy Bentham, the founder of utilitarianism, left instructions to be followed upon his death which led to the creation of a sort of modern-day mummy. He asked that his body be displayed to illustrate how the &quot;horror at dissection originates in ignorance&quot;; once so displayed and lectured about, he asked that his body parts be preserved, including his skeleton (minus his skull, which despite being mis-preserved, was displayed beneath his feet until theft required it to be stored elsewhere), which were to be dressed in the clothes he usually wore and &quot;seated in a Chair usually occupied by me when living in the attitude in which I am sitting when engaged in thought&quot;. His body, outfitted with a wax head created because of problems preparing it as Bentham requested, is on open display in the University College London.

=== Vladimir Lenin ===

During the early 20th century, the Russian movement of Cosmism, as represented by Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov, envisioned scientific resurrection of dead people. The idea was so popular that, after Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s death, Leonid Krasin and Alexander Bogdanov suggested to cryonically preserve his body and brain in order to revive him in the future. Necessary equipment was purchased abroad, but for a variety of reasons the plan was not realized. Instead his body was embalmed and placed on permanent exhibition in the Lenin Mausoleum in Moscow, where it is displayed to this day. The mausoleum itself was modeled by Alexey Shchusev on the Pyramid of Djoser and the Tomb of Cyrus.

===Gottfried Knoche===

In late 19th-century Venezuela, a German-born doctor named Gottfried Knoche conducted experiments in mummification at his laboratory in the forest near La Guaira. He developed an embalming fluid (based on an aluminum chloride compound) that mummified corpses without having to remove the internal organs. The formula for his fluid was never revealed and has not been discovered. Most of the several dozen mummies created with the fluid (including himself and his immediate family) have been lost or were severely damaged by vandals and looters.

=== Summum ===
In 1975, an esoteric organization by the name of Summum introduced &quot;Modern Mummification&quot;, a service that utilizes modern techniques along with aspects of ancient methods of mummification. The first person to formally undergo Summum&#x27;s process of modern mummification was the founder of Summum, Summum Bonum Amen Ra, who died in January 2008. Summum is currently considered to be the only &quot;commercial mummification business&quot; in the world.

=== Alan Billis ===
In 2010, a team led by forensic archaeologist Stephen Buckley mummified Alan Billis using techniques based on 19 years of research of 18th-dynasty Egyptian mummification. The process was filmed for television, for the documentary &quot;Mummifying Alan: Egypt&#x27;s Last Secret&quot;. Billis made the decision to allow his body to be mummified after being diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2009. His body currently resides at London&#x27;s Gordon Museum.

=== Amélie of Leuchtenberg===
Amélie of Leuchtenberg (1812–1873) was Empress of Brazil as the wife of Emperor Pedro I (also King of Portugal as Pedro IV). Between February and September 2012, researchers at the University of São Paulo in Brazil exhumed her remains, as well as those of her husband and his first wife, Maria Leopoldina. They were surprised to find that the body of Amélie had been mummified. Skin, hair and internal organs were preserved. Examinations at the Hospital das Clínicas found an incision in the empress&#x27; jugular vein. Aromatics such as camphor and myrrh were injected into the incision during the embalming process. &quot;It certainly helped to nullify the decomposition&quot;, said Brazilian forensic archaeologist Valdirene Ambiel, responsible for the research. She added that another contributing factor was the casket, saying it was so hermetically sealed that there were no micro-organisms in it. Before the reinterment, scientists reembalmed Amélie&#x27;s mummified body using a method similar to the first one.

The remains of Amélie, Pedro I, and Maria Leopoldina are interred in the Monument to the Independence of Brazil in São Paulo.

=== Plastination ===

Plastination is a technique used in anatomy to conserve bodies or body parts. The water and fat are replaced by certain plastics, yielding specimens that can be touched, do not smell or decay, and even retain most microscopic properties of the original sample.

The technique was invented by Gunther von Hagens when working at the anatomical institute of the Heidelberg University in 1978. Von Hagens has patented the technique in several countries and is heavily involved in its promotion, especially as the creator and director of the Body Worlds traveling exhibitions, exhibiting plastinated human bodies internationally. He also founded and directs the Institute for Plastination in Heidelberg.

More than 40 institutions worldwide have facilities for plastination, mainly for medical research and study, and most affiliated to the International Society for Plastination.

== Treatment of ancient mummies in modern times ==

In the Middle Ages, based on a mistranslation from the Arabic term for bitumen, it was thought that mummies possessed healing properties. As a result, it became common practice to grind Egyptian mummies into a powder to be sold and used as medicine. When actual mummies became unavailable, the sun-desiccated corpses of criminals, slaves and suicidal people were substituted by mendacious merchants. Francis Bacon and Robert Boyle recommended them for healing bruises and preventing bleeding. The trade in mummies seems to have been frowned upon by Turkish authorities who ruled Egypt – several Egyptians were imprisoned for boiling mummies to make oil in 1424. However, mummies were in high demand in Europe and it was possible to buy them for the right amount of money. John Snaderson, an English tradesman who visited Egypt in the 16th century shipped six hundred pounds of mummy back to England.

The practice developed into a wide-scale business that flourished until the late 16th century. Two centuries ago, mummies were still believed to have medicinal properties to stop bleeding, and were sold as pharmaceuticals in powdered form as in mellified man. Artists also made use of Egyptian mummies; a brownish pigment known as mummy brown, based on &quot;mummia&quot; (sometimes called alternatively &quot;caput mortuum&quot;, Latin for &quot;death&#x27;s head&quot;), which was originally obtained by grinding human and animal Egyptian mummies. It was most popular in the 17th century, but was discontinued in the early 19th century when its composition became generally known to artists who replaced the said pigment by a totally different blend -but keeping the original name, mummia or mummy brown-yielding a similar tint and based on ground minerals (oxides and fired earths) and or blends of powdered gums and oleoresins (such as myrrh and frankincense) as well as ground bitumen. These blends appeared on the market as forgeries of powdered mummy pigment but were ultimately considered as acceptable replacements, once antique mummies were no longer permitted to be destroyed. Many thousands of mummified cats were also sent from Egypt to England to be processed for use in fertilizer.

During the 19th century, following the discovery of the first tombs and artifacts in Egypt, egyptology was a huge fad in Europe, especially in Victorian England. European aristocrats would occasionally entertain themselves by purchasing mummies, having them unwrapped, and holding observation sessions. The pioneer of this kind of entertainment in Britain was Thomas Pettigrew known as &quot;Mummy&quot; Pettigrew due to his work. Such unrolling sessions destroyed hundreds of mummies, because the exposure to the air caused them to disintegrate.

The use of mummies as fuel for locomotives was documented by Mark Twain (likely as a joke or humor), but the truth of the story remains debatable. During the American Civil War, mummy-wrapping linens were said to have been used to manufacture paper. Evidence for the reality of these claims is still equivocal. Researcher Ben Radford reports that, in her book &quot;The Mummy Congress&quot;, Heather Pringle writes: &quot;No mummy expert has ever been able to authenticate the story ... Twain seems to be the only published source – and a rather suspect one at that&quot;. Pringle also writes that there is no evidence for the &quot;mummy paper&quot; either. Radford also says that many journalists have not done a good job with their research, and while it is true that mummies were often not shown respect in the 1800s, there is no evidence for this rumor.

While mummies were used in medicine, some researchers have brought into question these other uses such as making paper and paint, fueling locomotives and fertilizing land.

== In popular culture ==
A 2023 report by &quot;CNN&quot; revealed that a number of museums in Britain were rethinking how they described their displays of ancient Egyptian human remains, known as &quot;mummies,&quot; in order to emphasize that these individuals were once living people. The museums started using terms such as &quot;mummified person&quot; or the individual&#x27;s name instead of &quot;mummy.&quot; The shift in language was also intended to distance the display of mummies from their depiction in popular culture, which often &quot;undermined their humanity&quot; by depicting them as supernatural monsters and perpetuating the notion of a &quot;mummy&#x27;s curse.&quot; The change in language is part of a larger effort by museums to address historical bias and reflect on the way they represent the past to audiences. The British Museum, for example, has not banned the use of the term &quot;mummy&quot; in its displays, but has started to use alternative terminology such as &quot;mummified remains&quot; and including the individual&#x27;s name when known.

<doc id="20226" wikidata="Q5831" url="?curid=20226" title="Melilla">
<text>Melilla (, ; ) is an autonomous city of Spain on the North African coast. It lies on the eastern side of the Cape Three Forks, bordering Morocco and facing the Mediterranean Sea. It has an area of . It was part of the Province of Málaga until 14 March 1995, when the Statute of Autonomy of Melilla was passed.

Melilla is one of the special territories of the member states of the European Union. Movements to and from the rest of the EU and Melilla are subject to specific rules, provided for &quot;inter alia&quot; in the Accession Agreement of Spain to the Schengen Convention.

As of 2019, Melilla had a population of 86,487. The population is chiefly divided between people of Iberian and Riffian extraction. There is also a small number of Sephardic Jews and Sindhi Hindus. Melilla features a diglossia between the official Spanish and Tarifit.

Like the autonomous city of Ceuta and Spain&#x27;s other territories in Africa, Melilla is subject to an irredentist claim by Morocco.

== Name==

Borrowed from Spanish, the English name &quot;&quot; is pronounced or to approximate the sound of the Spanish double L, properly in most standard Spanish dialects. The name is attested from the 9th century, deriving from Arabic (, ) of uncertain etymology. The name has been related to honey (; ; , ) since Melilla was a notable site for beekeeping in antiquity, a bee appearing prominently on the city&#x27;s bronze coinage under Mauretanian rule. Alternatively, it has been taken from words meaning &quot;discord&quot;, &quot;fever&quot;, or a medieval Arab figure. The placename perhaps comes from the Amazigh root M·L (meaning &#x27;white&#x27;), producing the Amazigh &quot;mlilet&quot; and which results in the local () via /l/→ [r] and /lt/ → [č] changes.

== History ==
=== Antiquity and Middle Ages ===

Melilla was a Phoenician and later Punic trade establishment under variations of the name Rusadir (, ), taken from the Phoenician name of the nearby Cape Three Forks. After Carthage&#x27;s defeat in the Punic Wars, the city fell under the control of the Roman client state Mauretania. After its annexation under Caligula, Claudius organized it as part of the province of Mauretania Tingitana. Pliny mentions it as a native hillfort and port (). It was made a Roman colony in , after which it was sometimes referenced as Flavia. Rusaddir was said to have once been the seat of a bishop, but there is no record of any bishop of the purported see and it is not included in the Catholic Church&#x27;s list of modern titular sees.

The political history is similar to that of towns in the region of the Moroccan Rif and southern Spain. Melilla was progressively ruled by the Vandals, Byzantines, and the Visigoths. In the early 6th century, it was the main port of the Mauro-Roman Kingdom. After the Islamic conquest of North Africa, it fell under the Umayyads, Cordobans, Idrisids, Almoravids, Almohads, Marinids, and Wattasids.

=== Early Modern period ===
During the 15th century, the city declined, like most Mediterranean cities of the Kingdom of Fez, eclipsed by those on the Atlantic. After the Catholic Monarchs&#x27; conquest of the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada in 1492, their Secretary gathered intelligence about the sorry state of the North African coast with territorial expansion in mind. He sent agents to investigate, and subsequently reported to the Catholic Monarchs that, as of 1494, locals had expelled the authority of the Sultan of Fez and had offered to pledge loyalty. While the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas put Melilla and Cazaza, until then reserved to the Portuguese, under the sphere of Castile, the conquest of the city had to wait, delayed by the French occupation of Naples.

The Duke of Medina Sidonia, Juan Alfonso Pérez de Guzmán, advocated seizing Melilla, to be headed by , and the Catholic Monarchs, Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, endorsed the initiative and provided the assistance of artillery officer Francisco Ramírez de Madrid. Melilla was occupied on 17 September 1497, virtually without violence as it was on the border between the Kingdom of Tlemcen and the Kingdom of Fez, and as a result had been fought over many times and left abandoned. No large-scale expansion into the Kingdom of Fez ensued, and, barring the enterprises of the Cardinal Cisneros along the Algerian coast in Mers El Kébir and Oran, and the rock of Badis in the territorial scope of the Kingdom of Fez, the Hispanic monarchy&#x27;s imperial impetus was eventually directed elsewhere, to the Italian Wars against France, and, especially after 1519, to the newly discovered continent across the Atlantic.

Melilla was initially jointly administered by the House of Medina Sidonia and the Crown, and a 1498 settlement required the former to station a 700-man garrison in Melilla and the latter to provide the city with a number of maravedíes and wheat &quot;fanegas&quot;. The Crown&#x27;s interest in Melilla decreased during the reign of Charles V. During the 16th century, soldiers stationed in Melilla were badly remunerated, leading to many desertions. The Duke of Medina Sidonia relinquished responsibility over the garrison of the place on 7 June 1556.

During the late 17th century, 
Alaouite sultan Ismail Ibn Sharif attempted to conquer the &quot;presidio&quot;, taking the outer fortifications in the 1680s and further unsuccessfully besieging Melilla in the 1690s.

One Spanish officer reflected, &quot;an hour in Melilla, from the point of view of merit, was worth more than thirty years of service to Spain.&quot;

=== Late Modern period ===
The current limits of the Spanish territory around the Melilla fortress were fixed by treaties with Morocco in 1859, 1860, 1861, and 1894. In the late 19th century, as Spanish influence expanded in this area, the Crown authorized Melilla as the only centre of trade on the Rif coast between Tetuan and the Algerian border. The value of trade increased, with goat skins, eggs and beeswax the principal exports, and cotton goods, tea, sugar and candles the chief imports.

Melilla&#x27;s civil population in 1860 still amounted to only 375 estimated inhabitants. In a 1866 Hispano-Moroccan arrangement signed in Fes, both parties agreed to allow for the installment of a customs office near the border with Melilla, to be operated by Moroccan officials. The Treaty of Peace with Morocco that followed the 1859–60 War entailed the acquisition of a new perimeter for Melilla, bringing its area to that where the 12 km2 the autonomous city currently stands. Following the declaration of Melilla as a free port in 1863, the population began to increase, chiefly with Sephardi Jews fleeing from Tetouan who fostered trade in and out of the city. The first Jews from Tetouan probably arrived in 1864, and the first rabbi arrived in 1867 and began to operate the first synagogue, located in the Calle de San Miguel. Many Jews arrived fleeing from persecution in Morocco instigated by Roghi Bu Hamara. Following the 1868 lifting of the veto of emigration to Melilla from Peninsular Spain, the population further increased with Spaniards. The Jewish population, who also progressively acquired Spanish citizenship, increased to 572 in 1893. The economic opportunities created in Melilla henceforth favoured the installment of a Berber population.

The first body of local government was the &quot;junta de arbitrios&quot; created in 1879, in which the military enjoy preponderance. The Polígono excepcional de Tiro, the first neighborhood outside the walled core (Melilla la Vieja), began construction in 1888.

In 1893, Riffian tribesmen launched the First Melillan campaign to try to conquer the city; the Spanish government sent 25,000 soldiers to defend it against them. The conflict was also known as the &quot;Margallo War&quot;, after Spanish General Juan García y Margallo, Governor of Melilla, who was killed in the battle. The new 1894 agreement with Morocco that followed the conflict increased trade with the hinterland, bringing the economic prosperity of the city to a new level. The total population of Melilla amounted to 10,004 inhabitants in 1896.
The turn of the new century saw attempts by France (based in French Algeria) to profit from their newly acquired sphere of influence in Morocco to counter Melilla&#x27;s trading prowess by fostering trade links with the Algerian cities of Ghazaouet and Oran. Melilla began to suffer from this, to which the instability brought by revolts against Muley Abdel Aziz in the hinterland also added, although after 1905 Sultan pretender El Rogui (Bou Hmara) carried out a defusing policy in the area that favoured Spain. The French occupation of Oujda in 1907 compromised the Melillan trade with that city, and the enduring instability in the Rif still threatened Melilla. Between 1909 and 1945, the &quot;modernista&quot; (Art Nouveau) style was prevalent in local architecture, making Melilla&#x27;s streets a &quot;true museum of &quot;modernista&quot;-style architecture&quot;, second only to Barcelona, mainly stemming from the work of architect Enrique Nieto.

Mining companies began to enter the hinterland of Melilla by 1908. A Spanish company, the , was constituted in July 1908, shared by Clemente Fernández, Enrique Macpherson, the Count of Romanones, the Duke of Tovar and , who appointed Miguel Villanueva as chairman. Thus two mining companies under the protection of Bou Hmara started mining lead and iron 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) from Melilla. They started to construct a railway between the port and the mines. In October of that year, Bou Hmara&#x27;s vassals revolted against him and raided the mines, which remained closed until June 1909. By July the workmen were again attacked and several were killed. Severe fighting between the Spaniards and the tribesmen followed, in the Second Melillan campaign that took place in the vicinity of Melilla.

In 1910, the Spaniards restarted the mines and undertook harbor works at Mar Chica, but hostilities broke out again in 1911. On 22 July 1921, the Berbers under the leadership of Abd el Krim inflicted a grave defeat on the Spanish at the Battle of Annual. The Spanish retreated to Melilla, leaving most of the protectorate under the control of the Republic of the Rif.

A royal decree pursuing the creation of an &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; in Melilla was signed on 13 December 1918 but the regulation did not come into force, and thus the existing government body, the , remained in force.

A &quot;junta municipal&quot; with a rather civil composition was created in 1927; on 10 April 1930, an &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; featuring the same membership as the junta was created, equalling to the same municipal regime as the rest of Spain on 14 April 1931, with the arrival of the first democratically elected municipal corporation on the wake of the proclamation of the Second Republic.

The city was used as one of the staging grounds for the July 1936 military coup d&#x27;état that started the Spanish Civil War.

In the context of the passing of the Ley de Extranjería in 1986, and following social mobilization from the Berber community, conditions for citizenship acquisition were flexibilised and allowed for the naturalisation of a substantial number of inhabitants, until then born in Melilla but without Spanish citizenship.

=== Autonomy and late 20th, 21st century===

In 1995, Melilla —until then just another municipality of the Málaga— became an autonomous city, as their Statute of Autonomy was passed.

On 6 November 2007, King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia visited Melilla, with several display of affection from the population. The visit also sparked protests from the Moroccan government. It was the first time a Spanish monarch had visited Melilla in 80 years.

Melilla, together with Ceuta, declared the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha —Feast of the Sacrifice— an official public holiday from 2010 onward. It is the first time a non-Christian religious festival has been officially celebrated in Spain since the Reconquista.

In 2018, Morocco decided to close the customs office near Melilla, the first time since mid-19th century, without any consultation wtith Spain. The customs office was expected to reopen in January 2023.

Melilla was the location of the last public statue in Spain to commemorate former dictator Francisco Franco following Spain&#x27;s Historical Memory Law, passed in 2007, which included provision to the removal of any artefacts which celebrated the Franco regime from all public buildings and spaces. Nonetheless, the statue remained on the Cuesta de la Florentina street until its final removal in 2021.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===

Melilla is in northwest Africa, on the shores of the Alboran Sea, a marginal sea of the Mediterranean, the latter&#x27;s westernmost portion. The city is arranged in a wide semicircle around the beach and the Port of Melilla, on the eastern side of the peninsula of Cape Tres Forcas, at the foot of and around the mouth of the Río de Oro intermittent water stream, above sea level. The urban nucleus was originally a fortress, Melilla la Vieja, built on a peninsular mound about in height.

The Moroccan settlement of Beni Ansar lies immediately south of Melilla. The nearest Moroccan city is Nador, and the ports of Melilla and Nador are within the same bay; nearby is the Bou Areg Lagoon.

=== Climate ===
Melilla has a hot Mediterranean climate on the border with a hot Semi-arid climate, influenced by its proximity to the sea, rendering much cooler summers and more precipitation than inland areas deeper into Africa. The climate, in general, is similar to the southern coast of peninsular Spain and the northern coast of Morocco, with relatively small temperature differences between seasons. Minimum temperatures have never been below during 1991-2020 period, and only 2.2 days per year have maximum temperature above .

== Government and administration ==
=== Self-government institutions ===
The government bodies stipulated in the Statute of Autonomy are the Assembly of Melilla, the President of Melilla and the Council of Government. The assembly is a 25-member body whose members are elected through universal suffrage every 4 years in closed party lists following the schedule of local elections at the national level. Its members are called &quot;local deputies&quot; but they rather enjoy the status of &quot;concejales&quot; (municipal councillors). Unlike regional legislatures (and akin to municipal councils), the assembly does not enjoy right of initiative for primary legislation.

The president of Melilla (who, often addressed as Mayor-President, also exerts the roles of Mayor, president of the Assembly, president of the Council of Government and representative of the city) is invested by the Assembly. After local elections, the president is invested through a qualified majority from among the leaders of the election lists, or, failing to achieve the former, the leader of the most voted list at the election is invested to the office. In case of a motion of no confidence the president can only be ousted with a qualified majority voting for an alternative assembly member.

The Council of Government is the traditional collegiate executive body for parliamentary systems. Unlike the municipal government boards in the standard &quot;ayuntamientos&quot;, the members of the Council of Government (including the vice-presidents) do not need to be members of the assembly.

Melilla is the city in Spain with the highest proportion of postal voting; vote buying (via mail-in ballots) is widely reported to be a common practice in the poor neighborhoods of Melilla. Court cases in this matter had involved the PP, the CPM and the PSOE.

On 15 June 2019, following the May 2019 Melilla Assembly election, the regionalist and left-leaning party of Muslim and Amazigh persuasion Coalition for Melilla (CPM, 8 seats), the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE, 4 seats) and Citizens–Party of the Citizenry (Cs, 1 seat) voted in favour of the Cs&#x27; candidate (Eduardo de Castro) as the Presidency of the Autonomous City, ousting Juan José Imbroda, from the People&#x27;s Party (PP, 10 seats), who had been in office since 2000.

Melilla also maintains a local police force known as Policia Local de Melilla (Ciudad Autonoma de Melilla - Policia Local).

=== Administrative subdivisions ===

Melilla is subdivided into eight districts (&quot;distritos&quot;), which are further subdivided into neighbourhoods (&quot;barrios&quot;):

== Economy ==
The gross domestic product (GDP) of the autonomous community was 1.6 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 0.1% of Spanish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 19,900 euros or 66% of the EU27 average in the same year. Melilla was the NUTS2 region with the lowest GDP per capita in Spain.

Melilla does not participate in the European Union Customs Union (EUCU). There is no VAT (IVA) tax, but a local reduced-rate tax called IPSI. Preserving the status of free port, imports are free of tariffs and the only tax concerning them is the IPSI. Exports to the Customs Union (including Peninsular Spain) are however subject to the correspondent customs tariff and are taxed with the correspondent VAT. There are some special manufacturing taxes regarding electricity and transport, as well as complementary charges on tobacco and oil and fuel products.
The principal industry is fishing. Cross-border commerce (legal or smuggled) and Spanish and European grants and wages are the other income sources.

Melilla is regularly connected to the Iberian peninsula by air and sea traffic and is also economically connected to Morocco: most of its fruit and vegetables are imported across the border. Moroccans in the city&#x27;s hinterland are attracted to it: 36,000 Moroccans cross the border daily to work, shop or trade goods. The port of Melilla offers several daily connections to Almería and Málaga. Melilla Airport offers daily flights to Almería, Málaga and Madrid. Spanish operators Air Europa and Iberia operate in Melilla&#x27;s airport.

Many people travelling between Europe and Morocco use the ferry links to Melilla, both for passengers and for freight. Because of this, the port and related companies form an important economic driver for the city.

=== Tourism ===

In order to boost growth and as a measure to promote tourism in the Autonomous City of Melilla, the Tourist Board has developed a Regulatory Decree for bonuses for Tourist Packages to Melilla.

The Tourist package consists of the application of discounts on return tickets by plane or boat provided that they include accommodation during the stay in Melilla in one of the types of tourist accommodation or at the home of a resident of the city and do not exceed, between the round trip dates, ten days.

== Water supply ==

Melilla&#x27;s water supply primarily came from a network of dug wells (which by the turn of the 21st century suffered from overexploitation and had also experienced a degradation of the water quality and the intrusion of seawater), as well as the capture of the Río de Oro&#x27;s underflow. Seeking to address the water supply problem, works for the construction of a desalination plant in the Aguadú cliffs, projected to produce a day, started in November 2003. The plant entered operation in March 2007. Its daily operation is partially funded by the central government. Relative to the Spanish average (and similarly to the Canary and Balearic Islands), the city&#x27;s population spends a comparatively larger amount of money on bottled water.

Funded by the European Regional Development Fund and the , works for the expansion of the plant&#x27;s production capabilities up to a day started by September 2020.

== Architecture ==
The dome of the Chapel of Santiago, built in the mid-16th century by Miguel de Perea with help from Sancho de Escalante, is a rare instance of Gothic architecture in the African continent.

Parallel to the urban development of Melilla in the early 20th century, the new architectural style of &quot;modernismo&quot; (irradiated from Barcelona and associated to the bourgeois class) was imported to the city, granting it a &quot;modernista&quot; architectural character, primarily through the works of the prolific Catalan architect Enrique Nieto.

Accordingly, Melilla has the second most important concentration of &quot;Modernista&quot; works in Spain after Barcelona, Mainly concentrated in the city&#x27;s ensanche. Nieto was in charge of designing the main Synagogue, the Central Mosque and various Catholic Churches.
== Demographics ==
=== Religion ===

Melilla has been praised as an example of multiculturalism, being a small city in which one can find Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, and Buddhists represented.

==== Judaism ====
Percentagewise, Melilla may be the most Jewish city in Spain with around 1,000 Jews still living in the city, down from 7,000 around the year 1930 which is mainly due to economic reasons resulting in moving to the Spanish mainland, Israel or elsewhere. Melilla plays an important part in the History of Jews in Spain, having been exempt from the expulsion of Jews from Spain. The expelled Spanish Jews were Sephardic Jews and subsequently found new home in neighboring Morocco, including Melilla. Especially during the second half of the 19th century, many of the expelled Sephardic Jews moved from northern Morocco to Melilla. The first ones were traders from the Moroccan cities who came for economic and safety reasons. Later, impoverished Jews from the rural Riffian areas joined, also because of safety reasons. Thus, Melilla&#x27;s special geographical and political situation has made the city the oldest and one of the most important centers of Sephardic Judaism in today&#x27;s Spain, traditional home of the Sephards.

==== Christianity ====
According to the Spanish Center for Sociological Research, Roman Catholicism is the largest religion in Melilla. In 2019, the proportion of Melillans that identify themselves as Roman Catholic was 65.0% (31.7% define themselves as not practising, while 33.3% as practising). 30% identify as followers of other faiths, 2.7% identify as non-believers, and 2.3% identify as atheists.

The Roman Catholic churches in Melilla belong to the Diocese of Málaga.

==== Islam ====
Muslims account for roughly half the population in Melilla.

==== Hinduism ====
There is a small, autonomous, and commercially important Hindu community present in Melilla, which has fallen over the past decades as its members move to the Spanish mainland and numbers about 100 members today.

=== Language ===
Melilla features a diglossia, with Spanish as the first and official language and Tarifit as the second language, with limited written codification, and usage restricted to family and domestic relations and oral speech.

The population can be thus divided into monolingual Spanish speakers of European ethnic origin (without competence in any other language than those formally taught at school); those descended from Tamazight-speaking parents, usually bilingual in Spanish and Tamazight; and Moroccan immigrants and cross-border workers, with a generally dominant Tamazight language (with some also competent in Arabic) and a L2 competence in Spanish. The Spanish spoken in Melilla is similar to the Andalusian variety from Cádiz, whereas the Berber variant spoken in Melilla is the Tarifit common with the neighbouring Nador area. Rather than Berber (), Berber speakers in Melilla use either the glotonym , or, in Spanish, for their language.

The first attempt to legislate a degree of recognition for Berber in Melilla was in 1994, in the context of the elaboration of the Statute of Autonomy, by mentioning the promotion of the linguistic and cultural pluralism (without explicitly mentioning the Berber language). The initiative went nowhere, voted down by PP and PSOE. Reasons cited for not recognizing Tamazight are related to the argument that the variety is not standardized.

== Border security ==
=== Defence and Civil Guard ===
The defence of the enclave is the responsibility of the Spanish Armed Forces&#x27; General Command of Melilla. The Spanish Army&#x27;s combat components of the command include:

* 52nd &quot;Regulares&quot; Infantry Regiment;
* 1st Tercio &quot;Gran Capitán&quot; Regiment of the Spanish Legion;
* 10th &#x27;Alcántara&#x27; Cavalry Regiment equipped with Leopard 2 main battle tanks and Pizarro infantry fighting vehicles;
* 32nd Mixed Artillery Regiment with &quot;Grupo de Artillería de Campaña I/32&quot; equipped with 155/52mm towed howitzers and &quot;Grupo de Artillería Antiaérea II/32&quot; equipped with 35/90 SKYDOR/35/90 GDF-007 anti-aircraft guns; and,
* 8th Engineer Regiment

The command also includes its headquarters battalion as well as logistics elements.

In addition to the defence of Melilla, the garrison is also responsible for the defence of islands and rock formations claimed by Spain off the coast of Morocco. Units of the garrison are deployed to these rock formations to secure them against Moroccan incursions and did so notably during the Perejil Island crisis in 2002. To enhance coastal security, the Spanish Navy based a dedicated patrol boat (&quot;Isla Pinto&quot;) in Melilla from mid-2023. Melilla itself is about distant from the main Spanish naval base at Rota on the Spanish mainland while the Spanish Air Force&#x27;s Morón Air Base is within proximity.

The Civil Guard is responsible for border security and protects both the territory&#x27;s fortified land border against frequent, and sometimes significant, migrant incursions.

=== Trans-border relations ===
Melilla forms a sort of trans-border urban conurbation with limited integration together with the neighbouring Moroccan settlements, located at one of the ends of a linear succession of urban sprawl spanning southward in Morocco along the R19 road from Beni Ensar down to Nador and Selouane. The urban system features a high degree of hierarchization, specialization and division of labour, with Melilla as chief provider of services, finance and trade; Nador as an eminently industrial city whereas the rest of Moroccan settlements found themselves in a subordinate role, presenting agro-town features and operating as providers of workforce.

The asymmetry, as reflected for example in the provision of healthcare, has fostered situations such as the large-scale use of the Melillan health services by Moroccan citizens, with Melilla attending a number of urgencies more than four times the standard for its population in 2018. In order to satisfy the workforce needs of Melilla (mainly in areas such as domestic service, construction and cross-border bale workers, often under informal contracts), Moroccan inhabitants of the province of Nador were granted exemptions from visa requirements to enter the autonomous city. This development in turn induced a strong flux of internal migration from other Moroccan provinces to Nador, in order to acquire the aforementioned exemption.

The &#x27;fluid&#x27; trans-border relations between Melilla and its surroundings are however not free from conflict, as they are contingent upon the &#x27;tense&#x27; trans-national relations between Morocco and Spain.

=== Border securitization ===

Following the increasing influx of Algerian and sub-Saharan irregular migrants into Ceuta and Melilla in the early 1990s, a process of border fortification in both cities ensued after 1995 to reduce the border&#x27;s permeability, a target attained to some degree by 1999, although peak level of fortification was reached in 2005.

Melilla&#x27;s border with Morocco is secured by the Melilla border fence, a tall double fence with watch towers; yet migrants (in groups of tens or sometimes hundreds) storm the fence and manage to cross it from time to time. Since 2005, at least 14 migrants have died trying to cross the fence. The Melilla migrant reception centre was built with a capacity of 480. In 2020 works to remove the barbed wire from the top of the fence (meanwhile raising its height up to more than in the stretches most susceptible to breaches) were commissioned to .

In June 2022, at least 23 sub-Saharan migrants and two Moroccan security personnel were killed when around 2,000 migrants stormed the border. The death toll has been estimated to be as high as 37 by certain NGOs. Around 200 Spanish and Moroccan law enforcement officers and at least 76 migrants were injured. Hundreds of migrants succeeded in breaching the fence, and 133 made it across the border. Widely circulated footage showed dozens of motionless migrants piled together. It was the worst such incident in Melilla&#x27;s history. The United Nations, the African Union and a number of human rights groups condemned what they deemed excessive force used by Moroccan and Spanish border guards, although no lethal weapons were employed, and the deaths were later attributed to &quot;mechanical asphyxiation&quot;.

Morocco has been paid tens of million euros by both Spain and the European Union to outsource the EU migration control. Besides the double fence in the Spanish side of the border, there is an additional high fence entirely made of razor wire lying on the Moroccan side as well as a moat in between.

== Transportation ==

Melilla Airport is serviced by Air Nostrum, flying to the Spanish cities of Málaga, Madrid, Barcelona, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Palma de Mallorca, Granada, Badajoz, Sevilla and Almería. In April 2013, a local enterprise set up Melilla Airlines, flying from the city to Málaga. The city is linked to Málaga, Almería and Motril by ferry.

Three roads connect Melilla and Morocco but require clearance through border checkpoints.

== Sport ==
Melilla is a surfing destination. The city&#x27;s football club, UD Melilla, plays in the third tier of Spanish football, the Segunda División B. The club was founded in 1943 and since 1945 have played at the 12,000-seater Estadio Municipal Álvarez Claro. Until the other club was dissolved in 2012, UD Melilla played the Ceuta-Melilla derby against AD Ceuta. The clubs travelled to each other via the Spanish mainland to avoid entering Morocco. The second-highest ranked club in the city are Casino del Real CF of the fourth-tier Tercera División. The football&#x27;s governing institution is the Melilla Football Federation.

== Dispute with Morocco ==
The Moroccan government has repeatedly called for Spain to transfer the sovereignty of Melilla, Ceuta and the &quot;plazas de soberanía&quot; to Morocco, with Spain&#x27;s refusal to do so serving as a major source of tension in Morocco–Spain relations. In Morocco, Ceuta is frequently referred to as the &quot;occupied Sebtah&quot;, and the Moroccan government has argued that the city, along with other Spanish territories in the region, are colonies. One of the major arguments used by Morocco in their attempts to acquire sovereignty over Melilla refers to the geographical position of the city, as Melilla is an exclave surrounded by Moroccan territory and the Mediterranean Sea and has no territorial continuity with the rest of Spain. This argument was originally developed by one of the founders of the Moroccan Istiqlal Party, Alal-El Faasi, who openly advocated for Morocco to invade and occupy Melilla and other North African territories under Spanish rule. Spain, in line with the majority of nations in the rest of the world, has never recognized Morocco&#x27;s claim over Melilla. The official position of the Spanish government is that Melilla is an integral part of Spain, and has been since the 16th century, centuries prior to Morocco&#x27;s independence from Spain and France in 1956. The majority of Melilla&#x27;s population support continued Spanish sovereignty and are opposed to Moroccan control over the territory.

In 1986, Spain joined NATO. However, Melilla is not under NATO protection since Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty limits such coverage to Europe and North America and islands north of the Tropic of Cancer. However, French Algeria was explicitly included in the treaty upon France&#x27;s entry. Legal experts have claimed that other articles of the treaty could cover Spanish territories in North Africa but this interpretation has not been tested in practice. During the 2022 Madrid summit, the issue of the protection of Melilla was raised by Spain, with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stating: &quot;On which territories NATO protects and Ceuta and Melilla, NATO is there to protect all Allies against any threats. At the end of the day, it will always be a political decision to invoke Article 5, but rest assured NATO is there to protect and defend all Allies&quot;. On 21 December 2020, following statements made by Moroccan Prime Minister Saadeddine Othmani that Melilla is &quot;Moroccan as the Sahara&quot;, the Spanish government summoned the Moroccan ambassador, Karima Benyaich, to convey that Spain expects all its partners to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its territory in Africa and asked for an explanation for Othmani&#x27;s words.

<doc id="20229" wikidata="Q20019" url="?curid=20229" title="Macaroni">
<text>Macaroni (), known in Italian as maccheroni, is a pasta shaped like narrow tubes. Made with durum wheat, macaroni is commonly cut in short lengths; curved macaroni may be referred to as elbow macaroni. Some home machines can make macaroni shapes but, like most pasta, macaroni is usually made commercially by large-scale extrusion. The curved shape is created by different speeds of extrusion on opposite sides of the pasta tube as it comes out of the machine.

The word &quot;macaroni&quot; is often used synonymously with elbow-shaped macaroni, as it is the variety most often used in macaroni and cheese recipes. In Italy and other countries, the noun &quot;maccheroni&quot; can refer to straight, tubular, square-ended &quot;pasta corta&quot; () or to long pasta dishes, as in &quot;maccheroni alla chitarra&quot; and &quot;frittata di maccheroni&quot;, which are prepared with long pasta such as spaghetti.
In the United States, federal regulations define three different shapes of dried pasta, such as spaghetti, as a &quot;macaroni product&quot;.

==Etymology==
In Italian, &quot;maccheroni&quot; refers to elongated pasta, not necessarily in tubular form. This general meaning is still retained outside Rome and in different languages which borrowed the word.

&quot;Maccheroni&quot; comes from Italian &quot;maccheroni&quot; (), plural form of &quot;maccherone&quot;. The academic consensus supports the position that the word is derived from the Greek μακαρία (&quot;makaría&quot;), a kind of barley broth which was served to commemorate the dead. In turn, that comes from μάκαρες (&quot;mákares&quot;), meaning the &#x27;blessed ones, blessed dead&#x27;, the plural of μάκαρ (&quot;mákar&quot;), which means &#x27;blessed, happy&#x27;; μακάριος (&quot;makários&quot;, from μάκαρ (mákar) + -ιος (-&quot;ios&quot;, adjective suffix)) and Μακάριος (&quot;Makários&quot;), &#x27;Makarios&#x27; (Latinized form: Macarius), are derived terms. The many varieties sometimes differ from each other because of the texture of each pasta: rigatoni and &quot;tortiglioni&quot;, for example, have ridges down their lengths, while &quot;chifferi&quot;, &quot;lumache&quot;, &quot;lumaconi&quot;, &quot;pipe&quot;, &quot;pipette&quot;, etc. refer to elbow-shaped pasta similar to macaroni in North American culture.

However, the Italian linguist G. Alessio argues that the word can have two origins. The first is the Medieval Greek μακαρώνεια (&quot;makarṓneia&quot;), &#x27;dirge&#x27; (stated in sec. XIII by James of Bulgaria), which would mean &#x27;funeral meal&#x27; and then &#x27;food to serve&#x27; during this office (see modern Eastern Thrace&#x27;s μαχαρωνιά (&quot;makharōniá&quot;) – &quot;macharōnia&quot; in the sense of &#x27;rice-based dish served at the funeral&#x27;), in which case, the term would be composed of the double root of μακάριος (&quot;makários&quot;), &#x27;blessed&#x27;, and αἰωνίως (&quot;aiōníōs&quot;), &#x27;eternally&#x27;. The second is the Greek μακαρία (&quot;makaría&quot;), &#x27;barley broth&#x27;, which would have added the suffix &quot;-one&quot;.

In his book &quot;Delizia! The Epic History of Italians and their Food&quot; (2007), John Dickie instead says that the word macaroni, and its earlier variants such as &quot;maccheroni&quot;, &quot;comes from &quot;maccare&quot;, meaning to pound or crush&quot;.

The word first appears in English as &quot;makerouns&quot; in the 1390 &quot;The Forme of Cury&quot;, which records the earliest recipe for macaroni and cheese. The word later came to be applied to overdressed dandies and was associated with foppish Italian fashions of dress and periwigs, as in the eighteenth-century British song &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot;.

==Culinary use outside Italy==
As is the case with dishes made with other types of pasta, macaroni and cheese is a popular dish and is often made with elbow macaroni. This is called macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom. A similar dish, Älplermagronen, with a base of cream and cheese originated in Switzerland in the 19th century. In Great Britain, particularly Scotland, macaroni cheese is a popular filling for pies, often consumed as a takeaway food or at football grounds. A sweet macaroni, known as macaroni pudding, containing milk and sugar (and rather similar to a rice pudding) was also popular with the British during the Victorian era. A popular canned variety is still manufactured by Ambrosia and sold in UK supermarkets.

In areas with large populations open to Western cultural influence such as Hong Kong, Macao, Malaysia and Singapore, the local Chinese have adopted macaroni as an ingredient for Chinese-style Western cuisine. In Hong Kong&#x27;s &quot;cha chaan teng&quot; (&#x27;tea restaurants&#x27;) and Southeast Asia&#x27;s &quot;kopi tiam&quot; (&#x27;coffee shops&#x27;), macaroni is cooked in water and then rinsed to remove starch, and served in clear broth with ham or frankfurter sausages, peas, black mushrooms, and optionally eggs, reminiscent of noodle soup dishes. This is often a course for breakfast or light lunch fare. Macaroni has also been incorporated into Malay Malaysian cuisine, where it is stir-fried akin to mee goreng using Asian seasoning similar to said noodle dish (i.e. shallots, oyster sauce and chili paste). In the Philippines, it is a key ingredient in sopas, a semi-clear chicken broth often with chicken meat, pork, carrots, and other vegetables. A common variant uses milk, specifically &quot;evaporada&quot;.

<text>In molecular biology, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is a single-stranded molecule of RNA that corresponds to the genetic sequence of a gene, and is read by a ribosome in the process of synthesizing a protein.

mRNA is created during the process of transcription, where an enzyme (RNA polymerase) converts the gene into primary transcript mRNA (also known as pre-mRNA). This pre-mRNA usually still contains introns, regions that will not go on to code for the final amino acid sequence. These are removed in the process of RNA splicing, leaving only exons, regions that will encode the protein. This exon sequence constitutes mature mRNA. Mature mRNA is then read by the ribosome, and the ribosome creates the protein utilizing amino acids carried by transfer RNA (tRNA). This process is known as translation. All of these processes form part of the central dogma of molecular biology, which describes the flow of genetic information in a biological system.

As in DNA, genetic information in mRNA is contained in the sequence of nucleotides, which are arranged into codons consisting of three ribonucleotides each. Each codon codes for a specific amino acid, except the stop codons, which terminate protein synthesis. The translation of codons into amino acids requires two other types of RNA: transfer RNA, which recognizes the codon and provides the corresponding amino acid, and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), the central component of the ribosome&#x27;s protein-manufacturing machinery.

The concept of mRNA was developed by Sydney Brenner and Francis Crick in 1960 during a conversation with François Jacob. In 1961, mRNA was identified and described independently by one team consisting of Brenner, Jacob, and Matthew Meselson, and another team led by James Watson. While analyzing the data in preparation for publication, Jacob and Jacques Monod coined the name &quot;messenger RNA&quot;.
==Synthesis==

The brief existence of an mRNA molecule begins with transcription, and ultimately ends in degradation. During its life, an mRNA molecule may also be processed, edited, and transported prior to translation. Eukaryotic mRNA molecules often require extensive processing and transport, while prokaryotic mRNA molecules do not. A molecule of eukaryotic mRNA and the proteins surrounding it are together called a messenger RNP.

===Transcription===

Transcription is when RNA is copied from DNA. During transcription, RNA polymerase makes a copy of a gene from the DNA to mRNA as needed. This process differs slightly in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. One notable difference is that prokaryotic RNA polymerase associates with DNA-processing enzymes during transcription so that processing can proceed during transcription. Therefore, this causes the new mRNA strand to become double stranded by producing a complementary strand known as the tRNA strand, which when combined are unable to form structures from base-pairing. Moreover, the template for mRNA is the complementary strand of tRNA, which is identical in sequence to the anticodon sequence that the DNA binds to. The short-lived, unprocessed or partially processed product is termed &quot;precursor mRNA&quot;, or &quot;pre-mRNA&quot;; once completely processed, it is termed &quot;mature mRNA&quot;.

===Uracil substitution for thymine===
mRNA uses uracil (U) instead of thymine (T) in DNA. uracil (U) is the complementary base to adenine (A) during transcription instead of thymine (T). Thus, when using a template strand of DNA to build RNA, thymine is replaced with uracil. This substitution allows the mRNA to carry the appropriate genetic information from DNA to the ribosome for translation. Regarding the natural history, uracil came first then thymine; evidence suggests that RNA came before DNA in evolution. The RNA World hypothesis proposes that life began with RNA molecules, before the emergence of DNA genomes and coded proteins. In DNA, the evolutionary substitution of thymine for uracil may have increased DNA stability and improved the efficiency of DNA replication.

=== Eukaryotic pre-mRNA processing ===
Processing of mRNA differs greatly among eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea. Non-eukaryotic mRNA is, in essence, mature upon transcription and requires no processing, except in rare cases. Eukaryotic pre-mRNA, however, requires several processing steps before its transport to the cytoplasm and its translation by the ribosome.

==== Splicing ====

The extensive processing of eukaryotic pre-mRNA that leads to the mature mRNA is the RNA splicing, a mechanism by which introns or outrons (non-coding regions) are removed and exons (coding regions) are joined.

A &quot;5&#x27; cap&quot; (also termed an RNA cap, an RNA 7-methylguanosine cap, or an RNA m7G cap) is a modified guanine nucleotide that has been added to the &quot;front&quot; or 5&#x27; end of a eukaryotic messenger RNA shortly after the start of transcription. The 5&#x27; cap consists of a terminal 7-methylguanosine residue that is linked through a 5&#x27;-5&#x27;-triphosphate bond to the first transcribed nucleotide. Its presence is critical for recognition by the ribosome and protection from RNases.

Cap addition is coupled to transcription, and occurs co-transcriptionally, such that each influences the other. Shortly after the start of transcription, the 5&#x27; end of the mRNA being synthesized is bound by a cap-synthesizing complex associated with RNA polymerase. This enzymatic complex catalyzes the chemical reactions that are required for mRNA capping. Synthesis proceeds as a multi-step biochemical reaction.

====Editing====
In some instances, an mRNA will be edited, changing the nucleotide composition of that mRNA. An example in humans is the apolipoprotein B mRNA, which is edited in some tissues, but not others. The editing creates an early stop codon, which, upon translation, produces a shorter protein. Another well-defined example is A-to-I (adenosine to inosine) editing, which is carried out by double-strand specific adenosine-to inosine editing (ADAR) enzymes. This can occur in both the open reading frame and untranslated regions, altering the structural properties of the mRNA. Although essential for development, the exact role of this editing is not fully understood 

==== Polyadenylation ====
Polyadenylation is the covalent linkage of a polyadenylyl moiety to a messenger RNA molecule. In eukaryotic organisms most messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules are polyadenylated at the 3&#x27; end, but recent studies have shown that short stretches of uridine (oligouridylation) are also common. The poly(A) tail and the protein bound to it aid in protecting mRNA from degradation by exonucleases. Polyadenylation is also important for transcription termination, export of the mRNA from the nucleus, and translation. mRNA can also be polyadenylated in prokaryotic organisms, where poly(A) tails act to facilitate, rather than impede, exonucleolytic degradation.

Polyadenylation occurs during and/or immediately after transcription of DNA into RNA. After transcription has been terminated, the mRNA chain is cleaved through the action of an endonuclease complex associated with RNA polymerase. After the mRNA has been cleaved, around 250 adenosine residues are added to the free 3&#x27; end at the cleavage site. This reaction is catalyzed by polyadenylate polymerase. Just as in alternative splicing, there can be more than one polyadenylation variant of an mRNA.

Polyadenylation site mutations also occur. The primary RNA transcript of a gene is cleaved at the poly-A addition site, and 100–200 A&#x27;s are added to the 3&#x27; end of the RNA. If this site is altered, an abnormally long and unstable mRNA construct will be formed.

===Transport===
Another difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes is mRNA transport. Because eukaryotic transcription and translation is compartmentally separated, eukaryotic mRNAs must be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm—a process that may be regulated by different signaling pathways. Mature mRNAs are recognized by their processed modifications and then exported through the nuclear pore by binding to the cap-binding proteins CBP20 and CBP80, as well as the transcription/export complex (TREX). Multiple mRNA export pathways have been identified in eukaryotes.

In spatially complex cells, some mRNAs are transported to particular subcellular destinations. In mature neurons, certain mRNA are transported from the soma to dendrites. One site of mRNA translation is at polyribosomes selectively localized beneath synapses. The mRNA for Arc/Arg3.1 is induced by synaptic activity and localizes selectively near active synapses based on signals generated by NMDA receptors. Other mRNAs also move into dendrites in response to external stimuli, such as β-actin mRNA. For export from the nucleus, actin mRNA associates with ZBP1 and later with 40S subunit. The complex is bound by a motor protein and is transported to the target location (neurite extension) along the cytoskeleton. Eventually ZBP1 is phosphorylated by Src in order for translation to be initiated. In developing neurons, mRNAs are also transported into growing axons and especially growth cones. Many mRNAs are marked with so-called &quot;zip codes&quot;, which target their transport to a specific location. mRNAs can also transfer between mammalian cells through structures called tunneling nanotubes.

===Translation===
Because prokaryotic mRNA does not need to be processed or transported, translation by the ribosome can begin immediately after the end of transcription. Therefore, it can be said that prokaryotic translation is &quot;coupled&quot; to transcription and occurs &quot;co-transcriptionally&quot;. 

Eukaryotic mRNA that has been processed and transported to the cytoplasm (i.e., mature mRNA) can then be translated by the ribosome. Translation may occur at ribosomes free-floating in the cytoplasm, or directed to the endoplasmic reticulum by the signal recognition particle. Therefore, unlike in prokaryotes, eukaryotic translation &quot;is not&quot; directly coupled to transcription. It is even possible in some contexts that reduced mRNA levels are accompanied by increased protein levels, as has been observed for mRNA/protein levels of EEF1A1 in breast cancer.

== Structure ==
=== Coding regions ===

Coding regions are composed of codons, which are decoded and translated into proteins by the ribosome; in eukaryotes usually into one and in prokaryotes usually into several. Coding regions begin with the start codon and end with a stop codon. In general, the start codon is an AUG triplet and the stop codon is UAG (&quot;amber&quot;), UAA (&quot;ochre&quot;), or UGA (&quot;opal&quot;). The coding regions tend to be stabilised by internal base pairs; this impedes degradation. In addition to being protein-coding, portions of coding regions may serve as regulatory sequences in the pre-mRNA as exonic splicing enhancers or exonic splicing silencers.

=== Untranslated regions ===
Untranslated regions (UTRs) are sections of the mRNA before the start codon and after the stop codon that are not translated, termed the five prime untranslated region (5&#x27; UTR) and three prime untranslated region (3&#x27; UTR), respectively. These regions are transcribed with the coding region and thus are exonic as they are present in the mature mRNA. Several roles in gene expression have been attributed to the untranslated regions, including mRNA stability, mRNA localization, and translational efficiency. The ability of a UTR to perform these functions depends on the sequence of the UTR and can differ between mRNAs. Genetic variants in 3&#x27; UTR have also been implicated in disease susceptibility because of the change in RNA structure and protein translation.

The stability of mRNAs may be controlled by the 5&#x27; UTR and/or 3&#x27; UTR due to varying affinity for RNA degrading enzymes called ribonucleases and for ancillary proteins that can promote or inhibit RNA degradation. (See also, C-rich stability element.)

Translational efficiency, including sometimes the complete inhibition of translation, can be controlled by UTRs. Proteins that bind to either the 3&#x27; or 5&#x27; UTR may affect translation by influencing the ribosome&#x27;s ability to bind to the mRNA. MicroRNAs bound to the 3&#x27; UTR also may affect translational efficiency or mRNA stability.

Cytoplasmic localization of mRNA is thought to be a function of the 3&#x27; UTR. Proteins that are needed in a particular region of the cell can also be translated there; in such a case, the 3&#x27; UTR may contain sequences that allow the transcript to be localized to this region for translation.

Some of the elements contained in untranslated regions form a characteristic secondary structure when transcribed into RNA. These structural mRNA elements are involved in regulating the mRNA. Some, such as the SECIS element, are targets for proteins to bind. One class of mRNA element, the riboswitches, directly bind small molecules, changing their fold to modify levels of transcription or translation. In these cases, the mRNA regulates itself.

===Poly(A) tail===

The 3&#x27; poly(A) tail is a long sequence of adenine nucleotides (often several hundred) added to the 3&#x27; end of the pre-mRNA. This tail promotes export from the nucleus and translation, and protects the mRNA from degradation.

=== Monocistronic versus polycistronic mRNA ===

An mRNA molecule is said to be monocistronic when it contains the genetic information to translate only a single protein chain (polypeptide). This is the case for most of the eukaryotic mRNAs. On the other hand, polycistronic mRNA carries several open reading frames (ORFs), each of which is translated into a polypeptide. These polypeptides usually have a related function (they often are the subunits composing a final complex protein) and their coding sequence is grouped and regulated together in a regulatory region, containing a promoter and an operator. Most of the mRNA found in bacteria and archaea is polycistronic, as is the human mitochondrial genome. Dicistronic or bicistronic mRNA encodes only two proteins.

=== mRNA circularization ===

In eukaryotes mRNA molecules form circular structures due to an interaction between the eIF4E and poly(A)-binding protein, which both bind to eIF4G, forming an mRNA-protein-mRNA bridge. Circularization is thought to promote cycling of ribosomes on the mRNA leading to time-efficient translation, and may also function to ensure only intact mRNA are translated (partially degraded mRNA characteristically have no m7G cap, or no poly-A tail).

Other mechanisms for circularization exist, particularly in virus mRNA. Poliovirus mRNA uses a cloverleaf section towards its 5&#x27; end to bind PCBP2, which binds poly(A)-binding protein, forming the familiar mRNA-protein-mRNA circle. Barley yellow dwarf virus has binding between mRNA segments on its 5&#x27; end and 3&#x27; end (called kissing stem loops), circularizing the mRNA without any proteins involved.

RNA virus genomes (the + strands of which are translated as mRNA) are also commonly circularized. During genome replication the circularization acts to enhance genome replication speeds, cycling viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase much the same as the ribosome is hypothesized to cycle.

==Degradation==
Different mRNAs within the same cell have distinct lifetimes (stabilities). In bacterial cells, individual mRNAs can survive from seconds to more than an hour. However, the lifetime averages between 1 and 3 minutes, making bacterial mRNA much less stable than eukaryotic mRNA. In mammalian cells, mRNA lifetimes range from several minutes to days. The greater the stability of an mRNA the more protein may be produced from that mRNA. The limited lifetime of mRNA enables a cell to alter protein synthesis rapidly in response to its changing needs. There are many mechanisms that lead to the destruction of an mRNA, some of which are described below.

===Prokaryotic mRNA degradation===

In general, in prokaryotes the lifetime of mRNA is much shorter than in eukaryotes. Prokaryotes degrade messages by using a combination of ribonucleases, including endonucleases, 3&#x27; exonucleases, and 5&#x27; exonucleases. In some instances, small RNA molecules (sRNA) tens to hundreds of nucleotides long can stimulate the degradation of specific mRNAs by base-pairing with complementary sequences and facilitating ribonuclease cleavage by RNase III. It was recently shown that bacteria also have a sort of 5&#x27; cap consisting of a triphosphate on the 5&#x27; end. Removal of two of the phosphates leaves a 5&#x27; monophosphate, causing the message to be destroyed by the exonuclease RNase J, which degrades 5&#x27; to 3&#x27;.

===Eukaryotic mRNA turnover===
Inside eukaryotic cells, there is a balance between the processes of translation and mRNA decay. Messages that are being actively translated are bound by ribosomes, the eukaryotic initiation factors eIF-4E and eIF-4G, and poly(A)-binding protein. eIF-4E and eIF-4G block the decapping enzyme (DCP2), and poly(A)-binding protein blocks the exosome complex, protecting the ends of the message. The balance between translation and decay is reflected in the size and abundance of cytoplasmic structures known as P-bodies. The poly(A) tail of the mRNA is shortened by specialized exonucleases that are targeted to specific messenger RNAs by a combination of cis-regulatory sequences on the RNA and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins. Poly(A) tail removal is thought to disrupt the circular structure of the message and destabilize the cap binding complex. The message is then subject to degradation by either the exosome complex or the decapping complex. In this way, translationally inactive messages can be destroyed quickly, while active messages remain intact. The mechanism by which translation stops and the message is handed-off to decay complexes is not understood in detail. The majority of mRNA decay was believed to be cytoplasmic; however, recently, a novel mRNA decay pathway was described, which starts in the nucleus.

===AU-rich element decay===
The presence of AU-rich elements in some mammalian mRNAs tends to destabilize those transcripts through the action of cellular proteins that bind these sequences and stimulate poly(A) tail removal. Loss of the poly(A) tail is thought to promote mRNA degradation by facilitating attack by both the exosome complex and the decapping complex. Rapid mRNA degradation via AU-rich elements is a critical mechanism for preventing the overproduction of potent cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). AU-rich elements also regulate the biosynthesis of proto-oncogenic transcription factors like c-Jun and c-Fos.

===Nonsense-mediated decay===
Eukaryotic messages are subject to surveillance by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), which checks for the presence of premature stop codons (nonsense codons) in the message. These can arise via incomplete splicing, V(D)J recombination in the adaptive immune system, mutations in DNA, transcription errors, leaky scanning by the ribosome causing a frame shift, and other causes. Detection of a premature stop codon triggers mRNA degradation by 5&#x27; decapping, 3&#x27; poly(A) tail removal, or endonucleolytic cleavage.

===Small interfering RNA (siRNA)===
In metazoans, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) processed by Dicer are incorporated into a complex known as the RNA-induced silencing complex or RISC. This complex contains an endonuclease that cleaves perfectly complementary messages to which the siRNA binds. The resulting mRNA fragments are then destroyed by exonucleases. siRNA is commonly used in laboratories to block the function of genes in cell culture. It is thought to be part of the innate immune system as a defense against double-stranded RNA viruses.

===MicroRNA (miRNA)===
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that typically are partially complementary to sequences in metazoan messenger RNAs. Binding of a miRNA to a message can repress translation of that message and accelerate poly(A) tail removal, thereby hastening mRNA degradation. The mechanism of action of miRNAs is the subject of active research.

===Other decay mechanisms===
There are other ways by which messages can be degraded, including non-stop decay and silencing by Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), among others.

== Applications ==

The administration of a nucleoside-modified messenger RNA sequence can cause a cell to make a protein, which in turn could directly treat a disease or could function as a vaccine; more indirectly the protein could drive an endogenous stem cell to differentiate in a desired way.

The primary challenges of RNA therapy center on delivering the RNA to the appropriate cells. Challenges include the fact that naked RNA sequences naturally degrade after preparation; they may trigger the body&#x27;s immune system to attack them as an invader; and they are impermeable to the cell membrane. Once within the cell, they must then leave the cell&#x27;s transport mechanism to take action within the cytoplasm, which houses the necessary ribosomes.

Overcoming these challenges, mRNA as a therapeutic was first put forward in 1989 &quot;after the development of a broadly applicable in vitro transfection technique.&quot; In the 1990s, mRNA vaccines for personalized cancer have been developed, relying on non-nucleoside modified mRNA. mRNA based therapies continue to be investigated as a method of treatment or therapy for both cancer as well as auto-immune, metabolic, and respiratory inflammatory diseases. Gene editing therapies such as CRISPR may also benefit from using mRNA to induce cells to make the desired Cas protein.

Since the 2010s, RNA vaccines and other RNA therapeutics have been considered to be &quot;a new class of drugs&quot;. The first mRNA-based vaccines received restricted authorization and were rolled out across the world during the COVID-19 pandemic by Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and Moderna, for example.
The 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman for the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19.

== History ==
Several molecular biology studies during the 1950s indicated that RNA played some kind of role in protein synthesis, but that role was not clearly understood. For instance, in one of the earliest reports, Jacques Monod and his team showed that RNA synthesis was necessary for protein synthesis, specifically during the production of the enzyme β-galactosidase in the bacterium &quot;E. coli&quot;. Arthur Pardee also found similar RNA accumulation in 1954&quot;.&quot; In 1953, Alfred Hershey, June Dixon, and Martha Chase described a certain cytosine-containing DNA (indicating it was RNA) that disappeared quickly after its synthesis in &quot;E. coli&quot;. In hindsight, this may have been one of the first observations of the existence of mRNA but it was not recognized at the time as such.

The idea of mRNA was first conceived by Sydney Brenner and Francis Crick on 15 April 1960 at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, while François Jacob was telling them about a recent experiment conducted by Arthur Pardee, himself, and Monod (the so-called PaJaMo experiment, which did not prove mRNA existed but suggested the possibility of its existence). With Crick&#x27;s encouragement, Brenner and Jacob immediately set out to test this new hypothesis, and they contacted Matthew Meselson at the California Institute of Technology for assistance. During the summer of 1960, Brenner, Jacob, and Meselson conducted an experiment in Meselson&#x27;s laboratory at Caltech which was the first to prove the existence of mRNA. That fall, Jacob and Monod coined the name &quot;messenger RNA&quot; and developed the first theoretical framework to explain its function.

In February 1961, James Watson revealed that his Harvard-based research group had been right behind them with a series of experiments whose results pointed in roughly the same direction. Brenner and the others agreed to Watson&#x27;s request to delay publication of their research findings. As a result, the Brenner and Watson articles were published simultaneously in the same issue of &quot;Nature&quot; in May 1961, while that same month, Jacob and Monod published their theoretical framework for mRNA in the &quot;Journal of Molecular Biology&quot;.

<text>Mount Saint Vincent University, often referred to as the Mount, is a public, primarily undergraduate, university located in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, and was established in 1873. Mount Saint Vincent offers undergraduate Arts, Science, Education, and Professional Studies undergraduate programs. The Mount has 13 graduate degrees in Applied Human Nutrition, School Psychology, Child and Youth Study, Education, Family Studies and Gerontology, Public Relations and Women&#x27;s Studies. The Mount offers a doctorate program and a Ph.D. in Educational Studies through a joint initiative with St. Francis Xavier University and Acadia University. The Mount offers over 190 courses, ten undergraduate degree programs, and four online graduate degree programs.

The university attracts many students partly because of its small class sizes, specialty programs, and location. The Mount has Canada Research Chairs in Gender Identity and Social Practices as well as Food Security and Policy Change. This institution is unique nationwide as it has a Chair in learning disabilities, a Master of Public Relations program, a Bachelor of Science in Communication Studies, and numerous other programs, faculty, and research initiatives.

==History==
Established by the Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul as a women&#x27;s college in 1873, the Mount was one of the few institutions of higher education for women in Canada at a time when women could not vote. The original purpose of the academy was to train novices and young sisters as teachers. Still, the Sisters also recognized a need to educate other young women. Over the ensuing years, the order developed a convent, schools, an orphanage, and health care facilities throughout the Halifax area and across North America. 

The Sisters of Charity Halifax, also staffed the Shubenacadie Residential School in Nova Scotia, which was open from 1930 to 1967, and the Cranbrook Residential School in British Columbia, which was open from 1890 to 1970. In October 2021, then-MSVU President Dr. Ramona Lumpkin apologized on behalf of the university to the survivors, their families and communities, as well as all Indigenous peoples, for the university’s role in the tragedy of residential schools in Canada.

Architect Charles Welsford West designed the Romanesque chapel and annex (1903–05) at Mount St. Vincent Academy (now the University). He was the Architect of Nova Scotia Public Works &amp; Mines 1932–1950.

By 1912, the Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul recognized the need to offer more significant opportunities through university education. They adopted a plan to establish a college for young women. Two years later, in 1914, the Sisters partnered with Dalhousie University, enabling Mount Saint Vincent to offer the first two years of a bachelor&#x27;s degree program to be credited toward a Dalhousie degree.

In 1925, the Nova Scotia Legislature awarded the Mount the right to grant degrees, making it the only independent women&#x27;s college in the British Commonwealth. By 1951, degrees were offered in Arts, Secretarial Science, Music, Home Economics, Library Science, Nursing and Education.

A new charter was granted in 1966, and the College became Mount Saint Vincent University, establishing a board of governors and senate. This was also a period of tremendous growth– with enrolment increases, new construction, and new agreements. In 1967, the Mount began admitting male students. The university continued to evolve with the expansion of programs during the 1970s and entered into several new fields, including Child Study, Public Relations, Gerontology, Tourism and Hospitality Management, Cooperative Education, and Distance Education. In July 1988, the Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul officially transferred ownership of the institution to the Board of Governors.

=== Caritas Day===

After a fire in 1951 burned down Mount Saint Vincent&#x27;s only building, the people of Halifax came together to support students by providing alternative accommodations for their classes. In recognition of the generosity of their community, the Sisters of Charity established a memorial holiday in appreciation of their gesture. Caritas Day, named after the Christian virtue of charity, takes place on the last Wednesday of January of each year. No classes are held on this day, and students are encouraged to volunteer their time instead. Caritas Day is an opportunity for students and faculty alike to connect with the Sisters of Charity and come together outside of class in a personally and academically beneficial setting.

==Programs==

Mount Saint Vincent University offers over 40 undergraduate arts, sciences, and professional studies degrees. Professional studies programs include Applied Human Nutrition, Business Administration, Child and Youth Study, Family Studies and Gerontology, Information Technology, Public Relations, Non-profit Leadership, and Tourism and Hospitality Management. All undergraduate programs are work-experience eligible, meaning any Mount student can participate in a work placement (practicum, co-op, internship) as part of their program.

The Mount also offers diplomas in Business Administration and tourism and hospitality Management and certificates in Accounting, Business Administration, Marketing, Proficiency in French, and Non-profit Leadership.

Following the consolidation of post-secondary programs across Nova Scotia in the 1990s, the Mount became home to the only education program in the Halifax area. The faculty of Education is home to the only school psychology graduate program in Atlantic Canada. Graduates of this program are eligible to become registered psychologists in Nova Scotia and several other provinces in Canada.

The Mount houses 16 research centres and institutes.

The Department of Applied Human Nutrition has an accredited dietetic program. The University is accredited by a professional organization such as the Dietitians of Canada, and the university&#x27;s graduates may subsequently become registered dietitians.

Mount Saint Vincent University is the only university in Canada to offer a Master of Public Relations program (MPR). The MPR program graduated its first class in October 2009. The Canadian Public Relations Society (CPRS) recognizes MSVU&#x27;s MPR program for excellence in PR education in its Pathways to the Profession guide.

=== Support services ===
Academic programs are supported by a wide variety of electronic and print research resources in the MSVU Library. Research services include drop-in reference assistance, research appointments, and classroom workshops.

January 2019 marked the 40th anniversary of the Mount&#x27;s co-operative education program. It is the longest-standing nationally accredited co-op program in the Maritime Provinces, offering an optional co-op program in 1979 for students in the Bachelor of Business Administration program. Four decades later, more than 8,000 Business Administration, Public Relations, and Tourism &amp; Hospitality Management students have taken their learning from the classroom to the workplace, completing paid work terms in industries related to their field of study (today, co-op is a required part of the Public Relations and Tourism &amp; Hospitality Management degrees). Since 2014, the Mount Co-op Office has also enabled experiential opportunities for Arts and Science students through an Arts &amp; Science Internship Program.

Mount Saint Vincent University is home to the Centre for Women in Business, a not-for-profit university business development centre (UBDC), dedicated to assisting with entrepreneurial activities within and throughout Nova Scotia. Founded in 1992 by the University&#x27;s Department of Business &amp; Tourism, this remains the only UBDC in Canada with a primary focus on women. The Centre has served more than 7500 clients over the past 18 years.

==Art Gallery==

The Mount Saint Vincent University Art Gallery is located on the first floor of Seton Academic Centre. It opened in 1971 as a resource for Mount Saint Vincent, the communities served by the university, artists, Metro Halifax residents, and the art public. Admission is always free of charge.

MSVU Art Gallery reflects the University&#x27;s educational aims by devoting a significant part of its activities to the representation of women as cultural subjects and producers. Its exhibitions explore various forms of cultural production, highlighting the achievements of Nova Scotian artists and themes relevant to academic programs offered by the university.

== Wikuom ==

The Mount was the first Nova Scotia university to add a wikuom to its campus facilities. First raised on June 12, 2017, the wikuom is a welcoming traditional Mi&#x27;kmaq space where Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities can gather and learn together.

The Mount is also home to the Aboriginal Student Centre (ASC), which is home to ASC staff who provide academic advising, counseling, and other support services to students. The ASC hosts several events, including the Mount&#x27;s Mid-Winter Feast, Blanket Exercises, Cultural Workshops, Mini-Mount Camps, and more.

==Athletics==

Home to the Mystics, the Mount competes in the Atlantic Colleges Athletic Association (ACAA) in Women&#x27;s &amp; Men&#x27;s Basketball, Women&#x27;s &amp; Men&#x27;s Soccer, Cross Country and Women&#x27;s Volleyball. The Mystics hold championship titles in all sports, making them the most acclaimed team of the ACAA division.

<doc id="20239" wikidata="Q815955" url="?curid=20239" title="Minimal pair">
<text>In phonology, minimal pairs are pairs of words or phrases in a particular language, spoken or signed, that differ in only one phonological element, such as a phoneme, toneme or chroneme, and have distinct meanings. They are used to demonstrate that two phones represent two separate phonemes in the language.

Many phonologists in the middle part of the 20th century had a strong interest in developing techniques for discovering the phonemes of unknown languages, and in some cases, they set up writing systems for the languages. The major work of Kenneth Pike on the subject is &quot;Phonemics: a technique for reducing languages to writing&quot;. The minimal pair was an essential tool in the discovery process and was found by substitution or commutation tests.

As an example for English vowels, the pair &quot;let&quot; + &quot;lit&quot; can be used to demonstrate that the phones (in let) and (in lit) actually represent distinct phonemes and . An example for English consonants is the minimal pair of &quot;pat&quot; + &quot;bat&quot;. The following table shows other pairs demonstrating the existence of various distinct phonemes in English. All of the possible minimal pairs for any language may be set out in the same way.

Phonemic differentiation may vary between different dialects of a language so a particular minimal pair in one accent may be a pair of homophones in another. That means not that one of the phonemes is absent in the homonym accent but only that it is not contrastive in the same range of contexts.

==Types==
In addition to the minimal pairs of vowels and consonants provided above, others may be found:

===Quantity===
Many languages show contrasts between long and short vowels and consonants. A distinctive difference in length is attributed by some phonologists to a unit called a chroneme. Thus, Italian has the following minimal pair that is based on long and short :

However, in such a case it is not easy to decide whether a long vowel or consonant should be treated as having an added chroneme or simply as a geminate sound with phonemes.

Classical Latin, German, some Italian dialects, almost all Uralic languages, Thai, and many other languages also have distinctive length in vowels. An example is the &quot;cŭ/cū&quot; minimal pair in the Italian dialect that is spoken near Palmi (Calabria, Italy):

====Syntactic gemination====
In some languages like Italian, word-initial consonants are geminated after certain vowel-final words in the same prosodic unit. Sometimes, the phenomenon can create some syntactic-gemination-minimal-pairs:
In the example, the graphical accent on &quot;dà&quot; is just a diacritical mark that does not change the pronunciation of the word itself. However, in some specific areas, like Tuscany, both phrases are pronounced and so can be distinguished only from the context.

===Tone===
Minimal pairs for tone contrasts in tone languages can be established; some writers refer to that as a contrast involving a toneme. For example, Kono, of Sierra Leone, distinguishes high tone and low tone on syllables:
===Stress===
Languages in which stress may occur in different positions within the word often have contrasts that can be shown in minimal pairs, as in Greek and Spanish:
In English stress can determine the part of speech of a word: &quot;insult&quot; as a noun is while as a verb it is . In certain cases it can also differentiate two words: &quot;below&quot; vs &quot;billow&quot; .

===Juncture===
Anglophones can distinguish between, for example, &quot;great ape&quot; and &quot;grey tape&quot;, but phonemically, the two phrases are identical: . The difference between the two phrases, which constitute a minimal pair, is said to be one of juncture. At the word boundary, a &quot;plus juncture&quot; /+/ has been posited and said to be the factor conditioning allophones to allow distinctivity: in this example, the phrase &quot;great ape&quot; has an diphthong shortened by pre-fortis clipping and, since it is not syllable-initial, a with little aspiration (variously , , , , etc., depending on dialect); meanwhile in &quot;grey tape&quot;, the has its full length and the is aspirated .

Only languages with allophonic differences associated with grammatical boundaries may have juncture as a phonological element. There is disagreement over whether or not French has phonological juncture: it seems likely that the difference between, for example, &quot; (some little holes) and &quot; (some little wheels), phonemically both , is only perceptible in slow, careful speech.

==Minimal sets==
The principle of a simple binary opposition between the two members of a minimal pair may be extended to cover a minimal set in which a number of words differ from one another in terms of one phone in a particular position in the word. For example, the vowels , , , , of Swahili are shown to be distinct by the following set of words:
&quot;pata&quot; &#x27;hinge&#x27;, &quot;peta&quot; &#x27;bend&#x27;, &quot;pita&quot; &#x27;pass&#x27;, &quot;pota&quot; &#x27;twist&#x27;, &quot;puta&quot; &#x27;thrash&#x27;. However, establishing such sets is not always straightforward and may require very complex study of multiple oppositions as expounded by, for example, Nikolai Trubetzkoy.

==Teaching==
Minimal pairs were an important part of the theory of pronunciation teaching during its development in the period of structuralist linguistics, particularly in the 1940s and 1950s, and minimal pair drills were widely used to train students to discriminate among the phonemes of the target language. These drills took the form of minimal pair word drills and minimal pair sentence drills. For example, if the focus of a lesson was on the distinction /ɪ/ versus /ɛ/, learners might be asked to signal which sound they heard as the teacher pronounced lists of words with these phonemes such as &quot;lid/led&quot;, &quot;tin/ten&quot;, or &quot;slipped/slept&quot;. Minimal pair sentence drills consisted of paired sentences such as &quot;He slipped on the floor/He slept on the floor.&quot; Again, learners would be asked to distinguish which of the sentences they heard as the teacher read them aloud. Another use of minimal pair drills was in pair work. Here, one member of the pair would be responsible for listening to the other member read the minimal pair word or sentence aloud and would be tasked with identifying which phoneme was being produced. In this form of classroom practice, both the skills of perception and production were practiced. Later writers have criticized the approach as being artificial and lacking in relevance to language learners&#x27; needs. However, even today minimal pair listening and production drills remain a common tool for the teaching of segmental differences.

Some writers have claimed that learners are likely not to hear differences between phones if the difference is not a phonemic one. One of the objectives of contrastive analysis of languages&#x27; sound systems was to identify points of likely difficulty for language learners that would arise from differences in phoneme inventories between the native language and the target language. However, experimental evidence for this claim is hard to find, and the claim should be treated with caution.

== In sign languages ==
In the past, signs were considered holistic forms without internal structure. However, the discovery in the mid-20th century that minimal pairs also exist in sign languages showed that sign languages have sublexical structure. Signs consist of phonemes, which are specifications for location, movement, handshape, orientation, and non-manual elements. When signs differ in only one of these specifications, they form a minimal pair. For instance, the German Sign Language signs shoes and socks are identical in form apart from their handshapes.

<doc id="20242" wikidata="Q581462" url="?curid=20242" title="Minestrone">
<text>Minestrone (, ) or minestrone di verdure is a thick soup of Italian origin based on vegetables. It typically includes onions, carrots, celery, potatoes, cabbage, tomatoes, often legumes, such as beans, chickpeas or fava beans, and sometimes pasta or rice. Minestrone traditionally is made without meat, but it has no precise recipe and can be made with many different ingredients.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;minestrone&quot;, meaning a thick vegetable soup, is attested in English from 1871. It is from Italian &quot;minestrone&quot;, the augmentative form of &quot;minestra&quot;, &#x27;soup&#x27;, or more literally &#x27;that which is served&#x27;, from &quot;minestrare&quot;, &#x27;to serve&#x27;, and cognate with &quot;administer&quot; as in &#x27;to administer a remedy&#x27;.

Because of its unique origins and the absence of a fixed recipe, minestrone varies widely across Italy depending on traditional cooking times, ingredients, and season. Minestrone ranges from a thick and dense texture with very boiled-down vegetables to a more brothy soup with large quantities of diced and lightly cooked vegetables; it may also include meats.

In modern Italian, there are three words corresponding to the English word &quot;soup&quot;: &quot;zuppa&quot;, which is used in the sense of tomato soup, or fish soup; &quot;minestra&quot;, which is used in the sense of a more substantial soup such as a vegetable soup, and also for &quot;dry&quot; soups, namely pasta dishes; and &quot;minestrone&quot;, which means a very substantial or large soup or stew, although the meaning has now come to be associated with this particular dish.

==History==
Some of the earliest origins of minestrone pre-date the expansion of the Latin tribes of Rome into what became the Roman Kingdom (later Roman Republic and Empire), when the local diet was &quot;vegetarian by necessity&quot; and consisted mostly of vegetables, such as onions, lentils, cabbage, garlic, fava beans, mushrooms, carrots, asparagus, and turnips.

During this time, the main dish of a meal would have been &quot;pulte&quot;, a simple but filling porridge of spelt flour cooked in salt water, to which whatever vegetables that were available would have been added.

It was not until the 2nd century BC, when Rome had conquered Italy and monopolized the commercial and road networks, that a huge diversity of products flooded the capital and began to change their diet, and by association, the diet of Italy, most notably with the more frequent inclusion of meats, including as a stock for soups.

Spelt flour was also removed from soups, as bread had been introduced into the Roman diet by the Greeks, and &quot;pulte&quot; became a meal largely for the poor.

The ancient Romans recognized the health benefits of a simple or &quot;frugal&quot; diet (from the Latin &quot;fruges&quot;, the common name given to cereals, vegetables and legumes) and thick vegetable soups and vegetables remained a staple.

Marcus Apicius&#x27;s ancient cookbook &quot;De Re Coquinaria&quot; described &quot;polus&quot;, a Roman soup dating back to 30 AD made of farro, chickpeas, and fava beans, with onions, garlic, lard, and greens thrown in.

As eating habits and ingredients changed in Italy, so did minestrone. Apicius updates the &quot;pultes&quot; and &quot;pulticulae&quot; with fancy trimmings such as cooked brains and wine.

The tradition of not losing rural roots continues today, and minestrone is now known in Italy as belonging to the style of cooking called &quot;cucina povera&quot; (&#x27;cuisine of the poor&#x27;), meaning dishes that have rustic, rural roots, as opposed to &quot;cucina nobile&quot; (&#x27;cuisine of the nobles&#x27;), or the cooking style of the aristocracy and nobles.

==Regional variations==
&quot;Minestrone alla genovese&quot; is a variant typical of Liguria which makes greater use of herbs, including pesto.

&quot;Imbakbaka&quot; or &quot;mbakbaka&quot; is a type of stew in Libya made with pasta, chickpeas, bzar spice, and meat. It originated through Italian colonization.

<text>Miranda, also designated Uranus V, is the smallest and innermost of Uranus&#x27;s five round satellites. It was discovered by Gerard Kuiper on 16 February 1948 at McDonald Observatory in Texas, and named after Miranda from William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Tempest&quot;. Like the other large moons of Uranus, Miranda orbits close to its planet&#x27;s equatorial plane. Because Uranus orbits the Sun on its side, Miranda&#x27;s orbit is nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic and shares Uranus&#x27;s extreme seasonal cycle.

At just in diameter, Miranda is one of the smallest closely observed objects in the Solar System that might be in hydrostatic equilibrium (spherical under its own gravity), and its total surface area is roughly equal to that of the U.S. state of Texas. The only close-up images of Miranda are from the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; probe, which made observations of Miranda during its Uranus flyby in January 1986. During the flyby, Miranda&#x27;s southern hemisphere pointed towards the Sun, so only that part was studied.

Miranda probably formed from an accretion disc that surrounded the planet shortly after its formation and, like other large moons, it is likely differentiated, with an inner core of rock surrounded by a mantle of ice. Miranda has one of the most extreme and varied topographies of any object in the Solar System, including Verona Rupes, a roughly scarp that may be the highest cliff in the Solar System, and chevron-shaped tectonic features called &quot;coronae&quot;. The origin and evolution of this varied geology, the most of any Uranian satellite, are still not fully understood, and multiple hypotheses exist regarding Miranda&#x27;s evolution.

== Discovery and name ==

Miranda was discovered on 16 February 1948 by planetary astronomer Gerard Kuiper using the McDonald Observatory&#x27;s Otto Struve Telescope. Its motion around Uranus was confirmed on 1 March 1948. It was the first satellite of Uranus discovered in nearly 100 years. Kuiper elected to name the object &quot;Miranda&quot; after the character in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;, because the four previously discovered moons of Uranus, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon, had all been named after characters of Shakespeare or Alexander Pope. However, the previous moons had been named specifically after fairies, whereas Miranda was a human. Subsequently discovered satellites of Uranus were named after characters from Shakespeare and Pope, whether fairies or not. The moon is also designated Uranus V.

== Orbit ==
Of Uranus&#x27;s five round satellites, Miranda orbits closest to it, at roughly 129 000 km from the surface; about a quarter again as far as its most distant ring. It is the round moon that has the smallest orbit around a major planet. Its orbital period is 34 hours and, like that of the Moon, is synchronous with its rotation period, which means it always shows the same face to Uranus, a condition known as tidal locking. Miranda&#x27;s orbital inclination (4.34°) is unusually high for a body so close to its planet – roughly ten times that of the other major Uranian satellites, and 73 times that of Oberon. The reason for this is still uncertain; there are no mean-motion resonances between the moons that could explain it, leading to the hypothesis that the moons occasionally pass through secondary resonances, which at some point in the past led to Miranda being locked for a time into a 3:1 resonance with Umbriel, before chaotic behaviour induced by the secondary resonances moved it out again. In the Uranian system, due to the planet&#x27;s lesser degree of oblateness and the larger relative size of its satellites, escape from a mean-motion resonance is much easier than for satellites of Jupiter or Saturn.

== Observation and exploration ==

Miranda&#x27;s apparent magnitude is +16.6, making it invisible to many amateur telescopes. Virtually all known information regarding its geology and geography was obtained during the flyby of Uranus made by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; on 25 January 1986, The closest approach of &quot;Voyager 2&quot; to Miranda was —significantly less than the distances to all other Uranian moons. Of all the Uranian satellites, Miranda had the most visible surface. The discovery team had expected Miranda to resemble Mimas, and found themselves at a loss to explain the moon&#x27;s unique geography in the 24-hour window before releasing the images to the press. In 2017, as part of its Planetary Science Decadal Survey, NASA evaluated the possibility of an orbiter to return to Uranus some time in the 2020s. Uranus was the preferred destination over Neptune due to favourable planetary alignments meaning shorter flight times.

== Composition and internal structure ==

At 1.15 g/cm3, Miranda is the least dense of Uranus&#x27;s round satellites. That density suggests a composition of more than 60% water ice. Miranda&#x27;s surface may be mostly water ice, though it is far rockier than its corresponding satellites in the Saturn system, indicating that heat from radioactive decay may have led to internal differentiation, allowing silicate rock and organic compounds to settle in its interior. Miranda is too small for any internal heat to have been retained over the age of the Solar System. Miranda is the least spherical of Uranus&#x27;s satellites, with an equatorial diameter 3% wider than its polar diameter. Only water has been detected so far on Miranda&#x27;s surface, though it has been speculated that methane, ammonia, carbon monoxide or nitrogen may also exist at 3% concentrations. These bulk properties are similar to Saturn&#x27;s moon Mimas, though Mimas is smaller, less dense, and more oblate. A study published in 2024 suggests that Miranda might have had a liquid ocean of about 100 km thickness beneath the surface within the last 100-500 million years. Some studies argue that Miranda may still possess a subsurface ocean.

Precisely how a body as small as Miranda could have enough internal energy to produce the myriad geological features seen on its surface has not been established with certainty, though the currently favoured hypothesis is that it was driven by tidal heating during a past time when it was in 3:1 orbital resonance with Umbriel. The resonance would have increased Miranda&#x27;s orbital eccentricity to 0.1, and generated tidal friction due to the varying tidal forces from Uranus. As Miranda approached Uranus, tidal force increased; as it retreated, tidal force decreased, causing flexing that would have warmed Miranda&#x27;s interior by 20 K, enough to trigger melting. The period of tidal flexing could have lasted for up to 100 million years. Also, if clathrate existed within Miranda, as has been hypothesised for the satellites of Uranus, it may have acted as an insulator, since it has a lower conductivity than water, increasing Miranda&#x27;s temperature still further. Miranda may have also once been in a 5:3 orbital resonance with Ariel, which would have also contributed to its internal heating. However, the maximum heating attributable to the resonance with Umbriel was likely about three times greater.

== Geography ==
Miranda has a unique surface. Among the geological structures that cover it are fractures, faults, valleys, craters, ridges, gorges, depressions, cliffs, and terraces. This moon is a mosaic of highly varied zones. Some areas are older and darker. As such, they bear numerous impact craters, as is expected of a small inert body. Other regions are made of rectangular or ovoid strips. They feature complex sets of parallel ridges and rupes (fault scarps) as well as numerous outcrops of bright and dark materials, suggesting an exotic composition. This moon is most likely composed only of water ice on the surface, as well as silicate rocks and other more or less buried organic compounds.

=== Regiones ===
The regiones identified on the images taken by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; probe are named &quot;Mantua Regio&quot;, &quot;Ephesus Regio&quot;, &quot;Sicilia Regio&quot;, and &quot;Dunsinane Regio&quot;. They designate major regions of Miranda where hilly terrain and plains follow one another, more or less dominated by ancient impact craters. Normal faults also mark these ancient regions. Some escarpments are as old as the formation of the regions while others are much more recent and appear to have formed after the coronae. These faults are accompanied by grabens characteristic of ancient tectonic activity. The surface of these regions is fairly uniformly dark. However, the cliffs bordering certain impact craters reveal, at depth, the presence of much more luminous material.

=== Coronae ===

Miranda is one of very few objects in the Solar system to have crowns (also called coronae). The three known coronae observed on Miranda are named Inverness Corona near the south pole, Arden Corona at the apex of the moon&#x27;s orbital motion, and Elsinore Corona at the antapex. The highest albedo contrasts on Miranda&#x27;s surface occur within the Inverness and Arden coronae.

==== Inverness Corona ====

Inverness Corona is a trapezoidal region of approximately on a side which lies near the south pole. This region is characterized by a central geological structure which takes the shape of a luminous chevron, a surface with a relatively high albedo, and a series of gorges which extend northwards from a point near the pole. At a latitude of around −55°, north-south oriented gorges tend to intersect with others, which follow an east-west direction. The outer boundary of Inverness, as well as its internal patterns of ridges and bands of contrasting albedos, form numerous salient angles. It is bounded on three sides (south, east and north) by a complex system of faults. The nature of the west coast is less clear, but may also be tectonic. Within the crown, the surface is dominated by parallel gorges spaced a few kilometers apart. The low number of impact craters indicates that Inverness is the youngest among the three coronae observed on the surface of Miranda.

==== Arden Corona ====
Arden Corona, present in the front hemisphere of Miranda, extends over approximately from east to west. The other dimension, however, remains unknown because the terrain extended beyond the terminator (on the hemisphere plunged into night) when &quot;Voyager 2&quot; photographed it. The outer margin of this corona forms parallel and dark bands which surround in gentle curves a more clearly rectangular core at least wide. The overall effect has been described as an ovoid of lines. The interior and belt of Arden show very different morphologies. The interior topography appears regular and soft. It is also characterized by a mottled pattern resulting from large patches of relatively bright material scattered over a generally dark surface. The stratigraphic relationship between the light and dark marks could not be determined from the images provided by &quot;Voyager 2&quot;. The area at the margin of Arden is characterized by concentric albedo bands which extend from the western end of the crown where they intersect crateriform terrain (near 40° longitude) and on the side east, where they extend beyond the, in the northern hemisphere (near 110° longitude). The contrasting albedo bands are composed of outer fault scarp faces. This succession of escarpments gradually pushes the land into a deep hollow along the border between Arden and the crateriform terrain called Mantua Regio. Arden was formed during a geological episode which preceded the formation of Inverness but which is contemporary with the formation of Elsinore.

==== Elsinore Corona ====
Elsinore Corona is the third corona, which was observed in the rear hemisphere of Miranda, along the terminator. It is broadly similar to Arden in size and internal structure. They both have an outer belt about wide, which wraps around an inner core. The topography of the core of Elsinore consists of a complex set of intersections of troughs and bumps which are truncated by this outer belt which is marked by roughly concentric linear ridges. The troughs also include small segments of rolling, cratered terrain. Elsinore also presents segments of furrows, called &quot;&quot;sulcus&quot;, comparable to those observed on Ganymede.

=== Rupes ===
Miranda also features enormous escarpments that can be traced across the moon. Some of them are older than the coronae, others younger. The most spectacular fault system begins at a deep valley visible at the terminator.

This network of faults begins on the northwest side of Inverness where it forms a deep gorge on the outer edge of the ovoid which surrounds the crown. This geological formation is named &quot;Argier Rupes&quot;&quot;.

The most impressive fault then extends to the terminator, extending from the top of the central &quot;chevron&quot; of Inverness. Near the terminator, a gigantic luminous cliff, named Verona Rupes, forms complex grabens. The fault is approximately wide, the graben at the bright edge is 10 to deep. The height of the sheer cliff is 5 to . Although it could not be observed by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; probe on the face immersed in the polar night of Miranda, it is probable that this geological structure extends beyond the terminator in the northern hemisphere.

=== Impact craters ===
During the close flyby of &quot;Voyager 2&quot; in January 1986, only the craters on the southern hemisphere of Miranda could be observed. They generally had diameters of over , representing the limit of resolution of the digital images transmitted by the probe during its flight. These craters have very varied morphologies. Some have well-defined borders and are sometimes surrounded by ejecta deposits characteristic of impact craters. Others are very degraded and sometimes barely recognizable, as their topography has been altered. The age of a crater does not give an indication of the date of formation of the terrain it marked. On the other hand, this date depends on the number of craters present on a site, regardless of their age. The more impact craters a terrain has, the older it is. Scientists use these as &quot;planetary chronometers&quot;; they count observed craters to date the formation of the terrain of inert natural satellites devoid of atmospheres, such as Callisto.

No multiple ring crater, nor any complex crater with a central peak, has been observed on Miranda. Simple craters, that is to say whose cavity is bowl-shaped, and transitional craters (with a flat bottom) are the norm, with their diameter not correlated to their shape. Thus simple craters of more than are observed while elsewhere transitional craters of have been identified. Ejecta deposits are rare, and are never associated with craters larger than in diameter. The ejecta that sometimes surround craters with a diameter less than appear systematically brighter than the material surrounding them. On the other hand, ejecta associated with craters of size between and are generally darker than what surrounds them (the albedo of the ejecta is lower than that of the matter surrounding them). Finally, some ejecta deposits, associated with diameters of all sizes, have an albedo comparable to that of the material on which they rest.

==== In regiones ====
In some regiones, and particularly in those of the visible part of the anti-Uranian hemisphere (which continually turns its back on the planet), craters are very frequent. They are sometimes stuck to each other with very little space between each one. Elsewhere, craters are less frequent and are separated by large, weakly undulated surfaces. The rim of many craters is surrounded by luminous material while streaks of dark material are observed on the walls which surround the bottom of the craters. In Matuna Regio, between the craters Truncilo and Fransesco, there is a gigantic circular geological structure of in diameter which could be a basin impact very significantly degraded. These findings suggest that these regions contain a shiny material at shallow depth, while a layer of dark material (or a material which darkens upon contact with the external environment) is present, at greater depth.

==== In coronae ====
Craters are statistically up to ten times less numerous in the coronae than in the anti-Uranian regions, which indicates that these formations are younger.

The density of impact craters could be established for different areas of Inverness, and made it possible to establish the age of each. Considering these measurements, the entire geological formation was formed in a relative unit of time. However, other observations make it possible to establish that the youngest zone, within this crown, is the one which separates the &quot;chevron&quot;, from Argier Rupes.

The density of impact craters in the core and in the Arden belt is statistically similar. The two distinct parts of this formation must therefore have been part of a common geological episode. Nevertheless, the superposition of craters on bands of the central core of Arden indicates that its formation preceded that of the scarps which surround it. The data from the impact craters can be interpreted as follows: the interior and marginal zones of the corona, including most of the albedo bands, were formed during the same period of time. Their formation was followed by later tectonic developments which produced the high-relief fault scarps observed along the edge of the crown near longitude 110°.

The density of impact craters seems the same in the structure surrounding Elsinore as in its central core. The two zones of the crown seem to have formed during the same geological period, but other geological elements suggest that the perimeter of Elsinore is younger than its core.

==== Other observations ====
The number of craters should be higher in the hemisphere at the apex of the orbital movement than at the antapex. However, it is the anti-Uranian hemisphere which is densest in craters. This situation could be explained by a past event having caused a reorientation of Miranda&#x27;s axis of rotation by 90° compared to that which is currently known. In this case, the paleoapex hemisphere of the moon would have become the current anti-Uranian hemisphere. However, the count of impact craters being limited to the southern hemisphere only, illuminated during the passage of the Voyager 2 probe, it is possible that Miranda has experienced a more complex reorientation and that its paleoapex is located somewhere in the northern hemisphere, which has not yet been photographed.

== Origin and formation ==
Several scenarios are proposed to explain its formation and geological evolution. One of them postulates that it would result from the accretion of a disk of gas and dust called a &quot;subnebula&quot;. This sub-nebula either existed around Uranus for some period of time after its formation, or was created following a cosmic impact which would have given its great obliquity to the axis of rotation of Uranus. However, this relatively small moon has areas that are surprisingly young compared to the geological time scale. It seems that the most recent geological formations only date back a few hundred million years. However, thermal models applicable to moons the size of Miranda predict rapid cooling and the absence of geological evolution following its accretion from the subnebula. Geological activity over such a long period cannot be justified either by the heat resulting from the initial accretion, nor by the heat generated by the fission of radioactive materials involved in the formation.

Miranda has the youngest surface among those of the satellites of the Uranian system, which indicates that its geography has undergone the most important evolutions. This geography would be explained by a complex geological history including a still unknown combination of different astronomical phenomena. Among these phenomena would be tidal forces, mechanisms of orbital resonances, processes of partial differentiation, or even movements of convection.

The geological patchwork could be partly the result of a catastrophic collision with an impactor. This event may have completely dislocated Miranda. The different pieces would then have re-assembled, then gradually reorganized in the spherical form that the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; probe photographed. Some scientists even speak of several cycles of collision and re-accretion of the moon. This geological hypothesis was depreciated in 2011 in favor of hypotheses involving Uranian tidal forces. These would have pulled and turned the materials present under Inverness and Arden to create fault scarps. The stretching and distortion caused by Uranus&#x27;s gravity, which alone could have provided the heat source necessary to power these uprisings.

The oldest known regions on the surface of Miranda are cratered plains such as Sicilia Regio and Ephesus Regio. The formation of these terrains follows the accretion of the moon then its cooling. The bottoms of the oldest craters are thus partially covered with material from the depths of the moon referred to as endogenous resurfacing, which was a surprising observation. The geological youth of Miranda demonstrates that a heat source then took over from the initial heat provided by the accretion of the moon. The most satisfactory explanation for the origin of the heat which animated the moon is the one which also explains the volcanism on Io: a situation of orbital resonance now on Miranda and the important phenomenon of tidal forces generated by Uranus.

After this first geological epoch, Miranda experienced a period of cooling which generated an overall extension of its core and produced fragments and cracks of its mantle on the surface, in the form of grabens. It is indeed possible that Miranda, Ariel, and Umbriel participated in several important resonances involving the pairs Miranda/Ariel, Ariel/Umbriel, and Miranda/Umbriel. Unlike those observed on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Io, these orbital resonance phenomena between Miranda and Ariel could not lead to a stable capture of the small moon. Instead of being captured, Miranda&#x27;s orbital resonance with Ariel and Umbriel may have led to the increase in its eccentricity and orbital inclination. By successively escaping several orbital resonances, Miranda alternated phases of heating and cooling. Thus all the known grabens of Miranda were not formed during this second geological episode.

A third major geological epoch occurs with the orbital reorientation of Miranda and the formation of Elsinore and Arden coronae. A singular volcanic event, made of flows of solid materials, could then to have taken place, within the coronae in formation. Another explanation proposed for the formation of these two coronae would be the product of a diapir which would have formed in the heart of the moon. On this occasion Miranda would have at least partially differentiated. Considering the size and position of these coronae, it is possible that their formation contributed to changing the moment of inertia of the moon. This could have caused a 90° reorientation of Miranda. Doubt remains as to the concomitant existence of these two formations. It is possible that at this time, the moon was distorted to the point that its asphericity and eccentricity temporarily caused it to undergo a chaotic rotational movement, such as that observed on Hyperion. If Miranda&#x27;s orbital reorientation occurred before the two coronae formed on the surface, then Elsinore would be older than Arden. Chaotic movement phenomena generated by the entry into 3:1 resonance between the orbit of Miranda and that of Umbriel could have contributed to an increase in Miranda&#x27;s orbital inclination greater than 3°.

A final geological episode consists of the formation of Inverness which seems to have induced surface tensions which gave rise to the creation of additional grabens including Verona Rupes and Argier Rupes. Following this new cooling of Miranda, its total volume could have increased by 4%. It is probable that these different geological episodes followed one another without interruption.

Ultimately, Miranda&#x27;s geological history may have spanned a period of more than 3 billion years. It would have started 3.5 billion years ago with the appearance of heavily cratered regions and ended a few hundred million years ago, with the formation of the coronae.

The phenomena of orbital resonances, and mainly that associated with Umbriel, but also, to a lesser extent, that of Ariel, would have had a significant impact on the orbital eccentricity of Miranda, and would also have contributed to the internal heating and geological activity of the moon. The whole would have induced convection movements in its substrate and allowed the start of planetary differentiation. At the same time, these phenomena would have only slightly disturbed the orbits of the other moons involved, which are more massive than Miranda. However, Miranda&#x27;s surface may appear too tortured to be the sole product of orbital resonance phenomena.

After Miranda escaped from this resonance with Umbriel, through a mechanism that likely moved the moon into its current, abnormally high orbital tilt, the eccentricity would have been reduced. The tidal forces would then have erased the eccentricity and the temperature at the heart of the moon. This would have allowed it to regain a spherical shape, without allowing it to erase the impressive geological artifacts such as Verona Rupes. This eccentricity being the source of the tidal forces, its reduction would have deactivated the heat source which fueled the ancient geological activity of Miranda, making it a cold and inert moon.

<text>Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, has appeared as a setting in works of fiction since at least the mid-1600s. Trends in the planet&#x27;s portrayal have largely been influenced by advances in planetary science. It became the most popular celestial object in fiction in the late 1800s, when it became clear that there was no life on the Moon. The predominant genre depicting Mars at the time was utopian fiction. Around the same time, the mistaken belief that there are canals on Mars emerged and made its way into fiction, popularized by Percival Lowell&#x27;s speculations of an ancient civilization having constructed them. &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, H. G. Wells&#x27;s novel about an alien invasion of Earth by sinister Martians, was published in 1897 and went on to have a major influence on the science fiction genre.

Life on Mars appeared frequently in fiction throughout the first half of the 1900s. Apart from enlightened as in the utopian works from the turn of the century, or evil as in the works inspired by Wells, intelligent and human-like Martians began to be depicted as decadent, a portrayal that was popularized by Edgar Rice Burroughs in the &quot;Barsoom&quot; series and adopted by Leigh Brackett among others. More exotic lifeforms appeared in stories like Stanley G. Weinbaum&#x27;s &quot;A Martian Odyssey&quot;.

The theme of colonizing Mars replaced stories about native inhabitants of the planet in the second half of the 1900s following emerging evidence of the planet being inhospitable to life, eventually confirmed by data from Mars exploration probes. A significant minority of works persisted in portraying Mars in a nostalgic way that was by then scientifically outdated, including Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;.

Terraforming Mars to enable human habitation has been another major theme, especially in the final quarter of the century, the most prominent example being Kim Stanley Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Mars&quot; trilogy. Stories of the first human mission to Mars appeared throughout the 1990s in response to the Space Exploration Initiative, and near-future exploration and settlement became increasingly common themes following the launches of other Mars exploration probes in the latter half of the decade. In the year 2000, science fiction scholar Gary Westfahl estimated the total number of works of fiction dealing with Mars up to that point to exceed five thousand, and the planet has continued to make frequent appearances across several genres and forms of media since. In contrast, the moons of Mars—Phobos and Deimos—have made only sporadic appearances in fiction.

== Early depictions ==

Before the 1800s, Mars did not get much attention in fiction writing as a primary setting, though it did appear in some stories visiting multiple locations in the Solar System. The first fictional tour of the planets, the 1656 work &quot;Itinerarium exstaticum&quot; by Athanasius Kircher, portrays Mars as a volcanic wasteland. It also appears briefly in the 1686 work &quot;Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes&quot; (&quot;Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds&quot;) by Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle but is largely dismissed as uninteresting due to its presumed similarity to Earth. Mars is home to spirits in several works of the mid-1700s. In the anonymously published 1755 work &quot;A Voyage to the World in the Centre of the Earth&quot;, it is a heavenly place where, among others, Alexander the Great enjoys a second life. In the 1758 work &quot;De Telluribus in Mundo Nostro Solari&quot; (&quot;Concerning the Earths in Our Solar System&quot;) by Emanuel Swedenborg, the planet is inhabited by beings characterized by honesty and moral virtue. In the 1765 novel &quot;Voyage de Milord Céton dans les sept planètes&quot; (&quot;The Voyages of Lord Seaton to the Seven Planets&quot;) by Marie-Anne de Roumier-Robert, reincarnated soldiers roam a war-torn landscape. It later appeared alongside the other planets throughout the 1800s. In the anonymously published 1839 novel &quot;A Fantastical Excursion into the Planets&quot;, it is divided between the Roman gods Mars and Vulcan. In the anonymously published 1873 novel &quot;A Narrative of the Travels and Adventures of Paul Aermont among the Planets&quot;, it is culturally rather similar to Earth—unlike the other planets. In the 1883 novel &quot;Aleriel, or A Voyage to Other Worlds&quot; by W. S. Lach-Szyrma, a visitor from Venus relates the details of Martian society to Earthlings. The first work of science fiction set primarily on Mars was the 1880 novel &quot;Across the Zodiac&quot; by Percy Greg.

Mars became the most popular extraterrestrial location in fiction in the late 1800s as it became clear that the Moon was devoid of life. A recurring theme in this time period was that of reincarnation on Mars, reflecting an upswing in interest in the paranormal in general and in relation to Mars in particular. Humans are reborn on Mars in the 1889 novel &quot;Uranie&quot; by Camille Flammarion as a form of afterlife, the 1896 novel &quot;Daybreak: The Story of an Old World&quot; by depicts Jesus reincarnated there, and the protagonist of the 1903 novel &quot;The Certainty of a Future Life in Mars&quot; by receives a message in Morse code from his deceased father on Mars. Other supernatural phenomena include telepathy in Greg&#x27;s &quot;Across the Zodiac&quot; and precognition in the 1886 short story &quot;The Blindman&#x27;s World&quot; by Edward Bellamy. 

Several recurring tropes were introduced during this time. One of them is Mars having a different local name such as Glintan in the 1889 novel &quot;Mr. Stranger&#x27;s Sealed Packet&quot; by Hugh MacColl, Oron in the 1892 novel &quot;Messages from Mars, By Aid of the Telescope Plant&quot; by Robert D. Braine, and Barsoom in the 1912 novel &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; by Edgar Rice Burroughs. This carried on in later works such as the 1938 novel &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; by C. S. Lewis, which calls the planet Malacandra. Several stories also depict Martians speaking Earth languages and provide explanations of varying levels of preposterousness. In the 1899 novel &quot;Pharaoh&#x27;s Broker&quot; by , Martians speak Hebrew as Mars goes through the same historical phases as Earth with a delay of a few thousand years, here corresponding to the captivity of the Israelites in Biblical Egypt. In the 1901 novel &quot;A Honeymoon in Space&quot; by George Griffith, they speak English because they acknowledge it as the &quot;most convenient&quot; language of all. In the 1920 novel &quot;A Trip to Mars&quot; by Marcianus Rossi, the Martians speak Latin as a result of having been taught the language by a Roman who was flung into space by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in the year 79. Martians were often portrayed as existing within a racial hierarchy: the 1894 novel &quot;Journey to Mars&quot; by Gustavus W. Pope features Martians with different skin colours (red, blue, and yellow) subject to strict anti-miscegenation laws, Rossi&#x27;s &quot;A Trip to Mars&quot; sees one portion of the Martian population described as &quot;our inferior race, the same as your terrestrian negroes&quot;, and Burroughs&#x27;s &quot;Barsoom&quot; series has red, green, yellow, and black Martians, a white race—responsible for the previous advanced civilization on Mars—having become extinct.

=== Means of travel ===

The question of how humans would get to Mars was addressed in several ways: when not travelling there via spaceship as in the 1911 novel &quot;To Mars via the Moon: An Astronomical Story&quot; by Mark Wicks, they might use a flying carpet as in the 1905 novel &quot;Lieut. Gullivar Jones: His Vacation&quot; by Edwin Lester Arnold, a balloon as in &quot;A Narrative of the Travels and Adventures of Paul Aermont among the Planets&quot;, or an &quot;aeroplane&quot; as in the 1893 novel &quot;Unveiling a Parallel: A Romance&quot; by Alice Ilgenfritz Jones and (writing jointly as &quot;Two Women of the West&quot;). They might also visit in a dream as in the 1899 play &quot;A Message from Mars&quot; by Richard Ganthony, teleport via astral projection as in Burroughs&#x27;s &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot;, or use a long-range communication device while staying on Earth as in Braine&#x27;s &quot;Messages from Mars, By Aid of the Telescope Plant&quot; and the 1894 novel &quot;W nieznane światy&quot; (&quot;To the Unknown Worlds&quot;) by Polish science fiction writer Władysław Umiński. Anti-gravity is employed in several works including Greg&#x27;s &quot;Across the Zodiac&quot;, MacColl&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Stranger&#x27;s Sealed Packet&quot;, and the 1890 novel &quot;A Plunge into Space&quot; by Robert Cromie. Occasionally, the method of transport is not addressed at all. Some stories take the opposite approach of having Martians come to Earth; examples include the 1891 novel &quot;The Man from Mars: His Morals, Politics and Religion&quot; by Thomas Blot (pseudonym of William Simpson) and the 1893 novel &quot;A Cityless and Countryless World&quot; by Henry Olerich.

=== Canals ===
During the opposition of Mars in 1877, Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli announced the discovery of linear structures he dubbed (literally &quot;channels&quot;, but widely translated as &quot;canals&quot;) on the Martian surface. These were generally interpreted—by those who accepted their disputed existence—as waterways, and they made their earliest appearance in fiction in the anonymously published 1883 novel &quot;Politics and Life in Mars&quot;, where the Martians live in the water. Schiaparelli&#x27;s observations, and perhaps the translation of as &quot;canals&quot; rather than &quot;channels&quot;, inspired Percival Lowell to speculate that these were artificial constructs and write a series of non-fiction books—&quot;Mars&quot; in 1895, &quot;Mars and Its Canals&quot; in 1906, and &quot;Mars as the Abode of Life&quot; in 1908—popularizing the idea. Lowell posited that Mars was home to an ancient and advanced but dying or already dead Martian civilization who had constructed these vast canals for irrigation to survive on an increasingly arid planet, and this became an enduring vision of Mars that influenced writers across several decades. Science fiction scholar Gary Westfahl, drawing from the catalogue of early science fiction works compiled by E. F. Bleiler and Richard Bleiler in the reference works &quot;Science-Fiction: The Early Years&quot; from 1990 and &quot;Science-Fiction: The Gernsback Years&quot; from 1998, concludes that Lowell thus &quot;effectively set the boundaries for subsequent narratives about an inhabited Mars&quot;.

Canals became a feature of romantic portrayals of Mars such as Burroughs&#x27;s &quot;Barsoom&quot; series. Early works that did not depict any waterways on Mars typically explained the appearance of straight lines on the surface in some other way, such as simooms or large tracts of vegetation. Although they quickly fell out of favour as a serious scientific theory, largely as a result of higher-quality telescopic observations by astronomers such as E. M. Antoniadi failing to detect them, canals continued to make sporadic appearances in fiction for a while in works such as the 1936 novel &quot;Planet Plane&quot; by John Wyndham, the 1938 novel &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; by C. S. Lewis, and the 1949 novel &quot;Red Planet&quot; by Robert A. Heinlein. Said Lewis in response to criticism from biologist J. B. S. Haldane, &quot;The canals in Mars are there not because I believe in them but because they are part of the popular tradition.&quot; Eventually, the flyby of Mars by Mariner 4 in 1965 conclusively determined that the canals were mere optical illusions.

=== Utopias ===

Because early versions of the nebular hypothesis of Solar System formation held that the planets were formed sequentially starting at the outermost planets, some authors envisioned Mars as an older and more mature world than the Earth, and it became the setting for many utopian works of fiction. This genre made up the majority of stories about Mars in the late 1800s and continued to be represented through the early 1900s. The earliest of these works was the 1880 novel &quot;Across the Zodiac&quot; by Percy Greg. The 1887 novel &quot;Bellona&#x27;s Husband: A Romance&quot; by William James Roe portrays a Martian society where everyone ages backwards. The 1890 novel &quot;A Plunge into Space&quot; by Robert Cromie depicts a society that is so advanced that life there has become dull and, as a result, the humans who visit succumb to boredom and leave ahead of schedule—to the approval of the Martians, who have come to view them as a corrupting influence. The 1892 novel &quot;Messages from Mars, By Aid of the Telescope Plant&quot; by Robert D. Braine is unusual in portraying a completely rural Martian utopia without any cities. An early work of feminist science fiction, Jones&#x27;s and Merchant&#x27;s 1893 novel &quot;Unveiling a Parallel: A Romance&quot;, depicts a man from Earth visiting two egalitarian societies on Mars: one where women have adopted male vices and one where equality has brought out everyone&#x27;s best qualities. The 1897 novel &quot;Auf zwei Planeten&quot; (&quot;Two Planets&quot;) by German science fiction pioneer Kurd Lasswitz contrasts a utopian society on Mars with that society&#x27;s colonialist actions on Earth. The book was translated into several languages and was highly influential in Continental Europe, including inspiring rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, but did not receive a translation into English until the 1970s, which limited its impact in the Anglosphere. The 1910 novel &quot;The Man from Mars, Or Service for Service&#x27;s Sake&quot; by portrays a civilization on Mars based on a variation on Christianity where woman was created first, in contrast to the conventional Genesis creation narrative. Hugo Gernsback depicted a science-based utopia on Mars in the 1915–1917 serial &quot;Baron Münchhausen&#x27;s New Scientific Adventures&quot;, but by and large, World War I spelled the end for utopian Martian fiction.

In Russian science fiction, Mars became the setting for socialist utopias and revolutions. The 1908 novel &quot;Red Star&quot; (&quot;Красная звезда&quot;) by Alexander Bogdanov is the primary example of this, and inspired many others. &quot;Red Star&quot; portrays a socialist society on Mars from the perspective of a Russian Bolshevik invited there, where the struggle between classes has been replaced with a common struggle against the harshness of nature. The 1913 prequel &quot;Engineer Menni&quot; (&quot;Инженер Мэнни&quot;), also by Bogdanov, is set several centuries earlier and serves as an origin story for the Martian society by detailing the events of the revolution that brought it about. Another prominent example is the 1922 novel &quot;Aelita&quot; (&quot;Аэлита&quot;) by Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy—along with its 1924 film adaptation, the earliest Soviet science fiction film—which adapts the story of the 1905 Russian Revolution to the Martian surface. &quot;Red Star&quot; and &quot;Aelita&quot; are in some ways opposites. &quot;Red Star&quot;, written between the failed revolution in 1905 and the successful 1917 Russian Revolution, sees Mars as a socialist utopia from which Earth can learn, whereas in &quot;Aelita&quot; the socialist revolution is instead exported from the early Soviet Russia to Mars. &quot;Red Star&quot; depicts a utopia on Mars, in contrast to the dystopia initially found on Mars in &quot;Aelita&quot;—though both are technocracies. &quot;Red Star&quot; is a sincere and idealistic work of traditional utopian fiction, whereas &quot;Aelita&quot; is a parody.

=== &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; ===

The 1897 novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; by H. G. Wells, which depicts an alien invasion of Earth by Martians in search of resources, represented a turning point in Mars fiction. Rather than being portrayed as essentially human, Wells&#x27;s Martians have a completely inhuman appearance and cannot be communicated with. Rather than being noble creatures to emulate, the Martians dispassionately kill and exploit the Earthlings like livestock—a critique of contemporary British colonialism in general and its devastating effects on the Aboriginal Tasmanians in particular. The novel set the tone for the majority of the science-fictional depictions of Mars in the decades that followed in portraying the Martians as malevolent and Mars as a dying world. Beyond Martian fiction, the novel had a large influence on the broader science fiction genre, and inspired rocket scientist Robert H. Goddard. According to science fiction essayist Bud Webster, &quot;It&#x27;s impossible to overstate the importance of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; and the influence it&#x27;s had over the years.&quot; 
An unauthorized sequel—&quot;Edison&#x27;s Conquest of Mars&quot; by Garrett P. Serviss—was released in 1898, as was a parody by and E. V. Lucas titled &quot;&quot;. Wells&#x27;s story gained further notoriety in 1938 when a radio adaptation by Orson Welles in the style of a news broadcast was mistaken for a real newscast by some listeners in the US, leading to panic; less famously, a 1949 broadcast in Quito, Ecuador, also resulted in a riot. Several sequels and adaptations by other authors have been written since, including the 1950 Superman comic book story &quot;Black Magic on Mars&quot; by Alvin Schwartz and Wayne Boring where Orson Welles tries to warn Earth of an impending Martian invasion but is dismissed, the 1968 novel &quot;The Second Invasion from Mars&quot; (&quot;Второе нашествие марсиан&quot;) by Soviet science fiction writers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky where the Martians forgo military conquest in favour of infiltration, the 1975 novel &quot;Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s War of the Worlds&quot; by Manly Wade Wellman and and the 1976 novel &quot;The Second War of the Worlds&quot; by George H. Smith which both combine Wells&#x27;s story with Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes characters, the 1976 novel &quot;The Space Machine&quot; by Christopher Priest which combines the story of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; with that of Wells&#x27;s 1895 novel &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, the 2002 short story &quot;Ulla, Ulla&quot; by Eric Brown which reframes the invasion as a desperate escape by a peaceful race from a dying world, and the 2005 novel &quot;The Martian War&quot; by Kevin J. Anderson where Wells himself goes to Mars and instigates a slave uprising. The authorized 2017 sequel novel &quot;The Massacre of Mankind&quot; by Stephen Baxter is set in 1920 in an alternate timeline where the events of the original novel caused World War I never to happen by making Britain war-weary and isolationist, and the Martians attack yet again after inoculating themselves against the microbes that were their downfall the first time.

== Life on Mars ==
The term &quot;Martians&quot; typically refers to inhabitants of Mars that are similar to humans in terms of having such things as language and civilization, though it is also occasionally used to refer to extraterrestrials in general. These inhabitants of Mars have variously been depicted as enlightened, evil, and decadent; in keeping with the conception of Mars as an older civilization than Earth, Westfahl refers to these as &quot;good parents&quot;, &quot;bad parents&quot;, and &quot;dependent parents&quot;, respectively.

Martians have also been equated with humans in different ways. Humans are revealed to be the descendants of Martians in several stories including the 1954 short story &quot;Survey Team&quot; by Philip K. Dick. Conversely, Martians are the descendants of humans from Earth in some works such as the 1889 novel &quot;Mr. Stranger&#x27;s Sealed Packet&quot; by Hugh MacColl, where a close approach between Mars and Earth in the past allowed some humans to get to Mars, and Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;Aelita&quot; where they are descended from inhabitants of the lost civilization of Atlantis. Human settlers take on the new identity of Martians in the 1946 short story &quot;The Million Year Picnic&quot; by Ray Bradbury (later included in the 1950 fix-up novel &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;), and this theme of &quot;becoming Martians&quot; came to be a recurring motif in Martian fiction toward the end of the century.

=== Enlightened ===

The portrayal of Martians as superior to Earthlings appeared throughout the utopian fiction of the late 1800s. In-depth treatment of the nuances of the concept was pioneered by Kurd Lasswitz with the 1897 novel &quot;Auf zwei Planeten&quot;, wherein the Martians visit Earth to share their more advanced knowledge with humans and gradually end up acting as an occupying colonial power. Martians sharing wisdom or knowledge with humans is a recurring element in these stories, and some works such as the 1952 novel &quot;David Starr, Space Ranger&quot; by Isaac Asimov depict Martians sharing their advanced technology with the inhabitants of Earth. Several depictions of enlightened Martians have a religious dimension: in the 1938 novel &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; by C. S. Lewis, Martians are depicted as Christian beings free from original sin, the Martian Klaatu who visits Earth in the 1951 film &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; is a Christ figure, and the 1961 novel &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; by Robert A. Heinlein revolves around a human raised by Martians who brings a religion based on their ideals to Earth as a prophet. In comic books, the superhero Martian Manhunter first appeared in 1955. In the 1956 novel &quot;No Man Friday&quot; by Rex Gordon, an astronaut stranded on Mars encounters pacifist Martians and feels compelled to omit the human history of warfare lest they think of humans as savage creatures akin to cannibals. On television, the 1963–1966 sitcom &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;—later adapted to children&#x27;s animation in 1973 and to film in 1999—portrayed a Martian comedically; the contemporaneous science fiction anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; also occasionally featured Martian characters,&quot;&quot; such as in &quot;Mr. Dingle, the Strong&quot; where they find disappointment in human lack of altruism and &quot;Controlled Experiment&quot; where murder is a foreign concept to them.

=== Evil ===
There is a long tradition of portraying Martians as warlike, perhaps inspired by the planet&#x27;s association with the Roman god of war. The seminal depiction of Martians as evil creatures was the 1897 novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; by H. G. Wells, wherein the Martians attack Earth. This characterization dominated the pulp era of science fiction, appearing in works such as the 1928 short story &quot;The Menace of Mars&quot; by Clare Winger Harris, the 1931 short story &quot;Monsters of Mars&quot; by Edmond Hamilton, and the 1935 short story &quot;Mars Colonizes&quot; by Miles J. Breuer. It quickly became regarded as a cliché and inspired a kind of countermovement that portrayed Martians as meek in works like the 1933 short story &quot;The Forgotten Man of Space&quot; by P. Schuyler Miller and the 1934 short story &quot;Old Faithful&quot; by Raymond Z. Gallun. The 1946 novel &quot;The Man from Mars&quot; by Polish science fiction writer Stanisław Lem likewise depicts a Martian mistreated by humans.

Outside of the pulps, the alien invasion theme pioneered by Wells appeared in Olaf Stapledon&#x27;s 1930 novel &quot;Last and First Men&quot;—with the twist that the invading Martians are cloud-borne and microscopic, and neither aliens nor humans recognize the other as a sentient species. In film, this theme gained popularity in 1953 with the releases of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot;; later films about Martian invasions of Earth include the 1954 film &quot;Devil Girl from Mars&quot;, the 1962 film &quot;The Day Mars Invaded Earth&quot;, a 1986 remake of &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot; and three different adaptations of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; in 2005. Martians attacking humans who come to Mars appear in the 1948 short story &quot;Mars Is Heaven!&quot; by Ray Bradbury (later revised and included in &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; as &quot;The Third Expedition&quot;), where they use telepathic abilities to impersonate the humans&#x27; deceased loved ones before killing them. Comical portrayals of evil Martians appear in the 1954 novel &quot;Martians, Go Home&quot; by Fredric Brown, where they are little green men who wreak havoc by exposing secrets and lies; in the form of the cartoon character Marvin the Martian introduced in the 1948 short film &quot;Haredevil Hare&quot;, who seeks to destroy Earth to get a better view of Venus; and in the 1996 film &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot;, a pastiche of 1950s alien invasion films.

=== Decadent ===

The conception of Martians as decadent was largely derived from Percival Lowell&#x27;s vision of Mars. The first appearance of Martians characterized by decadence in a work of fiction was in the 1905 novel &quot;Lieut. Gullivar Jones: His Vacation&quot; by Edwin Lester Arnold, one of the earliest examples of the planetary romance subgenre. The idea was developed further and popularized by Edgar Rice Burroughs in the 1912–1943 &quot;Barsoom&quot; series starting with &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot;. Burroughs presents a Mars in need of human intervention to regain its vitality, a place where violence has replaced sexual desire. Science fiction critic , in the 2011 non-fiction book &quot;Imagining Mars: A Literary History&quot;, identifies Burroughs&#x27;s work as the archetypal example of what he dubs &quot;masculinist fantasies&quot;, where &quot;male travelers &quot;expect&quot; to find princesses on Mars and devote much of their time either to courting or to protecting them&quot;. This version of Mars also functions as a kind of stand-in for the bygone American frontier, where protagonist John Carter—a Confederate veteran of the American Civil War who is made superhumanly strong by the lower gravity of Mars—encounters indigenous Martians representing Native Americans.

Burroughs&#x27;s vision of Mars would go on to have an influence approaching but not quite reaching Wells&#x27;s, inspiring the works of many other authors—for instance, C. L. Moore&#x27;s stories about Northwest Smith starting with the 1933 short story &quot;Shambleau&quot;. Another author who followed Burroughs&#x27;s lead in the decadent portrayal of Mars and its inhabitants—while updating the politics to reflect shifting attitudes toward colonialism and imperialism in the intervening years—was Leigh Brackett, the &quot;Queen of the Planetary Romance&quot;. Brackett&#x27;s works in this vein include the 1940 short story &quot;Martian Quest&quot; and the 1944 novel &quot;Shadow Over Mars&quot;, as well as the stories about Eric John Stark including the 1949 short story &quot;Queen of the Martian Catacombs&quot; and the 1951 short story &quot;Black Amazon of Mars&quot; (later expanded into the 1964 novels &quot;The Secret of Sinharat&quot; and &quot;People of the Talisman&quot;, respectively).

Decadent Martians appeared in many other stories as well. The 1933 novel &quot;Cat Country&quot; (&quot;貓城記&quot;) by Chinese science fiction writer Lao She portrays feline Martians overcome by vices such as opium addiction and corruption as a vehicle for satire of contemporary Chinese society. In the 1950 film &quot;Rocketship X-M&quot;, Martians are depicted as disfigured cavepeople inhabiting a barren wasteland, descendants of the few survivors of a nuclear holocaust; in the 1963 novel &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; by Walter Tevis a survivor of nuclear holocaust on Mars comes to Earth for refuge but finds it to be similarly corrupt and degenerate. Inverting the premise of Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, the 1963 short story &quot;A Rose for Ecclesiastes&quot; by Roger Zelazny sees decadent Martians visited by a preacher from Earth.

=== Past and non-humanoid life ===
In some stories where Mars is not inhabited by humanoid lifeforms, it was in the past or is inhabited by other types of life. The ruins of extinct Martian civilizations are depicted in the 1943 short story &quot;Lost Art&quot; by George O. Smith where their perpetual motion machine is recreated and the 1957 short story &quot;Omnilingual&quot; by H. Beam Piper in which scientists attempt to decipher their fifty-thousand-year-old language; the 1933 novel &quot;The Outlaws of Mars&quot; by Otis Adelbert Kline and the 1949 novel &quot;The Sword of Rhiannon&quot; by Leigh Brackett employ time travel to set stories in the past when Mars was still alive.

The 1934 short story &quot;A Martian Odyssey&quot; by Stanley G. Weinbaum contains what Webster describes as &quot;the first really alien aliens&quot; in science fiction, in contrast to previous depictions of Martians as monsters or essentially human. The story broke new ground in portraying an entire Martian ecosystem wholly unlike that of Earth—inhabited by species that are alien in anatomy and inscrutable in behaviour—and in depicting extraterrestrial life that is non-human and intelligent without being hostile. In particular, one Martian creature called Tweel is found to be intelligent but have thought processes that are utterly inhuman. This creates an impenetrable language barrier between the alien and the human it encounters, and they are limited to communicating through the universal language of mathematics. Asimov would later say that this story met the challenge science fiction editor John W. Campbell made to science fiction writers in the 1940s: to write a creature who thinks at least as well as humans, yet not &quot;like&quot; humans.

Three different species of intelligent lifeforms appear on Mars in C. S. Lewis&#x27;s 1938 novel &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;, only one of which is humanoid. In the 1943 short story &quot;The Cave&quot; by P. Schuyler Miller, lifeforms endure on Mars long after the civilization that used to exist there has driven itself to extinction through ecological collapse. The 1951 novel &quot;The Sands of Mars&quot; by Arthur C. Clarke features some indigenous life in the form of oxygen-producing plants and Martian creatures resembling Earth marsupials, but otherwise depicts a mostly desolate environment—reflecting then-emerging data about the scarcity of life-sustaining resources on Mars. Other novels of the 1950s likewise limited themselves to rudimentary lifeforms such as lichens and tumbleweed that could conceivably exist in the absence of any appreciable atmosphere or quantities of water.

=== Lifeless Mars ===

In light of the &quot;Mariner&quot; and &quot;Viking&quot; probes to Mars between 1965 and 1976 revealing the planet&#x27;s inhospitable conditions, almost all fiction started to portray Mars as a lifeless world. The disappointment of finding Mars to be hostile to life is reflected in the 1970 novel &quot;Die Erde ist nah&quot; (&quot;The Earth Is Near&quot;) by Czech science fiction writer Luděk Pešek, which depicts the members of an astrobiological expedition on Mars driven to despair by the realization that their search for life there is futile. A handful of authors still found ways to place life on the red planet: microbial life exists on Mars in the 1977 novel &quot;The Martian Inca&quot; by Ian Watson, and intelligent life is found in hibernation there in the 1977 short story &quot;In the Hall of the Martian Kings&quot; by John Varley. By the turn of the millennium, the idea of microbial life on Mars gained popularity, appearing in the 1999 novel &quot;The Martian Race&quot; by Gregory Benford and the 2001 novel &quot;The Secret of Life&quot; by Paul J. McAuley.

== Human survival ==
As stories about an inhabited Mars fell out of favour in the mid-1900s amid mounting evidence of the planet&#x27;s inhospitable nature, they were replaced by stories about enduring the harsh conditions of the planet. Themes in this tradition include colonization, terraforming, and pure survival stories.

=== Colonization ===
The colonization of Mars became a major theme in science fiction in the 1950s. The central piece of Martian fiction in this era was Ray Bradbury&#x27;s 1950 fix-up novel &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;, which contains a series of loosely connected stories depicting the first few decades of human efforts to colonize Mars. Unlike later works on this theme, &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; makes no attempt at realism (Mars has a breathable atmosphere, for instance, even though spectrographic analysis had at that time revealed no detectable amounts of oxygen); Bradbury said that &quot;Mars is a mirror, not a crystal&quot;, a vehicle for social commentary rather than attempting to predict the future. Contemporary issues touched upon in the book include McCarthyism in &quot;Usher II&quot;, racial segregation and lynching in the United States in &quot;Way in the Middle of the Air&quot;, and nuclear anxiety throughout. There are also several allusions to the European colonization of the Americas: the first few missions to Mars in the book encounter Martians, with direct references to both Hernán Cortés and the Trail of Tears, but the indigenous population soon goes extinct due to chickenpox in a parallel to the virgin soil epidemics that devastated Native American populations as a result of the Columbian exchange.

The majority of works about colonizing Mars endeavoured to portray the challenges of doing so realistically. The hostile environment of the planet is countered by the colonists bringing life-support systems in works like the 1951 novel &quot;The Sands of Mars&quot; by Arthur C. Clarke and the 1966 short story &quot;We Can Remember It for You Wholesale&quot; by Philip K. Dick, the early colonists during the centuries-long terraforming process in the 1953 short story &quot;Crucifixus Etiam&quot; by Walter M. Miller Jr. are dependent on a machine that oxygenates their blood from the thin atmosphere, and the scarcity of oxygen even after generations of terraforming forces the colonists to live in a domed city in the 1953 novel &quot;Police Your Planet&quot; by Lester del Rey. In the 1955 fix-up novel &quot;Alien Dust&quot; by Edwin Charles Tubb, colonists are unable to return to a life on Earth because inhaling the Martian dust has given them pneumoconiosis and the lower gravity has atrophied their muscles. The 1952 novel &quot;Outpost Mars&quot; by Cyril Judd (joint pseudonym of Cyril M. Kornbluth and Judith Merril) revolves around an attempt at making a Mars colony economically sustainable by way of resource extraction.

Mars colonies seeking independence from or outright revolting against Earth is a recurring motif; in del Rey&#x27;s &quot;Police Your Planet&quot; a revolution is precipitated by Earth using unrest against the colony&#x27;s corrupt mayor as a pretext for bringing Mars under firmer Terran control, and in Tubb&#x27;s &quot;Alien Dust&quot; the colonists threaten Earth with nuclear weapons unless their demands for necessary resources are met. In the 1952 short story &quot;The Martian Way&quot; by Isaac Asimov, Martian colonists extract water from the rings of Saturn so as not to depend on importing water from Earth. Besides direct conflicts with Earth, Mars colonies get other kinds of unfavourable treatment in several works. Mars is a dilapidated colony and neglected in favour of locations outside of the Solar System in the 1967 novel &quot;Born Under Mars&quot; by John Brunner, a place where political dissidents and criminals are exiled in &quot;Police Your Planet&quot;, and the site of an outright prison colony in the 1966 novel &quot;Farewell, Earth&#x27;s Bliss&quot; by David G. Compton. The vision of Mars as a prison colony recurs in Japanese science fiction author Moto Hagio&#x27;s 1978–1979 manga series &quot;Star Red&quot; (&quot;スター・レッド&quot;), a homage to Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;. The independence theme was adopted by on-screen portrayals of Mars colonies in the 1990s in works like the 1990 film &quot;Total Recall&quot; (a loose adaptation of Dick&#x27;s &quot;We Can Remember It for You Wholesale&quot;) and the 1994–1998 television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, now both in terms of Earth-based governments and—likely inspired by the emergence of Reaganomics—especially corporations.

=== Terraforming ===
Clarke&#x27;s &quot;The Sands of Mars&quot; features one of the earliest depictions of terraforming Mars to make it more hospitable to human life; in the novel, the atmosphere of Mars is made breathable by plants that release oxygen from minerals in the Martian soil, and the climate is improved by creating an artificial sun. The theme appeared occasionally in other 1950s works like the aforementioned &quot;Crucifixus Etiam&quot; and &quot;Police Your Planet&quot;, but largely fell out of favour in the 1960s as the scale of the associated challenges became apparent. By the 1970s, Martian literature as a whole had mostly succumbed to the discouragement of finding the planet&#x27;s conditions to be so hostile, and stories set on Mars became much less common than they had been in previous decades.

A resurgence of popularity of the terraforming theme began to emerge in the late 1970s in light of data from the &quot;Viking&quot; probes suggesting that there might be substantial quantities of non-liquid and sub-surface water on Mars; among the earliest such works are the 1977 novel &quot;The Martian Inca&quot; by Ian Watson and the 1978 novel &quot;A Double Shadow&quot; by Frederick Turner. Works depicting the terraforming of Mars continued to appear throughout the 1980s. The 1984 novel &quot;The Greening of Mars&quot; by James Lovelock and Michael Allaby, a study on how Mars might be settled and terraformed presented in the form of a fiction narrative, was influential on science and fiction alike. Kim Stanley Robinson was an early prolific writer on the subject with the 1982 short story &quot;Exploring Fossil Canyon&quot;, the 1984 novel &quot;Icehenge&quot;, and the 1985 short story &quot;Green Mars&quot;. Turner revisited the concept in 1988 with &quot;Genesis&quot;, a 10,000-line epic poem written in iambic pentameter, and Ian McDonald combined terraforming with magical realism in the 1988 novel &quot;Desolation Road&quot;.

By the 1990s, terraforming had become the predominant theme in Martian fiction. Several methods for accomplishing it were depicted, including ancient alien artefacts in the 1990 film &quot;Total Recall&quot; and the 1997 novel &quot;Mars Underground&quot; by William Kenneth Hartmann, utilizing indigenous animal lifeforms in the 1991 novel &quot;Martian Rainbow&quot; by Robert L. Forward, and relocating the entire planet to a new solar system in the 1993 novel &quot;Moving Mars&quot; by Greg Bear. The 1993 novel &quot;Red Dust&quot; by Paul J. McAuley portrays Mars in the process of reverting to its natural state after an abandoned attempt at terraforming it. With a Mars settled primarily by China, &quot;Red Dust&quot; also belongs to a tradition of portraying a multicultural Mars that developed parallel to the rise to prominence of the terraforming theme. Other such works include the 1989 novel &quot;Crescent in the Sky&quot; by Donald Moffitt, where Arabs apply their experience with surviving in desert conditions to living in their new caliphate on a partially terraformed Mars, and the 1991 novel &quot;The Martian Viking&quot; by Tim Sullivan where Mars is terraformed by Geats led by Hygelac.

The most prominent work of fiction dealing with the subject of terraforming Mars is the &quot;Mars&quot; trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson (consisting of the novels &quot;Red Mars&quot; from 1992, &quot;Green Mars&quot; from 1993, and &quot;Blue Mars&quot; from 1996), a hard science fiction story of a United Nations project wherein 100 carefully selected scientists are sent to Mars to start the first settlement there. The series explores in depth the practical and ideological considerations involved, the principal one being whether to turn Mars &quot;Green&quot; by terraforming or keep it in its pristine &quot;Red&quot; state. Other major topics besides the ethics of terraforming include the social and economic organization of the emerging Martian society and its political relationship to Earth and the multinational economic interests that finance the mission, revisiting the earlier themes of Mars as a setting for utopia—albeit in this case one in the making rather than a pre-existing one—and Martian struggle for independence from Earth. 

Alternatives to terraforming have also been explored. The opposite approach of modifying humans to adapt them to the existing environment, known as pantropy, appears in the 1976 novel &quot;Man Plus&quot; by Frederik Pohl but has otherwise been sparsely depicted. The conflict between pantropy and terraforming is explored in the 1994 novel &quot;Climbing Olympus&quot; by Kevin J. Anderson, as the humans that have been &quot;areoformed&quot; to survive on Mars do not wish the planet to be altered to accommodate unmodified humans at their expense. Other works where terraforming is eschewed in favour of alternatives include the 1996 novel &quot;River of Dust&quot; by Alexander Jablokov, where the settlers create a liveable environment by burrowing underground, and the 1999 novel &quot;White Mars, or, The Mind Set Free: A 21st-Century Utopia&quot; by Brian Aldiss and Roger Penrose where environmental preservation is prioritized and humans live in domed cities.

=== Robinsonades ===
Martian robinsonades—stories of astronauts stranded on Mars—emerged in the 1950s with works such as the 1952 novel &quot;Marooned on Mars&quot; by Lester del Rey, the 1956 novel &quot;No Man Friday&quot; by Rex Gordon, and the 1959 short story &quot;The Man Who Lost the Sea&quot; by Theodore Sturgeon. Crossley writes that &quot;No Man Friday&quot; is in some respects an &quot;anti-robinsonade&quot;, inasmuch as it rejects the underlying colonialist attitudes and portrays the Martians as more advanced than humans rather than less. Robinsonades remained popular throughout the 1960s; examples include the 1966 novel &quot;Welcome to Mars&quot; by James Blish and the 1964 film &quot;Robinson Crusoe on Mars&quot;, the latter being significantly if unofficially based on &quot;No Man Friday&quot;. The subgenre was later revisited with the 2011 novel &quot;The Martian&quot; by Andy Weir and its 2015 film adaptation, in which an astronaut accidentally left behind by the third mission to Mars uses the resources available to him to survive until such a time that he can be rescued.

== Nostalgic depictions ==
Although most stories by the middle of the 1900s acknowledged that advances in planetary science had rendered previous notions about the conditions of Mars obsolete and portrayed the planet accordingly, some continued to depict a romantic version of Mars rather than a realistic one. Besides the stories of Ray Bradbury&#x27;s 1950 fix-up novel &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;, another early example of this was Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s 1949 novel &quot;Red Planet&quot; where Mars has a breathable (albeit thin) atmosphere, a diverse ecosystem including sentient Martians, and Lowellian canals. Martian canals remained a prominent symbol of this more traditional vision of Mars, appearing both in lighthearted works like the 1954 novel &quot;Martians, Go Home&quot; by Fredric Brown and more serious ones like the 1963 novel &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; by Walter Tevis and the 1964 novel &quot;Martian Time-Slip&quot; by Philip K. Dick. Some works attempted to reconcile both visions of Mars, one example being the 1952 novel &quot;Marooned on Mars&quot; by Lester del Rey where the presumed canals turn out to be rows of vegetables and the only animal life is primitive.

As the Space Age commenced the divide between portraying Mars as it was and as it had previously been imagined deepened, and the discoveries made by Mariner 4 in 1965 solidified it. Some authors simply ignored the scientific findings, such as Lin Carter who included intelligent Martians in the 1973 novel &quot;The Man Who Loved Mars&quot;, and Leigh Brackett who declared in the foreword to &quot;The Coming of the Terrans&quot; (a 1967 collection of earlier short stories) that &quot;in the affairs of men and Martians, mere fact runs a poor second to Truth, which is mighty and shall prevail&quot;. Others were cognizant of them and used workarounds: Frank Herbert invented the fictional extrasolar Mars-like planet Arrakis for the 1965 novel &quot;Dune&quot; rather than setting the story on Mars, Robert F. Young set the 1979 short story &quot;The First Mars Mission&quot; in 1957 so as not to have to take the findings of Mariner 4 into account, and Colin Greenland set the 1993 novel &quot;Harm&#x27;s Way&quot; in the 1800s with corresponding scientific concepts like the luminiferous aether. The 1965 novel &quot;The Alternate Martians&quot; by A. Bertram Chandler is based on the premise that the depictions of Mars that appear in older stories are not incorrect but reflect alternative universes; the book is dedicated to &quot;the Mars that used to be, but never was&quot;. The urge to recapture the romantic vision of Mars is reflected as part of the story in the 1968 novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; by Philip K. Dick, where the people living on a desolate Mars enjoy reading old stories about the lifeful Mars that never was, as well as in the 1989 novel &quot;The Barsoom Project&quot; by Steven Barnes and Larry Niven, where the fantastical version of Mars is recreated as an amusement park.

Following the arrival of the &quot;Viking&quot; probes in 1976, the so-called &quot;Face on Mars&quot; superseded the Martian canals as the most central symbol of nostalgic depictions of Mars. The &quot;Face&quot; is a rock formation in the Cydonia region of Mars first photographed by the &quot;Viking 1&quot; orbiter under conditions that made it resemble a human face; higher-quality photographs taken by subsequent probes under different lighting conditions revealed this to be a case of pareidolia. It was popularized by Richard C. Hoagland, who interpreted it as an artificial construction by intelligent extraterrestrials, and has appeared in works of fiction including the 1992 novel &quot;Labyrinth of Night&quot; by Allen Steele, the 1995 short story &quot;The Great Martian Pyramid Hoax&quot; by Jerry Oltion, and the 1998 novel &quot;Semper Mars&quot; by Ian Douglas. Outside of literature, it has made appearances in the 1993 episode &quot;Space&quot; of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, the 2000 film &quot;Mission to Mars&quot;, and the 2002 episode &quot;Where the Buggalo Roam&quot; of the animated television show &quot;Futurama&quot;.

Deliberately nostalgic homages to older works have continued to appear through the turn of the millennium. In the 1999 novel &quot;Rainbow Mars&quot; by Larry Niven, a time traveller goes to visit Mars&#x27;s past but instead appears in the parallel universe of Mars&#x27;s fictional past and encounters the creations of science fiction authors such as H. G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Stories collected in Peter Crowther&#x27;s 2002 anthology &quot;Mars Probes&quot; pay tribute to the works of Stanley G. Weinbaum and Leigh Brackett, among others. The 2013 anthology &quot;Old Mars&quot; edited by George R. R. Martin and Gardner Dozois consists of newly written stories in the planetary romance style of older stories whose visions of Mars are now outdated; Martin compared it to the common practice of setting Westerns in a romanticized version of the Old West rather than a more realistic one.

== First landings and near-future human presence ==
Stories about the first human mission to Mars became popular after US president George H. W. Bush announced the Space Exploration Initiative in 1989, which proposed to accomplish this feat by 2019, though the concept had earlier appeared indirectly in the 1977 film &quot;Capricorn One&quot;, wherein NASA fakes the Mars landing. Among these are the 1992 novel &quot;Beachhead&quot; by Jack Williamson and the 1992 novel &quot;Mars&quot; in Ben Bova&#x27;s &quot;Grand Tour&quot; series, both of which emphasize the barrenness of the Martian landscape upon arrival and contrast it with a desire to find beauty there. The idea was spoofed in the 1990 novel &quot;Voyage to the Red Planet&quot; by Terry Bisson, which posits that a mission like that could only get funding by being turned into a movie. Stephen Baxter&#x27;s 1996 novel &quot;Voyage&quot; depicts an alternate history where US president John F. Kennedy was not assassinated in 1963, ultimately leading to the first Mars landing happening in 1986. The 1999 novel &quot;The Martian Race&quot; by Gregory Benford adapts the Mars Direct proposal by aerospace engineer Robert Zubrin to fiction by depicting a private sector competition to conduct the first crewed Mars landing with a large monetary reward attached. Zubrin would later write a story of his own along the same lines: the 2001 novel &quot;First Landing&quot;. In a variation on the theme, Ian McDonald&#x27;s 2002 short story &quot;The Old Cosmonaut and the Construction Worker Dream of Mars&quot; (included in the aforementioned anthology &quot;Mars Probes&quot;) portrays the lingering yearning for Mars in a future where the intended first Mars landing was cancelled and the era of space exploration has come to an end without the dream of a human mission to Mars ever being realized.

Beyond the events of the first crewed landing on Mars, this time period also saw an increase in portrayals of the early stages of exploration and settlement happening in the near future, especially following the 1996 launches of the &quot;Mars Pathfinder&quot; and &quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot; probes. In the 1991 novel &quot;Red Genesis&quot; by , settlement of Mars begins in 2015, though the bulk of the narrative is set decades later and focuses on the social—rather than technical—challenges of the project. The 1997 novel &quot;Mars Underground&quot; by William K. Hartmann also deals with the early efforts of establishing a permanent human presence on the red planet. The members of the third human mission to Mars are forced to trek across the planet&#x27;s surface in the 2000 novel &quot;Mars Crossing&quot; by Geoffrey A. Landis to reach a return vehicle from a previous mission after theirs is damaged beyond repair.

== In the new millennium ==

In the year 2000, Westfahl estimated the total number of works of fiction dealing with Mars up to that point to exceed five thousand. Depictions of Mars have remained common since then, though without a clear overarching trend—rather, says &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot;, Mars fiction has &quot;ramified in several directions&quot;. Monster movies set on Mars have appeared throughout this time period including the 2001 film &quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot;, the 2005 film &quot;Doom&quot; (based on the video game franchise), and the 2013 film &quot;The Last Days on Mars&quot;. In the 2003 novel &quot;Ilium&quot; by Dan Simmons and its 2005 sequel &quot;Olympos&quot;, the Trojan War is reenacted on Mars, and the 2011 animated film &quot;Mars Needs Moms&quot; revisits the older theme of evil Martians coming to Earth, though with more modest ambitions than launching an all-out invasion. The 2011–2021 novel series &quot;The Expanse&quot; by James S. A. Corey (joint pseudonym of Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck), starting with &quot;Leviathan Wakes&quot;, is a space opera set in part on Mars that was originally based on a role-playing game and later adapted to a television series starting in 2015. Tom Chmielewski&#x27;s 2014 novel &quot;Lunar Dust, Martian Sands&quot; is a piece of noir fiction set partially on Mars. &quot;The Martian&quot;—book and film—is hard science fiction; the film adaptation was described by the production team as being &quot;as much science fact as science fiction&quot;. The 100th anniversary of Burroughs&#x27;s &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; in 2012 saw the release of both the film adaptation &quot;John Carter&quot; and an anthology of new &quot;Barsoom&quot; fiction: &quot;Under the Moons of Mars: New Adventures on Barsoom&quot; edited by John Joseph Adams. In Polish science fiction, Rafał Kosik&#x27;s 2003 novel &quot;&quot; depicts people migrating to Mars to escape an Earth ravaged by overpopulation, and an anthology of short stories titled &quot;Mars: Antologia polskiej fantastyki&quot; (&quot;Mars: An Anthology of Polish Fantasy&quot;) was published in 2021. Mars has also made frequent appearances in video games; examples include the 2001 game &quot;Red Faction&quot; which is set on Mars and the 2014 game &quot;Destiny&quot; where Mars is an unlockable setting. In addition, Mars continues to make regular appearances in stories where it is not the main focus, such as Joe Haldeman&#x27;s 2008 novel &quot;Marsbound&quot;. Says Crossley, &quot;Where imagined Mars will go as the twenty-first century unfolds cannot be prophesied, because—undoubtedly—improbable, original, and masterful talents will work new variations on the matter of Mars.&quot;

== Moons ==

Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which were both discovered by Asaph Hall in 1877. The first appearance of the moons of Mars in fiction predates their discovery by a century and a half; the satirical 1726 novel &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; by Jonathan Swift includes a mention that the advanced astronomers of Laputa have discovered two Martian moons. The 1752 work &quot;Micromégas&quot; by Voltaire likewise mentions two moons of Mars; astronomy historian surmises that Voltaire was inspired by Swift. German astronomer , mistakenly believing that he had discovered a Martian moon, described a fictional voyage to it in the 1744 story &quot;Die Geschwinde Reise&quot; (&quot;The Speedy Journey&quot;).

The moons&#x27; small sizes have made them unpopular settings in science fiction, with some exceptions such as the 1955 novel &quot;Phobos, the Robot Planet&quot; by Paul Capon and the 2001 short story &quot;Romance with Phobic Variations&quot; by Tom Purdom in the case of Phobos, and the 1936 short story &quot;Crystals of Madness&quot; by D. L. James in the case of Deimos. Phobos is turned into a small star to provide heat and light to Mars in the 1951 novel &quot;The Sands of Mars&quot; by Arthur C. Clarke. The moons are revealed to be alien spacecraft in the 1955 juvenile novel &quot;The Secret of the Martian Moons&quot; by Donald A. Wollheim.

<text>The McIntosh ( ), McIntosh Red, or colloquially the Mac, is an apple cultivar, the national apple of Canada. The fruit has red and green skin, a tart flavour, and tender white flesh, which ripens in late September. It is considered an all-purpose apple, suitable both for cooking and eating raw.

In the 20th century, the McIntosh was the most popular cultivar in Eastern Canada and New England and was widely sold in the UK. However, after holding 40% of the Canadian market share in the 1960s through to 1996, its market share declined to 28% in 2014 and is expected to continue to do so, in part due to production cost and in part due to consumers favoring sweeter, crisper, and less tart apple varieties.

John McIntosh discovered the original McIntosh sapling on his Dundela farm in Upper Canada in 1811. He and his wife cultivated it, and the family started grafting the tree and selling the fruit in 1835. In 1870, it entered commercial production, and became common in northeastern North America after 1900. While still important in production, the fruit&#x27;s popularity fell in the early 21st century in the face of competition from varieties such as the Gala. According to the US Apple Association website, it is one of the fifteen most popular apple cultivars in the United States.

Jef Raskin, an employee at Apple Computer, named the Macintosh computer line—later abbreviated to &quot;Mac&quot; in 1999—after the cultivar.

==Description==

The McIntosh, or McIntosh Red (nicknamed the &quot;Mac&quot;), is the most popular apple cultivar in eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. It also sells well in Eastern Europe.

A spreading tree that is moderately vigorous, the McIntosh bears annually or in alternate years. The tree is hardy to at least USDA Hardiness zone 4a, or . 50% or more of its flowers die at or below.

The McIntosh apple is a small to medium-sized round fruit with a short stem. It has a red and green skin that is thick, tender, and easy to peel. Its white flesh is sometime tinged with green or pink and is juicy, tender, and firm, soon becoming soft. The flesh is easily bruised.

The fruit is considered &quot;all-purpose&quot;, suitable both for eating raw and for cooking. It is used primarily for dessert, and requires less time to cook than most cultivars. It is usually blended when used for juice.

The fruit grows best in cool areas where nights are cold and autumn days are clear; otherwise, it suffers from poor colour and soft flesh, and tends to fall from the tree before harvest. It stores for two to three months in air, but is prone to scald, flesh softening, chilling sensitivity, and coprinus rot. It can become when stored at temperatures below . The fruit is optimally stored in a controlled atmosphere in which temperatures are between , and air content is 1.5–4.5% oxygen and 1–5% carbon dioxide; under such conditions, the McIntosh will keep for five to eight months.

==Cultivation==

The McIntosh is most commonly cultivated in Canada, the United States, and Eastern Europe. It is one of the top five apple cultivars used in cloning, and research indicates the McIntosh combines well for winter hardiness.

If unsprayed, the McIntosh succumbs easily to apple scab, which may lead to entire crops being unmarketable. It has generally low susceptibility to fire blight, powdery mildew, cedar-apple rust, quince rust, and hawthorn rust. It is susceptible to fungal diseases such as &quot;Nectria&quot; canker, brown rot, black rot, race 1 of apple rust (but resists race 2). Furthermore, it is moderately resistant to &quot;Pezicula&quot; bark rot and &quot;Alternaria&quot; leaf blotch, and resists brown leaf spots well.

The McIntosh is one of the most common cultivars used in apple breeding; a 1996 study found that the McIntosh was a parent in 101 of 439 cultivars selected, more than any other founding clone. It was used in over half of the Canadian cultivars selected, and was used extensively in the United States and Eastern Europe as well; rarely was it used elsewhere. Offspring of the McIntosh include: the Jersey Black hybrid the Macoun, the Newtown Pippin hybrid the Spartan, the Cortland; the Empire; the Jonamac, the Jersey Mac, the Lobo, the Melba, the Summered, the Tydeman&#x27;s Red, and possibly the Paula Red.

==History==

Apple trees were introduced to Canada at the Habitation at Port-Royal as early as 1606 by French settlers. Following its introduction, apple cultivation spread inland.

The McIntosh&#x27;s discoverer, John McIntosh (1777 – ), left his native Mohawk Valley home in New York State in 1796 to follow his love, Dolly Irwin, who had been taken to Upper Canada by her Loyalist parents. She had died by the time he found her, but he settled as a farmer in Upper Canada. He married Hannah Doran in 1801, and they farmed along the Saint Lawrence River until 1811, when McIntosh exchanged the land he had with his brother-in-law Edward Doran for a plot in Dundela.

While clearing the overgrown plot, McIntosh discovered some apple seedlings on his farm. Since the crabapple was the only native apple in North America before European settlement, it must have had European origins. The Snow Apple (or Fameuse) had been popular in Lower Canada before that time; the seedlings may have sprouted from discarded fruit. Fall St Lawrence and Alexander have also been proposed, but the parentage remains unknown. He transplanted the seedlings next to his house. One of the seedlings bore particularly good fruit. The McIntosh grandchildren dubbed the fruit it produced &quot;Granny&#x27;s apple&quot;, as they often saw their grandmother taking care of the tree in the orchard. McIntosh was selling seedlings from the tree by 1820, but they did not produce fruit of the quality of the original.

John McIntosh&#x27;s son Allan (1815–1899) learned grafting about 1835; with this cloning, the McIntoshes could maintain the distinctive properties of the fruit of the original tree. Allan and brother Sandy (1825–1906), nicknamed &quot;Sandy the Grafter&quot;, increased production and promotion of the cultivar. Earliest sales were in 1835, and in 1836 the cultivar was renamed the &quot;McIntosh Red&quot;; it entered commercial production in 1870. The apple became popular after 1900, when the first sprays for apple scab were developed. A house fire damaged the original McIntosh tree in 1894; it last produced fruit in 1908, and died and fell over in 1910.

Horticulturist William Tyrrell Macoun of the Central Experimental Farm in Ottawa is credited with popularizing the McIntosh in Canada. He stated the McIntosh needed &quot;no words of praise&quot;, that it was &quot;one of the finest appearing and best dessert apples grown&quot;. The Macoun, a hybrid of the McIntosh and Jersey Black grown by the Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, NY, was named for him in 1923. In the northeastern United States, the McIntosh replaced many Baldwins that were killed in a severe winter in 1933–34. In the late 1940s, Canadian ambassador to the United Nations Andrew McNaughton told the Soviet Minister for Foreign Affairs Andrei Gromyko that the McIntosh Red was Canada&#x27;s best apple.

The McIntosh made up 40% of the Canadian apple market by the 1960s; and at least thirty varieties of McIntosh hybrid were known by 1970.

Its popularity later waned in the face of competition from imports; in the first decade of the 21st century, the Gala accounted for 33% of the apple market in Ontario to the McIntosh&#x27;s 12%, and the Northern Spy had become the preferred apple for pies. Production remained important to Ontario, however, as of McIntoshes were produced in 2010.

The original tree discovered by John McIntosh bore fruit for more than ninety years, and died in 1910. Horticulturalists from the Upper Canada Village heritage park saved cuttings from the last known first-generation McIntosh graft before it died in 2011 for producing clones.

==Cultural significance==

The McIntosh has been designated the national apple of Canada. A popular subscription funded a plaque placed from the original McIntosh tree in 1912. The Ontario Archaeological and Historic Sites Board replaced the plaque with a more descriptive one in 1962, and the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada put up another in a park nearby in 2001, by a painted mural commemorating the fruit.

Apple Inc. employee Jef Raskin named the Macintosh line of personal computers after the McIntosh. He deliberately misspelled the name to avoid conflict with the hi-fi equipment manufacturer McIntosh Laboratory. Apple&#x27;s attempt in 1982 to trademark the name Macintosh was nevertheless denied due to the phonetic similarity between Apple&#x27;s product and the name of the hi-fi manufacturer. Apple licensed the rights to the name in 1983, and bought the trademark in 1986.

In 1995, the Royal Canadian Mint commissioned Toronto artist Roger Hill to design a commemorative silver dollar for release in 1996. Mint engraver Sheldon Beveridge engraved the image of a group of three McIntoshes and a McIntosh blossom, which adorn one side with a ribbon naming the variety. An inscription on the edge reads &quot;1796 Canada Dollar 1996&quot;. Issued sheathed in a silver cardboard sleeve in a black leatherette case, 133,779 pieces of the proof were sold, as well as 58,834 pieces of the uncirculated version in a plastic capsule and silver sleeve.

<text>A machete (; ) is a broad blade used either as an agricultural implement similar to an axe, or in combat like a long-bladed knife. The blade is typically long and usually under thick. In the Spanish language, the word is possibly a diminutive form of the word &quot;macho&quot;, which was used to refer to sledgehammers. Alternatively, its origin may be &quot;machaera&quot;, the name given by the Greeks and Romans to the falcata. It is the origin of the English language equivalent term &quot;matchet&quot;, though this is rarely used. In much of the English-speaking Caribbean, such as Jamaica, Barbados, Guyana, Grenada, and Trinidad and Tobago, the term &quot;cutlass&quot; is used for these agricultural tools.

== Uses ==

=== Agriculture===
In various tropical and subtropical countries, the machete is frequently used to cut through rainforest undergrowth and for agricultural purposes (e.g. cutting sugar cane). Besides this, in Latin America a common use is for such household tasks as cutting large foodstuffs into pieces—much as a cleaver is used—or to perform crude cutting tasks, such as making simple wooden handles for other tools. It is common to see people using machetes for other jobs, such as splitting open coconuts, yard work, removing small branches and plants, chopping animals&#x27; food, and clearing bushes.

Machetes are often considered tools and used by adults. However, many hunter–gatherer societies and cultures surviving through subsistence agriculture begin teaching babies to use sharp tools, including machetes, before their first birthdays.

=== Warfare ===
People in uprisings sometimes use these weapons. For example, the Boricua Popular Army are unofficially called &quot;macheteros&quot; because of the machete-wielding laborers of sugar cane fields of past Puerto Rico.

Many of the killings in the 1994 Rwandan genocide were performed with machetes, and they were the primary weapon used by the Interahamwe militias there. Machetes were also a distinctive tool and weapon of the Haitian &quot;Tonton Macoute&quot;.

In 1762, the British captured Havana in a lengthy siege during the Seven Years&#x27; War. Volunteer militiamen led by Pepe Antonio, a Guanabacoa councilman, were issued with machetes during the unsuccessful defense of the city. The machete was also the most iconic weapon during the independence wars in Cuba, although it saw limited battlefield use. Carlos Manuel de Céspedes, owner of the sugar refinery &quot;La Demajagua&quot; near Manzanillo, freed his slaves on 10 October 1868. He proceeded to lead them, armed with machetes, in revolt against the Spanish government. The first cavalry charge using machetes as the primary weapon was carried out on 4 November 1868 by Máximo Gómez, a sergeant born in the Dominican Republic, who later became the general in chief of the Cuban Army.

The machete is a common side arm and tool for many ethnic groups in West Africa. Machetes in this role are referenced in Chinua Achebe&#x27;s &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;.

Some countries have a name for the blow of a machete; the Spanish &quot;machetazo&quot; is sometimes used in English. In the British Virgin Islands, Grenada, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Barbados, Saint Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago, the word &quot;planass&quot; means to hit someone with the flat of the blade of a machete or cutlass. To strike with the sharpened edge is to &quot;chop&quot;. Throughout the English-speaking islands of the Caribbean, the term &#x27;cutlass&#x27; refers to a laborers&#x27; cutting tool.

The Brazilian Army&#x27;s Instruction Center on Jungle Warfare developed a machete-style knife with a blade in length and a very pronounced clip point. This machete is issued with a Bowie knife and a sharpening stone in the scabbard; collectively called a &quot;jungle kit&quot; (&quot;Conjunto de Selva&quot; in Portuguese); it is manufactured by Indústria de Material Bélico do Brasil (IMBEL).

The machete was used as a weapon during the Mau Mau rebellion, in the Rwandan Genocide, and in South Africa, particularly in the 1980s and early 1990s when the former province of Natal was wracked by conflict between the African National Congress and the Zulu-nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party.

== Manufacture ==

Good machetes rely on the materials used and the shape. In the past, the most famous manufacturer of machetes in Latin America and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean was Collins Company of Collinsville, Connecticut. The company was founded as Collins &amp; Company in 1826 by Samuel W. Collins to make axes. Its first machetes were sold in 1845 and became so famous that a machete was called . In the English-speaking Caribbean, Robert Mole &amp; Sons of Birmingham, England, was long considered the manufacturer of agricultural cutlasses of the best quality. Some Robert Mole blades survive as souvenirs of travellers to Trinidad, Jamaica, and, less commonly, St. Lucia.

Colombia is the largest exporter of machetes worldwide.

== Cultural influence ==
The flag of Angola features a machete, along with a cog-wheel.

The southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul has a dance called the &quot;dança dos facões&quot; (machetes&#x27; dance) in which the dancers, who are usually men, bang their machetes against various surfaces while dancing, simulating a battle. &quot;Maculelê&quot;, an Afro-Brazilian dance and martial art, can also be performed with &quot;facões&quot;. This practice began in the city of Santo Amaro, Bahia, in the northeastern part of the country.

In the Philippines, the &quot;bolo&quot; is used in training in &quot;eskrima&quot;, the indigenous martial art of the Philippines.

In the Jalisco region of Mexico, Los Machetes is a popular folk dance. This dance tells the story of cutting down sugar cane during the harvest. Los Machetes was created by Mexican farm workers who spent a great amount of time perfecting the use of the tool, the machete, for harvesting. Traditionally, real machetes are used while performing this dance.

== Similar tools ==
The panga or &quot;tapanga&quot; is a variant used in East and Southern Africa. This name may be of Swahili etymology; not to be confused with the panga fish. The &quot;panga&quot; blade broadens on the backside and has a length of . The upper inclined portion of the blade may be sharpened.

Other similar tools include the &quot;parang&quot; and the &quot;golok&quot; (from Malaysia and Indonesia); however, these tend to have shorter, thicker blades with a primary grind, and are more effective on woody vegetation.

The is a similar tool used in Armenia for clearing land of vegetation.

Other similar tools include:

* Dusack
* Golok
* Kopis
