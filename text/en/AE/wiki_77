<text>Origen of Alexandria ( 185 – 253), also known as Origen Adamantius, was an early Christian scholar, ascetic, and theologian who was born and spent the first half of his career in Alexandria. He was a prolific writer who wrote roughly 2,000 treatises in multiple branches of theology, including textual criticism, biblical exegesis and hermeneutics, homiletics, and spirituality. He was one of the most influential and controversial figures in early Christian theology, apologetics, and asceticism. He has been described by John Anthony McGuckin as &quot;the greatest genius the early church ever produced&quot;.

==Overview==
Origen sought martyrdom with his father at a young age but was prevented from turning himself in to the authorities by his mother. When he was eighteen years old, Origen became a catechist at the or School of Alexandria. He devoted himself to his studies and adopted an ascetic lifestyle. He came into conflict with Demetrius, bishop of Alexandria, in 231 after he was ordained as a presbyter by his friend Theoclistus, the bishop of Caesarea, while on a journey to Athens through Palestine. Demetrius condemned Origen for insubordination and accused him of having castrated himself and of having taught that even Satan would eventually attain salvation, an accusation which Origen vehemently denied. Origen founded the Christian School of Caesarea, where he taught logic, cosmology, natural history, and theology, and became regarded by the churches of Palestine and Arabia as the ultimate authority on all matters of theology. He was tortured for his faith during the Decian persecution in 250 and died three to four years later from his injuries.

Origen produced a massive quantity of writings because of the patronage of his close friend Ambrose of Alexandria, who provided him with a team of secretaries to copy his works, making him one of the most prolific writers in late antiquity. His treatise &quot;On the First Principles&quot; systematically laid out the principles of Christian theology and became the foundation for later theological writings. He also authored , the most influential work of early Christian apologetics, in which he defended Christianity against the pagan philosopher Celsus, one of its foremost early critics. Origen produced the , the first critical edition of the Hebrew Bible, which contained the original Hebrew text, four different Greek translations, and a Greek transliteration of the Hebrew, all written in columns, side by side. He wrote hundreds of sermons covering almost the entire Bible, interpreting many passages as allegorical. Origen taught that, before the creation of the material universe, God had created the souls of all intelligent beings. These souls, at first fully devoted to God, fell away from him and were given physical bodies. Origen was the first to propose the ransom theory of atonement in its fully developed form, and he also significantly contributed to the development of the concept of the Trinity. Origen hoped that all people might eventually attain salvation but was always careful to maintain that this was only speculation. He defended free will and advocated Christian pacifism.

Origen is considered by some Christian groups to be a Church Father. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential Christian theologians. His teachings were especially influential in the east, with Athanasius of Alexandria and the three Cappadocian Fathers being among his most devoted followers. Argument over the orthodoxy of Origen&#x27;s teachings spawned the First Origenist Crisis in the late fourth century, in which he was attacked by Epiphanius of Salamis and Jerome but defended by Tyrannius Rufinus and John of Jerusalem. In 543, Emperor Justinian I condemned him as a heretic and ordered all his writings to be burned. The Second Council of Constantinople in 553 may have anathematized Origen, or it may have only condemned certain heretical teachings which claimed to be derived from Origen. The Church rejected his teachings on the pre-existence of souls.

==Life==

===Early years===
Almost all information about Origen&#x27;s life comes from a lengthy biography of him in Book VI of the &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; written by the Christian historian Eusebius ( – c. 340). Eusebius portrays Origen as the perfect Christian scholar and a literal saint. Eusebius, however, wrote this account almost fifty years after Origen&#x27;s death and had access to few reliable sources on Origen&#x27;s life, especially his early years. Anxious for more material about his hero, Eusebius recorded events based only on unreliable hearsay evidence. He frequently made speculative inferences about Origen based on the sources he had available. Nonetheless, scholars can reconstruct a general impression of Origen&#x27;s historical life by sorting out the parts of Eusebius&#x27;s account that are accurate from those that are inaccurate.

Origen was born in either 185 or 186 AD in Alexandria. Porphyry called him &quot;a Greek, and educated in Greek literature&quot;. According to Eusebius, Origen&#x27;s father was Leonides of Alexandria, a respected professor of literature and also a devout Christian who practised his religion openly (and later a martyr and saint with a feast day of April 22 in the Catholic church). Joseph Wilson Trigg deems the details of this report unreliable, but admits that Origen&#x27;s father was certainly at least &quot;a prosperous and thoroughly Hellenized bourgeois&quot;. According to John Anthony McGuckin, Origen&#x27;s mother, whose name is unknown, may have been a member of the lower class who did not have the right of citizenship. It is likely that, on account of his mother&#x27;s status, Origen was not a Roman citizen. Origen&#x27;s father taught him about literature and philosophy as well as the Bible and Christian doctrine. Eusebius states that Origen&#x27;s father made him memorize passages of scripture daily. Trigg accepts this tradition as possibly genuine, given Origen&#x27;s ability as an adult to recite extended passages of scripture at will. Eusebius also reports that Origen became so learned about the holy scriptures at an early age that his father was unable to answer his questions about them.

In 202, when Origen was &quot;not yet seventeen&quot;, the Roman emperor Septimius Severus ordered Roman citizens who openly practised Christianity to be executed. Origen&#x27;s father Leonides was arrested and thrown in prison. Eusebius reports that Origen wanted to turn himself in to the authorities so that they would execute him as well, but his mother hid all his clothes and he was unable to go to the authorities since he refused to leave the house naked. According to McGuckin, even if Origen had turned himself in, it is unlikely that he would have been punished, since the emperor was only intent on executing Roman citizens. Origen&#x27;s father was beheaded, and the state confiscated the family&#x27;s entire property, leaving them impoverished. Origen was the eldest of nine children, and as his father&#x27;s heir, it became his responsibility to provide for the whole family.

When he was eighteen, Origen was appointed as a catechist at the Catechetical School of Alexandria. Many scholars have assumed that Origen became the head of the school, but according to McGuckin, this is highly improbable. It is more likely that he was given a paid teaching position, perhaps as a &quot;relief effort&quot; for his impoverished family. While employed at the school, he adopted the ascetic lifestyle of the Greek Sophists. He spent the whole day teaching and would stay up late at night writing treatises and commentaries. He went barefoot and only owned one cloak. He did not drink alcohol and ate a simple diet and he often fasted for long periods. Although Eusebius goes to great lengths to portray Origen as one of the Christian monastics of his era, this portrayal is now generally recognized as anachronistic.

According to Eusebius, as a young man, Origen was taken in by a wealthy Gnostic woman, who was also the patron of a very influential Gnostic theologian from Antioch, who frequently lectured in her home. Eusebius goes to great lengths to insist that, although Origen studied while in her home, he never once &quot;prayed in common&quot; with her or the Gnostic theologian. Later, Origen succeeded in converting a wealthy man named Ambrose from Valentinian Gnosticism to orthodox Christianity. Ambrose was so impressed by the young scholar that he gave Origen a house, a secretary, seven stenographers, a crew of copyists and calligraphers, and paid for all of his writings to be published.

When he was in his early twenties, Origen sold the small library of Greek literary works that he had inherited from his father for a sum which netted him a daily income of four obols. He used this money to continue his study of the Bible and of philosophy. Origen studied at numerous schools throughout Alexandria, including the Platonic Academy of Alexandria, where he was a student of Ammonius Saccas. Eusebius claims that Origen studied under Clement of Alexandria, but according to McGuckin, this is almost certainly a retrospective assumption based on the similarity of their teachings. Origen rarely mentions Clement in his writings, and when he does, it is usually to correct him.

===Alleged self-castration===
Eusebius claims that, as a young man, following a literal reading of Matthew 19:12, in which Jesus is presented as saying &quot;there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuch for the sake of the kingdom of heaven&quot;, Origen either castrated himself or had someone else castrate him in order to ensure his reputation as a respectable tutor to young men and women. Eusebius further alleges that Origen privately told Demetrius, the bishop of Alexandria, about the castration and that Demetrius initially praised him for his devotion to God on account of it. Origen, however, never mentions anything about having castrated himself in any of his surviving writings, and in his explanation of this verse in his &quot;Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew&quot;, written near the end of life, he strongly condemns any literal interpretation of Matthew 19:12, asserting that only an idiot would interpret the passage as advocating literal castration.

Since the beginning of the twentieth century, some scholars have questioned the historicity of Origen&#x27;s self-castration, with many seeing it as a wholesale fabrication. Trigg states that Eusebius&#x27;s account of Origen&#x27;s self-castration is certainly true, because Eusebius, who was an ardent admirer of Origen, yet clearly describes the castration as an act of pure folly, would have had no motive to pass on a piece of information that might tarnish Origen&#x27;s reputation unless it was &quot;notorious and beyond question&quot;. Trigg sees Origen&#x27;s condemnation of the literal interpretation of Matthew 19:12 as him &quot;tacitly repudiating the literalistic reading he had acted on in his youth&quot;.

In sharp contrast, McGuckin dismisses Eusebius&#x27;s story of Origen&#x27;s self-castration as &quot;hardly credible&quot;, seeing it as a deliberate attempt by Eusebius to distract from more serious questions regarding the orthodoxy of Origen&#x27;s teachings. McGuckin also states: &quot;We have no indication that the motive of castration for respectability was ever regarded as standard by a teacher of mixed-gender classes.&quot; He adds that Origen&#x27;s female students (whom Eusebius lists by name) would have been accompanied by attendants at all times, meaning that Origen would have had no good reason to think that anyone would suspect him of impropriety. Henry Chadwick argues that, while Eusebius&#x27;s story may be true, it seems unlikely, given that Origen&#x27;s exposition of Matthew 19:12 &quot;strongly deplored any literal interpretation of the words&quot;. Instead, Chadwick suggests, &quot;Perhaps Eusebius was uncritically reporting malicious gossip retailed by Origen&#x27;s enemies, of whom there were many.&quot; However, many noted historians, such as Peter Brown and William Placher, continue to find no reason to conclude that the story is false. Placher theorizes that, if it is true, it may have followed an episode in which Origen received some raised eyebrows while privately tutoring a woman.

===Travels and early writings===
In his early twenties Origen became less interested in work as a grammarian and more interested in operating as a rhetor-philosopher. He gave his job as a catechist to his younger colleague Heraclas. Meanwhile, Origen began to style himself as a &quot;master of philosophy&quot;. Origen&#x27;s new position as a self-styled Christian philosopher brought him into conflict with Demetrius, the bishop of Alexandria. Demetrius, a charismatic leader who ruled the Christian congregation of Alexandria with an iron fist, became the most direct promoter of the elevation in status of the bishop of Alexandria; before Demetrius, the bishop of Alexandria had merely been a priest who was elected to represent his fellows, but after Demetrius, the bishop was seen as clearly a rank higher than his fellow priests. By styling himself as an independent philosopher, Origen was reviving a role that had been prominent in earlier Christianity but which challenged the authority of the now-powerful bishop.

Meanwhile, Origen began composing his massive theological treatise &quot;On the First Principles&quot;, a landmark book which systematically laid out the foundations of Christian theology for centuries to come. Origen also began travelling abroad to visit schools across the Mediterranean. In 212 he travelled to Rome – a major center of philosophy at the time. In Rome, Origen attended lectures by Hippolytus of Rome and was influenced by his theology. In 213 or 214, the governor of the Province of Arabia sent a message to the prefect of Egypt requesting him to send Origen to meet with him so that he could interview him and learn more about Christianity from its leading intellectual. Origen, escorted by official bodyguards, spent a short time in Arabia with the governor before returning to Alexandria.

In the autumn of 215, the Roman Emperor Caracalla visited Alexandria. During the visit, the students at the schools there protested and made fun of him for having murdered his brother Geta (died 211). Caracalla, incensed, ordered his troops to ravage the city, execute the governor, and kill all the protesters. He also commanded them to expel all the teachers and intellectuals from the city. Origen fled Alexandria and traveled to the city of Caesarea Maritima in the Roman province of Palestine, where the bishops Theoctistus of Caesarea and Alexander of Jerusalem became his devoted admirers and asked him to deliver discourses on the scriptures in their respective churches. This effectively allowed Origen to deliver sermons even though he was not formally ordained. While this was an unexpected phenomenon, especially given Origen&#x27;s international fame as a teacher and philosopher, it infuriated Demetrius, who saw it as a direct undermining of his authority. Demetrius sent deacons from Alexandria to demand that the Palestinian hierarchs immediately return &quot;his&quot; catechist to Alexandria. He also issued a decree chastising the Palestinians for allowing a person who was not ordained to preach. The Palestinian bishops, in turn, issued their condemnation, accusing Demetrius of being jealous of Origen&#x27;s fame and prestige.

Origen obeyed Demetrius&#x27;s order and returned to Alexandria, bringing with him an antique scroll he had purchased at Jericho containing the full text of the Hebrew Bible. The manuscript, which had purportedly been found &quot;in a jar&quot;, became the source text for one of the two Hebrew columns in Origen&#x27;s . Origen studied the Old Testament in great depth; Eusebius even claims that Origen learned Hebrew. Most modern scholars regard this claim as implausible, but they disagree over how much Origen knew about the language. H. Lietzmann concludes that Origen probably only knew the Hebrew alphabet and not much else, whereas R. P. C. Hanson and G. Bardy argue that Origen had a superficial understanding of the language but not enough to have composed the entire . A note in Origen&#x27;s &quot;On the First Principles&quot; mentions an unknown &quot;Hebrew master&quot;, but this was probably a consultant, not a teacher.

Origen also studied the entire New Testament, but especially the epistles of the apostle Paul and the Gospel of John, the writings which Origen regarded as the most important and authoritative. At Ambrose&#x27;s request, Origen composed the first five books of his exhaustive &quot;Commentary on the Gospel of John&quot;, He also wrote the first eight books of his &quot;Commentary on Genesis&quot;, his &quot;Commentary on Psalms 1–25&quot;, and his &quot;Commentary on Lamentations&quot;. In addition to these commentaries, Origen also wrote two books on the resurrection of Jesus and ten books of (&#x27;Miscellanies&#x27;). It is likely that these works contained much theological speculation, which brought Origen into even greater conflict with Demetrius.

===Conflict with Demetrius and removal to Caesarea===

Origen repeatedly asked Demetrius to ordain him as a priest, but Demetrius continually refused. In around 231, Demetrius sent Origen on a mission to Athens. Along the way, Origen stopped in Caesarea, where he was warmly greeted by the bishops Theoctistus of Caesarea and Alexander of Jerusalem, who had become his close friends during his previous stay. While he was visiting Caesarea, Origen asked Theoctistus to ordain him as a priest. Theoctistus gladly complied. Upon learning of Origen&#x27;s ordination, Demetrius was outraged and issued a condemnation declaring that Origen&#x27;s ordination by a foreign bishop was an act of insubordination.

Eusebius reports that as a result of Demetrius&#x27;s condemnations, Origen decided not to return to Alexandria and instead to take up permanent residence in Caesarea. John Anthony McGuckin, however, argues that Origen had probably already been planning to stay in Caesarea. The Palestinian bishops declared Origen the chief theologian of Caesarea. Firmilian, the bishop of Caesarea Mazaca in Cappadocia, was such a devoted disciple of Origen that he begged him to come to Cappadocia and teach there.

Demetrius raised a storm of protests against the bishops of Palestine and the church synod in Rome. According to Eusebius, Demetrius published the allegation that Origen had secretly castrated himself, a capital offense under Roman law at the time and one which would have made Origen&#x27;s ordination invalid, since eunuchs were forbidden from becoming priests. Demetrius also alleged that Origen had taught an extreme form of , which held that all beings, including even Satan himself, would eventually attain salvation. This allegation probably arose from a misunderstanding of Origen&#x27;s argument during a debate with the Valentinian Gnostic teacher Candidus. Candidus had argued in favor of predestination by declaring that the Devil was beyond salvation. Origen had responded by arguing that, if the Devil is destined for eternal damnation, it was on account of his actions, which were the result of his own free will. Therefore, Origen had declared that Satan was only morally reprobate, not absolutely reprobate.

Demetrius died in 232, less than a year after Origen&#x27;s departure from Alexandria. The accusations against Origen faded with the death of Demetrius, but they did not disappear entirely and they continued to haunt him for the rest of his career. Origen defended himself in his &quot;Letter to Friends in Alexandria&quot;, in which he vehemently denied that he had ever taught that the Devil would attain salvation and insisted that the very notion of the Devil attaining salvation was simply ludicrous.

===Work and teaching in Caesarea===
During his early years in Caesarea, Origen&#x27;s primary task was the establishment of a Christian School; Caesarea had long been seen as a center of learning for Jews and Hellenistic philosophers, but until Origen&#x27;s arrival, it had lacked a Christian center of higher education. According to Eusebius, the school Origen founded was primarily targeted towards young pagans who had expressed interest in Christianity but were not yet ready to ask for baptism. The school therefore sought to explain Christian teachings through Middle Platonism. Origen started his curriculum by teaching his students classical Socratic reasoning. After they had mastered this, he taught them cosmology and natural history. Finally, once they had mastered all of these subjects, he taught them theology, which was the highest of all philosophies, the accumulation of everything they had previously learned.

With the establishment of the Caesarean school, Origen&#x27;s reputation as a scholar and theologian reached its zenith and he became known throughout the Mediterranean world as a brilliant intellectual. The hierarchs of the Palestinian and Arabian church synods regarded Origen as the ultimate expert on all matters dealing with theology. While teaching in Caesarea, Origen resumed work on his &quot;Commentary on John&quot;, composing at least books six through ten. In the first of these books, Origen compares himself to &quot;an Israelite who has escaped the perverse persecution of the Egyptians&quot;. Origen also wrote the treatise &quot;On Prayer&quot; at the request of his friend Ambrose and Tatiana (referred to as the &quot;sister&quot; of Ambrose), in which he analyzes the different types of prayers described in the Bible and offers a detailed exegesis on the Lord&#x27;s Prayer.

Pagans also took a fascination with Origen. The Neoplatonist philosopher Porphyry heard of Origen&#x27;s fame and traveled to Caesarea to listen to his lectures. Porphyry recounts that Origen had extensively studied the teachings of Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle, but also those of important Middle Platonists, Neopythagoreans, and Stoics, including Numenius of Apamea, Chronius, Apollophanes, Longinus, Moderatus of Gades, Nicomachus, Chaeremon, and Cornutus. Nonetheless, Porphyry accused Origen of having betrayed true philosophy by subjugating its insights to the exegesis of the Christian scriptures. Eusebius reports that Origen was summoned from Caesarea to Antioch at the behest of Julia Avita Mamaea, the mother of Roman Emperor Severus Alexander, &quot;to discuss Christian philosophy and doctrine with her&quot;.

In 235, approximately three years after Origen began teaching in Caesarea, Alexander Severus, who had been tolerant towards Christians, was murdered and Emperor Maximinus Thrax instigated a purge of all those who had supported his predecessor. His pogroms targeted Christian leaders and, in Rome, Pope Pontianus and Hippolytus of Rome were both sent into exile. Origen knew that he was in danger and went into hiding in the home of a faithful Christian woman named Juliana the Virgin, who had been a student of the Ebionite leader Symmachus. Origen&#x27;s close friend and longtime patron Ambrose was arrested in Nicomedia, and Protoctetes, the leading priest in Caesarea, was also arrested. In their honor, Origen composed his treatise &quot;Exhortation to Martyrdom&quot;, which is now regarded as one of the greatest classics of Christian resistance literature. After coming out of hiding following Maximinus&#x27;s death, Origen founded a school of which Gregory Thaumaturgus, later bishop of Pontus, was one of the pupils. He preached regularly on Wednesdays and Fridays, and later daily.

===Later life===

Sometime between 238 and 244, Origen visited Athens, where he completed his &quot;Commentary on the Book of Ezekiel&quot; and began writing his &quot;Commentary on the Song of Songs&quot;. After visiting Athens, he visited Ambrose in Nicomedia. According to Porphyry, Origen also travelled to Rome or Antioch, where he met Plotinus, the founder of Neoplatonism. The Christians of the eastern Mediterranean continued to revere Origen as the most orthodox of all theologians, and when the Palestinian hierarchs learned that Beryllus, the bishop of Bostra and one of the most energetic Christian leaders of the time, had been preaching adoptionism (the belief that Jesus was born human and only became divine after his baptism), they sent Origen to convert him to orthodoxy. Origen engaged Beryllus in a public disputation, which went so successfully that Beryllus promised only to teach Origen&#x27;s theology from then on. On another occasion, a Christian leader in Arabia named Heracleides began teaching that the soul was mortal and that it perished with the body. Origen refuted these teachings, arguing that the soul is immortal and can never die.

In 249, the Plague of Cyprian broke out. In 250, Emperor Decius, believing that the plague was caused by Christians&#x27; failure to recognise him as divine, issued a decree for Christians to be persecuted. This time Origen did not escape. Eusebius recounts how Origen suffered &quot;bodily tortures and torments under the iron collar and in the dungeon; and how for many days with his feet stretched four spaces in the stocks&quot;. The governor of Caesarea gave very specific orders that Origen was not to be killed until he had publicly renounced his faith in Christ. Origen endured two years of imprisonment and torture, but obstinately refused to renounce his faith. In June 251, Decius was killed fighting the Goths in the Battle of Abritus, and Origen was released from prison. Nonetheless, Origen&#x27;s health was broken by the physical tortures enacted on him, and he died less than a year later at the age of sixty-nine. A later legend, recounted by Jerome and numerous itineraries, places his death and burial at Tyre, but little value can be attached to this.

==Works==
===Exegetical writings===
Origen was an extremely prolific writer. According to Epiphanius, he wrote a grand total of roughly 6,000 works over the course of his lifetime. Most scholars agree that this estimate is probably somewhat exaggerated. According to Jerome, Eusebius listed the titles of just under 2,000 treatises written by Origen in his lost &quot;Life of Pamphilus&quot;. Jerome compiled an abbreviated list of Origen&#x27;s major treatises, itemizing 800 different titles.

By far the most important work of Origen on textual criticism was the (&#x27;Sixfold&#x27;), a massive comparative study of various translations of the Old Testament in six columns: Hebrew, Hebrew in Greek characters, the Septuagint, and the Greek translations of Theodotion (a Jewish scholar from 180 AD), Aquila of Sinope (another Jewish scholar from 117–138), and Symmachus (an Ebionite scholar from 193–211). Origen was the first Christian scholar to introduce critical markers to a Biblical text. He marked the Septuagint column of the &quot;Hexapla&quot; using signs adapted from those used by the textual critics of the Great Library of Alexandria: a passage found in the Septuagint that was not found in the Hebrew text would be marked with an asterisk (*) and a passage that was found in other Greek translations, but not in the Septuagint, would be marked with an obelus (÷).

The was the cornerstone of the Great Library of Caesarea, which Origen founded. It was still the centerpiece of the library&#x27;s collection by the time of Jerome, who records having used it in his letters on multiple occasions. When Emperor Constantine the Great ordered fifty complete copies of the Bible to be transcribed and disseminated across the empire, Eusebius used the as the master copy for the Old Testament. Although the original has been lost, the text of it has survived in numerous fragments and a more-or-less complete Syriac translation of the Greek column, made by the seventh-century bishop Paul of Tella, has also survived. For some sections of the , Origen included additional columns containing other Greek translations; for the Book of Psalms, he included no less than eight Greek translations, making this section known as (&#x27;Ninefold&#x27;). Origen also produced the (&#x27;Fourfold&#x27;), a smaller, abridged version of the containing only the four Greek translations and not the original Hebrew text.

According to Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Epistle&quot; 33, Origen wrote extensive on the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Isaiah, Psalms 1–15, Ecclesiastes, and the Gospel of John. None of these have survived intact, but parts of them were incorporated into the , a collection of excerpts from major works of Biblical commentary written by the Church Fathers. Other fragments of the are preserved in Origen&#x27;s and in Pamphilus of Caesarea&#x27;s apology for Origen. The were of a similar character, and the margin of , 184, contains citations from this work on Romans 9:23; I Corinthians 6:14, 7:31, 34, 9:20–21, 10:9, besides a few other fragments. Origen composed homilies covering almost the entire Bible. There are 205, and possibly 279, homilies of Origen that are extant either in Greek or in Latin translations.

The homilies preserved are on Genesis (16), Exodus (13), Leviticus (16), Numbers (28), Joshua (26), Judges (9), I Sam. (2), Psalms 36–38 (9), Canticles (2), Isaiah (9), Jeremiah (7 Greek, 2 Latin, 12 Greek and Latin), Ezekiel (14), and Luke (39). The homilies were preached in the church at Caesarea, with the exception of the two on 1 Samuel which were delivered in Jerusalem. Nautin has argued that they were all preached in a three-year liturgical cycle some time between 238 and 244, preceding the &quot;Commentary on the Song of Songs&quot;, where Origen refers to homilies on Judges, Exodus, Numbers, and a work on Leviticus. On June 11, 2012, the Bavarian State Library announced that the Italian philologist Marina Molin Pradel had discovered twenty-nine previously unknown homilies by Origen in a twelfth-century Byzantine manuscript from their collection. Prof. Lorenzo Perrone of Bologna University and other experts confirmed the authenticity of the homilies. The texts of these manuscripts can be found online.

Origen is the main source of information on the use of the texts that were later officially canonized as the New Testament. The information used to create the late-fourth-century Easter Letter, which declared accepted Christian writings, was probably based on the lists given in Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; HE 3:25 and 6:25, which were both primarily based on information provided by Origen. Origen accepted the authenticity of the epistles of 1 John, 1 Peter, and Jude without question and accepted the Epistle of James as authentic with only slight hesitation. He also refers to 2 John, 3 John, and 2 Peter but notes that all three were suspected to be forgeries. Origen may have also considered other writings to be &quot;inspired&quot; that were rejected by later authors, including the Epistle of Barnabas, Shepherd of Hermas, and 1 Clement. &quot;Origen is not the originator of the idea of biblical canon, but he certainly gives the philosophical and literary–interpretative underpinnings for the whole notion.&quot;

===Extant commentaries===
Origen&#x27;s commentaries written on specific books of scripture are much more focused on systematic exegesis than his homilies. In these writings, Origen applies the precise critical methodology that had been developed by the scholars of the Mouseion in Alexandria to the Christian scriptures. The commentaries also display Origen&#x27;s impressive encyclopedic knowledge of various subjects and his ability to cross-reference specific words, listing every place in which a word appears in the scriptures along with all the word&#x27;s known meanings, a feat made all the more impressive by the fact that he did this in a time when Bible concordances had not yet been compiled. Origen&#x27;s massive &quot;Commentary on the Gospel of John&quot;, which spanned more than thirty-two volumes once it was completed, was written with the specific intention not only to expound the correct interpretation of the scriptures, but also to refute the interpretations of the Valentinian Gnostic teacher Heracleon, who had used the Gospel of John to support his argument that there were really two gods, not one. Of the original thirty-two books in the &quot;Commentary on John&quot;, only nine have been preserved: Books I, II, VI, X, XIII, XX, XXVIII, XXXII, and a fragment of XIX.

Of the original twenty-five books in Origen&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew&quot;, only eight have survived in the original Greek (Books 10–17), covering Matthew 13.36–22.33. An anonymous Latin translation beginning at the point corresponding to Book 12, Chapter 9 of the Greek text and covering Matthew 16.13–27.66 has also survived. The translation contains parts that are not found in the original Greek and is missing parts that are found in it. Origen&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew&quot; was universally regarded as a classic, even after his condemnation, and it ultimately became the work which established the Gospel of Matthew as the primary gospel. Origen&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans&quot; was originally fifteen books long, but only tiny fragments of it have survived in the original Greek. An abbreviated Latin translation in ten books was produced by the monk Tyrannius Rufinus at the end of the fourth century. The historian Socrates Scholasticus records that Origen had included an extensive discussion of the application of the title to the Virgin Mary in his commentary, but this discussion is not found in Rufinus&#x27;s translation, probably because Rufinus did not approve of Origen&#x27;s position on the matter, whatever that might have been.

Origen also composed a &quot;Commentary on the Song of Songs&quot;, in which he took explicit care to explain why the Song of Songs was relevant to a Christian audience. The &quot;Commentary on the Song of Songs&quot; was Origen&#x27;s most celebrated commentary and Jerome famously writes in his preface to his translation of two of Origen&#x27;s homilies over the Song of Songs that: &quot;In his other works, Origen habitually excels others. In this commentary, he excelled himself.&quot; Origen expanded on the exegesis of the Jewish Rabbi Akiva, interpreting the Song of Songs as a mystical allegory in which the bridegroom represents the Logos and the bride represents the soul of the believer. This was the first Christian commentary to expound such an interpretation and it became extremely influential on later interpretations of the Song of Songs. Despite this, the commentary now only survives in part through a Latin translation of it made by Tyrannius Rufinus in 410. Fragments of some other commentaries survive. Citations in Origen&#x27;s include fragments of the third book of the commentary on Genesis. There is also Ps. i, iv.1, the small commentary on Canticles, and the second book of the large commentary on the same, the twentieth book of the commentary on Ezekiel, and the commentary on Hosea. Of the non-extant commentaries, there is limited evidence of their arrangement.

===&quot;On the First Principles&quot;===
Origen&#x27;s &quot;On the First Principles&quot; was the first ever systematic exposition of Christian theology. He composed it as a young man between 220 and 230 while he was still living in Alexandria. Fragments from Books 3.1 and 4.1–3 of Origen&#x27;s Greek original are preserved in Origen&#x27;s . A few smaller quotations of the original Greek are preserved in Justinian&#x27;s &quot;Letter to Mennas&quot;. The vast majority of the text has only survived in a heavily abridged Latin translation produced by Tyrannius Rufinus in 397. &quot;On the First Principles&quot; begins with an essay explaining the nature of theology. Book One describes the heavenly world and includes descriptions of the oneness of God, the relationship between the three persons of the Trinity, the nature of the divine spirit, reason, and angels. Book Two describes the world of man, including the incarnation of the Logos, the soul, free will, and eschatology. Book Three deals with cosmology, sin, and redemption. Book Four deals with teleology and the interpretation of the scriptures.

===&quot;Against Celsus&quot;===
&quot;Against Celsus&quot; ( ; Latin: ), preserved entirely in Greek, was Origen&#x27;s last treatise, written about 248. It is an apologetic work defending orthodox Christianity against the attacks of the pagan philosopher Celsus, who was seen in the ancient world as early Christianity&#x27;s foremost opponent. In 178, Celsus had written a polemic entitled &quot;On the True Word&quot;, in which he had made numerous arguments against Christianity. The church had responded by ignoring Celsus&#x27;s attacks, but Origen&#x27;s patron Ambrose brought the matter to his attention. Origen initially wanted to ignore Celsus and let his attacks fade, but one of Celsus&#x27;s major claims, which held that no self-respecting philosopher of the Platonic tradition would ever be so stupid as to become a Christian, provoked him to write a rebuttal.

In the book, Origen systematically refutes each of Celsus&#x27;s arguments point by point and argues for a rational basis of Christian faith. Origen draws heavily on the teachings of Plato and argues that Christianity and Greek philosophy are not incompatible, and that philosophy contains much that is true and admirable, but that the Bible contains far greater wisdom than anything Greek philosophers could ever grasp. Origen responds to Celsus&#x27;s accusation that Jesus had performed his miracles using magic rather than divine powers by asserting that, unlike magicians, Jesus had not performed his miracles for show, but rather to reform his audiences. &quot;Against Celsus&quot; became the most influential of all early Christian apologetics works; before it was written, Christianity was seen by many as merely a folk religion for the illiterate and uneducated, but Origen raised it to a level of academic respectability. Eusebius admired &quot;Against Celsus&quot; so much that, in his &quot;Against Hierocles&quot; 1, he declared that &quot;Against Celsus&quot; provided an adequate rebuttal to all criticisms the church would ever face.

===Other writings===
Between 232 and 235, while in Caesarea in Palestine, Origen wrote &quot;On Prayer&quot;, of which the full text has been preserved in the original Greek. After an introduction on the object, necessity, and advantage of prayer, he ends with an exegesis of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, concluding with remarks on the position, place, and attitude to be assumed during prayer, as well as on the classes of prayer. &quot;On Martyrdom&quot;, or the &quot;Exhortation to Martyrdom&quot;, also preserved entire in Greek, was written some time after the beginning of the persecution of Maximinus in the first half of 235. In it, Origen warns against any trifling with idolatry and emphasises the duty of suffering martyrdom manfully, while in the second part he explains the meaning of martyrdom.

The papyri discovered at Tura in 1941 contained the Greek texts of two previously unknown works of Origen. Neither work can be dated precisely, though both were probably written after the persecution of Maximinus in 235. One is &quot;On the Pascha&quot;. The other is &quot;Dialogue with Heracleides&quot;, a record written by one of Origen&#x27;s stenographers of a debate between Origen and the Arabian bishop Heracleides, a quasi-Monarchianist who taught that the Father and the Son were the same. In the dialogue, Origen uses Socratic questioning to persuade Heracleides to believe in the &quot;Logos theology&quot;, in which the Son or Logos is a separate entity from God the Father. The debate between Origen and Heracleides, and Origen&#x27;s responses in particular, has been noted for its unusually cordial and respectful nature in comparison to the much fiercer polemics of Tertullian or the fourth-century debates between Trinitarians and Arians.

Lost works include two books on the Resurrection, written before &quot;On First Principles&quot;, and also two dialogues on the same theme dedicated to Ambrose. Eusebius had a collection of more than one hundred letters of Origen, and the list of Jerome speaks of several books of his epistles. Except for a few fragments, only three letters have been preserved. The first, partly preserved in the Latin translation of Rufinus, is addressed to friends in Alexandria. The second is a short letter to Gregory Thaumaturgus, preserved in the . The third is an epistle to Sextus Julius Africanus, extant in Greek, replying to a letter from Africanus (also extant), and defending the authenticity of the Greek additions to the book of Daniel.

Many works have been falsely ascribed to Origen. Forgeries of the writings of Origen made in his lifetime are discussed by Rufinus in . The , the attributed to Hippolytus of Rome, and the &quot;Commentary on Job&quot; by Julian the Arian have also been ascribed to him.

==Views==
===Christology===

Origen writes that Jesus was &quot;the firstborn of all creation [who] assumed a body and a human soul&quot;. He firmly believed that Jesus had a human soul and abhorred docetism (the teaching which held that Jesus had come to Earth in spirit form rather than a physical human body). Origen envisioned Jesus&#x27; human nature as the one soul that stayed closest to God and remained perfectly faithful to Him, even when all other souls fell away. At Jesus&#x27;s incarnation, his soul became fused with the Logos and they &quot;intermingled&quot; to become one. Thus, according to Origen, Christ was both human and divine, but like all human souls, Christ&#x27;s human nature was existent from the beginning.

Origen was the first to propose the ransom theory of atonement in its fully developed form, although Irenaeus had previously proposed a prototypical form of it. According to this theory, Christ&#x27;s death on the cross was a ransom to Satan in exchange for humanity&#x27;s liberation. This theory holds that Satan was tricked by God because Christ was not only free of sin, but also the incarnate Deity, whom Satan lacked the ability to enslave. The theory was later expanded by theologians such as Gregory of Nyssa and Rufinus of Aquileia. In the eleventh century, Anselm of Canterbury criticized the ransom theory, along with the associated Christus Victor theory, resulting in the theory&#x27;s decline in western Europe. The theory has nonetheless retained some of its popularity in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

===Cosmology and eschatology===
One of Origen&#x27;s main teachings was the doctrine of the preexistence of souls, which held that before God created the material world he created a vast number of incorporeal &quot;spiritual intelligences&quot; ( ). All of these souls were at first devoted to the contemplation and love of their Creator, but as the fervor of the divine fire cooled, almost all of these intelligences eventually grew bored of contemplating God, and their love for him &quot;cooled off&quot; ( ). When God created the world, the souls which had previously existed without bodies became incarnate. Those whose love for God diminished the most became demons. Those whose love diminished moderately became human souls, eventually to be incarnated in fleshly bodies. Those whose love diminished the least became angels.

One soul, however, who remained perfectly devoted to God became, through love, one with the Word (Logos) of God. The Logos eventually took flesh and was born of the Virgin Mary, becoming the God-man Jesus Christ. In recent years it has been questioned whether Origen believed this, being in reality a belief of his disciples and a misrepresentation by Justinian, Epiphanius and others.

Origen believed that, eventually, the whole world would be converted to Christianity, &quot;since the world is continually gaining possession of more souls&quot;. He believed that the Kingdom of Heaven was not yet come, but that it was the duty of every Christian to make the eschatological reality of the kingdom present in their lives. Origen is often believed to be a Universalist, who suggested that all people might eventually attain salvation, but only after being purged of their sins through &quot;divine fire&quot;. This, of course, in line of Origen&#x27;s allegorical interpretation, was not &quot;literal&quot; fire, but rather the inner anguish of knowing one&#x27;s own sins.

Origen was careful to maintain that universal salvation was merely a possibility and not a definitive doctrine, though he seemed strongly convinced that at least all human souls will be reunited to God in a final apokatastasis – the re-establishment of an original unity in creation – &quot;because the end is always like the beginning&quot; and because he believed all divine punishment to be medicinal. It is certain that Origen rejected the Stoic doctrine of eternal return, although he did posit the existence of a series of non-identical worlds. Jerome quotes Origen as having allegedly written that &quot;after aeons and the one restoration of all things, the state of Gabriel will be the same as that of the Devil, Paul&#x27;s as that of Caiaphas, that of virgins as that of prostitutes&quot;. However, Origen expressly states in his &quot;Letter to Friends in Alexandria&quot; that Satan and &quot;those who are cast out of the kingdom of God&quot; would not be included in the final salvation. Moreover, Origen often described a quite traditional fiery punishment in his homilies, considering the doctrine vital for the Christians who are not yet spiritually mature. On the other hand, he thought it sometimes necessary to admit the medicinal character of divine punishment to refute the notion of a cruel God.

A number of critics in the patristic era accused Origen of teaching that even the resurrection bodies would eventually vanish so that the souls could be united with the incorporeal God. In Rufinus&#x27;s favourable translation of &quot;On the First Principles&quot;, however, Origen repeatedly asserts that some kind of body is indispensable for created beings, although when contemplating the final end of all things, he offers three hypotheses – incorporeal existence, ethereal corporeality, or corporeality coming to rest in a stable part of the universe – leaving the reader to judge whichever is best. Nevertheless, based on other passages from his works, he probably preferred the third one. He seems to have believed that even the not yet resurrected souls of the departed possess bodies, albeit luminous ones, which explains ghost sightings. In discussing the resurrection bodies, he stressed Paul&#x27;s teaching about the spiritual body. Origen emphasized its vast superiority and difference from the current body to the point of arguing that it will lack teeth and other no longer needed parts. However, he insisted that our individual bodies will be recognizable thanks to a unique form (εἶδος), preserved by each of our immortal souls, that shapes and integrates each body.

Origen explicitly rejected &quot;the false doctrine of the transmigration of souls into bodies&quot;. But this may refer only to a specific kind of transmigration according to theologian Geddes MacGregor, who has argued that Origen must have believed in the Platonic teaching of (&#x27;transmigration of souls&#x27;; i.e. reincarnation) because it makes sense within his eschatology and is never explicitly denied in the Bible. Roger E. Olson, however, dismisses the view that Origen believed in reincarnation as a New Age misunderstanding of Origen&#x27;s teachings.

===Ethics===
Origen was an ardent believer in free will, and he adamantly rejected the Valentinian idea of election. Instead, Origen believed that even disembodied souls have the power to make their own decisions. Furthermore, in his interpretation of the story of Jacob and Esau, Origen argues that the condition into which a person is born is actually dependent upon what their souls did in this pre-existent state. According to Origen, the superficial unfairness of a person&#x27;s condition at birth—with some humans being poor, others rich, some being sick, and others healthy—is actually a by-product of what the person&#x27;s soul had done in the pre-existent state. Origen defends free will in his interpretations of instances of divine foreknowledge in the scriptures, arguing that Jesus&#x27;s knowledge of Judas&#x27;s future betrayal in the gospels and God&#x27;s knowledge of Israel&#x27;s future disobedience in the Deuteronomistic history only show that God knew these events would happen in advance. Origen therefore concludes that the individuals involved in these incidents still made their decisions out of their own free will. Like Plato, Plotinus and Gregory of Nyssa, Origen understands that only the agent who chooses the Good is free; choosing evil is never free but slavery.

Origen was an ardent pacifist, and in his &quot;Against Celsus&quot;, he argued that Christianity&#x27;s inherent pacifism was one of the most outwardly noticeable aspects of the religion. While Origen did admit that some Christians served in the Roman army, he pointed out that most did not and insisted that engaging in earthly wars was against the way of Christ. Origen accepted that it was sometimes necessary for a non-Christian state to wage wars but insisted that it was impossible for a Christian to fight in such a war without compromising his or her faith, since Christ had absolutely forbidden violence of any kind. Origen explained the violence found in certain passages of the Old Testament as allegorical and pointed out Old Testament passages which he interpreted as supporting nonviolence, such as Psalm 7:4–6 and Lamentations 3:27–29. Origen maintained that, if everyone were peaceful and loving like Christians, then there would be no wars and the Empire would not need a military.

===Hermeneutics===
Origen bases his theology on the Christian scriptures and does not appeal to Platonic teachings without having first supported his argument with a scriptural basis. He saw the scriptures as divinely inspired and was cautious never to contradict his own interpretation of what was written in them. Nonetheless, Origen did have a penchant for speculating beyond what was explicitly stated in the Bible, and this habit frequently placed him in the hazy realm between strict orthodoxy and heresy.

According to Origen, there are two kinds of Biblical literature which are found in both the Old and New Testaments: (&#x27;history&#x27; or &#x27;narrative&#x27;) and (&#x27;legislation&#x27; or &#x27;ethical prescription&#x27;). Origen expressly states that the Old and New Testaments should be read together and according to the same rules. Origen further taught that there were three different ways in which passages of scripture could be interpreted. The &quot;flesh&quot; was the literal, historical interpretation of the passage; the &quot;soul&quot; was the moral message behind the passage; and the &quot;spirit&quot; was the eternal, incorporeal reality that the passage conveyed. In Origen&#x27;s exegesis, the Book of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs represent perfect examples of the bodily, soulful, and spiritual components of scripture respectively.

Origen saw the &quot;spiritual&quot; interpretation as the deepest and most important meaning of the text and taught that some passages held no literal meaning at all and that their meanings were purely allegorical. Nonetheless, he stressed that &quot;the passages which are historically true are far more numerous than those which are composed with purely spiritual meanings&quot; and often used examples from corporeal realities. Origen noticed that the accounts of Jesus&#x27;s life in the four canonical gospels contain irreconcilable contradictions, but he argued that these contradictions did not undermine the spiritual meanings of the passages in question. Origen&#x27;s idea of a twofold creation was based on an allegorical interpretation of the creation story found in the first two chapters of the Book of Genesis. The first creation, described in Genesis 1:26, was the creation of the primeval spirits, who are made &quot;in the image of God&quot; and are therefore incorporeal like Him; the second creation described in Genesis 2:7 is when the human souls are given ethereal, spiritual bodies and the description in Genesis 3:21 of God clothing Adam and Eve in &quot;tunics of skin&quot; refers to the transformation of these spiritual bodies into corporeal ones. Thus, each phase represents a degradation from the original state of incorporeal holiness.

===Theology===
Origen&#x27;s conception of God the Father is apophatic—a perfect unity, invisible and incorporeal, transcending all things material, and therefore inconceivable and incomprehensible. He is likewise unchangeable and transcends space and time. But his power is limited by his goodness, justice, and wisdom; and, though entirely free from necessity, his goodness and omnipotence constrained him to reveal himself. This revelation, the external self-emanation of God, is expressed by Origen in various ways, the Logos being only one of many. The revelation was the first creation of God (cf. Proverbs 8:22), in order to afford creative mediation between God and the world, such mediation being necessary, because God, as changeless unity, could not be the source of a multitudinous creation.

The Logos is the rational creative principle that permeates the universe. The Logos acts on all human beings through their capacity for logic and rational thought, guiding them to the truth of God&#x27;s revelation. As they progress in their rational thinking, all humans become more like Christ. Nonetheless, they retain their individuality and do not become subsumed into Christ. Creation came into existence only through the Logos, and God&#x27;s nearest approach to the world is the command to create. While the Logos is substantially a unity, he comprehends a multiplicity of concepts, so that Origen terms him, in Platonic fashion, &quot;essence of essences&quot; and &quot;idea of ideas&quot;.

The focused understanding of the Logos, along with the paradigms of participation carried from Greek philosophy, allowed Origen to have a major role in the development of the concept of human deification or . Origen believed that Christ&#x27;s humanity was deified and this deification spread to all the believers. By participating in the very Logos himself, we become participants in divinity. Origen, however, concluded that only those who are created in God&#x27;s image and live a life of virtue can deified; virtue for Origen is linked to the person of Jesus Christ. Thus, he excluded all inanimate objects or animals (previously seen as divine in some pagan polytheistic systems), and also excluded the pagan heroes from this perceived deification.

Origen significantly contributed to the development of the idea of the Trinity. He declared the Holy Spirit to be a part of the Godhead and interpreted the Parable of the Lost Coin to mean that the Holy Spirit dwells within each and every person and that the inspiration of the Holy Spirit was necessary for any kind of speech dealing with God. Origen taught that the activity of all three parts of the Trinity was necessary for a person to attain salvation.

In one fragment preserved by Rufinus in his Latin translation of Pamphilus&#x27;s &quot;Defense of Origen&quot;, Origen seems to apply the phrase ( &#x27;of the same substance&#x27;) to the relationship between the Father and the Son. But Williams states that it is impossible to verify whether the quote that uses the word really comes from Pamphilus at all, let alone Origen.

In other passages, Origen rejected the belief that the Son and the Father were one as heretical. According to Rowan Williams, because the words and were used synonymously in Origen&#x27;s time, Origen almost certainly would have rejected , as a description for the relationship between the Father and the Son, as heretical.

Nonetheless, Origen was a subordinationist, meaning he believed that the Father was superior to the Son and the Son was superior to the Holy Spirit, a model based on Platonic proportions. Jerome records that Origen had written that God the Father is invisible to all beings, including even the Son and the Holy Spirit, and that the Son is invisible to the Holy Spirit as well. At one point Origen suggests that the Son was created by the Father and that the Holy Spirit was created by the Son, but, at another point, he writes that: &quot;Up to the present I have been able to find no passage in the Scriptures that the Holy Spirit is a created being.&quot; At the time when Origen was alive, orthodox views on the Trinity had not yet been formulated and subordinationism was not yet considered heretical. In fact, virtually all orthodox theologians prior to the Arian controversy in the latter half of the fourth century were subordinationists to some extent. Origen&#x27;s subordinationism may have developed out of his efforts to defend the unity of God against the Gnostics.

==Influence on the Later Church==
===Before the Crises===
Origen is often seen as the first major Christian theologian. Though his orthodoxy had been questioned in Alexandria while he was alive, after Origen&#x27;s death Pope Dionysius of Alexandria became one of the foremost proponents of Origen&#x27;s theology. Every Christian theologian who came after him was influenced by his theology, whether directly or indirectly. Origen&#x27;s contributions to theology were so vast and complex, however, that his followers frequently emphasized drastically different parts of his teachings to the expense of other parts. Dionysius emphasized Origen&#x27;s subordinationist views, which led Dionysius to deny the unity of the Trinity, causing controversy throughout North Africa. At the same time, Origen&#x27;s other disciple Theognostus of Alexandria taught that the Father and the Son were &quot;of one substance&quot;.

For centuries after his death, Origen was regarded as the bastion of orthodoxy, and his philosophy practically defined Eastern Christianity. Origen was revered as one of the greatest of all Christian teachers; he was especially beloved by monks, who saw themselves as continuing in Origen&#x27;s ascetic legacy. As time progressed, however, Origen became criticized under the standard of orthodoxy in later eras, rather than the standards of his own lifetime. In the early fourth century, the Christian writer Methodius of Olympus criticized some of Origen&#x27;s more speculative arguments but otherwise agreed with Origen on all other points of theology. Peter of Antioch and Eustathius of Antioch criticized Origen as heretical.

Both orthodox and heterodox theologians claimed to be following in the tradition Origen had established. Athanasius of Alexandria, the most prominent supporter of the Holy Trinity at the First Council of Nicaea, was deeply influenced by Origen, and so were Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus (the &quot;Cappadocian Fathers&quot;). At the same time, Origen deeply influenced Arius of Alexandria and later followers of Arianism. Although the extent of the relationship between the two is debated, in antiquity, many orthodox Christians believed that Origen was the true and ultimate source of the Arian heresy.

===First Origenist Crisis===

The First Origenist Crisis began in the late fourth century, coinciding with the beginning of monasticism in Palestine. The first stirring of the controversy came from the Cyprian bishop Epiphanius of Salamis, who was determined to root out all heresies and refute them. Epiphanius attacked Origen in his anti-heretical treatises (375) and (376), compiling a list of teachings Origen had espoused that Epiphanius regarded as heretical. Epiphanius&#x27;s treatises portray Origen as an originally orthodox Christian who had been corrupted and turned into a heretic by the evils of &quot;Greek education&quot;. Epiphanius particularly objected to Origen&#x27;s subordinationism, his &quot;excessive&quot; use of allegorical hermeneutic, and his habit of proposing ideas about the Bible &quot;speculatively, as exercises&quot; rather than &quot;dogmatically&quot;.

Epiphanius asked John, the bishop of Jerusalem, to condemn Origen as a heretic. John refused on the grounds that a person could not be retroactively condemned as a heretic after that person had already died. In 393, a monk named Atarbius advanced a petition to have Origen and his writings censured. Tyrannius Rufinus, a priest at the monastery on the Mount of Olives who had been ordained by John of Jerusalem and was a longtime admirer of Origen, rejected the petition outright. Rufinus&#x27;s close friend and associate Jerome, who had also studied Origen, however, came to agree with the petition. Around the same time, John Cassian, an Eastern monk, introduced Origen&#x27;s teachings to the West.

In 394, Epiphanius wrote to John of Jerusalem, again asking for Origen to be condemned, insisting that Origen&#x27;s writings denigrated human sexual reproduction and accusing him of having been an Encratite. John once again denied this request. By 395, Jerome had allied himself with the anti-Origenists and begged John of Jerusalem to condemn Origen, a plea which John once again refused. Epiphanius launched a campaign against John, openly preaching that John was an Origenist deviant. He successfully persuaded Jerome to break communion with John and ordained Jerome&#x27;s brother Paulinianus as a priest in defiance of John&#x27;s authority.

In 397, Rufinus published a Latin translation of Origen&#x27;s &quot;On First Principles&quot;. Rufinus was convinced that Origen&#x27;s original treatise had been interpolated by heretics and that these interpolations were the source of the heterodox teachings found in it. He therefore heavily modified Origen&#x27;s text, omitting and altering any parts which disagreed with contemporary Christian orthodoxy. In the introduction to this translation, Rufinus mentioned that Jerome had studied under Origen&#x27;s disciple Didymus the Blind, implying that Jerome was a follower of Origen. Jerome was so incensed by this that he resolved to produce his own Latin translation of &quot;On the First Principles&quot;, in which he promised to translate every word exactly as it was written and lay bare Origen&#x27;s heresies to the whole world. Jerome&#x27;s translation has been lost in its entirety.

In 399, the Origenist crisis reached Egypt. Pope Theophilus I of Alexandria was sympathetic to the supporters of Origen and the church historian, Sozomen, records that he had openly preached the Origenist teaching that God was incorporeal. In his &quot;Festal Letter&quot; of 399, he denounced those who believed that God had a literal, human-like body, calling them illiterate &quot;simple ones&quot;. A large mob of Alexandrian monks who regarded God as anthropomorphic rioted in the streets. According to the church historian Socrates Scholasticus, in order to prevent a riot, Theophilus made a sudden about-face and began denouncing Origen. In 400, Theophilus summoned a council in Alexandria, which condemned Origen and all his followers as heretics for having taught that God was incorporeal, which they decreed contradicted the only true and orthodox position, which was that God had a literal, physical body resembling that of a human.

Theophilus labeled Origen as the &quot;hydra of all heresies&quot; and persuaded Pope Anastasius I to sign the letter of the council, which primarily denounced the teachings of the Nitrian monks associated with Evagrius Ponticus. In 402, Theophilus expelled Origenist monks from Egyptian monasteries and banished the four monks known as the &quot;Tall Brothers&quot;, who were leaders of the Nitrian community. John Chrysostom, the patriarch of Constantinople, granted the Tall Brothers asylum, a fact which Theophilus used to orchestrate John&#x27;s condemnation and removal from his position at the Synod of the Oak in July 403. Once John Chrysostom had been deposed, Theophilus restored normal relations with the Origenist monks in Egypt and the first Origenist crisis came to an end.

===Second Origenist Crisis===

The Second Origenist Crisis occurred in the sixth century, during the height of Byzantine monasticism. Although the Second Origenist Crisis is not nearly as well documented as the first, it seems to have primarily concerned the teachings of Origen&#x27;s later followers, rather than what Origen had written. Origen&#x27;s disciple Evagrius Ponticus had advocated contemplative, noetic prayer, but other monastic communities prioritized asceticism in prayer, emphasizing fasting, labors, and vigils. Some Origenist monks in Palestine, referred to by their enemies as &quot;&quot; (meaning &#x27;those who would assume equality with Christ&#x27;), emphasized Origen&#x27;s teaching of the pre-existence of souls and held that all souls were originally equal to Christ&#x27;s and would become equal again at the end of time. Another faction of Origenists in the same region instead insisted that Christ was the &quot;leader of many brethren&quot;, as the first-created being. This faction was more moderate, and they were referred to by their opponents as &quot;&quot; (&#x27;[those] first created&#x27;). Both factions accused the other of heresy, and other Christians accused both of them of heresy.

The Protoktistoi appealed to the Emperor Justinian I to condemn the Isochristoi of heresy through Pelagius, the papal . In 543, Pelagius presented Justinian with documents, including a letter denouncing Origen written by Patriarch Mennas of Constantinople, along with excerpts from Origen&#x27;s &quot;On First Principles&quot; and several anathemata against Origen. A domestic synod convened to address the issue concluded that the Isochristoi&#x27;s teachings were heretical and, seeing Origen as the ultimate culprit behind the heresy, denounced Origen as a heretic as well. Emperor Justinian ordered for all of Origen&#x27;s writings to be burned. In the west, the , which was written sometime between 519 and 553, listed Origen as an author whose writings were to be categorically banned.

In 553, during the early days of the Second Council of Constantinople (the Fifth Ecumenical Council), when Pope Vigilius was still refusing to take part in it despite Justinian holding him hostage, the bishops at the council ratified an open letter which condemned Origen as the leader of the Isochristoi. The letter was not part of the official acts of the council, and it more or less repeated the edict issued by the Synod of Constantinople in 543. It cites objectionable writings attributed to Origen, but all the writings referred to in it were actually written by Evagrius Ponticus. After the council officially opened, but while Pope Vigillius was still refusing to take part, Justinian presented the bishops with the problem of a text known as &quot;The Three Chapters&quot;, which attacked the Antiochene Christology.

The bishops drew up a list of anathemata against the heretical teachings contained within &quot;The Three Chapters&quot; and those associated with them. In the official text of the eleventh anathema, Origen is condemned as a Christological heretic, but Origen&#x27;s name does not appear at all in the , the first draft of the anathemata issued by the imperial chancery, nor does it appear in the version of the conciliar proceedings that was eventually signed by Pope Vigillius, a long time afterwards. Norman P. Tanner&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils&quot; (Georgetown University Press, 1990) says: &quot;Our edition does not include the text of the anathemas against Origen since recent studies have shown that these anathemas cannot be attributed to this council.&quot; These discrepancies may indicate that Origen&#x27;s name was retrospectively inserted into the text after the council. Some authorities believe these anathemata belong to an earlier local synod. Even if Origen&#x27;s name did appear in the original text of the anathema, the teachings attributed to Origen that are condemned in the anathema were actually the ideas of later Origenists, which had very little grounding in anything Origen had actually written. In fact, Popes Vigilius, Pelagius I, Pelagius II, and Gregory the Great were only aware that the Fifth Council specifically dealt with &quot;The Three Chapters&quot; and make no mention of Origenism or universalism, nor spoke as if they knew of its condemnation—even though Gregory the Great was opposed to universalism.

===After the Anathemas===

As a direct result of the numerous condemnations of his work, only a tiny fraction of Origen&#x27;s voluminous writings have survived. Nonetheless, these writings still amount to a massive number of Greek and Latin texts, very few of which have yet been translated into English. Many more writings have survived in fragments through quotations from later Church Fathers. Even in the late 14th century, Francesc Eiximenis in his Llibre de les dones, produced otherwise unknown quotations from Origen, which may be evidence of other works surviving into the Late Medieval period. It is likely that the writings containing Origen&#x27;s most unusual and speculative ideas have been lost to time, making it nearly impossible to determine whether Origen actually held the heretical views which the anathemas against him ascribed to him. Nonetheless, in spite of the decrees against Origen, the church remained enamored of him and he remained a central figure of Christian theology throughout the first millennium. He continued to be revered as the founder of Biblical exegesis, and anyone in the first millennium who took the interpretation of the scriptures seriously would have had knowledge of Origen&#x27;s teachings.

Jerome&#x27;s Latin translations of Origen&#x27;s homilies were widely read in western Europe throughout the Middle Ages, and Origen&#x27;s teachings greatly influenced those of the Byzantine monk Maximus the Confessor and the Irish theologian John Scotus Eriugena. Since the Renaissance, the debate over Origen&#x27;s orthodoxy has continued to rage. Basilios Bessarion, a Greek refugee who fled to Italy after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, produced a Latin translation of Origen&#x27;s &quot;Against Celsus&quot;, which was printed in 1481. Major controversy erupted in 1487, after the Italian humanist scholar Giovanni Pico della Mirandola issued a thesis arguing that &quot;it is more reasonable to believe that Origen was saved than he was damned&quot;. A papal commission condemned Pico&#x27;s position on account of the anathemas against Origen, but not until after the debate had received considerable attention.

The most prominent advocate of Origen during the Renaissance was the Dutch humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus, who regarded Origen as the greatest of all Christian authors and wrote in a letter to John Eck that he learned more about Christian philosophy from a single page of Origen than from ten pages of Augustine. Erasmus especially admired Origen for his lack of rhetorical flourishes, which were so common in the writings of other Patristic authors. Erasmus borrowed heavily from Origen&#x27;s defense of free will in &quot;On First Principles&quot; in his 1524 treatise &quot;On Free Will&quot;, now considered his most important theological work. In 1527, Erasmus translated and published the portion of Origen&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew&quot; that survived only in Greek and in 1536, he published the most complete edition of Origen&#x27;s writings that had ever been published at that time. While Origen&#x27;s emphasis on the human effort in attaining salvation appealed to the Renaissance humanists, it made him far less appealing to the proponents of the Reformation. Martin Luther deplored Origen&#x27;s understanding of salvation as irredeemably defective and declared &quot;in all of Origen there is not one word about Christ&quot;. Consequently, he ordered for Origen&#x27;s writings to be banned. Nonetheless, the earlier Czech reformer Jan Hus had taken inspiration from Origen for his view that the church is a spiritual reality rather than an official hierarchy, and Luther&#x27;s contemporary, the Swiss reformer Huldrych Zwingli, took inspiration from Origen for his interpretation of the Eucharist as symbolic.

In the seventeenth century, the English Cambridge Platonist Henry More was a devoted Origenist, and although he did reject the notion of universal salvation, he accepted most of Origen&#x27;s other teachings. Pope Benedict XVI expressed admiration for Origen, describing him in a sermon as part of a series on the Church Fathers as &quot;a figure crucial to the whole development of Christian thought&quot;, &quot;a true &#x27;maestro, and &quot;not only a brilliant theologian but also an exemplary witness of the doctrine he passed on&quot;. He concludes the sermon by inviting his audience to &quot;welcome into your hearts the teaching of this great master of the faith&quot;. Modern Protestant evangelicals admire Origen for his passionate devotion to the scriptures but are frequently baffled or even appalled by his allegorical interpretation of them, which many believe ignores the literal, historical truth behind them.

Origen is often noted for being one of the few Church Fathers who is not generally regarded as a saint. Nevertheless, there are notable individuals who referred to Origen as St. Origen. This includes Anglicans such as Edward Welchman, John Howson and Sir Winston Churchill; Calvinists such as Pierre Bayle, Georges-Louis Liomin and Heinrich Bullinger; American scholar and Orthodox Christian David Bentley Hart; Oriental Orthodox such as Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria, Fr. Tadros Yakoup Malaty and the Coptic Orthodox Diocese of the Southern United States. Origen&#x27;s father, Saint Leonides of Alexandria, has a feast day on April 22 in the Catholic tradition, and the Evangelical Church in Germany celebrates April 27 as Origen&#x27;s feast day.

<text>The &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; class is a class of guided-missile frigates named after U.S. Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, a commander noted for his role in the Battle of Lake Erie. Also known as the &quot;Perry&quot; or FFG-7 (commonly &quot;fig seven&quot;) class, the warships were designed in the United States in the mid-1970s as general-purpose escort vessels inexpensive enough to be bought in large numbers to replace World War II-era destroyers and complement 1960s-era s.

In Admiral Elmo Zumwalt&#x27;s &quot;high low fleet plan&quot;, the FFG-7s were the low-capability ships, with the s serving as the high-capability ships. Intended to protect amphibious landing forces, supply and replenishment groups, and merchant convoys from aircraft and submarines, they were also later part of battleship-centered surface action groups and aircraft carrier battle groups/strike groups. 55 ships were built in the United States: 51 for the United States Navy and four for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Eight were built in Taiwan, six in Spain, and two in Australia for their navies. Former U.S. Navy warships of this class have been sold or donated to the navies of Bahrain, Egypt, Poland, Pakistan, Taiwan, and Turkey.

The first of the 51 U.S. Navy-built &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; frigates entered into service in 1977, and the last remaining in active service, , was decommissioned on 29 September 2015. The retired vessels were mostly mothballed with some transferred to other navies for continued service and some used as weapons targets and sunk. Some of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s frigates, such as USS &quot;Duncan&quot; (14.6 years in service), had fairly short careers, while a few lasted as long as 30+ years in active U.S. service, with some lasting even longer after being sold or donated to other navies. In 2020, the Navy announced the new as their latest class of frigates.

==Design and construction==

The ships were designed by the Bath Iron Works shipyard in Maine in partnership with the New York-based naval architects Gibbs &amp; Cox. The design process was notable as the initial design was accomplished with the help of computers in 18 hours by Raye Montague, a civilian U.S. Navy naval engineer, making it the first ship designed by computer.

The &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class ships were produced in long &quot;short-hull&quot; (Flight I) and long &quot;long-hull&quot; (Flight III) variants. The long-hull ships (FFG 8, 28, 29, 32, 33, and 36–61) carry the larger SH-60 Seahawk LAMPS III helicopters, while the short-hulled warships carry the smaller and less-capable SH-2 Seasprite LAMPS I. Aside from the lengths of their hulls, the principal difference between the versions is the location of the aft capstan: on long-hull ships, it sits a step below the level of the flight deck to provide clearance for the tail rotor of the longer Seahawk helicopters.

The long-hull ships carry the RAST (Recovery Assist Securing and Traversing) system (also known as a Beartrap (hauldown device)) for the Seahawk. It is a hook, cable, and winch system that can reel in a Seahawk from a hovering flight, expanding the ship&#x27;s pitch-and-roll range in which flight operations are permitted. The FFG 8, 29, 32, and 33 were built as &quot;short-hull&quot; warships but were later modified into &quot;long-hull&quot; warships.

&quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigates were the second class of surface ships (after the s) in the U.S. Navy to be built with gas turbine propulsion. The gas turbine propulsion plant was more automated than other Navy propulsion plants at the time, and it could be centrally monitored and controlled from a remote engineering control center away from the engines. The gas turbine propulsion plants also allowed the ship&#x27;s speed to be controlled directly from the bridge via a throttle control, a first for the U.S. Navy.

American shipyards constructed &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class ships for the U.S. Navy and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Early American-built Australian ships were originally built as the &quot;short-hull&quot; version, but they were modified during the 1980s to the &quot;long-hull&quot; design. Shipyards in Australia, Spain, and Taiwan have produced several warships of the &quot;long-hull&quot; design for their navies.

Although the per-ship costs rose greatly over the period of production, all 51 ships planned for the U.S. Navy were built.

During the design phase of the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; class, the head of the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors, R.J. Daniels, was invited by an old friend, U.S. Chief of the Bureau of Ships, Adm Robert C Gooding, to advise upon the use of variable-pitch propellers in the class. During this conversation, Daniels warned Gooding against the use of aluminium in the superstructure of the FFG-7 class as he believed it would lead to structural weaknesses. A number of ships subsequently developed structural cracks, including a fissure in USS &quot;Duncan&quot;, before the problems were remedied.

The &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigates were designed primarily as anti-aircraft and anti-submarine warfare guided-missile warships intended to provide open-ocean escort of amphibious warfare ships and merchant ship convoys in moderate threat environments in a potential war with the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact countries. They could also provide air defense against 1970s- and 1980s-era aircraft and anti-ship missiles. These warships are equipped to escort and protect aircraft carrier battle groups, amphibious landing groups, underway replenishment groups, and merchant ship convoys. They can conduct independent operations to perform tasks such as surveillance of illegal drug smugglers, maritime interception operations, and exercises with other nations.

The addition of the Naval Tactical Data System, LAMPS helicopters, and the Tactical Towed Array System (TACTAS) gave these warships a combat capability far beyond the original expectations. They are well suited for operations in and most war-at-sea scenarios.

==Notable combat actions==
&quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigates made worldwide news during the 1980s. Despite being small, these frigates were shown to be very durable. During the Iran–Iraq War, on 17 May 1987, was attacked by an Iraqi warplane. Struck by two Exocet anti-ship missiles, thirty-seven U.S. Navy sailors died in the deadly prelude to the American Operation Earnest Will, the reflagging and escorting of oil tankers through the Persian Gulf and the Straits of Hormuz.

Less than a year later, on 14 April 1988, was nearly sunk by an Iranian mine. There were no deaths, but ten sailors were evacuated from the warship for medical treatment. The crew of &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; battled fire and flooding for two days, ultimately managing to save the ship. The U.S. Navy retaliated four days later with Operation Praying Mantis, a one-day attack on Iranian oil platforms being used as bases for raids on merchant shipping. Those had included bases for the minelaying operations that damaged &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot;. &quot;Stark&quot; and &quot;Roberts&quot; were each repaired in American shipyards and returned to full service. &quot;Stark&quot; was decommissioned in 1999 and scrapped in 2006. &quot;Roberts&quot; was decommissioned at Mayport on 22 May 2015.

On 18 April 1988, was accompanying the cruiser and frigate when they came under attack from the Iranian gunboat , which fired a U.S.-made Harpoon anti-ship missile at the ships. With &quot;Simpson&quot; having the only clear shot, the frigate fired an SM-1 standard missile, which struck &quot;Joshan&quot;. &quot;Simpson&quot; fired three more SM-1s, and with later naval fire from &quot;Wainwright&quot;, sank the Iranian vessel.

===Durability===
On 14 July 2016, the ex- took over 12 hours to sink after being used in a live fire, SINKEX during naval exercise RIMPAC 2016. During the exercise, the ship was directly or indirectly hit with the following ordnance: a Harpoon missile from a South Korean submarine, another Harpoon missile from the Australian frigate , a Hellfire missile from an Australian MH-60R helicopter, another Harpoon missile and a Maverick missile from U.S. maritime patrol aircraft, another Harpoon missile from the cruiser , additional Hellfire missiles from a U.S. Navy MH-60S helicopter, a 900 kg (2,000 lb) Mark 84 bomb from a U.S. Navy F/A-18 Hornet, a GBU-12 Paveway laser-guided 225 kg (500 lb) bomb from a U.S. Air Force B-52 bomber, and a Mark 48 torpedo from an unnamed U.S. Navy submarine.

==Modifications==
===United States===
The United States Navy and Royal Australian Navy modified their remaining &quot;Perry&quot;s to reduce their operating costs, replacing Detroit Diesel 16V149TI electrical generators with Caterpillar 3512B diesel engines.

Upgrades to the &quot;Perry&quot; class were problematic due to &quot;little reserved space for growth (39 tons in the original design), and the inflexible, proprietary electronics of the time&quot;, such that the &quot;US Navy gave up on the idea of upgrades to face new communications realities and advanced missile threats&quot;. The U.S. Navy decommissioned 25 &quot;FFG-7 Short&quot; ships via &quot;bargain basement sales to allies or outright retirement, after an average of only 18 years of service&quot;.

From 2004 to 2005, the U.S. Navy removed the frigates&#x27; Mk 13 single-arm missile launchers because the primary missile, the Standard SM-1MR, had become outmoded. It would supposedly have been too costly to refit the Standard SM-1MR missiles, which had little ability to bring down sea-skimming missiles. Another reason was to allow more SM-1MRs to go to American allies that operated &quot;Perry&quot;s, such as Poland, Spain, Australia, Turkey, and Taiwan. As a result, the &quot;zone-defense&quot; anti-aircraft warfare (AAW) capability of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s &quot;Perry&quot;s had vanished, and all that remained was a &quot;point-defense&quot; type of anti-air warfare armament, so they relied upon cover from AEGIS destroyers and cruisers.

The removal of the Mk 13 launchers also stripped the frigates of their Harpoon anti-ship missiles. However, their Seahawk helicopters could still carry the much shorter-range Penguin and Hellfire anti-ship missiles. The last nine ships of the class had new remotely operated 25 mm Mk 38 Mod 2 Machine Gun Systems (MGSs) installed on platforms over the old Mk 13 launcher magazine.


Up to 2002, the U.S. Navy updated the remaining active &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class warships&#x27; Phalanx CIWS to the &quot;Block 1B&quot; capability, which allowed the Mk 15 20 mm Phalanx gun to shoot at fast-moving surface craft and helicopters. They were also to have been fitted with the Mk 53 Decoy Launching System &quot;Nulka&quot; in place of the SRBOC (Super Rapid Blooming Offboard Chaff) and flares, which would have better protected the ship against anti-ship missiles. It was planned to outfit the remaining ships with a 21-cell RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile launcher at the location of the former Mk 13, but this did not occur.

On 11 May 2009, the first International Frigate Working Group met at Mayport Naval Station to discuss maintenance, obsolescence, and logistics issues regarding &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class ships of the U.S. and foreign navies.

On 16 June 2009, Vice Admiral Barry McCullough turned down the suggestion of then-U.S. Senator Mel Martinez (R-FL) to keep the &quot;Perry&quot;s in service, citing their worn-out and maxed-out condition. However, U.S. Representative Ander Crenshaw (R-FL) and former U.S. Representative Gene Taylor (D-MS) took up the cause to retain the vessels.

The &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigates were to have been eventually replaced by Littoral Combat Ships by 2019. However, the worn-out frigates were being retired faster than the LCSs were being built, which may lead to a gap in United States Southern Command mission coverage. According to Navy deactivation plans, all &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigates would be retired by October 2015. &quot;Simpson&quot; was the last to be retired (on 29 September 2015), leaving the Navy devoid of frigates for the first time since 1943. The ships will either be made available for sale to foreign navies or dismantled.

&quot;Perry&quot;-class frigate retirement was accelerated by budget pressures, leading to the remaining 11 ships being replaced by only eight LCS hulls. With the timeline LCS mission packages will come online unknown, there is uncertainty if they will be able to perform the frigates&#x27; counter-narcotics and anti-submarine roles when they are gone. The Navy is looking into Military Sealift Command to see if the Joint High Speed Vessel, Mobile Landing Platform, and other auxiliary ships could handle low-end missions that the frigates performed.

The U.S. Coast Guard harvested weapons systems components from decommissioned Navy &quot;Perry&quot;-class frigates to save money. Harvesting components from four decommissioned frigates resulted in more than $24 million in cost savings, which increases with parts from more decommissioned frigates. Equipment including Mk 75 76 mm/62 caliber gun mounts, gun control panels, barrels, launchers, junction boxes, and other components was returned to service aboard s to extend their service lives into the 2030s.

In June 2017, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson revealed the Navy was &quot;taking a hard look&quot; at reactivating 7-8 out of 12 mothballed &quot;Perry&quot;-class frigates to increase fleet numbers. While the move was under consideration, there would be difficulties in returning them to service given the age of the ships and their equipment, likely requiring a significant modernization effort. Although bringing the frigates out of retirement would have provided a short-term solution to fleet size, their limited combat capability would restrict them to acting as a theater security cooperation, maritime security asset. Their likely role would have been serving as basic surface platforms that stay close to U.S. shores, performing missions such as assisting drug interdiction efforts or patrolling the Arctic so an extensive upgrade to the ships&#x27; combat systems would not need to be undertaken. An October 2017 memo recommended against reactivating the frigates, claiming it would cost too much money, taking funding away from other Navy priorities for ships with little effectiveness.

===Australia===

Australia spent A$1.46bn to upgrade the Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s (RAN) guided-missile frigates, including equipping them to fire the SM-2 version of the Standard missile, adding an eight-cell Mark 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) for Evolved SeaSparrow Missiles (ESSMs), and installing better air-search radars and long-range sonar. The RAN had opted to retain their &quot;Adelaide&quot; frigates rather than purchase the U.S. Navy&#x27;s destroyers; the &quot;Kidd&quot;s were more capable but more expensive and manpower intensive. However, the upgrade project ran over budget and fell behind schedule.

The first of the upgraded frigates, , returned to the RAN fleet in 2005. Four frigates were eventually upgraded at the Garden Island shipyard in Sydney, Australia, with the modernizations lasting between 18 months and two years. The cost of the upgrades was partly offset, in the short run, by the decommissioning and disposal of the two older frigates. was decommissioned on 12 November 2005 at naval base in Western Australia, and was decommissioned at that same naval base on 20 January 2008. HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot; was decommissioned at the Garden Island naval base in 2016. HMAS Darwin was also decommissioned at Garden Island in 2018.

The &quot;Adelaide&quot;-class frigates were replaced by three spanish designed &quot;Hobart&quot;-class air warfare destroyers equipped with the AEGIS combat system. HMAS &quot;Melbourne&quot; and &quot;Newcastle&quot; were transferred in May 2020 to the Chilean Navy and serve as &quot;Captain Prat&quot; and &quot;Almirante Latorre&quot;.

===Turkey===
The G-class frigates of the Turkish Navy have undergone a major modernisation program, which included the retrofitting of a Turkish digital combat management system named GENESIS (&quot;Gemi Entegre Savaş İdare Sistemi&quot;). The system was designed &amp; implemented jointly by the Turkish Navy &amp; HAVELSAN, a Turkish electronic hardware systems &amp; software company. The GENESIS upgraded ships were delivered between 2007 &amp; 2011.

The GENESIS advanced combat management system has the capacity of tracking more than 1,000 tactical targets, thanks to its digital sensor data fusion, automatic threat evaluation, weapon engagement opportunities, and Link-16/22 system integration.

The modernisation program also included the addition of an 8-cell Mk.41 VLS for RIM-162 ESSM, together with the upgrade of the Mk-92 fire control system by Lockheed Martin; the retrofitting of the SMART-S Mk2 3D air search radar, which replaced the AN/SPS-49; and the addition of a new, long range sonar.

The Mk.41 vertical launching system (VLS) has been fitted in front of the Mk.13 launcher. TCG &quot;Gediz&quot; was the first ship in the class to receive the Mk.41 VLS installation.

The G-class frigates of the Turkish Navy were also modified with the ASIST landing platform system at the Istanbul Naval Shipyard, so that they can accommodate the S-70B Seahawk helicopter.

==Operators==

*: was purchased from the American government in 1996 and re-christened .
* Chile: On 27 December 2019, it was announced that Australia had sold and to Chile. Both frigates were delivered to the Chilean Navy in May 2020 and named &quot;Capitan Prat&quot; and &quot;Almirante Latorre&quot;.
*: Four &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigates were transferred from the U.S. Navy between 1996 and 1999.
*: The former transferred to the Pakistani Navy as PNS &quot;Alamgir&quot; (F260) in August 2010.
*: Two frigates were transferred from the U.S. Navy in 2000 and 2002.
* (): Spanish-built: six frigates.
* (): Taiwanese-built. Originally, eight ships were equipped with eight Hsiung Feng II anti-ship missiles. Now, all but PFG-1103 are carrying four HF-2 and four HF-3 supersonic AShM. The PFG-1103 &quot;Cheng Ho&quot; will change the anti-ship mix upon their major overhaul. Seven out of eight ships added Bofors 40 mm/L70 guns for both surface and anti-air use. On 5 November 2012, Minister of Defense Kao announced the U.S. government would sell Taiwan two additional &quot;Perry&quot;-class frigates that are about to be retired from the U.S. Navy for a cost of US$240 million to be retrofitted and delivered in 2015. The ex-USS &quot;Gary&quot; and the ex-USS &quot;Taylor&quot; were to be reactivated and transferred to Taiwan. In July 2016, the U.S. Naval Sea Systems Command awarded a $74 million contract to Virginia-based VSE Corporation to do the work. According to the contract, VSE had 16 months to complete the work. The U.S. State Department officially approved the sale of both ships for $190 million in March 2016. The ships were commissioned into ROCN service on 8 November 2018.
* (): Eight former U.S. Navy &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigates were transferred to the Turkish Navy between 1998 and 2003. All have undergone extensive advanced modernization programs, and they are now known as the G-class frigates. The Turkish Navy modernized G-class frigates have an additional Mk 41 VLS capable of launching ESSMs for closer-in defense and longer-range SM-1 missiles, advanced digital fire control systems, and new Turkish-made sonars.

===Potential operators===
*: Two former U.S. Navy &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigates and were to be sold to the Mexican Navy under the FMS program; however, was sunk as a target during RIMPAC 2018 on 19 July 2018 and was sunk as a target during Valiant Shield 2020 on 19 September 2020.
*: Two former U.S. Navy &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigates were allocated by the U.S. government to the Royal Thai Navy, subject to acceptance by the Thai government: the former and . This transfer was not carried out; &quot;Rentz&quot; was sunk as a target during Exercise Valiant Shield 2016, and &quot;Vandegrift&quot; was sunk as a target during Exercise Valiant Shield 2022.
*: Two former U.S. Navy &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class ships were offered to the Ukrainian Navy in 2018 to increase its operational capacity in the Azov and Black seas after it was significantly reduced following the annexation of Crimea by Russia (a large part of Ukrainian navy vessels stationed there were seized).

===Former operators===
* (): The Royal Australian Navy purchased six frigates. Four of them were built in the United States, while the other two were built in Australia. Four of the ships were upgraded with the addition of an eight-cell Mk 41 VLS with 32 ESSMs, and the Standard Missile SM-2, plus upgraded radars and sonars, while the other two ships were decommissioned at that time. They have been replaced by the air-warfare destroyers, with the last Adelaide-class frigate retiring on 26 October 2019.
*: The U.S. Navy commissioned 51 FFG-7 class frigates between 1977 and 1989. The last of these, &quot;Simpson&quot;, was decommissioned on 29 September 2015.

The Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2013 authorized the transfer of and to Mexico, and the sale of , , , and to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States (which is the Taiwan agency designated under the Taiwan Relations Act) for about $10 million each.

==Considered for reactivation==
On 13 June 2017, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John M. Richardson said the Navy was looking into the possibility of recommissioning several &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigates from its inactive fleet to support President Donald Trump&#x27;s proposed 355-ship navy plan. On 11 December 2017, the Navy decided against reactivating the class, saying it would cost too much.

As of 8 September 2022, the decommissioned but extant &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigates, kept at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, were:

<text>The Ottawa Senators (), officially the Ottawa Senators Hockey Club and colloquially known as the Sens, are a professional ice hockey team based in Ottawa. The Senators compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at the 18,652-seat Canadian Tire Centre, which opened in 1996 as &quot;The Palladium&quot;.

Founded and established by Ottawa real estate developer Bruce Firestone, the team is the second NHL franchise to use the Ottawa Senators name. The original Ottawa Senators, founded in 1883, had a famed history, winning the Stanley Cup 11 times, playing in the NHL from 1917 until 1934. On December 6, 1990, after a two-year public campaign by Firestone, the NHL awarded a new franchise, which began play in the 1992–93 season. The Senators have made 16 playoff appearances, won four division titles, and won the 2003 Presidents&#x27; Trophy. They made an appearance in the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals but lost to the Anaheim Ducks in five games.

==History==
Ottawa had been home to the original Senators, a founding NHL franchise and 11-time Stanley Cup champions. After the NHL expanded to the United States in the late 1920s, the original Senators&#x27; eventual financial losses forced the franchise to move to St. Louis in 1934 operating as the Eagles while a Senators senior amateur team took over the Senators&#x27; place in Ottawa. The NHL team was unsuccessful in St. Louis and planned to return to Ottawa, but the NHL decided instead to suspend the franchise and transfer the players to other NHL teams.

Fifty-four years later, after the NHL announced plans to expand, Ottawa real estate developer Bruce Firestone decided along with colleagues Cyril Leeder and Randy Sexton that Ottawa was now able to support an NHL franchise, and the group proceeded to put a bid together. His firm, Terrace Investments, did not have the liquid assets to finance the expansion fee and the team, but the group conceived a strategy to leverage land development. In 1989, after finding a suitable site on farmland just west of Ottawa in Kanata on which to construct a new arena, Terrace announced its intention to win a franchise and launched a successful &quot;Bring Back the Senators&quot; campaign to both woo the public and persuade the NHL that the city could support an NHL franchise. Public support was high, and the group would secure over 11,000 season ticket pledges. On December 12, 1990, the NHL approved a new franchise for Firestone&#x27;s group to start play in the 1992–93 season.

===Early years (1992–1996)===
The new team hired former NHL player Mel Bridgman, who had no previous NHL management experience, as its first general manager in 1992. Ottawa signed former Boston head coach Rick Bowness. The new Senators were placed in the Adams Division of the Wales Conference and played their first game on October 8, 1992, in the Ottawa Civic Centre against the Montreal Canadiens with much pre-game spectacle. The Senators defeated the Canadiens 5–3 in one of the few highlights that season. Following the initial excitement of the opening night victory, the club floundered badly. Eventually, it tied the San Jose Sharks for the worst record in the league, winning only 10 games with 70 losses and four ties for 24 points, three points better than the NHL record for futility. The Senators had aimed low and considered the 1992–93 season a small success, as Firestone had set a goal for the season of not setting a new NHL record for fewest points in a season. The long-term plan was to finish low in the standings for its first few years to secure high draft picks and eventually contend for the Stanley Cup.
Terrace needed a partner to make the final franchise payment to the NHL. Firestone sold 50% of Terrace to Rod Bryden, a technology executive and entrepreneur. A limited partnership was set up to own the hockey team and a new company, Palladium Corp., which was charged with building the new arena. The partnership included local high-tech executives and singer Paul Anka, who was born in Ottawa. Bryden would become the sole owner of Terrace and majority owner of the Senators in August 1993, buying out Firestone.

Bridgman was fired after one season and team president Randy Sexton took over the general manager duties. The strategy of aiming low and securing a high draft position did not change. The Senators finished last overall for the next three seasons. For the 1993–94 season, the team now played in the Eastern Conference&#x27;s Northeast Division. Although 1993 first overall draft choice Alexandre Daigle wound up being one of the greatest draft busts in NHL history, they chose Radek Bonk in 1994, Bryan Berard (traded for Wade Redden) in 1995, Chris Phillips in 1996 and Marian Hossa in 1997, all of whom would become solid NHL players and formed a strong core of players in years to come. Alexei Yashin, the team&#x27;s first-ever draft selection from 1992, emerged as one of the NHL&#x27;s brightest young stars. The team traded many of their better veteran players of the era, including 1992–93 leading scorer Norm Maciver and fan favourites Mike Peluso and Bob Kudelski in an effort to stockpile prospects and draft picks.

As the 1995–96 season began, star centre Alexei Yashin refused to honour his contract and did not play. In December, after three straight last-place finishes and a team which was ridiculed throughout the league, fans began to grow restless waiting for the team&#x27;s long-term plan to yield results, and arena attendance began to decline. Rick Bowness was fired in late 1995 and was replaced by the Prince Edward Island Senators&#x27; head coach Dave Allison. Allison would fare no better than his predecessor, and the team would stumble to a 2–22–3 record under him. Sexton himself was fired and replaced by Pierre Gauthier, the former assistant general manager of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim team. Before the end of January 1996, Gauthier had resolved the team&#x27;s most pressing issues by settling star player Alexei Yashin&#x27;s contract dispute, and hiring the highly regarded Jacques Martin as head coach. While Ottawa finished last-overall once again, the season ended with renewed optimism, due in part to the upgraded management and coaching, and also to the emergence of an unheralded rookie from Sweden named Daniel Alfredsson, who would win the Calder Memorial Trophy as NHL Rookie of the Year in 1996.

===Jacques Martin era (1996–2004)===

Martin would impose a &quot;strong defence first&quot; philosophy that led to the team qualifying for the playoffs every season that he coached, but he was criticized for the team&#x27;s lack of success in the playoffs, notably losing four straight series against their provincial rival, the Toronto Maple Leafs.

In 1996–97, his first season, the club qualified for the playoffs in the last game of the season and nearly defeated the Buffalo Sabres in the first round. In 1997–98, the club finished with their first winning record and upset the heavily favoured New Jersey Devils to win their first playoff series. However, they were ousted in the second round by the Washington Capitals. In 1998–99, the Senators jumped from fourteenth overall in the previous season to third, with 103 points—the first 100-point season in club history, only to be swept in the first round by the Sabres. In 1999–2000, despite the holdout of team captain Alexei Yashin, Martin guided the team to the playoffs, only to lose to the Maple Leafs in the first Battle of Ontario series. Yashin returned for 2000–01 and the team improved to win their division and place second in the Eastern Conference. Yashin played poorly in another first-round playoff loss and on the day of the 2001 NHL entry draft, he was traded to the New York Islanders in exchange for Zdeno Chara, Bill Muckalt and the second overall selection in the draft, which Ottawa used to select centre Jason Spezza.

The 2001–02 Senators regular season points total dropped, but in the playoffs, they upset the Philadelphia Flyers for the franchise&#x27;s second playoff series win. The Sens would go on to push their second-round series to seven games, but they were ultimately once again defeated by the Maple Leafs. Despite speculation that Martin would be fired, it was general manager Marshall Johnston who left, retiring from the team. He was replaced by John Muckler, the Senators&#x27; first with previous management experience.

Although the Senators were bankrupt, they continued to play in the 2002–03 season after getting emergency financing. Despite the off-ice problems, Ottawa had an outstanding season, placing first overall in the NHL to win the Presidents&#x27; Trophy. In the playoffs, they came within one game of making it into the Stanley Cup Finals, losing to the eventual Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils. In 2003–04, Martin would guide the team to another good regular season but again would lose in the first round of the playoffs to the Maple Leafs, leading to Martin&#x27;s dismissal as management felt that a new coach was required for playoff success.

====Bankruptcy and sale to Eugene Melnyk====
In 2000, owner Bryden publicly appealed for tax relief from the Government of Canada for all Canadian NHL teams, coping with a significant drop in the Canadian dollar. His appeal was first met with a plan for tax relief, but the tax relief program was cancelled. Bryden then announced the sale of the club outright to a limited partnership in 2002 for  million, which would include creditors and Bryden himself. After its principal creditor Ogden Entertainment failed, the Senators entered bankruptcy protection in January 2003, owing  million for the club and  million for the arena. The deal fell through in 2003 when American investor Nelson Peltz declined to get involved.

In August 2003, pharmaceutical billionaire Eugene Melnyk purchased the club for a reported  million. Melnyk, principal shareholder of Biovail Pharmaceuticals, chose to finance half of the purchase price for the club and arena with debt. Share values of Biovail were depressed, and he did not want to sell them at the lower price.

===Bryan Murray era (2004–2016)===
After the playoff loss, owner Melnyk promised that changes were coming, and they came quickly. In June 2004, Anaheim Ducks general manager Bryan Murray of nearby Shawville became the head coach. That summer, the team also made substantial personnel changes, trading long-time players Patrick Lalime and Radek Bonk, and signing free agent goaltender Dominik Hasek. The team would not be able to show its new line-up for a year, as the 2004–05 NHL lock-out intervened and most players played in Europe or in the minors. In a final change, just before the 2005–06 season, the team traded long-time player Marian Hossa for Dany Heatley.
The media predicted the Senators to be Stanley Cup contenders in 2005–06, as they had a strong core of players returning. They played an up-tempo style that fit the new rule changes, and Hasek was expected to provide top-notch goaltending. The team rushed out of the gate, winning 19 of the first 22 games, in the end winning 52 games and 113 points, placing first in the conference, and second overall. The newly formed &#x27;CASH&#x27; line of Alfredsson, Spezza and newly acquired Dany Heatley established itself as one of the league&#x27;s top offensive lines. Hasek played well until he was injured during the 2006 Winter Olympics, forcing the team to enter the playoffs with rookie netminder Ray Emery as their starter. Without Hasek, the club bowed out in a second-round loss to the Buffalo Sabres.

In 2006–07, the Senators reached the Stanley Cup Finals after qualifying for the playoffs in nine consecutive seasons. The Senators had a high turn-over of personnel and the disappointment of 2006 to overcome and started the season poorly. Trade rumours swirled around Daniel Alfredsson for most of the last months of 2006. The team lifted itself out of last place in the division to nearly catch the Buffalo Sabres by season&#x27;s end, placing fourth in the Eastern Conference. The team finished with 105 points, their fourth consecutive 100-point season and sixth in the last eight. In the playoffs, Ottawa continued its good play. Led by the &#x27;CASH&#x27; line, goaltender Ray Emery, and the strong defence of Chris Phillips and Anton Volchenkov, the club defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins, the second-ranked New Jersey Devils and the top-ranked Sabres to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals.

The 2006–07 Senators thus became the first Ottawa team to be in a Stanley Cup Finals since 1927, and the city was swept up in the excitement. Businesses along all of the main streets posted large hand-drawn &quot;Go Sens Go&quot; signs, residents put up large displays in front of their homes or decorated their cars. A large Ottawa Senators flag was draped on the City Hall, along with a large video screen showing the games. A six-storey likeness of Daniel Alfredsson was hung on the Corel building. Rallies were held outside of City Hall, car rallies of decorated cars paraded through town and a section of downtown, dubbed the &quot;Sens Mile&quot;, was closed off to traffic during and after games for fans to congregate.

In the Stanley Cup Finals, the Senators faced the Anaheim Ducks, considered a favourite since the start of the season, a team the Senators had last played in 2006, and a team known for its strong defence. The Ducks won the first two games in Anaheim 3–2 and 1–0. Returning home, the Senators won game three 5–3 but lost game four 3–2. The Ducks won game five 6–2 in Anaheim to clinch the series and their first Stanley Cup championship. The Ducks had played outstanding defence, shutting down the &#x27;CASH&#x27; line, forcing Murray to split up the line. The Ducks scored timely goals and Ducks&#x27; goaltender Jean-Sebastien Giguere out-played Emery.

In the off-season after the Stanley Cup Finals, Bryan Murray&#x27;s contract was expiring. At the same time, general manager (GM) John Muckler had one season remaining and was expected to retire. Murray, who had previously been a general manager for other NHL clubs, was expected to take over the general manager position, although no public timetable was given. Owner Melnyk decided to offer Muckler another position in the organization and give the general manager position to Murray. Muckler declined the offer and was relieved from his position. Melnyk publicly justified the move, saying that he expected to lose Murray if his contract ran out. Murray then elevated John Paddock, the assistant coach, to head coach of the Senators. Under Paddock, the team came out to a record start to the 2007–08 season. However, team play declined to a .500 level, and the team was falling out of the playoffs. Paddock was fired by Murray, who took over coaching on an interim basis. The club managed to qualify for the playoffs by a tie-breaker but was swept in the first round of the playoffs by the Pittsburgh Penguins. In June, the club bought out goaltender Ray Emery, who had become notorious for off-ice events in Ottawa and lateness to several team practices.
For 2008–09, Murray hired Craig Hartsburg to coach the Senators. Under Hartsburg&#x27;s style, the Senators struggled and played under .500. Uneven goaltending with Martin Gerber and Alex Auld meant the team played cautiously to protect the goaltender. Murray&#x27;s patience ran out in February 2009, with the team well out of playoff contention, and Hartsburg was fired, although he had two years left on his contract, and the team also had Paddock under contract. Cory Clouston was elevated from the Binghamton coaching position. The team played above .500 under Clouston and rookie goaltender Brian Elliott, who had been promoted from Binghamton. Gerber was waived from the team at the trading deadline, and the team traded for goaltender Pascal Leclaire, although he would not play due to injury. The team failed to make the playoffs for the first time in 12 seasons. Auld would be traded in the off-season to make room. Clouston&#x27;s coaching had caused a rift with top player Dany Heatley (although unspecified &quot;personal issues&quot; were also noted by Heatley), and after Clouston was given a contract to continue coaching, Heatley made a trade demand and was traded to the San Jose Sharks just before the start of the 2009–10 season.

In 2009–10, the Senators were a .500 team until going on a team-record 11-game winning streak in January. The streak propelled the team to the top of the Northeast Division standings and a top-three placing for the playoffs. The team could not hold off the Sabres for the division lead but qualified for the playoffs in the fifth position. For the third season in four, the Senators played off against the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round. A highlight for the Senators was winning a triple-overtime fifth game in Pittsburgh, but the team could not win a playoff game on home ice, losing the series in six games.

The Senators had a much poorer than expected 2010–11 campaign, resulting in constant rumours of a shakeup right through until December. The rumours were heightened in January after the team went on a lengthy losing streak. January was a dismal month for the Senators, winning only one game. Media speculated on the imminent firing of Clouston, Murray or both. Owner Melynk cleared the air in an article in the January 22, 2011 edition of the &quot;Ottawa Sun.&quot; Melnyk stated that he would not fire either Clouston or Murray but that he had given up on this season and was in the process of developing a plan for the future. On Monday, January 24, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported that the plan included hiring a new general manager before the June entry draft and that Murray would be retained as an advisor to the team. A decision on whether to retain Clouston would be made by the new general manager. The article by Roy MacGregor, a long-time reporter of the Ottawa Senators, stated that former assistant coach Pierre McGuire had already been interviewed. Murray, in a press conference that day, stated that he wished to stay on as the team&#x27;s general manager. He also stated that Melnyk was allowing him to continue as the general manager without restraint. Murray said that the players were now to be judged by their play until the February 28 trade deadline. Murray would attempt to move &quot;a couple, at least,&quot; of the players for draft picks or prospects at that time if the Senators remained out of playoff contention.
True to his word, Murray made a flurry of trades. He started his overhaul with the trading of Mike Fisher to the Nashville Predators. Fisher already had a home in Nashville with his wife Carrie Underwood. The trading of Fisher, a fan favourite in Ottawa, led to a small anti-Underwood backlash with the banning of her songs from the playlists of some local radio stations. Murray next traded veterans Chris Kelly, and Jarkko Ruutu. A swap of goaltenders was made with the Colorado Avalanche which brought Craig Anderson to Ottawa in exchange for Brian Elliott, both goaltenders having sub-par years. Next, under-achieving forward Alex Kovalev was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins. On trade deadline day, Ottawa picked up goaltender Curtis McElhinney on waivers. It traded Chris Campoli with a seventh-round pick to the Chicago Blackhawks for a second-round pick and Ryan Potulny. Goaltender Anderson played very well down the stretch for Ottawa, and the team quickly signed the soon-to-be unrestricted free agent to a four-year contract. After media speculation on the future of Murray within the organization, Murray was re-signed as general manager on April 8 to a three-year extension. On April 9, head coach Cory Clouston and assistants Greg Carvel and Brad Lauer were dismissed from their positions. Murray said that the decision was made based on the fact that the team entered the season believing it was a contender, but finished with a 32–40–10 record. Former Detroit Red Wings&#x27; assistant coach Paul MacLean was hired as Clouston&#x27;s replacement on June 14, 2011.

As the 2011–12 season began, many hockey writers and commentators were convinced that the Senators would finish at or near the bottom of the NHL standings. While rebuilding, the Ottawa line-up contained many rookies and inexperienced players. The team struggled out of the gate, losing five of their first six games before a reversal of fortunes saw them win six games in a row. In December 2011, the team acquired forward Kyle Turris from the Phoenix Coyotes in exchange for highly regarded prospect David Rundblad and a draft pick. The team improved its play afterwards and moved into a playoff position before the All-Star Game. For the first time in Senators&#x27; history, the All-Star Game was held in Ottawa and considered a great success. Five Senators were voted in or named to the event, including Daniel Alfredsson, who was named the captain of one team. The team continued its playoff push after the break. After starting goaltender Craig Anderson injured his hand in a kitchen accident at home, the Senators called up Robin Lehner from Binghamton and acquired highly regarded goaltender Ben Bishop from the St. Louis Blues. While Anderson recovered, the team continued its solid play and finished as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference, drawing a first-round playoff matchup against the Conference champion New York Rangers. Ultimately, Ottawa lost the series in seven games.
The next season, Ottawa would be challenged to repeat the success they had in 2011–12 due to long-term injuries to key players such as Erik Karlsson, Jason Spezza, Milan Michalek and Craig Anderson. Despite these injuries, the Senators would finish seventh in the Eastern Conference and head coach Paul MacLean would go on to win the Jack Adams Award as the NHL&#x27;s coach of the year. In a rivalry series, Ottawa defeated the second-seeded Montreal Canadiens in the first round of the playoffs in five games, blowing out Montreal 6–1 in games three and five. This was the first Montreal-Ottawa playoff series since Ottawa joined the league and the first between the cities&#x27; teams since the original Senators played the Canadiens in 1927. The Senators could not repeat the upset, losing to the top-seeded Pittsburgh Penguins in five games in the second round.

July 5, 2013, would be a day of mixed emotions for the city and fans, as long-time captain Daniel Alfredsson signed a one-year contract with the Detroit Red Wings, leaving Ottawa after 17 seasons with the Senators and 14 as captain after a contract dispute. The signing shocked numerous fans across the city and many within the Senators organization. The day finished optimistically, however, as Murray acquired star forward Bobby Ryan from the Anaheim Ducks, hoping Ryan could replace Alfredsson on the top line with Jason Spezza. Murray would also sign free-agent forward Clarke MacArthur to a two-year contract that same day and bring back former defenceman Joe Corvo to a one-year contract three days later on July 8, 2013.

For the 2013–14 season, the league realigned and Ottawa was assigned to the new Atlantic Division along with the rest of the old Northeast Division and the Detroit Red Wings, formerly of the Western Conference. The re-alignment brought increased competition to qualify for the playoffs, as there were now 16 teams in the Eastern Conference fighting for eight playoff spots. The season began with a changing of leadership, as on September 14, 2013, the Ottawa Senators named Jason Spezza their eighth captain in franchise history. While new addition Clarke MacArthur had a career year, Ryan and Spezza struggled to find chemistry, and Ryan was moved to a line with MacArthur and Kyle Turris. Corvo lost his place in the line-up and was waived. The team outside of a playoff position, Murray bolstered the club with a trade for flashy right-winger Ales Hemsky from the Edmonton Oilers. The club, however, was eliminated from playoff contention in the last week of the season, finishing five points short. Further disappointment ensued as the team lost Hemsky to free agency and Spezza requested a trade out of Ottawa, ending the era of the stars of the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals team. Spezza agreed to be traded to the Dallas Stars and was sent with Ludwig Karlsson for Alex Chiasson, Nick Paul, Alex Guptill and a 2015 second-round pick.
At the beginning of the 2014–15 season, Karlsson was named the franchise&#x27;s ninth captain and the club signed Ryan to a seven-year extension. Unhappy with an 11–11–5 record after 27 games, the Senators fired head coach Paul MacLean and replaced him with assistant coach Dave Cameron. The change turned the season around for the Senators, who won 32 of their last 55 games. After both Senators&#x27; goalies Anderson and Lehner were injured, the team turned to Binghamton goaltender Andrew Hammond. Hammond, aka &#x27;The Hamburglar,&#x27; would compile a record of 20–1–2, a goals-against average of 1.79, and a save percentage of .941 to get the team back into playoff position. The Senators became the first team in modern NHL history to overcome a 14-point deficit at any juncture of the season to qualify for the playoffs. However, the Senators lost to the Canadiens in six games in the first round of the playoffs.

During the 2014–15 season, it was announced that Murray had cancer. Taking regular treatment, Murray chose to stay on as general manager through the 2015–16 season. Despite posting the best record of any Canadian team in the league, the Senators failed to make the playoffs in what was considered a disappointing season (all seven Canadian teams missed the playoffs). Murray made one &#x27;blockbuster&#x27; nine-player trade that brought Toronto Maple Leafs&#x27; captain Dion Phaneuf to the Senators before the trade deadline. The Senators were outside of a playoff position at the time of the deal, and played well until the end of the season, but fell just short, placing fifth in the division.

===Pierre Dorion era (2016–2023)===
On April 10, 2016, the day after the final game of the 2015–16 season, Murray announced his resignation as general manager and that he would continue in an advisory role with the club. Assistant general manager Pierre Dorion was promoted to the general manager position. On April 12, 2016, the Senators fired head coach Dave Cameron. On May 8, 2016, the Senators hired former Tampa Bay Lightning head coach Guy Boucher as their new head coach. On the following day, Marc Crawford was announced as associate coach. On June 13, 2016, the Senators hired Daniel Alfredsson as the senior advisor of hockey operations. In June 2016, the Senators hired Rob Cookson as an assistant coach, who had worked with both Boucher and Crawford in Switzerland, and Pierre Groulx as a goaltending coach.

The Senators finished second in the Atlantic Division during the 2016–17 season. They faced the Boston Bruins in the first round of the playoffs, winning that series in six games. In the second round, they defeated the New York Rangers in six games. During the second game of that series, Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored four goals, including the game-winning goal in double overtime. The Senators would come within one win of the Stanley Cup Finals having lost in double overtime of the seventh game of their conference finals series against the Pittsburgh Penguins, who went on to win their second consecutive Stanley Cup.

Following their appearance in the conference finals the previous season, the Senators lost defenceman Marc Methot to the 2017 NHL expansion draft. On November 5, 2017, the Senators conducted a blockbuster trade with the Colorado Avalanche, bringing in star forward Matt Duchene from the Avalanche in exchange for Kyle Turris, Shane Bowers, Andrew Hammond, a conditional first-round pick in 2018 or 2019 and a third-round pick in 2019. Following the trade, however, the Senators&#x27; season began to fall apart with a disastrous November road trip. A season highlight was hosting the NHL 100 Classic game outdoors at the TD Place Stadium football field versus the Montreal Canadiens. The game marked the centennial of the first Montreal-Ottawa game in the NHL. The Senators won the game 3–0, but the festival atmosphere was somewhat marred by owner Melnyk&#x27;s controversial comments to the press about attendance levels and selling or moving the team. Out of the playoff picture, the Senators chose to trade away veteran players. Forward Derick Brassard and defenceman Dion Phaneuf were dealt at the trade deadline to the Pittsburgh Penguins and Los Angeles Kings, respectively. The Senators finished the year second-to-last in the league with a 28–43–11 record and 67 points, their fourth-worst season since entering the league.

During the 2018 off-season, the Senators began what would end up being a complete rebuild. They traded forward Mike Hoffman to the San Jose Sharks, who later that day flipped him to the Florida Panthers. The Senators ended up with the fourth-overall pick in the 2018 draft due to their poor record. Under the Matt Duchene trade conditions, they either had to give up the pick to the Avalanche or wait a year and surrender their 2019 first-round pick instead. The Senators elected to keep the pick and selected forward Brady Tkachuk fourth overall. Just before the regular season started, the Senators traded their captain, Erik Karlsson, to the San Jose Sharks for a large package of players and draft picks.

After a miserable start to the 2018–19 season, the Senators were unable to re-sign forwards Matt Duchene, Mark Stone and Ryan Dzingel before the trade deadline. In an attempt to create optimism, owner Melnyk famously stated: &quot;The Senators will be all-in again for a five-year run of unparalleled success–where the team will plan to spend close to the NHL&#x27;s salary cap every year from 2021 to 2025. The Senators&#x27; current rebuild is a blueprint on how to bring the Stanley Cup home to its rightful place in Ottawa.&quot; All three players were subsequently traded before the 2019 trade deadline. Duchene and Dzingel were traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for draft picks, prospects and Anthony Duclair. In contrast, fan favourite Mark Stone was traded to the Vegas Golden Knights in exchange for prospect Erik Brannstrom, forward Oscar Lindberg and a second-round pick. Just days after trading away the team&#x27;s three leading scorers, it was announced that the plans for a new downtown arena on the open land at Lebreton Flats had fallen through. The Ottawa Citizen called it &quot;one of the gloomiest weeks in the history of the Ottawa Senators.&quot; On March 1, 2019, with the team in 31st place, head coach Guy Boucher was fired with associate coach Marc Crawford taking over as head coach for the remainder of the season. The 2018–19 season saw the team finish last in the NHL without their own first-round draft pick. This marked the first time since 1995–96 that the Senators missed back-to-back playoff appearances.

Prior to the 2019–20 season, D. J. Smith was hired as the new head coach while the organization shifted its focus to developing its young players. The season was ultimately cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Senators finished second last in the NHL with 62 points in 71 games. In contrast, Ottawa&#x27;s farm team, the Belleville Senators, put together a very impressive, albeit shortened season led by Ottawa&#x27;s top prospects, which included Josh Norris, Drake Batherson, Alex Formenton and Erik Brannstrom among others. Meanwhile, the San Jose Sharks suffered an unexpected collapse that year which significantly benefited the Senators who had acquired their first-round draft pick in the Erik Karlsson trade. Ottawa found themselves with the third and fifth picks in the 2020 NHL draft and used them to select highly touted prospects Tim Stuetzle and Jake Sanderson.

The Senators would miss the playoffs again for the 2020–21 season, a season overshadowed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The young team played an all-Canadian shortened season, during which they had a poor record to start the season but finished the season with a strong stretch of play, inspiring some optimism for the future. The Senators again traded away veterans at the trade deadline for draft picks.

Before the 2021–22 season, general manager Pierre Dorion&#x27;s contract was extended until 2025. He proceeded to declare: &quot;The rebuild is done. Now we&#x27;re stepping into another zone.&quot; His claims, however, did not materialize as the Senators got off to a slow start and were quickly out of the playoff picture. On October 17, 2021, Brady Tkachuk signed a seven-year deal after a dramatic contract holdout. Just under three weeks later, he was named the 10th captain in franchise history at just 22 years of age. Tkachuk was, at the time, the franchise&#x27;s youngest-ever captain.

Ahead of the 2022–23 season, the team was aggressive in their efforts to exit their rebuild, drastically retooling the team through the acquisitions of forwards Alex DeBrincat and Claude Giroux and goaltender Cam Talbot. In addition, the team signed Josh Norris and Tim Stuetzle to eight-year contract extensions. At the end of the season, the Senators missed the playoffs by six points.

Before the 2023–24 season, DeBrincat notified the Senators he would not re-sign long-term with the club and was traded to Detroit. Talbot was not re-signed. Instead, the Senators signed free agents – goaltender Joonas Korpisalo and forward Vladimir Tarasenko. At the start of the 2023–24 season, the NHL levied the forfeiture of a first-round pick due to negligence on the part of the Senators involving the trade of Evgeni Dadonov. Dorion resigned as general manager upon being asked to step down by owner Michael Andlauer. After an 11–15–0 start to the season, the Senators fired D.J. Smith on December 18, 2023 and former head coach Jacques Martin, who had been serving as a senior advisor stepped in as interim coach until the end of the season.

===Death of owner Eugene Melnyk and sale===
Owner Eugene Melnyk died in March 2022 due to an unspecified illness. In statements in recent years, Melnyk had said that he planned to leave the team to his two daughters Olivia and Anna when he had been asked if he intended to sell the team. However, there had been speculation about ownership changes. The team added an &#x27;EM&#x27; patch on the jersey for the rest of the season. In November 2022, the team engaged a New York City investment banker to facilitate a sale of the team. The Senators confirmed the planned sale in a press release on November 5, with a condition of sale being that the team remain in Ottawa. On June 13, 2023, the Senators announced that a purchase agreement had been signed with a group of investors headed by Michael Andlauer, a Toronto businessman and part-owner of the Montreal Canadiens. Andlauer became majority owner along with his partners, Eugene Melnyk&#x27;s daughters, and a group of Canadian businessmen on September 21, 2023.

==Rivalries==

===Toronto Maple Leafs===

The Battle of Ontario is a rivalry with the Toronto Maple Leafs. It is the current version of an old rivalry between Ottawa, Canada&#x27;s capital, and Toronto, Canada&#x27;s largest city and business capital. The teams compete in the same division and meet frequently during regular season games. In the early 2000s, the teams met four consecutive times in the playoffs with Toronto winning all four series.

As of the end of the 2023–24 season, Ottawa leads the regular season series 73–55–3–13, while Toronto leads 16–8 in the playoff record.

===Montreal Canadiens===
There is a long-standing Ottawa-Montreal rivalry (dating back to the 1800s) in multiple sports including ice hockey. Today, both teams compete in the Atlantic Division. There is only a two-hour drive from Montreal to Ottawa via Quebec Autoroute 40 and Ontario Highway 417, plus railway and air connections. When the teams play in Ottawa, &quot;the games matter&quot; according to sports writer Wayne Scanlan of the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;, and many Canadiens fans turn out in Montreal jerseys. The current rivalry began when the Ottawa Senators&#x27; first NHL game was held in Ottawa on October 8, 1992, where the expansion Senators beat the Montreal Canadiens 5–3. That victory was one of the only Senators&#x27; highlights of their inaugural season; they won only nine more games the rest of the season to finish with 10 wins and 24 points, while the Canadiens won their 24th Stanley Cup that season. Another regular season highlight of the Canadiens–Ottawa rivalry was the NHL 100 Classic played at TD Place Stadium outdoors in Ottawa in December 2017, celebrating the centennial of the first NHL game between the original Senators and the Canadiens.

The rivalry existed prior to the teams meeting in the playoffs, especially as the teams both became competitive in the early 2000s and Ottawa&#x27;s captain Daniel Alfredsson was among those who hoped for a playoff series between the two. The hoped-for playoff series finally came in 2013. In that series, there were a large number of controversial events. In game one, Ottawa&#x27;s Eric Gryba laid out Montreal&#x27;s Lars Eller in an open ice hit. After the game, the Senators&#x27; head coach Paul MacLean blamed Raphael Diaz for a suicide pass. Later, Canadiens&#x27; coach Michel Therrien responded and said that what MacLean said was a &quot;lack of respect.&quot; Ottawa won that game 4–2. Brandon Prust later insulted MacLean after the game, saying that he doesn&#x27;t care what that &quot;bug-eyed, fat walrus has to say.&quot; In game three, there was a full line brawl between Ottawa and Montreal. And later in that game, Paul MacLean called a timeout with 17 seconds left in the third period with a 6–1 lead. Michel Therrien called Maclean classless while Maclean responded by saying that he was protecting his players from Montreal&#x27;s dirty play in that game. The Senators eventually won the series 4–1.

Two years later, the rivalry was renewed in another playoff series. In game one, Montreal&#x27;s P. K. Subban slashed Ottawa&#x27;s Mark Stone – breaking his wrist – and Subban was later ejected. Senators&#x27; coach Dave Cameron called the slash vicious and said that Subban deserved a suspension. Ottawa&#x27;s Clarke MacArthur called it a lumberjack slash, and Mark Stone said that he was being targeted all game. Meanwhile, Michel Therrien said that Subban did not deserve to be ejected and should have only gotten a minor penalty. The Canadiens won that game 4–3. The Canadiens won the next to games in overtime. Riding a 3–0 lead in the series, the Canadiens saw Ottawa win the next two games, before closing the series in game six with a 2–0 victory in Ottawa.

As of the end of the 2023–24 season, Montreal leads the current Ottawa Senators in the regular season series 81–65–5–16, while Ottawa leads 6–5 in the playoff record.

=== Buffalo Sabres (1992–2008) ===
The Sabres and Senators had a strong rivalry after the 2004–05 NHL lockout, when both teams were vying for the Northeast Division title. Ottawa had the upper hand on Buffalo during regular season games, but Buffalo beat them in the playoffs. The best known game in this rivalry occurred on February 22, 2007, which included a large fight that included both goaltenders and verbal sparring between the two coaches (Buffalo won the game 6–5).

The teams have met four times in the playoffs in 1997, 1999, 2006 and 2007, with Buffalo winning three series and Ottawa winning one. Ottawa also beat Buffalo in the final game of the 1996–97 season to make the playoffs for the first time since entering the league. With both teams struggling at inconsistent times, the rivalry effectively ended; however, both teams remain in the same division, and the rivalry could be renewed if another incident were to occur.

As of the end of the 2023–24 season, Buffalo leads the regular season record 75–61–10–10 with a 13–8 playoff record.

==Home rinks==

===Ottawa Civic Centre===

The Senators&#x27; first home arena was the Ottawa Civic Centre (now TD Place Arena), located on Bank Street in Ottawa, where they played from the 1992–93 season to January of the 1995–96 season. The arena, used by the junior Ottawa 67&#x27;s, was renovated for the Senators, including adding press boxes and luxury boxes. They played their first home game on October 8, 1992, against the Montreal Canadiens with much pre-game spectacle. The Senators would defeat the Canadiens 5–3. Their last game in the arena was on December 31, 1995, versus the Tampa Bay Lightning.

===Canadian Tire Centre===

As part of its bid to land an NHL franchise for Ottawa, Terrace Corporation unveiled the original proposal for the arena development at a press conference in September 1989. The proposal included a hotel and 20,500-seat arena, named The Palladium, on , surrounded by a mini-city, named &quot;West Terrace.&quot; The site itself, of farmland, on the western border of Kanata, had been acquired in May 1987 from farmer Cyril Bennett for  million, and flipped to Terrace for  million in 1989. Rezoning approval was granted by the Ontario Municipal Board on August 28, 1991, with conditions. The conditions imposed by the board included scaling down the arena to 18,500 seats, a moratorium on development outside the initial arena site, and that the cost of the highway interchange with Highway 417 be paid by Terrace. A two-year period was spent seeking financing for the site and interchange by Terrace Corporation. The corporation received a  million grant from the Government of Canada but needed to borrow to pay for the rest of the costs of construction. A ground-breaking ceremony was held in June 1992, but construction did not start until July 7, 1994. Actual construction took 18 months, finishing in January 1996.
The Palladium opened on January 15, 1996, with a concert by Canadian rocker Bryan Adams. The Senators played their first game in their new arena two days later, falling 3–0 to the Montreal Canadiens. On February 17, 1996, the name &#x27;Palladium&#x27; was changed to &#x27;Corel Centre&#x27; when Corel Corporation, an Ottawa software company, signed a twenty-year deal for the naming rights.

When mortgage holder Covanta Energy (the former Ogden Entertainment) went into receivership in 2001, Terrace was expected to pay off its debt to Covanta in full. The ownership could not refinance the arena, eventually leading Terrace itself to declare bankruptcy in 2002. On August 26, 2003, billionaire businessman Eugene Melnyk finalized the purchase of the Senators and the arena. The arena and club became solely owned by Melnyk through a new company, Capital Sports &amp; Entertainment.

In 2004, the ownership applied to expand its seating, and the City of Ottawa amended its by-laws for the venue, increasing its seating capacity in 2005 to 19,153 and total attendance capacity to 20,500, including standing room.

On January 19, 2006, the arena became known as &#x27;Scotiabank Place&#x27; after Melnyk reached a new 15-year naming agreement with Canadian bank Scotiabank on January 11, 2006, ending the 20-year contract with Corel. Scotiabank had been an advertising partner with the club for several years and a financial partner with owner Melnyk, and signed a million over 15-years deal; a slight increase over Corel&#x27;s contract. While Corel was no longer the arena name sponsor, it continued as an advertising sponsor.

In 2011, in time for the Senators hosting the NHL All-Star Game, the team installed a new video scoreboard, known as the &#x27;Bell HD&#x27; screen, made by Panasonic. The new scoreboard increased the video display from to and added LED rings.

On June 18, 2013, the Senators and Scotiabank ended the seven-year naming rights deal. The Ottawa Senators announced a marketing agreement with the Canadian Tire retail store chain, and as a result, the arena was renamed Canadian Tire Centre on July 1, 2013.

===Downtown arena proposal===

In 2015, the National Capital Commission (NCC) put out a request for proposals to redevelop the LeBreton Flats area in downtown Ottawa, a longtime vacant former industrial area. In 2016, the NCC settled on the proposal presented by Senators owner Eugene Melnyk and the RendezVous LeBreton Group partnership with Trinity Developments. The proposal included housing units, park space, a recreation facility, a library and a new arena for the Ottawa Senators.

The plan to build a new arena downtown came apart in late 2018 after it was revealed that the Senators were suing Trinity for  million in damages. Trinity was developing a site adjacent to the LeBreton Flats site, and the Senators felt this was inappropriate competition. Trinity responded with a  billion lawsuit, accusing the Senators of being unwilling to contribute any money to the project. The NCC announced the cancellation of the partnership&#x27;s bid to develop the site but gave the sides an extension when the two parties agreed to mediation. On February 27, 2019, it was announced that mediation between the parties had failed to come to an agreement and that the NCC would explore other options for the site&#x27;s redevelopment.

The NCC resumed the process to redevelop the overall site, reserving the site of the arena and asking for preliminary bids on the arena site separately. After a February 2022 deadline to submit bids, the NCC announced that it had received several bids for the site. Local media speculated that the Senators were actively pursuing a bid, authorized by Melnyk shortly before his death. On June 23, 2022, the NCC announced that the Senators proposal had been chosen for the site, with a lease agreement expected to be put in place by autumn of 2023. In related business, the outstanding lawsuits around the previous LeBreton bid were settled out of court in December 2022.

===Practice facility===
The Senators practice facility is known as the Bell Sensplex, a  million joint venture with the City of Ottawa. Located southeast of the Canadian Tire Centre, the facility has three NHL-sized rinks, an Olympics-size rink and a fieldhouse that opened in 2004. It is used for Senators&#x27; practices, minor hockey and it is also the home of the annual minor hockey league Bell Capital Cup tournament.

==Team identity==
The Senators organization is located in a bilingual marketplace and operates in both English and French. The City of Ottawa provides services in English and French and the Ottawa–Gatineau census metropolitan area contains a mix of anglophones and francophones. Longstanding Senators policy calls for providing services and marketing in both English and French to its bilingual fanbase. A bilingual version of the Canadian anthem is sung before home games, and all announcements are in both languages. It has been estimated that 40 percent of season ticket holders are francophone. Senators games are broadcast on both the English-language TSN and the French-language RDS networks, in a long-standing agreement with Bell Media.

===Logo and jersey design===
The team colours are black, red and white with gold trim. Except for the gold, the colours match the colours of the original Senators. The team&#x27;s home jersey is black with red trim, while the away jersey is white with black and red trim. The club&#x27;s logo is the head of a Roman general, a member of the Senate of the Roman Republic in a gold semi-circle. The original logo, unveiled on May 23, 1991, described the general as a &quot;centurion figure, strong and prominent&quot; according to its designer, Tony Milchard.

From 1992 to 1995, the Senators&#x27; primary road jerseys were black with red stripes. The numbers were red for the first season but switched to white afterward. White stripes were added to the uniform in 1995. The white uniforms, worn on home games until 2003 and on road games until 2007, featured black sleeves, tail stripes with red accents, and black lettering. In 1997, the Senators unveiled a red third jersey. It featured the first iteration of the &quot;forward-facing&quot; centurion logo, designed by Kevin Caradonna, head of the team&#x27;s graphic design department, who also designed the mascot &quot;Spartacat.&quot; The jersey became the team&#x27;s primary dark jersey starting in 1999. From 2000 to 2007, the Senators also wore a black alternate jersey with gold, red and white accents.
A new jersey design was unveiled on August 22, 2007, in conjunction with the league-wide adoption of the &quot;Rbk EDGE&quot; jerseys by Reebok for the 2007–08 season. The jersey incorporates the original Senators&#x27; &#x27;O&#x27; logo as a shoulder patch. At the same time, the team updated its logos and switched its usage. The primary logo, which, according to team owner Eugene Melnyk, &quot;represents strength and determination&quot; is an update of the old secondary logo.

Before the 2008–09 season, the Senators unveiled a new black third jersey featuring the shortened &quot;SENS&quot; moniker in front. The centurion logo adorns the shoulders, and the striping was inspired by the team&#x27;s original black jerseys.

In 2011, the Senators introduced a throwback-inspired third jersey design. Predominantly black, the jersey incorporated horizontal striping intended to be reminiscent of the original Senators&#x27; &#x27;barber-pole&#x27; designs. Shield-type patches were added to the shoulders. The design of the shield-type patches was meant to be similar to the shield patches that the original Senators added to their jerseys after each Stanley Cup championship win. The patches spell the team name, one in English and one in French. The design was a collaborative effort between the Senators and a fan in Gatineau, Quebec, who had been circulating a version of it on the internet since 2009. The black third jerseys served as the basis of the Senators&#x27; 2014 Heritage Classic jerseys, which used cream as the base colour.

In 2017, the Senators&#x27; jerseys received a slight makeover when Adidas replaced Reebok as the NHL&#x27;s uniform provider. The number font was changed to match those of their recent third jerseys, which were retired after the 2016–17 season. Before the 2018–19 season, the Senators brought back the red jerseys worn during the NHL 100 Classic as a third jersey. The design featured a silver &quot;O&quot; in front with black trim amid horizontal black, silver and white stripes.

In 2020, the Senators reintroduced its 1997–2007 logo with the jersey set used from 1992 to 1995. The updated logo uses a gold outline as opposed to red. The new uniforms, while largely resembling the originals from the 1990s, retained the lettering font used since the Adidas takeover. In contrast, the white uniforms retained only the black and red stripes along the upper arm sleeves. Both the home and away uniforms include a red band across the very bottom of the jerseys. In addition, the Senators unveiled a &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; alternate uniform; the design was of the original 1992–93 uniform but with red as the base colour. In the 2022–23 season, the Senators wore &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; uniforms based on the alternates they wore from 1997 to 2007, but with the current 2-D logo in front, black as the base colour and less white elements.

===Arena entertainment===

At many home games, the fans are entertained both outside and inside the Canadian Tire Centre with myriad entertainers – live music, DJs, giveaways and promotions. The live music includes the traditional Scottish music of the &#x27;Sons of Scotland Pipe Band&#x27; of Ottawa, along with highland dancers. Before and during games, entertainment is hosted by Spartacat, the official mascot of the Senators, an anthropomorphic lion. He made his debut on the Senators&#x27; opening night: October 8, 1992. During intermissions, the entertainment varies with on-ice contests, youth games, t-shirt giveaways, live bands and DJs. At each game, a selected fan rides one of the on-ice resurfacers (&quot;Zambonis&quot;). The team&#x27;s public address announcer is Jonathan Trottier and the in-game DJ is Alex Marchand. After each Senators&#x27; goal, the team&#x27;s DJ sounds the goal horn, which is a Nathan Airchime M3H from a retired Via Rail train. The team initially used it in the Ottawa Civic Centre. At each game, the Senators spotlight a Canadian veteran soldier.
Like other NHL arenas in Canada, &quot;O Canada&quot; is sung before the opening faceoff, along with &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; if an American team is visiting. &quot;O Canada&quot; is sung in both English and French with the first half of the first stanza and chorus sung in English and the second half of the first stanza sung in French. From 1994 until 2016, the national anthems were sung by former Ontario Provincial Police Constable Lyndon Slewidge. Currently, the team has no regular singer, alternating with various singers. During &quot;O Canada&quot;, a large Canadian flag is unfurled and passed from fan to fan in the lower bowl section.

The Senators have their own theme song titled &quot;Trumpeters Cry,&quot; which is played as the team comes on the ice and is also used in Sens TV web videos. The song was written by Ottawa singer-songwriter Andres del Castillo, who was formerly of the band Eight Seconds. The song is available in MP3 format at the nhl.com website. A 10-hour version is available on YouTube.

===Attendance, revenue and ownership===
On April 18, 2008, the club announced its final attendance figures for 2007–08. The club had 40 sell-outs out of 41 home dates, a total attendance of 812,665 during the regular season, placing the club third in attendance in the NHL. The number of sell-outs and the total attendance were both club records. The previous attendance records were set during the 2005–06 with a season total of 798,453 and 33 sell-outs. In the 2006–07 regular season, total attendance was 794,271, with 31 sell-outs out of 41 home dates or an average attendance of 19,372. In the 2007 playoffs, the Senators played nine games with nine sell-outs and an attendance of 181,272 for an average of 20,141, the highest in team history. Until recent seasons, the club was regularly represented in the top half in attendance in the NHL. In 2018–19, the Senators average attendance was 14,553, 27th in the league. Attendance dropped further in the 2019–20 season, dropping to an average of 12,618, the lowest in the league.

In 2022, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine valued the Senators at  million. &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated the debt/value ratio at 25% and that the team earned million in 2020–21 on revenue of  million. The team is now owned by Michael Andlauer who is the majority owner along with his partners, Eugene Melnyk&#x27;s daughters, and a group of Canadian businessmen. It was previously owned by Eugene Melynk who bought the team and arena out of bankruptcy in 2003 for  million. Before Melnyk&#x27;s ownership, the Senators were owned by founder Terrace Investments, majority owned by Rod Bryden, until it declared bankruptcy in 2002. Terrace Investments initially won the bid for an NHL franchise in 1990.

===Sens Army===

The fans of the Senators are known as the &quot;Sens Army&quot;. Like most hockey fanatics, they are known to dress up for games; some in Roman legionary clothing. For the 2006–07 playoff run, more fans than ever before would wear red. Fan activities included &#x27;Red Rallies&#x27; of decorated cars, fan rallies at Ottawa City Hall Plaza and the &#x27;Sens Mile&#x27; along Elgin Street, where fans would congregate.

====Sens Mile====
Much like the Red Mile in Calgary during the Flames&#x27; 2004 Stanley Cup run and the Copper Kilometre in Edmonton during the Oilers&#x27; 2006 Stanley Cup run, Senators&#x27; fans took to the streets to celebrate their team&#x27;s success during the 2007 playoffs. The idea to have a &#x27;Sens Mile&#x27; on downtown Elgin Street, a street with numerous restaurants and pubs, began as a grassroots campaign on Facebook by Ottawa residents before game four of the Ottawa–Buffalo conference finals series. After the game five win, Ottawa residents closed the street to traffic for a spontaneous celebration. The City of Ottawa then closed Elgin Street for each game of the Stanley Cup Finals.

==Broadcasting==
Ottawa Senators games are broadcast locally in both the English and French languages. As of the 2014–15 season, regional television rights to the Senators&#x27; regular season games not broadcast nationally by Sportsnet, TVA Sports, or &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; are owned by Bell Media under a 12-year contract, with games airing in English on TSN5, and in French on RDS. Regional broadcasts are available within the team&#x27;s designated region (shared with the Montreal Canadiens), which includes the Ottawa River valley, Eastern Ontario (portions are shared with the Toronto Maple Leafs), along with Quebec, the Maritime provinces and Newfoundland and Labrador.
On radio, all home and away games are broadcast on a five-station network stretching across Eastern Ontario, including one American station, WQTK in Ogdensburg, New York. The flagship radio station is CFGO in Ottawa. Radio broadcasts on CFGO began in 1997–98; the contract has since been extended through the 2025–2026 as part of Bell Media&#x27;s rights deal with the team. The Senators are broadcast on radio in French through Intersport Production and CJFO-FM in Ottawa. Nicolas St. Pierre provides play-by-play, with Alain Sanscartier as colour commentator.

Sportsnet East held English regional rights to the Sens before the 2014–15 season. In April 2014, Dean Brown, who had called play-by-play for Senators games since the team&#x27;s inception, stated that it was &quot;extremely unlikely&quot; that he would move to TSN and continue his role. He noted that the network already had four commentators among its personalities – including Gord Miller, Chris Cuthbert, Rod Black, and Paul Romanuk (who was, however, picked up by Rogers for its national NHL coverage in June 2014), who were likely candidates to serve as the new voices of the Senators. Brown ultimately moved to the Senators&#x27; radio broadcasts alongside Gord Wilson. Both Miller and Cuthbert, along with Ray Ferraro and Jamie McLennan, became the Senators&#x27; TV voices on TSN from 2014 to 2020. After Cuthbert joined Sportsnet in 2020, former Canucks radio voice Jon Abbott took over as the secondary play-by-play commentator in games where Miller is assigned to call the Maple Leafs. Mike Johnson, who concurrently works colour commentary for the Canadiens and Maple Leafs on TSN, replaced Ferraro as an alternate to McLennan. After Abbott left to join the Calgary Flames in 2024, broadcaster Matt Cullen (not to be confused with former Senators player Matt Cullen) and Kenzie Lalonde split time as the backup to Miller.

During the 2006–07 and 2007–08 seasons, several games were only available in video on pay-per-view or at local movie theatres in the Ottawa area. The &quot;Sens TV&quot; service was suspended indefinitely as of September 24, 2008. In 2010, Sportsnet launched a secondary channel for selected Senators games as part of its Sportsnet One service. Selected broadcasts of Senators games in the French language were broadcast by RDS and TVA Sports. On the RDS network, Felix Seguin and former Senators goaltender Patrick Lalime were the announcers from the 2011–12 season to the 2013–14 season, and Michel Y. Lacroix and Norman Flynn starting in the 2014–15 season. The TVA Sports broadcast team consisted of Michel Langevin, Yvon Pedneault and Enrico Ciccone.

<doc id="22706" wikidata="Q42998" url="?curid=22706" title="Orchestra">
<text>An orchestra (; ) is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which combines instruments from different families. There are typically four main sections of instruments:

* String instruments, such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass

* Woodwinds, such as the flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, and occasional saxophone

* Brass instruments, such as the French horn (commonly simply known as the &quot;horn&quot;), trumpet, trombone, cornet, and tuba, and sometimes euphonium

* Percussion instruments, such as the timpani, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, tambourine, tam-tam and mallet percussion instruments

Other instruments such as the piano, harpsichord, pipe organ, and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone as soloist instruments, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments, and guitars.

A full-size Western orchestra may sometimes be called a  or philharmonic orchestra (from Greek &quot;phil-&quot;, &quot;loving&quot;, and &quot;harmony&quot;). The number of musicians employed in a given performance may vary from seventy to over one hundred, depending on the work being played and the venue size. A &quot;&quot; (sometimes a &quot;concert orchestra&quot;) is a smaller ensemble of not more than about fifty musicians. Orchestras that specialize in the Baroque music of, for example, Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel, or Classical repertoire, such as that of Haydn and Mozart, tend to be smaller than orchestras performing a Romantic music repertoire such as the symphonies of Ludwig van Beethoven and Johannes Brahms. The typical orchestra grew in size throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, reaching a peak with the large orchestras of as many as 120 players called for in the works of Richard Wagner and later Gustav Mahler.

Orchestras are usually led by a conductor who directs the performance with movements of the hands and arms, often made easier for the musicians to see by using a short wooden rod known as a conductor&#x27;s baton. The conductor unifies the orchestra, sets the tempo, and shapes the sound of the ensemble. The conductor also prepares the orchestra by leading rehearsals before the public concert, in which the conductor provides instructions to the musicians on their interpretation of the music being performed.

The leader of the first violin section – commonly called the concertmaster – also plays an important role in leading the musicians. In the Baroque music era (1600–1750), orchestras were often led by the concertmaster, or by a chord-playing musician performing the basso continuo parts on a harpsichord or pipe organ, a tradition that some 20th-century and 21st-century early music ensembles continue.

Orchestras play a wide range of repertoire, including symphonies, opera and ballet overtures, concertos for solo instruments, and pit ensembles for operas, ballets, and some types of musical theatre (e.g., Gilbert and Sullivan operettas).

Amateur orchestras include youth orchestras made up of students from an elementary school, a high school, or a university, and community orchestras; typically they are made up of amateur musicians from a particular city or region.

The term &quot;orchestra&quot; derives from the Greek ὀρχήστρα (&quot;orchestra&quot;), the name for the area in front of a stage in ancient Greek theatre reserved for the Greek chorus.

==History==
===Baroque and classical eras===
In the Baroque era, the size and composition of an orchestra were not standardised. There were large differences in size, instrumentation and playing styles—and therefore in orchestral soundscapes and palettes — between the various European regions. The &quot;Baroque orchestra&quot; ranged from smaller orchestras (or ensembles) with one player per part, to larger-scale orchestras with many players per part. Examples of the smaller variety were Bach&#x27;s orchestras, for example in Koethen, where he had access to an ensemble of up to 18 players. Examples of large-scale Baroque orchestras would include Corelli&#x27;s orchestra in Rome which ranged between 35 and 80 players for day-to-day performances, being enlarged to 150 players for special occasions.

In the classical era, the orchestra became more standardized with a small to medium-sized string section and a core wind section consisting of pairs of oboes, flutes, bassoons and horns, sometimes supplemented by percussion and pairs of clarinets and trumpets.

===Beethoven&#x27;s influence===
The so-called &quot;standard complement&quot; of doubled winds and brass in the orchestra pioneered in the late 18th century and consolidated during the first half of the 19th century is generally attributed to the forces called for by Beethoven after Haydn and Mozart. Beethoven&#x27;s instrumentation almost always included paired flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns and trumpets. The exceptions are his Symphony No. 4, Violin Concerto, and Piano Concerto No. 4, which each specify a single flute. Beethoven carefully calculated the expansion of this particular timbral &quot;palette&quot; in Symphonies 3, 5, 6, and 9 for an innovative effect. The third horn in the &quot;Eroica&quot; Symphony arrives to provide not only some harmonic flexibility but also the effect of &quot;choral&quot; brass in the Trio movement. Piccolo, contrabassoon, and trombones add to the triumphal finale of his Symphony No. 5. A piccolo and a pair of trombones help deliver the effect of storm and sunshine in the Sixth, also known as the &quot;Pastoral Symphony&quot;. The Ninth asks for a second pair of horns, for reasons similar to the &quot;Eroica&quot; (four horns has since become standard); Beethoven&#x27;s use of piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and untuned percussion—plus chorus and vocal soloists—in his finale, are his earliest suggestion that the timbral boundaries of the symphony might be expanded. For several decades after his death, symphonic instrumentation was faithful to Beethoven&#x27;s well-established model, with few exceptions.

===Instrumental technology===

The invention of the piston and rotary valve by Heinrich Stölzel and Friedrich Blühmel, both Silesians, in 1815, was the first in a series of innovations which impacted the orchestra, including the development of modern keywork for the flute by Theobald Boehm and the innovations of Adolphe Sax in the woodwinds, notably the invention of the saxophone. These advances would lead Hector Berlioz to write a landmark book on instrumentation, which was the first systematic treatise on using instrumental sound as an expressive element of music.

===Wagner&#x27;s influence===
The next major expansion of symphonic practice came from Richard Wagner&#x27;s Bayreuth orchestra, founded to accompany his musical dramas. Wagner&#x27;s works for the stage were scored with unprecedented scope and complexity: indeed, his score to &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; calls for six harps. Thus, Wagner envisioned an ever-more-demanding role for the conductor of the theatre orchestra, as he elaborated in his influential work &quot;On Conducting&quot;. This brought about a revolution in orchestral composition and set the style for orchestral performance for the next eighty years. Wagner&#x27;s theories re-examined the importance of tempo, dynamics, bowing of string instruments and the role of principals in the orchestra.

===20th-century orchestra===
At the beginning of the 20th century, symphony orchestras were larger, better funded, and better trained than previously; consequently, composers could compose larger and more ambitious works. The works of Gustav Mahler were particularly innovative; in his later symphonies, such as the mammoth Symphony No. 8, Mahler pushes the furthest boundaries of orchestral size, employing large forces. By the late Romantic era, orchestras could support the most enormous forms of symphonic expression, with huge string and brass sections and an expanded range of percussion instruments. With the recording era beginning, the standards of performance were pushed to a new level, because a recorded symphony could be listened to closely and even minor errors in intonation or ensemble, which might not be noticeable in a live performance, could be heard by critics. As recording technologies improved over the 20th and 21st centuries, eventually small errors in a recording could be &quot;fixed&quot; by audio editing or overdubbing. Some older conductors and composers could remember a time when simply &quot;getting through&quot; the music as well as possible was the standard. Combined with the wider audience made possible by recording, this led to a renewed focus on particular star conductors and on a high standard of orchestral execution.

== Instrumentation ==

The typical symphony orchestra consists of four groups of related musical instruments called the woodwinds, brass, percussion, and strings. Other instruments such as the piano, accordion, and celesta may sometimes be grouped into a fifth section such as a keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and electric and electronic instruments. The orchestra, depending on the size, contains almost all of the standard instruments in each group.

In the history of the orchestra, its instrumentation has been expanded over time, often agreed to have been standardized by the classical period and Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s influence on the classical model. In the 20th and 21st century, new repertory demands expanded the instrumentation of the orchestra, resulting in a flexible use of the classical-model instruments and newly developed electric and electronic instruments in various combinations. In the mid 20th century, several attempts were made in Germany and the United States to confine the instrumentation of the symphonic orchestra exclusively to groups of one instrument. In this configuration, the symphonic orchestra consisted entirely of free-reed chromatic accordions which were modified to recreate the full range of orchestral sounds and timbres during the performance of orthodox Western classical music.
The terms &quot;symphony orchestra&quot; and &quot;philharmonic orchestra&quot; may be used to distinguish different ensembles from the same locality, such as the London Symphony Orchestra and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. A symphony or philharmonic orchestra will usually have over eighty musicians on its roster, in some cases over a hundred, but the actual number of musicians employed in a particular performance may vary according to the work being played and the size of the venue.

A &quot;chamber orchestra&quot; is usually a smaller ensemble; a major chamber orchestra might employ as many as fifty musicians, but some are much smaller. &quot;Concert orchestra&quot; is an alternative term, as in the BBC Concert Orchestra and the RTÉ Concert Orchestra.

===Expanded instrumentation===

Apart from the core orchestral complement, various other instruments are called for occasionally. These include the flugelhorn and cornet. Saxophones and classical guitars, for example, appear in some 19th- through 21st-century scores. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example Maurice Ravel&#x27;s orchestration of Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; and Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Symphonic Dances&quot;, the saxophone is included in other works, such as Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot;, Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2, Vaughan Williams&#x27; Symphonies No. 6 and No. 9, and William Walton&#x27;s &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot;, and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. The euphonium is featured in a few late Romantic and 20th century works, usually playing parts marked &quot;tenor tuba&quot;, including Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;, and Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Ein Heldenleben&quot;. The Wagner tuba, a modified member of the horn family, appears in Richard Wagner&#x27;s cycle &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; and several other works by Strauss, Igor Stravinsky (as featured in The Rite of Spring), Béla Bartók, and others; it also has a notably prominent role in Anton Bruckner&#x27;s Symphony No. 7 in E Major. Cornets appear in Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s ballet &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;La Mer&quot;, and several orchestral works by Hector Berlioz. Unless these instruments are played by members &quot;doubling&quot; on another instrument (for example, a trombone player changing to euphonium or a bassoon player switching to contrabassoon for a certain passage), orchestras typically hire freelance musicians to augment their regular ensemble.

The 20th century orchestra was far more flexible than its predecessors. In Beethoven&#x27;s and Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s time, the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments, which was very rarely modified by composers. As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as Berlioz and Mahler; some composers used multiple harps and sound effect such as the wind machine. During the 20th century, the modern orchestra was generally standardized with the modern instrumentation listed below. Nevertheless, by the mid- to late 20th century, with the development of contemporary classical music, instrumentation could practically be hand-picked by the composer (e.g., to add electric instruments such as electric guitar, electronic instruments such as synthesizers, 
ondes martenot, or trautonium, as well as other non-Western instruments, or other instruments not traditionally used in orchestras including the: bandoneon, free bass accordion, harmonica, jews harp, mandola and water percussion.

With this history in mind, the orchestra can be analysed in five eras: the Baroque era, the Classical era, early/mid-Romantic music era, late-Romantic era and combined Modern/Postmodern eras. The first is a Baroque orchestra (i.e., J.S. Bach, Handel, Vivaldi), which generally had a smaller number of performers, and in which one or more chord-playing instruments, the basso continuo group (e.g., harpsichord or pipe organ and assorted bass instruments to perform the bassline), played an important role; the second is a typical classical period orchestra (e.g., early Beethoven along with Mozart and Haydn), which used a smaller group of performers than a Romantic music orchestra and a fairly standardized instrumentation; the third is typical of an early/mid-Romantic era (e.g., Schubert, Berlioz, Schumann, Brahms); the fourth is a late-Romantic/early 20th-century orchestra (e.g., Wagner, Mahler, Stravinsky), to the common complement of a 2010-era modern orchestra (e.g., Adams, Barber, Aaron Copland, Glass, Penderecki).

==Organization==

Among the instrument groups and within each group of instruments, there is a generally accepted hierarchy. Every instrumental group (or section) has a principal who is generally responsible for leading the group and playing orchestral solos. The violins are divided into two groups, first violin and second violin, with the second violins playing in lower registers than the first violins, playing an accompaniment part, or harmonizing the melody played by the first violins. The principal first violin is called the concertmaster (or orchestra &quot;leader&quot; in the U.K.) and is not only considered the leader of the string section, but the second-in-command of the entire orchestra, behind only the conductor. The concertmaster leads the pre-concert tuning and handles musical aspects of orchestra management, such as determining the bowings for the violins or the entire string section. The concertmaster usually sits to the conductor&#x27;s left, closest to the audience. There is also a principal second violin, a principal viola, a principal cello, and a principal bass.

The principal trombone is considered the leader of the low brass section, while the principal trumpet is generally considered the leader of the entire brass section. While the oboe often provides the tuning note for the orchestra (due to a 300-year-old convention), there is generally no designated principal of the woodwind section (though in woodwind ensembles, the flute is often the presumptive leader). Instead, each principal confers with the others as equals in the case of musical differences of opinion. Most sections also have an assistant principal (or co-principal or associate principal), or in the case of the first violins, an assistant concertmaster, who often plays a tutti part in addition to replacing the principal in their absence.

A section string player plays in unison with the rest of the section, except in the case of divided (&quot;divisi&quot;) parts, where upper and lower parts in the music are often assigned to &quot;outside&quot; (nearer the audience) and &quot;inside&quot; seated players. Where a solo part is called for in a string section, the section leader invariably plays that part. The section leader (or principal) of a string section is also responsible for determining the bowings, often based on the bowings set out by the concertmaster. In some cases, the principal of a string section may use a slightly different bowing than the concertmaster, to accommodate the requirements of playing their instrument (e.g., the double-bass section). Principals of a string section will also lead entrances for their section, typically by lifting the bow before the entrance, to ensure the section plays together. Tutti wind and brass players generally play a unique but non-solo part. Section percussionists play parts assigned to them by the principal percussionist.

In modern times, the musicians are usually directed by a conductor, although early orchestras did not have one, giving this role to the concertmaster or the harpsichordist playing the continuo. Some modern orchestras also do without conductors, particularly smaller orchestras and those specializing in historically accurate (so-called &quot;period&quot;) performances of baroque and earlier music.

The most frequently performed repertoire for a symphony orchestra is Western classical music or opera. However, orchestras are used sometimes in popular music (e.g., to accompany a rock or pop band in a concert), extensively in film music, and increasingly often in video game music. Orchestras are also used in the symphonic metal genre. The term &quot;orchestra&quot; can also be applied to a jazz ensemble, for example in the performance of big-band music.

===Selection and appointment of members===
In the 2000s, all tenured members of a professional orchestra normally audition for positions in the ensemble. Performers typically play one or more solo pieces of the auditionee&#x27;s choice, such as a movement of a concerto, a solo Bach movement, and a variety of excerpts from the orchestral literature that are advertised in the audition poster (so the auditionees can prepare). The excerpts are typically the most technically challenging parts and solos from the orchestral literature. Orchestral auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the conductor, the concertmaster, the principal player of the section for which the auditionee is applying, and possibly other principal players.

The most promising candidates from the first round of auditions are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to sight read orchestral music. The final stage of the audition process in some orchestras is a &quot;test week&quot;, in which the performer plays with the orchestra for a week or two, which allows the conductor and principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual rehearsal and performance setting.

There are a range of different employment arrangements. The most sought-after positions are permanent, tenured positions in the orchestra. Orchestras also hire musicians on contracts, ranging in length from a single concert to a full season or more. Contract performers may be hired for individual concerts when the orchestra is doing an exceptionally large late-Romantic era orchestral work, or to substitute for a permanent member who is sick. A professional musician who is hired to perform for a single concert is sometimes called a &quot;sub&quot;. Some contract musicians may be hired to replace permanent members for the period that the permanent member is on parental leave or disability leave.

====History of gender in ensembles====
Historically, major professional orchestras have been mostly or entirely composed of men. The first women members hired in professional orchestras have been harpists. The Vienna Philharmonic, for example, did not accept women to permanent membership until 1997, far later than comparable orchestras (the other orchestras ranked among the world&#x27;s top five by &quot;Gramophone&quot; in 2008). The last major orchestra to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the Berlin Philharmonic. In February 1996, the Vienna Philharmonic&#x27;s principal flute, Dieter Flury, told &quot;Westdeutscher Rundfunk&quot; that accepting women would be &quot;gambling with the emotional unity () that this organism currently has&quot;. In April 1996, the orchestra&#x27;s press secretary wrote that &quot;compensating for the expected leaves of absence&quot; of maternity leave would be a problem.

In 1997, the Vienna Philharmonic was &quot;facing protests during a [US] tour&quot; by the National Organization for Women and the International Alliance for Women in Music. Finally, &quot;after being held up to increasing ridicule even in socially conservative Austria, members of the orchestra gathered [on 28 February 1997] in an extraordinary meeting on the eve of their departure and agreed to admit a woman, Anna Lelkes, as harpist.&quot; As of 2013, the orchestra has six female members; one of them, violinist Albena Danailova, became one of the orchestra&#x27;s concertmasters in 2008, the first woman to hold that position in that orchestra. In 2012, women made up 6% of the orchestra&#x27;s membership. VPO president Clemens Hellsberg said the VPO now uses completely screened blind auditions.

In 2013, an article in &quot;Mother Jones&quot; stated that while &quot;[m]any prestigious orchestras have significant female membership — women outnumber men in the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s violin section — and several renowned ensembles, including the National Symphony Orchestra, the Detroit Symphony, and the Minnesota Symphony, are led by women violinists&quot;, the double bass, brass, and percussion sections of major orchestras &quot;... are still predominantly male.&quot; A 2014 BBC article stated that the &quot;... introduction of &#x27;blind&#x27; auditions, where a prospective instrumentalist performs behind a screen so that the judging panel can exercise no gender or racial prejudice, has seen the gender balance of traditionally male-dominated symphony orchestras gradually shift.&quot;

==Amateur ensembles==
There are also a variety of amateur orchestras:
; School orchestras: These orchestras consist of students from elementary or secondary school. They may be students from a music class or program or they may be drawn from the entire school body. School orchestras are typically led by a music teacher. In some cases, school orchestras are string orchestras, consisting only of students playing string instruments, with students playing woodwinds, brass and percussion grouped together as a concert band.
; University or conservatory orchestras: These orchestras consist of students from a university or music conservatory. In some cases, university orchestras are open to all students from a university, from all programs. Larger universities may have two or more university orchestras: one or more orchestras made up of music majors (or, for major music programs, several tiers of music major orchestras, ranked by skill level) and a second orchestra open to university students from all academic programs (e.g., science, business, etc.) who have previous classical music experience on an orchestral instrument. University and conservatory orchestras are led by a conductor who is typically a professor or instructor at the university or conservatory.
; Youth orchestras: These orchestras consist of teens and young adults drawn from an entire city or region. The age range in youth orchestras varies between different ensembles. In some cases, youth orchestras may consist of teens or young adults from an entire country (e.g., Canada&#x27;s National Youth Orchestra).
; Community orchestras: These orchestras consist of amateur performers drawn from an entire city or region. Community orchestras typically consist mainly of adult amateur musicians. Community orchestras range in level from beginner-level orchestras which rehearse music without doing formal performances in front of an audience to intermediate-level ensembles to advanced amateur groups which play standard professional orchestra repertoire. In some cases, university or conservatory music students may also be members of community orchestras. While community orchestra members are mostly unpaid amateurs, in some orchestras, a small number of professionals may be hired to act as principal players and section leaders.

==Repertoire and performances==
Orchestras play a wide range of repertoire ranging from 17th-century dance suites, 18th century divertimentos to 20th-century film scores and 21st-century symphonies. Orchestras have become synonymous with the symphony, an extended musical composition in Western classical music that typically contains multiple movements which provide contrasting keys and tempos. Symphonies are notated in a musical score, which contains all the instrument parts. The conductor uses the score to study the symphony before rehearsals and decide on their interpretation (e.g., tempos, articulation, phrasing, etc.), and to follow the music during rehearsals and concerts, while leading the ensemble. Orchestral musicians play from parts containing just the notated music for their instrument. A small number of symphonies also contain vocal parts (e.g., Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony).

Orchestras also perform overtures, a term originally applied to the instrumental introduction to an opera. During the early Romantic era, composers such as Beethoven and Mendelssohn began to use the term to refer to independent, self-existing instrumental, programmatic works that presaged genres such as the symphonic poem, a form devised by Franz Liszt in several works that began as dramatic overtures. These were &quot;at first undoubtedly intended to be played at the head of a programme&quot;. In the 1850s the concert overture began to be supplanted by the symphonic poem.

Orchestras also play with instrumental soloists in concertos. During concertos, the orchestra plays an accompaniment role to the soloist (e.g., a solo violinist or pianist) and, at times, introduces musical themes or interludes while the soloist is not playing. Orchestras also play during operas, ballets, some musical theatre works and some choral works (both sacred works such as Masses and secular works). In operas and ballets, the orchestra accompanies the singers and dancers, respectively, and plays overtures and interludes where the melodies played by the orchestra take centre stage.

===Performances===
In the Baroque era, orchestras performed in a range of venues, including at the fine houses of aristocrats, in opera halls and in churches. Some wealthy aristocrats had an orchestra in residence at their estate, to entertain them and their guests with performances. During the Classical era, as composers increasingly sought out financial support from the general public, orchestra concerts were increasingly held in public concert halls, where music lovers could buy tickets to hear the orchestra. Aristocratic patronage of orchestras continued during the Classical era, but this went on alongside public concerts. In the 20th and 21st century, orchestras found a new patron: governments. Many orchestras in North America and Europe receive part of their funding from national, regional level governments (e.g., state governments in the U.S.) or city governments. These government subsidies make up part of orchestra revenue, along with ticket sales, charitable donations (if the orchestra is registered as a charity) and other fundraising activities. With the invention of successive technologies, including sound recording, radio broadcasting, television broadcasting and Internet-based streaming and downloading of concert videos, orchestras have been able to find new revenue sources.

===Issues in performance===
====Faking====

One of the &quot;great unmentionable [topics] of orchestral playing&quot; is &quot;faking&quot;, the process by which an orchestral musician gives the false &quot;... impression of playing every note as written&quot;, typically for a very challenging passage that is very high or very fast, while not actually playing the notes that are in the printed music part. An article in &quot;The Strad&quot; states that all orchestral musicians, even those in the top orchestras, occasionally fake certain passages. One reason that musicians fake is because there are not enough rehearsals. Another factor is the extreme challenges in 20th century and 21st century contemporary pieces; some professionals said &quot;faking&quot; was &quot;necessary in anything from ten to almost ninety per cent of some modern works&quot;. Professional players who were interviewed were of a consensus that faking may be acceptable when a part is not written well for the instrument, but faking &quot;just because you haven&#x27;t practised&quot; the music is not acceptable.

===Counter-revolution===
With the advent of the early music movement, smaller orchestras where players worked on execution of works in styles derived from the study of older treatises on playing became common. These include the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, the London Classical Players under the direction of Sir Roger Norrington and the Academy of Ancient Music under Christopher Hogwood, among others.

===Recent trends in the United States===
In the United States, the late 20th century saw a crisis of funding and support for orchestras. The size and cost of a symphony orchestra, compared to the size of the base of supporters, became an issue that struck at the core of the institution. Few orchestras could fill auditoriums, and the time-honored season-subscription system became increasingly anachronistic, as more and more listeners would buy tickets on an &quot;ad-hoc&quot; basis for individual events. Orchestral endowments and — more centrally to the daily operation of American orchestras — orchestral donors have seen investment portfolios shrink, or produce lower yields, reducing the ability of donors to contribute; further, there has been a trend toward donors finding other social causes more compelling. While government funding is less central to American than European orchestras, cuts in such funding are still significant for American ensembles. Finally, the drastic drop in revenues from recording, related to changes in the recording industry itself, began a period of change that has yet to reach its conclusion.

U.S. orchestras that have gone into Chapter 11 bankruptcy include the Philadelphia Orchestra (April 2011), and the Louisville Orchestra (December 2010); orchestras that have gone into Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have ceased operations include the Northwest Chamber Orchestra in 2006, the Honolulu Orchestra in March 2011, the New Mexico Symphony Orchestra in April 2011, and the Syracuse Symphony in June 2011. The Festival of Orchestras in Orlando, Florida, ceased operations at the end of March 2011.

One source of financial difficulties that received notice and criticism was high salaries for music directors of US orchestras, which led several high-profile conductors to take pay cuts in recent years. Music administrators such as Michael Tilson Thomas and Esa-Pekka Salonen argued that new music, new means of presenting it, and a renewed relationship with the community could revitalize the symphony orchestra. The American critic Greg Sandow has argued in detail that orchestras must revise their approach to music, performance, the concert experience, marketing, public relations, community involvement, and presentation to bring them in line with the expectations of 21st century audiences immersed in popular culture.

It is not uncommon for contemporary composers to use unconventional instruments, including various synthesizers, to achieve desired effects. Many, however, find more conventional orchestral configuration to provide better possibilities for color and depth. Composers like John Adams often employ Romantic-size orchestras, as in Adams&#x27; opera &quot;Nixon in China&quot;; Philip Glass and others may be more free, yet still identify size-boundaries. Glass in particular has recently turned to conventional orchestras in works like the &quot;Concerto for Cello and Orchestra&quot; and the Violin Concerto No. 2.

Along with a decrease in funding, some U.S. orchestras have reduced their overall personnel, as well as the number of players appearing in performances. The reduced numbers in performance are usually confined to the string section, since the numbers here have traditionally been flexible (as multiple players typically play from the same part).

==Role of conductor==

Conducting is the art of directing a musical performance, such as an orchestral or choral concert. The primary duties of the conductor are to set the tempo, ensure correct entries by various members of the ensemble, and &quot;shape&quot; the phrasing where appropriate. To convey their ideas and interpretation, a conductor communicates with their musicians primarily through hand gestures, typically (though not invariably) with the aid of a baton, and may use other gestures or signals, such as eye contact with relevant performers. A conductor&#x27;s directions will almost invariably be supplemented or reinforced by verbal instructions or suggestions to their musicians in rehearsal prior to a performance.

The conductor typically stands on a raised podium with a large music stand for the full score, which contains the musical notation for all the instruments and voices. Since the mid-18th century, most conductors have not played an instrument when conducting, although in earlier periods of classical music history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. In Baroque music from the 1600s to the 1750s, the group would typically be led by the harpsichordist or first violinist (see concertmaster), an approach that in modern times has been revived by several music directors for music from this period. Conducting while playing a piano or synthesizer may also be done with musical theatre pit orchestras. Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in art music, but in jazz big bands or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions, such as a &quot;count in&quot;). However, in rehearsals, frequent interruptions allow the conductor to give verbal directions as to how the music should be played or sung.

Conductors act as guides to the orchestras or choirs they conduct. They choose the works to be performed and study their scores, to which they may make certain adjustments (e.g., regarding tempo, articulation, phrasing, repetitions of sections, and so on), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the performers. They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals, planning a concert season, hearing auditions and selecting members, and promoting their ensemble in the media. Orchestras, choirs, concert bands and other sizable musical ensembles such as big bands are usually led by conductors.

===Conductorless orchestras===

In the Baroque music era (1600–1750), most orchestras were led by one of the musicians, typically the principal first violin, called the concertmaster. The concertmaster would lead the tempo of pieces by lifting his or her bow in a rhythmic manner. Leadership might also be provided by one of the chord-playing instrumentalists playing the basso continuo part which was the core of most Baroque instrumental ensemble pieces. Typically, this would be a harpsichord player, a pipe organist, or a lutist or theorbo player. A keyboard player could lead the ensemble with his or her head, or by taking one of the hands off the keyboard to lead a more difficult tempo change. A lutenist or theorbo player could lead by lifting the instrument neck up and down to indicate the tempo of a piece, or to lead a ritard during a cadence or ending. In some works which combined choirs and instrumental ensembles, two leaders were sometimes used: A concertmaster to lead the instrumentalists and a chord-playing performer to lead the singers. During the Classical music period (), the practice of using chordal instruments to play basso continuo was gradually phased out, and it disappeared completely by 1800. Instead, ensembles began to use conductors to lead the orchestra&#x27;s tempos and playing style, while the concertmaster played an additional leadership role for the musicians, especially the string players, who imitate the bowstroke and playing style of the concertmaster, to the degree that is feasible for the different stringed instruments.

In 1922, the idea of a conductor-less orchestra was revived in post-revolutionary Soviet Union. The symphony orchestra Persimfans was formed without a conductor, because the founders believed that the ensemble should be modeled on the ideal Marxist state, in which all people are equal. As such, its members felt that there was no need to be led by the dictatorial baton of a conductor; instead they were led by a committee, which determined tempos and playing styles. Although it was a partial success within the Soviet Union, the principal difficulty with the concept was in changing tempo during performances, because even if the committee had issued a decree about where a tempo change should take place, there was no leader in the ensemble to guide this tempo change. The orchestra survived for ten years before Stalin&#x27;s cultural politics disbanded it by taking away its funding.

In Western nations, some ensembles, such as the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, based in New York City, have had more success with conductorless orchestras, although decisions are likely to be deferred to some sense of leadership within the ensemble (for example, the principal wind and string players, notably the concertmaster). Others have returned to the tradition of a principal player, usually a violinist, being the artistic director and running rehearsal and leading concerts. Examples include the Australian Chamber Orchestra, Amsterdam Sinfonietta &amp; Candida Thompson and the New Century Chamber Orchestra. As well, as part of the early music movement, some 20th and 21st century orchestras have revived the Baroque practice of having no conductor on the podium for Baroque pieces, using the concertmaster or a chord-playing basso continuo performer (e.g., harpsichord or organ) to lead the group.

===Multiple conductors===
====Offstage instruments====
Some orchestral works specify that an offstage trumpet should be used or that other instruments from the orchestra should be positioned off-stage or behind the stage, to create a haunted, mystical effect. To ensure that the offstage play in time, sometimes a sub-conductor will be stationed offstage with a clear view of the principal conductor. Examples include the ending of &quot;Neptune&quot; from Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;. The principal conductor leads the large orchestra, and the sub-conductor relays the principal conductor&#x27;s tempo and gestures to the offstage musician (or musicians). One of the challenges with using two conductors is that the second conductor may get out of synchronization with the main conductor, or may mis-convey (or misunderstand) the principal conductor&#x27;s gestures, which can lead to the offstage instruments being out of time. In the late 20th century and early 21st century, some orchestras use a video camera pointed at the principal conductor and a closed-circuit TV set in front of the offstage performers, instead of using two conductors.

====Contemporary music====
The techniques of polystylism and polytempo music have led a few 20th and 21st century composers to write music where multiple orchestras or ensembles perform simultaneously. These trends have brought about the phenomenon of polyconductor music, wherein separate sub-conductors conduct each group of musicians. Usually, one principal conductor conducts the sub-conductors, thereby shaping the overall performance. In Percy Grainger&#x27;s &quot;The Warriors&quot; which includes three conductors: the primary conductor of the orchestra, a secondary conductor directing an off-stage brass ensemble, and a tertiary conductor directing percussion and harp. One example in the late-century orchestral music is Karlheinz Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Gruppen&quot;, for three orchestras, which are placed around the audience. This way, the &quot;sound masses&quot; could be spatialized, as in an electroacoustic work. &quot;Gruppen&quot; was premiered in Cologne, in 1958, conducted by Stockhausen, Bruno Maderna and Pierre Boulez. It has been performed in 1996 by Simon Rattle, John Carewe and Daniel Harding.

<text>Oolong (, ; ; , &quot;black dragon&quot; tea) is a traditional semi-oxidized Chinese tea (&quot;Camellia sinensis)&quot; produced through a process that includes withering the leaves under strong sun and allowing some oxidation to occur before curling and twisting. Most oolong teas, especially those of fine quality, involve unique tea plant cultivars that are exclusively used for particular varieties. The degree of oxidation, which is controlled by the length of time between picking and final drying, can range from 8% to 85% depending on the variety and production style. Oolong is especially popular in southeastern China and among ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia, as is the Fujian preparation process known as the gongfu tea ceremony.

Different styles of oolong tea can vary widely in flavor. They can be sweet and fruity with honey aromas, woody and thick with roasted aromas, or green and fresh with complex aromas, all depending on the horticulture and style of production. Several types of oolong tea, including those produced in the Wuyi Mountains, Nanping of northern Fujian, such as Da Hong Pao, are among the most famous Chinese teas. Different varieties of oolong are processed differently, but the leaves are usually formed into one of two distinct styles. Some are rolled into long curly leaves, while others are &quot;wrap-curled&quot; into small beads, each with a tail. The former style is the more traditional.

The Chinese term (oolong) was first used to describe a tea in the 1857 text &quot;Miscellaneous Notes on Fujian&quot; by Shi Hongbao. In Taiwan, oolong teas are also known as () or &quot;dark green teas&quot; since early 2000. The term &quot;blue tea&quot; () in French is used to refer to oolong tea. Oolong teas share some characteristics with both green and black teas – they have light flavour notes but are often more complex in taste than green teas, and not as strong as black teas.

The manufacturing of oolong tea involves repeating stages to achieve the desired amount of bruising and browning of leaves. Withering, rolling, shaping, and firing are similar to the process for black tea, but much more attention to timing and temperature is necessary.

==Possible origins==
There are three widely espoused explanations of the origin of the name of Oolong tea. According to the &quot;tribute tea&quot; theory, oolong tea came directly from Dragon-Phoenix Tea Cake tribute tea. The name oolong tea replaced the old title when loose tea came into fashion. Since it was dark, long, and curly, it was called &quot;Black Dragon&quot; tea, leading to the Oolong name.

==Varieties==

===Fujian===
Tea production in Fujian is concentrated in two regions: the Wuyi Mountains and Anxi County, Quanzhou. Both are major historical centers of oolong tea production in China.

====Wuyi Mountains====

The most famous and expensive oolong teas are made here, and the production is still usually accredited as being organic. Some of the better known cliff teas are:
* Da Hong Pao (&quot;Big Red Robe&quot;): a highly prized tea and a Si Da Ming Cong tea. This tea is also one of the two oolong varieties classed as a famous Chinese tea.
* Shui Jin Gui (&quot;Golden Water Turtle&quot;): a Si Da Ming Cong tea.
* Tieluohan (&quot;Iron Arhat&quot;): a Si Da Ming Cong tea.
* Bai Jiguan (&quot;White Cockscomb&quot;): a Si Da Ming Cong tea. A light tea with light, yellowish leaves.
* Rougui (&quot;Cassia&quot;): a dark tea with a spicy aroma.
* Shui Xian (&quot;Narcissus&quot;): a very dark tea. Much of it is grown elsewhere in Fujian.

====Anxi====
* Tieguanyin (&quot;Iron Goddess of Mercy&quot;): one of the Ten Famous Chinese Teas.
* Huangjin Gui (&quot;Golden Cassia&quot; or &quot;Golden Osmanthus&quot;): similar to Tieguanyin, with a very fragrant flavor.

===Guangdong===

Single Bush &quot;Dancong&quot; () (&quot;Phoenix oolong&quot;)

 refers to a family of strip-style oolong teas from Guangdong Province. They are noted for their ability to naturally imitate the flavors and fragrances of various flowers and fruits, such as orange blossom, orchid, grapefruit, almond, ginger flower, etc.

The term &quot;dancong&quot; originally meant phoenix teas all picked from one tree. In recent times, though, it has become a generic term for all Phoenix Mountain oolongs. True dancongs are still produced, but are not common outside China.

===Taiwan===

Tea cultivation in Taiwan began in the 18th century. Since then, many of the teas which are grown in Fujian province have also been grown in Taiwan. Since the 1970s, the tea industry in Taiwan has expanded at a rapid rate, in line with the rest of the economy. Due to high domestic demand and a strong tea culture, most Taiwanese tea is bought and consumed in Taiwan.

As the weather in Taiwan is highly variable, tea quality may differ from season to season. Although the island is not particularly large, it is geographically varied, with high, steep mountains rising abruptly from low-lying coastal plains. The different weather patterns, temperatures, altitudes, and soil ultimately result in differences in the appearance, aroma, and flavour of the tea grown in Taiwan. In some mountainous areas, teas have been cultivated at ever higher elevations to produce a unique, sweet taste that fetches a premium price.

* Dong Ding (&quot;Frozen Summit&quot; or &quot;Ice Peak&quot;): Named after the mountain in Nantou County, Central Taiwan, where it is grown. This is a tightly rolled tea with a light, distinctive fragrance.
* Dongfang meiren (&quot;Oriental Beauty&quot;): This type of tea exhibits very potent aromatics because of increased levels of terpenes. This is due to the processing of the leaf as well as the tea plants being attacked by the Jassid (&quot;Leaf Hopper&quot;) insect, before picking. The tea is picked in summer at lower elevations because this is the environment most likely to attract these types of insects.
* Alishan oolong: Grown in the Alishan area of Chiayi County, this tea has large rolled leaves that have a purple-green appearance when dry. It is grown at an elevation of . There is only a short period during the growing season when the sun is strong, which results in a sweeter and less astringent brew. It produces golden yellow tea with a unique fruity aroma.
* Lishan () oolong: Grown near Lishan mountain in the north-central region of Taiwan, this tea is very similar in appearance to Alishan teas. It is grown at an elevation above , with Dayuling, and Fushou being the well known regions and teas along Lishan.
* Baozhong: the least oxidized of the oolong teas from Taiwan, with unrolled leaves of a light green to brown color. Originally grown in Fujian, it is now also widely cultivated and produced in Pinglin Township near Taipei.
* Ruan zhi: a light variety of oolong tea. The tea is also known as Qingxin and as # 17. It originates from Anxi in Fujian province.
*Jin Xuan: a variety of oolong tea developed in 1980. The tea is also known as &quot;Milk Oolong&quot; (&quot;Nai Xiang&quot;) because of its creamy, smooth, and easy taste. Traditional milk oolong tea does not contain milk. It originates from Taiwan.
*Black Oolong: may refer to a dark roasted oolong. This will have a roasted flavor similar to dark roast coffee.
*High-mountain or gaoshan: refers to several varieties of oolong tea grown in the mountains of central Taiwan. Includes varieties such as Alishan, Wu She, Li Shan and Yu Shan.
*Tieguanyin: Muzha Tea Co. brought the tea from Anxi County and developed Taiwan&#x27;s own variation of the popular tea on the hills of Muzha area near Taipei. While the techniques they used were similar to Anxi tieguanyin, the tastes have evolved during over a century of development.
*Sijichun Oolong: Also known as Four Seasons Oolong Tea, a beloved and popular choice in Taiwan. Originating in Maokong, Mucha, Taipei, this tea is renowned for its year-round harvest, allowing it to be cultivated across Taiwan.

===Other varieties===
* Darjeeling oolong: Darjeeling tea made according to Chinese methods.
* Assam smoked oolong: Assam&#x27;s tea made according to Chinese methods, and smoked over open fire.
* Vietnamese oolong.
* Apart from varieties based on origin of cultivation, new age specialty tea companies have started offering infused oolong teas.

==Preparation==
Recommended brewing techniques for oolong tea vary widely. One common method is to use a small steeping vessel, such as a gaiwan or Yixing clay teapot, with a higher than usual leaf to water ratio. Such vessels are used in the gongfu method of tea preparation, which involves multiple short steepings.

For a single infusion, 1- to 5-minute steepings are recommended, depending on personal preference. The recommended water temperature ranges from .

==Characteristics==

===Caffeine===
Oolong contains caffeine, although the caffeine content in tea will vary based on terroir, when the leaf is plucked, and the production processes.

===Teaghrelins===
Some semi-oxidized oolong teas contain acylated flavonoid tetraglycosides, named teaghrelins due to their ability to bind to ghrelin receptors. Teaghrelins were isolated from Chin-shin oolong tea and Shy‐jih‐chuen oolong tea and recently from other oolong tea varieties.

==In the United States==

Oolong tea has been served in Chinese restaurants in the United States at least since the early decades of the 20th century.

<text>The okapi (; Okapia johnstoni), also known as the forest giraffe, Congolese giraffe and zebra giraffe, is an artiodactyl mammal that is endemic to the northeast Democratic Republic of the Congo in central Africa. However, non-invasive genetic identification has suggested that a population has occurred south-west of the Congo River as well. It is the only species in the genus Okapia. Although the okapi has striped markings reminiscent of zebras, it is most closely related to the giraffe. The okapi and the giraffe are the only living members of the family Giraffidae.

The okapi stands about tall at the shoulder and has a typical body length around . Its weight ranges from . It has a long neck, and large, flexible ears. Its coat is a chocolate to reddish brown, much in contrast with the white horizontal stripes and rings on the legs, and white ankles. Male okapis have short, distinct horn-like protuberances on their heads called ossicones, less than in length. Females possess hair whorls, and ossicones are absent.

Okapis are primarily diurnal, but may be active for a few hours in darkness. They are essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. Okapis are herbivores, feeding on tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. Rut in males and estrus in females does not depend on the season. In captivity, estrus cycles recur every 15 days. The gestational period is around 440 to 450 days long, following which usually a single calf is born. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months.

Okapis inhabit canopy forests at altitudes of . The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources classifies the okapi as endangered. Major threats include habitat loss due to logging and human settlement. Illegal mining and extensive hunting for bushmeat and skin have also led to a decline in populations. The Okapi Conservation Project was established in 1987 to protect okapi populations.

==Etymology and taxonomy==
Although the okapi was unknown to the Western world until the 20th century, it may have been depicted since the early fifth century BCE on the façade of the Apadana at Persepolis, a gift from the Ethiopian procession to the Achaemenid kingdom.

For years, Europeans in Africa had heard of an animal that they came to call the African unicorn. The animal was brought to prominent European attention by speculation on its existence found in press reports covering Henry Morton Stanley&#x27;s journeys in 1887. In his travelogue of exploring the Congo, Stanley mentioned a kind of donkey that the natives called the &quot;atti&quot;, which scholars later identified as the okapi.

When the British special commissioner in Uganda, Sir Harry Johnston, discovered some Pygmy inhabitants of the Congo being abducted by a showman for exhibition, he rescued them and promised to return them to their homes. The Pygmies fed Johnston&#x27;s curiosity about the animal mentioned in Stanley&#x27;s book. Johnston was puzzled by the okapi tracks the natives showed him; while he had expected to be on the trail of some sort of forest-dwelling horse, the tracks were of a cloven-hoofed beast.

Though Johnston did not see an okapi himself, he did manage to obtain pieces of striped skin and eventually a skull. From this skull, the okapi was correctly classified as a relative of the giraffe; in 1901, the species was formally recognized as &quot;Okapia johnstoni&quot;.

&quot;Okapia johnstoni&quot; was first described as &quot;Equus johnstoni&quot; by English zoologist Philip Lutley Sclater in 1901. The generic name &quot;Okapia&quot; derives either from the Mbuba name or the related Lese Karo name , while the specific name (&quot;johnstoni&quot;) is in recognition of Johnston, who first acquired an okapi specimen for science from the Ituri Forest.

In 1901, Sclater presented a painting of the okapi before the Zoological Society of London that depicted its physical features with some clarity. Much confusion arose regarding the taxonomical status of this newly discovered animal. Sir Harry Johnston himself called it a &quot;Helladotherium&quot;, or a relative of other extinct giraffids. Based on the description of the okapi by Pygmies, who referred to it as a &quot;horse&quot;, Sclater named the species &quot;Equus johnstoni&quot;. Subsequently, zoologist Ray Lankester declared that the okapi represented an unknown genus of the Giraffidae, which he placed in its own genus, &quot;Okapia&quot;, and assigned the name &quot;Okapia johnstoni&quot; to the species.

In 1902, Swiss zoologist Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major suggested the inclusion of &quot;O. johnstoni&quot; in the extinct giraffid subfamily Palaeotraginae. However, the species was placed in its own subfamily Okapiinae, by Swedish palaeontologist Birger Bohlin in 1926, mainly due to the lack of a cingulum, a major feature of the palaeotragids. In 1986, &quot;Okapia&quot; was finally established as a sister genus of &quot;Giraffa&quot; on the basis of cladistic analysis. The two genera together with &quot;Palaeotragus&quot; constitute the tribe Giraffini.

===Evolution===

The earliest members of the Giraffidae first appeared in the early Miocene in Africa, having diverged from the superficially deer-like climacoceratids. Giraffids spread into Europe and Asia by the middle Miocene in a first radiation. Another radiation began in the Pliocene, but was terminated by a decline in diversity in the Pleistocene. Several important primitive giraffids existed more or less contemporaneously in the Miocene (23–10 million years ago), including &quot;Canthumeryx&quot;, &quot;Giraffokeryx&quot;, &quot;Palaeotragus&quot;, and &quot;Samotherium&quot;. According to palaeontologist and author Kathleen Hunt, &quot;Samotherium&quot; split into &quot;Okapia&quot; (18 million years ago) and &quot;Giraffa&quot; (12 million years ago). However, J. D. Skinner argued that &quot;Canthumeryx&quot; gave rise to the okapi and giraffe through the latter three genera and that the okapi is the extant form of &quot;Palaeotragus&quot;. The okapi is sometimes referred to as a living fossil, as it has existed as a species over a long geological time period, and morphologically resembles more primitive forms (e.g. &quot;Samotherium&quot;).

In 2016, a genetic study found that the common ancestor of giraffe and okapi lived about 11.5 million years ago.

==Description==

The okapi is a medium-sized giraffid, standing tall at the shoulder. Its average body length is about and its weight ranges from . It has a long neck, and large and flexible ears. In sharp contrast to the white horizontal stripes on the legs and white ankles, the okapi&#x27;s coat is a chocolate to reddish brown. The distinctive stripes resemble those of a zebra. These features serve as an effective camouflage amidst dense vegetation. The face, throat, and chest are greyish white. Interdigital glands are present on all four feet, and are slightly larger on the front feet. Male okapis have short, hair-covered horn-like structures called ossicones, less than in length, which are similar in form and function to the ossicones of a giraffe. The okapi exhibits sexual dimorphism, with females taller on average, slightly redder, and lacking prominent ossicones, instead possessing hair whorls.

The okapi shows several adaptations to its tropical habitat. The large number of rod cells in the retina facilitate night vision, and an efficient olfactory system is present. The large auditory bullae of the temporal bone allow a strong sense of hearing. The dental formula of the okapi is . Teeth are low-crowned and finely cusped, and efficiently cut tender foliage. The large cecum and colon help in microbial digestion, and a quick rate of food passage allows for lower cell wall digestion than in other ruminants.
The okapi is easily distinguished from its nearest extant relative, the giraffe. It is much smaller than the giraffe and shares more external similarities with bovids and cervids. Ossicones are present only in the male okapi, while both sexes of giraffe possess this feature. The okapi has large palatine sinuses (hollow cavities in the palate), unique among the giraffids. Morphological features shared between the giraffe and the okapi include a similar gait – both use a pacing gait, stepping simultaneously with the front and the hind leg on the same side of the body, unlike other ungulates that walk by moving alternate legs on either side of the body – and a long, black tongue (longer in the okapi) useful for plucking buds and leaves, as well as for grooming.

==Ecology and behaviour==
Okapis are primarily diurnal, but may be active for a few hours in darkness. They are essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. They have overlapping home ranges and typically occur at densities around 0.6 animals per square kilometre. Male home ranges average , while female home ranges average . Males migrate continuously, while females are sedentary. Males often mark territories and bushes with their urine, while females use common defecation sites. Grooming is a common practice, focused at the earlobes and the neck. Okapis often rub their necks against trees, leaving a brown exudate.

The male is protective of his territory, but allows females to pass through the domain to forage. Males visit female home ranges at breeding time. Although generally tranquil, the okapi can kick and butt with its head to show aggression. As the vocal cords are poorly developed, vocal communication is mainly restricted to three sounds — &quot;chuff&quot; (contact calls used by both sexes), &quot;moan&quot; (by females during courtship) and &quot;bleat&quot; (by infants under stress). Individuals may engage in Flehmen response, a visual expression in which the animal curls back its upper lips, displays the teeth, and inhales through the mouth for a few seconds. The leopard is the main natural predator of the okapi.

===Diet===

Okapis are herbivores, feeding on tree leaves and buds, branches, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. They are unique in the Ituri Forest as they are the only known mammal that feeds solely on understory vegetation, where they use their tongues to selectively browse for suitable plants. The tongue is also used to groom their ears and eyes. They prefer to feed in treefall gaps. The okapi has been known to feed on over 100 species of plants, some of which are known to be poisonous to humans and other animals. Fecal analysis shows that none of those 100 species dominates the diet of the okapi. Staple foods comprise shrubs and lianas. The main constituents of the diet are woody, dicotyledonous species; monocotyledonous plants are not eaten regularly. In the Ituri forest, the okapi feeds mainly upon the plant families Acanthaceae, Ebenaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Loganiaceae, Rubiaceae, and Violaceae.

===Reproduction===

Female okapis become sexually mature at about one-and-a-half years old, while males reach maturity after two years. Rut in males and estrus in females does not depend on the season. In captivity, estrous cycles recur every 15 days. The male and the female begin courtship by circling, smelling, and licking each other. The male shows his interest by extending his neck, tossing his head, and protruding one leg forward. This is followed by mounting and copulation.

The gestational period is around 440 to 450 days long, following which usually a single calf is born, weighing . The udder of the pregnant female starts swelling 2 months before parturition, and vulval discharges may occur. Parturition takes 3–4 hours, and the female stands throughout this period, though she may rest during brief intervals. The mother consumes the afterbirth and extensively grooms the infant. Her milk is very rich in proteins and low in fat.

As in other ruminants, the infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Although generally similar to adults, newborn calves have long hairs around the eye (resembling false eyelashes), a long dorsal mane, and long white hairs in the stripes. These features gradually disappear and give way to the general appearance within a year. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. Calves are known not to defecate for the first month or two of life, which is hypothesized to help avoid predator detection in their most vulnerable phase of life. The growth rate of calves is appreciably high in the first few months of life, after which it gradually declines. Juveniles start taking solid food from 3 months, and weaning takes place at 6 months. Ossicone development in males takes 1 year after birth. The okapi&#x27;s typical lifespan is 20–30 years.

==Distribution and habitat==
The okapi is endemic to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where it occurs north and east of the Congo River. It ranges from the Maiko National Park northward to the Ituri rainforest, then through the river basins of the Rubi, Lake Tele, and Ebola to the west and the Ubangi River further north. Smaller populations exist west and south of the Congo River. It is also common in the Wamba and Epulu areas. It is extinct in Uganda.

The okapi inhabits canopy forests at elevations of . It occasionally uses seasonally inundated areas, but does not occur in gallery forests, swamp forests, and habitats disturbed by human settlements. In the wet season, it visits rocky inselbergs that offer forage uncommon elsewhere. Results of research conducted in the late 1980s in a mixed &quot;Cynometra&quot; forest indicated that the okapi population density averaged 0.53 animals per square kilometre. In 2008, it was recorded in Virunga National Park. There is also evidence that okapis were also observed in the Semuliki Valley in Uganda by Europeans, but later became extinct in the late 1970s. The Semuliki Valley provides a similar habitat to the Congo Basin.

===Threats and conservation===
The IUCN classifies the okapi as endangered. It is fully protected under Congolese law. The Okapi Wildlife Reserve and Maiko National Park support significant populations of the okapi, though a steady decline in numbers has occurred due to several threats. Other areas of occurrence are the Rubi Tele Hunting Reserve, the Abumombanzi Reserve, the 
Sankuru Nature Reserve, the Lomami National Park. Major threats include habitat loss due to logging and human settlement. Extensive hunting for bushmeat and skin and illegal mining have also led to population declines. A threat that has emerged quite recently is the presence of illegal armed groups around protected areas, inhibiting conservation and monitoring actions. A small population occurs north of the Virunga National Park, but lacks protection due to the presence of armed groups in the vicinity. In June 2012, a gang of poachers attacked the headquarters of the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, killing six guards and other staff as well as all 14 okapis at their breeding center.

The Okapi Conservation Project, established in 1987, works towards the conservation of the okapi, as well as the growth of the indigenous Mbuti people. In November 2011, the White Oak Conservation center and Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens hosted an international meeting of the Okapi Species Survival Plan and the Okapi European Endangered Species Programme at Jacksonville, which was attended by representatives from zoos from the US, Europe, and Japan. The aim was to discuss the management of captive okapis and arrange support for okapi conservation. Many zoos in North America and Europe currently have okapis in captivity.

===Okapis in zoos===
Around 100 okapis are in accredited Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) zoos. The okapi population is managed in America by the AZA&#x27;s Species Survival Plan, a breeding program that works to ensure genetic diversity in the captive population of endangered animals, while the EEP (European studbook) and ISB (Global studbook) are managed by Antwerp Zoo in Belgium, which was the first zoo to have an Okapi on display (in 1919), as well as one of the most successful in breeding them.

In 1937, the Bronx Zoo became the first in North America to acquire an okapi. With one of the most successful breeding programs, 13 calves have been born there between 1991 and 2011. The San Diego Zoo has exhibited okapis since 1956, and their first okapi calf was born in 1962. Since then, there have been more than 60 okapis born at the zoo and the nearby San Diego Zoo Safari Park, the most recent being Mosi, a male calf born on 21 July 2017 at the zoo. The Brookfield Zoo in Chicago has also greatly contributed to the captive population of okapis in accredited zoos. The zoo has had 28 okapi births since 1959.

Other North American zoos that exhibit and breed okapis include: Denver Zoo and Cheyenne Mountain Zoo (Colorado); Houston Zoo, Dallas Zoo, and San Antonio Zoo (Texas); Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom, White Oak Conservation, Zoo Miami, and ZooTampa at Lowry Park (Florida); Los Angeles Zoo, Sacramento Zoo, and San Diego Zoo (California); Saint Louis Zoo (Missouri); Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden and Columbus Zoo and Aquarium (Ohio); Memphis Zoo and Nashville Zoo (Tennessee); The Maryland Zoo in Baltimore (Maryland); Sedgwick County Zoo and Tanganyika Wildlife Park (Kansas); Roosevelt Park Zoo (North Dakota); Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium (Nebraska); Philadelphia Zoo (Pennsylvania); Potawatomi Zoo (Indiana); Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden (Oklahoma); Blank Park Zoo (Iowa); and Potter Park Zoo (Michigan).

In Europe, zoos that exhibit and breed okapis include: Chester Zoo, London Zoo, Marwell Zoo, The Wild Place, and Yorkshire Wildlife Park (United Kingdom); Dublin Zoo (Ireland); Berlin Zoo, Frankfurt Zoo, Wilhelma Zoo, Wuppertal Zoo, Cologne Zoo, and Leipzig Zoo (Germany); Zoo Basel (Switzerland); Copenhagen Zoo (Denmark); Rotterdam Zoo and Safaripark Beekse Bergen (Netherlands); Antwerp Zoo (Belgium); Dvůr Králové Zoo (Czech Republic); Wrocław Zoo (Poland); Bioparc Zoo de Doué and ZooParc de Beauval (France); and Lisbon Zoo (Portugal).

In Asia, three Japanese zoos exhibit okapis: Ueno Zoo in Tokyo; Kanazawa Zoo and Zoorasia in Yokohama.

<doc id="22710" wikidata="Q9631" url="?curid=22710" title="Ovary">
<text>The ovary () is a gonad in the female reproductive system that produces ova; when released, an ovum travels through the fallopian tube/oviduct into the uterus. There is an ovary on the left and the right side of the body. The ovaries are endocrine glands, secreting various hormones that play a role in the menstrual cycle and fertility. The ovary progresses through many stages beginning in the prenatal period through menopause.

==Structure==
Each ovary is whitish in color and located alongside the lateral wall of the uterus in a region called the ovarian fossa. The ovarian fossa is the region that is bounded by the external iliac artery and in front of the ureter and the internal iliac artery. This area is about 4 cm x 3 cm x 2 cm in size.

The ovaries are surrounded by a capsule, and have an outer cortex and an inner medulla. The capsule is of dense connective tissue and is known as the tunica albuginea.

Usually, ovulation occurs in one of the two ovaries releasing an egg each menstrual cycle.

The side of the ovary closest to the fallopian tube is connected to it by infundibulopelvic ligament, and the other side points downwards attached to the uterus via the ovarian ligament.

Other structures and tissues of the ovaries include the hilum.

===Ligaments===
The ovaries lie within the peritoneal cavity, on either side of the uterus, to which they are attached via a fibrous cord called the ovarian ligament. The ovaries are uncovered in the peritoneal cavity but are tethered to the body wall via the suspensory ligament of the ovary, which is a posterior extension of the broad ligament of the uterus. The part of the broad ligament of the uterus that covers the ovary is known as the mesovarium.

The ovarian pedicle is made up part of the fallopian tube, mesovarium, ovarian ligament, and ovarian blood vessels.

===Microanatomy===
The surface of the ovaries is covered with a membrane consisting of a lining of simple cuboidal-to-columnar shaped mesothelium, called the germinal epithelium.

The outer layer is the ovarian cortex, consisting of ovarian follicles and stroma in between them. Included in the follicles are the cumulus oophorus, membrana granulosa (and the granulosa cells inside it), corona radiata, zona pellucida, and primary oocyte. Theca of follicle, antrum and liquor folliculi are also contained in the follicle. Also in the cortex is the corpus luteum derived from the follicles. The innermost layer is the ovarian medulla. It can be hard to distinguish between the cortex and medulla, but follicles are usually not found in the medulla.

Follicular cells are flat epithelial cells that originate from surface epithelium covering the ovary. They are surrounded by granulosa cells that have changed from flat to cuboidal and proliferated to produce a stratified epithelium.

The ovary also contains blood vessels and lymphatics.

==Function==

At puberty, the ovary begins to secrete increasing levels of hormones. Secondary sex characteristics begin to develop in response to the hormones. The ovary changes structure and function beginning at puberty. Since the ovaries are able to regulate hormones, they also play an important role in pregnancy and fertility. When egg cells (oocytes) are released from the fallopian tube, a variety of feedback mechanisms stimulate the endocrine system, which cause hormone levels to change. These feedback mechanisms are controlled by the hypothalamus and pituitary glands. Messages or signals from the hypothalamus are sent to the pituitary gland. In turn, the pituitary gland releases hormones to the ovaries. From this signaling, the ovaries release their own hormones.

===Gamete production ===
The ovaries are the site of production and periodical release of egg cells, the female gametes. In the ovaries, the developing egg cells (or oocytes) mature in the fluid-filled follicles. Typically, only one oocyte develops at a time, but others can also mature simultaneously. Follicles are composed of different types and number of cells according to the stage of their maturation, and their size is indicative of the stage of oocyte development.

When an oocyte completes its maturation in the ovary, a surge of luteinizing hormone is secreted by the pituitary gland, which stimulates the release of the oocyte through the rupture of the follicle, a process called ovulation. The follicle remains functional and reorganizes into a corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone in order to prepare the uterus for an eventual implantation of the embryo.

===Hormone secretion===
At maturity, ovaries secrete estrogen, androgen, inhibin, and progestogen. In women before menopause, 50% of testosterone is produced by the ovaries and released directly into the blood stream. The other 50% of testosterone in the blood stream is made from conversion of the adrenal pre-androgens ( DHEA and androstenedione) to testosterone in other parts of the body. Estrogen is responsible for the appearance of secondary sex characteristics for females at puberty and for the maturation and maintenance of the reproductive organs in their mature functional state. Progesterone prepares the uterus for pregnancy, and the mammary glands for lactation. Progesterone functions with estrogen by promoting menstrual cycle changes in the endometrium.

===Ovarian aging===
As women age, they experience a decline in reproductive performance leading to menopause. This decline is tied to a decline in the number of ovarian follicles. Although about 1 million oocytes are present at birth in the human ovary, only about 500 (about 0.05%) of these ovulate, and the rest do not ovulate. The decline in ovarian reserve appears to occur at a constantly increasing rate with age, and leads to nearly complete exhaustion of the reserve by about age 52. As ovarian reserve and fertility decline with age, there is also a parallel increase in pregnancy failure and meiotic errors resulting in chromosomally abnormal conceptions. The ovarian reserve and fertility perform optimally around 20–30 years of age. Around 45 years of age, the menstrual cycle begins to change and the follicle pool decreases significantly. The events that lead to ovarian aging remain unclear. The variability of aging could include environmental factors, lifestyle habits or genetic factors.

Women with an inherited mutation in the DNA repair gene BRCA1 undergo menopause prematurely, suggesting that naturally occurring DNA damages in oocytes are repaired less efficiently in these women, and this inefficiency leads to early reproductive failure. The BRCA1 protein plays a key role in a type of DNA repair termed homologous recombinational repair that is the only known cellular process that can accurately repair DNA double-strand breaks. Titus et al. showed that DNA double-strand breaks accumulate with age in humans and mice in primordial follicles. Primordial follicles contain oocytes that are at an intermediate (prophase I) stage of meiosis. Meiosis is the general process in eukaryotic organisms by which germ cells are formed, and it is likely an adaptation for removing DNA damages, especially double-strand breaks, from germ line DNA (see Meiosis and Origin and function of meiosis). Homologous recombinational repair is especially promoted during meiosis. Titus et al. also found that expression of 4 key genes necessary for homologous recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks (BRCA1, MRE11, RAD51 and ATM) decline with age in the oocytes of humans and mice. They hypothesized that DNA double-strand break repair is vital for the maintenance of oocyte reserve and that a decline in efficiency of repair with age plays a key role in ovarian aging. A study identified 290 genetic determinants of ovarian ageing, also found that DNA damage response processes are implicated and suggests that possible effects of extending fertility in women would improve bone health, reduce risk of type 2 diabetes and increase the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers.

A variety of testing methods can be used in order to determine fertility based on maternal age. Many of these tests measure levels of hormones FSH, and GnrH. Methods such as measuring AMH (anti-Müllerian hormone) levels, and AFC (antral follicule count) can predict ovarian aging. AMH levels serve as an indicator of ovarian aging since the quality of ovarian follicles can be determined.

==Clinical significance==

Ovarian diseases can be classified as endocrine disorders or as a disorders of the reproductive system.

If the egg fails to release from the follicle in the ovary an ovarian cyst may form. Small ovarian cysts are common in healthy women. Some women have more follicles than usual (polycystic ovary syndrome), which inhibits the follicles to grow normally and this will cause cycle irregularities.

==Society and culture==

===Cryopreservation===
Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue, often called &quot;ovarian tissue cryopreservation&quot;, is of interest to women who want to preserve their reproductive function beyond the natural limit, or whose reproductive potential is threatened by cancer therapy, for example in hematologic malignancies or breast cancer. The procedure is to take a part of the ovary and carry out slow freezing before storing it in liquid nitrogen whilst therapy is undertaken. Tissue can then be thawed and implanted near the fallopian, either orthotopic (on the natural location) or heterotopic (on the abdominal wall), where it starts to produce new eggs, allowing normal conception to take place. A study of 60 procedures concluded that ovarian tissue harvesting appears to be safe. The ovarian tissue may also be transplanted into mice that are immunocompromised (SCID mice) to avoid graft rejection, and tissue can be harvested later when mature follicles have developed.

===History===
In former centuries, medical authors, for example Galen, referred to a woman&#x27;s ovaries as &quot;female testes&quot;.

==Other animals==
Birds have only one functional ovary (the left), while the other remains vestigial. In mammals including humans, the female ovary is homologous to the male testicle, in that they are both gonads and endocrine glands. Ovaries of some kind are found in the female reproductive system of many invertebrates that employ sexual reproduction. However, they develop in a very different way in most invertebrates than they do in vertebrates, and are not truly homologous.

Many of the features found in human ovaries are common to all vertebrates, including the presence of follicular cells, tunica albuginea, and so on. However, many species produce a far greater number of eggs during their lifetime than do humans, so that, in fish and amphibians, there may be hundreds, or even millions of fertile eggs present in the ovary at any given time. In these species, fresh eggs may be developing from the germinal epithelium throughout life. Corpora lutea are found only in mammals, and in some elasmobranch fish; in other species, the remnants of the follicle are quickly resorbed by the ovary. In birds, reptiles, and monotremes, the egg is relatively large, filling the follicle, and distorting the shape of the ovary at maturity.

Amphibians and reptiles have no ovarian medulla; the central part of the ovary is a hollow, lymph-filled space.

The ovary of teleosts is also often hollow, but in this case, the eggs are shed into the cavity, which opens into the oviduct. Certain nematodes of the genus &quot;Philometra&quot; are parasitic in the ovary of marine fishes and can be spectacular, with females as long as , coiled in the ovary of a fish half this length. Although most female vertebrates have two ovaries, this is not the case in all species. In most birds and in platypuses, the right ovary never matures, so that only the left is functional. (Exceptions include the kiwi and some, but not all raptors, in which both ovaries persist.) In some elasmobranchs, only the right ovary develops fully. In the primitive jawless fish, and some teleosts, there is only one ovary, formed by the fusion of the paired organs in the embryo.

<doc id="22713" wikidata="Q46452" url="?curid=22713" title="Opium">
<text>Opium (also known as poppy tears, or Lachryma papaveris) is the dried latex obtained from the seed capsules of the opium poppy &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot;. Approximately 12 percent of opium is made up of the analgesic alkaloid morphine, which is processed chemically to produce heroin and other synthetic opioids for medicinal use and for the illegal drug trade. The latex also contains the closely related opiates codeine and thebaine, and non-analgesic alkaloids such as papaverine and noscapine. The traditional, labor-intensive method of obtaining the latex is to scratch (&quot;score&quot;) the immature seed pods (fruits) by hand; the latex leaks out and dries to a sticky yellowish residue that is later scraped off and dehydrated.

The English word for opium is borrowed from Latin, which in turn comes from (&quot;ópion&quot;), a diminutive of ὀπός (&quot;opós&quot;, &quot;juice of a plant&quot;). The word &quot;meconium&quot; (derived from the Greek for &quot;opium-like&quot;, but now used to refer to newborn stools) historically referred to related, weaker preparations made from other parts of the opium poppy or different species of poppies.

The production methods have not significantly changed since ancient times. Through selective breeding of the &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot; plant, the content of the phenanthrene alkaloids morphine, codeine, and to a lesser extent thebaine has been greatly increased. In modern times, much of the thebaine, which often serves as the raw material for the synthesis for oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and other semisynthetic opiates, originates from extracting &quot;Papaver orientale&quot; or &quot;Papaver bracteatum&quot;.

For the illegal drug trade, the morphine is extracted from the opium latex, reducing the bulk weight by 88%. It is then converted to heroin which is almost twice as potent, and increases the value by a similar factor. The reduced weight and bulk make it easier to smuggle.

== History ==
The Mediterranean region contains the earliest archeological evidence of human use; the oldest known seeds date back to more than 5000BCE in the Neolithic age with purposes such as food, anaesthetics, and ritual. Evidence from ancient Greece indicates that opium was consumed in several ways, including inhalation of vapors, suppositories, medical poultices, and as a combination with hemlock for suicide. Opium is mentioned in the most important medical texts of the ancient and medieval world, including the Ebers Papyrus and the writings of Dioscorides, Galen, and Avicenna. Widespread medical use of unprocessed opium continued through the American Civil War before giving way to morphine and its successors, which could be injected at a precisely controlled dosage.

=== Ancient use (pre-500 CE) ===

Opium has been actively collected since approximately 3400BCE.

At least 17 finds of &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot; from Neolithic settlements have been reported throughout Switzerland, Germany, and Spain, including the placement of large numbers of poppy seed capsules at a burial site (the &quot;Cueva de los Murciélagos&quot;, or &quot;Bat Cave&quot;, in Spain), which has been carbon-14 dated to 4200BCE. Numerous finds of &quot;P. somniferum&quot; or &quot;P. setigerum&quot; from Bronze Age and Iron Age settlements have also been reported. The first known cultivation of opium poppies was in Mesopotamia, approximately 3400BCE, by Sumerians, who called the plant &quot;hul gil&quot;, the &quot;joy plant&quot;. Tablets found at Nippur, a Sumerian spiritual center south of Baghdad, described the collection of poppy juice in the morning and its use in production of opium. Cultivation continued in the Middle East by the Assyrians, who also collected poppy juice in the morning after scoring the pods with an iron scoop; they called the juice &quot;aratpa-pal&quot;, possibly the root of &quot;Papaver&quot;. Opium production continued under the Babylonians and Egyptians.

Opium was used with poison hemlock to put people quickly and painlessly to death. It was also used in medicine. &quot;Spongia somnifera&quot;, sponges soaked in opium, were used during surgery. The Egyptians cultivated &quot;opium thebaicum&quot; in famous poppy fields around 1300BCE. Opium was traded from Egypt by the Phoenicians and Minoans to destinations around the Mediterranean Sea, including Greece, Carthage, and Europe. By 1100BCE, opium was cultivated on Cyprus, where surgical-quality knives were used to score the poppy pods, and opium was cultivated, traded, and smoked. Opium was also mentioned after the Persian conquest of Assyria and Babylonian lands in the .

From the earliest finds, opium has appeared to have ritual significance, and anthropologists have speculated ancient priests may have used the drug as a proof of healing power. In Egypt, the use of opium was generally restricted to priests, magicians, and warriors, its invention is credited to Thoth, and it was said to have been given by Isis to Ra as treatment for a headache. A figure of the Minoan &quot;goddess of the narcotics&quot;, wearing a crown of three opium poppies, BCE, was recovered from the Sanctuary of Gazi, Crete, together with a simple smoking apparatus.

The Greek gods Hypnos (Sleep), Nyx (Night), and Thanatos (Death) were depicted wreathed in poppies or holding them. Poppies also frequently adorned statues of Apollo, Asclepius, Pluto, Demeter, Aphrodite, Kybele and Isis, symbolizing nocturnal oblivion.

=== Islamic societies (500–1500 CE) ===

As the power of the Roman Empire declined, the lands to the south and east of the Mediterranean Sea became incorporated into the Islamic Empires. Some Muslims believe &quot;hadiths&quot;, such as in &quot;Sahih Bukhari&quot;, prohibit every intoxicating substance, though the use of intoxicants in medicine has been widely permitted by scholars. Dioscorides&#x27; five-volume &quot;De Materia Medica&quot;, the precursor of pharmacopoeias, remained in use (which was edited and improved in the Arabic versions) from the 1st to 16th centuries, and described opium and the wide range of its uses prevalent in the ancient world.
Between 400 and 1200 AD, Arab traders introduced opium to China, and to India by 700 AD. The physician Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi of Persian origin (&quot;Rhazes&quot;, 845–930 CE) maintained a laboratory and school in Baghdad, and was a student and critic of Galen; he made use of opium in anesthesia and recommended its use for the treatment of melancholy in &quot;Fi ma-la-yahdara al-tabib&quot;, &quot;In the Absence of a Physician&quot;, a home medical manual directed toward ordinary citizens for self-treatment if a doctor was not available.

The renowned Andalusian ophthalmologic surgeon Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (&quot;Abulcasis&quot;, 936–1013 CE) relied on opium and mandrake as surgical anesthetics and wrote a treatise, &quot;al-Tasrif&quot;, that influenced medical thought well into the 16th century.

The Persian physician Abū &#x27;Alī al-Husayn ibn Sina (&quot;Avicenna&quot;) described opium as the most powerful of the stupefacients, in comparison to mandrake and other highly effective herbs, in &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot;. The text lists medicinal effects of opium, such as analgesia, hypnosis, antitussive effects, gastrointestinal effects, cognitive effects, respiratory depression, neuromuscular disturbances, and sexual dysfunction. It also refers to opium&#x27;s potential as a poison. Avicenna describes several methods of delivery and recommendations for doses of the drug. This classic text was translated into Latin in 1175 and later into many other languages and remained authoritative until the 19th century. Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu used opium in the 14th-century Ottoman Empire to treat migraine headaches, sciatica, and other painful ailments.

=== Reintroduction to Western medicine ===

Manuscripts of Pseudo-Apuleius&#x27;s 5th-century work from the 10th and 11th centuries refer to the use of wild poppy &quot;Papaver agreste&quot; or &quot;Papaver rhoeas&quot; (identified as &quot;P. silvaticum&quot;) instead of &quot;P. somniferum&quot; for inducing sleep and relieving pain.

The use of Paracelsus&#x27; laudanum was introduced to Western medicine in 1527, when Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, better known by the name Paracelsus, claimed (dubiously) to have returned from wanderings in Arabia with a famous sword, within the pommel of which he kept &quot;Stones of Immortality&quot; compounded from opium thebaicum, citrus juice, and &quot;quintessence of gold&quot;. The name &quot;Paracelsus&quot; was a pseudonym signifying him the equal or better of Aulus Cornelius Celsus, whose text, which described the use of opium or a similar preparation, had recently been translated and reintroduced to medieval Europe. &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot;, the standard medical textbook that Paracelsus burned in a public bonfire three weeks after being appointed professor at the University of Basel, also described the use of opium, though many Latin translations were of poor quality. &quot;Laudanum&quot; was originally the 16th-century term for a medicine associated with a particular physician that was widely well-regarded, but became standardized as &quot;tincture of opium&quot;, a solution of opium in ethanol, which Paracelsus has been credited with developing. During his lifetime, Paracelsus was viewed as an adventurer who challenged the theories and mercenary motives of contemporary medicine with dangerous chemical therapies, but his therapies marked a turning point in Western medicine. In the 1660s, laudanum was recommended for pain, sleeplessness, and diarrhea by Thomas Sydenham, the renowned &quot;father of English medicine&quot; or &quot;English Hippocrates&quot;, to whom is attributed the quote, &quot;Among the remedies which it has pleased Almighty God to give to man to relieve his sufferings, none is so universal and so efficacious as opium.&quot; Use of opium as a cure-all was reflected in the formulation of mithridatium described in the 1728 &quot;Chambers Cyclopedia&quot;, which included true opium in the mixture.

Eventually, laudanum became readily available and extensively used by the 18th century in Europe, especially England. Compared to other chemicals available to 18th century regular physicians, opium was a benign alternative to arsenic, mercury, or emetics, and it was remarkably successful in alleviating a wide range of ailments. Due to the constipation often produced by the consumption of opium, it was one of the most effective treatments for cholera, dysentery, and diarrhea. As a cough suppressant, opium was used to treat bronchitis, tuberculosis, and other respiratory illnesses. Opium was additionally prescribed for rheumatism and insomnia. Medical textbooks even recommended its use by people in good health, to &quot;optimize the internal equilibrium of the human body&quot;.

During the 18th century, opium was found to be a good remedy for nervous disorders. Due to its sedative and tranquilizing properties, it was used to quiet the minds of those with psychosis, help with people who were considered insane, and also to help treat patients with insomnia. However, despite its medicinal values in these cases, it was noted that in cases of psychosis, it could cause anger or depression, and due to the drug&#x27;s euphoric effects, it could cause depressed patients to become more depressed after the effects wore off because they would get used to being high.

The standard medical use of opium persisted well into the 19th century. US president William Henry Harrison was treated with opium in 1841, and in the American Civil War, the Union Army used 175,000 lb (80,000 kg) of opium tincture and powder and about 500,000 opium pills. During this time of popularity, users called opium &quot;God&#x27;s Own Medicine&quot;.

One reason for the increase in opiate consumption in the United States during the 19th century was the prescribing and dispensing of legal opiates by physicians and pharmacists to women with &quot;female complaints&quot; (mostly to relieve menstrual pain and hysteria). Because opiates were viewed as more humane than punishment or restraint, they were often used to treat the mentally ill. Between 150,000 and 200,000 opiate addicts lived in the United States in the late 19th century and between two-thirds and three-quarters of these addicts were women.

Opium addiction in the later 19th century received a hereditary definition. Dr. George Beard in 1869 proposed his theory of neurasthenia, a hereditary nervous system deficiency that could predispose an individual to addiction. Neurasthenia was increasingly tied in medical rhetoric to the &quot;nervous exhaustion&quot; suffered by many a white-collar worker in the increasingly hectic and industrialized U.S. life—the most likely potential clients of physicians.

=== Recreational use in Europe, the Middle East and the US (11th to 19th centuries) ===

Soldiers returning home from the Crusades in the 11th to 13th century brought opium with them. Opium is said to have been used for recreational purposes from the 14th century onwards in Muslim societies. Ottoman and European testimonies confirm that from the 16th to the 19th centuries Anatolian opium was eaten in Constantinople as much as it was exported to Europe. In 1573, for instance, a Venetian visitor to the Ottoman Empire observed many of the Turkish natives of Constantinople regularly drank a &quot;certain black water made with opium&quot; that makes them feel good, but to which they become so addicted, if they try to go without, they will &quot;quickly die&quot;. From drinking it, dervishes claimed the drugs bestowed them with visionary glimpses of future happiness. Indeed, the Ottoman Empire supplied the West with opium long before China and India.

Extensive textual and pictorial sources also show that poppy cultivation and opium consumption were widespread in Safavid Iran and Mughal India.

==== England ====
In England, opium fulfilled a &quot;critical&quot; role, as it did other societies, in addressing multifactorial pain, cough, dysentery, diarrhea, as argued by Virginia Berridge. A medical panacea of the 19th century, &quot;any respectable person&quot; could purchase a range of hashish pastes and (later) morphine with complementary injection kit.

Thomas De Quincey&#x27;s &quot;Confessions of an English Opium-Eater&quot; (1822), one of the first and most famous literary accounts of opium addiction written from the point of view of an addict, details the pleasures and dangers of the drug. In the book, it is not Ottoman, nor Chinese, addicts about whom he writes, but English opium users: &quot;I question whether any Turk, of all that ever entered the paradise of opium-eaters, can have had half the pleasure I had.&quot; De Quincey writes about the great English Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834), whose &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; is also widely considered to be a poem of the opium experience. Coleridge began using opium in 1791 after developing jaundice and rheumatic fever, and became a full addict after a severe attack of the disease in 1801, requiring 80–100 drops of laudanum daily.

===China===
==== Recreational use in China ====
The earliest clear description of the use of opium as a recreational drug in China came from Xu Boling, who wrote in 1483 that opium was &quot;mainly used to aid masculinity, strengthen sperm and regain vigor&quot;, and that it &quot;enhances the art of alchemists, sex and court ladies&quot;. He also described an expedition sent by the Ming dynasty Chenghua Emperor in 1483 to procure opium for a price &quot;equal to that of gold&quot; in Hainan, Fujian, Zhejiang, Sichuan and Shaanxi, where it is close to the western lands of Xiyu. A century later, Li Shizhen listed standard medical uses of opium in his renowned &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; (1578), but also wrote that &quot;lay people use it for the art of sex,&quot; in particular the ability to &quot;arrest seminal emission&quot;. This association of opium with sex continued in China until the end of the 19th century.

Opium smoking began as a privilege of the elite and remained a great luxury into the early 19th century. However, by 1861, Wang Tao wrote that opium was used even by rich peasants, and even a small village without a rice store would have a shop where opium was sold.

Recreational use of opium was part of a civilized and mannered ritual, akin to an East Asian tea ceremony, prior to the extensive prohibitions that came later. In places of gathering, often tea shops, or a person&#x27;s home servings of opium were offered as a form of greeting and politeness. Often served with tea (in China) and with specific and fine utensils and beautifully carved wooden pipes. The wealthier the smoker, the finer and more expensive material used in ceremony. The image of seedy underground, destitute smokers were often generated by anti-opium narratives and became a more accurate image of opium use following the effects of large scale opium prohibition in the 1880s.

==== Prohibitions in China ====
Opium prohibition in China began in 1729, yet was followed by nearly two centuries of increasing opium use. A massive destruction of opium by an emissary of the Chinese Daoguang Emperor in an attempt to stop opium smuggling by the British led to the First Opium War (18391842), in which Britain defeated China. After 1860, opium use continued to increase with widespread domestic production in China. By 1905, an estimated 25 percent of the male population were regular consumers of the drug. Recreational use of opium elsewhere in the world remained rare into late in the 19th century, as indicated by ambivalent reports of opium usage. In 1906, 41,000 tons were produced, but because 39,000 tons of that year&#x27;s opium were consumed in China, overall usage in the rest of the world was much lower. These figures from 1906 have been criticized as overestimates.
Smoking of opium came on the heels of tobacco smoking and may have been encouraged by a brief ban on the smoking of tobacco by the Ming emperor. The prohibition ended in 1644 with the coming of the Qing dynasty, which encouraged smokers to mix in increasing amounts of opium. In 1705, Wang Shizhen wrote, &quot;nowadays, from nobility and gentlemen down to slaves and women, all are addicted to tobacco.&quot; Tobacco in that time was frequently mixed with other herbs (this continues with clove cigarettes to the modern day), and opium was one component in the mixture. Tobacco mixed with opium was called &quot;madak&quot; (or &quot;madat&quot;) and became popular throughout China and its seafaring trade partners (such as Taiwan, Java, and the Philippines) in the 17th century. In 1712, Engelbert Kaempfer described addiction to &quot;madak&quot;: &quot;No commodity throughout the Indies is retailed with greater profit by the Batavians than opium, which [its] users cannot do without, nor can they come by it except it be brought by the ships of the Batavians from Bengal and Coromandel.&quot;

Fueled in part by the 1729 ban on &quot;madak&quot;, which at first effectively exempted pure opium as a potentially medicinal product, the smoking of pure opium became more popular in the 18th century. In 1736, the smoking of pure opium was described by Huang Shujing, involving a pipe made from bamboo rimmed with silver, stuffed with palm slices and hair, fed by a clay bowl in which a globule of molten opium was held over the flame of an oil lamp. This elaborate procedure, requiring the maintenance of pots of opium at just the right temperature for a globule to be scooped up with a needle-like skewer for smoking, formed the basis of a craft of &quot;paste-scooping&quot; by which servant girls could become prostitutes as the opportunity arose.

==== Chinese diaspora in the West ====
The Chinese Diaspora in the West (1800s to 1949) first began to flourish during the 19th century due to famine and political upheaval, as well as rumors of wealth to be had outside of Southeast Asia. Chinese emigrants to cities such as San Francisco, London, and New York City brought with them the Chinese manner of opium smoking, and the social traditions of the opium den. The Indian Diaspora distributed opium-eaters in the same way, and both social groups survived as &quot;lascars&quot; (seamen) and &quot;coolies&quot; (manual laborers). French sailors provided another major group of opium smokers, having gotten the habit while in French Indochina, where the drug was promoted and monopolized by the colonial government as a source of revenue. Among white Europeans, opium was more frequently consumed as laudanum or in patent medicines. Britain&#x27;s All-India Opium Act of 1878 formalized ethnic restrictions on the use of opium, limiting recreational opium sales to registered Indian opium-eaters and Chinese opium-smokers only and prohibiting its sale to workers from Burma. Likewise, in San Francisco, Chinese immigrants were permitted to smoke opium, so long as they refrained from doing so in the presence of whites.

Because of the low social status of immigrant workers, contemporary writers and media had little trouble portraying opium dens as seats of vice, white slavery, gambling, knife- and revolver-fights, and a source for drugs causing deadly overdoses, with the potential to addict and corrupt the white population. By 1919, anti-Chinese riots attacked Limehouse, the Chinatown of London. Chinese men were deported for playing keno and sentenced to hard labor for opium possession. Due to this, both the immigrant population and the social use of opium fell into decline. Yet despite lurid literary accounts to the contrary, 19th-century London was not a hotbed of opium smoking. The total lack of photographic evidence of opium smoking in Britain, as opposed to the relative abundance of historical photos depicting opium smoking in North America and France, indicates the infamous Limehouse opium-smoking scene was little more than fantasy on the part of British writers of the day, who were intent on scandalizing their readers while drumming up the threat of the &quot;yellow peril&quot;.

==== Prohibition and conflict in China ====

A large scale opium prohibition attempt began in 1729, when the Qing Yongzheng Emperor, disturbed by &quot;madak&quot; smoking at court and carrying out the government&#x27;s role of upholding Confucian virtues, officially prohibited the sale of opium, except for a small amount for medicinal purposes. The ban punished sellers and opium den keepers, but not users of the drug. Opium was banned completely in 1799, and this prohibition continued until 1860.

During the Qing dynasty, China opened itself to foreign trade under the Canton System through the port of Guangzhou (Canton), with traders from the East India Company visiting the port by the 1690s. Due to the growing British demand for Chinese tea and the Chinese Emperor&#x27;s lack of interest in British commodities other than silver, British traders resorted to trade in opium as a high-value commodity for which China was not self-sufficient. The English traders had been purchasing small amounts of opium from India for trade since Ralph Fitch first visited in the mid-16th century. Trade in opium was standardized, with production of balls of raw opium, , 30% water content, wrapped in poppy leaves and petals, and shipped in chests of (one picul). Chests of opium were sold in auctions in Calcutta with the understanding that the independent purchasers would then smuggle it into China.

China had a positive balance sheet in trading with the British, which led to a decrease of the British silver stocks. Therefore, the British tried to encourage Chinese opium use to enhance their balance, and they delivered it from Indian provinces under British control. In India, its cultivation, as well as the manufacture and traffic to China, were subject to the British East India Company (BEIC), as a strict monopoly of the British government. There was an extensive and complicated system of BEIC agencies involved in the supervision and management of opium production and distribution in India. Bengal opium was highly prized, commanding twice the price of the domestic Chinese product, which was regarded as inferior in quality.
Some competition came from the newly independent United States, which began to compete in Guangzhou, selling Turkish opium in the 1820s. Portuguese traders also brought opium from the independent Malwa states of western India, although by 1820, the British were able to restrict this trade by charging &quot;pass duty&quot; on the opium when it was forced to pass through Bombay to reach an &quot;entrepot&quot;.
Despite drastic penalties and continued prohibition of opium until 1860, opium smuggling rose steadily from 200 chests per year under the Yongzheng Emperor to 1,000 under the Qianlong Emperor, 4,000 under the Jiaqing Emperor, and 30,000 under the Daoguang Emperor. This illegal sale of opium, which has been called &quot;the most long continued and systematic international crime of modern times&quot;, became one of the world&#x27;s most valuable single commodity trades, and between 1814 and 1850, sucked out 11 percent of China&#x27;s money supply.

In response to the ever-growing number of Chinese people becoming addicted to opium, the Qing Daoguang Emperor took strong action to halt the smuggling of opium, including the seizure of cargo. In 1838, the Chinese Commissioner Lin Zexu destroyed 20,000 chests of opium (approximately 2,660,000 pounds) in Guangzhou in a river. Given that a chest of opium was worth nearly in 1800, this was a substantial economic loss. The British queen Victoria, not willing to replace the cheap opium with costly silver, began the First Opium War in 1840, the British winning Hong Kong and trade concessions in the first of a series of Unequal Treaties.

The opium trade incurred intense enmity from the later British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone. As a member of Parliament, Gladstone called it &quot;most infamous and atrocious&quot; referring to the opium trade between China and British India in particular. Gladstone was fiercely against both of the Opium Wars Britain waged in China in the First Opium War initiated in 1840 and the Second Opium War initiated in 1857, denounced British violence against Chinese, and was ardently opposed to the British trade in opium to China. Gladstone lambasted it as &quot;Palmerston&#x27;s Opium War&quot; and said that he felt &quot;in dread of the judgments of God upon England for our national iniquity towards China&quot; in May 1840. A famous speech was made by Gladstone in Parliament against the First Opium War. Gladstone criticized it as &quot;a war more unjust in its origin, a war more calculated in its progress to cover this country with permanent disgrace&quot;. His hostility to opium stemmed from the effects of opium brought upon his sister Helen. Due to the First Opium war brought on by Palmerston, there was initial reluctance to join the government of Peel on part of Gladstone before 1841.
Following China&#x27;s defeat in the Second Opium War in 1858, China was forced to legalize opium and began massive domestic production. Importation of opium peaked in 1879 at 6,700 tons, and by 1906, China was producing 85 percent of the world&#x27;s opium, some 35,000 tons, and 27 percent of its adult male population regularly used opium13.5million people consuming 39,000 tons of opium yearly. From 1880 to the beginning of the Communist era, the British attempted to discourage the use of opium in China, but this effectively promoted the use of morphine, heroin, and cocaine, further exacerbating the problem of addiction.
Scientific evidence of the pernicious nature of opium use was largely undocumented in the 1890s, when Protestant missionaries in China decided to strengthen their opposition to the trade by compiling data which would demonstrate the harm the drug did. Faced with the problem that many Chinese associated Christianity with opium, partly due to the arrival of early Protestant missionaries on opium clippers, at the 1890 Shanghai Missionary Conference, they agreed to establish the Permanent Committee for the Promotion of Anti-Opium Societies in an attempt to overcome this problem and to arouse public opinion against the opium trade. The members of the committee were John Glasgow Kerr, MD, American Presbyterian Mission in Guangzhou (Canton); B.C. Atterbury, MD, American Presbyterian Mission in Beijing (Peking); Archdeacon Arthur E. Moule, Church Missionary Society in Shanghai; Henry Whitney, MD, American Board of Commissioners for foreign Missions in Fuzhou; the Rev. Samuel Clarke, China Inland Mission in Guiyang; the Rev. Arthur Gostick Shorrock, English Baptist Mission in Taiyuan; and the Rev. Griffith John, London Mission Society in Hankou. These missionaries were generally outraged over the British government&#x27;s Royal Commission on Opium visiting India but not China. Accordingly, the missionaries first organized the Anti-Opium League in China among their colleagues in every mission station in China. American missionary Hampden Coit DuBose acted as first president. This organization, which had elected national officers and held an annual national meeting, was instrumental in gathering data from every Western-trained medical doctor in China, which was then published as William Hector Park compiled &quot;Opinions of Over 100 Physicians on the Use of Opium in China&quot; (Shanghai: American Presbyterian Mission Press, 1899). The vast majority of these medical doctors were missionaries; the survey also included doctors who were in private practices, particularly in Shanghai and Hong Kong, as well as Chinese who had been trained in medical schools in Western countries. In England, the home director of the China Inland Mission, Benjamin Broomhall, was an active opponent of the opium trade, writing two books to promote the banning of opium smoking: &quot;The Truth about Opium Smoking&quot; and &quot;The Chinese Opium Smoker&quot;. In 1888, Broomhall formed and became secretary of the Christian Union for the Severance of the British Empire with the Opium Traffic and editor of its periodical, &quot;National Righteousness&quot;. He lobbied the British Parliament to stop the opium trade. He and James Laidlaw Maxwell appealed to the London Missionary Conference of 1888 and the Edinburgh Missionary Conference of 1910 to condemn the continuation of the trade. When Broomhall was dying, his son Marshall read to him from &quot;The Times&quot; the welcome news that an agreement had been signed ensuring the end of the opium trade within two years.

Official Chinese resistance to opium was renewed on September 20, 1906, with an antiopium initiative intended to eliminate the drug problem within 10 years. The program relied on the turning of public sentiment against opium, with mass meetings at which opium paraphernalia were publicly burned, as well as coercive legal action and the granting of police powers to organizations such as the Fujian Anti-Opium Society. Smokers were required to register for licenses for gradually reducing rations of the drug. Action against opium farmers centered upon a highly repressive incarnation of law enforcement in which rural populations had their property destroyed, their land confiscated and/or were publicly tortured, humiliated and executed. Addicts sometimes turned to missionaries for treatment for their addiction, though many associated these foreigners with the drug trade. The program was counted as a substantial success, with a cessation of direct British opium exports to China (but not Hong Kong) and most provinces declared free of opium production. Nonetheless, the success of the program was only temporary, with opium use rapidly increasing during the disorder following the death of Yuan Shikai in 1916. Opium farming also increased, peaking in 1930 when the League of Nations singled China out as the primary source of illicit opium in East and Southeast Asia. Many local powerholders facilitated the trade during this period to finance conflicts over territory and political campaigns. In some areas food crops were eradicated to make way for opium, contributing to famines in Guizhou and Shaanxi Provinces between 1921 and 1923, and food deficits in other provinces.

Beginning in 1915, Chinese nationalist groups came to describe the period of military losses and Unequal Treaties as the &quot;Century of National Humiliation&quot;, later defined to end with the conclusion of the Chinese Civil War in 1949.

In the northern provinces of Ningxia and Suiyuan in China, Chinese Muslim General Ma Fuxiang both prohibited and engaged in the opium trade. It was hoped that Ma Fuxiang would have improved the situation, since Chinese Muslims were well known for opposition to smoking opium. Ma Fuxiang officially prohibited opium and made it illegal in Ningxia, but the Guominjun reversed his policy; by 1933, people from every level of society were abusing the drug, and Ningxia was left in destitution. In 1923, an officer of the Bank of China from Baotou found out that Ma Fuxiang was assisting the drug trade in opium which helped finance his military expenses. He earned from taxing those sales in 1923. General Ma had been using the bank, a branch of the Government of China&#x27;s exchequer, to arrange for silver currency to be transported to Baotou to use it to sponsor the trade.

The opium trade under the Chinese Communist Party was important to its finances in the 1940s. Peter Vladimirov&#x27;s diary provided a first hand account. Chen Yung-fa provided a detailed historical account of how the opium trade was essential to the economy of Yan&#x27;an during this period. Mitsubishi and Mitsui were involved in the opium trade during the Japanese occupation of China.

Mao Zedong government is generally credited with eradicating both consumption and production of opium during the 1950s using unrestrained repression and social reform. Ten million addicts were forced into compulsory treatment, dealers were executed, and opium-producing regions were planted with new crops. Remaining opium production shifted south of the Chinese border into the Golden Triangle region. The remnant opium trade primarily served Southeast Asia, but spread to American soldiers during the Vietnam War; based on a study of opiate use in soldiers returning to the United States in 1971, 20 percent of participants were dependent enough to experience withdrawal symptoms.

=== Prohibition outside China ===
There were no legal restrictions on the importation or use of opium in the United States until the San Francisco Opium Den Ordinance, which banned dens for public smoking of opium in 1875, a measure fueled by anti-Chinese sentiment and the perception that whites were starting to frequent the dens. This was followed by an 1891 California law requiring that narcotics carry warning labels and that their sales be recorded in a registry; amendments to the California Pharmacy and Poison Act in 1907 made it a crime to sell opiates without a prescription, and bans on possession of opium or opium pipes in 1909 were enacted.

At the US federal level, the legal actions taken reflected constitutional restrictions under the enumerated powers doctrine prior to reinterpretation of the commerce clause, which did not allow the federal government to enact arbitrary prohibitions, but did permit arbitrary taxation. Beginning in 1883, opium importation was taxed at to per pound, until the Opium Exclusion Act of 1909 prohibited the importation of opium altogether. In a similar manner, the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914, passed in fulfillment of the International Opium Convention of 1912, nominally placed a tax on the distribution of opiates, but served as a &quot;de facto&quot; prohibition of the drugs. Today, opium is regulated by the Drug Enforcement Administration under the Controlled Substances Act.

Following passage of a Colonial Australian law in 1895, Queensland&#x27;s Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897 addressed opium addiction among Aboriginal people, though it soon became a general vehicle for depriving them of basic rights by administrative regulation. By 1905 all Australian states and territories had passed similar laws making prohibitions to Opium sale. Smoking and possession was prohibited in 1908.

Hardening of Canadian attitudes toward Chinese opium users and fear of a spread of the drug into the white population led to the effective criminalization of opium for nonmedical use in Canada between 1908 and the mid-1920s.

In 1909, the International Opium Commission was founded, and by 1914, 34 nations had agreed that the production and importation of opium should be diminished. In 1924, 62 nations participated in a meeting of the commission. Subsequently, this role passed to the League of Nations, and all signatory nations agreed to prohibit the import, sale, distribution, export, and use of all narcotic drugs, except for medical and scientific purposes. This role was later taken up by the International Narcotics Control Board of the United Nations under of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, and subsequently under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Opium-producing nations are required to designate a government agency to take physical possession of licit opium crops as soon as possible after harvest and conduct all wholesaling and exporting through that agency.

===Indochina tax===

From 1897 to 1902, Paul Doumer (later President of France) was Governor-General of French Indochina. Upon his arrival the colonies were losing millions of francs each year. Determined to put them on a paying basis he levied taxes on various products, opium among them. The Vietnamese, Cambodians and Laotians who could or would not pay these taxes, lost their houses and land, and often became day laborers. Evidently, resorting to this means of gaining income gave France a vested interest in the continuation of opium use among the population of Indochina.

=== Regulation in Britain and the United States ===
Before the 1920s, regulation in Britain was controlled by pharmacists. Pharmacists who were found to have prescribed opium for illegitimate uses and anyone found to have sold opium without proper qualifications would be prosecuted. With the passing of the Rolleston Act in Britain in 1926, doctors were allowed to prescribe opiates such as morphine and heroin if they believed their patients demonstrated a medical need. Because addiction was viewed as a medical problem rather than an indulgence, doctors were permitted to allow patients to wean themselves off opiates rather than cutting off any opiate use altogether. The passing of the Rolleston Act put the control of opium use in the hands of medical doctors instead of pharmacists. Later in the 20th century, addiction to opiates, especially heroin in young people, continued to rise and so the sale and prescription of opiates was limited to doctors in treatment centres. If these doctors were found to be prescribing opiates without just cause, then they could lose their licence to practice or prescribe drugs.

Abuse of opium in the United States began in the late 19th century and was largely associated with Chinese immigrants. During this time the use of opium had little stigma; the drug was used freely until 1882 when a law was passed to confine opium smoking to specific dens. Until the full ban on opium-based products came into effect just after the beginning of the twentieth century, physicians in the US considered opium a miracle drug that could help with many ailments. Therefore, the ban on said products was more a result of negative connotations towards its use and distribution by Chinese immigrants who were heavily persecuted during this particular period in history. As the 19th century progressed however, doctor Hamilton Wright worked to decrease the use of opium in the US by submitting the Harrison Act to congress. This act put taxes and restrictions on the sale and prescription of opium, as well as trying to stigmatize the opium poppy and its derivatives as &quot;demon drugs&quot;, to try to scare people away from them. This act and the stigma of a demon drug on opium, led to the criminalization of people that used opium-based products. It made the use and possession of opium and any of its derivatives illegal. The restrictions were recently redefined by the Federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970.

===20th-century use===
Opium production in China and the rest of East Asia was nearly wiped out after WWII, however, sustained covert support by the United States Central Intelligence Agency for the Thai Northern Army and the Chinese Nationalist Kuomintang army invading Burma facilitated production and trafficking of the drug from Southeast Asia for decades, with the region becoming a major source of world supplies.

During the Communist era in Eastern Europe, poppy stalks sold in bundles by farmers were processed by users with household chemicals to make &quot;kompot&quot; (&quot;Polish heroin&quot;), and poppy seeds were used to produce &quot;koknar&quot;, an opiate.

=== Obsolescence ===

Globally, opium has gradually been superseded by a variety of purified, semi-synthetic, and synthetic opioids with progressively stronger effects, and by other general anesthetics. This process began in 1804, when Friedrich Wilhelm Adam Sertürner first isolated morphine from the opium poppy.
The process continued until 1817, when Sertürner published his results after thirteen years of research and a nearly disastrous trial on himself and three boys. The great advantage of purified morphine was that a patient could be treated with a known dose—whereas with raw plant material, as Gabriel Fallopius once lamented, &quot;if soporifics are weak they do not help; if they are strong they are exceedingly dangerous.&quot;

Morphine was the first pharmaceutical isolated from a natural product, and this success encouraged the isolation of other alkaloids: by 1820, isolations of noscapine, strychnine, veratrine, colchicine, caffeine, and quinine were reported. Morphine sales began in 1827, by Heinrich Emanuel Merck of Darmstadt, and helped him expand his family pharmacy into the Merck KGaA pharmaceutical company. Codeine was isolated in 1832 by Pierre Jean Robiquet.

The use of diethyl ether and chloroform for general anesthesia began in 1846–1847, and rapidly displaced the use of opiates and tropane alkaloids from Solanaceae due to their relative safety.

Heroin, the first semi-synthetic opioid, was first synthesized in 1874, but was not pursued until its rediscovery in 1897 by Felix Hoffmann at the Bayer pharmaceutical company in Elberfeld, Germany. From 1898 to 1910 heroin was marketed as a non-addictive morphine substitute and cough medicine for children. Because the lethal dose of heroin was viewed as a hundred times greater than its effective dose, heroin was advertised as a safer alternative to other opioids. By 1902, sales made up 5 percent of the company&#x27;s profits, and &quot;heroinism&quot; had attracted media attention. Oxycodone, a thebaine derivative similar to codeine, was introduced by Bayer in 1916 and promoted as a less-addictive analgesic. Preparations of the drug such as oxycodone with paracetamol and extended release oxycodone remain popular to this day.

A range of synthetic opioids such as methadone (1937), pethidine (1939), fentanyl (late 1950s), and derivatives thereof have been introduced, and each is preferred for certain specialized applications. Nonetheless, morphine remains the drug of choice for American combat medics, who carry packs of syrettes containing 16 milligrams each for use on severely wounded soldiers. No drug has been found that can match the painkilling effect of opioids without also duplicating much of their addictive potential.

== Modern production and use ==
Opium was prohibited in many countries during the early 20th century, leading to the modern pattern of opium production as a precursor for illegal recreational drugs or tightly regulated, highly taxed, legal prescription drugs. In 1980, 2,000 tons of opium supplied all legal and illegal uses. Worldwide production in 2006 was 6610 tonnes—about one-fifth the level of production in 1906; since then, opium production has fallen.

In 2002, the price for one kilogram of opium was for the farmer, for purchasers in Afghanistan, and on the streets of Europe before conversion into heroin.

Opium production increased considerably, surpassing 5,000 tons in 2002 and reaching 8,600 tons in Afghanistan and 840 tons in the Golden Triangle in 2014. The World Health Organization has estimated that current production of opium would need to increase fivefold to account for total global medical need. Solar energy panels in use in Afghanistan have allowed farmers to dig their wells deeper, leading to a bumper crop of opium year after year. In a 2023 report, poppy cultivation in southern Afghanistan was reduced by over 80% as a result of Taliban campaigns to stop its use toward opium. This included a 99% reduction of opium growth in the Helmand Province. In November 2023, a U.N report showed that in the entirety of Afghanistan, poppy cultivation dropped by over 95%, removing it from its place as being the world&#x27;s largest opium producer.

=== &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot; ===

Opium poppies are popular and attractive garden plants, whose flowers vary greatly in color, size and form. A modest amount of domestic cultivation in private gardens is not usually subject to legal controls. In part, this tolerance reflects variation in addictive potency. A cultivar for opium production, &quot;Papaver somniferum L. elite&quot;, contains 91.2 percent morphine, codeine, and thebaine in its latex alkaloids, whereas in the latex of the condiment cultivar &quot;Marianne&quot;, these three alkaloids total only 14.0 percent. The remaining alkaloids in the latter cultivar are primarily narcotoline and noscapine.

Seed capsules can be dried and used for decorations, but they also contain morphine, codeine, and other alkaloids. These pods can be boiled in water to produce a bitter tea that induces a long-lasting intoxication. If allowed to mature, poppy pods (poppy straw) can be crushed and used to produce lower quantities of morphinans. In poppies subjected to mutagenesis and selection on a mass scale, researchers have been able to use poppy straw to obtain large quantities of oripavine, a precursor to opioids and antagonists such as naltrexone. Although millennia older, the production of poppy head decoctions can be seen as a quick-and-dirty variant of the Kábáy poppy straw process, which since its publication in 1930 has become the major method of obtaining licit opium alkaloids worldwide, as discussed in Morphine.

Poppy seeds are a common and flavorsome topping for breads and cakes. One gram of poppy seeds contains up to 33 micrograms of morphine and 14 micrograms of codeine, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in the United States formerly mandated that all drug screening laboratories use a standard cutoff of 300 nanograms per milliliter in urine samples. A single poppy seed roll (0.76 grams of seeds) usually did not produce a positive drug test, but a positive result was observed from eating two rolls. A slice of poppy seed cake containing nearly five grams of seeds per slice produced positive results for 24 hours. Such results are viewed as false positive indications of drug use and were the basis of a legal defense. On November 30, 1998, the standard cutoff was increased to 2000 nanograms (two micrograms) per milliliter. Confirmation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry will distinguish amongst opium and variants including poppy seeds, heroin, and morphine and codeine pharmaceuticals by measuring the morphine:codeine ratio and looking for the presence of noscapine and acetylcodeine, the latter of which is only found in illicitly produced heroin, and heroin metabolites such as 6-monoacetylmorphine.

=== Harvesting and processing ===

When grown for opium production, the skin of the ripening pods of these poppies is scored by a sharp blade at a time carefully chosen so that rain, wind, and dew cannot spoil the exudation of white, milky latex, usually in the afternoon. Incisions are made while the pods are still raw, with no more than a slight yellow tint, and must be shallow to avoid penetrating hollow inner chambers or &quot;loculi&quot; while cutting into the lactiferous vessels. In the Indian Subcontinent, Afghanistan, Central Asia and Iran, the special tool used to make the incisions is called a &quot;nushtar&quot; or &quot;nishtar&quot; (from Persian, meaning a lancet) and carries three or four blades three millimeters apart, which are scored upward along the pod. Incisions are made three or four times at intervals of two to three days, and each time the &quot;poppy tears&quot;, which dry to a sticky brown resin, are collected the following morning. One acre harvested in this way can produce three to five kilograms of raw opium. In the Soviet Union, pods were typically scored horizontally, and opium was collected three times, or else one or two collections were followed by isolation of opiates from the ripe capsules. Oil poppies, an alternative strain of &quot;P. somniferum&quot;, were also used for production of opiates from their capsules and stems. A traditional Chinese method of harvesting opium latex involved cutting off the heads and piercing them with a coarse needle then collecting the dried opium 24 to 48 hours later.

Raw opium may be sold to a merchant or broker on the black market, but it usually does not travel far from the field before it is refined into morphine base, because pungent, jelly-like raw opium is bulkier and harder to smuggle. Crude laboratories in the field are capable of refining opium into morphine base by a simple acid-base extraction. A sticky, brown paste, morphine base is pressed into bricks and sun-dried, and can either be smoked, prepared into other forms or processed into heroin.

Other methods of preparation (besides smoking), include processing into regular opium tincture (&quot;tinctura opii&quot;), laudanum, paregoric (&quot;tinctura opii camphorata&quot;), herbal wine (e.g., &quot;vinum opii&quot;), opium powder (&quot;pulvis opii&quot;), opium sirup (&quot;sirupus opii&quot;) and opium extract (&quot;extractum opii&quot;). Vinum opii is made by combining sugar, white wine, cinnamon, and cloves. Opium syrup is made by combining 97.5 part sugar syrup with 2.5 parts opium extract. Opium extract (&quot;extractum opii&quot;) finally can be made by macerating raw opium with water. To make opium extract, 20 parts water are combined with 1 part raw opium which has been boiled for 5 minutes (the latter to ease mixing).

Heroin is widely preferred because of increased potency. One study in postaddicts found heroin to be approximately 2.2 times more potent than morphine by weight with a similar duration; at these relative quantities, they could distinguish the drugs subjectively but had no preference. Heroin was also found to be twice as potent as morphine in surgical anesthesia. Morphine is converted into heroin by a simple chemical reaction with acetic anhydride, followed by purification. Especially in Mexican production, opium may be converted directly to &quot;black tar heroin&quot; in a simplified procedure. This form predominates in the U.S. west of the Mississippi. Relative to other preparations of heroin, it has been associated with a dramatically decreased rate of HIV transmission among intravenous drug users (4 percent in Los Angeles vs. 40 percent in New York) due to technical requirements of injection, although it is also associated with greater risk of venous sclerosis and necrotizing fasciitis.

=== Illegal production ===


Afghanistan was formerly the primary producer of the drug. Having regularly producing 70 percent of the world&#x27;s opium, Afghanistan decreased production to 74 tons per year under a ban by the Taliban in 2000, a move which cut production by 94 percent. A year later, after American and British troops invaded Afghanistan, removed the Taliban and installed the interim government, the land under cultivation leapt back to , with Afghanistan supplanting Burma to become the world&#x27;s largest opium producer once more. Opium production increased rapidly in Afghanistan from that point, reaching an all-time high in 2006. According to DEA statistics, Afghanistan&#x27;s production of oven-dried opium increased to 1,278 tons in 2002, more than doubled by 2003, and nearly doubled again during 2004. In late 2004, the U.S. government estimated that 206,000 hectares were under poppy cultivation, 4.5 percent of the country&#x27;s total cropland, and produced 4,200 metric tons of opium, 76 percent of the world&#x27;s supply, yielding 60 percent of Afghanistan&#x27;s gross domestic product. In 2006, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime estimated production to have risen 59 percent to in cultivation, yielding 6,100 tons of opium, 82 percent of the world&#x27;s supply. The value of the resulting heroin was estimated at , of which Afghan farmers were estimated to have received in revenue. For farmers, the crop can be up to ten times more profitable than wheat. The price of opium is around per kilo. Opium production has led to rising tensions in Afghan villages. Though direct conflict has yet to occur, the opinions of the new class of young rich men involved in the opium trade are at odds with those of the traditional village leaders.

An increasingly large fraction of opium is processed into morphine base and heroin in drug labs in Afghanistan. Despite an international set of chemical controls designed to restrict availability of acetic anhydride, it enters the country, perhaps through its Central Asian neighbors which do not participate. A counternarcotics law passed in December 2005 requires Afghanistan to develop registries or regulations for tracking, storing, and owning acetic anhydride. In November 2023, a U.N report showed that in the entirety of Afghanistan, poppy cultivation dropped by over 95%, removing it from its place as being the world&#x27;s largest opium producer.

Besides Afghanistan, smaller quantities of opium are produced in Pakistan, the Golden Triangle region of Southeast Asia (particularly Burma), Colombia, Guatemala, and Mexico.
Chinese production mainly trades with and profits from North America. In 2002, they were seeking to expand through eastern United States. In the post 9/11 era, trading between borders became difficult and because new international laws were set into place, the opium trade became more diffused. Power shifted from remote to high-end smugglers and opium traders. Outsourcing became a huge factor for survival for many smugglers and opium farmers.

In 2023 Burma overtook Afghanistan and became the world&#x27;s largest producer of opium, producing 1080 metric tones according the UN Southeast Asia Opium Survey report.

=== Legal production ===

Legal opium production is allowed under the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and other international drug treaties, subject to strict supervision by the law enforcement agencies of individual countries. The leading legal production method is the Robertson-Gregory process, whereby the entire poppy, excluding roots and leaves, is mashed and stewed in dilute acid solutions. The alkaloids are then recovered via acid-base extraction and purified. The exact date of its discovery is unknown, but it was described by Wurtz in his &quot;Dictionnaire de chimie pure et appliquée&quot; published in 1868.

Legal opium production in India is much more traditional. As of 2008, opium was collected by farmers who were licensed to grow of opium poppies, who to maintain their licences needed to sell 56 kilograms of unadulterated raw opium paste. The price of opium paste is fixed by the government according to the quality and quantity tendered. The average is around 1500 rupees () per kilogram. Some additional money is made by drying the poppy heads and collecting poppy seeds, and a small fraction of opium beyond the quota may be consumed locally or diverted to the black market. The opium paste is dried and processed into government opium and alkaloid factories before it is packed into cases of 60 kilograms for export. Purification of chemical constituents is done in India for domestic production, but typically done abroad by foreign importers.

Legal opium importation from India and Turkey is conducted by Mallinckrodt, Noramco, Abbott Laboratories, Purdue Pharma, and Cody Laboratories Inc. in the United States, and legal opium production is conducted by GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Johnson Matthey, and Mayne in Tasmania, Australia; Sanofi Aventis in France; Shionogi Pharmaceutical in Japan; and MacFarlan Smith in the United Kingdom. The UN treaty requires that every country submit annual reports to the International Narcotics Control Board, stating that year&#x27;s actual consumption of many classes of controlled drugs as well as opioids and projecting required quantities for the next year. This is to allow trends in consumption to be monitored and production quotas allotted.

In 2005, the European Senlis Council began developing a programme which hopes to solve the problems caused by the large quantity of opium produced illegally in Afghanistan, most of which is converted to heroin and smuggled for sale in Europe and the United States. This proposal is to license Afghan farmers to produce opium for the world pharmaceutical market, and thereby solve another problem, that of chronic underuse of potent analgesics where required within developing nations. Part of the proposal is to overcome the &quot;80–20 rule&quot; that requires the U.S. to purchase 80 percent of its legal opium from India and Turkey to include Afghanistan, by establishing a second-tier system of supply control that complements the current INCB regulated supply and demand system by providing poppy-based medicines to countries who cannot meet their demand under the current regulations. Senlis arranged a conference in Kabul that brought drug policy experts from around the world to meet with Afghan government officials to discuss internal security, corruption issues, and legal issues within Afghanistan.
In June 2007, the council launched a &quot;Poppy for Medicines&quot; project that provides a technical blueprint for the implementation of an integrated control system within Afghan village-based poppy for medicine projects: the idea promotes the economic diversification by redirecting proceeds from the legal cultivation of poppy and production of poppy-based medicines. There has been criticism of the Senlis report findings by Macfarlan Smith, who argue that though they produce morphine in Europe, they were never asked to contribute to the report.

=== Cultivation in the UK ===
In late 2006, the British government permitted the pharmaceutical company MacFarlan Smith (a Johnson Matthey company) to cultivate opium poppies in England for medicinal reasons, after Macfarlan Smith&#x27;s primary source, India, decided to increase the price of export opium latex. This move is well received by British farmers, with a major opium poppy field located in Didcot, England. The British government has contradicted the Home Office&#x27;s suggestion that opium cultivation can be legalized in Afghanistan for exports to the United Kingdom, helping lower poverty and internal fighting while helping the NHS to meet the high demand for morphine and heroin. Opium poppy cultivation in the United Kingdom does not need a licence, but a licence is required for those wishing to extract opium for medicinal products.

=== Consumption ===

In the industrialized world, the United States is the world&#x27;s biggest consumer of prescription opioids, with Italy being one of the lowest, because of tighter regulations on prescribing narcotics for pain relief. Most opium imported into the United States is broken down into its alkaloid constituents, and whether legal or illegal, most current drug use occurs with processed derivatives such as heroin rather than with unrefined opium.

Intravenous injection of opiates is most used: by comparison with injection, &quot;dragon chasing&quot; (heating of heroin on a piece of foil), and madak and &quot;ack ack&quot; (smoking of cigarettes containing tobacco mixed with heroin powder) are only 40 percent and 20 percent efficient, respectively. One study of British heroin addicts found a 12-fold excess mortality ratio (1.8 percent of the group dying per year). Most heroin deaths result not from overdose &quot;per se&quot;, but combination with other depressant drugs such as alcohol or benzodiazepines.

The smoking of opium does not involve the burning of the material as might be imagined. Rather, the prepared opium is indirectly heated to temperatures at which the active alkaloids, chiefly morphine, are vaporized. In the past, smokers would use a specially designed opium pipe which had a removable knob-like pipe-bowl of fired earthenware attached by a metal fitting to a long, cylindrical stem. A small &quot;pill&quot; of opium about the size of a pea would be placed on the pipe-bowl, which was then heated by holding it over an opium lamp, a special oil lamp with a distinct funnel-like chimney to channel heat into a small area. The smoker would lie on his or her side in order to guide the pipe-bowl and the tiny pill of opium over the stream of heat rising from the chimney of the oil lamp and inhale the vaporized opium fumes as needed. Several pills of opium were smoked at a single session depending on the smoker&#x27;s tolerance to the drug. The effects could last up to twelve hours.

In Eastern culture, opium is more commonly used in the form of paregoric to treat diarrhea. This is a weaker solution than laudanum, an alcoholic tincture which was prevalently used as a pain medication and sleeping aid. Tincture of opium has been prescribed for, among other things, severe diarrhea. Taken thirty minutes prior to meals, it significantly slows intestinal motility, giving the intestines greater time to absorb fluid in the stool.

Despite the historically negative view of opium as a cause of addiction, the use of morphine and other derivatives isolated from opium in the treatment of chronic pain has been reestablished. If given in controlled doses, modern opiates can be an effective treatment for neuropathic pain and other forms of chronic pain.

== Chemical and physiological properties ==

Opium contains two main groups of alkaloids. Phenanthrenes such as morphine, codeine, and thebaine are the main psychoactive constituents. Isoquinolines such as papaverine and noscapine have no significant central nervous system effects. Morphine is the most prevalent and important alkaloid in opium, consisting of 10–16 percent of the total, and is responsible for most of its harmful effects such as lung edema, respiratory difficulties, coma, or cardiac or respiratory collapse. Morphine binds to and activates mu opioid receptors in the brain, spinal cord, stomach and intestine. Regular use can lead to drug tolerance or physical dependence. Chronic opium addicts in 1906 China consumed an average of eight grams of opium daily; opium addicts in modern Iran are thought to consume about the same.

Both analgesia and drug addiction are functions of the mu opioid receptor, the class of opioid receptor first identified as responsive to morphine. Tolerance is associated with the superactivation of the receptor, which may be affected by the degree of endocytosis caused by the opioid administered, and leads to a superactivation of cyclic AMP signaling. Long-term use of morphine in palliative care and the management of chronic pain always entails a risk that the patient develops tolerance or physical dependence. There are many kinds of rehabilitation treatment, including pharmacologically based treatments with naltrexone, methadone, or ibogaine.

In 2021, the International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that opium is a Group 1 (sufficient evidence) human carcinogen, causing cancers of the larynx, lung, and urinary bladder.

== Slang terms ==

Some slang terms for opium include: &quot;Big O&quot;, &quot;Shanghai Sally&quot;, &quot;dope&quot;, &quot;hop&quot;, &quot;midnight oil&quot;, &quot;O.P.&quot;, and &quot;tar&quot;. &quot;Dope&quot; and &quot;tar&quot; can also refer to heroin. The traditional opium pipe is known as a &quot;dream stick.&quot; The term &quot;dope&quot; entered the English language in the early nineteenth century, originally referring to viscous liquids, particularly sauces or gravy.  It has been used to refer to opiates since at least 1888, and this usage arose because opium, when prepared for smoking, is viscous.

<text>In computer science, an online algorithm is one that can process its input piece-by-piece in a serial fashion, i.e., in the order that the input is fed to the algorithm, without having the entire input available from the start. In contrast, an offline algorithm is given the whole problem data from the beginning and is required to output an answer which solves the problem at hand. 

In operations research, the area in which online algorithms are developed is called online optimization.

As an example, consider the sorting algorithms selection sort and insertion sort: selection sort repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted remainder and places it at the front, which requires access to the entire input; it is thus an offline algorithm. On the other hand, insertion sort considers one input element per iteration and produces a partial solution without considering future elements. Thus insertion sort is an online algorithm.

Note that the final result of an insertion sort is optimum, i.e., a correctly sorted list. For many problems, online algorithms cannot match the performance of offline algorithms. If the ratio between the performance of an online algorithm and an optimal offline algorithm is bounded, the online algorithm is called competitive.

Not every &quot;offline algorithm&quot; has an efficient &quot;online&quot; counterpart.

In grammar theory they are associated with Straight-line grammars.

== Definition ==
Because it does not know the whole input, an online algorithm is forced to make decisions that may later turn out not to be optimal, and the study of online algorithms has focused on the quality of decision-making that is possible in this setting. Competitive analysis formalizes this idea by comparing the relative performance of an online and offline algorithm for the same problem instance. Specifically, the competitive ratio of an algorithm, is defined as the worst-case ratio of its cost divided by the optimal cost, over all possible inputs. The competitive ratio of an online problem is the best competitive ratio achieved by an online algorithm. Intuitively, the competitive ratio of an algorithm gives a measure on the quality of solutions produced by this algorithm, while the competitive ratio of a problem shows the importance of knowing the future for this problem.

=== Other interpretations ===
For other points of view on &quot;online inputs to algorithms&quot;, see 
* streaming algorithm: focusing on the amount of memory needed to accurately represent past inputs;
* dynamic algorithm: focusing on the time complexity of maintaining solutions to problems with online inputs.

=== Examples ===
Some &quot;online algorithms&quot;:
*Insertion sort
*Perceptron
*Reservoir sampling

* Greedy algorithm
* Adversary model
* Metrical task systems
* Odds algorithm
* Page replacement algorithm
* Algorithms for calculating variance
* Ukkonen&#x27;s algorithm

== Online problems ==
A problem exemplifying the concepts of online algorithms is the Canadian traveller problem. The goal of this problem is to minimize the cost of reaching a target in a weighted graph where some of the edges are unreliable and may have been removed from the graph. However, that an edge has been removed (&quot;failed&quot;) is only revealed to &quot;the traveller&quot; when she/he reaches one of the edge&#x27;s endpoints. The worst case for this problem is simply that all of the unreliable edges fail and the problem reduces to the usual shortest path problem. An alternative analysis of the problem can be made with the help of competitive analysis. For this method of analysis, the offline algorithm knows in advance which edges will fail and the goal is to minimize the ratio between the online and offline algorithms&#x27; performance. This problem is PSPACE-complete.

There are many formal problems that offer more than one &quot;online algorithm&quot; as solution:
* &quot;k&quot;-server problem
* Job shop scheduling problem
* List update problem
* Bandit problem
* Secretary problem
* Search games
* Ski rental problem
* Linear search problem
* Portfolio selection problem

<doc id="22718" wikidata="Q36933" url="?curid=22718" title="Ozone">
<text>Ozone () (or trioxygen) is an inorganic molecule with the chemical formula . It is a pale blue gas with a distinctively pungent smell. It is an allotrope of oxygen that is much less stable than the diatomic allotrope , breaking down in the lower atmosphere to (dioxygen). Ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of ultraviolet (UV) light and electrical discharges within the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. It is present in very low concentrations throughout the atmosphere, with its highest concentration high in the ozone layer of the stratosphere, which absorbs most of the Sun&#x27;s ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

Ozone&#x27;s odor is reminiscent of chlorine, and detectable by many people at concentrations of as little as in air. Ozone&#x27;s O3 structure was determined in 1865. The molecule was later proven to have a bent structure and to be weakly diamagnetic. At standard temperature and pressure, ozone is a pale blue gas that condenses at cryogenic temperatures to a dark blue liquid and finally a violet-black solid. Ozone&#x27;s instability with regard to more common dioxygen is such that both concentrated gas and liquid ozone may decompose explosively at elevated temperatures, physical shock, or fast warming to the boiling point. It is therefore used commercially only in low concentrations.

Ozone is a powerful oxidizing agent (far more so than dioxygen) and has many industrial and consumer applications related to oxidation. This same high oxidizing potential, however, causes ozone to damage mucous and respiratory tissues in animals, and also tissues in plants, above concentrations of about . While this makes ozone a potent respiratory hazard and pollutant near ground level, a higher concentration in the ozone layer (from two to eight ppm) is beneficial, preventing damaging UV light from reaching the Earth&#x27;s surface.

==Nomenclature==
The trivial name &quot;ozone&quot; is the most commonly used and preferred IUPAC name. The systematic names &quot;2λ4-trioxidiene&quot; and &quot;catena-trioxygen&quot;, valid IUPAC names, are constructed according to the substitutive and additive nomenclatures, respectively. The name &quot;ozone&quot; derives from &quot;ozein&quot; (ὄζειν), the Greek neuter present participle for smell, referring to ozone&#x27;s distinctive smell.

In appropriate contexts, ozone can be viewed as trioxidane with two hydrogen atoms removed, and as such, &quot;trioxidanylidene&quot; may be used as a systematic name, according to substitutive nomenclature. By default, these names pay no regard to the radicality of the ozone molecule. In an even more specific context, this can also name the non-radical singlet ground state, whereas the diradical state is named &quot;trioxidanediyl&quot;.

&quot;Trioxidanediyl&quot; (or &quot;ozonide&quot;) is used, non-systematically, to refer to the substituent group (-OOO-). Care should be taken to avoid confusing the name of the group for the context-specific name for the ozone given above.

==History==
In 1785, Dutch chemist Martinus van Marum was conducting experiments involving electrical sparking above water when he noticed an unusual smell, which he attributed to the electrical reactions, failing to realize that he had in fact produced ozone.

A half century later, Christian Friedrich Schönbein noticed the same pungent odour and recognized it as the smell often following a bolt of lightning. In 1839, he succeeded in isolating the gaseous chemical and named it &quot;ozone&quot;, from the Greek word &quot;&quot; () meaning &quot;to smell&quot;.
For this reason, Schönbein is generally credited with the discovery of ozone. He also noted the similarity of ozone smell to the smell of phosphorus, and in 1844 proved that the product of reaction of white phosphorus with air is identical. A subsequent effort to call ozone &quot;electrified oxygen&quot; he ridiculed by proposing to call the ozone from white phosphorus &quot;phosphorized oxygen&quot;. The chemical formula for ozone, O3, was not determined until 1865 by Jacques-Louis Soret and confirmed by Schönbein in 1867.

For much of the second half of the 19th century and well into the 20th, ozone was considered a healthy component of the environment by naturalists and health-seekers. Beaumont, California, had as its official slogan &quot;Beaumont: Zone of Ozone&quot;, as evidenced on postcards and Chamber of Commerce letterhead. Naturalists working outdoors often considered the higher elevations beneficial because of their ozone content which was readily monitored. &quot;There is quite a different atmosphere [at higher elevation] with enough ozone to sustain the necessary energy [to work]&quot;, wrote naturalist Henry Henshaw, working in Hawaii. Seaside air was considered to be healthy because of its believed ozone content. The smell giving rise to this belief is in fact that of halogenated seaweed metabolites and dimethyl sulfide.

Much of ozone&#x27;s appeal seems to have resulted from its &quot;fresh&quot; smell, which evoked associations with purifying properties. Scientists noted its harmful effects. In 1873 James Dewar and John Gray McKendrick documented that frogs grew sluggish, birds gasped for breath, and rabbits&#x27; blood showed decreased levels of oxygen after exposure to &quot;ozonized air&quot;, which &quot;exercised a destructive action&quot;. Schönbein himself reported that chest pains, irritation of the mucous membranes, and difficulty breathing occurred as a result of inhaling ozone, and small mammals died. In 1911, Leonard Hill and Martin Flack stated in the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society B&quot; that ozone&#x27;s healthful effects &quot;have, by mere iteration, become part and parcel of common belief; and yet exact physiological evidence in favour of its good effects has been hitherto almost entirely wanting ... The only thoroughly well-ascertained knowledge concerning the physiological effect of ozone, so far attained, is that it causes irritation and œdema of the lungs, and death if inhaled in relatively strong concentration for any time.&quot;

During World War I, ozone was tested at Queen Alexandra Military Hospital in London as a possible disinfectant for wounds. The gas was applied directly to wounds for as long as 15 minutes. This resulted in damage to both bacterial cells and human tissue. Other sanitizing techniques, such as irrigation with antiseptics, were found preferable.

Until the 1920s, it was not certain whether small amounts of oxozone, , were also present in ozone samples due to the difficulty of applying analytical chemistry techniques to the explosive concentrated chemical. In 1923, Georg-Maria Schwab (working for his doctoral thesis under Ernst Hermann Riesenfeld) was the first to successfully solidify ozone and perform accurate analysis which conclusively refuted the oxozone hypothesis. Further hitherto unmeasured physical properties of pure concentrated ozone were determined by the Riesenfeld group in the 1920s.

==Physical properties==

Ozone is a colourless or pale blue gas, slightly soluble in water, and much more soluble in inert non-polar solvents such as carbon tetrachloride or fluorocarbons, in which it forms a blue solution. At , it condenses to form a dark blue liquid. It is dangerous to allow this liquid to warm to its boiling point, because both concentrated gaseous ozone and liquid ozone can detonate. At temperatures below , it forms a violet-black solid.

Ozone has a very specific sharp odour somewhat resembling chlorine bleach. Most people can detect it at the 0.01 μmol/mol level in air. Exposure of 0.1 to 1 μmol/mol produces headaches and burning eyes and irritates the respiratory passages.
Even low concentrations of ozone in air are very destructive to organic materials such as latex, plastics, and animal lung tissue.

The ozone molecule is weakly diamagnetic.

==Structure==
According to experimental evidence from microwave spectroscopy, ozone is a bent molecule, with C2v symmetry (similar to the water molecule). The O–O distances are . The O–O–O angle is 116.78°. The central atom is &quot;sp&quot;² hybridized with one lone pair. Ozone is a polar molecule with a dipole moment of 0.53 D. The molecule can be represented as a resonance hybrid with two contributing structures, each with a single bond on one side and double bond on the other. The arrangement possesses an overall bond order of 1.5 for both sides. It is isoelectronic with the nitrite anion. Naturally occurring ozone can be composed of substituted isotopes (16O, 17O, 18O). A cyclic form has been predicted but not observed.

==Reactions==

Ozone is among the most powerful oxidizing agents known, far stronger than . It is also unstable at high concentrations, decaying into ordinary diatomic oxygen. Its half-life varies with atmospheric conditions such as temperature, humidity, and air movement. Under laboratory conditions, the half-life will average ~1500 minutes (25 hours) in still air at room temperature (24 °C), zero humidity with zero air changes per hour.
:&lt;chem&gt;2 O3 -&gt; 3 O2&lt;/chem&gt;

This reaction proceeds more rapidly with increasing temperature. Deflagration of ozone can be triggered by a spark and can occur in ozone concentrations of 10 wt% or higher.

Ozone can also be produced from oxygen at the anode of an electrochemical cell. This reaction can create smaller quantities of ozone for research purposes.
:formula_1

This can be observed as an unwanted reaction in a Hoffman apparatus during the electrolysis of water when the voltage is set above the necessary voltage.

===With metals===
Ozone oxidizes most metals (except gold, platinum, and iridium) into oxides of the metals in their highest oxidation state. For example:
:formula_2

===With nitrogen and carbon compounds===
Ozone oxidizes nitric oxide to nitrogen dioxide:
: &lt;chem&gt;NO + O3 -&gt; NO2 + O2&lt;/chem&gt;
This reaction is accompanied by chemiluminescence.

The can be further oxidized to nitrate radical:
: &lt;chem&gt;NO2 + O3 -&gt; NO3 + O2&lt;/chem&gt;
The formed can react with to form dinitrogen pentoxide ().

Solid nitronium perchlorate can be made from , and gases:
: &lt;chem&gt;NO2 + ClO2 + 2 O3 -&gt; NO2ClO4 + 2 O2&lt;/chem&gt;

Ozone does not react with ammonium salts, but it oxidizes ammonia to ammonium nitrate:
: &lt;chem&gt;2 NH3 + 4 O3 -&gt; NH4NO3 + 4 O2 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

Ozone reacts with carbon to form carbon dioxide, even at room temperature:
: &lt;chem&gt;C + 2 O3 -&gt; CO2 + 2 O2&lt;/chem&gt;

===With sulfur compounds===
Ozone oxidizes sulfides to sulfates. For example, lead(II) sulfide is oxidized to lead(II) sulfate:
: &lt;chem&gt;PbS + 4 O3 -&gt; PbSO4 + 4 O2&lt;/chem&gt;

Sulfuric acid can be produced from ozone, water and either elemental sulfur or sulfur dioxide:
:formula_3

In the gas phase, ozone reacts with hydrogen sulfide to form sulfur dioxide:
: &lt;chem&gt;H2S + O3 -&gt; SO2 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

In an aqueous solution, however, two competing simultaneous reactions occur, one to produce elemental sulfur, and one to produce sulfuric acid:
:formula_4

===With alkenes and alkynes===

Alkenes can be oxidatively cleaved by ozone, in a process called ozonolysis, giving alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids, depending on the second step of the workup.

Ozone can also cleave alkynes to form an acid anhydride or diketone product. If the reaction is performed in the presence of water, the anhydride hydrolyzes to give two carboxylic acids.

Usually ozonolysis is carried out in a solution of dichloromethane, at a temperature of −78 °C. After a sequence of cleavage and rearrangement, an organic ozonide is formed. With reductive workup (e.g. zinc in acetic acid or dimethyl sulfide), ketones and aldehydes will be formed, with oxidative workup (e.g. aqueous or alcoholic hydrogen peroxide), carboxylic acids will be formed.

===Other substrates===
All three atoms of ozone may also react, as in the reaction of tin(II) chloride with hydrochloric acid and ozone:
: &lt;chem&gt;3 SnCl2 + 6 HCl + O3 -&gt; 3 SnCl4 + 3 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
Iodine perchlorate can be made by treating iodine dissolved in cold anhydrous perchloric acid with ozone:
: &lt;chem&gt;I2 + 6 HClO4 + O3 -&gt; 2 I(ClO4)3 + 3 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
Ozone could also react with potassium iodide to give oxygen and iodine gas that can be titrated for quantitative determination:
: &lt;chem&gt;2KI + O3 + H2O -&gt; 2KOH + O2 + I2&lt;/chem&gt;

===Combustion===
Ozone can be used for combustion reactions and combustible gases; ozone provides higher temperatures than burning in dioxygen (). The following is a reaction for the combustion of carbon subnitride which can also cause higher temperatures:
: &lt;chem&gt;3 C4N2 + 4 O3 -&gt; 12 CO + 3 N2&lt;/chem&gt;

Ozone can react at cryogenic temperatures. At , atomic hydrogen reacts with liquid ozone to form a hydrogen superoxide radical, which dimerizes:
:formula_5

===Ozone decomposition===

====Types of ozone decomposition====
Ozone is a toxic substance, commonly found or generated in human environments (aircraft cabins, offices with photocopiers, laser printers, sterilizers, ...).

The catalytic decomposition of ozone is very important to reduce pollution. This type of decomposition is the most widely used, especially with solid catalysts, and it has many advantages such as a higher conversion with a lower temperature. Furthermore, the product and the catalyst can be instantaneously separated, and this way the catalyst can be easily recovered without using any separation operation. The most-used materials in the catalytic decomposition of ozone in the gas phase are manganese dioxide, transition metals such as Mn, Co, Cu, Fe, Ni, or Ag, and noble metals such as Pt, Rh, or Pd.

Free radicals of chlorine (Cl), formed by the action of ultraviolet radiation on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and sea salt, are known to catalyze the breakdown of ozone in the atmosphere.

There are two other possibilities for decomposing ozone in the gas phase:
* Thermal decomposition, in which the ozone is decomposed using only the action of heat. The problem is that this type of decomposition is very slow with temperatures below 250 °C. However, the decomposition rate can be increased working with higher temperatures but this would involve a high energy cost.
* Photochemical decomposition, which consists of radiating ozone with ultraviolet radiation (UV) and it gives rise to oxygen and radical peroxide.

====Kinetics of ozone decomposition into molecular oxygen====
The process of ozone decomposition is a complex reaction involving two elementary reactions that finally lead to molecular oxygen, and this means that the reaction order and the rate law cannot be determined by the stoichiometry of the fitted equation.

Overall reaction: &lt;chem&gt;2 O3 -&gt; 3 O2&lt;/chem&gt;

Rate law (observed): formula_6

It has been determined that the ozone decomposition follows a first order kinetics, and from the rate law above it can be determined that the partial order respect to molecular oxygen is -1 and respect to ozone is 2, therefore the global reaction order is 1.

The ozone decomposition consists of two elementary steps: The first one corresponds to a unimolecular reaction because one only molecule of ozone decomposes into two products (molecular oxygen and oxygen). Then, the oxygen from the first step is an intermediate because it participates as a reactant in the second step, which is a bimolecular reaction because there are two different reactants (ozone and oxygen) that give rise to one product, that corresponds to molecular oxygen in the gas phase.

Step 1: Unimolecular reaction    &lt;chem&gt;O3 -&gt; O2 + O&lt;/chem&gt;

Step 2: Bimolecular reaction     &lt;chem&gt;O3 + O -&gt; 2 O2&lt;/chem&gt;

These two steps have different reaction rates, the first one is reversible and faster than the second reaction, which is slower, so this means that the determining step is the second reaction and this is used to determine the observed reaction rate. The reaction rate laws for every step are the ones that follow:
:formula_7

The following mechanism allows to explain the rate law of the ozone decomposition observed experimentally, and also it allows to determine the reaction orders with respect to ozone and oxygen, with which the overall reaction order will be determined. The slower step, the bimolecular reaction, is the one that determines the rate of product formation, and considering that this step gives rise to two oxygen molecules the rate law has this form:
:formula_8

However, this equation depends on the concentration of oxygen (intermediate), which can be determined considering the first step. Since the first step is faster and reversible and the second step is slower, the reactants and products from the first step are in equilibrium, so the concentration of the intermediate can be determined as follows:
:formula_9
:formula_10

Then using these equations, the formation rate of molecular oxygen is as shown below:
:formula_11

Finally, the mechanism presented allows to establish the rate observed experimentally, with a rate constant () and corresponding to a first order kinetics, as follows:
:formula_12

where formula_13

===Reduction to ozonides===
Reduction of ozone gives the ozonide anion, . Derivatives of this anion are explosive and must be stored at cryogenic temperatures. Ozonides for all the alkali metals are known. , and can be prepared from their respective superoxides:
: &lt;chem&gt;KO2 + O3 -&gt; KO3 + O2&lt;/chem&gt;
Although KO3 can be formed as above, it can also be formed from potassium hydroxide and ozone:
: &lt;chem&gt;2 KOH + 5 O3 -&gt; 2 KO3 + 5 O2 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
 and must be prepared by action of in liquid on an ion-exchange resin containing or ions:
: &lt;chem&gt;CsO3 + Na+ -&gt; Cs+ + NaO3&lt;/chem&gt;
A solution of calcium in ammonia reacts with ozone to give ammonium ozonide and not calcium ozonide:
: formula_14

===Applications===
Ozone can be used to remove iron and manganese from water, forming a precipitate which can be filtered:
:formula_15
Ozone oxidizes dissolved hydrogen sulfide in water to sulfurous acid:
: &lt;chem&gt;3 O3 + H2S -&gt; H2SO3 + 3 O2&lt;/chem&gt;

These three reactions are central in the use of ozone-based well water treatment.

Ozone detoxifies cyanides by converting them to cyanates.
: &lt;chem&gt;CN- + O3 -&gt; CNO- + O2&lt;/chem&gt;

Ozone completely decomposes urea:
:&lt;chem&gt;(NH2)2CO + O3 -&gt; N2 + CO2 + 2 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

==Spectroscopic properties==

Ozone is a bent triatomic molecule with three vibrational modes: the symmetric stretch (1103.157 cm−1), bend (701.42 cm−1) and antisymmetric stretch (1042.096 cm−1). The symmetric stretch and bend are weak absorbers, but the antisymmetric stretch is strong and responsible for ozone being an important minor greenhouse gas. This IR band is also used to detect ambient and atmospheric ozone although UV-based measurements are more common.

The electromagnetic spectrum of ozone is quite complex. An overview can be seen at the MPI Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas of Gaseous Molecules of Atmospheric Interest.

All of the bands are dissociative, meaning that the molecule falls apart to after absorbing a photon. The most important absorption is the Hartley band, extending from slightly above 300 nm down to slightly above 200 nm. It is this band that is responsible for absorbing UV C in the stratosphere.

On the high wavelength side, the Hartley band transitions to the so-called Huggins band, which falls off rapidly until disappearing by ~360 nm. Above 400 nm, extending well out into the NIR, are the Chappius and Wulf bands. There, unstructured absorption bands are useful for detecting high ambient concentrations of ozone, but are so weak that they do not have much practical effect.

There are additional absorption bands in the far UV, which increase slowly from 200 nm down to reaching a maximum at ~120 nm.

==Ozone in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere==

The standard way to express total ozone levels (the amount of ozone in a given vertical column) in the atmosphere is by using Dobson units. Point measurements are reported as mole fractions in nmol/mol (parts per billion, ppb) or as concentrations in μg/m3. The study of ozone concentration in the atmosphere started in the 1920s.

===Ozone layer===
====Location and production====
The highest levels of ozone in the atmosphere are in the stratosphere, in a region also known as the ozone layer between about 10 and 50 km above the surface (or between about 6 and 31 miles). However, even in this &quot;layer&quot;, the ozone concentrations are only two to eight parts per million, so most of the oxygen there is dioxygen, O2, at about 210,000 parts per million by volume.

Ozone in the stratosphere is mostly produced from short-wave ultraviolet rays between 240 and 160 nm. Oxygen starts to absorb weakly at 240 nm in the Herzberg bands, but most of the oxygen is dissociated by absorption in the strong Schumann–Runge bands between 200 and 160 nm where ozone does not absorb. While shorter wavelength light, extending to even the X-Ray limit, is energetic enough to dissociate molecular oxygen, there is relatively little of it, and, the strong solar emission at Lyman-alpha, 121 nm, falls at a point where molecular oxygen absorption is a minimum.

The process of ozone creation and destruction is called the Chapman cycle and starts with the photolysis of molecular oxygen
: &lt;chem&gt;O2 -&gt; [\ce{photon}] [(\ce{radiation}\ \lambda\ &lt;\ 240\ \ce{nm})] 2O&lt;/chem&gt;

followed by reaction of the oxygen atom with another molecule of oxygen to form ozone.
:&lt;chem&gt;O + O2 + M -&gt; O3 + M&lt;/chem&gt;

where &quot;M&quot; denotes the third body that carries off the excess energy of the reaction. The ozone molecule can then absorb a UV-C photon and dissociate
:formula_16

The excess kinetic energy heats the stratosphere when the O atoms and the molecular oxygen fly apart and collide with other molecules. This conversion of UV light into kinetic energy warms the stratosphere. The oxygen atoms produced in the photolysis of ozone then react back with other oxygen molecule as in the previous step to form more ozone. In the clear atmosphere, with only nitrogen and oxygen, ozone can react with the atomic oxygen to form two molecules of :
:&lt;chem&gt;O3 + O -&gt; 2 O2&lt;/chem&gt;

An estimate of the rate of this termination step to the cycling of atomic oxygen back to ozone can be found simply by taking the ratios of the concentration of O2 to O3. The termination reaction is catalysed by the presence of certain free radicals, of which the most important are hydroxyl (OH), nitric oxide (NO) and atomic chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br). In the second half of the 20th century, the amount of ozone in the stratosphere was discovered to be declining, mostly because of increasing concentrations of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) and similar chlorinated and brominated organic molecules. The concern over the health effects of the decline led to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, the ban on the production of many ozone-depleting chemicals and in the first and second decade of the 21st century the beginning of the recovery of stratospheric ozone concentrations.

====Importance to surface-dwelling life on Earth====
Ozone in the ozone layer filters out sunlight wavelengths from about 200 nm UV rays to 315 nm, with ozone peak absorption at about 250 nm. This ozone UV absorption is important to life, since it extends the absorption of UV by ordinary oxygen and nitrogen in air (which absorb all wavelengths &lt; 200 nm) through the lower UV-C (200–280 nm) and the entire UV-B band (280–315 nm). The small unabsorbed part that remains of UV-B after passage through ozone causes sunburn in humans, and direct DNA damage in living tissues in both plants and animals. Ozone&#x27;s effect on mid-range UV-B rays is illustrated by its effect on UV-B at 290 nm, which has a radiation intensity 350 million times as powerful at the top of the atmosphere as at the surface. Nevertheless, enough of UV-B radiation at similar frequency reaches the ground to cause some sunburn, and these same wavelengths are also among those responsible for the production of vitamin D in humans.

The ozone layer has little effect on the longer UV wavelengths called UV-A (315–400 nm), but this radiation does not cause sunburn or direct DNA damage. While UV-A probably does cause long-term skin damage in certain humans, it is not as dangerous to plants and to the health of surface-dwelling organisms on Earth in general (see ultraviolet for more information on near ultraviolet).

===Ground-level ozone===

Ground-level ozone (or tropospheric ozone) is an atmospheric pollutant. It is not emitted directly by car engines or by industrial operations, but formed by the reaction of sunlight on air containing hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides that react to form ozone directly at the source of the pollution or many kilometers downwind.

Ozone reacts directly with some hydrocarbons such as aldehydes and thus begins their removal from the air, but the products are themselves key components of smog. Ozone photolysis by UV light leads to production of the hydroxyl radical HO• and this plays a part in the removal of hydrocarbons from the air, but is also the first step in the creation of components of smog such as peroxyacyl nitrates, which can be powerful eye irritants. The atmospheric lifetime of tropospheric ozone is about 22 days; its main removal mechanisms are being deposited to the ground, the above-mentioned reaction giving HO•, and by reactions with OH and the peroxy radical HO2•.

There is evidence of significant reduction in agricultural yields because of increased ground-level ozone and pollution which interferes with photosynthesis and stunts overall growth of some plant species. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed a secondary regulation to reduce crop damage, in addition to the primary regulation designed for the protection of human health.

====Ground-level ozone in urban areas====
Certain examples of cities with elevated ozone readings are Denver, Colorado; Houston, Texas; and Mexico City, Mexico. Houston has a reading of around 41 nmol/mol, while Mexico City is far more hazardous, with a reading of about 125 nmol/mol.

Ground-level ozone, or tropospheric ozone, is the most concerning type of ozone pollution in urban areas and is increasing in general. Ozone pollution in urban areas affects denser populations, and is worsened by high populations of vehicles, which emit pollutants NO2 and VOCs, the main contributors to problematic ozone levels. Ozone pollution in urban areas is especially concerning with increasing temperatures, raising heat-related mortality during heat waves. During heat waves in urban areas, ground level ozone pollution can be 20% higher than usual. Ozone pollution in urban areas reaches higher levels of exceedance in the summer and autumn, which may be explained by weather patterns and traffic patterns. People experiencing poverty are more affected by pollution in general, even though these populations are less likely to be contributing to pollution levels.

As mentioned above, Denver, Colorado, is one of the many cities in the U.S. that have high amounts of ozone. According to the American Lung Association, the Denver–Aurora area is the 14th most ozone-polluted area in the U.S. The problem of high ozone levels is not new to this area. In 2004, the EPA allotted the Denver Metro/North Front Range as non-attainment areas per 1997&#x27;s 8-hour ozone standard, but later deferred this status until 2007. The non-attainment standard indicates that an area does not meet the EPA&#x27;s air quality standards. The Colorado Ozone Action Plan was created in response, and numerous changes were implemented from this plan. The first major change was that car emission testing was expanded across the state to more counties that did not previously mandate emissions testing, like areas of Larimer and Weld County. There have also been changes made to decrease Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions, which should help lower ozone levels.

One large contributor to high ozone levels in the area is the oil and natural gas industry situated in the Denver-Julesburg Basin (DJB) which overlaps with a majority of Colorado&#x27;s metropolitan areas. Ozone is produced naturally in the Earth&#x27;s stratosphere, but is also produced in the troposphere from human efforts. Briefly mentioned above, NOx and VOCs react with sunlight to create ozone through a process called photochemistry. One hour elevated ozone events (&lt;75 ppb) &quot;occur during June–August indicating that elevated ozone levels are driven by regional photochemistry&quot;. According to an article from the University of Colorado-Boulder, &quot;Oil and natural gas VOC emission have a major role in ozone production and bear the potential to contribute to elevated O3 levels in the Northern Colorado Front Range (NCFR)&quot;. Using complex analyses to research wind patterns and emissions from large oil and natural gas operations, the authors concluded that &quot;elevated O3 levels in the NCFR are predominantly correlated with air transport from N– ESE, which are the upwind sectors where the O&amp;NG operations in the Wattenberg Field area of the DJB are located&quot;.

Contained in the Colorado Ozone Action Plan, created in 2008, plans exist to evaluate &quot;emission controls for large industrial sources of NOx&quot; and &quot;statewide control requirements for new oil and gas condensate tanks and pneumatic valves&quot;. In 2011, the Regional Haze Plan was released that included a more specific plan to help decrease NOx emissions. These efforts are increasingly difficult to implement and take many years to come to pass. Of course there are also other reasons that ozone levels remain high. These include: a growing population meaning more car emissions, and the mountains along the NCFR that can trap emissions. If interested, daily air quality readings can be found at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment&#x27;s website. As noted earlier, Denver continues to experience high levels of ozone to this day. It will take many years and a systems-thinking approach to combat this issue of high ozone levels in the Front Range of Colorado.

====Ozone cracking====
Ozone gas attacks any polymer possessing olefinic or double bonds within its chain structure, such as natural rubber, nitrile rubber, and styrene-butadiene rubber. Products made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack, which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time, the rate of crack growth depending on the load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Such materials can be protected by adding antiozonants, such as waxes, which bond to the surface to create a protective film or blend with the material and provide long term protection. Ozone cracking used to be a serious problem in car tires, for example, but it is not an issue with modern tires. On the other hand, many critical products, like gaskets and O-rings, may be attacked by ozone produced within compressed air systems. Fuel lines made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack, especially within the engine compartment, where some ozone is produced by electrical components. Storing rubber products in close proximity to a DC electric motor can accelerate ozone cracking. The commutator of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone.

===Ozone as a greenhouse gas===

Although ozone was present at ground level before the Industrial Revolution, peak concentrations are now far higher than the pre-industrial levels, and even background concentrations well away from sources of pollution are substantially higher. Ozone acts as a greenhouse gas, absorbing some of the infrared energy emitted by the earth. Quantifying the greenhouse gas potency of ozone is difficult because it is not present in uniform concentrations across the globe. However, the most widely accepted scientific assessments relating to climate change (e.g. the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third Assessment Report) suggest that the radiative forcing of tropospheric ozone is about 25% that of carbon dioxide.

The annual global warming potential of tropospheric ozone is between 918 and 1022 tons carbon dioxide equivalent/tons tropospheric ozone. This means on a per-molecule basis, ozone in the troposphere has a radiative forcing effect roughly 1,000 times as strong as carbon dioxide. However, tropospheric ozone is a short-lived greenhouse gas, which decays in the atmosphere much more quickly than carbon dioxide. This means that over a 20-year span, the global warming potential of tropospheric ozone is much less, roughly 62 to 69 tons carbon dioxide equivalent / ton tropospheric ozone.

Because of its short-lived nature, tropospheric ozone does not have strong global effects, but has very strong radiative forcing effects on regional scales. In fact, there are regions of the world where tropospheric ozone has a radiative forcing up to 150% of carbon dioxide. For example, ozone increase in the troposphere is shown to be responsible for ~30% of upper Southern Ocean interior warming between 1955 and 2000.

==Health effects==

For the last few decades, scientists studied the effects of acute and chronic ozone exposure on human health. Hundreds of studies suggest that ozone is harmful to people at levels currently found in urban areas. Ozone has been shown to affect the respiratory, cardiovascular and central nervous system. Early death and problems in reproductive health and development are also shown to be associated with ozone exposure.

===Vulnerable populations===
The American Lung Association has identified five populations who are especially vulnerable to the effects of breathing ozone:
# Children and teens
# People 65 years old and older
# People who work or exercise outdoors
# People with existing lung diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (also known as COPD, which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis)
# People with cardiovascular disease
Additional evidence suggests that women, those with obesity and low-income populations may also face higher risk from ozone, although more research is needed.

===Acute ozone exposure===
Acute ozone exposure ranges from hours to a few days. Because ozone is a gas, it directly affects the lungs and the entire respiratory system. Inhaled ozone causes inflammation and acute—but reversible—changes in lung function, as well as airway hyperresponsiveness. These changes lead to shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing which may exacerbate lung diseases, like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) resulting in the need to receive medical treatment. Acute and chronic exposure to ozone has been shown to cause an increased risk of respiratory infections, due to the following mechanism.

Multiple studies have been conducted to determine the mechanism behind ozone&#x27;s harmful effects, particularly in the lungs. These studies have shown that exposure to ozone causes changes in the immune response within the lung tissue, resulting in disruption of both the innate and adaptive immune response, as well as altering the protective function of lung epithelial cells. It is thought that these changes in immune response and the related inflammatory response are factors that likely contribute to the increased risk of lung infections, and worsening or triggering of asthma and reactive airways after exposure to ground-level ozone pollution.

The innate (cellular) immune system consists of various chemical signals and cell types that work broadly and against multiple pathogen types, typically bacteria or foreign bodies/substances in the host. The cells of the innate system include phagocytes, neutrophils, both thought to contribute to the mechanism of ozone pathology in the lungs, as the functioning of these cell types have been shown to change after exposure to ozone. Macrophages, cells that serve the purpose of eliminating pathogens or foreign material through the process of &quot;phagocytosis&quot;, have been shown to change the level of inflammatory signals they release in response to ozone, either up-regulating and resulting in an inflammatory response in the lung, or down-regulating and reducing immune protection. Neutrophils, another important cell type of the innate immune system that primarily targets bacterial pathogens, are found to be present in the airways within 6 hours of exposure to high ozone levels. Despite high levels in the lung tissues, however, their ability to clear bacteria appears impaired by exposure to ozone.

The adaptive immune system is the branch of immunity that provides long-term protection via the development of antibodies targeting specific pathogens and is also impacted by high ozone exposure. Lymphocytes, a cellular component of the adaptive immune response, produce an increased amount of inflammatory chemicals called &quot;cytokines&quot; after exposure to ozone, which may contribute to airway hyperreactivity and worsening asthma symptoms.

The airway epithelial cells also play an important role in protecting individuals from pathogens. In normal tissue, the epithelial layer forms a protective barrier, and also contains specialized ciliary structures that work to clear foreign bodies, mucus and pathogens from the lungs. When exposed to ozone, the cilia become damaged and mucociliary clearance of pathogens is reduced. Furthermore, the epithelial barrier becomes weakened, allowing pathogens to cross the barrier, proliferate and spread into deeper tissues. Together, these changes in the epithelial barrier help make individuals more susceptible to pulmonary infections.

Inhaling ozone not only affects the immune system and lungs, but it may also affect the heart as well. Ozone causes short-term autonomic imbalance leading to changes in heart rate and reduction in heart rate variability; and high levels exposure for as little as one-hour results in a supraventricular arrhythmia in the elderly, both increase the risk of premature death and stroke. Ozone may also lead to vasoconstriction resulting in increased systemic arterial pressure contributing to increased risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients with pre-existing cardiac diseases.

===Chronic ozone exposure===
Breathing ozone for periods longer than eight hours at a time for weeks, months or years defines chronic exposure. Numerous studies suggest a serious impact on the health of various populations from this exposure.

One study finds significant positive associations between chronic ozone and all-cause, circulatory, and respiratory mortality with 2%, 3%, and 12% increases in risk per 10 ppb and report an association (95% CI) of annual ozone and all-cause mortality with a hazard ratio of 1.02 (1.01–1.04), and with cardiovascular mortality of 1.03 (1.01–1.05). A similar study finds similar associations with all-cause mortality and even larger effects for cardiovascular mortality. An increased risk of mortality from respiratory causes is associated with long-term chronic exposure to ozone.

Chronic ozone has detrimental effects on children, especially those with asthma. The risk for hospitalization in children with asthma increases with chronic exposure to ozone; younger children and those with low-income status are even at greater risk.

Adults suffering from respiratory diseases (asthma, COPD, lung cancer) are at a higher risk of mortality and morbidity and critically ill patients have an increased risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome with chronic ozone exposure as well.

===Ozone produced by air cleaners===
Ozone generators sold as air cleaners intentionally produce the gas ozone. These are often marketed to control indoor air pollution, and use misleading terms to describe ozone. Some examples are describing it as &quot;energized oxygen&quot; or &quot;pure air&quot;, suggesting that ozone is a healthy or &quot;better&quot; kind of oxygen. However, according to the EPA, &quot;There is evidence to show that at concentrations that do not exceed public health standards, ozone is not effective at removing many odor-causing chemicals&quot;, and &quot;If used at concentrations that do not exceed public health standards, ozone applied to indoor air does not effectively remove viruses, bacteria, mold, or other biological pollutants.&quot;. Furthermore, another report states that &quot;results of some controlled studies show that concentrations of ozone considerably higher than these [human safety] standards are possible even when a user follows the manufacturer&#x27;s operating instructions&quot;.

The California Air Resources Board has a page listing air cleaners (many with ionizers) meeting their indoor ozone limit of 0.050 parts per million. From that article:

All portable indoor air cleaning devices sold in California must be certified by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). To be certified, air cleaners must be tested for electrical safety and ozone emissions, and meet an ozone emission concentration limit of 0.050 parts per million. For more information about the regulation, visit the air cleaner regulation.

===Ozone air pollution===


Ozone precursors are a group of pollutants, predominantly those emitted during the combustion of fossil fuels. Ground-level ozone pollution (tropospheric ozone) is produced near the Earth&#x27;s surface by the action of daylight UV rays on these precursors. The ozone at ground level is primarily from fossil fuel precursors, but methane is a natural precursor, and the very low natural background level of ozone at ground level is considered safe. This section examines the health impacts of fossil fuel burning, which raises ground level ozone far above background levels.

There is a great deal of evidence to show that ground-level ozone can harm lung function and irritate the respiratory system. Exposure to ozone (and the pollutants that produce it) is linked to premature death, asthma, bronchitis, heart attack, and other cardiopulmonary problems.

Long-term exposure to ozone has been shown to increase risk of death from respiratory illness. A study of 450,000 people living in U.S. cities saw a significant correlation between ozone levels and respiratory illness over the 18-year follow-up period. The study revealed that people living in cities with high ozone levels, such as Houston or Los Angeles, had an over 30% increased risk of dying from lung disease.

Air quality guidelines such as those from the World Health Organization, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the European Union are based on detailed studies designed to identify the levels that can cause measurable ill health effects.

According to scientists with the EPA, susceptible people can be adversely affected by ozone levels as low as 40 nmol/mol. In the EU, the current target value for ozone concentrations is 120 μg/m3 which is about 60 nmol/mol. This target applies to all member states in accordance with Directive 2008/50/EC. Ozone concentration is measured as a maximum daily mean of 8 hour averages and the target should not be exceeded on more than 25 calendar days per year, starting from January 2010. While the directive requires in the future a strict compliance with 120 μg/m3 limit (i.e. mean ozone concentration not to be exceeded on any day of the year), there is no date set for this requirement and this is treated as a long-term objective.

In the US, the Clean Air Act directs the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for several pollutants, including ground-level ozone, and counties out of compliance with these standards are required to take steps to reduce their levels. In May 2008, under a court order, the EPA lowered its ozone standard from 80 nmol/mol to 75 nmol/mol. The move proved controversial, since the Agency&#x27;s own scientists and advisory board had recommended lowering the standard to 60 nmol/mol. Many public health and environmental groups also supported the 60 nmol/mol standard, and the World Health Organization recommends 100 μg/m3 (51 nmol/mol).

On January 7, 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced proposed revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for the pollutant ozone, the principal component of smog:

... EPA proposes that the level of the 8-hour primary standard, which was set at 0.075 μmol/mol in the 2008 final rule, should instead be set at a lower level within the range of 0.060 to 0.070 μmol/mol, to provide increased protection for children and other &quot;at risk&quot; populations against an array of – related adverse health effects that range from decreased lung function and increased respiratory symptoms to serious indicators of respiratory morbidity including emergency department visits and hospital admissions for respiratory causes, and possibly cardiovascular-related morbidity as well as total non- accidental and cardiopulmonary mortality ...

On October 26, 2015, the EPA published a final rule with an effective date of December 28, 2015, that revised the 8-hour primary NAAQS from 0.075 ppm to 0.070 ppm.

The EPA has developed an air quality index (AQI) to help explain air pollution levels to the general public. Under the current standards, eight-hour average ozone mole fractions of 85 to 104 nmol/mol are described as &quot;unhealthy for sensitive groups&quot;, 105 nmol/mol to 124 nmol/mol as &quot;unhealthy&quot;, and 125 nmol/mol to 404 nmol/mol as &quot;very unhealthy&quot;.

Ozone can also be present in indoor air pollution, partly as a result of electronic equipment such as photocopiers. A connection has also been known to exist between the increased pollen, fungal spores, and ozone caused by thunderstorms and hospital admissions of asthma sufferers.

In the Victorian era, one British folk myth held that the smell of the sea was caused by ozone. In fact, the characteristic &quot;smell of the sea&quot; is caused by dimethyl sulfide, a chemical generated by phytoplankton. Victorian Britons considered the resulting smell &quot;bracing&quot;.

====Heat waves====
An investigation to assess the joint mortality effects of ozone and heat during the European heat waves in 2003, concluded that these appear to be additive.

===Physiology===

Ozone, along with reactive forms of oxygen such as superoxide, singlet oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, and hypochlorite ions, is produced by white blood cells and other biological systems (such as the roots of marigolds) as a means of destroying foreign bodies. Ozone reacts directly with organic double bonds. Also, when ozone breaks down to dioxygen it gives rise to oxygen free radicals, which are highly reactive and capable of damaging many organic molecules. Moreover, it is believed that the powerful oxidizing properties of ozone may be a contributing factor of inflammation. The cause-and-effect relationship of how the ozone is created in the body and what it does is still under consideration and still subject to various interpretations, since other body chemical processes can trigger some of the same reactions. There is evidence linking the antibody-catalyzed water-oxidation pathway of the human immune response to the production of ozone. In this system, ozone is produced by antibody-catalyzed production of trioxidane from water and neutrophil-produced singlet oxygen.

When inhaled, ozone reacts with compounds lining the lungs to form specific, cholesterol-derived metabolites that are thought to facilitate the build-up and pathogenesis of atherosclerotic plaques (a form of heart disease). These metabolites have been confirmed as naturally occurring in human atherosclerotic arteries and are categorized into a class of secosterols termed &quot;atheronals&quot;, generated by ozonolysis of cholesterol&#x27;s double bond to form a 5,6 secosterol as well as a secondary condensation product via aldolization.

===Impact on plant growth and crop yields===
Ozone has been implicated to have an adverse effect on plant growth: &quot;... ozone reduced total chlorophylls, carotenoid and carbohydrate concentration, and increased 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) content and ethylene production. In treated plants, the ascorbate leaf pool was decreased, while lipid peroxidation and solute leakage were significantly higher than in ozone-free controls. The data indicated that ozone triggered protective mechanisms against oxidative stress in citrus.&quot; Studies that have used pepper plants as a model have shown that ozone decreased fruit yield and changed fruit quality. Furthermore, it was also observed a decrease in chlorophylls levels and antioxidant defences on the leaves, as well as increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and lipid and protein damages.

A 2022 study concludes that East Asia loses 63 billion dollars in crops per year due to ozone pollution, a byproduct of fossil fuel combustion. China loses about one-third of its potential wheat production and one-fourth of its rice production.

===Safety regulations===
Because of the strongly oxidizing properties of ozone, ozone is a primary irritant, affecting especially the eyes and respiratory systems and can be hazardous at even low concentrations. The Canadian Centre for Occupation Safety and Health reports that:

Even very low concentrations of ozone can be harmful to the upper respiratory tract and the lungs. The severity of injury depends on both the concentration of ozone and the duration of exposure. Severe and permanent lung injury or death could result from even a very short-term exposure to relatively low concentrations.&quot;

To protect workers potentially exposed to ozone, U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established a permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.1 μmol/mol (29 CFR 1910.1000 table Z-1), calculated as an 8-hour time weighted average. Higher concentrations are especially hazardous and NIOSH has established an Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health Limit (IDLH) of 5 μmol/mol. Work environments where ozone is used or where it is likely to be produced should have adequate ventilation and it is prudent to have a monitor for ozone that will alarm if the concentration exceeds the OSHA PEL. Continuous monitors for ozone are available from several suppliers.

Elevated ozone exposure can occur on passenger aircraft, with levels depending on altitude and atmospheric turbulence. U.S. Federal Aviation Administration regulations set a limit of 250 nmol/mol with a maximum four-hour average of 100 nmol/mol. Some planes are equipped with ozone converters in the ventilation system to reduce passenger exposure.

==Production==
Ozone generators, or ozonators, are used to produce ozone for cleaning air or removing smoke odours in unoccupied rooms. These ozone generators can produce over 3 g of ozone per hour. Ozone often forms in nature under conditions where O2 will not react. Ozone used in industry is measured in μmol/mol (ppm, parts per million), nmol/mol (ppb, parts per billion), μg/m3, mg/h (milligrams per hour) or weight percent. The regime of applied concentrations ranges from 1% to 5% (in air) and from 6% to 14% (in oxygen) for older generation methods. New electrolytic methods can achieve up 20% to 30% dissolved ozone concentrations in output water.

Temperature and humidity play a large role in how much ozone is being produced using traditional generation methods (such as corona discharge and ultraviolet light). Old generation methods will produce less than 50% of nominal capacity if operated with humid ambient air, as opposed to very dry air. New generators, using electrolytic methods, can achieve higher purity and dissolution through using water molecules as the source of ozone production.

===Coronal discharge method===

This is the most common type of ozone generator for most industrial and personal uses. While variations of the &quot;hot spark&quot; coronal discharge method of ozone production exist, including medical grade and industrial grade ozone generators, these units usually work by means of a corona discharge tube or ozone plate. They are typically cost-effective and do not require an oxygen source other than the ambient air to produce ozone concentrations of 3–6%. Fluctuations in ambient air, due to weather or other environmental conditions, cause variability in ozone production. However, they also produce nitrogen oxides as a by-product. Use of an air dryer can reduce or eliminate nitric acid formation by removing water vapor and increase ozone production. At room temperature, nitric acid will form into a vapour that is hazardous if inhaled. Symptoms can include chest pain, shortness of breath, headaches and a dry nose and throat causing a burning sensation. Use of an oxygen concentrator can further increase the ozone production and further reduce the risk of nitric acid formation by removing not only the water vapor, but also the bulk of the nitrogen.

===Ultraviolet light===

UV ozone generators, or vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) ozone generators, employ a light source that generates a narrow-band ultraviolet light, a subset of that produced by the Sun. The Sun&#x27;s UV sustains the ozone layer in the stratosphere of Earth.

UV ozone generators use ambient air for ozone production, no air prep systems are used (air dryer or oxygen concentrator), therefore these generators tend to be less expensive. However, UV ozone generators usually produce ozone with a concentration of about 0.5% or lower which limits the potential ozone production rate. Another disadvantage of this method is that it requires the ambient air (oxygen) to be exposed to the UV source for a longer amount of time, and any gas that is not exposed to the UV source will not be treated. This makes UV generators impractical for use in situations that deal with rapidly moving air or water streams (in-duct air sterilization, for example). Production of ozone is one of the potential dangers of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. VUV ozone generators are used in swimming pools and spa applications ranging to millions of gallons of water. VUV ozone generators, unlike corona discharge generators, do not produce harmful nitrogen by-products and also unlike corona discharge systems, VUV ozone generators work extremely well in humid air environments. There is also not normally a need for expensive off-gas mechanisms, and no need for air driers or oxygen concentrators which require extra costs and maintenance.

===Cold plasma===
In the cold plasma method, pure oxygen gas is exposed to a plasma created by DBD. The diatomic oxygen is split into single atoms, which then recombine in triplets to form ozone.

It is common in the industry to mislabel some DBD ozone generators as CD Corona Discharge generators. Typically all solid flat metal electrode ozone generators produce ozone using the dielectric barrier discharge method. Cold plasma machines use pure oxygen as the input source and produce a maximum concentration of about 24% ozone. They produce far greater quantities of ozone in a given time compared to ultraviolet production that has about 2% efficiency. The discharges manifest as filamentary transfer of electrons (micro discharges) in a gap between two electrodes. In order to evenly distribute the micro discharges, a dielectric insulator must be used to separate the metallic electrodes and to prevent arcing.

===Electrolytic===
Electrolytic ozone generation (EOG) splits water molecules into H2, O2, and O3.

In most EOG methods, the hydrogen gas will be removed to leave oxygen and ozone as the only reaction products. Therefore, EOG can achieve higher dissolution in water without other competing gases found in corona discharge method, such as nitrogen gases present in ambient air. This method of generation can achieve concentrations of 20–30% and is independent of air quality because water is used as the source material. Production of ozone electrolytically is typically unfavorable because of the high overpotential required to produce ozone as compared to oxygen. This is why ozone is not produced during typical water electrolysis. However, it is possible to increase the overpotential of oxygen by careful catalyst selection such that ozone is preferentially produced under electrolysis. Catalysts typically chosen for this approach are lead dioxide or boron-doped diamond.

The ozone-to-oxygen ratio is improved by increasing current density at the anode, cooling the electrolyte around the anode close to 0 °C, using an acidic electrolyte (such as dilute sulfuric acid) instead of a basic solution, and by applying pulsed current instead of DC.

===Special considerations===
Ozone cannot be stored and transported like other industrial gases (because it quickly decays into diatomic oxygen) and must therefore be produced on site. Available ozone generators vary in the arrangement and design of the high-voltage electrodes. At production capacities higher than 20 kg per hour, a gas/water tube heat-exchanger may be utilized as ground electrode and assembled with tubular high-voltage electrodes on the gas-side. The regime of typical gas pressures is around absolute in oxygen and absolute in air. Several megawatts of electrical power may be installed in large facilities, applied as single phase AC current at 50 to 8000 Hz and peak voltages between 3,000 and 20,000 volts. Applied voltage is usually inversely related to the applied frequency.

The dominating parameter influencing ozone generation efficiency is the gas temperature, which is controlled by cooling water temperature and/or gas velocity. The cooler the water, the better the ozone synthesis. The lower the gas velocity, the higher the concentration (but the lower the net ozone produced). At typical industrial conditions, almost 90% of the effective power is dissipated as heat and needs to be removed by a sufficient cooling water flow.

Because of the high reactivity of ozone, only a few materials may be used like stainless steel (quality 316L), titanium, aluminium (as long as no moisture is present), glass, polytetrafluorethylene, or polyvinylidene fluoride. Viton may be used with the restriction of constant mechanical forces and absence of humidity (humidity limitations apply depending on the formulation). Hypalon may be used with the restriction that no water comes in contact with it, except for normal atmospheric levels. Embrittlement or shrinkage is the common mode of failure of elastomers with exposure to ozone. Ozone cracking is the common mode of failure of elastomer seals like O-rings.

Silicone rubbers are usually adequate for use as gaskets in ozone concentrations below 1 wt%, such as in equipment for accelerated aging of rubber samples.

===Incidental production===
Ozone may be formed from by electrical discharges and by action of high energy electromagnetic radiation. Unsuppressed arcing in electrical contacts, motor brushes, or mechanical switches breaks down the chemical bonds of the atmospheric oxygen surrounding the contacts [ -&gt; 2O]. Free radicals of oxygen in and around the arc recombine to create ozone []. Certain electrical equipment generate significant levels of ozone. This is especially true of devices using high voltages, such as ionic air purifiers, laser printers, photocopiers, tasers, and arc welders. Electric motors using brushes can generate ozone from repeated sparking inside the unit. Large motors that use brushes, such as those used by elevators or hydraulic pumps, will generate more ozone than smaller motors.

Ozone is similarly formed in the Catatumbo lightning storms phenomenon on the Catatumbo River in Venezuela, though ozone&#x27;s instability makes it dubious that it has any effect on the ozonosphere.
It is the world&#x27;s largest single natural generator of ozone, lending calls for it to be designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

===Laboratory production===

In the laboratory, ozone can be produced by electrolysis using a 9 volt battery, a pencil graphite rod cathode, a platinum wire anode, and a 3 molar sulfuric acid electrolyte. The half cell reactions taking place are:
:formula_17

where represents the standard electrode potential.

In the net reaction, three equivalents of water are converted into one equivalent of ozone and three equivalents of hydrogen. Oxygen formation is a competing reaction.

It can also be generated by a high voltage arc. In its simplest form, high voltage AC, such as the output of a neon-sign transformer is connected to two metal rods with the ends placed sufficiently close to each other to allow an arc. The resulting arc will convert atmospheric oxygen to ozone.

It is often desirable to contain the ozone. This can be done with an apparatus consisting of two concentric glass tubes sealed together at the top with gas ports at the top and bottom of the outer tube. The inner core should have a length of metal foil inserted into it connected to one side of the power source. The other side of the power source should be connected to another piece of foil wrapped around the outer tube. A source of dry is applied to the bottom port. When high voltage is applied to the foil leads, electricity will discharge between the dry dioxygen in the middle and form and which will flow out the top port. This is called a Siemen&#x27;s ozoniser. The reaction can be summarized as follows:
: &lt;chem&gt;3O2 -&gt;[\text{electricity}] 2O3&lt;/chem&gt;

==Applications==

===Industry===
The largest use of ozone is in the preparation of pharmaceuticals, synthetic lubricants, and many other commercially useful organic compounds, where it is used to sever carbon-carbon bonds. It can also be used for bleaching substances and for killing microorganisms in air and water sources. Many municipal drinking water systems kill bacteria with ozone instead of the more common chlorine. Ozone has a very high oxidation potential. Ozone does not form organochlorine compounds, nor does it remain in the water after treatment. Ozone can form the suspected carcinogen bromate in source water with high bromide concentrations. The U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act mandates that these systems introduce an amount of chlorine to maintain a minimum of 0.2 μmol/mol residual free chlorine in the pipes, based on results of regular testing. Where electrical power is abundant, ozone is a cost-effective method of treating water, since it is produced on demand and does not require transportation and storage of hazardous chemicals. Once it has decayed, it leaves no taste or odour in drinking water.

Although low levels of ozone have been advertised to be of some disinfectant use in residential homes, the concentration of ozone in dry air required to have a rapid, substantial effect on airborne pathogens exceeds safe levels recommended by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Environmental Protection Agency. Humidity control can vastly improve both the killing power of the ozone and the rate at which it decays back to oxygen (more humidity allows more effectiveness). Spore forms of most pathogens are very tolerant of atmospheric ozone in concentrations at which asthma patients start to have issues.

In 1908 artificial ozonisation of the Central Line of the London Underground was introduced for aerial disinfection. The process was found to be worthwhile, but was phased out by 1956. However the beneficial effect was maintained by the ozone created incidentally from the electrical discharges of the train motors (see above: Incidental production).

Ozone generators were made available to schools and universities in Wales for the Autumn term 2021, to disinfect classrooms after COVID-19 outbreaks.

Industrially, ozone is used to:
* Disinfect laundry in hospitals, food factories, care homes, etc.
* Disinfect water in place of chlorine
* Deodorize air and objects, such as after a fire. This process is extensively used in fabric restoration.
* Kill bacteria on food or on contact surfaces
* Water intense industries such as breweries and dairy plants can make effective use of dissolved ozone as a replacement for chemical sanitizers such as peracetic acid, hypochlorite or heat.
* Disinfect cooling towers and control Legionella with reduced chemical consumption and water bleed-off, and increased performance.
* Sanitize swimming pools and spas
* Kill insects in stored grain
* Scrub yeast and mold spores from the air in food processing plants
* Wash fresh fruits and vegetables to kill yeast, mold, and bacteria
* Chemically attack contaminants in water (iron, arsenic, hydrogen sulfide, nitrites, and complex organics lumped together as &quot;colour&quot;)
* Provide an aid to flocculation (agglomeration of molecules, which aids in filtration, where the iron and arsenic are removed);
* Manufacture chemical compounds via chemical synthesis
* Clean and bleach fabrics (the former use is utilized in fabric restoration; the latter use is patented)
* Act as an antichlor in chlorine-based bleaching
* Assist in processing plastics to allow adhesion of inks
* Age rubber samples to determine the useful life of a batch of rubber
* Eradicate water-borne parasites such as &quot;Giardia lamblia&quot; and &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; in surface water treatment plants.

Ozone is a reagent in many organic reactions in the laboratory and in industry. Ozonolysis is the cleavage of an alkene to carbonyl compounds.

Many hospitals around the world use large ozone generators to decontaminate operating rooms between surgeries. The rooms are cleaned and then sealed airtight before being filled with ozone which effectively kills or neutralizes all remaining bacteria.

Ozone is used as an alternative to chlorine or chlorine dioxide in the bleaching of wood pulp. It is often used in conjunction with oxygen and hydrogen peroxide to eliminate the need for chlorine-containing compounds in the manufacture of high-quality, white paper.

Ozone can be used to detoxify cyanide wastes (for example from gold and silver mining) by oxidizing cyanide to cyanate and eventually to carbon dioxide.

===Water disinfection===
Since the invention of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactors, it has been employed for water treatment with ozone. However, with cheaper alternative disinfectants like chlorine, such applications of DBD ozone water decontamination have been limited by high power consumption and bulky equipment. Despite this, with research revealing the negative impacts of common disinfectants like chlorine with respect to toxic residuals and ineffectiveness in killing certain micro-organisms, DBD plasma-based ozone decontamination is of interest in current available technologies. Although ozonation of water with a high concentration of bromide does lead to the formation of undesirable brominated disinfection byproducts, unless drinking water is produced by desalination, ozonation can generally be applied without concern for these byproducts. Advantages of ozone include high thermodynamic oxidation potential, less sensitivity to organic material and better tolerance for pH variations while retaining the ability to kill bacteria, fungi, viruses, as well as spores and cysts. Although, ozone has been widely accepted in Europe for decades, it is sparingly used for decontamination in the U.S. due to limitations of high-power consumption, bulky installation and stigma attached with ozone toxicity. Considering this, recent research efforts have been directed toward the study of effective ozone water treatment systems. Researchers have looked into lightweight and compact low power surface DBD reactors, energy efficient volume DBD reactors and low power micro-scale DBD reactors. Such studies can help pave the path to re-acceptance of DBD plasma-based ozone decontamination of water, especially in the U.S.

===Consumers===
Ozone levels which are safe for people are ineffective at killing fungi and bacteria. Some consumer disinfection and cosmetic products emit ozone at levels harmful to human health.

Devices generating high levels of ozone, some of which use ionization, are used to sanitize and deodorize uninhabited buildings, rooms, ductwork, woodsheds, boats, and other vehicles.

Ozonated water is used to launder clothes and to sanitize food, drinking water, and surfaces in the home. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it is &quot;amending the food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of ozone in gaseous and aqueous phases as an antimicrobial agent on food, including meat and poultry.&quot; Studies at California Polytechnic University demonstrated that 0.3 μmol/mol levels of ozone dissolved in filtered tapwater can produce a reduction of more than 99.99% in such food-borne microorganisms as salmonella, &quot;E. coli&quot; 0157:H7 and &quot;Campylobacter&quot;. This quantity is 20,000 times the WHO-recommended limits stated above.

Ozone can be used to remove pesticide residues from fruits and vegetables.

Ozone is used in homes and hot tubs to kill bacteria in the water and to reduce the amount of chlorine or bromine required by reactivating them to their free state. Since ozone does not remain in the water long enough, ozone by itself is ineffective at preventing cross-contamination among bathers and must be used in conjunction with halogens. Gaseous ozone created by ultraviolet light or by corona discharge is injected into the water.

Ozone is also widely used in the treatment of water in aquariums and fishponds. Its use can minimize bacterial growth, control parasites, eliminate transmission of some diseases, and reduce or eliminate &quot;yellowing&quot; of the water. Ozone must not come in contact with fishes&#x27; gill structures. Natural saltwater (with life forms) provides enough &quot;instantaneous demand&quot; that controlled amounts of ozone activate bromide ions to hypobromous acid, and the ozone entirely decays in a few seconds to minutes. If oxygen-fed ozone is used, the water will be higher in dissolved oxygen and fishes&#x27; gill structures will atrophy, making them dependent on oxygen-enriched water.

===Aquaculture===

Ozonation – a process of infusing water with ozone – can be used in aquaculture to facilitate organic breakdown. Ozone is also added to recirculating systems to reduce nitrite levels through conversion into nitrate. If nitrite levels in the water are high, nitrites will also accumulate in the blood and tissues of fish, where it interferes with oxygen transport (it causes oxidation of the heme-group of haemoglobin from ferrous () to ferric (), making haemoglobin unable to bind ). Despite these apparent positive effects, ozone use in recirculation systems has been linked to reducing the level of bioavailable iodine in salt water systems, resulting in iodine deficiency symptoms such as goitre and decreased growth in Senegalese sole (&quot;Solea senegalensis&quot;) larvae.

Ozonate seawater is used for surface disinfection of haddock and Atlantic halibut eggs against nodavirus. Nodavirus is a lethal and vertically transmitted virus which causes severe mortality in fish. Haddock eggs should not be treated with high ozone level as eggs so treated did not hatch and died after 3–4 days.

===Agriculture===
Ozone application on freshly cut pineapple and banana shows increase in flavonoids and total phenol contents when exposure is up to 20 minutes. Decrease in ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) content is observed but the positive effect on total phenol content and flavonoids can overcome the negative effect. Tomatoes upon treatment with ozone show an increase in β-carotene, lutein and lycopene. However, ozone application on strawberries in pre-harvest period shows decrease in ascorbic acid content.

Ozone facilitates the extraction of some heavy metals from soil using EDTA. EDTA forms strong, water-soluble coordination compounds with some heavy metals (Pb and Zn) thereby making it possible to dissolve them out from contaminated soil. If contaminated soil is pre-treated with ozone, the extraction efficacy of Pb, Am, and Pu increases by 11.0–28.9%, 43.5% and 50.7% respectively.

===Effect on pollinators===
Crop pollination is an essential part of an ecosystem. Ozone can have detrimental effects on plant-pollinator interactions. Pollinators carry pollen from one plant to another. This is an essential cycle inside of an ecosystem. Causing changes in certain atmospheric conditions around pollination sites or with xenobiotics could cause unknown changes to the natural cycles of pollinators and flowering plants. In a study conducted in North-Western Europe, crop pollinators were negatively affected more when ozone levels were higher.

===Alternative medicine===

The use of ozone for the treatment of medical conditions is not supported by high quality evidence, and is generally considered alternative medicine.

<text>Orchids are plants that belong to the family Orchidaceae (), a diverse and widespread group of flowering plants with blooms that are often colourful and fragrant. Orchids are cosmopolitan plants that are found in almost every habitat on Earth except glaciers. The world&#x27;s richest diversity of orchid genera and species is found in the tropics.

Orchidaceae is one of the two largest families of flowering plants, along with the Asteraceae. It contains about 28,000 currently accepted species in 702 genera.

The Orchidaceae family encompasses about 6–11% of all species of seed plants. The largest genera are &quot;Bulbophyllum&quot; (2,000 species), &quot;Epidendrum&quot; (1,500 species), &quot;Dendrobium&quot; (1,400 species) and &quot;Pleurothallis&quot; (1,000 species). It also includes &quot;Vanilla&quot; (the genus of the vanilla plant), the type genus &quot;Orchis&quot;, and many commonly cultivated plants such as &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; and &quot;Cattleya&quot;. Moreover, since the introduction of tropical species into cultivation in the 19th century, horticulturists have produced many hybrids and cultivars.

== Description ==
Orchids are easily distinguished from other plants, as they share some very evident derived characteristics or synapomorphies. Among these are: bilateral symmetry of the flower (zygomorphism), many resupinate flowers, a nearly always highly modified petal (labellum), fused stamens and carpels, and extremely small seeds.

=== Stem and roots ===

All orchids are perennial herbs that lack any permanent woody structure. They can grow according to two patterns:
* Monopodial: The stem grows from a single bud, leaves are added from the apex each year, and the stem grows longer accordingly. The stem of orchids with a monopodial growth can reach several metres in length, as in &quot;Vanda&quot; and &quot;Vanilla&quot;.
* Sympodial: Sympodial orchids have a front (the newest growth) and a back (the oldest growth). The plant produces a series of adjacent shoots, which grow to a certain size, bloom and then stop growing and are replaced. Sympodial orchids grow horizontally, rather than vertically, following the surface of their support. The growth continues by development of new leads, with their own leaves and roots, sprouting from or next to those of the previous year, as in &quot;Cattleya&quot;. While a new lead is developing, the rhizome may start its growth again from a so-called &#x27;eye&#x27;, an undeveloped bud, thereby branching. Sympodial orchids may have visible pseudobulbs joined by a &quot;rhizome&quot;, which creeps along the top or just beneath the soil.

Terrestrial orchids may be rhizomatous or form corms or tubers. The root caps of terrestrial orchids are smooth and white.

Some sympodial terrestrial orchids, such as &quot;Orchis&quot; and &quot;Ophrys&quot;, have two subterranean tuberous roots. One is used as a food reserve for wintry periods, and provides for the development of the other one, from which visible growth develops.

In warm and constantly humid climates, many terrestrial orchids do not need pseudobulbs.

Epiphytic orchids, those that grow upon a support, have modified aerial roots that can sometimes be a few meters long. In the older parts of the roots, a modified spongy epidermis, called a velamen, has the function of absorbing humidity. It is made of dead cells and can have a silvery-grey, white or brown appearance. In some orchids, the velamen includes spongy and fibrous bodies near the passage cells, called tilosomes.

The cells of the root epidermis grow at a right angle to the axis of the root to allow them to get a firm grasp on their support. Nutrients for epiphytic orchids mainly come from mineral dust, organic detritus, animal droppings and other substances collecting among on their supporting surfaces.
The base of the stem of sympodial epiphytes, or in some species essentially the entire stem, may be thickened to form a pseudobulb that contains nutrients and water for drier periods.

The pseudobulb typically has a smooth surface with lengthwise grooves, and can have different shapes, often conical or oblong. Its size is very variable; in some small species of &quot;Bulbophyllum&quot;, it is no longer than two millimeters, while in the largest orchid in the world, &quot;Grammatophyllum speciosum&quot; (giant orchid), it can reach three meters. Some &quot;Dendrobium&quot; species have long, canelike pseudobulbs with short, rounded leaves over the whole length; some other orchids have hidden or extremely small pseudobulbs, completely included inside the leaves.

With ageing the pseudobulb sheds its leaves and becomes dormant. At this stage it is often called a backbulb. Backbulbs still hold nutrition for the plant, but then a pseudobulb usually takes over, exploiting the last reserves accumulated in the backbulb, which eventually dies off, too. A pseudobulb typically lives for about five years. Orchids without noticeable pseudobulbs are also said to have growths, an individual component of a sympodial plant.

=== Leaves ===

Like most monocots, orchids generally have simple leaves with parallel veins, although some Vanilloideae have reticulate venation. Leaves may be ovate, lanceolate, or orbiculate, and very variable in size on the individual plant. Their characteristics are often diagnostic. They are normally alternate on the stem, often folded lengthwise along the centre (&quot;plicate&quot;), and have no stipules. Orchid leaves often have siliceous bodies called stegmata in the vascular bundle sheaths (not present in the Orchidoideae) and are fibrous.

The structure of the leaves corresponds to the specific habitat of the plant. Species that typically bask in sunlight, or grow on sites which can be occasionally very dry, have thick, leathery leaves and the laminae are covered by a waxy cuticle to retain their necessary water supply. Shade-loving species, on the other hand, have long, thin leaves.

The leaves of most orchids are perennial, that is, they live for several years, while others, especially those with plicate leaves as in &quot;Catasetum&quot;, shed them annually and develop new leaves together with new pseudobulbs.

The leaves of some orchids are considered ornamental. The leaves of &quot;Macodes sanderiana&quot;, a semiterrestrial or rock-hugging (&quot;lithophyte&quot;) orchid, show a sparkling silver and gold veining on a light green background. The cordate leaves of &quot;Psychopsiella limminghei&quot; are light brownish-green with maroon-puce markings, created by flower pigments. The attractive mottle of the leaves of lady&#x27;s slippers from tropical and subtropical Asia (&quot;Paphiopedilum&quot;), is caused by uneven distribution of chlorophyll. Also, &quot;Phalaenopsis schilleriana&quot; is a pastel pink orchid with leaves spotted dark green and light green. The jewel orchid (&quot;Ludisia discolor&quot;) is grown more for its colorful leaves than its white flowers.

Some orchids, such as &quot;Dendrophylax lindenii&quot; (ghost orchid), &quot;Aphyllorchis&quot; and &quot;Taeniophyllum&quot; depend on their green roots for photosynthesis and lack normally developed leaves, as do all of the heterotrophic species.

Orchids of the genus &quot;Corallorhiza&quot; (coralroot orchids) lack leaves altogether and instead have symbiotic or parasitic associations with fungal mycelium, though which they absorb sugars.

=== Flowers ===
Orchid flowers have three sepals, three petals and a three-chambered ovary. The three sepals and two of the petals are often similar to each other but one petal is usually highly modified, forming a &quot;lip&quot; or labellum. In most orchid genera, as the flower develops, it undergoes a twisting through 180°, called resupination, so that the labellum lies below the column. The labellum functions to attract insects, and in resupinate flowers, also acts as a landing stage, or sometimes a trap.
The reproductive parts of an orchid flower are unique in that the stamens and style are joined to form a single structure, the column. Instead of being released singly, thousands of pollen grains are contained in one or two bundles called pollinia that are attached to a sticky disc near the top of the column. Just below the pollinia is a second, larger sticky plate called the stigma.

==Reproduction==
=== Pollination ===

The complex mechanisms that orchids have evolved to achieve cross-pollination were investigated by Charles Darwin and described in &quot;Fertilisation of Orchids&quot; (1862). Orchids have developed highly specialized pollination systems, thus the chances of being pollinated are often scarce, so orchid flowers usually remain receptive for very long periods, rendering unpollinated flowers long-lasting in cultivation. Most orchids deliver pollen in a single mass. Each time pollination succeeds, thousands of ovules can be fertilized.

Pollinators are often visually attracted by the shape and colours of the labellum. However, some &quot;Bulbophyllum&quot; species attract male fruit flies (&quot;Bactrocera&quot; and &quot;Zeugodacus&quot; spp.) solely via a floral chemical which simultaneously acts as a floral reward (e.g. methyl eugenol, raspberry ketone, or zingerone) to perform pollination. The flowers may produce attractive odours. Although absent in most species, nectar may be produced in a spur of the labellum (8 in the illustration above), or on the point of the sepals, or in the septa of the ovary, the most typical position amongst the Asparagales.

In orchids that produce pollinia, pollination happens as some variant of the following sequence: when the pollinator enters into the flower, it touches a viscidium, which promptly sticks to its body, generally on the head or abdomen. While leaving the flower, it pulls the pollinium out of the anther, as it is connected to the viscidium by the caudicle or stipe. The caudicle then bends and the pollinium is moved forwards and downwards. When the pollinator enters another flower of the same species, the pollinium has taken such position that it will stick to the stigma of the second flower, just below the rostellum, pollinating it. In horticulture, artificial orchid pollination is achieved by removing the pollinia with a small instrument such as a toothpick from the pollen parent and transferring them to the seed parent.

Some orchids mainly or totally rely on self-pollination, especially in colder regions where pollinators are particularly rare. The caudicles may dry up if the flower has not been visited by any pollinator, and the pollinia then fall directly on the stigma. Otherwise, the anther may rotate and then enter the stigma cavity of the flower (as in &quot;Holcoglossum amesianum&quot;).

The slipper orchid &quot;Paphiopedilum parishii&quot; reproduces by self-fertilization. This occurs when the anther changes from a solid to a liquid state and directly contacts the stigma surface without the aid of any pollinating agent or floral assembly.

The labellum of the Cypripedioideae is poke bonnet-shaped, and has the function of trapping visiting insects. The only exit leads to the anthers that deposit pollen on the visitor.

In some extremely specialized orchids, such as the Eurasian genus &quot;Ophrys&quot;, the labellum is adapted to have a colour, shape, and odour which attracts male insects via mimicry of a receptive female. Pollination happens as the insect attempts to mate with flowers.

Many neotropical orchids are pollinated by male orchid bees, which visit the flowers to gather volatile chemicals they require to synthesize pheromonal attractants. Males of such species as &quot;Euglossa imperialis&quot; or &quot;Eulaema meriana&quot; have been observed to leave their territories periodically to forage for aromatic compounds, such as cineole, to synthesize pheromone for attracting and mating with females. Each type of orchid places the pollinia on a different body part of a different species of bee, so as to enforce proper cross-pollination.

A rare saprophytic orchid growing entirely underground in Australia, &quot;Rhizanthella slateri&quot;, is never exposed to light, and depends on ants and other terrestrial insects to pollinate it.

&quot;Catasetum&quot;, a genus discussed briefly by Darwin, actually launches its viscid pollinia with explosive force when an insect touches a seta, knocking the pollinator off the flower.

After pollination, the sepals and petals fade and wilt, but they usually remain attached to the ovary.

In 2011, &quot;Bulbophyllum nocturnum&quot; was discovered to flower nocturnally.

=== Asexual reproduction ===
Some species, such as in the genera &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot;, &quot;Dendrobium&quot;, and &quot;Vanda&quot;, produce offshoots or plantlets formed from one of the nodes along the stem, through the accumulation of growth hormones at that point. These shoots are known as keiki.

&quot;Epipogium aphyllum&quot; exhibits a dual reproductive strategy, engaging in both sexual and asexual seed production. The likelihood of apomixis playing a substantial role in successful reproduction appears minimal. Within certain petite orchid species groups, there is a noteworthy preparation of female gametes for fertilization preceding the act of pollination.

=== Fruits and seeds ===

The ovary typically develops into a capsule that is dehiscent by three or six longitudinal slits, while remaining closed at both ends.

The seeds are generally almost microscopic and very numerous, in some species over a million per capsule. After ripening, they blow off like dust particles or spores. Most orchid species lack endosperm in their seed and must enter symbiotic relationships with various mycorrhizal basidiomyceteous fungi that provide them the necessary nutrients to germinate, so almost all orchid species are mycoheterotrophic during germination and reliant upon fungi to complete their lifecycles. Only a handful of orchid species have seed that can germinate without mycorrhiza, namely the species within the genus &quot;Disa&quot; with hydrochorous seeds.

As the chance for a seed to meet a suitable fungus is very small, only a minute fraction of all the seeds released grow into adult plants. In cultivation, germination typically takes weeks.

Horticultural techniques have been devised for germinating orchid seeds on an artificial nutrient medium, eliminating the requirement of the fungus for germination and greatly aiding the propagation of ornamental orchids. The usual medium for the sowing of orchids in artificial conditions is agar gel combined with a carbohydrate energy source. The carbohydrate source can be combinations of discrete sugars or can be derived from other sources such as banana, pineapple, peach, or even tomato puree or coconut water. After the preparation of the agar medium, it is poured into test tubes or jars which are then autoclaved (or cooked in a pressure cooker) to sterilize the medium. After cooking, the medium begins to gel as it cools.

== Taxonomy ==
The taxonomy of this family is in constant flux, as new studies continue to clarify the relationships between species and groups of species, allowing more taxa at several ranks to be recognized. The Orchidaceae is currently placed in the order Asparagales by the APG III system of 2009.

Five subfamilies are recognised. The cladogram below was made according to the APG system of 1998. It represents the view that most botanists had held up to that time. It was supported by morphological studies, but never received strong support in molecular phylogenetic studies.

In 2015, a phylogenetic study showed strong statistical support for the following topology of the orchid tree, using 9 kb of plastid and nuclear DNA from 7 genes, a topology that was confirmed by a phylogenomic study in the same year.

=== Evolution ===
It has been hypothesised that the origin of the orchids goes back much longer than originally expected. An extinct species of stingless bee, &quot;Proplebeia dominicana&quot;, was found trapped in Miocene amber from about 15–20 million years ago. The bee was carrying pollen of a previously unknown orchid taxon, &quot;Meliorchis caribea&quot;, on its wings. This find is the first evidence of fossilised orchids to date and shows insects were active pollinators of orchids then. This extinct orchid, &quot;M. caribea&quot;, has been placed within the extant tribe Cranichideae, subtribe Goodyerinae (subfamily Orchidoideae). An even older orchid species, &quot;Succinanthera baltica&quot;, was described from the Eocene Baltic amber by Poinar &amp; Rasmussen (2017).

Genetic sequencing indicates orchids may have arisen earlier, 76 to 84 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous. According to Mark W. Chase &quot;et al.&quot; (2001), the overall biogeography and phylogenetic patterns of Orchidaceae show they are even older and may go back roughly 100 million years.

Using the molecular clock method, it was possible to determine the age of the major branches of the orchid family. This also confirmed that the subfamily Vanilloideae is a branch at the basal dichotomy of the monandrous orchids, and must have evolved very early in the evolution of the family. Since this subfamily occurs worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions, from tropical America to tropical Asia, New Guinea and West Africa, and the continents began to split about 100 million years ago, significant biotic exchange must have occurred after this split (since the age of &quot;Vanilla&quot; is estimated at 60 to 70 million years). Recent biogeographic studies conducted on densely sampled phylogenies indicated that the most recent common ancestor of all extant orchids probably originated somewhere 83 million years ago in the supercontinent Laurasia. Despite their long evolutionary history on Earth, the extant orchid diversity is also inferred to have originated during the last 5 million years, with the American and Asian tropics as the geographic areas exhibiting the highest speciation rates (i.e., number of speciation events per million years) on Earth.

Genome duplication occurred prior to the divergence of this taxon.

=== Etymology ===

The type genus (i.e. the genus after which the family is named) is &quot;Orchis&quot;. The genus name comes from the Ancient Greek (&quot;&quot;), literally meaning &quot;testicle&quot;, because of the shape of the twin tubers in some species of &quot;Orchis&quot;. The term &quot;orchid&quot; was introduced in 1845 by John Lindley in &quot;School Botany&quot;, as a shortened form of &quot;Orchidaceae&quot;.

In Middle English, the name &quot;bollockwort&quot; was used for some orchids, based on &quot;&quot; meaning testicle and &quot;&quot; meaning plant.

=== Hybrids ===
Orchid species hybridize readily in cultivation, leading to a large number of hybrids with complex naming. Hybridization is possible across genera, and therefore many cultivated orchids are placed into nothogenera. For instance, the nothogenus × &quot;Brassocattleya&quot; is used for all hybrids of species from the genera &quot;Brassavola&quot; and &quot;Cattleya&quot;. Nothogenera based on at least three genera may have names based on a person&#x27;s name with the suffix &quot;&quot;, for instance × &quot;Colmanara&quot; = &quot;Miltonia&quot; × &quot;Odontoglossum&quot; × &quot;Oncidium&quot;. (The suffix is obligatory starting at four genera.)

Cultivated hybrids in the orchid family are also special in that they are named by using grex nomenclature, rather than nothospecies. For instance, hybrids between &quot;Brassavola nodosa&quot; and &quot;Brassavola acaulis&quot; are placed in the grex &quot;Brassavola&quot; Guiseppi. The name of the grex (&quot;Guiseppi&quot; in this example) is written in a non-italic font without quotes.

=== Abbreviations ===
As a unique feature of the orchid family, a system of abbreviations exists that applies to names of genera and nothogenera. The system is maintained by the Royal Horticultural Society. These abbreviations consist of at least one character, but may be longer. As opposed to the usual one-letter abbreviations used for names of genera, orchid abbreviations uniquely determine the (notho)genus. They are widely used in cultivation. Examples are &quot;Phal&quot; for &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot;, &quot;V&quot; for &quot;Vanda&quot; and &quot;Cleis&quot; for &quot;Cleisostoma&quot;.

== Distribution ==
Orchidaceae are cosmopolitan, occurring in almost every habitat apart from glaciers. The world&#x27;s richest diversity of orchid genera and species is found in the tropics, but they are also found above the Arctic Circle, in southern Patagonia, and two species of &quot;Nematoceras&quot; on Macquarie Island at 54° south.

The following list gives a rough overview of their distribution:
* Oceania: 50 to 70 genera
* North America: 20 to 26 genera
* tropical America: 212 to 250 genera
* tropical Asia: 260 to 300 genera
* tropical Africa: 230 to 270 genera
* Europe and temperate Asia: 40 to 60 genera

== Ecology ==

A majority of orchids are perennial epiphytes, which grow anchored to trees or shrubs in the tropics and subtropics. Species such as &quot;Angraecum sororium&quot; are lithophytes, growing on rocks or very rocky soil. Other orchids (including the majority of temperate Orchidaceae) are terrestrial and can be found in habitat areas such as grasslands or forest.

Some orchids, such as &quot;Neottia&quot; and &quot;Corallorhiza&quot;, lack chlorophyll, so are unable to photosynthesise. Instead, these species obtain energy and nutrients by parasitising soil fungi through the formation of orchid mycorrhizae. The fungi involved include those that form ectomycorrhizas with trees and other woody plants, parasites such as &quot;Armillaria&quot;, and saprotrophs. These orchids are known as myco-heterotrophs, but were formerly (incorrectly) described as saprophytes as it was believed they gained their nutrition by breaking down organic matter. While only a few species are achlorophyllous holoparasites, all orchids are myco-heterotrophic during germination and seedling growth, and even photosynthetic adult plants may continue to obtain carbon from their mycorrhizal fungi. The symbiosis is typically maintained throughout the lifetime of the orchid because they depend on the fungus for nutrients, sugars and minerals.

== Uses ==

=== Perfumery ===
The scent of orchids is frequently analysed by perfumers (using headspace technology and gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry) to identify potential fragrance chemicals.

=== Horticulture ===
The other important use of orchids is their cultivation for the enjoyment of the flowers. Most cultivated orchids are tropical or subtropical, but quite a few that grow in colder climates can be found on the market. Temperate species available at nurseries include &quot;Ophrys apifera&quot; (bee orchid), &quot;Gymnadenia conopsea&quot; (fragrant orchid), &quot;Anacamptis pyramidalis&quot; (pyramidal orchid) and &quot;Dactylorhiza fuchsii&quot; (common spotted orchid).

Orchids of all types have also often been sought by collectors of both species and hybrids. Many hundreds of societies and clubs worldwide have been established. These can be small, local clubs, or larger, national organisations such as the American Orchid Society. Both serve to encourage cultivation and collection of orchids, but some go further by concentrating on conservation or research.

The term &quot;botanical orchid&quot; loosely denotes those small-flowered, tropical orchids belonging to several genera that do not fit into the &quot;florist&quot; orchid category. A few of these genera contain enormous numbers of species. Some, such as &quot;Pleurothallis&quot; and &quot;Bulbophyllum&quot;, contain approximately 1700 and 2000 species, respectively, and are often extremely vegetatively diverse. The primary use of the term is among orchid hobbyists wishing to describe unusual species they grow, though it is also used to distinguish naturally occurring orchid species from horticulturally created hybrids.

New orchids are registered with the International Orchid Register, maintained by the Royal Horticultural Society. Several thousand new grexes are registered each year.

=== Food ===


The dried seed pods of one orchid genus, &quot;Vanilla&quot; (especially &quot;Vanilla planifolia&quot;), are commercially important as a flavouring in baking, for perfume manufacture and aromatherapy.

The underground tubers of terrestrial orchids [mainly &quot;Orchis mascula&quot; (early purple orchid)] are ground to a powder and used for cooking, such as in the hot beverage &quot;salep&quot; or in the Turkish mastic ice cream &quot;dondurma&quot;. The name &quot;salep&quot; has been claimed to come from the Arabic expression &#x27;, &quot;fox testicles&quot;, but it appears more likely the name comes directly from the Arabic name &#x27;. The similarity in appearance to testes naturally accounts for &quot;salep&quot; being considered an aphrodisiac.

The dried leaves of &quot;Jumellea fragrans&quot; are used to flavour rum on Reunion Island.

Some saprophytic orchid species of the group &quot;Gastrodia&quot; produce potato-like tubers and were consumed as food by native peoples in Australia and can be successfully cultivated, notably &quot;Gastrodia sesamoides&quot;. Wild stands of these plants can still be found in the same areas as early Aboriginal settlements, such as Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park in Australia. Aboriginal peoples located the plants in habitat by observing where bandicoots had scratched in search of the tubers after detecting the plants underground by scent.

== Cultural symbolism ==
Orchids have many associations with symbolic values. For example, the orchid is the City Flower of Shaoxing, China. &quot;Cattleya mossiae&quot; is the national Venezuelan flower, while &quot;Cattleya trianae&quot; is the national flower of Colombia. &quot;Vanda&quot; Miss Joaquim is the national flower of Singapore, &quot;Guarianthe skinneri&quot; is the national flower of Costa Rica and &quot;Rhyncholaelia digbyana&quot; is the national flower of Honduras. &quot;Prosthechea cochleata&quot; is the national flower of Belize, where it is known as the &quot;black orchid&quot;. &quot;Lycaste skinneri&quot; has a white variety (alba) that is the national flower of Guatemala, commonly known as &quot;Monja Blanca&quot; (White Nun). Panama&#x27;s national flower is the &quot;Holy Ghost orchid&quot; (&quot;Peristeria elata&quot;), or &#x27;the flor del Espiritu Santo&#x27;. &quot;Rhynchostylis&quot; &quot;retusa&quot; is the state flower of the Indian state of Assam where it is known as &quot;Kopou Phul.&quot;

Orchids native to the Mediterranean are depicted on the &quot;Ara Pacis&quot; in Rome, until now the only known instance of orchids in ancient art, and the earliest in European art. A French writer and agronomist, Louis Liger, invented a classical myth in his book &quot;Le Jardinier Fleuriste et Historiographe&quot; published in 1704, attributing it to the ancient Greeks and Romans, in which Orchis the son of a nymph and a satyr rapes a priestess of Bacchus during one of his festivals the Bacchanalia and is then killed and transformed into an orchid flower as punishment by the gods, paralleling the various myths of youths dying and becoming flowers, like Adonis and Narcissus; this myth however does not appear any earlier than Liger, and is not part of traditional Greek and Roman mythologies.

==Conservation==
Almost all orchids are included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), meaning that international trade (including in their parts/derivatives) is regulated by the CITES permit system. A smaller number of orchids such as &quot;Paphiopedilum&quot; sp. are listed in CITES Appendix I meaning that commercial international trade in wild-sourced specimens is prohibited and all other trade is strictly controlled.

=== Assisted migration as conservation tool ===
In 2006 the Longtan Dam was constructed at the Hongshui River, near the Yachang Orchid Nature Reserve. In response to threats of inundation of wild orchids at lower altitudes (350–400 m above sea level), 1000 endangered orchid plants of 16 genera and 29 species were translocated to higher elevation (approximately 1000 m above sea level). After relocation the 5 year survival of low and wide elevation species did not significantly differ and the mortality due to transplant shock was at only 10%. From this it was concluded that assisted migration might be a viable conservation tool for orchid species endangered by climate change.

=== Toxicity ===
Plants in the genus &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; are not toxic to pets, according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

<text>Obsidian ( ) is a naturally occurring volcanic glass formed when lava extruded from a volcano cools rapidly with minimal crystal growth. It is an igneous rock. Produced from felsic lava, obsidian is rich in the lighter elements such as silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, and potassium. It is commonly found within the margins of rhyolitic lava flows known as obsidian flows. These flows have a high content of silica, giving them a high viscosity. The high viscosity inhibits diffusion of atoms through the lava, which inhibits the first step (nucleation) in the formation of mineral crystals. Together with rapid cooling, this results in a natural glass forming from the lava.

Obsidian is hard, brittle, and amorphous; it therefore fractures with sharp edges. In the past, it was used to manufacture cutting and piercing tools, and it has been used experimentally as surgical scalpel blades.

==Origin and properties==

The &quot;Natural History&quot; by the Roman writer Pliny the Elder includes a few sentences about a volcanic glass called obsidian (&quot;lapis obsidianus&quot;), discovered in Ethiopia by Obsidius, a Roman explorer.

Obsidian is formed from quickly cooled lava. Extrusive formation of obsidian may occur when felsic lava cools rapidly at the edges of a felsic lava flow or volcanic dome, or when lava cools during sudden contact with water or air. Intrusive formation of obsidian may occur when felsic lava cools along the edges of a dike.

Tektites were once thought by many to be obsidian produced by lunar volcanic eruptions, though few scientists now adhere to this hypothesis.

Obsidian is mineral-like, but not a true mineral because, as a glass, it is not crystalline; in addition, its composition is too variable to be classified as a mineral. It is sometimes classified as a mineraloid. Though obsidian is usually dark in color, similar to mafic rocks such as basalt, the composition of obsidian is extremely felsic. Obsidian consists mainly of SiO2 (silicon dioxide), usually 70% by weight or more; the remainder consists of variable amounts of other oxides, mostly oxides of aluminium, iron, potassium, sodium and calcium. Crystalline rocks with a similar composition include granite and rhyolite. Because obsidian is metastable at the Earth&#x27;s surface (over time the glass devitrifies, becoming fine-grained mineral crystals), obsidian older than Miocene in age is rare. Exceptionally old obsidians include a Cretaceous welded tuff and a partially devitrified Ordovician perlite. This transformation of obsidian is accelerated by the presence of water. Although newly formed obsidian has a low water content, typically less than 1% water by weight, it becomes progressively hydrated when exposed to groundwater, forming perlite.

Pure obsidian is usually dark in appearance, though the color varies depending on the impurities present. Iron and other transition elements may give the obsidian a dark brown to black color. Most black obsidians contain nanoinclusions of magnetite, an iron oxide. Very few samples of obsidian are nearly colorless. In some stones, the inclusion of small, white, radially clustered crystals (spherulites) of the mineral cristobalite in the black glass produce a blotchy or snowflake pattern (&quot;snowflake obsidian&quot;). Obsidian may contain patterns of gas bubbles remaining from the lava flow, aligned along layers created as the molten rock was flowing before being cooled. These bubbles can produce interesting effects such as a golden sheen (&quot;sheen obsidian&quot;). An iridescent, rainbow-like sheen (&quot;fire obsidian&quot;) is caused by inclusions of magnetite nanoparticles creating thin-film interference. Colorful, striped obsidian (&quot;rainbow obsidian&quot;) from Mexico contains oriented nanorods of hedenbergite, which cause the rainbow striping effects by thin-film interference.

==Occurrence==

Obsidian is found near volcanoes in locations which have undergone rhyolitic eruptions. It can be found in Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Australia, Canada, Chile, Georgia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Greece, Guatemala, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Russia, Scotland, the Canary Islands, Turkey and the United States. Obsidian flows which are so large that they can be hiked on are found within the calderas of Newberry Volcano (Big Obsidian Flow, 700 acres) and Medicine Lake Volcano in the Cascade Range of western North America, and at Inyo Craters east of the Sierra Nevada in California. Yellowstone National Park has a mountainside containing obsidian located between Mammoth Hot Springs and the Norris Geyser Basin, and deposits can be found in many other western U.S. states including Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and Washington, Oregon and Idaho.

There are only four major deposit areas in the central Mediterranean: Lipari, Pantelleria, Palmarola and Monte Arci (Sardinia).

Ancient sources in the Aegean were Milos and Gyali.

Acıgöl town and the Göllü Dağ volcano were the most important sources in central Anatolia, one of the more important source areas in the prehistoric Near East.

==Prehistoric and historical use==

The first known archaeological evidence of usage was in Kariandusi (Kenya) and other sites of the Acheulian age (beginning 1.5 million years BP) dated 700,000 BC, although only very few objects have been found at these sites relative to the Neolithic. Manufacture of obsidian bladelets at Lipari had reached a high level of sophistication by the late Neolithic, and was traded as far as Sicily, the southern Po river valley, and Croatia. Obsidian bladelets were used in ritual circumcisions and cutting of umbilical cords of newborns. Anatolian sources of obsidian are known to have been the material used in the Levant and modern-day Iraqi Kurdistan from a time beginning sometime about 12,500 BC. Obsidian artifacts are common at Tell Brak, one of the earliest Mesopotamian urban centers, dating to the late fifth millennium BC. Obsidian was valued in Stone Age cultures because, like flint, it could be fractured to produce sharp blades or arrowheads in a process called knapping. Like all glass and some other naturally occurring rocks, obsidian breaks with a characteristic conchoidal fracture. It was also polished to create early mirrors. Modern archaeologists have developed a relative dating system, obsidian hydration dating, to calculate the age of obsidian artifacts.

===Europe===
Obsidian artifacts first appeared in the European continent in Central Europe in the Middle Paleolithic and had become common by the Upper Paleolithic, although there are exceptions to this. Obsidian played an important role in the transmission of Neolithic knowledge and experiences. The material was mainly used for production of chipped tools which were very sharp due to its nature. Artifacts made of obsidian can be found in many Neolithic cultures across Europe. The source of obsidian for cultures inhabiting the territory of and around Greece was the island of Milos; the Starčevo–Körös–Criș culture obtained obsidian from sources in Hungary and Slovakia, while the Cardium-Impresso cultural complex acquired obsidian from the island outcrops of the central Mediterranean. Through trade, these artifacts ended up in lands thousands of kilometers away from the original source; this indicates that they were a highly valued commodity. John Dee had a mirror, made of obsidian, which was brought from Mexico to Europe between 1527 and 1530 after Hernando Cortés&#x27;s conquest of the region.

===Middle East and Asia===

In the Ubaid in the 5th millennium BC, blades were manufactured from obsidian extracted from outcrops located in modern-day Turkey. Ancient Egyptians used obsidian imported from the eastern Mediterranean and southern Red Sea regions. Obsidian scalpels older than 2100 BC have been found in a Bronze Age settlement in Turkey. In the eastern Mediterranean area the material was used to make tools, mirrors and decorative objects.

The use of obsidian tools was present in Japan near areas of volcanic activity. Obsidian was mined during the Jōmon period.

Obsidian has also been found in Gilat, a site in the western Negev in Israel. Eight obsidian artifacts dating to the Chalcolithic Age found at this site were traced to obsidian sources in Anatolia. Neutron activation analysis (NAA) on the obsidian found at this site helped to reveal trade routes and exchange networks previously unknown.

===Americas===
Lithic analysis helps to understand pre-Hispanic groups in Mesoamerica. A careful analysis of obsidian in a culture or place can be of considerable use to reconstruct commerce, production, and distribution, and thereby understand economic, social and political aspects of a civilization. This is the case in Yaxchilán, a Maya city where even warfare implications have been studied linked with obsidian use and its debris. Another example is the archeological recovery at coastal Chumash sites in California, indicating considerable trade with the distant site of Casa Diablo Hot Springs in the Sierra Nevada.
Pre-Columbian Mesoamericans&#x27; use of obsidian was extensive and sophisticated; including carved and worked obsidian for tools and decorative objects. Mesoamericans also made a type of sword with obsidian blades mounted in a wooden body. Called a &quot;macuahuitl&quot;, the weapon could inflict terrible injuries, combining the sharp cutting edge of an obsidian blade with the ragged cut of a serrated weapon. The polearm version of this weapon was called &quot;tepoztopilli&quot;.

Obsidian mirrors were used by some Aztec priests to conjure visions and make prophecies. They were connected with Tezcatlipoca, god of obsidian and sorcery, whose name can be translated from the Nahuatl language as &#x27;Smoking Mirror&#x27;.
Indigenous people traded obsidian throughout the Americas. Each volcano and in some cases each volcanic eruption produces a distinguishable type of obsidian allowing archaeologists to use methods such as non-destructive energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence to select minor element compositions from both the artifact and geological sample to trace the origins of a particular artifact. Similar tracing techniques have also allowed obsidian in Greece to be identified as coming from Milos, Nisyros or Gyali, islands in the Aegean Sea. Obsidian cores and blades were traded great distances inland from the coast.

In Chile obsidian tools from Chaitén Volcano have been found as far away as in Chan-Chan north of the volcano, and also in sites 400 km south of it.

===Oceania===
The Lapita culture, active across a large area of the Pacific Ocean around 1000 BC, made widespread use of obsidian tools and engaged in long distance obsidian trading. The complexity of the production technique for these tools, and the care taken in their storage, may indicate that beyond their practical use they were associated with prestige or high status.

Obsidian was also used on Rapa Nui (Easter Island) for edged tools such as &quot;Mataia&quot; and the pupils of the eyes of their Moai (statues), which were encircled by rings of bird bone. Obsidian was used to inscribe the Rongorongo glyphs.

==Current use==
Obsidian can be used to make extremely sharp knives, and obsidian blades are a type of glass knife made using naturally occurring obsidian instead of manufactured glass. Obsidian is used by some surgeons for scalpel blades, although this is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use on humans. Well-crafted obsidian blades, like any glass knife, can have a cutting edge many times sharper than high-quality steel surgical scalpels: the cutting edge of the blade is only about three nanometers thick. All metal knives have a jagged, irregular blade when viewed under a strong enough microscope; however, obsidian blades are still smooth, even when examined under an electron microscope. One study found that obsidian incisions produced fewer inflammatory cells and less granulation tissue in a group of rats after seven days but the differences disappeared after twenty-one days. Don Crabtree has produced surgical obsidian blades and written articles on the subject. Obsidian scalpels may be purchased for surgical use on research animals.

The major disadvantage of obsidian blades is their brittleness compared to those made of metal, thus limiting the surgical applications for obsidian blades to a variety of specialized uses where this is not a concern.
Obsidian is also used for ornamental purposes and as a gemstone. It presents a different appearance depending on how it is cut: in one direction it is jet black, while in another it is glistening gray. &quot;Apache tears&quot; are small rounded obsidian nuggets often embedded within a grayish-white perlite matrix.

Plinths for audio turntables have been made of obsidian since the 1970s, such as the grayish-black SH-10B3 plinth by Technics.

<doc id="22722" wikidata="Q194448" url="?curid=22722" title="Otaku">
<text>is a Japanese word that describes people with consuming interests, such as anime, manga, video games, computers or other highly enthusiastic hobbies. Its contemporary use originated with a 1983 essay by Akio Nakamori in &quot;Manga Burikko&quot;.

&quot;Otaku&quot; subculture is a central theme of various anime, manga, documentaries, and academic research. The subculture began in the 1980s as changing social mentalities and the nurturing of &quot;otaku&quot; traits by Japanese schools combined with the resignation of such individuals to what was then seen as inevitably becoming social outcasts. The subculture&#x27;s birth coincided with the anime boom after the release of works such as &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, before it branched into Comic Market. 
The &quot;otaku&quot; culture could also be seen as a refuge from the &quot;nanpa&quot; culture. In 1980, around the Kabuki-chō district of Shinjuku in Tokyo, there was a boom of &quot;nyū fūzoku&quot;, or new sex services employing female college or vocational school students. The &quot;burusera&quot; boom and the compensated dating boom in the 1990s were extensions of this. In this sense, the period from 1980 to the mid-1990s was the &quot;age of sexual love&quot;. The higher the sexual love boom rose, the more people were disappointed in sexual love for not giving them that comprehensive acceptance. The advent of information technology and databases, first and foremost, enriched the means for the homeostasis of the self, that is, self-defense; and, secondly, it thereby rapidly weakened the sense that &quot;reality&quot; (or embodied communication) is more fruitful than &quot;fiction&quot; (or virtual reality). The &quot;otaku&quot; subculture grew with the expansion of the Internet and media, as more anime, video games, shows, and comics were created. The definition of subsequently became more complex, and numerous classifications of &quot;otaku&quot; emerged.

 may be used as a pejorative, with its negativity stemming from a stereotypical view of &quot;otaku&quot; as social outcasts and the media&#x27;s reporting on Tsutomu Miyazaki, &quot;The Otaku Murderer&quot;, in 1989. &quot;Otaku&quot; discrimination was particularly intense between 1989 (when a serial murder suspect was arrested) and 1996 (when the compensated dating boom was at its peak). According to studies published in 2013, the term has become less negative, and an increasing number of people now identify themselves as &quot;otaku&quot;, both in Japan and elsewhere. Out of 137,734 teens surveyed in Japan in 2013, 42.2% self-identified as a type of &quot;otaku&quot;. According to a nationwide U.S. survey conducted by Dentsu in July 2022, 34％ of American Gen-Zs (around 15 million people), acknowledged themselves as anime &quot;otaku&quot;. In 2005, the Nomura Research Institute divided &quot;otaku&quot; into twelve groups and estimated the size and market impact of each of these groups. Other institutions have split it further or focused on a single &quot;otaku&quot; interest. These publications classify distinct groups including anime, manga, camera, automobile, J-idol, and electronics otaku. In 2005, the economic impact of &quot;otaku&quot; was estimated to be as high as ¥2 trillion ( billion).

==Etymology==

 is derived from a Japanese term for another person&#x27;s house or family (, ). The word can be used metaphorically as a part of honorific speech in Japanese, as a second-person pronoun. In this usage, its literal translation is &quot;you&quot;. It is associated with some dialects of Western Japanese and with housewives, and is less direct and more distant than intimate pronouns, such as &quot;anata&quot;, and masculine pronouns, such as &quot;kimi&quot; and &quot;omae&quot;.

The origin of the pronoun&#x27;s use among 1980s manga and anime fans is unclear. Science fiction fans were using &quot;otaku&quot; to address owners of books by the late 1960s (in a sense of &quot;Do[es] [your home] own this book?&quot;). Social critic Eiji Ōtsuka posits that &quot;otaku&quot; was used because it allowed people meeting for the first time, such as at a convention, to interact from a comfortable distance. One theory posits that &quot;otaku&quot; was popularized as a pronoun by science fiction author Motoko Arai in a 1981 essay in &quot;Variety&quot; magazine, and another posits that it was popularized by fans of anime studio Gainax, some of whose founders came from Tottori Prefecture in western Japan (where &quot;otaku&quot; is commonly used). The pronoun was also used in the popular anime &quot;Macross&quot;, first aired in 1982, by the characters Hikaru Ichijyo and Lynn Minmay, who address each other as &quot;otaku&quot; until they get to know each other better.

The modern slang form, which is distinguished from the older usage by being written in hiragana (おたく), katakana (オタク or, less frequently, ヲタク) or rarely in rōmaji, first appeared in public discourse in the 1980s, through the work of humorist and essayist Akio Nakamori. His 1983 series , printed in the &quot;lolicon&quot; magazine &quot;Manga Burikko&quot;, applied the term as pejorative for &quot;unpleasant&quot; fans, attacking their supposed poor fashion sense and physical appearance in particular. Nakamori was particularly critical of &quot;manga maniacs&quot; drawn to cute girl characters, and explained his label &quot;otaku&quot; as the term of address used between junior high school kids at manga and anime conventions.

In 1989, the case of Tsutomu Miyazaki, &quot;The Otaku Murderer&quot;, brought the fandom, very negatively, to national attention. Miyazaki, who randomly chose and murdered four girls, had a collection of 5,763 video tapes, some containing anime and slasher films that were found interspersed with videos and pictures of his victims. Later that year, the contemporary knowledge magazine &quot;Bessatsu Takarajima&quot; dedicated its 104th issue to the topic of otaku. It was called and delved into the subculture of otaku with 19 articles by otaku insiders, among them Akio Nakamori. This publication has been claimed by scholar Rudyard Pesimo to have popularized the term.

==Usage==

In modern Japanese slang, the term is mostly equivalent to &quot;geek&quot; or &quot;nerd&quot; (both in the broad sense; a technological geek would be a and an academic nerd would be a or ), but in a more derogatory manner than used in the West. It is also applied to any fan of any particular theme, topic, hobby or form of entertainment. &quot;When these people are referred to as , they are judged for their behaviors — and people suddenly see an &#x27;otaku&#x27; as a person unable to relate to reality.&quot; The term thus has more of a negative association in Japanese society.

The word entered English as a loanword from the Japanese language. It is typically used to refer to a fan of anime and manga, but can also refer to Japanese video games or even Japanese culture in general. Platforms like TrackOtaku and the American magazine &quot;Otaku USA&quot; popularize and cover these aspects. The usage of the word is a source of contention among some fans, owing to its negative connotations and stereotyping of the fandom. Widespread English exposure to the term came in 1988 with the release of &quot;Gunbuster&quot;, which refers to anime fans as . &quot;Gunbuster&quot; was released officially in English in March 1990. The term&#x27;s usage spread throughout the Usenet group rec.arts.anime with discussions about &quot;Otaku no Video&quot;″s portrayal of otaku before its 1994 English release. Positive and negative aspects, including the pejorative usage, were intermixed. The term was also popularized by William Gibson&#x27;s 1996 novel &quot;Idoru&quot;, which references &quot;otaku&quot;.

==Subculture==
Kaichirō Morikawa identifies the subculture as distinctly Japanese, a product of the school system and society. Japanese schools have a class structure which functions as a caste system, but clubs are an exception to the social hierarchy. In these clubs, a student&#x27;s interests will be recognized and nurtured, catering to the interests of &quot;otaku&quot;. Secondly, the vertical structure of Japanese society identifies the value of individuals by their success. Until the late 1980s, unathletic and unattractive males focused on academics, hoping to secure a good job and marry to raise their social standing. Those unable to succeed socially focused instead on their interests, often into adulthood, with their lifestyle centering on those interests, furthering the creation of the otaku subculture.

Even prior to the coinage of the term, the stereotypical traits of the subculture were identified in a 1981 issue of &quot;Fan Rōdo&quot; (Fan road) about &quot;culture clubs&quot;. These individuals were drawn to anime, a counter-culture, with the release of hard science fiction works such as &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;. These works allowed a congregation and development of obsessive interests that turned anime into a medium for unpopular students, catering to obsessed fans. After these fans discovered Comic Market, the term was used as a self-confirming and self-mocking collective identity.

The 1989 &quot;Otaku Murderer&quot; case gave the fandom a negative connotation from which it has not fully recovered. The perception of &quot;otaku&quot; was again damaged in late 2004 when Kaoru Kobayashi kidnapped, sexually assaulted, and murdered a seven-year-old first-grade student. Japanese journalist Akihiro Ōtani suspected that Kobayashi&#x27;s crime was committed by a member of the &quot;figure moe zoku&quot; even before his arrest. Although Kobayashi was not an &quot;otaku&quot;, the degree of social hostility against &quot;otaku&quot; increased. &quot;Otaku&quot; were seen by law enforcement as possible suspects for sex crimes, and local governments called for stricter laws controlling the depiction of eroticism in &quot;otaku&quot; materials.

Not all attention has been negative. In his book &quot;Otaku&quot;, Hiroki Azuma observed: &quot;Between 2001 and 2007, the &quot;otaku&quot; forms and markets quite rapidly won social recognition in Japan&quot;, citing the fact that &quot;[i]n 2003, Hayao Miyazaki won the Academy Award for his &quot;Spirited Away&quot;; around the same time Takashi Murakami achieved recognition for otaku-like designs; in 2004, the Japanese pavilion in the 2004 International Architecture exhibition of the Venice Biennale (Biennale Architecture) featured &#x27;otaku&#x27;. In 2005, the word — one of the keywords of the present volume — was chosen as one of the top ten &#x27;buzzwords of the year&#x27;.&quot; In 2013, a Japanese study of 137,734 people found that 42.2% self-identify as a type of otaku. This study suggests that the stigma of the word has vanished, and the term has been embraced by many. Marie Kondo told ForbesWomen in 2020: &quot;I credit being an otaku with helping me to focus deeply, which definitely contributed to my success.&quot;

In the early 1990s, the otaku subculture started to gain traction in the Western world. According to Lawrence Eng, the first anime that could have caused this to happen was &quot;Gunbuster&quot;, and the protagonist, Noriko Takaya, is teased about her otaku behavior. Through &quot;Gunbuster&quot;, Western audiences would learn about the word &quot;otaku&quot;. In the late 1990s, otaku was a popular subculture among Generation Xers in the United States. In the early 2000s, the otaku community in the United States often consisted of suburban young people and niche online groups.

===Places===
The district of Akihabara in Tokyo, where there are maid cafés featuring waitresses who dress up and act like maids or anime characters, is a notable attraction center for otaku. Akihabara also has dozens of stores specializing in anime, manga, retro video games, figurines, card games, and other collectibles. Another popular location is Otome Road in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. Students from Nagoya City University started a project to help promote hidden tourist attractions and attract more otaku to Nagoya.

===Subtypes===
There are specific terms for different types of otaku, including , a self-mockingly pejorative Japanese term for female fans of , which focuses on homosexual male relationships. are female otaku who are interested in Japanese history. Some terms refer to a location, such as (&quot;Akihabara-style&quot;), which applies to those familiar with Akihabara&#x27;s culture.

Miyadai describes two big subtypes of the otaku type, a world type and a battle royale type. There is a chronological development from the world type of the late 1990s to the battle royale type of the 2000s but they also coexisted. The antagonism between the world type and the battle royale type emerged in the age in which reality and fiction are regarded as equivalent tools for self-defense. He further describes the internet society as a rhizomic structure which invalidates the distinction between &quot;reality&quot; and &quot;fiction&quot;. The world type treats fiction as an equivalent of reality (real-ization of fiction), while the battle royale type treats reality as an equivalent of fiction (fictionalization of reality).

===Media===
Otaku often participate in self-mocking through the production or interest in humor directed at their subculture. Anime and manga otaku are the subject of numerous self-critical works, such as &quot;Otaku no Video&quot;, which contains a live-interview mockumentary that pokes fun at the otaku subculture and includes Gainax&#x27;s own staff as the interviewees. Other works depict otaku subculture less critically, such as &quot;Genshiken&quot; and &quot;Comic Party&quot;. A well-known light novel, which later received a manga and anime adaptation, is &quot;Welcome to the N.H.K.&quot;, which focuses on otaku subcultures and highlights other social outcasts, such as and NEETs. Works that focus on otaku characters include &quot;WataMote&quot;, the story of an unattractive and unsociable otome gamer otaku who exhibits delusions about her social status; and &quot;No More Heroes&quot;, a video game about an otaku assassin named Travis Touchdown and his surrealistic adventures inspired by anime and manga. Media about otaku also exist outside of Japan, such as the American documentary &quot;Otaku Unite!&quot; which focuses on the American side of the otaku culture, and the Filipino novel &quot;Otaku Girl&quot;, which tells the story of a virtual reality world where otaku can role-play and use the powers of their favorite anime characters.

=== Habits ===
A term used in the otaku fandom is , a type of cheering performed as a group. Another term is , which describes vehicles decorated with fictional characters, especially bishōjo game or eroge characters.

==Classification==

The Nomura Research Institute (NRI) has made two major studies into otaku, the first in 2004 and a revised study with a more specific definition in 2005. The 2005 study defines twelve major fields of otaku interests. Of these groups:

* manga otaku were the largest group, with 350,000 individuals and an ¥83 billion market scale.
* Idol otaku were the next largest group, with 280,000 individuals and ¥61 billion.
* Travel otaku were third, with 250,000 individuals and ¥81 billion.
* PC otaku were fourth, with 190,000 individuals and ¥36 billion.
* Video game otaku were fifth, with 160,000 individuals and ¥21 billion.
* Automobile otaku were sixth, with 140,000 individuals and ¥54 billion.
* Anime otaku were seventh, with 110,000 individuals and ¥20 billion.

The remaining five categories include mobile device otaku, with 70,000 individuals and ¥8 billion; audio-visual equipment otaku, with 60,000 individuals and ¥12 billion; camera otaku, with 50,000 individuals and ¥18 billion; fashion otaku, with 40,000 individuals and ¥13 billion; and railway otaku, with 20,000 individuals and ¥4 billion. These values were partially released with a much higher estimation in 2004, but this definition focused on consumerism and not the &quot;unique psychological characteristics&quot; of otaku used in the 2005 study.

The NRI&#x27;s 2005 study also put forth five archetypes of otaku:

* The first is the family-oriented otaku, who has broad interests and is more mature than other otaku; their object of interest is secretive and they are &quot;closet otaku&quot;.
* The second is the serious &quot;leaving my own mark on the world&quot; otaku, with interests in mechanical or business personality fields.
* The third type is the &quot;media-sensitive multiple interest&quot; otaku, whose diverse interests are shared with others.
* The fourth type is the &quot;outgoing and assertive otaku&quot;, who gain recognition by promoting their hobby.
* The last is the &quot;fan magazine-obsessed otaku&quot;, which is predominately female with a small group of males being the &quot;&quot;moe&quot; type&quot;; their secret hobby is focused on the production or interest in fan works.

The Hamagin Research Institute found that -related content was worth ¥88.8 billion ($807 million) in 2005, and one analyst estimated the market could be as much as ¥2 trillion ($18 billion). Japan-based &quot;Tokyo Otaku Mode&quot;, a place for news related to otaku, has been liked on Facebook almost 10 million times.

Other classifications of otaku interests include Vocaloid, cosplay, figures, and professional wrestling, as categorized by the Yano Research Institute, which reports and tracks market growth and trends in sectors heavily influenced by otaku consumerism. In 2012, it noted around 30% of growth in dating sim and online gaming otaku, while Vocaloid, cosplay, idols and maid services grew by 10%, confirming its 2011 predictions.

=== Ōkina otomodachi ===
 is a Japanese phrase that literally translates to &quot;big friend&quot; or &quot;adult friend&quot;. Japanese otaku use it to describe themselves as adult fans of an anime, a manga, or a TV show that is originally aimed at children. A parent who watches such a show with their children is not considered an &quot;ōkina otomodachi&quot;, nor is a parent who buys anime DVDs or manga volumes for their children; &quot;ōkina otomodachi&quot; are those who consume such content by themselves.

<text>An object-modeling language is a standardized set of symbols used to model a software system using an object-oriented framework. The symbols can be either informal or formal ranging from predefined graphical templates to formal object models defined by grammars and specifications.

A modeling language is usually associated with a methodology for object-oriented development. The modeling language defines the elements of the model. E.g., that a model has classes, methods, object properties, etc. The methodology defines the steps developers and users need to take to develop and maintain a software system. Steps such as &quot;Define requirements&quot;, &quot;Develop code&quot;, and &quot;Test system&quot;. 

It is common to equate the modeling language and the modeling methodology. For example, the Booch method may refer to Grady Booch&#x27;s standard for diagramming, his methodology, or both. Or the Rumbaugh Object Modeling Technique is both a set of diagrams and a process model for developing object-oriented systems.

In the early years of the object-oriented community there were several competing modeling and methodology standards. Booch and Rumbaugh were two of the most popular. Ivar Jacobson&#x27;s Objectory, Shlaer-Mellor, and Yourdon-Coad were also popular.

However, the object-oriented community values re-use and standardization. As shown in the graphic there were efforts starting in the mid 1990s to reconcile the leading models and focus on one unified specification. The graphic shows the evolution of one of the most important object modeling language standards: the Unified Modeling Language (UML).

The UML began as an attempt by some of the major thought leaders in the community to define a standard language at the OOPSLA &#x27;95 Conference. Originally, Grady Booch and James Rumbaugh merged their models into a unified model. This was followed by Booch&#x27;s company Rational Software purchasing Ivar Jacobson&#x27;s Objectory company and merging their model into the UML. At the time Rational and Objectory were two of the dominant players in the small world of independent vendors of Object-Oriented tools and methods.

The Object Management Group then picked up and took over ownership of the UML. The OMG is one of the most influential standards organizations in the object-oriented world. The UML is both a formal metamodel and a collection of graphical templates. The meta-model defines the elements in an object-oriented model such as classes and properties. It is essentially the same thing as the meta-model in object-oriented languages such as Smalltalk or CLOS. However, in those cases the meta-model is meant primarily to be used by developers at run time to dynamically inspect and modify an application object model. The UML meta-model provides a mathematical formal foundation for the various graphic views used by the modeling language to describe an emerging system.

The following diagram illustrates the class hierarchy of the various graphic templates defined by the UML. &quot;Structure diagrams&quot; define the static structure of an object: its place in the class hierarchy, its relation to other objects, etc. &quot;Behavior diagrams&quot; specify the dynamic aspects of the model, business process logic, coordination and timing of distributed objects, etc.

<text>&quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot; is a 1947 essay by J. R. R. Tolkien which discusses the fairy story as a literary form. It was written as a lecture entitled &quot;Fairy Stories&quot; for the Andrew Lang lecture at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, on 8 March 1939.

The essay is significant because it contains Tolkien&#x27;s explanation of his philosophy on fantasy, and his thoughts on mythopoeia and sub-creation or worldbuilding. Alongside his 1936 essay &quot;&quot;, it is his most influential scholarly work.

Several scholars have used &quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot; as a route to understanding Tolkien&#x27;s own fantasy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, complete with its sub-created world of Middle-earth. Clyde Northrup contends that in the essay, Tolkien argues that &quot;fairy-story&quot; must contain four qualities, namely fantasy, recovery, escape, and consolation. Derek Shank argues that while Tolkien objects to structuralism in the essay, Tolkien also proposes that a secondary world must have a structure with coherently related parts; but since it works by its effect on the reader, humans are inside the structure and cannot analyse it objectively.

== Context ==

J. R. R. Tolkien was a professional philologist and an author of fantasy fiction, starting with the children&#x27;s book &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in 1937. The Andrew Lang Lecture was important as it brought him to clarify his view of fairy stories as a legitimate literary genre, rather than something intended exclusively for children. By the time of the lecture, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; had become extremely popular, and Tolkien had started work on a sequel, which became &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

== History ==

Tolkien created the material as a lecture entitled &quot;Fairy Stories&quot;; he delivered it as the Andrew Lang lecture at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, on 8 March 1939.

&quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot; first appeared in print, with some enhancement, in 1947, in a &quot;festschrift&quot; volume, &quot;Essays Presented to Charles Williams&quot;, compiled by C. S. Lewis. Charles Williams, a friend of Lewis&#x27;s, had been relocated with the Oxford University Press staff from London to Oxford during the London blitz in World War II. This allowed him to participate in gatherings of the Inklings with Lewis and Tolkien. The volume of essays was intended to be presented to Williams upon the return of the Oxford University Press staff to London with the ending of the war. However, Williams died suddenly on 15 May 1945, and the book was published as a memorial volume. &quot;Essays Presented to Charles Williams&quot; received little attention and was out of print by 1955.

&quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot; began to receive much more attention in 1964, when it was published in &quot;Tree and Leaf&quot;. Since then, &quot;Tree and Leaf&quot; has been reprinted several times, and &quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot; has been reprinted in other compilations of Tolkien&#x27;s works, such as &quot;The Tolkien Reader&quot; in 1966, though that edition was impaired by poor proofreading. It appeared again in the 1980 &quot;Poems and Stories&quot;, and in the 1983 &quot;The Monsters and the Critics, and Other Essays&quot;. &quot;On Fairy Stories&quot; was published on its own in an expanded edition in 2008.

== Synopsis ==

The essay &quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot; is an attempt to explain and defend the genre of fairy tales, under the following headings.

=== Fairy-story ===

Tolkien distinguishes fairy tales from &quot;traveller&#x27;s tales&quot; (such as &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;), science fiction (such as H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The Time Machine&quot;), beast fables (such as Aesop&#x27;s Fables and &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot;), and dream stories (such as &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;).
Tolkien claims that one touchstone of the authentic fairy tale is that it is presented as wholly credible: &quot;It is at any rate essential to a genuine fairy-story, as distinct from the employment of this form for lesser or debased purposes, that it should be presented as &#x27;true&#x27;. ... But since the fairy-story deals with &#x27;marvels&#x27;, it cannot tolerate any frame or machinery suggesting that the whole framework in which they occur is a figment or illusion.&quot;

=== Origins ===

Tolkien comments that fairy stories are ancient, and that it was once thought that they had derived from powerful, elemental &quot;nature-myths&quot;, with gods personifying the sun, night, and other elements of nature. These myths were humanised to legends by telling them with human heroes as protagonists. Finally, the legends dwindled to folktales and fairy stories. But in Tolkien&#x27;s view, this is &quot;almost upside down&quot;. A tale of the Norse god Thor in the Elder Edda, the &quot;Thrymskvitha&quot;, is &quot;certainly just a fairy-story&quot;; it is just as old as the Norse myths. The historical King Arthur, perhaps a minor figure, went into the &quot;Cauldron of Story&quot;, and &quot;was boiled for a long time&quot;, eventually becoming a &quot;King of Faërie&quot;. Tolkien notes that these old stories produce an effect of &quot;distance and a great abyss of time&quot;, and suggests that they were selected precisely because they created this literary effect.

=== Children ===

Tolkien argues that there is no essential connection between fairy stories and children, but that this &quot;is an accident of our domestic history&quot;, meaning that they have been relegated &quot;to the nursery&quot; because adults no longer wanted them. Only some children, he writes, &quot;have any special taste for them&quot;, and he suggests that the taste &quot;increases with age, if it is innate&quot;. He criticises Andrew Lang&#x27;s suggestion that children have an &quot;unblunted edge of belief&quot; as trading on their credulity and inexperience. As an infant, when the &quot;Green Fairy Book&quot; was published, Tolkien says he had &quot;no special &#x27;wish to believe&#x27;. I wanted to know.&quot; On the other hand, fairy stories did awaken desire, such as for dragons. He had no time for Lang&#x27;s talking down to children, or for &quot;covertly sniggering&quot;. He notes that G. K. Chesterton remarked that children are not uncritically tender: &quot;For children are innocent and love justice; while most of us are wicked and naturally prefer mercy.&quot;

=== Fantasy ===

Tolkien emphasises that through the use of fantasy, which he equates with imagination, the author can bring the reader to experience a world that is consistent and rational, under rules other than those of the normal world. He calls this &quot;a rare achievement of Art&quot;, and notes that it was important to him as a reader: &quot;It was in fairy-stories that I first divined the potency of the words, and the wonder of things, such as stone, and wood, and iron; tree and grass; house and fire; bread and wine.&quot;

=== Recovery, Escape, Consolation ===

Tolkien suggests that fairy stories allow the reader to review his own world from the &quot;perspective&quot; of a different world. Tolkien calls this &quot;recovery&quot;, in the sense that one&#x27;s unquestioned assumptions might be recovered and changed by an outside perspective. Second, he defends fairy stories as offering escapist pleasure to the reader, justifying this analogy: a prisoner is not obliged to think of nothing but cells and wardens. And third, Tolkien suggests that fairy stories can provide moral or emotional consolation, through their happy ending, which he terms a &quot;eucatastrophe&quot;.

=== Epilogue ===

In conclusion, Tolkien asserts that a truly good fairy story is marked by joy: &quot;Far more powerful and poignant is the effect [of joy] in a serious tale of Faërie. In such stories, when the sudden &#x27;turn&#x27; comes we get a piercing glimpse of joy, and heart&#x27;s desire, that for a moment passes outside the frame, rends indeed the very web of story, and lets a gleam come through.&quot; Tolkien sees Christianity as partaking in and fulfilling the overarching mythological nature of the cosmos:

The Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger states that &quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot; would be at the centre of Tolkien research simply because it is Tolkien&#x27;s own explanation of his art, of the &quot;sub-creation&quot; (in his terminology) of a secondary world. She at once adds that it is much more than that, since it is &quot;a deeply perceptive commentary on the interdependence of language and human consciousness&quot;, a useful summary of the study of folklore at that time, and a &quot;cogent&quot; analysis of myth, fairy-story, and &quot;the poet&#x27;s craft&quot;. It is also, Flieger writes, an essential text for study of &quot;the multivalent myth, epic and fairy tale romance that is &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.&quot; In her view, alongside his 1936 essay &quot;&quot;, the essay is his most influential scholarly work. 

The folklorist Juliette Wood, writing in &quot;A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien&quot;, comments that the image of Galadriel&#x27;s creating her magic mirror by pouring water illustrated how central the &quot;imaginative reworking of reality&quot; was to the theory of fantasy that Tolkien set out in the essay. Carl Phelpstead, also writing in the &quot;Companion&quot;, notes that the essay attempts to answer three questions, namely what fairy-tales are, their origins, and their value, the last of these related to Tolkien&#x27;s concept of mythopoeia.

Clyde Northrup argues that through the essay Tolkien creates a framework of four necessary qualities for interpreting &quot;Tolkienian fantasy&quot;, or as he called it &quot;fairy-story&quot;. These are fantasy (the contrast of enchantment and ordinariness), recovery (as the reader sees the &quot;magic&quot; of simple things in daily life), escape (from the primary world), and consolation (the &quot;happy ending&quot;). He suggests that these can be applied both to Tolkien&#x27;s own Middle-earth fantasies, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and to the works of later fantasy authors including David Eddings, Roger Zelazny, Stephen R. Donaldson, and J. K. Rowling.

Derek Shank, in &quot;Tolkien Studies&quot;, argues that while &quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot; criticises the application of structuralism to folklore, since &quot;being bound up in the transcendental, it cannot account for the transcendent&quot;, Tolkien actually uses a similar analysis to relate &quot;human beings, language, stories, and the external world.&quot; Shank notes that in the essay, Tolkien states that fantastic language alone, in his words &quot;the green sun&quot;, is not enough to create fantasy. Instead, the green sun will only become believable, Shank writes, when the author, the sub-creator or worldbuilder, &quot;construct[s] the Secondary World to form a coherent and organic whole in which all the parts are harmoniously interrelated—in other words, a structure.&quot;

Shank concludes, however, that Tolkien moves away from structuralism in the essay&#x27;s epilogue, by likening fairy stories to the Gospel, which (he writes) has a profound effect on the people who hear it, whether they accept or reject it. Thus, Shank writes, Tolkien goes from structure to a story&#x27;s effects, &quot;the realm of phenomenology and psychoanalysis.&quot; These too may have structure, but since humans are now inside that structure, people cannot analyse it, or fairy stories, objectively.

<doc id="22727" wikidata="Q2553028" url="?curid=22727" title="Otaku no Video">
<text>is a 1991 Japanese original video animation (OVA) produced by Gainax. The anime spoofs the life and culture of otaku, individuals with obsessive interests in media, particularly anime and manga, as well as the history of Gainax and its creators. It is noted for its mix of conventional documentary film styles with a more traditional anime storytelling fashion. It is licensed in the United States by AnimEigo. The &quot;DAICON III and IV Opening Animations&quot; from the early 1980s are also featured in this OVA.

==Plot==
The story begins in &quot;Otaku no Video 1982&quot;, where the main character is an everyman character, Ken Kubo, living with his girlfriend Yoshiko and as a member of his college&#x27;s tennis team, until introduced by his former friend Tanaka to a club of enthusiasts: a female illustrator, an information geek, a martial artist, and a weapons collector. Kubo soon joins them; and when Yoshiko, who hates otaku, abandons him, makes the wish to become the supreme enthusiast, under the name of &quot;Otaking&quot;.

Kubo&#x27;s quest continues in &quot;More Otaku no Video 1985&quot;, set three years later, in which he creates his model kits, opens shops, and builds a factory in China. Later, he loses his fortune when one of his rivals (now married to Yoshiko) takes control of his enterprise; but Kubo and Tanaka, with hard-working artist Misuzu, gradually take over the anime industry with a &#x27;magical girl&#x27; show, &quot;Misty May&quot;. At the peak of their ambitions, Ken and Tanaka create Otakuland in 1999: the equivalent of Disneyland for otaku (the story suggests Otakuland to be located in the same city of Urayasu, Chiba Prefecture, as the original Tokyo Disneyland.)

Many years later, Ken and Tanaka return to Otakuland in a post-apocalyptic submerged Japan and find its central structure, a giant robot, converted into a functional spaceship piloted by their old friends. Miraculously rejuvenated, they fly into space in search of &quot;The Planet of Otaku&quot;.

Part of &quot;Otaku no Video&quot; was the inclusion of live-action documentary excerpts, titled &quot;A Portrait of an Otaku&quot;. In these segments, the documentary crew would interview an anonymous otaku, typically ashamed at being a fan and whose face are censored with a mosaic and have their voices digitally masked. The mock documentary segments serve as a counterpoint to the anime: while the anime emphasizes the camaraderie, creativity, and dreams of mainstream acceptance of otaku, the mock interviews exaggerate its negative qualities. The subjects run the gamut of the otaku subculture: the interviews cover a cosplayer who now works as a computer programmer and outright denies his cosplay days, even when presented with photographic evidence, but keeps his Char Aznable helmet in his desk drawer, an airsoft otaku, a garage kit otaku, and a shut-in who video-records television programs for trade, but has not actually watched anything he is recorded. The interviews also contain fans who engage in a range of illicit or unsavory activities, such as cel thieves, a pornography fan attempting to manufacture glasses to defeat the mosaic censorship common in Japanese porn videos and who is shown masturbating during the interview, and a computer gamer obsessed with a character in a hentai computer game (Kimiko from &quot;Gunbuster&quot; who makes a cameo in Gainax&#x27;s own hentai game, &quot;Cybernetic High School&quot;).

== Production ==
&quot;Otaku no Video&quot; is based on the experiences of Gainax employees which started as a sci-fi and anime fanclub. Staff involved in the OVA include Shinji Higuchi, Takeshi Mori, Kohei Tanaka, Yu Honda, Hidenori Matsubara, and Toshio Okada.

Since &quot;Otaku no Video&quot; was partially based in the personal life of the original creators of Gainax, who started their careers as otaku during the late seventies and the beginning of the eighties, many anime titles from that period are shown as footage or referenced in the OVA (in costumes, cosplay or other related material). Among them are &quot;Gatchaman&quot;, &quot;Uchuu Senkan Yamato&quot;, &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;, &quot;Captain Harlock&quot;, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, &quot;Dirty Pair&quot;, &quot;Space Adventure Cobra&quot;, &quot;Lupin the Third&quot;, &quot;Phoenix 2772&quot;, &quot;Silent Möbius&quot;, &quot;Magical Princess Minky Momo&quot;, &quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Genesis Climber Mospeada&quot;, &quot;Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise&quot;, &quot;Gunbuster&quot;, and the &quot;Daicon III and IV Opening Animations&quot;.

It is believed that all the subjects in the Portrait of an Otaku segments were Gainax employees or connected to Gainax at the time of filming. The first otaku interviewed bore a remarkable resemblance to Toshio Okada, a principal founder in Gainax, in both background and physical appearance. The gaijin otaku, Shon Hernandez, has been confirmed to have been Craig York, who with Shon Howell and Lea Hernandez, whose names were borrowed for the character, were the main staff of General Products USA, an early western branch of Gainax&#x27;s merchandising enterprise in the early 1990s. The interview with &quot;Shon Hernandez&quot; has been a point of contention with Lea Hernandez, who, in an interview with &quot;PULP&quot; magazine, noted that the interview was unscripted and that Craig York had been fairly sincere in his thoughts and had felt that Gainax insulted their American members. In the interview, the words spoken by Shon Hernandez in the background are noticeably different from what is shown on screen via subtitle (which is based on the Japanese voice-over &quot;translation&quot;).

At FanimeCon 2003, Hiroshi Sato, an animator and another Gainax member, mentioned that he had been in one of the interviews in &quot;Otaku no Video&quot;. In &quot;Otaku no Video&quot;, the garage kit otaku was given the pseudonym &quot;Sato Hiroshi&quot; for the interview.

==Release==
The OVA consists of two episodes: &quot;1982 Otaku no video&quot; and &quot;1985 More Otaku no Video&quot;. The first episode of &quot;Otaku no Video&quot; had its world premiere at AnimeCon ‘91 on September 1, 1991, where it was shown on 16mm with an audience of 9 people. The OVA was a commercial failure, which has in part been attributed to the bubble economy at the time as well as the content of the anime.

In Japan the OVA was released on Blu-ray Disc in 2014 by TC Entertainment with a new audio commentary track by staff, as well as the creation of a new master.

It was later released with English subtitles on VHS in North America on March 17, 1993, on DVD on April 2, 2002, and on Blu-ray Disc on June 24, 2016, and a future release on October 8, 2024, all by AnimEigo.

== Reception ==
The OVA was largely praised by critics. Carl Gustav Horn of &quot;J-pop.com&quot; praised the anime saying &quot;&quot;ONV&quot;&#x27;s been known to offend fans in America as much as those in Japan. And you know that may be a mark of quality.&quot; David Smith at &quot;IGN&quot; recommended it for fans of the anime &quot;Genshiken&quot; and said &quot;If you look closely, you can also see some of the secret history of Gainax in there, but you may be laughing too hard to pick up on those subtle details.&quot;

<doc id="22735" wikidata="Q184186" url="?curid=22735" title="Original sin">
<text>Original sin () in Christian theology refers to the condition of sinfulness that all humans share, which is inherited from Adam and Eve due to the Fall, involving the loss of original righteousness and the distortion of the Image of God. The biblical basis for the belief is generally found in Genesis 3 (the story of the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden), and in texts such as (&quot;I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me&quot;) and (&quot;Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned&quot;).

The specific doctrine of original sin was developed in the 3rd century struggle against Gnosticism by Irenaeus of Lyons, and was shaped significantly by Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD), who was the first author to use the phrase &quot;original sin&quot;. Influenced by Augustine, the Councils of Carthage (411–418 AD) and Orange (529 AD) brought theological speculation about original sin into the official lexicon of the Church.

Protestant Reformers such as Martin Luther and John Calvin equated original sin with concupiscence (or &#x27;hurtful desire&#x27;), affirming that it persisted even after baptism and completely destroyed freedom to do good, proposing that original sin involved a loss of free will except to sin. The Jansenist movement, which the Catholic Church declared heretical, also maintained that original sin destroyed freedom of will. Instead, the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; declares that &quot;Baptism, by imparting the life of Christ&#x27;s grace, erases original sin and turns a man back towards God, but the consequences for nature, weakened and inclined to evil, persist in man and summon him to spiritual battle&quot;, and the Council of Trent states that &quot;whereas all men had lost their innocence in the prevarication of Adam [...] although free will, attenuated as it was in its powers, and bent down, was by no means extinguished in them.&quot;

==History==
===Scriptural background and early development===
For the Apostle Paul, Adam&#x27;s act released a power into the world by which sin and death became the natural lot of mankind, a view which is evident in 2 Esdras, 2 Baruch and the &quot;Apocalypse of Moses&quot;. Paul uses much of the same language observed in 4 Ezra and 2 Baruch, such as Adam-death associations. He also emphasizes the individual human responsibility for their sins when he described the predominance of death over all &quot;because all have sinned&quot; (). Early Christianity had no specific doctrine of original sin prior to the 4th century. The idea developed incrementally in the writings of the Early Church Fathers in the centuries after the New Testament was composed. The late 1st- or early 2nd-century &quot;Didache&quot;&#x27;s seemingly exclusive preference for adult baptism offers evidence that its author may have believed that children were born sinless. The authors of the Shepherd of Hermas and the Epistle of Barnabas, also from the late 1st or early 2nd centuries, assumed that children were born without sin. However Clement of Rome and Ignatius of Antioch, from the same period, took universal sin for granted but did not explain its origin from anywhere; and while Clement of Alexandria in the late 2nd century did propose that sin was inherited from Adam, he did not say how.

The biblical bases for original sin are generally found in the following passages, the first and last of which explain why the sin is described as &quot;original&quot;:
* , the story of the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden;
* , &quot;I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me&quot;;
* , &quot;Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned...&quot;
Genesis 3, the story of the Garden of Eden, makes no association between sex and the disobedience of Adam and Eve, nor is the serpent associated with Satan, nor are the words &quot;sin,&quot; &quot;transgression,&quot; &quot;rebellion,&quot; or &quot;guilt&quot; mentioned. The words of Psalm 51:5 read: &quot;Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin my mother conceived me&quot;, but while the speaker traces their sinfulness to the moment of their conception, there is little to support the idea that it was meant to be applicable to all humanity. In the 4th century, Augustine would use texts such as to justify his theory of original sin as originating in &quot;propagation&quot; since Adam rather than being merely &quot;imitation&quot; of Adam as Pelagius claimed (&quot;And the free gift is not like the effect of the one man’s sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brings justification. If, because of the one man’s trespass, death exercised dominion through that one, much more surely will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness exercise dominion in life through the one man, Jesus Christ. Therefore just as one man’s trespass led to condemnation for all, so one man’s act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all.&quot;). However, Pelagians and modern interpreters such as M. Eugene Boring argue that Paul&#x27;s meaning is not that God punishes later generations for the deeds of Adam, but that Adam&#x27;s story is representative for all humanity.

=== Second Temple Judaism ===
The first writings to discuss the first sin at the hands of Adam and Eve were early Jewish texts in the Second Temple Period, such as the Book of Sirach and the Wisdom of Solomon. In these writings, there is no notion that sin is inherent to an individual or that it is transmitted upon conception. Instead, Adam is more largely seen as a heroic figure and the first patriarch. Rather, the beginnings of sin were seen in the stories of Cain or the sons of God mentioned in Genesis 6.

Despite the lack of a notion of original sin, by the 1st century, a number of texts did discuss the roles of Adam and Eve as the first to have committed sin. While states that &quot;God created man for incorruption[...] but death entered the world by the envy of the devil&quot; (2:23–24), states that &quot;Sin began with a woman, and we must all die because of her&quot; (25:24). The notion of the hereditary transmission of sin from Adam was rejected by both 4 Ezra and 2 Baruch in favor of individual responsibility for sin. Despite describing death as having come to all men through Adam, these texts also held to the notion that it is still the individual that is ultimately responsible for committing his own sin and that it is the individual&#x27;s sin, rather than the sin of Adam and Eve, that God condemns in a person. Ian McFarland argues that it is the context of this Judaism through which Paul&#x27;s discussions on the fall of Adam are to be better understood.

=== Greek Fathers before Augustine ===
Justin Martyr, a 2nd-century Christian apologist and philosopher, was the first Christian author to discuss the story of Adam&#x27;s fall after Paul. In Justin&#x27;s writings, there is no conception of original sin and the fault of sin lies at the hands of the individual who committed it. In his Dialogue with Trypho, Justin wrote &quot;The Christ has suffered to be crucified for the race of men who, since Adam, were fallen to the power of death and were in the error of the serpent, each man committing evil by his own fault&quot; (chapter 86) and &quot;Men[...] were created like God, free from pain and death, provided they obeyed His precepts and were deemed worthy by Him to be called His sons, and yet, like Adam and Eve, brought death upon themselves&quot; (chapter 124). Irenaeus was an early father appealed to by Augustine on the doctrine of original sin, although he did not believe that Adam&#x27;s sin was as severe as later tradition would hold and he was not wholly clear about its consequences. One recurring theme in Irenaeus is his view that Adam, in his transgression, is essentially a child who merely partook of the tree ahead of his time.

Origen of Alexandria had a notion similar to, but not the same as original sin, since Genesis was largely allegorical for him. On the other hand, he also believed in the pre-existence of the soul, and theorized that individuals are inherently predisposed to committing sin on account of the transgressions committed in their pre-worldly existence. Origen is the first to quote Romans 5:12–21, but rejected the existence of a sinful state inherited from Adam. To Origen, Adam&#x27;s sin sets an example that all humanity partakes in, but is not inherently born into. Responding to and rejecting Origen&#x27;s theories, Methodius of Olympus rejected the pre-existence of the soul and the allegorical interpretation of Genesis, and in the process, was the first to describe the events of Adam&#x27;s life as the &quot;Fall&quot;.

Greek Fathers would come to emphasize the cosmic dimension of the Fall, namely that since Adam, human beings are born into a fallen world, but held fast to belief that man, though fallen, is free. They thus did not teach that human beings are deprived of free will and involved in total depravity, which is one understanding of original sin among the leaders of the Reformation. During this period the doctrines of human depravity and the inherently sinful nature of human flesh were taught by Gnostics, and orthodox Christian writers took great pains to counter them. Thus Christian apologists such as Justin insisted that God&#x27;s future judgment of humanity implied humanity must have the ability to live righteously.

===Latin Fathers before Augustine===
Tertullian, perhaps the first to believe in hereditary transmission of sin, did so on the basis of the theory of traducianism, the theory that each individual&#x27;s soul was derived from the soul of their two parents, and therefore, because everyone is ultimately a descendant of Adam through sexual reproduction, the souls of humanity are partly derived from Adam&#x27;s own soul—the only one directly created by God, and as a sinful soul, the derived souls of humanity, too, are sinful. Cyprian, on the other hand, believed that individuals were born already guilty of sin, and he was the first to link his notion of original guilt with infant baptism. Cyprian writes that the infant is &quot;born has not sinned at all, except that carnally born according to Adam, he has contracted the contagion of the first death from the first nativity.&quot; Another text to assert the connection between original sin and infant baptism was the Manichaen &quot;Letter to Menoch&quot;, although it is of disputed authenticity.

Ambrose accepted the idea of hereditary sin, also linking it, like Cyprian, to infant baptism, but as a shift from earlier proponents of a transmitted sin, he argued that Adam&#x27;s sin was solely his own fault, in his attempt to attain equality with God, rather than the fault of the devil. One contemporary of Ambrose was Ambrosiaster, the first to introduce a translation of Romans 5:12 that substituted the language of all being in death &quot;because all sinned&quot; to &quot;in him all sinned&quot;. Augustine&#x27;s primary formulation of original sin was based on this mistranslation of Romans 5:12. This mistranslation would act as the basis for Augustine&#x27;s complete development of the doctrine of original sin, and Augustine would quote Ambrosiaster as the source. Some exegetes still justify the doctrine of original sin based on the wider context of Romans 5:12–21.

Hilary of Poitiers did not clearly articulate a concept of original sin, though anticipates the views of Augustine, as he declared that all humanity is implicated in Adam&#x27;s downfall.

===Augustine of Hippo===
On the precise nature of Adam&#x27;s sin, Augustine taught that it was both an act of foolishness (&quot;insipientia&quot;) and of pride and disobedience to God of Adam and Eve. He thought it was a most subtle work to discern what came first: self-centeredness or failure in seeing truth, as he wrote to the Pelagian bishop Julian of Eclanum. The sin of Adam and Eve would not have taken place if Satan had not sown into their senses &quot;the root of evil&quot; (&quot;radix mali&quot;).

The sin of Adam is transmitted by concupiscence, or &quot;hurtful desire&quot;, resulting in humanity becoming a (mass of perdition, condemned crowd), with much enfeebled, though not destroyed, freedom of will. When Adam sinned, human nature was thenceforth transformed. He believed that prior to the Fall, Adam had both the freedom to sin and not to sin (&quot;posse peccare, posse non peccare&quot;), but humans have no freedom to choose not to sin (&quot;non posse non peccare&quot;) after Adam&#x27;s Fall. Augustine found the original sin inexplicable given the understanding that Adam and Eve were &quot;created with perfect natures&quot; which would fail to explain how the evil desire arose in them in the first place. Augustine also identified male semen as the means by which original sin was made heritable, leaving only Jesus Christ, conceived without semen, free of the sin passed down from Adam through the sexual act. This sentiment was echoed as late as 1930 by Pope Pius XI in his : &quot;The natural generation of life has become the path of death by which original sin is communicated to the children.&quot;

====Concupiscence====
Adam and Eve, via sexual reproduction, recreated human nature. Their descendants now live in sin, in the form of concupiscence, a term Augustine used in a metaphysical, not a psychological sense. Thomas Aquinas explained this by pointing out that the &quot;libido&quot; (&quot;concupiscence&quot;), which makes the original sin pass from parents to children, is not a &quot;libido actualis&quot;, i.e. sexual lust, but a &quot;libido habitualis&quot;, i.e. a wound of the whole of human nature. Augustine insisted that concupiscence was not &quot;a being&quot; but a &quot;bad quality&quot;, the privation of good or a wound. He admitted that sexual concupiscence (&quot;libido&quot;) might have been present in the perfect human nature in paradise, and that only later it became disobedient to human will as a result of the first couple&#x27;s disobedience to God&#x27;s will in the original sin. In Augustine&#x27;s view (termed &quot;realism&quot;), all of humanity was really present in Adam when he sinned, and therefore all have sinned. Original sin, according to Augustine, consists of the guilt of Adam that all humans inherit. Although earlier Christian authors taught the elements of physical death, moral weakness, and a sin propensity within original sin, Augustine was the first to add the concept of inherited guilt (&quot;reatus&quot;) from Adam whereby an infant was eternally damned at birth. Augustine held the traditional view that free will was weakened but not destroyed by original sin until he converted in 412 AD to the Stoic view that humanity had no free will except to sin as a result of his anti-Pelagian view of infant baptism.

====Anti-Pelagianism====
Augustine articulated his explanation in reaction to his understanding of Pelagianism that would insist that humans have of themselves, without the necessary help of God&#x27;s grace, the ability to lead a morally good life, thus denying both the importance of baptism and the teaching that God is the giver of all that is good. According to this understanding, the influence of Adam on other humans was merely that of bad example, thus, original sin consists in &quot;imitation&quot; of Adam. Augustine held that the effects of Adam&#x27;s sin are transmitted to his descendants not by example but by the very fact of generation from that ancestor (&quot;propagation&quot;). A wounded nature comes to the soul and body of the new person from their parents, who experience &quot;libido&quot; (or &quot;concupiscence&quot;). Augustine frequently cited Romans 5 to refute the Pelagian theory of imitation.But observe more attentively what he says, that “through the offence of one, many are dead.” For why should it be on account of the sin of one, and not rather on account of their own sins, if this passage is to be understood of &quot;imitation&quot;, and not of &quot;propagation?&quot; But mark what follows: “And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift; for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the grace is of many offences unto justification.” [Romans 5:16] Now let them tell us, where there is room in these words for &quot;imitation&quot;. “By one,” says he, “to condemnation.” By one what except one sin? [...] That person, therefore, greatly deceives both himself and others, who teaches that they will not be involved in condemnation; whereas the apostle says: “Judgment from one offence to condemnation,” [Romans 5:16] and again a little after: “By the offence of one upon all persons to condemnation.” [Romans 5:18]Augustine&#x27;s view was that human procreation was the way the transmission was being effected. He did not blame, however, the sexual passion itself, but the spiritual concupiscence present in human nature, soul and body, even after baptismal regeneration. This was because, according to Augustine, sexual desire is only one—though the strongest—of many physical realizations of that spiritual libido. Christian parents transmit their wounded nature to children, because they give them birth, not the &quot;re-birth&quot;. Augustine used the Ciceronian Stoic concept of passions to interpret Paul&#x27;s doctrine of universal sin and redemption. In that view, sexual desire itself as well as other bodily passions were consequences of the original sin, in which pure affections were wounded by vice and became disobedient to human reason and will. As long as they carry a threat to the dominion of reason over the soul, they constitute moral evil, but since they do not presuppose consent, one cannot call them sins. Humanity will be liberated from passions, and pure affections will be restored only when all sin has been washed away and ended, that is in the resurrection of the dead.

====Pelagius&#x27; response====

The theologian Pelagius reacted thoroughly negatively to Augustine&#x27;s theory of original sin. Pelagius considered it an insult to God that humans could be born inherently sinful or biased towards sin, and Pelagius believed that the soul was created by God at conception, and therefore could not be imbued with sin as it was solely the product of God&#x27;s creative agency. Adam did not bring about inherent sin, but he introduced death to the world. Furthermore, Pelagius argued, sin was spread through example rather than hereditary transmission. Pelagius advanced a further argument against the idea of the transmission of sin: since adults are baptized and cleansed of their sin, their children are not capable of inheriting a sin that the parents do not have to begin with.
=== Reaction of the Church to Augustine ===
Opposition to Augustine&#x27;s ideas about original sin, which he had developed in reaction to Pelagianism, arose rapidly. After a long and bitter struggle several councils, especially the Second Council of Orange in 529, confirmed the general principles of Augustine&#x27;s teaching within Western Christianity. However, while the Western Church condemned Pelagius, it did not endorse Augustine entirely and, while Augustine&#x27;s authority was accepted, he was interpreted in the light of writers such as John Cassian, who rejected Pelagius but believed that fallen man could still choose to follow God of his own free will, although it is God who guides his progress. Some of the followers of Augustine identified original sin with concupiscence in the psychological sense, but Anselm of Canterbury challenged this identification in the 11th century, defining original sin as &quot;privation of the righteousness that every man ought to possess&quot;, thus separating it from concupiscence. In the 12th century the identification of original sin with concupiscence was supported by Peter Lombard and others, but was rejected by the leading theologians in the next century, most notably by Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas distinguished the supernatural gifts of Adam before the fall from what was merely natural, and said that it was the former that were lost, privileges that enabled man to keep his inferior powers in submission to reason and directed to his supernatural end. Even after the fall, man thus kept his natural abilities of reason, will and passions. Rigorous Augustine-inspired views persisted among the Franciscans, though the most prominent Franciscan theologians, such as Duns Scotus and William of Ockham, eliminated the element of concupiscence and identified original sin with the loss of sanctifying grace. Eastern Christian theology has questioned Western Christianity&#x27;s ideas on original sin from the outset and does not promote the idea of inherited guilt.

In &quot;Cur Deus Homo&quot;, Anselm of Canterbury explained that after the original sin of Adam and Eve, the sacrifice of Christ&#x27;s passion and death on the cross was necessary for the human race to be restored to the possibility of entering Paradise for eternal life. Indeed, a life of infinite duration required infinite merits of salvation that only the infinitely valuable blood shed by the Lord could purchase. Thomas Aquinas maintains &quot;that Christ is the head of the Church, and that the grace that he possesses as head is passed on to all the members of the Church because of the organic conjunction that obtains within the Mystical Body.&quot; Quoting , Aquinas declares that the passion of Christ satisfied superabundantly for the sins of the whole world. The death of Christ was necessary only as a result of God&#x27;s free decision to redeem humankind in a suitable manner, showing forth both the justice and the mercy of God.

===Protestant Reformation===
Both Martin Luther (1483–1546) and John Calvin (1509–1564) represent a radical Augustinian shift: equating concupiscence with original sin, maintaining that it destroyed free will and persisted after baptism. Luther asserted that humans inherit Adamic guilt and are in a state of sin from the moment of conception. The second article in the orthodox statement of Lutheran doctrine, the Augsburg Confession presents its doctrine of original sin in summary form.
Calvin developed a systematic theology of Augustinian Protestantism with reference to Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s notion of original sin. Calvin believed that humans inherit Adamic guilt and are in a state of sin from the moment of conception. This inherently sinful nature (the basis for the Reformed doctrine of &quot;total depravity&quot;) results in a complete alienation from God and the total inability of humans to achieve reconciliation with God based on their own abilities. Not only do individuals inherit a sinful nature due to Adam&#x27;s fall, but since he was the federal head and representative of the human race, all whom he represented inherit the guilt of his sin by imputation. Redemption by Jesus Christ is the only remedy. Calvin defined original sin in his &quot;Institutes of the Christian Religion&quot; as follows.
=== Council of Trent ===

The defining doctrinal statement of the Counter-Reformation, the Council of Trent (1545–1563), while not pronouncing on points disputed among Catholic theologians, opposes Protestantism in stating that &quot;whereas all men had lost their innocence in the prevarication of Adam [...] although free will, attenuated as it was in its powers, and bent down, was by no means extinguished in them.&quot; The Council also condemned the teaching that in baptism the whole of what belongs to the essence of sin is not taken away, but is only cancelled or not imputed, and declared the concupiscence that remains after baptism not truly and properly &quot;sin&quot; in the baptized, but only to be called sin in the sense that it is of sin and inclines to sin.

In 1567, soon after the close of the Council of Trent, Pope Pius V went beyond Trent by sanctioning Aquinas&#x27; distinction between nature and supernature in Adam&#x27;s state before the Fall, condemned the equating of original sin with concupiscence, and approved the view that the unbaptized could have right use of will. The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; states, &quot;Whilst original sin is effaced by baptism concupiscence still remains in the person baptized; therefore original sin and concupiscence cannot be one and the same thing, as was held by the early Protestants (see Council of Trent, Sess. V, can. v).&quot;

===Modern theologians===
Søren Kierkegaard, Paul Tillich and Reinhold Niebuhr thought that the doctrine of original sin is not necessarily linked to some act of disobedience by the first human beings; rather, the Fall describes every human person&#x27;s existential situation. Karl Barth rejected the concepts of original guilt and original corruption for being, as he thought, deterministic and undermining human responsibility; instead, he advanced, as noted by Loke, &quot;an alternative conception of Original Sin (&quot;Ursünde&quot;) which rests upon the idea that God sees, addresses, and treats humanity as a unity on account of the disobedience that is universal.&quot; For Barth, Adam did not pass on sin as corruption. In response to Augustine&#x27;s problem of the inexplicability of original sin, Loke responds that God is not the first cause of evil, rather created libertarian agents who freely choose evil are the first causes of evil.

==Denominational views==
===Catholicism===

In the theology of the Catholic Church, original sin is the absence of original holiness and justice into which humans are born, distinct from the actual sins that a person commits. The absence of sanctifying grace or holiness in the new-born child is an effect of the first sin, for Adam, having received holiness and justice from God, lost it not only for himself but also for humanity. The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; sets forth the Catholic doctrine of original sin in brief.

Anselm of Canterbury wrote that &quot;there is a difference between the sin of Adam on the one hand, and the sins of children on the other: one is the cause and one is the effect.&quot; Following this, Catholic doctrine sees the original sin of a child as distinct from the fault of Adam, but rather as one of its effects. The effects of Adam&#x27;s sin according to the Catholic Encyclopedia are the following.

# Death and suffering: &quot;One man has transmitted to the whole human race not only the death of the body, which is the punishment of sin, but even sin itself, which is the death of the soul.&quot;
# Concupiscence or inclination to sin: baptism erases original sin but the inclination to sin remains.
# The absence of sanctifying grace in the new-born child is also an effect of the first sin, for Adam, having received holiness and justice from God, lost it not only for himself but also for humanity. Baptism confers original sanctifying grace, lost through the Adam&#x27;s sin, thus eliminating original sin and any personal sin.

The Catholic Church teaches that every human person born on earth is made in the image of God. Within man &quot;is both the powerful surge toward the good because we are made in the image of God, and the darker impulses toward evil because of the effects of Original Sin&quot;. Furthermore, it explicitly denies that guilt is inherited from anyone, maintaining that instead humanity inherits its own fallen nature. In this it differs from the Reformed position that each person actually inherits Adam&#x27;s guilt, and teaches instead that &quot;original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam&#x27;s descendants [...] but the consequences for nature, weakened and inclined to evil, persist in man&quot;. This view, that human beings do not bear guilt for the sin of Adam, is also held in Eastern Orthodoxy. The Catholic Church teaches, &quot;By our first parents&#x27; sin, the devil has acquired a certain domination over man, even though man remains free.&quot;

The Catholic Church has always held baptism to be for the remission of sins including the original sin, and, as mentioned in &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, infants too have traditionally been baptized, though not held guilty of any actual personal sin. The sin that through baptism is remitted for them could only be original sin. Baptism confers original sanctifying grace that erases original sin and any actual personal sin. The first comprehensive theological explanation of this practice of baptizing infants, guilty of no actual personal sin, was given by Augustine of Hippo, not all of whose ideas on original sin have been adopted by the Catholic Church—the church has condemned the Protestant interpretation of Augustine characteristic of Luther and Calvin which involves total depravity, or a complete loss of freedom to will rightly.

The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; explains that &quot;by yielding to the tempter, Adam and Eve committed a personal sin, but this sin affected the human nature that they would then transmit in a fallen state. [... Original] sin is called &quot;sin&quot; only in an analogical sense: it is a sin &quot;contracted&quot; and not &quot;committed&quot; - a state and not an act.&quot; This &quot;state of deprivation of the original holiness and justice[...] transmitted to the descendants of Adam along with human nature&quot; involves no personal responsibility or personal guilt on their part (as stated in para. 405 of the &quot;Catechism&quot;). Personal responsibility and guilt were Adam&#x27;s, who because of his sin, was unable to pass on to his descendants a human nature with the holiness with which it would otherwise have been endowed, in this way implicating them in his sin. The doctrine of original sin thus does not impute the sin of the father to his children, but merely states that they inherit from him a &quot;human nature deprived of original holiness and justice&quot;, which is &quot;transmitted by propagation to all mankind&quot;.

In Catholic theology, the meaning of the word &quot;concupiscence&quot; is the movement of the sensitive appetite contrary to the operation of the human reason. The apostle St Paul identifies it with the rebellion of the &quot;flesh&quot; against the &quot;spirit&quot;. &quot;Concupiscence stems from the disobedience of the first sin. It unsettles man&#x27;s moral faculties and, without being in itself an offence, inclines man to commit sins.&quot;

====Salvation of infants====
Augustine believed that unbaptized infants go to hell as a consequence of original sin. The Latin Church Fathers who followed Augustine adopted his position, which became a point of reference for Latin theologians in the Middle Ages. In the later medieval period, some theologians continued to hold Augustine&#x27;s view. Others held that unbaptized infants suffered no pain at all: unaware of being deprived of the beatific vision, they enjoyed a state of natural, not supernatural happiness. Starting around 1300, unbaptized infants were often said to inhabit the &quot;limbo of infants&quot;. The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, declares: &quot;As regards children who have died without Baptism, the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God, as she does in her funeral rites for them. Indeed, the great mercy of God who desires that all men should be saved, and Jesus&#x27; tenderness toward children which caused him to say: &quot;Let the children come to me, do not hinder them,&quot; allow us to hope that there is a way of salvation for children who have died without Baptism. All the more urgent is the Church&#x27;s call not to prevent little children coming to Christ through the gift of holy Baptism.&quot; But the theory of Limbo, while it &quot;never entered into the dogmatic definitions of the Magisterium[...] remains[...] a possible theological hypothesis&quot;.

====Post-conciliar developments====
Soon after the Second Vatican Council, biblical theologian Herbert Haag raised the question; &quot;Is original sin in Scripture?&quot; According to his exegesis, would indicate that Adam and Eve were created from the beginning naked of the divine grace, an originary grace that, then, they would never have had, and much less would have lost due to the subsequent events narrated. On the other hand, while supporting a continuity in the Bible about the absence of preternatural gifts (), with regard to the ophitic event, Haag never makes any reference to the discontinuity of the loss of access to the tree of life. states that, if one ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, one would surely die, and the adverb indicates that, by avoiding this type of choice, one would have the possibility but not the certainty of accessing to the other tree. Therefore, in 1970 Latin American biblical scholar Carlos Mesters wondered if &quot;Eden [is] golden age or goad to action&quot;, or eschatology, nostalgia for an idealized past or hope for something that has yet to happen as it is claimed by and .

Some warn against taking Genesis 3 too literally. They take into account that &quot;God had the church in mind before the foundation of the world&quot; (as in as also in , &quot;...his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus &quot;before&quot; the world began.&quot; In his 1986 book &quot;″In the Beginning...″&quot;, Pope Benedict XVI referred to the term &quot;original sin&quot; as &quot;misleading and unprecise&quot;. Benedict does not require a literal interpretation of Genesis, or of the origin of evil, but writes, &quot;How was it possible, how did it happen? This remains obscure. Evil is not logical. Only God and good are logical, are light. Evil remains mysterious. It is presented as such in great images, as it is in chapter 3 of Genesis, with that scene of the two trees, of the serpent, of sinful man: a great image that makes us guess but cannot explain what is itself illogical.&quot;

===Protestantism===
====Lutheranism====
Article 1 of the Formula of Concord, an authoritative statement of Lutheran doctrine, teaches that original sin &quot;is a root and fountain-head of all actual sins.&quot;

==== Reformed ====
There are two elements of original sin in Reformed theology: &quot;original guilt&quot; and &quot;original pollution&quot;. The term &quot;guilt&quot; refers to a &quot;relation to the penal sanction of the law&quot;, or the obligation to satisfy God&#x27;s justice due to a willful violation of his law. In covenant theology, Adam is regarded as the &quot;federal head&quot; of the human race, and so by his sin and Fall, the guilt of his sin is imputed to all his descendents, as Louis Berkhof states, drawing from , &quot;God adjudges all men to be guilty sinners in Adam, just as He adjudges all believers to be righteous in Jesus Christ. This is what Paul means, when he says: &#x27;So then as through one trespass the judgment came unto all men to condemnation; even so through one act of righteousness the free gift came unto all men to justification of life. For as through the one man&#x27;s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one shall the many be made righteous,&#x27; Rom. 5:18, 19.&quot; The Fall also resulted in an &quot;original pollution&quot;, which involves the absence of original righteousness and the presence of an active disposition towards sin. The pervasive nature of this pollution in the human race is emphasized with the term &quot;total depravity&quot;, that is, the notion that the corruption of original sin extends to every part of man&#x27;s nature, and that there is nothing in man which can vindicate him before God. The effect of total depravity is &quot;total inability&quot;, which means that, although fallen man may perform natural, civil and externally religious goods or virtues, yet he cannot do any act which pleases God and he cannot even begin to love God rather than himself.

The Reformed conception of free will is that fallen man does indeed retain the faculties of the soul such as reason, conscience and freedom of choice, yet, he has by nature an irresistible desire to commit sin, and cannot will the highest good, which was part of his original moral constitution. In his fallen state, man commits many actual sins () which &quot;does not merely denote those external actions which are accomplished by means of the body, but all those conscious thoughts and volitions which spring from original sin.&quot; This reflects the Reformed conflation of concupiscence with sin proper.

==== Anglicanism ====
The original formularies of the Church of England also continue in the Reformation understanding of original sin, which is evident in Article 9 (&quot;Of Original or Birth-sin&quot;) of the Thirty-nine Articles.

However, more recent doctrinal statements permit a greater variety of understandings of this doctrine, such as the 1938 report &quot;Doctrine in the Church of England&quot;.

==== Methodism ====
The Methodist Church upholds Article VII in the Articles of Religion in the &quot;Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church&quot;:

Methodist theology teaches that a believer is made free from original sin when they are entirely sanctified.

==== Quakers ====

Most Quakers (also known as the &quot;Religious Society of Friends&quot;), including the founder of Quakerism, George Fox, believe in the doctrine of inward light, a doctrine that states that there is &quot;that of God in everyone&quot;. This has led to a common belief among many liberal and universalist Quakers affiliated with the Friends General Conference and Britain Yearly Meeting, based on the ideas of Quaker Rufus Jones among others, that rather than being burdened by original sin, human beings are inherently good, and the doctrine of universal reconciliation, that is, that all people will eventually be saved and reconciled with God.

However, this rejection of the doctrine of original sin or the necessity of salvation is not something that most conservative or evangelical Quakers affiliated with Friends United Meeting or Evangelical Friends Church International tend to agree with. Although the more conservative and evangelical Quakers also believe in the doctrine of inward light, they interpret it in a manner consistent with the doctrine of original sin, namely, that people may or may not listen to the voice of God within them and be saved, and people who do not listen will not be saved.

==== Seventh-day Adventism ====

Seventh-day Adventists believe that humans are inherently sinful due to the fall of Adam, but they do not totally accept the Augustinian/Reformed understanding of original sin, taught in terms of original guilt, but hold more to what could be termed the &quot;total depravity&quot; tradition. Seventh-day Adventists have historically preached a doctrine of inherited weakness, but not a doctrine of inherited guilt. According to Augustine and Calvin, humanity inherits not only Adam&#x27;s depraved nature but also the actual guilt of his transgression, while Adventists look more toward the Wesleyan model. In part, the Adventist position on original sin reads thus.

Early Adventist pioneers (such as George Storrs and Uriah Smith) tended to de-emphasise the morally corrupt nature inherited from Adam, while stressing the importance of actual, personal sins committed by the individual. They thought of the &quot;sinful nature&quot; in terms of physical mortality rather than moral depravity. Traditionally, Adventists look at sin in terms of willful transgressions, and believe that Christ triumphed over sin. Though believing in the concept of inherited sin from Adam, there is no dogmatic Adventist position on original sin.

===Eastern Christianity===

The Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic Churches&#x27; version of original sin is the view that sin originates with the Devil, &quot;for the devil sins from the beginning (1 John iii. 8)&quot;. The Eastern Church never subscribed to Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s notions of original sin and hereditary guilt. The church does not interpret &quot;original sin&quot; as having anything to do with transmitted guilt but with transmitted mortality. Because Adam sinned, all humanity shares not in his guilt but in the same punishment.

The Eastern Churches accept the teachings of Church Father John Cassian, as does the Catholic Church, in rejecting the doctrine of total depravity, by teaching that human nature is &quot;fallen&quot;, that is, depraved, but not totally. Augustine Casiday states that Cassian &quot;baldly asserts that God&#x27;s grace, not human free will, is responsible for &#x27;everything [that] pertains to salvation&#x27; – even faith&quot;. Cassian points out that people still have moral freedom and one has the option to choose to follow God. Colm Luibhéid says that according to Cassian, there are cases where the soul makes the first little turn, while Augustine Casiday says that, in Cassian&#x27;s view, any sparks of goodwill that may exist, not directly caused by God, are totally inadequate and only direct divine intervention ensures spiritual progress. Lauren Pristas says that &quot;for Cassian, salvation is, from beginning to end, the effect of God&#x27;s grace&quot;.

Eastern Christianity accepts the doctrine of ancestral sin: &quot;Original sin is hereditary. It did not remain only Adam and Eve&#x27;s. As life passes from them to all of their descendants, so does original sin.&quot; &quot;As from an infected source there naturally flows an infected stream, so from a father infected with sin, and consequently mortal, there naturally proceeds a posterity infected like him with sin, and like him mortal.&quot;

The Orthodox Church in America makes clear the distinction between &quot;fallen nature&quot; and &quot;fallen man&quot; and this is affirmed in the early teaching of the church whose role it is to act as the catalyst that leads to true or inner redemption. Every human person born on this earth bears the image of God undistorted within themselves. In the Eastern Christian understanding, it is explicitly denied that humanity inherited guilt or a fallen nature from anyone; rather, humanity inherits sin&#x27;s consequences and a fallen environment: &quot;while humanity does bear the consequences of the original, or first, sin, humanity does not bear the personal guilt associated with this sin. Adam and Eve are guilty of their willful action; we bear the consequences, chief of which is death.&quot;

=== Restorationist denominations ===
==== Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses ====
According to the theology of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, all humans are born sinners, because of inheriting sin, corruption, and death from Adam. They teach that Adam was originally created perfect and sinless, but with free will; that the Devil, who was originally a perfect angel, but later developed feelings of pride and self-importance, seduced Eve and then, through her, persuaded Adam to disobey God, and to obey the Devil instead, rebelling against God&#x27;s sovereignty, thereby making themselves sinners, and because of that, transmitting a sinful nature to all of their future offspring. Instead of destroying the Devil right away, as well as destroying the disobedient couple, God decided to test the loyalty of the rest of humankind, and to prove that they cannot be independent of God successfully, but are lost without God&#x27;s laws and standards, and can never bring peace to the earth, and that Satan was a deceiver, murderer, and liar.

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that all humans possess &quot;inherited sin&quot; from the &quot;one man&quot; Adam, and teach that verses such as Romans 5:12–22, Psalm 51:5, Job 14:4, and 1 Corinthians 15:22 show that humanity is born corrupt and dies because of inherited sin and imperfection, and that inherited sin is the reason and cause for sickness and suffering, made worse by the Devil&#x27;s wicked influence. They believe Jesus is the &quot;second Adam&quot;, being the sinless Son of God and the Messiah, and that he came to undo Adamic sin; and that salvation and everlasting life can only be obtained through faith and obedience to the second Adam. They believe that &quot;sin&quot; is &quot;missing the mark&quot; of God&#x27;s standard of perfection, and that everyone is born a sinner, due to being the offspring of sinner Adam.

==== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ====
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) rejects the doctrine of original sin. The church&#x27;s second Articles of Faith reads, &quot;We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam&#x27;s transgression.&quot; The church&#x27;s founder Joseph Smith taught that humans had an essentially godlike nature, and were not only holy in a premortal state, but had the potential to progress eternally to become like God. Latter-day Saints take this creed-like statement as a rejection of the doctrine of original sin and any notion of inherited sinfulness. Thus, while modern members of the LDS Church will agree that the fall of Adam brought consequences to the world, including the possibility of sin, they generally reject the idea that any culpability is automatically transmitted to Adam and Eve&#x27;s offspring. Children under the age of eight are regarded as free of all sin and therefore do not require baptism. Doctrine and Covenants 137:10 states that children who die prior to age eight are believed to be saved in the highest degree of heaven. The LDS Church&#x27;s Book of Moses states that the Lord told Adam that &quot;thy children are conceived in sin&quot; (Moses 6). Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated that this means that the children were &quot;born into a world of sin&quot;.

==== Swedenborgianism ====
In Swedenborgianism, exegesis of the first 11 chapters of Genesis from &quot;The First Church&quot; involves the view that Adam is not an individual person. Rather, he is a symbolic representation of the &quot;Most Ancient Church&quot;, having a more direct contact with heaven than all other successive churches. Swedenborg&#x27;s view of original sin is referred to as &quot;hereditary evil&quot;, which passes from generation to generation.

It cannot be completely abolished by an individual man, but can be tempered when someone reforms their own life, and are thus held accountable only for their own sins.
==Immaculate Conception of Mary==
Although primarily associated with Catholicism, the Immaculate Conception (the doctrine that Mary was conceived without original sin) is confessed in some form in several major Christian denominations.

===Catholicism===
The Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of Mary is that Mary was conceived free from original sin: &quot;the most Blessed Virgin Mary was, from the first moment of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege of almighty God and by virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ, Savior of the human race, preserved immune from all stain of original sin&quot;. The doctrine sees her as an exception to the general rule that human beings are not immune from the reality of original sin. As Mary was conceived without original sin, this statement opens to the fourth Marian dogma of the Assumption of Mary to Heaven in body and soul, according to the unchangeable dogmatic definition publicly proclaimed by Pope Pius XII. The Assumption to Heaven, with no corruption of the body, was made possible by Mary&#x27;s being born without the original sin, while, according to Aquinas, other persons need to wait for the final resurrection of the flesh in order to get the sanctification of the whole human being.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
The view of Eastern Christianity varies on whether Mary is free of all actual sin or concupiscence. Some Patristic sources imply that she was cleansed from sin at the Annunciation, while the liturgical references are unanimous that she is all-holy from the time of her conception.

===Lutheranism===
Martin Luther agreed with the Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, as is evident in the following quote.

<text>Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) was the official name used by the U.S. government for both the first stage (2001–2014) of the War in Afghanistan (2001–2021) and the larger-scale Global War on Terrorism. On 7 October 2001, in response to the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush announced that airstrikes against Al-Qaeda and the Taliban had begun in Afghanistan. Beyond the military actions in Afghanistan, Operation Enduring Freedom was also affiliated with counterterrorism operations in other countries, such as OEF-Philippines and OEF-Trans Sahara.

After 13 years, on 28 December 2014, President Barack Obama announced the end of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. Subsequent operations in Afghanistan by the United States&#x27; military forces, both non-combat and combat, occurred under the name Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel.

==Subordinate operations==
Operation Enduring Freedom referred to the U.S.-led combat mission in Afghanistan. The codename was also used for counter-terrorism operations in other countries targeting Al Qaeda and remnants of the Taliban, such as OEF-Philippines, OEF-Trans Sahara, and possibly in Georgia&#x27;s Pankisi Gorge, primarily through government funding vehicles.

==Etymology==
The U.S. government used the term &quot;Operation Enduring Freedom&quot; to officially describe the War in Afghanistan, from the period between 7 October 2001 and 31 December 2014. Subsequent operations in Afghanistan by the United States&#x27; military forces, both non-combat and combat, occurred under the name Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel.

The operation was originally called &quot;Operation Infinite Justice&quot;, but as similar phrases have been used by adherents of several religions as an exclusive description of God, it is believed to have been changed to avoid offense to Muslims who are the majority religion in Afghanistan. In September 2001, U.S. President George W. Bush&#x27;s remark that &quot;this crusade, this war on terrorism, is going to take a while,&quot; which prompted widespread criticism from the Islamic world, may also have contributed to the renaming of the operation.

The term &quot;OEF&quot; typically refers to the phase of the War in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014. Other operations, such as the Georgia Train and Equip Program, are only loosely or nominally connected, such as through government funding vehicles. All the operations, however, have a focus on counterterrorism activities.

Operation Enduring Freedom, which was a joint U.S., U.K., and Afghan operation, was separate from the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), which was an operation of North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations including the U.S. and the U.K. The two operations ran in parallel, although it had been suggested that they merge.

==Overview==
In response to the September 11 attacks, the early combat operations that took place on 7 October 2001 to include a mix of strikes from land-based B-1 Lancer, B-2 Spirit and B-52 Stratofortress bombers, carrier-based F-14 Tomcat and F/A-18 Hornet fighters, and Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from both U.S. and British ships and submarines signaled the start of Operation Enduring Freedom.

The initial military objectives of OEF, as articulated by President George W. Bush in his 20 September address to a Joint Session of Congress and his 7 October address to the country, included the destruction of terrorist training camps and infrastructure within Afghanistan, the capture of al-Qaeda leaders, and the cessation of terrorist activities in Afghanistan.

In January 2002, over 1,200 soldiers from the United States Special Operations Command Pacific (SOCPAC) deployed to the Philippines to support the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in their push to uproot terrorist forces on the island of Basilan. Of those groups included are Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah. The operation consisted of training the AFP in counter-terrorist operations as well as supporting the local people with humanitarian aid in Operation Smiles.

In October 2002, the Combined Task Force 150 and United States military Special Forces established themselves in Djibouti at Camp Lemonnier. The stated goals of the operation were to provide humanitarian aid and patrol the Horn of Africa to reduce the abilities of terrorist organizations in the region. Similar to OEF-P, the goal of humanitarian aid was emphasized, ostensibly to prevent militant organizations from being able to take hold amongst the population as well as reemerge after being removed.

The military aspect involves coalition forces searching and boarding ships entering the region for illegal cargo as well as providing training and equipment to the armed forces in the region. The humanitarian aspect involves building schools, clinics and water wells to enforce the confidence of the local people.

Since 2001, the cumulative expenditure by the U.S. government on Operation Enduring Freedom has exceeded $150 billion.

==Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan==

===Taliban===
Seizing upon a power vacuum after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan after their invasion, the Taliban governed Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. Their extreme interpretation of Islamic law prompted them to ban music, television, sports, and dancing, and enforce harsh judicial penalties (See Human rights in Afghanistan). Amputation was an accepted form of punishment for stealing, and public executions could often be seen at the Kabul football stadium. Women&#x27;s rights groups around the world were frequently critical as the Taliban banned women from appearing in public or holding many jobs outside the home. They drew further criticism when they destroyed the Buddhas of Bamyan, historical statues nearly 1,500 years old, because the Buddhas were considered idols.

In 1996, Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden moved to Afghanistan. When the Taliban came to power, bin Laden was able to forge an alliance between the Taliban and his al-Qaeda organization. It is understood that al-Qaeda-trained fighters known as the 055 Brigade were integrated with the Taliban army between 1997 and 2001. It has been suggested that the Taliban and bin Laden had very close connections.

===U.S.-led coalition action===
On 20 September 2001, the U.S. stated that Osama bin Laden was behind the 11 September attacks in 2001. The U.S. made a five-point ultimatum to the Taliban:
:* Deliver to the U.S. all of the leaders of al-Qaeda
:* Release all imprisoned foreign nationals
:* Close immediately every terrorist training camp
:* Hand over every terrorist and their supporters to appropriate authorities
:* Give the United States full access to terrorist training camps for inspection

On 21 September 2001, the Taliban rejected this ultimatum, stating there was no evidence in their possession linking bin Laden to the 11 September attacks.

On 22 September 2001 the United Arab Emirates and later Saudi Arabia withdrew their recognition of the Taliban as the legal government of Afghanistan, leaving neighboring Pakistan as the only remaining country with diplomatic ties.

On 4 October 2001, it was reported that the Taliban covertly offered to turn bin Laden over to Pakistan for trial in an international tribunal that operated according to Islamic shar&#x27;ia law. On 7 October 2001, the Taliban proposed to try bin Laden in Afghanistan in an Islamic court. This proposition was immediately rejected by the US.

On 14 October 2001, the Taliban proposed to hand bin Laden over to a third country for trial, but only if they were given evidence of bin Laden&#x27;s involvement in the events of 11 September 2001.

The UN Security Council, on 16 January 2002, unanimously established an arms embargo and the freezing of identifiable assets belonging to bin Laden, al-Qaeda, and the remaining Taliban.

===Combat operations start===
On Sunday 7 October 2001, American and British warplanes began fighting Taliban forces and al-Qaeda. Cruise missiles were fired from warships.

The Northern Alliance, aided by Joint Special Operations teams consisting of Green Berets from the 5th Special Forces Group, aircrew members from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), and Air Force Combat Controllers, fought against the Taliban. Aided by U.S. bombing and massive defections, they captured Mazar-i-Sharif on 9 November. They then rapidly gained control of most of northern Afghanistan, and took control of Kabul on 13 November after the Taliban unexpectedly fled the city. The Taliban were restricted to a smaller and smaller region, with Kunduz, the last Taliban-held city in the north, captured on 26 November. Most of the Taliban fled to Pakistan.

The war continued in the south of the country, where the Taliban retreated to Kandahar. Whilst in Kandahar the Taliban agreed to surrender but the deal was rejected by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld as it would have provided amnesty to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar. After Kandahar fell in December, remnants of the Taliban and al-Qaeda continued to mount resistance. Meanwhile, in November 2001 the U.S. military and its allied forces established their first ground base in Afghanistan to the south west of Kandahar, known as FOB Rhino.

The Battle of Tora Bora, involving U.S., German, British and Northern Alliance forces took place in December 2001 to further destroy the Taliban and suspected al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. In early March 2002 the United States military, along with allied Afghan military forces, conducted a large operation to destroy al-Qaeda in an operation code-named Operation Anaconda.

The operation was carried out by elements of the United States 10th Mountain Division, 101st Airborne Division, the U.S. special forces groups TF 11, TF Bowie, TF Dagger, TF K-Bar, British Royal Marines, the Norwegian &quot;Forsvarets Spesialkommando&quot;, &quot;Hærens Jegerkommando&quot; and &quot;Marinejegerkommandoen&quot;, Canada&#x27;s 3rd Battalion Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, Canada&#x27;s Joint Task Force 2, the German KSK, and elements of the Australian Special Air Service Regiment and of the New Zealand Special Air Service and the Afghan National Army.

After managing to evade U.S. forces throughout the summer of 2002, the remnants of the Taliban gradually began to regain their confidence. A U.S. and Canadian led operation (supported by British and Dutch forces), Operation Mountain Thrust was launched in May 2006 to counter renewed Taliban insurgency.

Since January 2006, the NATO International Security Assistance Force undertook combat duties from Operation Enduring Freedom in southern Afghanistan, the NATO force chiefly made up of British, Canadian and Dutch forces (and some smaller contributions from Denmark, Romania and Estonia and air support from Norway as well as air and artillery support from the U.S.) (&quot;see the article Coalition combat operations in Afghanistan in 2006&quot;). The United States military also conducts military operations separate from NATO as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in other parts of Afghanistan, in areas such as Kandahar, Bagram, and Kabul (including Camp Eggers and Camp Phoenix.)

===International support===

The United States was supported by several nations during Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan in 2001–2003 and in subsequent coalition operations directly or indirectly in support of OEF. See the article Afghanistan War order of battle for the disposition of coalition forces in Afghanistan as of 2012.

===Result===
The U.S.-led coalition initially removed the Taliban from power and seriously crippled al-Qaeda and associated militants in Afghanistan. However, success in quelling the Taliban insurgency since the 2001 invasion has faltered. As the war dragged on, the Taliban demonstrated they could not be defeated also thanks to sanctuary in neighboring Pakistan.

On 9 October 2004, Afghanistan elected Hamid Karzai president in its first direct elections. The following year, Afghans conducted the 2005 Afghan parliamentary election on 18 September. Since the invasion, hundreds of schools and mosques have been constructed, millions of dollars in aid have been distributed, and the occurrence of violence has been reduced.

While military forces interdicted insurgents and assured some form of security, Provincial reconstruction teams were tasked with infrastructure building, such as constructing roads and bridges, assisting during floods, and providing food and water to refugees. Many warlords have participated in an allegiance program, formally recognizing the legitimacy of the government of Afghanistan, and formally surrendering their soldiers and weapons. Subsequent actions have led to questions about their true loyalties.

The Afghan National Army, Afghan National Police, and Afghan Border Police were being trained to assume the task of securing their nation.

On 31 December 2014, Operation Enduring Freedom concluded, and was succeeded by Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel on 1 January 2015.

In 2020, the US left Afghanistan to the Taliban under an agreement ensuring a safe passage for American forces out of the country by mid 2021.
On 15 August 2021, all of Afghanistan, besides Kabul, was back in the hands of Taliban. By August 31, all US and allied forces departed the Hamid Karzai International Airport, thus ending any official operations within Afghanistan.

===Criticism===

Hardliner newspapers in Iran and religious scholars in Lebanon suggested &quot;Infinite Imperialism&quot;, &quot;Infinite Arrogance&quot;, or &quot;Infinite Injustice&quot; might have been more appropriate name for the operation.

AFP, reporting on a news story in the Sunday, 3 April 2004, issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, wrote that retired Army Colonel Hy Rothstein, &quot;who served in the Army Special Forces for more than 20 years [and was] commissioned by the Pentagon to examine the war in Afghanistan, concluded the conflict created conditions that have given &#x27;warlordism, banditry and opium production a new lease on life.&#x27; &quot;

The conduct of U.S. forces was criticised in a report entitled &quot;Enduring Freedom – Abuses by U.S. Forces in Afghanistan&quot; by U.S.-based human rights group Human Rights Watch in 2004. Some Pakistani scholars, such as Masood Ashraf Raja, editor of , have also provided a more specific form of criticism that relates to the consequences of the Global War on Terrorism on the region.

==Operation Enduring Freedom – Philippines (OEF-P)==
===Abu Sayyaf Group===

The Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) Al Harakat Al Islamiyya, is deemed a &quot;foreign terrorist organization&quot; by the United States government. Specifically, it is an Islamist separatist group based in and around the southern islands of the Republic of the Philippines, primarily Jolo, Basilan, and Mindanao.

Since inception in the early 1990s, the group has carried out bombings, assassinations, kidnappings, and extortion in their fight for an independent Islamic state in western Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago. Its claimed overarching goal is to create a Pan-Islamic superstate across the &quot;Malay&quot; portions of Southeast Asia, spanning, from east to west, the large island of Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago (Basilan and Jolo islands), the large island of Borneo (Malaysia and Indonesia), the South China Sea, and the Malay Peninsula (Peninsular Malaysia, Thailand and Myanmar).

===Jemaah Islamiyah===

Jemaah Islamiyah is a militant Islamic terrorist organization dedicated to the establishment of a fundamentalist Islamic theocracy in Southeast Asia, in particular Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, the south of Thailand and the Philippines. Jemaah Islamiyah originally used peaceful means to achieve its goals, but later resorted to terrorism because of its connections with al-Qaeda.

Financial links between Jemaah Islamiyah and other terrorist groups, such as Abu Sayyaf and al-Qaeda, have been found to exist. Jemaah Islamiyah means &quot;Islamic Group&quot; or &quot;Islamic Community&quot; and is often abbreviated JI.

Jemaah Islamiyah is thought to have killed hundreds of civilians. Also, it is suspected of carrying out the Bali car bombing on 12 October 2002, in which suicide bombers attacked a nightclub killing 202 people and wounding many more. Most of the casualties were Australian tourists. After this attack, the U.S. State Department designated Jemaah Islamiyah as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Jemaah Islamiyah is also suspected of carrying out the Zamboanga bombings, the Metro Manila bombings, the 2004 Australian embassy bombing and the 2005 Bali terrorist bombing.

===U.S. actions===
In January 2002, 1,200 Members of United States Special Operations Command, Pacific (SOCPAC) were deployed to the Philippines to assist the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in uprooting al-Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiyah and Abu Sayyaf. The members of SOCPAC were assigned to assist in military operations against the terrorist forces as well as humanitarian operations for the island of Basilan, where most of the conflict was expected to take place.

The United States Special Forces (SF) Unit trained and equipped special forces and scout rangers of the AFP, creating the Light Reaction Company (LRC). The LRC and elements of SOCPAC deployed to Basilan on completion of their training. The stated goals of the deployment were denying the ASG sanctuary, surveiling, controlling, and denying ASG routes, surveiling supporting villages and key personnel, conducting local training to overcome AFP weaknesses and sustain AFP strengths, supporting operations by the AFP &quot;strike force&quot; (LRC) in the area of responsibility (AOR), conducting and supporting civil affairs operations in the AOR.

===Result===
The desired result was for the AFP to gain sufficient capability to locate and destroy the ASG, to recover hostages and to enhance the legitimacy of the Philippine government. Much of the operation was a success: the ASG was driven from Basilan and one U.S. hostage was recovered. The Abu Sayyaf Group&#x27;s ranks, which once counted more than 800 members, was reduced to less than 100. The humanitarian portion of the operation, Operation Smiles, created 14 schools, 7 clinics, 3 hospitals and provided medical care to over 18,000 residents of Basilan. Humanitarian groups were able to continue their work without fear of further kidnappings and terrorists attacks by the Abu Sayyaf Group.

==Operation Enduring Freedom – Horn of Africa (OEF-HOA)==

Unlike other operations contained in Operation Enduring Freedom, OEF-HOA does not have a specific terrorist organization as a target. OEF-HOA instead focuses its efforts to disrupt and detect terrorist activities in the region and to work with host nations to deny the reemergence of terrorist cells and activities. Operations began in mid-2002 at Camp Lemonnier by a Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force (CJSOTF) augmented by support forces from Fort Stewart, Fort Hood, and Fort Story. In October 2002, the Combined Joint Task Force, Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) was established at Djibouti at Camp Lemonnier, taking over responsibilities from the CJSOTF. CJTF-HOA comprised approximately 2,000 personnel including U.S. military and Special Operations Forces (SOF), and coalition force members, Combined Task Force 150 (CTF-150). The coalition force consists of ships from Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Netherlands, India, Italy, Pakistan, New Zealand, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom. The primary goal of the coalition forces is to monitor, inspect, board and stop suspected shipments from entering the Horn of Africa region. Since 2003, the U.S. Military also conducts operations targeting Al-Qaeda-linked fighters in Somalia, these operations had reportedly killed between 113 and 136 militants by early 2016. On 7 March 2016, a further 150 were killed in U.S. airstrikes on an al Shabaab training camp north of Mogadishu.

CJTF-HOA has devoted the majority of its efforts to train selected armed forces units of the countries of Djibouti, Kenya and Ethiopia in counterterrorism and counterinsurgency tactics. Humanitarian efforts conducted by CJTF-HOA include the rebuilding of schools and medical clinics, as well as providing medical services to those countries whose forces are being trained. The program expands as part of the Trans-Saharan Counter Terrorism Initiative as CJTF personnel also assist in training the forces of Chad, Niger, Mauritania and Mali.

===U.S. action===
&quot;Operation Enduring Freedom&quot;

* 7 October 2001 – 28 December 2014

Anti-piracy operations were undertaken by the coalition throughout 2006 with a battle fought in March when US vessels were attacked by pirates. In January 2007, during the war in Somalia, an AC-130 airstrike was conducted against al-Qaeda members embedded with forces of the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) operating in southern Somalia near Ras Kamboni. US naval forces, including the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot;, were positioned off the coast of Somalia to provide support and to prevent any al-Qaeda forces escaping by sea. Actions against pirates also occurred in June and October 2007 with varying amounts of success.

&quot;Operation Resolute Support/Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel&quot;

<doc id="22739" wikidata="Q1150647" url="?curid=22739" title="Obfuscation (software)">
<text>In software development, obfuscation is the practice of creating source or machine code that is intentionally difficult for humans or computers to understand. Similar to obfuscation in natural language, code obfuscation may involve using unnecessarily roundabout ways to write statements. Programmers often obfuscate code to conceal its purpose, logic, or embedded values. The primary reasons for doing so are to prevent tampering, deter reverse engineering, or to create a puzzle or recreational challenge to deobfuscate the code, a challenge often included in crackmes. While obfuscation can be done manually, it is more commonly performed using obfuscators.

==Overview==
The architecture and characteristics of some languages may make them easier to obfuscate than others. C, C++, and the Perl programming language are some examples of languages easy to obfuscate. Haskell is also quite obfuscatable despite being quite different in structure.

The properties that make a language obfuscatable are not immediately obvious.

== Techniques ==

Types of obfuscations include simple keyword substitution, use or non-use of whitespace to create artistic effects, and self-generating or heavily compressed programs.

According to Nick Montfort, techniques may include:
# naming obfuscation, which includes naming variables in a meaningless or deceptive way;
# data/code/comment confusion, which includes making some actual code look like comments or confusing syntax with data;
# double coding, which can be displaying code in poetry form or interesting shapes.

=== Automated tools ===
A variety of tools exist to perform or assist with code obfuscation. These include experimental research tools developed by academics, hobbyist tools, commercial products written by professionals, and open-source software. Additionally, deobfuscation tools exist, aiming to reverse the obfuscation process.

While most commercial obfuscation solutions transform either program source code or platform-independent bytecode (as used by Java and .NET), some also work directly on compiled binaries.
* Some Python examples can be found in the official Python programming FAQ and elsewhere.
* The &quot;movfuscator&quot; C compiler for the x86_32 ISA uses only the &quot;mov&quot; instruction in order to obfuscate.

=== Recreational ===
Writing and reading obfuscated source code can be a brain teaser. A number of programming contests reward the most creatively obfuscated code, such as the International Obfuscated C Code Contest and the Obfuscated Perl Contest.

Short obfuscated Perl programs may be used in signatures of Perl programmers. These are JAPHs (&quot;Just another Perl hacker&quot;).

=== Cryptographic ===

Cryptographers have explored the idea of obfuscating code so that reverse-engineering the code is &quot;cryptographically&quot; hard. This is formalized in the many proposals for indistinguishability obfuscation, a cryptographic primitive that, if possible to build securely, would allow one to construct many other kinds of cryptography, including completely novel types that no one knows how to make. (A stronger notion, black-box obfuscation, is known to be impossible in general.)

==Disadvantages of obfuscation==
* While obfuscation can make reading, writing, and reverse-engineering a program difficult and time-consuming, it will not necessarily make it impossible.
* It adds time and complexity to the build process for the developers.
* It can make debugging issues after the software has been obfuscated extremely difficult.
* Once code is no longer maintained, hobbyists may want to maintain the program, add mods, or understand it better. Obfuscation makes it hard for end users to do useful things with the code.
* Certain kinds of obfuscation (i.e. code that isn&#x27;t just a local binary and downloads mini binaries from a web server as needed) can degrade performance and/or require Internet.

=== Notifying users of obfuscated code ===
Some anti-virus softwares, such as AVG AntiVirus, will also alert their users when they land on a website with code that is manually obfuscated, as one of the purposes of obfuscation can be to hide malicious code. However, some developers may employ code obfuscation for the purpose of reducing file size or increasing security. The average user may not expect their antivirus software to provide alerts about an otherwise harmless piece of code, especially from trusted corporations, so such a feature may actually deter users from using legitimate software.

Mozilla and Google disallow browser extensions containing obfuscated code in their add-ons store.

=== Obfuscation and copyleft licenses ===
There has been debate on whether it is illegal to skirt copyleft software licenses by releasing source code in obfuscated form, such as in cases in which the author is less willing to make the source code available. The issue is addressed in the GNU General Public License by requiring the &quot;preferred form for making modifications&quot; to be made available. The GNU website states &quot;Obfuscated &#x27;source code&#x27; is not real source code and does not count as source code.&quot;

== Decompilers ==
A decompiler is a tool that can reverse-engineer source code from an executable or library. This process is sometimes referred to as a man-in-the-end (mite) attack, inspired by the traditional &quot;man-in-the-middle attack&quot; in cryptography. The decompiled source code is often hard to read, containing random function and variable names, incorrect variable types, and logic that differs from the original source code due to compiler optimizations.

== Model obfuscation ==

Model obfuscation is a technique to hide the internal structure of a machine learning model. Obfuscation turns a model into a black box. It is contrary to explainable AI. Obfuscation models can also be applied to training data before feeding it into the model to add random noise. This hides sensitive information about the properties of individual and groups of samples.
