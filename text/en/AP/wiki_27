<text>Ugo Foscolo (; 6 February 177810 September 1827), born Niccolò Foscolo, was an Italian writer, revolutionary and poet.

He is especially remembered for his 1807 long poem &quot;Dei Sepolcri&quot;.

==Early life==
Foscolo was born in Zakynthos in the Ionian Islands. His father Andrea Foscolo was an impoverished Venetian nobleman and doctor, and his mother Diamantina Spathis was Greek.

In 1788, upon the death of his father, who worked as a physician in Spalato (present-day Split, Croatia), the family moved to Venice, and Foscolo completed the studies he began at the Dalmatian grammar school at the University of Padua.

Amongst his Paduan teachers was the Abbé Melchiore Cesarotti, whose version of &quot;Ossian&quot; was very popular in Italy, and who influenced Foscolo&#x27;s literary tastes; he knew both modern and Ancient Greek. His literary ambition revealed itself in the appearance in 1797 of his tragedy &quot;Tieste&quot;—a production that enjoyed a certain degree of success.

==Politics and poetry==
Foscolo, who, for unknown reasons, had changed his Christian name Niccolò to that of Ugo, began to take an active part in the stormy political discussions which the fall of the Republic of Venice had triggered. He was a prominent member of the national committees, and addressed an ode to Napoleon, expecting Napoleon to overthrow the Venetian oligarchy and create a free republic.

The Treaty of Campo Formio (17 October 1797), under which, the French having indeed forced the dissolution of the ancient Republic of Venice, then handed over the city and the Veneto to the Austrians (in exchange for the Austrian Netherlands) gave a rude shock to Foscolo, but did not quite destroy his hopes. The state of mind produced by that shock is reflected in his novel &quot;The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis&quot; (1798), which was described by the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; as a more politicized version of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#x27;s &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot;: &quot;for Foscolo&#x27;s hero embodies the mental sufferings and suicide of an undeceived Italian patriot just as Goethe&#x27;s hero places before us the too-delicate sensitiveness, embittering and at last cutting short the life of a private German scholar.&quot;

The story of Foscolo&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis&quot; had a groundwork of melancholy fact. Jacopo Ortis had been a real person; he was a young student from Padua, and committed suicide there under circumstances akin to those described by Foscolo.

Foscolo, like many of his contemporaries, had thought much about suicide. Cato the Younger and the many classical examples of self-destruction described in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot; appealed to the imaginations of young Italian patriots as they had to the heroes and heroines of the Gironde in France. In the case of Foscolo, as in that of Goethe, the effect produced on the writer&#x27;s mind by the composition of the work seems to have been beneficial. He had seen the ideal of a great national future rudely shattered; but he did not despair of his country, and sought relief in now turning to gaze on the ideal of a great national poet.

After the fall of Venice, Foscolo moved to Milan, where he formed a friendship with the older poet Giuseppe Parini, whom he later remembered with admiration and gratitude. In Milan, he published a selection of 12 Sonnets, blending the passionate sentiments shown in &quot;Ortis&quot; with classical control of language and rhythm.

Still hoping that his country would be freed by Napoleon, in 1799 Foscolo enlisted as a volunteer in the National Guard of Napoleon&#x27;s Cisalpine Republic, was wounded at Cento, near Bologna, and taken as prisoner to Modena. Liberated after the French armies took Modena, he took part in the battle of the Trebbia (1799) and was wounded again in defence of the siege of Genoa (1800). Following the battle of Marengo (1800), he returned to Milan, and there gave the last touches to his &quot;&quot;Ortis&quot;&quot;, published a translation of and commentary upon Callimachus, commenced a version of the &quot;Iliad&quot; and began his translation of Laurence Sterne&#x27;s &quot;A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy&quot;. He also took part in a failed memorandum intended to present a new model of unified Italian government to Napoleon.

In 1804, Foscolo returned to military service in Napoleon&#x27;s cause, attached to the Italian Division of Napoleon&#x27;s army, based in Boulogne-sur-Mer, as part of Napoleon&#x27;s invasion force against Britain. Foscolo himself was stationed in Valenciennes, where he fathered a daughter, Floriana, by Sophia St John Hamilton, daughter of Lady Mary Hamilton.

Following the defeat at Trafalgar (1805) and Napoleon&#x27;s abandonment of his plans for invasion, Foscolo returned to Italy in 1806. Before leaving France, however, Foscolo once again met Alessandro Manzoni in Paris. Some seven years younger, Manzoni was still living in the house of his mother Giulia Beccaria. Studies have noted very close analogies (textual, metrical and biographical) between the poetry of Foscolo and Manzoni in the period 1801 to 1803, such as those between Foscolo&#x27;s &quot;All&#x27;amica risanata&quot; (&quot;&quot;To the healed friend&quot;), an ode to Antonietta Fagnani Arese, and Manzoni&#x27;s &quot;Qual su le cinzie cime&quot; (&quot;Who, on the peaks of Cynthus&quot;)

In 1807, occasioned by Napoleon&#x27;s 1804 decree forbidding burials within city limits, Foscolo wrote his &quot;Dei Sepolcri&quot; (&quot;On Sepulchres&quot;), which may be described as his sublime effort to seek refuge in the past from the misery of the present and the darkness of the future. The mighty dead are summoned from their tombs, as ages before they had been in the masterpieces of Greek oratory, to fight again the battles of their country. 


In January 1809, Foscolo was appointed to the chair of Italian rhetoric at the University of Pavia. In Pavia, Foscolo resided at the Palazzo Cornazzani, later home to Contardo Ferrini, to Ada Negri and to Albert Einstein, respectively. His inaugural lecture &quot;On the origin and duty of literature&quot;, was conceived in the same spirit as his &quot;Dei Sepolcri&quot;. In his lecture, Foscolo urged his young countrymen to study literature, not in obedience to academic traditions, but in their relation to individual and national life and growth. 

The sensation produced by this lecture played no small part in provoking the decree of Napoleon by which the chair of rhetoric was abolished in all the Italian universities under Napoleonic control. Soon afterwards, in 1811 Foscolo&#x27;s tragedy of Ajax was presented at Milan, with little success; and because of its supposed allusions to Napoleon, he was forced in 1812 to move from Milan to Tuscany.
The chief fruits of his stay in Florence were the tragedy of &quot;Ricciarda&quot;, the &quot;Ode to the Graces&quot;, left unfinished, and the completion of his translation of Laurence Sterne&#x27;s &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot;, including his own fictional memoir &quot;Notizia intorno a Didimo Chierico&quot; (&quot;News concerning Didymus the cleric&quot;&quot;) (1813), covering much of the same ground as that of Sterne&#x27;s main character, the Reverend Yorick; which he (Foscolo) had begun during his service at Boulogne-sur-Mer. In his account of Didimo Chierico, Foscolo throws much light on his own character. His version of Sterne is an important feature in his personal history.

Foscolo returned to Milan in 1813, until the return of the Austrians in 1815; from there he passed into Switzerland, where he wrote a fierce satire in Latin on his political and literary opponents; and finally he sought the shores of England at the close of 1816.
==London==

During the eleven years spent by Foscolo in London, until his death there, he enjoyed all the social distinction which the most brilliant circles of the English capital could confer on foreigners of political and literary renown, and experienced all the misery which follows on from a disregard of the first conditions of domestic economy.

His contributions to the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; and &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, his dissertations in Italian on the text of Dante Alighieri and Giovanni Boccaccio, and still more his English essays on Petrarch (1821), of which the value was enhanced by Barbarina Brand&#x27;s admirable translations of some of Petrarch&#x27;s finest sonnets, heightened his previous fame as a Man of Letters. However, he was frequently accused of financial ineptitude, and ended up spending time in debtors&#x27; prison, which affected his social standing after his release.

According to the &quot;History of the County of Middlesex&quot;, the scientist and businessman William Allen hired Foscolo to teach Italian at the Quaker school he co-founded, the Newington Academy for Girls. His general bearing in society – as reported by Walter Scott – had not been such as to gain and retain lasting friendships. He died at Turnham Green on 10 September 1827, and was buried at St Nicholas Church, Chiswick, where his restored tomb remains to this day; it refers to him as the &quot;wearied citizen poet&quot;, and incorrectly states his age as 50. Forty-four years after his death, on 7 June 1871, his remains were exhumed at the request of the King of Italy and taken to Florence, where with all the pride, pomp and circumstance of a great national mourning, found their final resting-place beside the monuments of Niccolò Machiavelli and Vittorio Alfieri, of Michelangelo and Galileo, in the church of Santa Croce, the pantheon of Italian glory he had celebrated in &quot;Dei Sepolcri&quot;.

As noted by historian Lucy Riall, the glorification of Ugo Foscolo in the 1870s was part of the effort of the Italian government of this time (successful in completing the Italian unification but at the cost of a head-on confrontation with the Catholic Church) to create a gallery of &quot;secular saints&quot; to compete with those of the Church and sway popular feeling in favor of the newly created Italian state.

<text>Nephthys or Nebet-Het in ancient Egyptian () was a goddess in ancient Egyptian religion. A member of the Great Ennead of Heliopolis in Egyptian mythology, she was a daughter of Nut and Geb. Nephthys was typically paired with her sister Isis in funerary rites because of their role as protectors of the mummy, with her brother Osiris, and as the sister-wife of Set.

She was associated with mourning, the night/darkness, service (specifically temples), childbirth, the dead, protection, magic, health, embalming, and beer.

==Etymology==

Nephthys is the Greek form of an epithet (transliterated as &quot;Nebet-hut&quot;, &quot;Nebet-het&quot;, &quot;Nebt-het&quot;, from Egyptian &quot;nbt-ḥwt&quot;). The origin of the goddess Nephthys is unclear but the literal translation of her name is usually given as &quot;Lady of the House&quot; or &quot;Lady of the Temple.&quot;

This title, which may be more of an epithet describing her function than a given name, probably indicates the association of Nephthys with one particular temple or some specific aspect of the Egyptian temple ritual. Along with her sister Isis, Nephthys represented the temple pylon or trapezoidal tower gateway entrance to the temple which also displayed the flagstaff. This entrance way symbolized the horizon or akhet.

==Function==
At the time of the Fifth Dynasty Pyramid Texts, Nephthys appears as a goddess of the Heliopolitan Ennead. She is the sister of Isis and companion of the war-like deity, Set. As sister of Isis and especially Osiris, Nephthys is a protective goddess who symbolizes the death experience, just as Isis represented the birth experience. Nephthys was known in some ancient Egyptian temple theologies and cosmologies as the &quot;Helpful Goddess&quot; or the &quot;Excellent Goddess&quot;. These late ancient Egyptian temple texts describe a goddess who represented divine assistance and protective guardianship.

Nephthys is regarded as the mother of the funerary deity Anubis (Inpu) in some myths. Alternatively Anubis appears as the son of Bastet or Isis. In Nubia, Nephthys was said to be the wife of Anubis. 

Though usually considered the aunt of Horus, she often appears as his mother. She is also seen as a wife of Horus. As the primary &quot;nursing mother&quot; of the incarnate pharaonic god, Horus, Nephthys also was considered to be the nurse of the reigning pharaoh himself. Though other goddesses could assume this role, Nephthys was most usually portrayed in this function. In contrast, Nephthys is sometimes featured as a rather ferocious and dangerous divinity, capable of incinerating the enemies of the pharaoh with her fiery breath.

New Kingdom Ramesside Pharaohs, in particular, were enamored of &quot;Mother Nephthys&quot; as is attested in various stelae and a wealth of inscriptions at Karnak and Luxor, where Nephthys was a member of that great city&#x27;s Ennead and her altars were present in the massive complex.

Nephthys was typically paired with her sister Isis in funerary rites because of their role as protectors of the mummy and the god Osiris and as the sister-wife of Set. Less well understood than her sister Isis, Nephthys was no less important in Egyptian religion as confirmed by the work of E. Hornung along with the work of several noted scholars.

:Ascend and descend; descend with Nephthys, sink into darkness with the Night-bark. Ascend and descend; ascend with Isis, rise with the Day-bark. — &quot;Pyramid Text&quot; utterance 222, line 210

==Symbolism==

In the funerary role, Nephthys often was depicted as a kite or as a woman with falcon wings, usually outstretched as a symbol of protection. Nephthys&#x27;s association with the kite or the Egyptian hawk (and its piercing, mournful cries) evidently reminded the ancients of the lamentations usually offered for the dead by wailing women. In this capacity, it is easy to see how Nephthys could be associated with death and putrefaction in the Pyramid Texts. She was, almost without fail, depicted as crowned by the hieroglyphs signifying her name, which were a combination of signs for the sacred temple enclosure (&quot;ḥwt&quot;) along with the sign for &quot;nb&quot; or &quot;mistress (lady)&quot; on top of the enclosure sign.

Nephthys was clearly viewed as a morbid-but-crucial force of heavenly transition, i.e., the pharaoh becomes strong for his journey to the afterlife through the intervention of Isis and Nephthys. The same divine power could be applied later to all of the dead, who were advised to consider Nephthys a necessary companion. According to the Pyramid Texts, Nephthys, along with Isis, was a force before whom demons trembled in fear and whose magical spells were necessary for navigating the various levels of Duat, as the region of the afterlife was termed.

==Mythology and position in the pantheon==

Though it commonly has been assumed that Nephthys was married to Set and they have a son Anubis, recent Egyptological research has called this into question. Levai notes that while Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;De Iside et Osiride&quot; mentions the deities&#x27; marriage, there is very little specifically linking Nephthys and Set in the original early Egyptian sources. She argues that the later evidence suggests that:

while Nephthys&#x27;s marriage to Set was a part of Egyptian mythology, it was not a part of the myth of the murder and resurrection of Osiris. She was not paired with Set the villain, but with Set&#x27;s other aspect, the benevolent figure who was the killer of Apophis. This was the aspect of Set worshiped in the western oases during the Roman period, where he is depicted with Nephthys as co-ruler.

One of the few sources that explicitly identify Nephthys as the wife of Set within the context of the Osiris myth is Papyrus Berlin P. 8278. This text recounts an episodic part of the Osiris myth in which the men of Set and Horus engage in a military conflict, ultimately leading to Set’s expulsion from Egypt. After consuming the Eye of Horus and becoming intoxicated by it, Set attempts to anally penetrate Nephthys before being discovered by the gods and accused of murdering Osiris. Rather than responding to the accusations made by Isis or Thoth, Set instead laments that the gods have separated him from Nephthys, whom he refers to as the &quot;female donkey,&quot; just as he had grabbed her by the tail and was about to penetrate her—insisting that she rightfully belonged to him as his wife.

It is Nephthys who assists Isis in gathering and mourning the dismembered portions of the body of Osiris after his murder by the envious Set. Nephthys also serves as the nursemaid and watchful guardian of the infant Horus. The Pyramid Texts refer to Isis as the &quot;birth-mother&quot; and to Nephthys as the &quot;nursing-mother&quot; of Horus. Nephthys was attested as one of the four &quot;Great Chiefs&quot; ruling in the Osirian cult center of Busiris in the Delta and she appears to have occupied an honorary position at the holy city of Abydos. No cult is attested for her there, though she certainly figured as a goddess of great importance in the annual rites conducted, wherein two chosen females or priestesses played the roles of Isis and Nephthys and performed the elaborate &quot;Lamentations of Isis and Nephthys&quot;. There, at Abydos, Nephthys joined Isis as a mourner in the shrine known as the Osireion. These &quot;Festival Songs of Isis and Nephthys&quot; were ritual elements of many such Osirian rites in major ancient Egyptian cult centers.

As a mortuary goddess like Isis, Neith, and Serqet, Nephthys was one of the protectresses of the canopic jars of Hapi. Hapi, one of the sons of Horus, guarded the embalmed lungs. Thus we find Nephthys endowed with the epithet &quot;Nephthys of the Bed of Life&quot; in direct reference to her regenerative priorities on the embalming table. In the city of Memphis, Nephthys was duly honored with the title &quot;Queen of the Embalmer&#x27;s Shop&quot; and there associated with the jackal-headed god Anubis as patron.

Nephthys was also considered a festive deity whose rites could mandate the liberal consumption of beer. In various reliefs at Edfu, Dendera, and Behbeit, Nephthys is depicted receiving lavish beer offerings from the pharaoh which she would &quot;return&quot; using her power as a beer goddess &quot;that [the pharaoh] may have joy with no hangover&quot;. Elsewhere at Edfu, for example, Nephthys is a goddess who gives the pharaoh power to see &quot;that which is hidden by moonlight&quot;. This fits well with more general textual themes that consider Nephthys to be a goddess whose unique domain was darkness or the perilous edges of the desert.

Nephthys could also appear as one of the goddesses who assists at childbirth. An ancient Egyptian myth preserved in the Papyrus Westcar recounts the story of Isis, Nephthys, Meskhenet, and Heqet as traveling dancers in disguise, assisting the wife of a priest of Amun-Re as she prepares to bring forth sons who are destined for fame and fortune.

Nephthys&#x27;s healing skills and status as direct counterpart of Isis, steeped, as her sister in &quot;words of power&quot;, are evidenced by the abundance of faience amulets carved in her likeness and by her presence in a variety of magical papyri that sought to summon her famously altruistic qualities to the aid of mortals.

==New Kingdom cults==
The Ramesside pharaohs were particularly devoted to Set&#x27;s prerogatives and, in the 19th Dynasty, a temple of Nephthys called the &quot;House of Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun&quot; was built or refurbished in the town of Sepermeru, midway between Oxyrhynchus and Herakleopolis, on the outskirts of the Fayyum and quite near to the modern site of Deshasheh. Here, as Papyrus Wilbour notes in its wealth of taxation records and land assessments, the temple of Nephthys was a specific foundation by Ramesses II, located in close proximity to (or within) the precinct of the enclosure of Set. To be certain, the House of Nephthys was one of fifty individual, land-owning temples delineated for this portion of the Middle Egyptian district in Papyrus Wilbour. The fields and other holdings belonging to Nephthys&#x27;s temple were under the authority of two Nephthys prophets (named Penpmer and Merybarse) and one (mentioned) wa&#x27;ab priest of the goddess.

While certainly affiliated with the &quot;House of Set&quot;, the Nephthys temple at Sepermeru and its apportioned lands (several acres) clearly were under administration distinct from the Set institution. The Nephthys temple was a unique establishment in its own right, an independent entity. According to Papyrus Wilbour, another &quot;House of Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun&quot; seems to have existed to the north, in the town of Su, closer to the Fayyum region.

Another temple of Nephthys seems to have existed in the town of Punodjem. The Papyrus Bologna records a complaint lodged by a prophet of the temple of Set in that town regarding undue taxation in his regard. After making an introductory appeal to &quot;Re-Horakhte, Set, and Nephthys&quot; for the ultimate resolution of this issue by the royal Vizier, the prophet (named Pra&#x27;emhab) laments his workload. He notes his obvious administration of the &quot;House of Set&quot; and adds: &quot;I am also responsible for the ship, and I am responsible likewise for the House of Nephthys, along with a heap of other temples.&quot;

As &quot;Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun&quot;, the goddess and her shrines were under the particular endorsement of Ramesses II. The foundations of the Set and Nephthys temples at Sepermeru finally were discovered and identified in the 1980s and the Nephthys temple was a self-sustaining temple complex within the Set enclosure.

There can be little doubt that a cult of Nephthys existed in the temple and great town of Herakleopolis, north of Sepermeru. A near life-sized statue of Nephthys (currently housed in the Louvre) boasts a curiously altered inscription. The basalt image originally was stationed at Medinet-Habu as part of the cultic celebration of the pharaonic &quot;Sed-Festival&quot;, but was transferred at some point to Herakleopolis and the temple of Herishef. The cult-image&#x27;s inscription originally pertained to &quot;Nephthys, Foremost of the Sed [Festival] in the Booth of Annals&quot; (at Medinet-Habu), but was re-inscribed or re-dedicated to &quot;Nephthys, Foremost of the [Booths of] Herakleopolis&quot;. A &quot;prophet of Nephthys&quot; is indeed attested for the town of Herakleopolis in the 30th Dynasty.

==Chief goddess of Nome VII==

Nephthys was considered the unique protectress of the Bennu bird. This role may have stemmed from an early association in her native Heliopolis which was renowned for its &quot;House of the Bennu&quot; temple. In this role, Nephthys was given the name &quot;Nephthys-Kheresket&quot; and a wealth of temple texts from Edfu, Dendera, Philae, Kom Ombo, El Qa&#x27;la, Esna, and others corroborate the late identification of Nephthys as the supreme goddess of Upper Egyptian Nome VII, where another shrine existed in honor of the Bennu. Nephthys also was the goddess of the &quot;Mansion of the Sistrum&quot; in Hwt-Sekhem (Gr. Diospolis Parva), the chief city of Nome VII. There, Nephthys was the primary protectress of the resident Osirian relic, of the Bennu Bird, and of the local Horus/Osiris manifestation, the god Neferhotep.

Nephthys was most widely and usually worshiped in ancient Egypt as part of a consortium of temple deities. Therefore, it should not be surprising that her cult images could likely be found as part of the divine entourage in temples at Kharga, Kellis, Deir el-Hagar, Koptos, Dendera, Philae, Sebennytos, Busiris, Shenhur, El Qa&#x27;la, Letopolis, Heliopolis, Abydos, Thebes, Dakleh Oasis, and indeed throughout Egypt. In most cases, Nephthys found her typical place as part of a triad alongside Osiris and Isis, Isis and Horus, Isis and Min, or as part of a quartet of deities.

<text>The National Flag of Canada (), often referred to simply as the Canadian flag, consists of a red field with a white square at its centre in the ratio of , in which is featured one stylized, red, 11-pointed maple leaf charged in the centre. It is the first flag to have been adopted by both houses of Parliament and officially proclaimed by the Canadian monarch as the country&#x27;s official national flag. The flag has become the predominant and most recognizable national symbol of Canada.

In 1964, Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson formed a committee to resolve the ongoing issue of the lack of an official Canadian flag, sparking a debate about a flag change to replace the Union Flag. Out of three choices, the maple leaf design by Mount Allison University historian George Stanley, based on the flag of the Royal Military College of Canada, was selected. The flag officially appeared on February 15, 1965; the date is now celebrated annually as National Flag of Canada Day.

Before 1965, the Canadian Red Ensign had been in unofficial use since the 1860s and was later officially approved by a 1945 Order in Council for use &quot;wherever place or occasion may make it desirable to fly a distinctive Canadian flag&quot;. Also, the Royal Union Flag remains an official flag in Canada, to symbolize Canada&#x27;s allegiance to the monarch and membership in the Commonwealth of Nations. There is no law dictating how the national flag is to be treated, but there are conventions and protocols to guide how it is to be displayed and its place in the order of precedence of flags, which gives it primacy over the aforementioned and most other flags.

Many different flags created by Canadian officials, government bodies, and military forces contain the maple leaf motif in some fashion, either by having the Canadian flag charged in the canton or by including maple leaves in the design. The Canadian flag also appears on the government&#x27;s wordmark.

==Origins and design==

The flag is horizontally symmetric, so the obverse and reverse sides appear identical. The width of the Maple Leaf flag is twice the height. The white field is a Canadian pale (a central band occupying half the width of a vertical triband flag, rather than a third of the width, named for its use in this flag); each bordering red field is exactly half its size and it bears a stylized red maple leaf at its centre. In heraldic terminology, the flag&#x27;s blazon as outlined on the original royal proclamation is &quot;gules on a Canadian pale argent a maple leaf of the first&quot;.

The maple leaf has been a Canadian emblem since the 18th century. It was first used as a national symbol in 1868 when it appeared on the coat of arms of both Ontario and Quebec. In 1867, Alexander Muir composed the patriotic song &quot;The Maple Leaf Forever&quot;, which became an unofficial anthem in English-speaking Canada. The maple leaf was later added to the Canadian coat of arms in 1921. From 1876 until 1901, the leaf appeared on all Canadian coins and remained on the penny after 1901. The use of the maple leaf by the Royal Canadian Regiment as a regimental symbol extended back to 1860. During the First and Second World Wars, badges of the Canadian forces were often based on a maple leaf design. The maple leaf would eventually adorn the tombstones of Canadian military graves.

By proclaiming the Royal Arms of Canada, King George V in 1921 made red and white the official colours of Canada; the former came from Saint George&#x27;s Cross and the latter from the French royal emblem since King Charles VII. These colours became &quot;entrenched&quot; as the national colours of Canada upon the proclamation of the Royal Standard of Canada (the Canadian monarch&#x27;s personal flag) in 1962. The Department of Canadian Heritage has listed the various colour shades for printing ink that should be used when reproducing the Canadian flag; these include:
* FIP red: General Printing Ink, No. 0-712;
* Inmont Canada Ltd., No. 4T51577;
* Monarch Inks, No. 62539/0
* Rieger Inks, No. 25564
* Sinclair and Valentine, No. RL163929/0.

The number of points on the leaf has no special significance; the number and arrangement of the points were chosen after wind tunnel tests showed the current design to be the least blurry of the various designs when tested under high-wind conditions.

The image of the maple leaf used on the flag was designed by Jacques Saint-Cyr; Jack Cook claims that this stylized eleven-point maple leaf was lifted from a copyrighted design owned by a Canadian craft shop in Ottawa. The colours 0/100/100/0 in the CMYK process, PMS 032 (flag red 100%), or PMS 485 (used for screens) in the Pantone colour specifier can be used when reproducing the flag. For the Federal Identity Program, the red tone of the standard flag has an RGB value of 255–0–0 (web hexadecimal #FF0000). In 1984, the National Flag of Canada Manufacturing Standards Act was passed to unify the manufacturing standards for flags used in both indoor and outdoor conditions.

==History==

===Early flags===

The Saint George&#x27;s Cross was carried by John Cabot when he reached the later-named Newfoundland in 1497. In 1534, Jacques Cartier planted a cross in Gaspé bearing the French royal coat of arms with the fleurs-de-lis. The Royal Banner of France or &quot;Bourbon Flag&quot; held a position of some prominence in New France, with the evolving variations of French military flags being used over time.

 As the &quot;&quot; British national flag, the Union Flag (commonly known as the &quot;Union Jack&quot;) was used similarly in Canada from the time of British settlement in Nova Scotia after 1621. Its use continued after Canada&#x27;s legislative independence from the United Kingdom in 1931 until the adoption of the current flag in 1965. The United Empire Loyalist flag, that is very similar to the Union Jack, was used by immigrants who remained loyal to the British crown during the American Revolutionary War. In present-day Canada, the United Empire Loyalist flag continues to be used as symbol of pride and heritage for loyalist townships and organizations.

Shortly after Canadian Confederation in 1867, the need for distinctive Canadian flags emerged. The first Canadian flag was then used as the flag of the governor general of Canada, a Union Flag with a shield in the centre bearing the quartered arms of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, surrounded by a wreath of maple leaves. In 1870, the Red Ensign, with the addition of the Canadian composite shield in the fly, began to be used unofficially on land and sea and was known as the &quot;Canadian Red Ensign&quot;. As new provinces joined the Confederation, their arms were added to the shield. In 1892, the British admiralty approved the use of the Red Ensign for Canadian use at sea. 
The composite shield was replaced with the coat of arms of Canada upon its grant in 1921, and in 1924, an Order in Council approved its use for Canadian government buildings abroad. In 1925, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King established a committee to design a flag to be used at home, but it was dissolved before the final report could be delivered. Despite the failure of the committee to solve the issue, public sentiment in the 1920s was in favour of fixing the flag problem for Canada. New designs were proposed in 1927, 1931, and 1939.

By the Second World War, the Red Ensign was viewed as Canada&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; national flag. A joint committee of the Senate and House of Commons was appointed on November 8, 1945, to recommend a national flag to officially adopt. It received 2,409 designs from the public and was addressed by the director of the Historical Section of the Canadian Army, Archer Fortescue Duguid, who pointed out that red and white were Canada&#x27;s official colours and there was already an emblem representing the country: three joined maple leaves seen on the escutcheon of the Canadian coat of arms. By May 9 the following year, the committee reported back with a recommendation &quot;that the national flag of Canada should be the Canadian red ensign with a maple leaf in autumn golden colours in a bordered background of white&quot;. The Legislative Assembly of Quebec had urged the committee not to include any of what it deemed as &quot;foreign symbols&quot;, including the Union Flag, and Mackenzie King, then still prime minister, declined to act on the report; fearing it may lead to political instability. As a result, the Union Flag was kept as a national flag, and the order to fly the Canadian Red Ensign at government buildings was maintained.

===Great Flag Debate===

By the 1960s, the debate for an official Canadian flag intensified and became controversial, culminating in the Great Flag Debate of 1964. In 1963, the minority Liberal government of Lester B. Pearson gained power and decided to adopt an official Canadian flag through parliamentary debate. The principal political proponent of the change was Pearson. He had been a significant broker during the Suez Crisis of 1956, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. During the crisis, Pearson was disturbed when the Egyptian government objected to Canadian peacekeeping forces because the Canadian flag (the Red Ensign) contained the same symbol (the Union Flag) also used as a flag by the United Kingdom, one of the belligerents. Pearson&#x27;s goal was to create a Canadian flag that was distinctive and unmistakably Canadian. The main opponent to changing the flag was the leader of the opposition and former prime minister, John Diefenbaker, who eventually made the subject a personal crusade.
In 1961, Leader of the Opposition Lester Pearson asked John Ross Matheson to begin researching what it would take for Canada to have a new flag. By April 1963, Pearson was prime minister in a minority government and risked losing power over the issue. He formed a 15-member multi-party parliamentary committee in 1963 to select a new design, despite opposition leader Diefenbaker&#x27;s demands for a referendum on the issue. On May 27, 1964, Pearson&#x27;s cabinet introduced a motion to parliament for the adoption of his favourite design, presented to him by artist and heraldic advisor Alan Beddoe, of a &quot;sea to sea&quot; (Canada&#x27;s motto) flag with blue borders and three conjoined red maple leaves on a white field. This motion led to weeks of acrimonious debate in the House of Commons and the design came to be known as the &quot;Pearson Pennant&quot;, derided by the media and viewed as a &quot;concession to Québec&quot;.
A new all-party committee was formed in September 1964, comprising seven Liberals, five Conservatives, one New Democrat, one Social Crediter, and one Créditiste, with Herman Batten as chairman, while John Matheson acted as Pearson&#x27;s right-hand man. Among those who gave their opinions to the group was Duguid, expressing the same views as he had in 1945, insisting on a design using three maple leaves; Arthur R. M. Lower, stressing the need for a distinctly Canadian emblem; Marcel Trudel, arguing for symbols of Canada&#x27;s founding nations, which did not include the maple leaf (a thought shared by Diefenbaker); and A. Y. Jackson, providing his own suggested designs. A steering committee also considered about 2,000 suggestions from the public, in addition to 3,900 others that included, according to Library and Archives Canada, &quot;those that had accumulated in the Department of the Secretary of State and those from a parliamentary flag committee of 1945–1946&quot;. Through six weeks of study with political manoeuvring, the committee took a vote on the two finalists: the Pearson Pennant (Beddoe&#x27;s design) and the current design. Believing the Liberal members would vote for the Prime Minister&#x27;s preference, the Conservatives voted for the single leaf design. The Liberals, though, all voted for the single leaf design, as did the members from the other two parties, giving a unanimous 15 to 0 vote for the option created by George Stanley and inspired by the flag of the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) in Kingston, Ontario.
There, near the parade square, in March 1964, while viewing the college flag atop the Mackenzie Building, Stanley, then RMC&#x27;s Dean of Arts, first suggested to Matheson, then Member of Parliament for Leeds, that the RMC flag should form the basis of the national flag. The suggestion was followed by Stanley&#x27;s memorandum of March 23, 1964, on the history of Canada&#x27;s emblems, in which he warned that any new flag &quot;must avoid the use of national or racial symbols that are of a divisive nature&quot; and that it would be &quot;clearly inadvisable&quot; to create a flag that carried the Union Flag or a fleur-de-lis. According to Matheson, Pearson&#x27;s &quot;paramount and desperate objective&quot; in introducing the new flag was keeping Quebec in Canada. It was Stanley&#x27;s idea that the new flag should be red and white and that it should feature the single maple leaf; his memorandum included the first sketch of what would become the flag of Canada. Stanley and Matheson collaborated on a design that was, after six months of debate and 308 speeches, passed by a majority vote in the House of Commons on December 15, 1964. Just after this, at 2:00 am, Matheson wrote to Stanley: &quot;Your proposed flag has just now been approved by the Commons 163 to 78. Congratulations. I believe it is an excellent flag that will serve Canada well.&quot; The Senate added its approval two days later.

===Proclamation===
After the resolutions proposing a new national flag for Canada were passed by the two houses of parliament, a proclamation was drawn up for signature by the Queen of Canada. This was created in the form of an illuminated document on vellum, with calligraphy by Yvonne Diceman and heraldic illustrations. The text was rendered in black ink, using a quill, while the heraldic elements were painted in gouache with gilt highlights. The Great Seal of Canada was embossed and secured by a silk ribbon.
This parchment was signed discreetly by the calligrapher but was made official by the signatures of Queen Elizabeth II (given on January 28, 1965), Prime Minister Lester Pearson, and Attorney General Guy Favreau. In order to obtain these signatures, the document was flown to the United Kingdom (for the Queen&#x27;s royal sign-manual) and to the Caribbean (for the signature of Favreau, who was on vacation). This transport to different climates, combined with the quality of the materials with which the proclamation was created and the subsequent storage and repair methods (including the use of Scotch Tape), contributed to the deterioration of the document: The gouache was flaking off, leaving gaps in the heraldic designs, most conspicuously on the red maple leaf of the flag design in the centre of the sheet, and the adhesive from the tape had left stains. A desire to have the proclamation as part of a display at the Canadian Museum of Civilization marking the flag&#x27;s 25th anniversary led to its restoration in 1989. The proclamation is today stored in a temperature and humidity-controlled plexiglass case to prevent the vellum from changing dimensionally.

===Adoption===
The new national flag was inaugurated on February 15, 1965, at an official ceremony held on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, in the presence of Governor General Major-General Georges Vanier, the Prime Minister, other members of the Cabinet, and Canadian parliamentarians. The Red Ensign was lowered at the stroke of noon, and the new maple leaf flag was raised. The crowd sang &quot;O Canada&quot; followed by &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;. Of the flag, Vanier said &quot;[it] will symbolize to each of us—and to the world—the unity of purpose and high resolve to which destiny beckons us&quot;. Maurice Bourget, Speaker of the Senate, said: &quot;The flag is the symbol of the nation&#x27;s unity, for it, beyond any doubt, represents all the citizens of Canada without distinction of race, language, belief, or opinion.&quot; Yet there was still opposition to the change, and Stanley&#x27;s life was even threatened for having &quot;assassinated the flag&quot;. Despite this, Stanley attended the flag-raising ceremony.

At the time of the 50th anniversary of the flag in 2015, the government—held by the Conservative Party—was criticized for the lack of an official ceremony dedicated to the date; accusations of partisanship were levelled. Minister of Canadian Heritage Shelly Glover denied the charges, and others, including Liberal Members of Parliament, pointed to community events taking place around the country. Governor General David Johnston did, though, preside at an official ceremony at Confederation Park in Ottawa, integrated with Winterlude. He said, &quot;[t]he National Flag of Canada is so embedded in our national life and so emblematic of our national purpose that we simply cannot imagine our country without it.&quot; Queen Elizabeth II stated: &quot;On this, the 50th anniversary of the National Flag of Canada, I am pleased to join with all Canadians in the celebration of this unique and cherished symbol of our country and identity.&quot; A commemorative stamp and coin were issued by Canada Post and the Royal Canadian Mint, respectively.

==Alternative flags==
As a symbol of the nation&#x27;s membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and allegiance to the Crown, the Royal Union Flag is an official Canadian flag and is flown on certain occasions. Regulations require federal installations to fly the Royal Union Flag beside the national flag when physically possible, using a second flagpole, on the following days: Commonwealth Day (the second Monday in March), Victoria Day (the same date as the Canadian sovereign&#x27;s official birthday), and the anniversary of the Statute of Westminster (December 11). The Royal Union Flag can also be flown at the National War Memorial or at other locations during ceremonies that honour Canadian involvement with forces of other Commonwealth nations during times of war. The national flag always precedes the Royal Union Flag, with the former occupying the place of honour.

The Royal Union Flag is also part of the provincial flags of Ontario and Manitoba, forming the canton of these flags; a stylized version is used on the flag of British Columbia and the flag of Newfoundland and Labrador. Several of the provincial lieutenant governors formerly used a modified union flag as their standard. The last to abolish this design was the lieutenant governor of Nova Scotia in 2024.

The Royal Standard of Canada (banner of arms) is an official flag introduced May 6, 2023, and first flown at Government House, Halifax, that day.

The Red Ensign is occasionally still used, including official use at some ceremonies. It was flown at the commemorations of the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 2007. This decision elicited criticism from those who believed it should not have been given equal status to the Canadian flag and received praise from people who believed that it was important to retain the ties to Canada&#x27;s past. The Royal Union Flag and Red Ensign are still flown in Canada by veterans&#x27; groups and others who continue to stress the importance of Canada&#x27;s British heritage and the Commonwealth connection.

In Quebec, the provincial flag (a white cross on a field of blue with four fleurs-de-lis) can be considered a national flag along with the Maple Leaf flag, as is the Acadian flag in the Acadian regions of the Maritime provinces. Public display of Canadian flags is rare in Quebec, with most Quebecers preferring to fly the flag of Quebec instead. Display of the flag is also contentious, with the Quebec provincial government ordering that the Quebec flag be given seniority over the Canadian one in the province, and many Quebec government facilities, such as the Quebec City Hall, the headquarters of the Sûreté du Québec and SAAQ, and the Quebec Parliament, refusing to fly the Canadian flag at all.

==Protocol==
No law dictates the proper use of the Canadian flag. Canadian Heritage has released rules for flying the National Flag of Canada alone and with other flags. The rules deal with the order of precedence in which the Canadian flag is placed, where the flag can be used, how it is used, and what people should do to honour the flag. The suggestions, titled &quot;National Flag of Canada Etiquette,&quot; were published by Canadian Heritage online and last updated in 24 February 2022. Canadian Forces also have a unique protocol for folding the Canadian flag for presentations, such as during a funeral ceremony; CF does not recommend this method for everyday use.

The flag can be displayed on any day at buildings operated by the Government of Canada, airports, military bases, diplomatic offices, and citizens during any time of the day. When flying the flag, it should be flown using its pole and should not be inferior to other flags, save for, in descending order, the King&#x27;s standard, the governor general&#x27;s standard, any of the personal standards of members of the Canadian Royal Family, or flags of the lieutenant governors. The Canadian flag is flown at half-mast in Canada to indicate a period of mourning.

==Promoting the flag==

Since the Canadian flag was adopted in 1965, the Canadian government has sponsored programs to promote it. Examples include the Canadian Parliamentary Flag Program of the Department of Canadian Heritage and the flag program run by the Department of Public Works. These programs increased the exposure of the flag and the concept that it was part of the national identity. To raise awareness of the new flag, the Parliamentary Flag Program was set up in December 1972 by the Cabinet and, beginning in 1973, allowed members of the House of Commons to distribute flags and lapel pins in the shape of the Canadian flag to their constituents. Full-size flags that have been flown on Peace Tower and four other locations on Parliament Hill are packaged by the Department of Public Works and offered to the public free of charge. As of March 2019, the program has a waiting list of over 100 years for both Peace Tower flags, which are in size, and for flags from the other four locations (one on each side of Centre Block and one each over East and West Blocks), which are .

Since 1996, February 15 has been commemorated as National Flag of Canada Day. In 1996, Minister of Canadian Heritage Sheila Copps instituted the One in a Million National Flag Challenge. Canadian Heritage put the expenses at $15.5 million, with approximately a seventh of the cost offset by donations. 

In February 2025, in the lead up to the 60th anniversary of the Canadian maple leaf flag, former prime ministers Kim Campbell, Jean Chrétien, Joe Clark, Stephen Harper and Paul Martin encouraged Canadians to show national pride and fly the flag &quot;like never before&quot; in the light of &quot;threats and insults&quot; to Canadian sovereignty by United States President Donald Trump.

<text>A multiple-unit train (or multiple unit (MU)) is a self-propelled train composed of one or more carriages joined, and where one or more of the carriages have the means of propulsion built in. By contrast, a locomotive-hauled train has all of the carriages unpowered.

An implication of this is that all the powered carriages needs to be controllable by a single engineer or driver, which is a case of the broader concept of multiple-unit train control. In other words, all &quot;multiple units&quot; employ some variation of multiple-unit train control. In the broader context &quot;unit&quot; means any powered rail vehicle, including locomotives (that does not carry cargo) and powered cargo-carrying carriages. In the context of this article, &quot;unit&quot; refers specifically to the latter only (whether the cargo is passengers or some other cargo).

What follows is that if coupled to another multiple unit, all MUs can still be controlled by the single driver, with multiple-unit train control.

Although multiple units consist of several carriages, single self-propelled carriages – also called railcars, rail motor coaches or railbuses – are in fact multiple units when two or more of them are working connected through multiple-unit train control (regardless of whether passengers can walk between the units or not).

==History==
Multiple-unit train control was first used in electric multiple units in the 1890s.

The Liverpool Overhead Railway opened in 1893 with two-car electric multiple units, controllers in cabs at both ends directly controlling the traction current to motors on both cars.

The multiple-unit traction control system was developed by Frank Sprague and first applied and tested on the South Side Elevated Railroad (now part of the Chicago &#x27;L&#x27;) in 1897. In 1895, derived from his company&#x27;s invention and production of direct-current elevator control systems, Frank Sprague invented a multiple-unit controller for electric train operation. This accelerated the construction of electric-traction railways and trolley systems worldwide. Each car of the train has its own traction motors: by means of motor control relays in each car energized by train-line wires from the front car, all the traction motors in the train are controlled in unison.

==Design==
Most MUs are powered either by traction motors, receiving their power through a third rail or overhead wire (EMU), or by a diesel engine (DMU) driving a generator producing electricity to drive traction motors.

A MU has the same power and traction components as a locomotive, but instead of the components being concentrated in one car, they are spread throughout the cars that make up the unit. In many cases these cars can only propel themselves when they are part of the unit, so they are semi-permanently coupled. For example, in a DMU one car might carry the prime mover and traction motors, and another the engine for head-end power generation; an EMU might have one car carry the pantograph and transformer, and another car carry the traction motors.

MU cars can be a motor or trailer car, it is not necessary for every one to be motorized. Trailer cars can contain supplementary equipment such as air compressors, batteries, etc.; they may also be fitted with a driving cab.

In most cases, MU trains can only be driven/controlled from dedicated cab cars. However, in some MU trains, every car is equipped with a driving console, and other controls necessary to operate the train, therefore every car can be used as a cab car whether it is motorised or not, if on the end of the train. An example of this arrangement is the NJ Transit Arrows.

==Passenger multiple units==
Virtually all rapid-transit rolling stock, such as on the New York City Subway, the London Underground, the Paris Metro and other subway systems, are multiple-units, usually EMUs. Most trains in the Netherlands and Japan are MUs, being suitable for use in areas of high population density.

Many high-speed rail trains are also multiple-units, such as the Japanese &quot;Shinkansen&quot; and the German Intercity-Express ICE 3 high-speed trains. A new high-speed MU, the AGV, was unveiled by France&#x27;s Alstom on 5 February 2008. It has a claimed service speed of 360 km/h (220 mph). India&#x27;s ICF announced the country&#x27;s first high-speed engine-less train named &#x27;train 18&#x27;, which would run at 250 km/h maximum speed.

==Freight multiple units==
This section is specifically about multiple units for freight traffic. For freight traffic powered through multiple locomotive &quot;units&quot;, see Multiple-unit train control and Distributed power.

Multiple units have been occasionally used for freight traffic, such as carrying containers or for trains used for maintenance. The Japanese M250 series train has four front and end carriages that are EMUs, and has been operating since March 2004. The German CargoSprinter have been used in three countries since 2003.

==Comparison to locomotive-hauled trains==
===Advantages===

====Energy efficiency====
They are more energy-efficient than locomotive-hauled trains. 

====Gradients====
They have better adhesion, as more of the train&#x27;s weight is carried on driven wheels, rather than the locomotive having to haul the dead weight of unpowered coaches.

====Acceleration====
They have a higher power-to-weight-ratio than a locomotive-hauled train since they don&#x27;t have a heavy locomotive that does not itself carry passengers, but contributes to the total weight of the train. This is particularly important where train services make frequent stops, since the energy consumed for accelerating the train increases significantly with an increase in weight. Because of the energy efficiency and higher adhesive-weight-to-total-weight ratio values, they generally have higher acceleration ability than locomotive-type trains and are favored in urban trains and metro systems for frequent start/stop routines.

====Turnaround times====
Most of them have cabs at both ends, resulting in quicker turnaround times, reduced crewing costs, and enhanced safety. The faster turnaround time and the reduced size (due to higher frequencies) as compared to large locomotive-hauled trains, has made the MU a major part of suburban commuter rail services in many countries. MUs are also used by most rapid transit systems. However, the need to turn a locomotive is no longer a problem for locomotive-hauled trains due to the increasing use of push pull trains.

====Failure====
Multiple units may usually be quickly made up or separated into sets of varying lengths. Several multiple units may run as a single train, then be broken at a junction point into shorter trains for different destinations. As there are multiple engines/motors, the failure of one engine does not prevent the train from continuing its journey. A locomotive-drawn train typically has only one power unit, whose failure will disable the train. However, some locomotive-hauled trains may contain more than one power unit and thus be able to continue at reduced speed after the failure of one.

====Axle loads====
They have lighter axle loads, allowing operation on lighter tracks, where locomotives may be banned. Another side effect of this is reduced track wear, as traction forces can be provided through many axles, rather than just the four or six of a locomotive. They generally have rigid couplers instead of the flexible ones often used on locomotive-hauled trains. That means brakes/throttle can be more quickly applied without an excessive amount of jerk experienced in passenger coaches. In a locomotive-hauled train, if the number of cars is changed to meet the demand, acceleration and braking performance will also change. This calls for performance calculations to be done taking the heaviest train composition into account. This may sometimes cause some trains in off-peak periods to be overpowered with respect to the required performance. When 2 or more multiple units are coupled, train performance remains almost unchanged. However, in locomotive-hauled train compositions, using more powerful locomotives when a train is longer can solve this problem.

===Disadvantages===

====Maintenance====
It may be easier to maintain one locomotive than many self-propelled cars. In the past, it was often safer to locate the train&#x27;s power systems away from passengers. This was particularly the case for steam locomotives, but still has some relevance for casualties than one with a locomotive (where the heavy locomotive would act as a &quot;crumple zone&quot;).

====Failure====
If a locomotive fails, it can be easily replaced with minimal shunting movements. There would be no need for passengers to evacuate the train. Failure of a multiple unit will often require a whole new train and time-consuming switching activities; also passengers would be asked to evacuate the failed train and board another one. However, if the train consists of more than one multiple unit they are often designed such that in the event of the failure of one unit others in the train can tow it in neutral if brakes and other safety systems are operational.

====Idle trains====
Idle trains do not waste expensive motive power resources. Separate locomotives mean that the costly motive power assets can be moved around as needed and also used for hauling freight trains. A multiple unit arrangement would limit these costly motive power resources to use in passenger transportation.

====Passage between units====
It is difficult to have gangway connections between coupled units and still retain an aerodynamic leading front end. Because of this, there is usually no passage between high-speed coupled units, though lower-speed coupled units frequently have connections between coupled units. This may require more crew members, so that ticket inspectors, for example, can be present in all of them. This leads to higher operating costs and lower use of crew resources. In a locomotive-hauled train, one crew can serve the train regardless of the number of cars in the train provided limits of individual workload are not exceeded. Likewise, in such instances, buffet cars and other shared passenger facilities may need to be duplicated in each unit, reducing efficiency.

====Flexibility====
Large locomotives can be used instead of small locomotives where more power is needed. Also, different types of passenger cars (such as reclining-seats, compartment cars, couchettes, sleepers, restaurant cars, buffet cars, etc.) can be easily added to or removed from a locomotive-drawn train. This is not so easy for a multiple unit, since individual cars can be attached or detached only in a maintenance facility. This also allows a loco-hauled train to be flexible in terms of number of cars. Cars can be removed or added one by one, but on multiple units two or more units have to be coupled. This is not so flexible.

====Noise====
The passenger environment of a multiple unit is often noticeably noisier than that of a locomotive-hauled train, due to the presence of underfloor machinery. The same applies to vibration. This is a particular problem with DMUs.

====Obsolescence====
Separating the motive power from the payload-carrying cars means that either can be replaced when obsolete without affecting the other.

==By country==
===Africa===

====Algeria====

Algeria possesses 17 units of the Coradia El Djazaïr, a multiple unit train produced by Alstom. These units are similar to the French version of Régiolis, which belongs to the Coradia family. 

==== South Africa ====

Metrorail, which provides commuter rail service in major urban areas of South Africa, operates most services using electric multiple unit train sets of the type 5M2A. These trains are being gradually refurbished and subsequently designated as 10M3 (Cape Town), 10M4 (Gauteng) or 10M5 (Durban). Metrorail services are split into four regions; Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Western Cape.

Gautrain, a commuter rail system in Johannesburg, operates with Bombardier Electrostar electric multiple units.

===East Asia===
====China====

The concept of multiple unit has entered the horizon of the Chinese since the 6th Speed-up Campaign of China Railway in 2007. With the upgrade of Jinghu Railway, North Jingguang Railway, Jingha Railway and Hukun Railway, and the construction of new Passenger Dedicated Lines (or Passenger Railways) completed, CRH (China Railway High-speed) trains have been put into service, mainly in North and Northeast China, and East China. All these CRH trains are electric multiple units. This was the beginning of the general service of multiple unit trains in China&#x27;s national railway system.

Far earlier than the introduction of CRH brand, multiple unit trains have been running on all major cities&#x27; metro lines in China.

====Japan====

In Japan almost all passenger trains, including the high-speed Shinkansen, are of the multiple-unit (MU) type, with most locomotives now used solely in freight operations. Of the locomotive-hauled passenger services still in operation, the majority are tourist-oriented, such as the numerous steam-hauled trains operated seasonally on scenic lines throughout the country, as well as some of the luxury cruise trains.

Japan is a country of high population density with a large number of railway passengers in relatively small urban areas, and frequent operation of short-distance trains has been required. Therefore, the high acceleration ability and quick turnaround times of MUs have advantages, encouraging their development in this country. Additionally, the mountainous terrain gives the MUs an advantage on grades steeper than those found in most countries, particularly on small private lines many of which run from coastal cities to small towns in the mountains.

Most long-distance trains in Japan were operated by locomotives until the 1950s, but by utilizing and enhancing the technology of short-distance urban MU trains, long-distance express MU-type vehicles were developed and widely introduced starting in the mid-1950s. This work resulted in the original Shinkansen development which optimized all of the EMU&#x27;s efficiencies to maximize speed. It was introduced upon completion of the Tokaido Shinkansen (literally &quot;new trunk line&quot;) in 1964. By the 1970s, locomotive traction was regarded as slow and inefficient, and its use is now mostly limited to freight trains.

From 1999, there have been development efforts in freight EMU technology, but it is currently used only for an express freight service on the Tokaido Main Line between Tokyo and Osaka. The government has been pushing for the adoption of freight EMU technology on energy efficiency grounds in the hope that widespread adoption could assist in meeting emissions targets. The effort has been principally targeted at express package shipping that would otherwise travel by road.

==== South Korea ====
In South Korea, the KTX-I and KTX-Sancheon, which are still centralized power trains, are the main trains, but the KTX-Eum, which opened in 2021, and the KTX-Cheongryong, which opened in 2024, are the multiple unit.
===Europe===
====Belgium====
The first EMUs have been introduced in Belgium in the 1930s. Several models have followed since then, such as the &quot;AM75&quot;.
====Ireland====
CIÉ introduced its first DMUs, the 2600-class, in 1951.

====Russia====

Elektrichka (, ) is an informal word for &quot;elektropoezd&quot; (), a Soviet or post-Soviet regional (mostly suburban) electrical multiple unit passenger train. Elektrichkas are widespread in Russia, Ukraine and some other countries of the former Soviet Union. The first &quot;elektrichka&quot; ride occurred in August 1929 between Moscow and Mytishchi.

==== Sweden ====
Swedish railroads have been privatized in steps for about 25 years, and today many different companies operate different types of multiple units. A majority of passenger trains today consists of multiple unit trains of which regional traffic exclusively use them.

==== Switzerland ====

The Swiss Federal Railways use many multiple units, mainly on regional lines (S-Bahn).

* Regional lines
** RBDe 560
** RABe 514
** RABe 520 &quot;Thurbo&quot;
** RABe 523 &quot;FLIRT&quot; and variants
** RABe 511 &quot;KISS&quot;
* Inter-City lines
** RABDe 500 &quot;ICN&quot;
*International lines
**ETR 610
**RABe 501

====United Kingdom====

In the UK the use of modern diesel multiple units was pioneered in Northern Ireland, although a number of other railway companies also experimented with early DMUs (including the Great Western and the London Midland Scottish). Notable examples include the Sprinter and Voyager families, and the newer Javelin trains.

The London Underground passenger system is operated exclusively by EMUs. Work trains on the Underground employ separate locomotives, some of which are dual battery/live rail powered.

In Northern Ireland the majority of passenger services have been operated by diesel multiple units since the mid-1950s under the tenure of both the Ulster Transport Authority (1948–1966) and Northern Ireland Railways (since 1967).

===Oceania===
====Australia====
The first multiple unis in Australia were the Tait trains, wooden bodied Electric Multiple Unit train that operated in Melbourne, Victoria. They were originally introduced as steam locomotive hauled carriages but were converted to electric traction from 1919 during Melbourne’s electrification project.

===South Asia===
====India====
Indian Railways has recently introduced a semi-high-speed EMU named Vande Bharat Express, capable of running at . And it continues to use diesel and electrical multiple units on its national network. All suburban and rapid transit lines are served by EMUs.

===Southeast Asia===
====Indonesia====
Indonesia uses diesel since 1976 and electric MUs since 1925. Most of these MUs were built in Japan.

====Philippines====
The Manila Railroad Company (MRR) acquired its first multiple units in the 1930s. The locally-built MC class was initially powered by gasoline and was changed to diesel during World War II. Both the MRR and its successor, the Philippine National Railways (PNR), has since acquired various classes of diesel multiple units. All multiple units owned by MRR and all of the older MUs of the PNR were built by Japanese firms. On the other hand, its newer rolling stock were built in South Korea and Indonesia. There will also be DMUs that will be built in China.

The first electric multiple units were acquired in 1984 for the LRT Line 1 built by La Brugeoise et Nivelles in Belgium. The first EMUs to be used outside of rapid transit will enter service between 2021 and 2022.

===North America===

Most trains in North America are locomotive-hauled and use Multiple Unit (MU) control to control multiple locomotives. The control system of the leading locomotive connects to the other locomotives so that the engineer&#x27;s control is repeated on all the additional locomotives. The locomotives are connected by multi-core cables. This does not make these locomotives MUs for the purposes of this article. See locomotive consist.

However, commuters, rapid transit, and light rail operations make extensive use of MUs. Most electrically powered trains are MUs.

The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) Regional Rail Division uses EMUs almost exclusively — the exception being some of its peak express service. New Jersey Transit service on the Northeast Corridor Line is split between electric locomotives and EMUs.

M2, M4, M6 and M8 EMUs which operate on the New Haven Line of Metro-North Railroad, are “multi-system” meaning they can draw power from either the third rail or from overhead lines. This allows operation under the wires between Pelham, NY and New Haven, CT, a section of track owned by Metro North but shared with Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor service, and on third rail between Pelham and Grand Central Terminal. EMUs are used on AMT&#x27;s Montreal/Deux-Montagnes line.

DMUs are less common, partly because new light rail operations are almost entirely electric, with many commuter routes already electrified, and also because of the difficulties posed by Federal Railway Administration rules limiting their use on shared passenger/freight corridors. When the Budd RDC was developed following World War II, it was adopted for many secondary passenger routes in the United States (especially on the Boston and Maine Railroad) and Canada. These operations generally survived longer in Canada, but several were abandoned in the Via Rail cutbacks of the early 1990s. One that survives is Victoria - Courtenay train on Vancouver Island. DMU use in Canada has been resurrected in recent years, beginning with the opening of Union Pearson Express in 2015.

While most DMUs need to comply with strict FRA crash requirements for simultaneous operation with freight railways, European-style DMUs are used with timesharing arrangements on several rail lines, including the RiverLINE in New Jersey. Only a handful of manufacturers in the United States produce or have produced FRA-compliant DMUs, including Colorado Railcar (now US Railcar) and Nippon Sharyo/Sumitomo Corporation. NJ Transit has experimented with this DMU on the Princeton Branch line. In August 2006 it was announced that Amtrak wants the State of Vermont to experiment with DMUs on the state-subsidized Vermonter line from New Haven north to St. Albans to replace the less efficient diesel locomotive trainsets currently used.

MU streetcars were used in Toronto by the Toronto Transportation Commission (later Toronto Transit Commission) from 1949 to 1966 using 100 PCC A-7 built by St. Louis Car Company and Canadian Car and Foundry. These two car units ran along the Bloor Street route only beginning in 1950 and ceased operations after the opening of the Bloor–Danforth subway line in 1966. The A-7 units were later converted to single use.

<doc id="97078" wikidata="Q611991" url="?curid=97078" title="Twister (game)">
<text>Twister is a game of physical skill produced by Milton Bradley Company and Winning Moves Games USA. It is played on a large plastic mat that is spread on the floor or ground. The mat has four rows of six large colored circles on it with a different color in each row: red, yellow, green and blue. A spinner tells players where they have to place their hand or foot. The game promotes itself as &quot;the game that ties you up in knots&quot;.

==Gameplay==
A spinner is attached to a square board and is used to determine where the player has to put their hand or foot. The spinner is divided into four labeled sections: left foot, right foot, left hand, and right hand. Each of those four sections are divided into the four colors (red, yellow, green, and blue). After spinning, the combination is called (for example: &quot;right hand yellow&quot;) and players must move their matching hand or foot to a circle of the correct color.

In a two-player game, no two people can have a hand or foot on the same circle; the rules are different for more players. Owing to the scarcity of colored circles, players will often be required to put themselves in unlikely or precarious positions, eventually causing someone to fall. A person is eliminated when they fall or when their elbow or knee touches the mat.

==History==
In 1964, Reyn Guyer Sr. owned and managed a design company which made in-store displays for Fortune 500 companies.

Charles Foley was a respected and successful toy designer for Lakeside Industries in Minneapolis and answered an ad for an experienced toy designer by Reynolds Guyer Sr. of Guyer Company. Foley interviewed with Reyn Guyer Sr. and his son, Reyn, who were interested in product development within the toy business. After interviewing Foley, Guyer and his son discussed the possibility of starting a small division of the company in product development. His father agreed, for a short term, to support his son&#x27;s idea for product development, and hired Foley, who negotiated a royalty agreement with Guyer Company for all games and toy items he designed. Guyer Company agreed, and officially hired Foley. Foley hired Neil Rabens, an accomplished product design artist with an art degree from the Minneapolis School of Art and Design.

The game ideas ranged from small kids&#x27; games to word games for adults. Foley had an idea for utilizing people as game pieces as part of the game idea, &quot;a party game&quot;. Rabens had the idea to utilize a colored mat, allowing people to interact with each other, in a game idea he had developed while a student in design school. Foley saw the idea and developed the concept for having the colored dots line up in rows, and, with a spinner, created the idea for calling out players&#x27; hands and feet to the colored dots called out from the spinner. This would create a tangled-up situation between two people, and the one that falls first would lose.

With the support of Reyn Guyer Sr., Charles Foley and Neil Rabens submitted, on 14 April 1966, and were granted on 8 July 1969, US Pat# 3,454,279, for what was originally called &quot;Pretzel&quot;. Foley, with his extensive experience in the toy industry, called on his good friend, Mel Taft, Sr. V.P. for Milton Bradley in 1966, for a product idea presentation. Milton Bradley embraced the idea for the &quot;Pretzel&quot; game but renamed the game &quot;Twister&quot;.

Twister became a major success when actress Eva Gabor played it with Johnny Carson on television&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on May 3, 1966. However, in its success, it was also controversial. The company that produced it, Milton Bradley, was accused by its competitors of selling &quot;sex in a box&quot;. That accusation is speculated to be because it was the first popular American game to use human bodies as playing pieces.

In 1966, &quot;Twister&quot; was licensed to Nintendo—then a toy and board game company—for the Japanese market, where it was released as &quot;Twister Game&quot;.

In 1984, Hasbro acquired the Milton Bradley Company, becoming Twister&#x27;s parent company. The Reyn Guyer Creative Group continues to work closely with Hasbro to develop and market new additions to the line of &quot;Twister&quot; products.

Co-inventor Charles Foley died on July 1, 2013, at the age of 82.

In 2023, Hasbro introduced Twister Air, an app-driven version of the game that uses motion-tracking wearables and augmented reality to track players&#x27; movements. The new version replaces the traditional mat with digital game play displayed through a connected device, like a cell phone.

===Phenomenon===
Twister, much like the hula hoop, was one of the many toy fad phenomena that came about in the second half of the 20th century. Microsoft Encarta labeled &quot;Twister&quot; as being an &quot;industry phenomenon&quot; that &quot;captures the public&#x27;s imagination, and sells in the millions&quot;. Being one of the earliest toy fads and a &quot;national craze for a short time&quot;, &quot;Twister&quot; was able to bring all age groups together, whether children or adults.

== Accessibility ==
There are publicly available instructions on how to alter a &quot;Twister&quot; game to make it accessible to color-blind individuals and to completely blind individuals.

&quot;Blindfolded Twister&quot; is an accessible variant where there are four different tactile symbols on the mat, and the players are blindfolded and have to find a circle with the named symbol by feeling.

==Reception==
In 1967, a year after its release, 3 million &quot;Twister&quot; games were sold.

&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Twister&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1980&quot;, praising it as being &quot;nearly as well known as Spin the Bottle, and ten times more enjoyable&quot; while noting that it is &quot;Best played on a soft surface with people you&#x27;d like to know better.&quot;

&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Twister&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1981&quot;, noting that &quot;To become a grandmaster at &quot;Twister&quot;, the first requirement is agility&quot; and that &quot;Like any good party game, &quot;Twister&quot; can be fun or it can be humiliating.&quot;

&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Twister&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1982&quot;, noting that players can &quot;Become a human pretzel in this popular party game for people who don&#x27;t mind getting better acquainted&quot; but cautioned to &quot;watch the person with the spinner—the temptation to cheat and call the most difficult move is usually irresistible&quot;.

<doc id="97079" wikidata="Q1547934" url="?curid=97079" title="Shango">
<text>Shango (Yoruba language: , also known as Changó or Xangô in Latin America; as Jakuta or Badé; and as Ṣangó in Trinidad Orisha) is an Orisha (or spirit) in Yoruba religion. Genealogically speaking, Shango is a royal ancestor of the Yoruba as he was the third Alaafin of the Oyo Kingdom prior to his posthumous deification. Shango has numerous manifestations, including Airá, Agodo, Afonja, Lubé, and Obomin. He is known for his powerful double axe (Oṣè). He is considered to be one of the most powerful rulers that Yorubaland has ever produced.

In the New World, he is syncretized with either Saint Barbara or Saint Jerome.

==Historical figure==
Ṣàngó was the third Alaafin of Oyo, following Oranmiyan and Ajaka. He brought prosperity to the Oyo Empire. According to Professor Mason&#x27;s &quot;Mythological Account of Heroes and Kings&quot;, unlike his peaceful brother Ajaka, he was a powerful and violent ruler. He reigned for seven years which were marked by his continuous campaigns and many battles. His reign ended due to the inadvertent destruction of his palace by lightning. He had three wives, namely Queen Oshun, Queen Oba, and Queen Oya.

Some of the slaves brought to the Americas were Yoruba, one of the various ethnic groups drawn into the Atlantic slave trade, and they brought the worship of Ṣàngó to the New World as a result. Strong devotion to Ṣàngó led to Yoruba religions in Trinidad and Recife, Brazil being named after the deity.

==Veneration of Ṣàngó==

=== Nigeria ===

Ṣàngó is viewed as the most powerful of the orisha pantheon and is often described in two differing narratives. In the first narrative, Ṣàngó casts a &quot;thunderstone&quot; to earth, which creates thunder and lightning, to anyone who offends him. Worshippers in Yorubaland in Nigeria do not eat cowpea because they believe that the wrath of the god of thunder and lightning would descend on them. In the second narrative, Ṣàngó is gifted with the ability to breathe fire and smoke through his nostrils and is known for being angered by his quarrelsome wives. These narratives also encapsulate the virility, bravery, and governance of Ṣàngó. While he was feared for tyranny and destructive powers, he was also highly revered for his bravery, fairness, and tremendous powers.

The Ṣàngó god necklaces are composed of varying patterns of red and white beads, usually in groupings of four or six, which are his sacred numbers. Rocks created by lightning strikes are venerated by Ṣàngó worshipers; these stones, if found, are maintained at sacred sites and used in rituals. Ṣàngó is called on during coronation ceremonies in Nigeria to the present day. 

In Yorubaland, Ṣàngó is worshipped on the fifth day of the week, which is named Ojo Jakuta. Ritual worship foods include guguru, bitter cola, àmàlà, and gbegiri soup. Also, he is worshipped with the Bata drum. One significant thing about this deity is that he is worshipped using red clothing, just as he is said to have admired red attire during his lifetime.

=== The Americas ===

Ṣàngó is venerated in Santería as &quot;Changó&quot;. As in the Yoruba religion, Changó is one of the most feared gods in Santería. 

In Haïti, he is from the &quot;Nago&quot; Nation, and is known as Ogou Chango. Palo recognizes him as &quot;Siete Rayos&quot;.

====Candomblé====

Ṣàngó is known as Xangô in the Candomblé pantheon. He is said to be the son of Oranyan, and his wives include Oya, Oshun, and Oba, as in the Yoruba tradition. Xangô took on strong importance among slaves in Brazil for his qualities of strength, resistance, and aggression. He is noted as the god of lightning and thunder. He became the patron orixa of plantations and many Candomblé terreiros. In contrast Oko, the orixá of agriculture, found little favor among slaves in Brazil and has few followers in the Americas. The main barracão of Ilê Axé Iyá Nassô Oká, or the terreiro Casa Branca, is dedicated to Xangô. Xangô is depicted with an &quot;oxê&quot;, or double-sided ax similar to a labrys; and a brass crown.

====Characteristics====

*Consecrated day: Friday 
*Colors: white and red
*Elements: thunder, lightning, fire
*Sacred food: amalá (a swallow food made of yam, cassava flour, or unripe plantain flour called èlùbọ́)
*Instruments: oxê, a double ax; bangles; brass crown; Thunder Stones, or objects struck by lightning 
*Garment: red cloth with printed white squares or cowrie shells
*Necklace or Elekes: white and red beads
*Archetype: power, dominance
*Sacred dance: &quot;alujá&quot;, the &quot;roda de Xangô&quot;. It speaks of his achievements, deeds, consorts, power, and dominion 
*Sacrificial animals: fresh water turtle, male goat, sheep

Amalá, also known as &quot;amalá de Xangô&quot;, is the ritual dish offered to the orixá. It is a stew made of chopped okra, onion, dried shrimp, and palm oil. Amalá is served on Wednesday at the &quot;pegi&quot;, or altar, on a large tray, traditionally decorated with 12 upright uncooked okra. Due to ritual prohibitions, the dish may not be offered on a wooden tray or accompanied by bitter kola. Amalá de Xangô may also be prepared with the addition of beef, specifically an ox tail. Amalá de Xangô is different than àmàlà, a dish common to Yoruba areas of Nigeria.

<doc id="97080" wikidata="Q192417" url="?curid=97080" title="Callimachus">
<text>Callimachus (; ) was an ancient Greek poet, scholar, and librarian who was active in Alexandria during the 3rd century BC. A representative of Ancient Greek literature of the Hellenistic period, he wrote over 800 literary works, most of which do not survive, in a wide variety of genres. He espoused an aesthetic philosophy, known as Callimacheanism, which exerted a strong influence on the poets of the Roman Empire and, through them, on all subsequent Western literature.

Born into a prominent family in the Greek city of Cyrene in modern-day Libya, he was educated in Alexandria, the capital of the Ptolemaic kings of Egypt. After working as a schoolteacher in the city, he came under the patronage of King Ptolemy II Philadelphus and was employed at the Library of Alexandria where he compiled the &quot;Pinakes&quot;, a comprehensive catalogue of all Greek literature. He is believed to have lived into the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes.

Although Callimachus wrote prolifically in prose and poetry, only a small number of his poetical texts have been preserved. His main works are the &quot;Aetia&quot;, a four-book aetiological poem, six religious hymns, around 60 epigrams, a collection of satirical iambs, and a narrative poem entitled &quot;Hecale&quot;. Callimachus shared many characteristics with his Alexandrian contemporaries Aratus, Apollonius of Rhodes and Theocritus, but professed to adhere to a unique style of poetry: favouring small, recondite and even obscure topics, he dedicated himself to small-scale poetry and refused to write longwinded epic poetry, the most prominent literary art of his day.

Callimachus and his aesthetic philosophy became an important point of reference for Roman poets of the late Republic and the early Empire. Catullus, Horace, Vergil, Propertius, and Ovid saw his poetry as one of their &quot;principal model[s]&quot; and engaged with it in a variety of ways. Modern classical scholars view him as one of the most influential Greek poets. According to the Hellenist Kathryn Gutzwiller, he &quot;reinvented Greek poetry for the Hellenistic age by devising a personal style that came, through its manifestations in Roman poetry, to influence the entire tradition of modern literature&quot;.

==Life==

An entry in the &quot;Suda&quot;, a 10th-century Byzantine encyclopaedia, is the main source about the life of Callimachus. Although the entry contains factual inaccuracies, it enables the re-construction of his biography by providing some otherwise unattested information. Callimachus was born into a prominent family in Cyrene, a Greek city on the coast of modern-day Libya. He refers to himself as &quot;son of Battus&quot; (), but this may be an allusion to the city&#x27;s mythological founder Battus rather than to his father. His grandfather, also named Callimachus, had served the city as a general. His mother&#x27;s name was Megatima, falsely given as Mesatma by the &quot;Suda&quot;. His unknown date of birth is placed around 310 BC.

During the 280s, Callimachus is thought to have studied under the philosopher Praxiphanes and the grammarian Hermocrates at Alexandria, an important centre of Greek culture. He appears to have experienced a period of relative poverty while working as a schoolteacher in the suburbs of the city. The truthfulness of this claim is disputed by the classicist Alan Cameron who describes it as &quot;almost certainly outright fiction&quot;. Callimachus then entered into the patronage of the Ptolemies, the Greek ruling dynasty of Egypt, and was employed at the Library of Alexandria. According to the &quot;Suda&quot;, his career coincided with the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who became sole ruler of Egypt in 283 BC. Classicist John Ferguson puts the latest date of Callimachus&#x27;s establishment at the imperial court at 270 BC.

Despite the lack of precise sources, the outlines of Callimachus&#x27;s working life can be gathered from his poetry. Poems belonging to his period of economic hardship indicate that he began writing in the 280s BC, while his poem &quot;Aetia&quot; shows signs of having been composed in the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes, who ascended to the throne in 246 BC. Contemporary references suggest that Callimachus was writing until about 240 BC, and Ferguson finds it likely that he died by 235 BC, at which time he would have been 75 years old.

==Literary work==
According to the &quot;Suda&quot;, Callimachus wrote more than 800 individual works in prose and poetry. The vast majority of his literary production, including all prose output, has been lost with the exception of his &quot;Epigrams&quot; and &quot;Hymns&quot;. All other works mentioned below have been preserved in fragments. Callimachus was an admirer of Homer, whom he regarded as impossible to imitate. This could be the reason why he focused on short poems.

===&quot;Epigrams&quot;===
Epigrams, brief, forceful poems originally written on stone and on votive offerings, were already established as a form of literature by the 3rd century BC. Callimachus wrote at least 60 individual epigrams on a wide range of topics. While some of them are dedicatory or sepulchral, others touch on erotic and purely literary themes. Most of them were transmitted in the &quot;Palatine Anthology&quot;, a 10th-century manuscript discovered in 1606 at Heidelberg containing a collection of Greek epigrams and poems. Often written from a first-person perspective, the &quot;Epigrams&quot; offer a great variety of styles and draw on different branches of the epigrammatic tradition. According to the Callimachus scholar Benjamin Acosta-Hughes, &quot;[t]heir intelligent play on language, meter, and word placement&quot; have placed the poems among the most prominent works of the Hellenistic period.

===&quot;Hymns&quot;===

Among the oldest forms of religious writing, hymns were &quot;formal addresses to a god or group of gods on behalf of a community&quot;. Cultic hymns were written and performed in honour of a particular god; examples of this genre can be found in most Greek lyric poets. A typical hymn would contain an invocation of the god, praise of his or her attributes, and a concluding prayer with a request for a favour. Callimachus wrote six such hymns, which can be divided into two groups: his &quot;Hymn to Apollo&quot;, &quot;to Demeter&quot; and &quot;to Athena&quot; are considered mimetic because they present themselves as live re-enactments of a religious ritual in which both the speaker and the audience are imagined to take part. The &quot;Hymn to Zeus&quot;, &quot;to Demeter&quot;, and &quot;to Delos&quot; are viewed as non-mimetic since they do not re-create a ritual situation.

It is contested among scholars of ancient literature whether Callimachus&#x27;s hymns had any real religious significance. The dominant view holds that they were literary creations to be read exclusively as poetry, though some scholars have linked individual elements to contemporary ritual practice. This issue is further complicated by Callimachus&#x27;s purposeful amalgamation of fiction and potential real-world performance.

===&quot;Aetia&quot;===

The Greek word (, &#x27;cause&#x27;) means an attempt to explain contemporary phenomena with a story from the mythical past. The title of Callimachus&#x27;s work can be roughly translated into English as &quot;origins&quot;. The &quot;Aetia&quot; contains a collection of origin stories. Ranging in size from a few lines to extensive narratives, they are unified by a common metre—the elegiac couplet. With few exceptions, the collection is the earliest extant source for most of the myths it presents. Throughout the work, the poet&#x27;s voice repeatedly intrudes into his narratives to offer comments on the dramatic situation. This pattern is described by the Hellenist Kathryn Gutzwiller as one of the poem&#x27;s most influential features.

The poem is thought to have had about 4,000 lines and is organised into four individual books, which are divided in halves on stylistic grounds. In the first book, Callimachus describes a dream in which, as a young man, he was transported by the Muses to Mount Helicon in Boeotia. The young poet interrogates the goddesses about the origins of unusual present day customs. This dialogue frames all aetiologies presented in the first book. The stories in the book include those of Linus and Coroebus, Theiodamas, king of the Dryopes and the voyage of the Argonauts. The second book continues the first&#x27;s dialectic structure. It may have been set at a symposium at Alexandria, where Callimachus worked as a librarian and scholar. Since most of its content has been lost, little is known about Book 2. The only aetiology commonly assumed to have been placed in the book are the stories Busiris, king of Egypt, and Phalaris, the tyrant of Akragas, who were known for their excessive cruelty.

The second half of the &quot;Aetia&quot; does not follow the pattern established in Books 1 and 2. Instead, individual aetiologies are set in a variety of dramatic situations and do not form a contiguous narrative. The books are framed by two well known narratives: Book 3 opens with the &quot;Victory of Berenice&quot;. Composed in the style of a Pindaric Ode, the self-contained poem celebrates queen Berenice&#x27;s victory in the Nemean Games. Enveloped within the epinician narrative is an aetiology of the games themselves. The end of Book 4 and the &quot;Aetia&quot; as a whole is marked by another court poem, the &quot;Lock of Berenice&quot;. In it, Callimachus relates how the queen gave a lock of her hair as a votive offering which later became a constellation, the Coma Berenices (&quot;Hair of Berenice&quot;).
Another notable story from the second half of the work is the love story of Acontius and Cydippe.

===&quot;Iambs&quot;===
At the close of his &quot;Aetia&quot;, Callimachus wrote that he would proceed to a more pedestrian field of poetry. By this, he referred to his collection of 13 &quot;Iambs&quot;, drawing on an established tradition of iambic poetry whose defining feature was their aggressive, satirical tone. Although the poems are poorly preserved, their content is known from a set of ancient summaries (&quot;diegeseis&quot;). In the &quot;Iambs&quot;, Callimachus critically comments on issues of interest, revolving mostly around aesthetics and personal relationships. He uses the polemical tone of the genre to defend himself against critics of his poetic style and his tendency to write in a variety of genres. This is made explicit in the final poem of the collection, where the poet compares himself to a carpenter who is praised for crafting many different objects.

The &quot;Iambs&quot; are notable for their vivid language. Callimachus couches his aesthetic criticism in vivid imagery taken from the natural and social world: rival scholars are compared to wasps swarming from the ground and to flies resting on a goatherd. He often mixes different metaphors to create effects of &quot;wit and incongruity&quot;, such as when a laurel tree is described as &quot;glaring like a wild bull&quot;. Ferguson also notes the poems&#x27; witty use of proverbs in dialectic passages of dialogue.

===&quot;Hecale&quot;===

Callimachus made only one attempt at writing a narrative poem, a mythological epic entitled &quot;Hecale&quot;. Since the poem is estimated to run to have had around 1000 lines, it constitutes an epyllion, a shorter form of epic poetry dealing with topics not traditionally present in larger-scale works. It recounts a story about the Greek hero Theseus, who, after liberating the city of Marathon from a destructive bull, was hosted by a poor but kindly old woman named Hecale. They form a friendship as she recounts her former life as a member of the upper class. At the end of the poem, Theseus establishes an annual feast and a sanctuary to Zeus in honour of his host.

Since most of Callimachus&#x27;s poetry is critical of epic as a genre, there has been some speculation about why he chose to write an epic poem after all. The author of a scholium, an ancient commentary on the work of Callimachus, stated that Callimachus abandoned his reluctance after being ridiculed for not writing lengthy poems. This explanation was probably derived from the poet&#x27;s own intimation at the start of the &quot;Aetia&quot; and is therefore of limited authority. According to Cameron, Callimachus may have conceived the &quot;Hecale&quot; as a model epic according to his own tastes.

==&quot;Pinakes&quot;==
When working at the Library of Alexandria, Callimachus was responsible for the library&#x27;s cataloguing. In this function, he compiled a detailed bibliography of all existing Greek literature deriving from the library&#x27;s shelf-lists. His catalogue, named &quot;Pinakes&quot; after the plural of the Greek for &#x27;tablet&#x27; (), amounted to 120 volumes or five times the length of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;. Although the &quot;Pinakes&quot; have not survived the end of antiquity, scholars have reconstructed their content from references in surviving classical literature. Authors and their works were divided into the broad categories of &#x27;poetry&#x27; and &#x27;prose&#x27;. Both categories were further broken down into precise subcategories. For poets, these included, among others, &#x27;drama&#x27;, &#x27;epic&#x27;, and &#x27;lyric&#x27;; for prose writers, &#x27;philosophy&#x27;, &#x27;oratory&#x27;, &#x27;history&#x27;, and &#x27;medicine&#x27;. Entries were sorted alphabetically, giving an author&#x27;s biography and a list of his works. According to the classicist Lionel Casson, the &quot;Pinakes&quot; were the first comprehensive bibliographic resource for Greek literature and a &quot;vital reference tool&quot; for using the Alexandrian Library.

==Callimacheanism==
In his poetry, Callimachus espoused an aesthetic philosophy that has become known as Callimacheanism. He favoured small-scale topics over large and prominent ones, and refinement over long works of poetry. At the beginning of the &quot;Aetia&quot;, he summarised his poetic programme in an allegory spoken by the god Apollo: &quot;my good poet, feed my victim as fat as possible, but keep your Muse slender. This, too, I order from you: tread the way that wagons do not trample. Do not drive in the same tracks as others or on a wide road but on an untrodden path, even if yours is more narrow.&quot; The allegory is directed against the predominant poetic form of the day: heroic epic, which could run to dozens of books in length. Contained in the allegory are two reasons why Callimachus did not write in this genre: firstly, to Callimachus, poetry required a high level of refinement which could not be sustained over the course of a drawn-out work; secondly, most of his contemporaries were writers of epic, creating an over-saturation of the genre which he sought to avoid. Instead, he was interested in recondite, experimental, learned and even obscure topics. His poetry nevertheless surpasses epic in its allusions to previous literature.

Although Callimachus attempted to differentiate himself from other poets, his aesthetic philosophy is sometimes subsumed under the term of Alexandrianism, describing the entirety of Greek literature written in Alexandria during the 3rd century BC. In spite of their differences, his work shares many characteristics with that of his contemporaries including the didactic poet Aratus, the epicist Apollonius of Rhodes, and the pastoral poet Theocritus. They all interacted with earlier Greek literature, especially the poems of Homer and Hesiod. Drawing on the Library of Alexandria, they all displayed an interest in intellectual pursuits, and they all attempted to revive neglected forms of poetry.

Callimachus used both direct and indirect characterization in his works. The use of comparisons and similes is rather sparse. The use of intertextuality is observed in &quot;Hymn 6&quot;, where descriptions of other characters are offered in order to provide contrast to the characterization of the main character. Frequent allusions to the &quot;Odyssey&quot; and the &quot;Iliad&quot; appear, for example reference to Antilochus in &quot;Hymn 6.&quot; Some Homeric influences can be seen through the use of Homeric hapaxes, such as katōmadian.

==Reception==
===Ancient===

Callimachus and his aesthetic philosophy became an important point of reference for Roman poets of the late Republic and the early Empire. Catullus, Horace, Vergil, Propertius, and Ovid saw his poetry as one of their &quot;principal model[s]&quot;. Due to the complexity of his poetic production, Roman authors did not attempt to reproduce Callimachus&#x27;s poems but creatively reused them in their own work. Vergil, in his &quot;Aeneid&quot;, an epic about the wanderings of Aeneas, repeatedly alludes to Callimachus when contemplating the nature of his own poetry. Having followed Callimachus&#x27;s example by rejecting traditional epic poetics in his 6th Eclogue, Vergil labels his &quot;Aeneid&quot; as a &quot;better work&quot; (). Vergil&#x27;s formulation leaves open whether he sought to write an epic with the refinement called for by Callimachus or whether he had turned his back on Callimacheanism as his career progressed.

Having referred to himself as a &quot;Roman Callimachus&quot; (), the elegist Propertius follows the example of Callimachus&#x27;s &quot;Aetia&quot; by introducing obscure mythological material and numerous recondite details into his erotic history of Rome. At the same time, he challenges Callimachean learnedness by depicting lowbrow details of contemporary nightlife such as strippers and dwarfs kept for entertainment purposes. Ovid described Callimachus as &quot;lacking in genius but strong in art&quot; (). His statement, though seemingly a criticism of the poet, pays homage to Callimachus&#x27;s belief that technical skill and erudition were the most important attributes of a poet.

===Modern===
Classical scholars place Callimachus among the most influential Greek poets. According to Kathryn Gutzwiller, he &quot;reinvented Greek poetry for the Hellenistic age by devising a personal style that came, through its manifestations in Roman poetry, to influence the entire tradition of modern literature&quot;. She also writes that his lasting importance is demonstrated by the strong reactions his poetry elicited from contemporaries and posterity. Richard L. Hunter, an expert on Greek literature of the Hellenistic period, states that the selective reception of Callimachus through Roman poets has led to a simplified picture of his poetry. Hunter writes that modern critics have drawn up a false dichotomy between the &quot;content-laden and socially engaged poetry of the archaic and classical periods&quot; and a sophisticated, but meaningless style proposed by Callimachus. Echoing Hunter&#x27;s assessment in their 2012 book on the reception of Callimachus, the Hellenists Benjamin Acosta-Hughes and Susan Stephens comment that the scarcity of primary evidence and the reliance on Roman accounts has created a label of Callimacheanism that does not accurately represent his literary work.

<text>A flight surgeon is a military medical officer practicing in the clinical field of aviation medicine, which is also occasionally known as flight surgery.

Flight surgeons are medical doctors who serve as the primary care physicians for a variety of military aviation personnel, including pilots, Flight Officers, navigators, astronauts, missile combat crews, air traffic controllers, UAV operators and other aircrew members, both officer and enlisted.

Aviation medicine is essentially a form of occupational medicine, and flight surgeons are tasked with the responsibility of maintaining medical standards, especially those that apply to those on flying, controlling or airborne status. In some jurisdictions, such as the U.S military, flight surgeons are trained to fill general public health and occupational and preventive medicine roles, and only infrequently perform surgery in an operating theater sense. Flight surgeons are not required to be rated or licensed pilots. They may be called upon to provide medical consultation as members of an investigation board into a military or aviation or spaceflight mishap. Occasionally, they may serve to provide in-flight care to patients being evacuated via aeromedical evacuation.

The civilian equivalent of the flight surgeon is the Aviation Medical Examiner (AME). Some civilian AMEs have training similar to that of military flight surgeons, and some are retired military and reservist flight surgeons.

==History==
The roots of aviation medicine extend back to the earliest scientific discoveries of gas laws and the makeup of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere as these factors relate to the human body. As aviation progressed from lighter-than-air balloons to fixed wing controlled flight to spaceflight, the disciplines of medicine and physiology were required to track with each technological advance. Physicians and physiologists, such as John Jeffries (1745–1819) and Paul Bert (1833–1886), conducted experiments on humans in flight and documented the body&#x27;s response to these physiologic stressors. However, it would not be until airplanes were first used in war that the office of the first flight surgeon was established.

===World War I===
The term &quot;flight surgeon&quot; originated in the early months of 1918 when the U.S. Air Medical Service of the U.S. Army collaborated with two civilian aviation organizations—the Aero Club of America and the Aerial League of America—to manage problems of medical screening and standards for U.S. military aviators.

The term is especially associated with Colonel (later Brigadier General) Theodore C. Lyster (the first Chief Surgeon, Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps, U.S. Army), and with Major Isaac H. Jones. These two officers proposed the organization of a pioneering &quot;Care of the Flier&quot; unit in June 1918.

The original intent was for the military and the Surgeon General to understand what was causing the high flight mishap rate. Shortly after the appointment of the first flight surgeons, research and experience led to a dramatic improvement in aircrew health as well as a significant raising of the entry medical standards for all aircrew. The early flight surgeons found that the Army&#x27;s practice of assigning officers to flight duty who were not physically qualified for infantry or cavalry duty was improper. Because of the G-forces, risk of spatial disorientation, and risk of hypoxia encountered in the aviation environment, among other challenges, early flight surgeons found that aviation personnel must be scrupulously healthy and well trained in the basics of aerospace physiology.

===World War II===
The role of flight surgeons continued to mature and expand as the U.S. faced World War II. The 1941 movie &quot;Dive Bomber&quot;, although focused on Naval Aviation, highlighted the role of the flight surgeon just prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, and demonstrated how solving the problems of hypoxia at altitude would reduce the aircraft mishap rate.

During World War II, the head of the U.S. Army Air Forces, General of the Army (later General of the Air Force) Henry &#x27;Hap&#x27; Arnold, directed all flight surgeons in the Army Air Forces to fly regularly with their patients in order to better understand the aviation environment. Consequently, to this day, their successor U.S. Air Force Flight Surgeons are considered &quot;aeronautically rated&quot; aircrew members who receive flight pay and who are required to fly a certain number of hours monthly. The same policy applies to Army Flight Surgeons and to Naval Flight Surgeons, the latter who are considered &quot;aeronautically designated&quot; officers like their Naval Aviator and Naval Flight Officer counterparts.

Strict racial segregation in the U.S. Army required the development of separate black flight surgeons to support the operations and training of the Tuskegee Airmen in 1941 and continued in the U.S. Army Air Forces throughout World War II. Following the establishment of an independent U.S. Air Force and the racial integration of all the U.S. armed forces following World War II, this separation was discontinued.

===Cold War===
Flight Surgeons were still utilized but only in garrison environments.

During the Vietnam War, USAF flight surgeons were utilized on flights.

===Today===
==Training==
The position of flight surgeon requires additional specialized training beyond traditional medical school; training which is both military and medical in nature. Flight Surgeon training was created as distinct from other medical professionals in the armed forces because of the special, and often higher, minimum standards of fitness and physical requirements required by the extremely high responsibility positions of aviators and ancillary aviation personnel. For example, some routine treatments, such as certain antihistamines, when administered to aviation personnel, are cause for temporary grounding (loss of flying privileges) until the therapy and its effects are completed. Further, the whole &quot;mindset&quot; of aviation medicine practitioners is different from that of non-aviation physicians. Most medical problems on the ground are &quot;an abnormal response to a normal environment&quot;, while in aviation the clinician must consider the &quot;normal response to an abnormal environment.&quot;

Flight surgeon training varies depending on the branch of military service:

===U.S. Air Force===

In the U.S. Air Force, most flight surgeons receive initial training at the U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. The entry curriculum is known as the Aerospace Medicine Primary (AMP) Course, a two-week curriculum that involves aeromedical topics as well as aircrew and survival training. AMP is a combination of didactic and laboratory experiences designed to prepare USAF medical officers for basic mission qualification to perform duties in support of the objectives of the USAF Aerospace Medicine Program.

Some Air Force Flight Surgeons ultimately move on to the Residency in Aerospace Medicine (RAM), a three-year program involving a Master of Public Health, a year of aerospace medical training, and a year of either occupational or preventive medical training. Graduates of the RAM are eligible to be double-boarded in Aerospace Medicine and either Occupational or Preventive Medicine, and are generally assigned to supervise other flight surgeons or medical units. The RAM also involves Medical Officer Flight Familiarization Training (MOFFT), during which the flight surgeon receives abbreviated ground school and some basic pilot training in the T-6 Texan II. Consequently, a RAM has some actual piloting experience and some training toward initial qualification, although the aeronautical rating of USAF Pilot is not awarded.

A limited number of USAF Flight Surgeons may also perform duties as Pilot-Physicians (Air Force Specialty Code 48VX). Pilot-Physicians initially begin their USAF service as line officer pilots, later transferring to the USAF medical corps in order to attend medical school. The purpose of pilot-physicians is to provide &quot;integrated operational and aerospace medicine guidance&quot; in the research, development, testing, and evaluation of Air Force systems and missions to realize the greatest effectiveness and cost savings.
Pilot-physicians were previously assigned only to an operational flying squadron in their respective aircraft, with their main assignment as a pilot, but also with clinical duties seeing patients, usually the aviation medicine clinic, depending on the pilot-physician&#x27;s medical specialty. On 21 April 2011 the USAF Pilot-Physician Program (PPP) was completely revised to make &quot;... the most of the special resources of Air Force officers who are simultaneously qualified both as pilots and flight surgeons...&quot;, with a senior pilot-physician selected by the Air Force Surgeon General to be Program Director, and assignment of designated command, staff, research, training, and education billets as well as duty in operational units. A P48VX Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) is assigned to those medical officers on aeronautical orders as a pilot-physician and assigned to one of these designated PPP billets. Pilot-Physicians are entitled to conditional flight pay (i.e., Aviation Career Incentive Pay or ACIP), that is, only if assigned to an active flying position and flying a prescribed number of hours monthly.
In addition to being a rated pilot and a rated flight surgeon, a pilot-physician must have completed at least three years of operational flying and one year as an operational flight surgeon, with a provision for assigning applicants without flight surgeon operational experience to a base where they would likely become a &quot;first assignment pilot-physician&quot;. The revised program allows flight surgeons access to undergraduate pilot training and remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) pilot training (one slot per year); allows participation of flight surgeons with prior experience as USAF Combat Systems Officers/Navigators/Electronic Warfare Officers/Weapons Systems Officers, RPA sensor operators, and flight test engineers as navigator-physicians or flight test-physicians; and authorizes pilot-physicians to compete for assignment to the USAF Test Pilot School.
Pilot-physicians are defined by four core competencies to achieve program objectives:
(1) Providing expert guidance through the synthesis of operational and medical experience; (2) Conducting research by applying operational insights to studies, basic and applied science, relevant research, development, test &amp; evaluation (RDT&amp;E), and operational test &amp; evaluation (OT&amp;E); (3) Teaching aircrew, senior Air Force leaders, and medical personnel on subjects of particular expertise, and (4) Conducting analysis to provide recommendations for operational systems, environments, and mishaps; and solutions to human performance problems.
Pilot-physicians are eligible for advanced ratings as both flight surgeons and pilots. They may apply toward advanced pilot ratings any USAF pilot years of aviation service, months of operational flying duty, and total flying hours accrued before achieving flight surgeon status. After attaining status as a pilot-physician, all hours flown as a pilot, and months of operational flying duty credit accrued as a pilot, are &quot;dual-credited&quot; toward both advanced pilot and flight surgeon ratings as long as the officer is on aeronautical orders as an active pilot-physician.

USAF Flight Surgeons hold three different rating levels, Flight Surgeon, Senior Flight Surgeon and Chief Flight Surgeon, contingent upon years of service as a flight surgeon and total flight hours logged. Air Force Flight Surgeons serve throughout the flying activities of the U.S. Air Force, to include flight surgeons in the Air Reserve Component who serve in the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and the Air National Guard (ANG).

===U.S. Navy===

In the U.S. Navy, initial flight surgeon training is conducted via the Flight Surgeon Primary Course at the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute (NAMI) at NAS Pensacola, Florida. The Flight Surgeon Primary Course is significantly longer than its USAF counterpart and involves a lengthier and more robust version of MOFFT for &quot;all&quot; candidates, so that &quot;all&quot; Navy flight surgeons have some formal pilot training in the T-6 Texan II aircraft, up to the &quot;safe for solo&quot; point in training as well as 5 flights in the Navy TH-57 training helicopter. Naval Flight Surgeons may also attend a three-year RAM training program that is distinct from the USAF program. Following training, nearly all Naval Flight Surgeons will be assigned to a deployable Navy or Marine Corps combat aviation squadron in the Fleet (USN) or Fleet Marine Force (USMC). More senior flight surgeons will later be assigned to the staff of a Naval Air Force or Marine Aircraft Wing, carrier air wings, functional/type air wings, Marine Aircraft Groups, the Medical Departments of aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships, or the staff of Naval Hospitals or Naval Branch Clinics aboard Naval Air Stations, Marine Corps Air Stations and Naval Air Facilities. Naval Flight Surgeons are also eligible command Naval Hospitals, Naval Branch Clinics and the Medical contingent aboard naval hospital ships.

A small number of Naval Flight Surgeons are also &quot;dual-designated&quot; as Naval Aviators or Naval Flight Officers, having either been former unrestricted line officer pilots or NFOs who transferred to the Navy&#x27;s Medical Corps, attended medical schools, and later qualified as Naval Flight Surgeons; or previously designated Naval Flight Surgeons were selected for a full flight training as Student Naval Aviators. These latter officers are also awarded Naval Aviator insignia, but remain in the Medical Corps as &quot;dual designated&quot; officers, qualified as either a Naval Aviator or Naval Flight Officer and as a Naval Flight Surgeon whom wear both insignia. Such officers are often assigned as research pilots.

A small number of Naval Flight Surgeons—including two dual-designated Naval Aviators/Naval Flight Surgeons: CAPT David M. Brown, MC, USN (FS) and CAPT Joseph P. Kerwin, MC, USN (FS) -- have also qualified as astronauts. CAPT Kerwin flew in 1973 as Science Pilot aboard Skylab 1, becoming the first U.S. physician to fly in space. Two of these officers, CAPT Brown and CAPT Laurel Blair Salton Clark, MC, USN (FS) were both killed during the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, mission STS-107, in 2003.

Naval Flight Surgeons provide support to aviation units and personnel of both the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps, to include aviation units and personnel of the Navy Reserve and the Marine Corps Reserve.

===U.S. Army===

Since the separation of the U.S. Army Air Force from the Army as the U.S. Air Force in 1947, Army flight surgeons have primarily focused on the health and fitness of the Army&#x27;s rotary wing aviators. Most Army flight surgeons graduate from a basic course of 6 weeks taught at the U.S. Army School of Aviation Medicine at Fort Novosel, Alabama, and are then assigned to their units. After some experience in the field, Army flight surgeons are then eligible to participate in a RAM program as described above. In the past, most Army RAMs have participated in the USAF program, but many take part in the USN program, while a few study in the only US civilian RAM program, located at Wright State University. RAM training is the equivalent of other specialty residency training in the United States, and a graduate of the program can take board certification tests and is then considered a fully-fledged specialist. Like their USAF counterparts, Army flight surgeons also hold three different rating levels, Flight Surgeon, Senior Flight Surgeon and Master Flight Surgeon, contingent upon years of service as a flight surgeon and total flight hours logged. Army flight surgeons support all active duty Army Aviation units and personnel, as well as those in the Army Reserve and Army National Guard.

===Other countries===
The training requirements for military flight surgeons in countries other than the United States are different—for example, in the United Kingdom, Aviation Medicine is considered a sub-specialty of Occupational Medicine rather than a fully separate specialty. Thus, Royal Air Force, Royal Navy and British Army specialists in Aviation Medicine are usually required to be specialists in Occupational Medicine before undertaking the specialised training in Aviation Medicine.

<text>Signals is the ninth studio album by Canadian rock band Rush, released on September 9, 1982 by Anthem Records. After the release of their previous album, &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, the band started to prepare material for a follow-up during soundchecks on their 1981 concert tour and during the mixing of their subsequent live album &quot;Exit...Stage Left&quot;. &quot;Signals&quot; demonstrates the group&#x27;s continuing use of synthesizers, sequencers, and other electronic instrumentation. It is the last album produced by their longtime associate Terry Brown, who had worked with them since 1974.

The album peaked at No. 1 in Canada, No. 3 in the United Kingdom, and No. 10 in the United States. In November 1982, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling one million copies in the United States. Rush released three singles from the album: &quot;New World Man&quot;, which became the band&#x27;s highest charting single in the United States and a number-one hit in Canada, as well as &quot;Subdivisions&quot; and &quot;Countdown&quot;. The group supported &quot;Signals&quot; with a concert tour from April 1982 to May 1983. &quot;Signals&quot; has been reissued several times, including a remaster with a new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mix in 2011.

== Background and recording ==
In July 1981, Rush ended their tour in support of their previous album &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;. The album became their most commercially successful of their history, granting them their first No. 1 album in Canada and selling over one million copies in the United States at the tour&#x27;s conclusion. Rush then took a three-month break, during which they oversaw the production and mixing of their second live release, &quot;Exit...Stage Left&quot;, at Le Studio in Morin-Heights, Quebec. In one of drummer and lyricist Neil Peart&#x27;s diary entries written during this time, he had been cleaning a Hayman drum kit that was housed in the studio and, in September 1981, began working out a song with two members of the band&#x27;s road crew, the unreleased &quot;Tough Break&quot;. Peart was also working on lyrics, in particular a set which included &quot;Subdivisions&quot;, a track the group would later record for &quot;Signals&quot;.

Having arranged some material for their next studio album, Rush toured North America and Europe from October to December 1981 with a setlist that contained &quot;Subdivisions&quot;. The group had their sound man capture their soundchecks on tape which provided a method of developing new songs, which was particularly the case for &quot;Chemistry&quot;. The majority of &quot;Signals&quot; was written and rehearsed in early 1982. Geddy Lee has said that the group were aware of how easy it would have been to &quot;play it safe&quot; and produce another &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, a mindset the band was entirely against. The album displays the band continuing to incorporate the synthesizer into their songs with less emphasis on guitar-oriented riffs which had been the focus of their sound in the 1970s. Lee considered &quot;Signals&quot; as the beginning of a new era for the band. In hindsight, he said it was considerably difficult to make because it took longer than usual for the band to achieve the right feel for each song. Some ideas that Alex Lifeson and Lee had initially saved for potential solo albums were used on &quot;Signals&quot;. Writer and journalist Greg Quill noticed a &quot;cyclical framework&quot; in &quot;Signals&quot;, specifically the album opening in suburbia followed by contemplating escape in &quot;The Analog Kid&quot;. Then, &quot;universal human imponderables&quot; are explored through humanity, sex, religion, and aging, which ends in an actual escape in &quot;Countdown&quot;. Quill spoke to Peart about this theory, to which the drummer replied: &quot;You noticed that. We were hoping no one would. It&#x27;s so unfashionable these days to construct grand concepts. We&#x27;re being closed mouthed about it&quot;.

Recording began at Le Studio in April 1982, and ended on July 15. It is Rush&#x27;s last album co-produced by their longtime associate Terry Brown, who had worked with them since 1974. He was joined by engineer Paul Northfield with assistance from Robbie Whelan. Rush intended to finish the album in June, but had to spend additional time in the studio which led to a month&#x27;s reduction in their planned vacation time. Upon completion, the album was mastered by Bob Ludwig at Masterdisk.

==Songs==
===Side one===
&quot;Subdivisions&quot; was one of the first songs Rush had arranged for &quot;Signals&quot;. After Peart devised a set of lyrics, Lifeson and Lee wrote a collection of musical ideas to fit Peart&#x27;s words. Peart recalled that his bandmates interrupted him as he was cleaning his car and set up a portable cassette player on the driveway outside the studio, and played him what they had come up with. Peart added: &quot;I listened closely, picking up the variations on 7/8 and 3/4, the way the guitar adopts the role of rhythm section while the keyboards take the melody, returning to bass with guitar leading in the chorus, then the Mini-moog taking over again for the instrumental bridge&quot;, and told Lifeson and Lee that he liked it.

&quot;The Analog Kid&quot; originated during the group&#x27;s stay at Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands in January 1982, travelling on a yacht named Orianda. Peart had written the words to the song initially as a companion piece to &quot;Digital Man&quot;, which Rush had started working on in late 1981, and presented it to Lee. The two discussed what could be done with the lyrics in a musical sense, deciding on the opposite on what the words may suggest, with Peart describing the track as &quot;a very up-tempo rocker, with some kind of a dynamic contrast for the choruses&quot;.

&quot;Chemistry&quot; was developed during soundchecks on the &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; tour in 1981. It was during one particular session during the United States leg whereby, after each member checking each of their instruments separately, &quot;a little spontaneous creation&quot; came about which produced a song without the group realising it. Each member played a different part; Lee played what became the keyboard section for the bridge, Lifeson the guitar riffs heard in the verses, and Peart the drum pattern for the chorus. Upon listening to the soundcheck tapes, Lifeson and Lee took each section and arranged it into a complete track before they produced a demo which almost matched the version recorded for the album. &quot;Chemistry&quot; marked the first time that each member collaborated on the lyrics to a song, with Lifeson and Lee devising its title, concept, and several phrases that they wished for it to include. Peart then took their ideas and developed a set of complete lyrics. He named &quot;Chemistry&quot; as the easiest song to write for &quot;Signals&quot;.

&quot;Digital Man&quot; was one of the songs worked on during the late 1981 writing sessions at Le Studio, during which the music and lyrics for its verses, plus the ska-influenced bridge, was worked out. The song was also heavily influenced by funk, with Lee&#x27;s bass line described as &quot;so funky and fluid its almost laughable&quot;. Its instrumental break has been compared with &quot;Walking on the Moon&quot; by The Police. The song developed further in March 1982 during the band&#x27;s one month stay at The Grange in Muskoka Lakes, Ontario. Peart wrote the remaining lyrics by an open fire in his chalet while Lifeson and Lee worked on the music in the adjacent barn. After numerous attempts they devised a combination of suitable words and music for the chorus, and Peart wrote: &quot;We were all very pleased with the dynamic and unusual nature of the part, it was so different for us&quot;. However, Brown expressed a lack of enthusiasm to record the song and remained so until the group had continually talked about why it worked &quot;until he got tired of hearing about it&quot;. &quot;The Analog Kid&quot; and &quot;Digital Man&quot; served as the inspiration for comic book writer Troy Hickman to create heroes of the same names in his 2004 comic &quot;Common Grounds&quot;.

===Side two===
&quot;The Weapon&quot; is the second part of Rush&#x27;s &quot;Fear&quot; song series. During a writing session at a northern Ontario manor home in 1981, Lee and his friend Oscar devised what Peart described as the foundation of &quot;a highly mysterious and bizarre drum pattern&quot; with his drum machine. At a subsequent rehearsal, Peart learned to play the part on his own drum kit which required him to alter his usual technique, but took the experience as an enjoyable challenge.

&quot;New World Man&quot; was put together in May 1982 when the backing tracks for the album&#x27;s other seven tracks were completed, and there was enough space on the vinyl for a song under four minutes. Had the track become too long, the band would have put it down and used it for a subsequent release. &quot;New World Man&quot; began with Peart writing lyrics that tied in themes from other songs on the album, &quot;and came up with a straightforward, concise set of lyrics consisting of the two verses and the two choruses&quot;. The group adopted a &quot;fast and loose&quot; approach for its corresponding music and worked swiftly, with the song fully arranged in one day and recorded in the course of the next.

&quot;Losing It&quot; originated from a theme Lifeson had come up with which was used in subsequent rehearsal sessions to produce a demo with keyboards and drums. In June 1982, when the band revisited the song in the studio, they discussed the possibility of Ben Mink of the band FM playing the electric violin somewhere on &quot;Signals&quot;, and decided that &quot;Losing It&quot; was the best track for his contribution. To cater for the part, Rush put down the basic track for a jazz-oriented solo section and invited Mink to the studio which included him multi-tracking various notes to resemble a complete string section. The lyrics include references to the latter years of writer Ernest Hemingway–&quot;For you the blind who once could see, the bell tolls for thee&quot;. It was not played live until 2015 when Rush performed it at five concerts on their R40 Live Tour.

&quot;Countdown&quot; was inspired by the band attending the launch of the STS-1 &quot;Columbia&quot; space shuttle in April 1981, the first of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program. They had been invited to the launch and observed it from a VIP area at an air base in Cape Kennedy, Florida. The song features samples of radio communications recorded before and during the flight.

==Artwork==
The sleeve was designed by Hugh Syme, who is credited with its concept, direction, and graphics, with photography from Deborah Samuel. Syme based his design upon receiving merely the album&#x27;s title, and recalled a &quot;great deal of trouble&quot; in a cover that he and the group were satisfied with. &quot;I decided that, with such a phenomenally important word with the kind of potency it potentially had, to go with something really dumb, really inane&quot;. He noted, however, that the cover still tied into the meaning of some of the songs on the album, in particular &quot;Chemistry&quot;. The final concept came out from the result of several failed ideas, including one that Syme devised which would have involved Rush hooked up to electroencephalography machines as they played in the studio and a snapshot of their heartbeats and brain waves taken during a performance.

The front photograph depicts a Dalmatian dog sniffing a red fire hydrant on a green lawn. Samuel shot the image on the rooftop of her studio. The lawn is a piece of AstroTurf, and the hydrant was rented from Toronto and repainted the desired colour for the cover. She recalled a search to find a Dalmatian who could sniff on command, and placed dog biscuits underneath the hydrant multiple times to get the final shot. The back cover is a pretend blueprint of a neighbourhood with what Lee described as &quot;make believe subdivisions&quot;, detailing Warren Cromartie Secondary School, a fictional school named after Canadian baseball player Warren Cromartie. He and the Montreal Expos are thanked in the album&#x27;s liner notes. Syme considered the back cover &quot;a little subtle, perhaps over-indulgent&quot;.

==Release==
The album was released in September 1982. The album peaked at No. 1 in Canada, No. 3 in the United Kingdom, and No. 10 in the United States. In November 1982, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling one million copies in the United States.

Rush released five singles from &quot;Signals&quot;. &quot;New World Man&quot; reached No. 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart for three weeks in October and November 1982. It is the band&#x27;s highest charting single in the US, and the only one to have reached the top 40.

==Reception==

At the time of release, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; criticised the band&#x27;s choice of &quot;emphasizing synthesizers at the expense of Alex Lifeson&#x27;s guitar,&quot; calling the album &quot;mostly a wasted effort.&quot;

&quot;Louder&quot; called &quot;Signals&quot; the 29th best album of the 80s.

AllMusic retrospectively praised the album, complimenting the band for not simply making &quot;Moving Pictures, Pt. II&quot;, continuing their exploration of the synthesizer and introducing more contemporary themes into the lyrics.

Ultimate Classic Rock placed &quot;Signals&quot; seventh in their list of &quot;Top 10 Rush Albums,&quot; while &quot;Stereogum&quot; placed the album third (behind &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; and &quot;2112&quot;) in their list of &quot;Rush Albums From Worst to Best,&quot; labelling it &quot;the most audacious album of the band&#x27;s career.&quot;

In the 2010 documentary film &quot;&quot;, Trent Reznor cited &quot;Signals&quot; as an influence for incorporating keyboards into hard rock. Canadian music journalist Martin Popoff stated that &quot;Signals&quot; was his favorite Rush album because of the &quot;creamy production.&quot;

In 2022, &quot;Guitar World&quot; named &quot;Signals&quot; the #9 greatest rock guitar album of 1982, saying that although there was a &quot;shift to a more electro-synth sound&quot;, there was &quot;still room for Alex Lifeson to do his thing on his six-string&quot;, and that &quot;Geddy Lee remained the best bassist in rock&quot;.

<text>Marcus Fabius Quintilianus (; 35 – 100 AD) was a Roman educator and rhetorician born in Hispania, widely referred to in medieval schools of rhetoric and in Renaissance writing. In English translation, he is usually referred to as Quintilian (), although the alternate spellings of Quintillian and Quinctilian are occasionally seen, the latter in older texts.

==Life==
Quintilian was born c. 35 AD in &quot;Calagurris&quot; (Calahorra, La Rioja) in Hispania. His father, a well-educated man, sent him to Rome to study rhetoric early in the reign of Nero. While there, he cultivated a relationship with Domitius Afer, who died in 59. &quot;It had always been the custom … for young men with ambitions in public life to fix upon some older model of their ambition … and regard him as a mentor&quot;. Quintilian evidently adopted Afer as his model and listened to him speak and plead cases in the law courts. Afer has been characterized as a more austere, classical, Ciceronian speaker than those common at the time of Seneca the Younger, and he may have inspired Quintilian&#x27;s love of Cicero.

Sometime after Afer&#x27;s death, Quintilian returned to Hispania, possibly to practice law in the courts of his own province. However, in 68, he returned to Rome as part of the retinue of Emperor Galba, Nero&#x27;s short-lived successor. Quintilian does not appear to have been a close advisor of the Emperor, which probably ensured his survival after the assassination of Galba in 69.

After Galba&#x27;s death, and during the chaotic Year of the Four Emperors which followed, Quintilian opened a public school of rhetoric. Among his students were Pliny the Younger, and perhaps Tacitus. The Emperor Vespasian made him a &quot;consul.&quot; The emperor &quot;in general was not especially interested in the arts, but … was interested in education as a means of creating an intelligent and responsible ruling class&quot;. This subsidy enabled Quintilian to devote more time to the school. In addition, he appeared in the courts of law, arguing on behalf of clients.

Of his personal life, little is known. In the &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot;, he mentions a wife who died young, as well as two sons who predeceased him.

Quintilian retired from teaching and pleading in 88 AD, during the reign of Domitian. His retirement may have been prompted by his achievement of financial security and his desire to become a gentleman of leisure. Quintilian survived several emperors; the reigns of Vespasian and Titus were relatively peaceful, but that of Domitian was reputed to be difficult. Domitian&#x27;s cruelty and paranoia may have prompted the rhetorician to distance himself quietly. The emperor does not appear to have taken offence as he made Quintilian tutor of his two grand-nephews in 90 AD. He is believed to have died sometime around 100 AD, not having long survived Domitian, who was assassinated in 96.

==Works==
The only extant work of Quintilian is a twelve-volume textbook on rhetoric entitled &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot; (generally referred to in English as the &quot;Institutes of Oratory&quot;), written around 95 AD. This work deals not only with the theory and practice of rhetoric, but also with the foundational education and development of the orator, providing advice that ran from the cradle to the grave. An earlier text, &quot;De Causis Corruptae Eloquentiae&quot; (&quot;On the Causes of Corrupted Eloquence&quot;) has been lost, but is believed to have been &quot;a preliminary exposition of some of the views later set forth in [&quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot;]&quot;.

In addition, there are two sets of declamations, &quot;Declamationes Maiores&quot; and &quot;Declamationes Minores&quot;, which have been attributed to Quintilian. However, there is some dispute over the real writer of these texts: &quot;Some modern scholars believe that the declamations circulated in his name represent the lecture notes of a scholar either using Quintilian&#x27;s system or actually trained by him&quot;.

===&quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot;===

&quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot; (English: &quot;Institutes of Oratory&quot;) is a twelve-volume textbook on the theory and practice of rhetoric by Roman rhetorician Quintilian. It was written around year 95 AD. The work deals also with the foundational education and development of orators. In this work, Quintilian establishes that the perfect orator is first a good man, and after that he is a good speaker. He also believed that a speech should stay genuine to a message that is &quot;just and honorable&quot;. This came to be known as his &quot;good man theory&quot;, embracing the message that if one cannot be genuinely good, then one cannot be a good speaker for the people. This theory also revolves around being of service to the people. He asserts that a good man is one who works for the good of the people and the prosperity of society.

Quintilian wrote &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot; in the last years of Domitian&#x27;s rule of the Roman Empire. He had worked alongside Domitian, but as he began to write more and ease away from Emperor Domitian&#x27;s complete power, the emperor did not seem to mind. The emperor was so impressed with Quintilian&#x27;s devotion to education that he hired him to be a tutor for his family. Domitian was in the harshest period of his rule at that time and almost no one had the courage to speak any idea that was unlike his, but Quintilian did. He spoke as an orator in the tradition of Cicero, such as had not been seen since the beginning of the reign of Augustus. Rather than pleading cases, as an orator of his era might have been expected to do, he concentrated on speaking in more general terms about how sound rhetoric influences the education of the people.

== Placement of Quintilian&#x27;s rhetoric ==

Quintilian cites many authors in the &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot; before providing his own definition of rhetoric. His rhetoric is chiefly defined by Cato the Elder&#x27;s &quot;vir bonus, dicendi peritus&quot;, or &quot;the good man skilled at speaking&quot;. Later he states: &quot;I should like the orator I am training to be a sort of Roman Wise Man&quot;. Quintilian also &quot;insists that his ideal orator is no philosopher because the philosopher does not take as a duty participation in civic life; this is constitutive of Quintilian&#x27;s (and Isocrates&#x27; and Cicero&#x27;s) ideal orator&quot;. Though he calls for imitation, he also urges the orator to use this knowledge to inspire his own original invention.

No author receives greater praise in the &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot; than Cicero: &quot;For who can instruct with greater thoroughness, or more deeply stir the emotions? Who has ever possessed such a gift of charm?&quot;. Quintilian&#x27;s definition of rhetoric shares many similarities with that of Cicero, one being the importance of the speaker&#x27;s moral character. Like Cicero, Quintilian also believes that &quot;history and philosophy can increase an orator&#x27;s command of &quot;copia&quot; and style;&quot; they differ in that Quintilian &quot;features the character of the orator, as well as the art&quot;.

In Book II, Quintilian sides with Plato&#x27;s assertion in the &quot;Phaedrus&quot; that the rhetorician must be just: &quot;In the &quot;Phaedrus&quot;, Plato makes it even clearer that the complete attainment of this art is even impossible without the knowledge of justice, an opinion in which I heartily concur&quot;. Their views are further similar in their treatment of &quot;(1) the inseparability, in more respects than one, of wisdom, goodness, and eloquence; and (2) the morally ideological nature of rhetoric. [...] For both, there are conceptual connections between rhetoric and justice which rule out the possibility of [an] amorally neutral conception of rhetoric. For both, rhetoric is &#x27;speaking well,&#x27; and for both &#x27;speaking well&#x27; means speaking justly&quot;.

==Influence of Quintilian==
The influence of Quintilian&#x27;s masterwork, &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot;, can be felt in several areas. First of all, there is his criticism of the orator Seneca the Younger. Quintilian was attempting to modify the prevailing imperial style of oratory with his book, and Seneca was the principal figure in that style&#x27;s tradition. He was more recent than many of the authors mentioned by Quintilian, but his reputation within the post-classical style necessitated both his mention and the criticism or back-handed praise that is given to him. Quintilian believed that &quot;his style is for the most part corrupt and extremely dangerous because it abounds in attractive faults&quot;. Seneca was regarded as doubly dangerous because his style was sometimes attractive. This reading of Seneca &quot;has heavily coloured subsequent judgments of Seneca and his style&quot;.

Quintilian also made an impression on Martial, the Latin poet. A short poem, written in 86 AD, was addressed to him, and opened, &quot;Quintilian, greatest director of straying youth, / you are an honour, Quintilian, to the Roman toga&quot;. However, one should not take Martial&#x27;s praise at face value, since he was known for his sly and witty insults. The opening lines are all that are usually quoted, but the rest of the poem contains lines such as &quot;A man who longs to surpass his father&#x27;s census rating&quot; (6). This speaks of Quintilian&#x27;s ambitious side and his drive for wealth and position.

After his death, Quintilian&#x27;s influence fluctuated. He was mentioned by his pupil, Pliny, and by Juvenal, who may have been another student, &quot;as an example of sobriety and of worldly success unusual in the teaching profession&quot;. During the 3rd to 5th centuries, his influence was felt among such authors as St. Augustine of Hippo, whose discussion of signs and figurative language certainly owed something to Quintilian, and to St. Jerome, editor of the Vulgate Bible, whose theories on education are clearly influenced by Quintilian&#x27;s. The Middle Ages saw a decline in knowledge of his work, since existing manuscripts of &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot; were fragmented, but the Italian humanists revived interest in the work after the discovery by Poggio Bracciolini in 1416 of a forgotten, complete manuscript in the Abbey of Saint Gall, which he found &quot;buried in rubbish and dust&quot; in a filthy dungeon. The influential scholar Leonardo Bruni, considered the first modern historian, greeted the news by writing to his friend Poggio: 
It will be your glory to restore to the present age, by your labour and diligence, the writings of excellent authors, which have hitherto escaped the researches of the learned... Oh! what a valuable acquisition! What an unexpected pleasure! Shall I then behold Quintilian whole and entire, who, even in his imperfect state, was so rich a source of delight?... But Quintilian is so consummate a master of rhetoric and oratory, that when, after having delivered him from his long imprisonment in the dungeons of the barbarians, you transmit him to this country, all the nations of Italy ought to assemble to bid him welcome... Quintilian, an author whose works I will not hesitate to affirm, are more an object of desire to the learned than any others, excepting only Cicero&#x27;s dissertation &quot;De Republica.&quot;The Italian poet Petrarch addressed one of his letters to the dead to Quintilian, and for many he &quot;provided the inspiration for a new humanistic philosophy of education&quot;. This enthusiasm for Quintilian spread with humanism itself, reaching northern Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries. Martin Luther, the German theologian and ecclesiastical reformer, &quot;claimed that he preferred Quintilian to almost all authors, &#x27;in that he educates and at the same time demonstrates eloquence, that is, he teaches in word and in deed most happily&#x27;&quot;. The influence of Quintilian&#x27;s works is also seen in Luther&#x27;s contemporary Erasmus of Rotterdam. He above all shaped the implicit depth of humanism and had studied at Steyn.

It has been argued by a musicologist, Ursula Kirkendale, that the composition of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;Das musikalische Opfer&quot; (The Musical Offering, BWV 1079), was closely connected with the &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot;. Among Bach&#x27;s duties during his tenure at Leipzig (1723–1750) was teaching Latin; his early training included rhetoric. (Philologist and Rector of the Leipzig Thomasschule, Johann Matthias Gesner, for whom Bach composed a cantata in 1729, published a substantial Quintilian edition with a long footnote in Bach&#x27;s honor.)

After this high point, Quintilian&#x27;s influence seems to have lessened somewhat, although he is mentioned by the English poet Alexander Pope in his versified &quot;An Essay on Criticism&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;In grave Quintilian&#x27;s copious works we find
The justest rules and clearest method join&#x27;d (lines 669–70).&lt;/poem&gt;

In addition, &quot;he is often mentioned by writers like Montaigne and Lessing... but he made no major contribution to intellectual history, and by the nineteenth century he seemed to be... rather little read and rarely edited&quot;. However, in his celebrated &quot;Autobiography,&quot; John Stuart Mill (arguably the nineteenth-century&#x27;s most influential English intellectual) spoke highly of Quintilian as a force in his early education. He wrote that Quintilian, while little-read in Mill&#x27;s day due to &quot;his obscure style and to the scholastic details of which many parts of his treatise are made up&quot;, was &quot;seldom sufficiently appreciated.&quot; &quot;His book,&quot; Mill continued, &quot;is a kind of encyclopaedia of the thoughts of the ancients on the whole field of education and culture; and I have retained through life many valuable ideas which I can distinctly trace to my reading of him...&quot;. He was also highly praised by Thomas De Quincey: &quot;[F]or elegance and as a practical model in the art he was expounding, neither Aristotle, nor any less austere among the Greek rhetoricians, has any pretensions to measure himself with Quintilian. In reality, for a triumph over the difficulties of the subject, and as a lesson on the possibility of imparting grace to the treatment of scholastic topics, naturally as intractable as that of Grammar or Prosody, there is no such chef-d&#x27;œuvre to this hour in any literature, as the Institutions of Quintilian&quot;.

In more recent times, Quintilian appears to have made another upward turn. He is frequently included in anthologies of literary criticism, and is an integral part of the history of education. He is believed to be the &quot;earliest spokesman for a child-centered education&quot;, which is discussed above under his early childhood education theories. As well, he has something to offer students of speech, professional writing, and rhetoric, because of the great detail with which he covers the rhetorical system. His discussions of tropes and figures also formed the foundation of contemporary works on the nature of figurative language, including the post-structuralist and formalist theories. For example, the works of Jacques Derrida on the failure of language to impart the truth of the objects it is meant to represent would not be possible without Quintilian&#x27;s assumptions about the function of figurative language and tropes.

<text>The concept of an Ogdoad (Greek: ὀγδοάς) appears in Gnostic systems of the early Christian era, and was further developed by the theologian Valentinus (&quot;ca&quot;. 160 AD).

The number eight plays an important part in Gnostic systems, and it is necessary to distinguish the different forms in which it appeared at different stages in the development of Gnosticism. The earliest Gnostic systems included a theory of seven heavens and a supercelestial region called the Ogdoad. Astronomical theories had introduced the concept of seven planetary spheres with an eighth above them, the sphere of the fixed stars.

In the system of Valentinus, the seven heavens, and even the region above them, were regarded as but the lowest and last stage of the exercise of creative power. Above them was the Pleroma, where were exhibited the first manifestations of the evolution of subordinate existence from the great First Principle.

== 7 + 1 System ==

=== Seven heavens ===
All the early Gnostics of whose opinions Irenaeus gives an account, in a section () probably derived from an earlier writer, agree in the doctrine that the world was made by the instrumentality of archons (angels). The brief account given of the teaching of the first two in the list, Simon and Menander, does not state whether or not they defined the number of these archons; but it is expressly told of the third, Saturninus (), that he counted them as seven. At the end of the first book of Irenaeus is a section to all appearance derived from a source different from that just referred to. He here () relates the opinions of heretics to whom he himself gives no title, but whom his copyist Theodoret (&quot;Haer. Fab.&quot; i. 14) calls Ophites. The Ophite teaching may be used to illustrate that of Saturninus, his connexion with that school being closer than with any other. It would have been natural to think that the number of seven archons was suggested to Saturninus by astronomical considerations; and this supposition is verified by the statement in the later chapter () that the holy Hebdomas are the seven stars called planets. In fact, the sphere of the seven stars, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon, were supposed to be presided over, each by a different archon. Their names are differently given; Irenaeus (c. 30) giving them, Ialdabaoth, the chief, Iao, Sabaoth, Adonaeus, Eloaeus, Oreus, and Astaphaeus. With this closely agrees Origen, who, writing of the Ophites (&quot;Adv. Cels.&quot; , ), gives the names Ialdabaoth, Iao, Sabaoth, Adonaeus, Astaphaeus, Eloaeus, Horaeus. Epiphanius (&quot;Haer.&quot; 26, p. 91), relating the opinions of what was clearly a branch of the same school, places in the highest heaven Ialdabaoth or, according to others, Sabaoth; in the next, Elilaeus according to one version, Ialdabaoth according to the other; in the next Adonaeus and Eloaeus; beneath these Dades, Seth, and Saclas; lowest of all Iao. It was thought that each of the Jewish prophets was sent by a different one of these seven archons, whose special glory that prophet was to declare. Thus () the first archon sent Moses, Joshua, Amos, and Habakkuk; the second Samuel, Nathan, Jonah, and Micah; the third Elijah, Joel, and Zechariah; the fourth Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and Daniel; the fifth Book of Tobit and Haggai; the sixth Micah (&quot;qu.&quot; Malachi?) and Nahum; the seventh Ezra and Zephaniah.

=== Eighth sphere ===
The ancient astronomy taught that above the seven planetary spheres was an eighth, the sphere of the fixed stars (Clem. Alex. &quot;Strom&quot;. , xxv. p. 636: see also his quotation, , p. 692, of a mention of the fifth heaven in apocryphal writings ascribed to Zephaniah). In the eighth sphere, these Gnostics taught, dwelt the mother to whom all these archons owed their origin, Sophia or Prunikos according to the version of Irenaeus, Barbelo according to that of Epiphanius. In the language of these sects the word hebdomad not only denotes the seven archons, but is also a name of place, denoting the heavenly regions over which the seven archons presided; while Ogdoad denotes the supercelestial regions which lay above their control.

Again, beside the higher hebdomad of the seven archons, the Ophite system told of a lower hebdomad. After the serpent in punishment for having taught the first parents to transgress the commands of Ialdabaoth was cast down into this lower world, he begat himself six sons, who with himself form a hebdomad, the counterpart of that of which his father Ialdabaoth is chief. These are the seven demons, the scene of whose activity is this lower earth, not the heavens; and who delight in injuring the human race on whose account their father had been cast down. Origen () gives their names and forms from an Ophite diagram; Michael in form as a lion, Suriel as an ox, Raphael as a dragon, Gabriel as an eagle, Thauthabaoth as a bear, Erataoth as a dog, Onoel or Thartharaoth as an ass.

It does not appear that the Oriental philosophy, or the earliest Gnostic systems, recognised any place higher than the eighth sphere; and it is here that according to the account of Epiphanius (&quot;Haer.&quot; 26, p. 91) dwelt Barbelo the mother of all. But Grecian philosophy came to teach that above the sensible world there lay a still higher, and Clem. Alex. () speaks of the eighth sphere as lying nearest &quot;to noeto kosmo&quot;. Accordingly, those Gnostic systems which are tinctured by Grecian philosophy, while leaving untouched the doctrine of seven or eight material heavens, develop in various ways the theory of the region above them. In the system of Basilides, as reported by Hippolytus (), Ogdoad and Hebdomad are merely names of place. In that system the universe is divided into the Kosmos and the hypercosmical region. At the highest point of the Kosmos presides the great archon, ruling over the Ogdoad, or ethereal region, which is described as reaching down to the moon. Beneath the Ogdoad is the Hebdomad presided over by its own archon. In one place (p. 238) the names Ogdoad and Hebdomad seem to be given to the archons themselves. In any case the names shew marks of having been derived from a previous system, for the system of Basilides itself gives no account of the numbers seven or eight; and the number of heavens is not limited to seven, as many as 365 being counted. In &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;, the doctrine of the higher regions receives such enormous development that the seven planetary spheres are thought of as contemptibly low; and Ialdabaoth, once their ruler, in this book sinks to a demon.

The word Hebdomad occurs also in the Clementine &quot;Homilies&quot;, but its use there is quite unconnected with the teaching hitherto described. The mystery of the Hebdomad there unfolded () is an independent exposition of the six days&#x27; work of creation, and the seventh day&#x27;s rest; illustrated by the six directions, into which infinite space extends, viz. up, down, right, left, backward, forward, together with the central point considered as making a seventh.

The mysteries of the number seven are treated of by Clem. Alex. (), and in the source whence he borrowed (Philo, &quot;de Op. Mund.&quot; and &quot;Leg. Allegor&quot;., where the theme is enlarged on, &quot;khairei he physis hebdomadi&quot;).

== 6 + 2 System ==
In the system of Valentinus again the names Ogdoad and Hebdomad occur in the same signification. Above this lower world are the seven heavens, where dwells their maker the Demiurge himself also, on that account, called Hebdomas (). Of these seven heavens Marcus taught in more detail (). Above these heavens is the Ogdoad, also called &quot;he mesotes&quot;, and Jerusalem above, the abode of Achamoth, who herself also is called Ogdoad (; ). Over the Ogdoad is the Pleroma, the abode of the Aeons. Thus (Hippol. p. 195), we have the threefold division, &quot;ta kata tous aionas, ta kata ten ogdoada, ta kata ten hebdomada&quot;. This use of the words Hebdomad and Ogdoad also bears traces of derivation from a previous system, the word Ogdoad occurring in a different sense in the system of Valentinus himself, whose Ogdoad within the Pleroma was probably intended to answer to the Ogdoad outside. Irenaeus () argues from what is told of Paul&#x27;s ascent to the third heaven against the low place assigned to the heavens in the Valentinian scheme.

=== First Ogdoad ===
In the earliest stages of that evolution we have (Iren. I. i.) eight primary Aeons constituting the first Ogdoad. The ultimate conception of God, named the Ineffable Father and who has existed since before the beginning, is described as Depth or Profundity (Bythos). All around him exists a female power that has been named Silence (Sige). These two deities, Depth and Silence, become the cause, through a process of emanation, of the other archetypal beings or Aeons. The Aeons are always born in male-female pairs (as syzygies), each of which is in itself a divine principle but at the same time represents one aspect of the Ineffable Father, who otherwise could not be described nor comprehended as he is beyond all names. The emanation takes place in the following manner: Depth-and-Silence gives birth to Mind-and-Truth (Nous and Aletheia), who gives birth to Word-and-Life (Logos and ), who gives birth to Man-and-Church (Anthropos and Ecclesia). These Aeonic pairs comprise the Fullness of Godhead (Pleroma), and the first eight Aeons that have been expounded here are the Valentinian Ogdoad.

Though this Ogdoad is first in order of evolution, if the Valentinian theory be accepted as true, yet to us who trace the history of the development of that system the lower Ogdoad must clearly be pronounced the first, and the higher only as a subsequent extension of the previously accepted action of an Ogdoad. Possibly also the Egyptian doctrine of eight primary gods (see above) may have contributed to the formation of a theory of which Egypt was the birthplace. In any case an Ogdoad 7 + 1 would have been inconsistent with a theory an essential part of which was the coupling its characters in pairs, male and female. Hippolytus of Rome (&quot;Ref&quot;. vi. 20, p. 176) connects the system of Valentinus with that of Simon, in which the origin of things is traced to a central first principle, together with six &quot;roots.&quot; If for the one first principle we substitute a male and female principle, the 6 + 1 of Simon becomes the 6 + 2 of Valentinus. This very question, however, whether the first principle were to be regarded as single or twofold was one on which the Valentinians themselves were not agreed; and their differences as to the manner of counting the numbers of the primary Ogdoad confirm what has been said as to the later origin of this doctrine.

== 4 + 4 System ==
The doctrine of an Ogdoad of the commencement of finite existence having been established by Valentinus, those of his followers who had been imbued with the Pythagorean philosophy introduced a modification. In that philosophy the Tetrad was regarded with peculiar veneration, and held to be the foundation of the sensible world. The Pythagorean oath by the Tetrad is well known.

The Valentinian Secundus divided the Ogdoad into a right-hand and a left-hand Tetrad (Iren. I. xi.); and in the case of Marcus, who largely uses Pythagorean speculations about numbers, the Tetrad holds the highest place in the system.

<text>Nu (&quot;Watery One&quot;) or Nun (&quot;The Inert One&quot;) (Ancient Egyptian: ; Coptic: ), in ancient Egyptian religion, is the personification of the primordial watery abyss which existed at the time of creation and from which the creator sun god Ra arose.

Nu is one of the eight deities of the Ogdoad representing ancient Egyptian primordial Chaos from which the primordial mound arose. Nun can be seen as the first of all the gods and the creator of reality and personification of the cosmos. Nun is also considered the god that will destroy existence and return everything to the Nun whence it came. No cult was addressed to Nun.

Nun&#x27;s consort (or his female aspect) was the goddess Nunut or Naunet (Ancient Egyptian: ).

==Name==
The name on Nu is paralleled with &quot;inactivity&quot; in a play of words in, &quot;I raised them up from out of the watery mass [], out of inactivity []&quot;. The name has also been compared to the Coptic &quot;noun&quot; &quot;abyss; deep&quot;.

==Origin myth==

The ancient Egyptians envisaged the oceanic abyss of the Nun as surrounding a bubble in which the sphere of life is encapsulated, representing the deepest mystery of their cosmogony. In ancient Egyptian creation accounts, the original mound of land comes forth from the waters of the Nun. The Nun is the source of all that appears in a differentiated world, encompassing all aspects of divine and earthly existence. In the Ennead cosmogony, Nun is perceived as transcendent at the point of creation alongside Atum the creator god.

=== Creation myth ===

In the beginning the universe only consisted of a great chaotic cosmic ocean, and the ocean itself was referred to as Nu. In some versions of this myth, at the beginning of time Mehet-Weret, portrayed as a cow with a sun disk between her horns, gives birth to the sun, said to have risen from the waters of creation and to have given birth to the sun god Ra in some myths. The universe was enrapt by a vast mass of primordial waters, and the Benben, a pyramid mound, emerged amid this primal chaos. There was a lotus flower with Benben, and from this when it blossomed emerged Ra. There were many versions of the sun&#x27;s emergence, and it was said to have emerged directly from the mound or from a lotus flower that grew from the mound, in the form of a heron, falcon, scarab beetle, or human child. In Heliopolis, the creation was attributed to Atum, a deity closely associated with Ra, who was said to have existed in the waters of Nu as an inert potential being.

==History==
Beginning with the Middle Kingdom, Nun is described as &quot;the father of the gods&quot; and he is depicted on temple walls throughout the rest of ancient Egyptian religious history.

The Ogdoad includes along with Naunet and Nun, Amaunet and Amun; Hauhet and Heh; and Kauket and Kek. Like the other Ogdoad deities, Nu did not have temples or any center of worship. Even so, Nu was sometimes represented by a sacred lake, or, as at Abydos, by an underground stream.

== Iconography ==
Nun was depicted as an anthropomorphic large figure and a personification of the primordial waters, with water ripples filling the body, holding a notched palm branch. Nun was also depicted in anthropomorphic form but with the head of a frog, and he was typically depicted in ancient Egyptian art holding aloft the solar barque or the sun disc. He may appear greeting the rising sun in the guise of a baboon. Nun is otherwise symbolized by the presence of a sacred cistern or lake as in the sanctuaries of Karnak and Dendara.
Nu was shown usually as male but also had aspects that could be represented as female or male. Naunet (also spelt Nunet) is the female aspect, which is the name &quot;Nu&quot; with a female gender ending. The male aspect, Nun, is written with a male gender ending. As with the primordial concepts of the Ogdoad, Nu&#x27;s male aspect was depicted as a frog, or a frog-headed man. In Ancient Egyptian art, Nun also appears as a bearded man, with blue-green skin, representing water. Naunet is represented as a snake or snake-headed woman.

In the 12th Hour of the Book of Gates, Nu is depicted with upraised arms holding a solar bark (or barque, a boat). The boat is occupied by eight deities with Khepri, Ra&#x27;s morning aspect, standing in the middle and being surrounded by the seven other deities.

During the Late Period when Egypt was occupied by foreign powers, the negative aspect of Nun (ie. chaos) became the dominant perception, reflecting the forces of disorder that were set loose in the country.

<doc id="97098" wikidata="Q234911" url="?curid=97098" title="Gabrielle d'Estrées">
<text>Gabrielle d&#x27;Estrées, Duchess of Beaufort and Verneuil, Marchioness of Monceaux (; 157310 April 1599) was a mistress, confidante and adviser of Henry IV of France. She is noted for her role in ending the religious civil wars that plagued France for more than 30 years.

She persuaded Henry to renounce Protestantism in favour of Catholicism in 1593. Later she urged French Catholics to accept the Edict of Nantes, which granted certain rights to the Protestants. As it was legally impossible for the King to marry her as he was already married to Margaret of Valois, he controversially petitioned Pope Clement VIII for an annulment in February 1599 to end his childless first marriage, and announced his intention to marry Gabrielle and have her crowned the next Queen of France, while legitimizing their three children born out of wedlock. Her coronation and wedding never occurred due to her untimely and sudden death.

==Birth==

Gabrielle d&#x27;Estrées was born at either the Château de la Bourdaisière in Montlouis-sur-Loire in Touraine, or at the Château de Cœuvres in Picardy. Her parents were Antoine d&#x27;Estrées, Marquis of Cœuvres, and Françoise Babou de La Bourdaisière. The women in her family, particularly on her mother&#x27;s side, were noted for the beauty prized in the French royal court. Her sister Diane became the mistress of Épernon and her aunt Isabelle also had the same relationship with Chancellor Philippe Hurault de Cheverny.

==Royal mistress==
In November 1590, King Henry IV of France fell in love with Gabrielle d&#x27;Estrées. She became one of his many mistresses in the middle of his bitter struggle with the Catholic League. Although he was married to Margaret of Valois, Henry and Gabrielle were openly affectionate with each other in public. Her father, anxious to save his daughter from so perilous an entanglement, married her to Nicholas d&#x27;Amerval, seigneur de Liancourt, though the union proved unhappy, and was annulled by 1595.

Fiercely loyal, Gabrielle accompanied Henry during his campaigns. Even when heavily pregnant, she insisted on living inside his tent near the battlefield, making sure his clothing was clean and that he ate well after a battle, handling the day-to-day correspondence while he fought. As she was intelligent and practical, Henry confided his secrets to her and followed her advice. When the two were apart, Henry frequently wrote her letters while on his sojourn trips at war camps.
Born a Catholic, Gabrielle knew that the best way to conclude the religious wars was for Henry himself to become a Catholic. Her argument was that the League&#x27;s strongholds in Paris and Rouen would support him once he renounced Protestantism, and that the citizens could also be persuaded to side with him against the League, if they were made to see that it was a pawn of foreign powers. Recognizing the wisdom in her argument, on 25 July 1593, Henry supposedly declared that &quot;Paris is well worth a Mass&quot; when he permanently renounced Protestantism. This enabled him to be crowned King of France on 27 February 1594. Henry also arranged for Gabrielle&#x27;s marriage to Liancourt to be annulled the same year.

On 7 June 1594, their first child was born: a son, César de Bourbon, future Duke of Vendôme. On 4 January 1595, Henry IV officially recognized and legitimized his son in a text validated by the Parlement of Paris. In that text he also recognized Gabrielle d&#x27;Estrées as the mother of his son and as &quot;the subject the most worthy of our friendship&quot;; in other words, Henry IV had the Parlement of Paris officially ratify Gabrielle&#x27;s position as his mistress. In 1596, he made her Marquise de Montceaux, and she purchased from the estate of Catherine de&#x27; Medici the Château de Montceaux at auction for 39,000 &quot;écus&quot;, money which he probably gave her. In the following year he made her Duchesse de Beaufort, a peeress of France.

Henry IV also recognized and legitimized two more children he had with Gabrielle: Catherine-Henriette de Bourbon, a daughter born in 1596, and Alexandre de Bourbon, a son born in 1598. The relationship between Henry and Gabrielle did not sit well with some members of the French aristocracy, and malicious pamphlets circulated that blamed the new duchess for many national misfortunes. One of the most vicious nicknames ascribed to Gabrielle was &quot;la duchesse d&#x27;Ordure&quot; (&quot;the Duchess of Filth&quot;).

Gabrielle became Henry&#x27;s most important diplomat, using her female friends amongst the various Catholic League families to bring about peace. In March 1596, Henry gave both Gabrielle and his sister Catherine a set of gold keys, which bestowed upon them seats on his council. This gift pleased Gabrielle so much that she took to wearing the little keys on a chain around her neck.

In 1598, Henry issued the Edict of Nantes, which gave the Huguenots certain rights, while deferring to Catholics. Joining forces, the Huguenot Catherine and the Catholic Gabrielle went to work overriding the objections of powerful Catholics and Huguenots, forcing compliance with the edict. Henry was so impressed with her efforts that he wrote: &quot;My mistress has become an orator of unequaled brilliance, so fiercely does she argue the cause of the new Edict.&quot;

==Death and aftermath==
After applying to Pope Clement VIII for an annulment of his marriage and authority to remarry, in March 1599 Henry gave his mistress his coronation ring. Gabrielle, so sure that the wedding would take place, stated, &quot;Only God or the king&#x27;s death could put an end to my good luck&quot;. A few days later, on 9 April, she suffered an attack of eclampsia and gave birth to a stillborn son. King Henry was at the Château de Fontainebleau when news arrived of her illness. The next day, 10 April 1599, while Henry was on his way to her, she died in Paris.

The King was grief-stricken, especially given the widely held rumor that Gabrielle had been poisoned. He wore black in mourning, something no previous French monarch had done. He gave her the funeral of a queen; her coffin was transported amidst a procession of princes, princesses, and nobles to the Saint-Germain-l&#x27;Auxerrois church in Paris, for a requiem mass. Remembered in French history and song as &quot;La Belle Gabrielle&quot;, she was interred in the Notre-Dame-La-Royale at Maubuisson Abbey in Saint-Ouen-l&#x27;Aumône (Val-d&#x27;Oise, Île-de-France).

A publication after her death called the &quot;Mémoires secrets de Gabrielle d&#x27;Estrée&quot; (&quot;The Secret Memoirs of Gabrielle d&#x27;Estrée&quot;) is believed to have been written by one of her friends.

==Children==
Her four children with Henry were:
* César, Duke of Vendôme (1594–1665); married Françoise de Lorraine and had issue. In 1626, he participated in a plot against Cardinal Richelieu. César was captured and held in prison for three years. In 1641 he was accused of conspiracy again and this time fled to England.
* Catherine Henriette de Bourbon (1596–1663); married Charles II, Duke of Elbeuf. Had issue
* Alexandre, Chevalier de Vendôme (1598–1629).
* stillborn son* (1599).
==Representation in art==
Gabrielle is the subject of the painting &quot;Gabrielle d&#x27;Estrées et une de ses sœurs&quot; by Francois Clouet, which is held in the Louvre Museum in Paris. In the painting, Gabrielle sits unclothed in a bathtub which is covered in cloth, holding what is presumed to be Henry&#x27;s coronation ring given to her before their wedding and her death, whilst her sister Julienne-Hippolyte-Joséphine, Duchess of Villars, also sits unclothed beside her and pinches Gabrielle’s right nipple. Henry gave Gabrielle the ring as a token of his love shortly before she died. 

A very similar painting with the same characters in different positions is in the Palace of Fontainebleau, and yet a third one without her sister in the Musée Condé in the Château de Chantilly.

J. M. W. Turner painted a watercolour of &quot;Fair Gabrielle&quot; at Bougival.

<text>Amunet () or Imnt (&quot;The Hidden One&quot; in hieroglyphics; also spelled Amonet or Amaunet; ) is a primordial goddess in ancient Egyptian religion. Thebes was the center of her worship through the last dynasty, the Ptolemaic Kingdom, in 30 BCE. She is attested in the earliest known of Egyptian religious texts and, as was the custom, was paired with a counterpart who is entitled with the same name, but in the masculine, Amun. They were thought to have existed prior to the beginning of creation along with three other couples representing primeval concepts.

== Description and history ==

=== Primeval counterparts ===
The goddess originated as a female doublet of the god Amun. Female doublets are distinguished from their male counterparts mainly by the feminine ending of their name. They did not a receive a cult worship of their own until the late period. The most famous Female doublets are the four pairs of the Ogdoad of which Amunet was originally a part of. Her name, , is a feminine noun that means &quot;The Hidden One&quot;.As a member of the Ogdoad of Hermopolis, she represented aspects of the primeval existence before the creation: Amunet was paired with Amun—whose name also means &quot;The Hidden One&quot;, with a masculine ending (&quot;&quot;)—within this divine group, from the earliest known documentation. Such pairing of deities is characteristic of the religious concepts of the ancient Egyptians. In early concepts known as the Ogdoad, the primeval deity group to which they belonged as &quot;Night&quot; (or as the determinative D41 meaning &quot;to halt, stop, deny&quot;, suggesting the principle of inactivity or repose), was composed of four balanced couples of deities or deified primeval concepts.

The Pyramid Texts, the earliest known religious texts of Ancient Egypt, mention &quot;the beneficent shadow of Amun and Amunet&quot;:

The German Egyptologist Kurt Sethe suggests that the names Amun and Amaunet were originally used as epithets for the twin pair Shu and Tefnut, who, in the Heliopolitan tradition, were the first children of the creator god Atum. Sethe further proposed that the eight primeval gods were established in the early religion of Memphis as the manifestations of the creator-god Ptah. The theology of Memphis placed Ptah on the top of the creation chain by making him the embodiement of the primordial waters from which Atum was born. Originally, Amunet was intended as the consort of Amun, just as the other female members of the Ogdoad formed pairs with their male counterparts. The cosmogonic text Theb. T. 283b describes the emergence of the female members of the Ogdoad with the following words: &quot;The Eight came into being there (in Thebes), consisting of their four men and one woman for each.&quot;

The move of the cult of Amun and Amunet from Hermopolis to Thebes likely occurred no earlier than in the 11th Dynasty. The earliest records of Theban worship of Amun appear during the reign of King Intef the Great, who expanded Theban control northward, seizing Abydos and pushing the frontier to the 10th nome.At that time, Hermopolis, the home of the Ogdoad and Amunet as one of its members, belonged to the kings of th 10th dynasty who ruled from Heracleopolis Magna. The establishment of a distinct cult for Amun and Amunet in Thebes may have been a strategic move by the Thebans to undermine their rivals by appropriating a deity of significant importance to them.It is possible that a Theban king established a new sanctuary for Amun in Thebes to claim the god’s support and strengthen his rule. Amun’s role as an oracle deity may have also positioned Thebes as a competing religious center against Hermopolis 

=== Cult becomes localized ===
By at least the Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt (c. 1991–1803 BC), Amunet often was superseded by Mut as Amun&#x27;s partner, as cults evolved or similar ones in other regions were merged following Mentuhotep II&#x27;s reunification of Egypt—but Amunet remained locally important in Thebes, where Amun was worshipped. In that capitol of the unified country she was seen as a protector of the king, playing a preeminent role in rituals associated with the royal coronation (&quot;khaj-nisut&quot;) and Sed festivals (&quot;heb-sed&quot;) celebrating its well-celebrated anniversaries, and priests were dedicated to Amunet&#x27;s service at Karnak, Amun&#x27;s cult center. In contrast to Mut, Amunet has been described as a merely a feminine abstraction of Amun, parallel to the other female-male pairs of the Ogdoad which she originally belonged to. Unlike the other female members of the Ogdoad, her cult grew in the Later period and a number of priests of Amunet are known from hieroglyphic and demonis sources. During festivaels she was represented by her own divine bark and a Roman Period Papyrus even mentions an edifice within Karnak called the open court of Amunet’as an important stop in the Khoiak festival. She held titles such as „Amunet the very great, lady of the two lands within Karnak“, and „Ruler in Thebes“, and is the only goddess mentioned within the Karnak temple complex in the Ramesside „Litany of Victorious Thebes“, as well as being the only one listed with Amun together as the principal deities of the Theban nome in a Late period Manual. This connection distinguishes her from the goddess Mut who in only associated with the Mut complex and the Isheru lake of the Mut Temple within the larger karnak temple complex 

Amunet appears most frequently alongisde ithyphallic forms of Amun such as Amenope or Amun-Min-kamutef and never appears in temple scenes together with Khonsu or any other child gods. Thus while Amun, Mut and Khonsu form the classic Theban triad, Amunet only accompanies Amun. In the Festival Hall of Thutmose III (c. 1479–1425 BC), Amunet is shown with the fertility god Min while leading a row of deities to visit the king in the anniversary celebration. Amunet is mythologically regarded as the mother-wife of Amun-Min, which is also indicated by his title “bull of his mother”. Inscriptions from Karnak describe the goddess as „the mother together with the father in the beginning“ and as the embodiment of the primordial Lotus which gave birth to the sun god. Amunet is also less frequently referred to as Amun&#x27;s daughter or sister-wife in Karnak.

In spite of Amunet&#x27;s stable position as a local goddess of Egypt&#x27;s most important city, her cult began to have very little following outside the Theban region that developed into a dominant religious center for the unified country.

Amunet was depicted as a woman wearing the Deshret &quot;Red Crown of Lower Egypt&quot; and carrying a staff of papyrus—as in her colossal statue placed during the reign of Tutankhamun (c. 1332–1323 BC) into the Record Hall of Thutmose III at Karnak. The reason for this iconography is uncertain. At that time, the cult of Amun was being restored after being displaced by worship of Aten during the reign of Akhenaten.

The Graeco-Roman texts emphasize the Ogdoad cosmogony, where Amun (the bull) and Amunet (the cow) are primordial creators, preceding and forming the Ogdoad, which consists of four bulls (Montus) and four cows (Raettawys). Amun and Amunet&#x27;s union symbolizes the creation of the sun, a key cosmogonic event. This is reflected in Amenope&#x27;s epithet, &quot;eldest of the primeval ones,&quot; and Amunet&#x27;s designation as &quot;the Great Cow that gave birth to Ra&quot;. The goddess Raet is a female doublet of the sun god Ra, with whom both Montu and Amun were associated. In the Leiden Papyrus, Amun is described as “the one who appeared as Ra from the one who created what is and what is not, the father of fathers, the mother of mothers, the bull of those four young women of the first time.” Amun here embodies the four male aspects of the Ogdoad, which at the same time also embody Ra and Montu, who are supposed to unite with the four goddesses. In a demotic papyrus by Abusir el Meleq (Berl. Pap. 13603), Ptah-Tatennen, who is regarded here as a god superior to the Ogdoad, commands that the eight gods should unite and pour their seed into the great lake of Hermopolis, whereupon the first sun god emerges from this union.

In one of the Theban creation myths described in the Song of the Primal Gods, Amun hatched for the first time from an invisible egg at the Lake of the Two Knives (a mythological place that the sun god passes every day) on the Primal Hill in Hermopolis with Amunet as his companion.

During the New kingdom period (since the 26th dynasty)Amun and Amaunet appear only outside of Thebes as members of the ogdoad while Theban traditions place them a generation above the Ogdoad and replace them with the twin pair Niau and Niaut. On some of Ptolemy Euergetes&#x27;s monuments at Thebes, on which the new pair of Niau and Niaut complete the number eight of the primordial gods, Amun and Amunet are equated with the pair of gods Nun and Naunet and are seen as the parents of the sun god Atum.

Although she remained a distinct deity as late as the Ptolemaic Kingdom (323–30 BC), in some late texts from Karnak Amunet was syncretized with Neith and she was carved suckling pharaoh Philip III of Macedon (323–317 BC) who appears as a divine child immediately after his own enthronement, onto an exterior wall of the eighteenth dynasty Festival Hall of Thutmose III at Karnak. Just like Neith, Amunet is called the „great cow who birthed Ra“, „mother of Ra“, „mother of light“ and &quot;mother of god“.

<text>Kek is the deification of the concept of primordial darkness in the ancient Egyptian Ogdoad cosmogony of Hermopolis.

The Ogdoad consisted of four pairs of deities, four male gods paired with their female counterparts. Kek&#x27;s female counterpart was Kauket. Kek and Kauket in some aspects also represent night and day, and were called &quot;raiser up of the light&quot; and the &quot;raiser up of the night&quot;, respectively.

The name is written as &quot;kk&quot; or &quot;kkwy&quot; with a variant of the sky hieroglyph in ligature with the staff (N2) associated with the word for &quot;darkness&quot; &quot;kkw&quot;.

==History==

In the oldest representations, &quot;Kauket&quot; is given the head of a serpent, and &quot;Kek&quot; the head of either a frog or a cat. In one scene, they are identified with Ka and Kait; in this scene, Ka-Kekui has the head of a frog surmounted by a beetle and Kait-Kekuit has the head of a serpent surmounted by a disk.

In the Greco-Roman period, Kek&#x27;s male form was depicted as a frog-headed man, and the female form as a serpent-headed woman, as were all four dualistic concepts in the Ogdoad.

==In popular culture==

Individuals associated with online message boards, such as 4chan, noted a similarity between Kek and the character Pepe the Frog. This was later paired with images of Pepe, resulting in a resurgence of interest in the ancient deity.

<text>Joseph John Lannin (April 23, 1866 – May 15, 1928) was a Canadian-born American baseball entrepreneur. He was the sole owner of the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball for most of the 1914 through 1916 seasons, during which the team won two World Series.

==Biography==
Lannin was born on April 23, 1866, in Lac-Beauport, Canada East to John Lannin and Catherine Evans. His parents were Irish immigrants. Orphaned at the age of 14, Lannin migrated from Quebec to Boston, Massachusetts, where he worked as a hotel bellboy. Penniless, he had remarkably made his way from Lac-Beauport to Boston on foot. He married Hannah Furlong and had two children, Paul Joseph Lannin and Dorothy A. Lannin.

Although he had limited education, Lannin was personable and possessed a quick mind. He soon learned about real estate and the commodities market by listening to conversations of the wealthy patrons at his hotel and taking advice from those who were willing to share their insights with him. A confident and knowledgeable Lannin invested his savings in the commodities market, making a small fortune. From there he began to acquire other businesses and eventually built an empire of hotels, apartment buildings, and golf courses.

On December 21, 1913, Lannin and a group of investors purchased 50% of the Boston Red Sox baseball team from Jimmy McAleer and Robert B. McRoy. In 1914, he became the sole owner of the Red Sox and in that same year he purchased the rights to bring Babe Ruth to Boston. The team went on to win the World Series in and .

Lannin sold the team in 1917 to Harry Frazee for $675,000. He was quoted as saying, &quot;I am too much of a fan to be an owner.&quot; With the profit made from the sale of his team, he continued to invest in real estate ventures all around Boston and across New York State.

Lannin acquired Roosevelt Airfield on Long Island, where Charles Lindbergh began his historic transatlantic flight. Lannin provided Lindbergh with a room at his nearby hotel and watched the takeoff from Roosevelt Airfield on May 20, 1927.

Lannin died on May 15, 1928, aged 62, in Brooklyn, having fallen or jumped from a window of a hotel that he owned; it was not known if he had a medical issue or died by suicide. At the time of his death, his estate was valued at $7,000,000. He is interred at the Cemetery of the Holy Rood, Garden City, New York.

Lannin was inducted to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 2004.

<doc id="97103" wikidata="Q2098" url="?curid=97103" title="Martial">
<text>Marcus Valerius Martialis (known in English as Martial ; March, between 38 and 41 AD – between 102 and 104 AD) was a Roman and Celtiberian poet born in Hispania (modern Spain) best known for his twelve books of &quot;Epigrams&quot;, published in Rome between AD 86 and 103, during the reigns of the emperors Domitian, Nerva and Trajan. In these poems he satirises city life and the scandalous activities of his acquaintances, and romanticises his provincial upbringing. He wrote a total of 1,561 epigrams, of which 1,235 are in elegiac couplets.

Martial has been called the greatest Latin epigrammatist, and is considered the creator of the modern epigram.

==Early life==
Knowledge of his origins and early life are derived almost entirely from his works, which can be more or less dated according to the well-known events to which they refer. In Book X of his &quot;Epigrams&quot;, composed between 95 and 98, he mentions celebrating his fifty-seventh birthday; hence he was born during March 38, 39, 40 or 41 AD (Mart. 10. 24. 1),
under Caligula or Claudius. 

Martial&#x27;s name seems to imply that he was born a Roman citizen. His place of birth was Augusta Bilbilis (now Calatayud) in Hispania Tarraconensis, an information he gives by speaking of himself as &quot;sprung from the Celts and Iberians, and a countryman of the Tagus&quot;. In contrasting his own masculine appearance with that of an effeminate Greek, he draws particular attention to &quot;his stiff Hispanian hair&quot; (Mart. 10. 65. 7). Several notable 1st century Latin writers were born in Roman Hispania, including Seneca the Elder and Seneca the Younger, Lucan and Quintilian, and Martial&#x27;s contemporaries Licinianus of Bilbilis, Decianus of Emerita and Canius of Gades. 

Martial&#x27;s parents, Fronto and Flaccilla, appear to have died in his youth. His home was evidently one of rude comfort and plenty, sufficiently in the country to afford him the amusements of hunting and fishing, which he often recalls with keen pleasure, and sufficiently near the town to afford him the companionship of many comrades, the few survivors of whom he looks forward to meeting again after his thirty-four years&#x27; absence (Mart. 10. 104). The memories of this old home, and of other spots, the rough names and local associations which he delights to introduce into his verse, attest to the simple pleasures of his early life and were among the influences which kept his spirit alive in the stultifying routines of upper-crust social life in Rome.

Martial professes to be of the school of Catullus, Pedo, and Marsus. The epigram bears to this day the form impressed upon it by his unrivalled skill in wordsmithing.

==Life in Rome==
The success of his countrymen may have been what motivated Martial to move to Rome, from Hispania, once he had completed his education. This move occurred in AD 64. Seneca the Younger and Lucan may have served as his first patrons, but this is not known for sure.

Not much is known of the details of his life for the first twenty years or so after he came to Rome. He published some juvenile poems of which he thought very little in his later years, and he chuckles at a foolish bookseller who would not allow them to die a natural death (Mart. 1. 113). His faculty ripened with experience and with the knowledge of that social life which was both his theme and his inspiration; many of his best epigrams are among those written in his last years. From many answers which he makes to the remonstrances of friends—among others to those of Quintilian—it may be inferred that he was urged to practice at the bar, but that he preferred his own lazy, some would say Bohemian kind of life. He made many influential friends and patrons and secured the favor of both Titus and Domitian. From them he obtained various privileges, among others the &quot;semestris tribunatus&quot;, which conferred on him equestrian rank. Martial failed, however, in his application to Domitian for more substantial advantages, although he commemorates the glory of having been invited to dinner by him, and also the fact that he procured the privilege of citizenship for many persons on whose behalf he appealed to him.

The earliest of his extant works, known as &quot;Liber spectaculorum&quot;, was first published at the opening of the Colosseum in the reign of Titus. It relates to the theatrical performances given by him, but the book as it now stands was published about the first year of Domitian, i.e. about the year 81. The favour of the emperor procured him the countenance of some of the worst creatures at the imperial court—among them of the notorious Crispinus, and probably of Paris, the supposed author of Juvenal&#x27;s exile, for whose monument Martial afterwards wrote a eulogistic epitaph. The two books, numbered by editors XIII and XIV, known by the names of &quot;Xenia&quot; and &quot;Apophoreta&quot;—inscriptions in two lines each for presents—were published at the Saturnalia of 84. In 86 he produced the first two of the twelve books on which his reputation rests.

From that time till his return to Hispania in 98 he published a volume almost every year. The first nine books and the first edition of Book X appeared in the reign of Domitian; Book XI. appeared at the end of 96, shortly after the accession of Nerva. A revised edition of book X, that which we now possess, appeared in 98, about the time of Trajan&#x27;s entrance into Rome. The last book was written after three years&#x27; absence in Hispania, shortly before his death about the year 102 or 103.

These twelve books bring Martial&#x27;s ordinary mode of life between the age of forty-five and sixty before us. His regular home for thirty-five years was the bustle of metropolitan Rome. He lived at first up three flights of stairs, and his &quot;garret&quot; overlooked the laurels in front of the portico of Agrippa. He had a small villa and unproductive farm near Nomentum, in the Sabine territory, to which he occasionally retired from the pestilence, boors and noises of the city (Mart. 2. 38, Mart. 7. 57). In his later years he had also a small house on the Quirinal, near the temple of Quirinus.

At the time when his third book was brought out he had retired for a short time to Cisalpine Gaul, in weariness, as he tells us, of his unprofitable attendance on the bigwigs of Rome. For a time he seems to have felt the charm of the new scenes which he visited, and in a later book (Mart 4. 25) he contemplates the prospect of retiring to the neighbourhood of Aquileia and the Timavus. But the spell exercised over him by Rome and Roman society was too great; even the epigrams sent from Forum Corneli and the Aemilian Way ring much more of the Roman forum, and of the streets, baths, porticos, brothels, market stalls, public houses, and clubs of Rome, than of the places from which they are dated.

His final departure from Rome was motivated by a weariness of the burdens imposed on him by his social position, and apparently the difficulties of meeting the ordinary expenses of living in the metropolis (Mart. 10. 96); and he looks forward to a return to the scenes familiar to his youth. The well-known epigram addressed to Juvenal (Mart. 12. 18) shows that for a time his ideal was happily realized; but the evidence of the prose epistle prefixed to Book XII proves and that he could not live happily away from the literary and social pleasures of Rome for long. The one consolation of his exile was a lady, Marcella, of whom he writes rather platonically as if she were his patroness—and it seems to have been a necessity of his life to always have a patron or patroness— rather than his wife or mistress.

During his life at Rome, although he never rose to a position of real independence, he seems to have known many writers of the time. In addition to Lucan and Quintilian, he numbered among his friends Silius Italicus, Juvenal and Pliny the Younger. Despite the two authors writing at the same time and having common friends, Martial and Statius are largely silent about one another, which may be explained by mutual dislike. Martial in many places shows an undisguised contempt for the artificial kind of epic on which Statius&#x27;s reputation chiefly rests; and it is possible that the respectable author of the &quot;Thebaid&quot; and the &quot;Silvae&quot; felt little admiration for the life or the works of the bohemian epigrammatist.

==Martial and his patrons==
Martial was dependent on his wealthy friends and patrons for gifts of money, for his dinner, and even for his dress, but the relation of client to patron had been recognized as an honourable one by the best Roman traditions. No blame was attached to Virgil or Horace on account of the favours which they received from Augustus and Maecenas, or of the return which they made for these favours in their verse. That old honourable relationship, however, greatly changed during the time that passed between Augustus and Domitian. Men of good birth and education, and sometimes even of high official position (Juv. 1. 117), accepted the dole (&quot;sportula&quot;). Martial was merely following a general fashion in paying his court to &quot;a lord,&quot; and he made the best of the custom. In his earlier career he used to accompany his patrons to their villas at Baiae or Tibur, and to attend their morning levees. Later on, he went to his own small country house, near Nomentum, and sent a poem, or a small volume of his poems, as his representative at the early visit.

==Martial&#x27;s character==
Pliny the Younger, in the short tribute which he pays to him on hearing of his death, wrote, &quot;He had as much good-nature as wit and pungency in his writings&quot;. Martial professes to avoid personalities in his satire, and honour and sincerity (&quot;fides&quot; and &quot;simplicitas&quot;) seem to have been the qualities which he most admires in his friends. Some have found distasteful his apparent servile flattery to the worst of the many bad emperors of Rome in the 1st century. These were emperors Martial would later censure immediately after their death (Mart. 12. 6). However, he seems to have disliked hypocrisy in its many forms, and seems to be free from cant, pedantry, or affectation of any kind.

Though many of his epigrams indicate a cynical disbelief in the female character, yet others prove that he could respect and almost revere a refined and courteous woman. His own life in Rome afforded him no experience of domestic virtue; but his epigrams show that, even in the age which is known to modern readers chiefly from the &quot;Satires&quot; of Juvenal, virtue was recognized as the purest source of happiness. The tenderest element in Martial&#x27;s nature seems, however, to have been his affection for children and for his dependents.

==Martial&#x27;s &quot;Epigrams&quot;==

Martial&#x27;s keen curiosity and power of observation are manifested in his epigrams. The enduring literary interest of Martial&#x27;s epigrams arises as much from their literary quality as from the colorful references to human life that they contain. Martial&#x27;s epigrams bring to life the spectacle and brutality of daily life in imperial Rome, with which he was intimately connected.

From Martial, for example, we have a glimpse of his living conditions in the city of Rome:

As Jo-Ann Shelton has written, &quot;fire was a constant threat in ancient cities because wood was a common building material and people often used open fires and oil lamps. However, some people may have deliberately set fire to their property in order to collect insurance money.&quot; Martial makes this accusation in one of his epigrams:

Martial also pours scorn on the doctors of his day:

Martial&#x27;s epigrams also refer to the cruelty shown to slaves in Roman society. Below, he chides a man named Rufus for flogging his cook for a minor mistake:

Martial&#x27;s epigrams are also characterized by their biting and often scathing sense of wit as well as for their lewdness; this has earned him a place in literary history as the original insult comic. Below is a sample of his more insulting work:



Or the following two examples (in translations by Mark Ynys-Mon):

Along with Roman graffiti, the Epigrams are important sources for Latin obscene words.

==Reception==
The works of Martial became highly valued on their discovery by the Renaissance, whose writers often saw them as sharing an eye for the urban vices of their own times. The poet&#x27;s influence is seen in Juvenal, late classical literature, the Carolingian revival, the Renaissance in France and Italy, the Siglo de Oro, and early modern English and German poetry, until he became unfashionable with the growth of the Romantic movement.

The 21st century has seen a resurgence of scholarly attention to Martial&#x27;s work.

<text>George Robert Acworth Conquest (15 July 19173 August 2015) was a British and American historian, poet, and novelist. He was briefly a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain but later wrote several books against communism. 

A long-time research fellow at Stanford University&#x27;s Hoover Institution, Conquest was most notable for his work on the Soviet Union. His books included &quot;The Great Terror: Stalin&#x27;s Purges of the 1930s&quot; (1968); &quot;The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivisation and the Terror-Famine&quot; (1986); and &quot;&quot; (1991). He was also the author of two novels and several collections of poetry.

==Early life and education==
Conquest was born in Great Malvern, Worcestershire, to an American father, Robert Folger Wescott Conquest, and an English mother, Rosamund Alys Acworth. His father served in an American Ambulance Field Service unit with the French Army in World War I, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre, with Silver Star in 1916.

Conquest was educated at Winchester College, where he won an exhibition to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Magdalen College, Oxford. He took a gap year, spending time at the University of Grenoble and in Bulgaria, and returning to Oxford in 1937, where he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain and the Carlton Club. He was awarded an MA in PPE and a DLitt in history.

==Career==
===War years===
In Lisbon on an American passport at the outbreak of the Second World War, Conquest returned to England. As the Communist Party of Great Britain denounced the war in 1939 as imperialist and capitalist, Conquest broke with it and was commissioned into the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry on 20 April 1940, serving with the regiment until 1946.

In 1943 he was posted to the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (later part of University College London) to study Bulgarian. The following year he was posted to Bulgaria as a liaison officer to the Bulgarian forces fighting under Soviet command, attached to the Third Ukrainian Front, then to the Allied Control Commission. At the end of the war, he joined the Foreign Office, returning to the British Legation in Sofia where he remained as the press officer. In 1948 he left Bulgaria when he was recalled to London under a minor diplomatic cloud after he had helped smuggle two Bulgarians out of the country.

===Information Research Department===
In 1948 Conquest joined the Foreign Office&#x27;s Information Research Department (IRD), a &quot;propaganda counter-offensive&quot; unit created by the Labour Attlee government in order to &quot;collect and summarize reliable information about Soviet and communist misdoings, to disseminate it to democratic journalists, politicians, and trade unionists, and to support, financially and otherwise, anticommunist publications.&quot; The IRD was also engaged in manipulating public opinion. Conquest was remembered there as a &quot;brilliant, arrogant&quot; figure who had 10 people reporting to him. He continued to work at the Foreign Office until 1956, becoming increasingly involved in the intellectual counter-offensive against communism.

In 1949 Conquest&#x27;s assistant, Celia Kirwan (later Celia Goodman), approached George Orwell for information to help identify Soviet sympathisers. Orwell&#x27;s list, discovered after her death in 2002, included &quot;Guardian&quot; and &quot;Observer&quot; journalists, as well as E. H. Carr and Charlie Chaplin. Conquest, like Orwell, fell for the beautiful Celia Kirwan, who inspired him to write several poems. One of his foreign office colleagues was Alan Maclean, brother of Donald Maclean, one of the Philby spy ring, who fled to Russia with Guy Burgess in 1951. When his brother defected, Alan resigned, then went to Macmillan and published a book of Conquest&#x27;s poems. At the Foreign Office, Conquest wrote several papers that sowed the seeds for his later work. One, on the Soviet means of obtaining confessions, was elaborated on in &quot;The Great Terror&quot;. Other papers were &quot;Peaceful Co-existence in Soviet Propaganda and Theory&quot;, and &quot;United Fronts – a Communist Tactic&quot;. In 1950 Conquest served briefly as First Secretary in the British Delegation to the United Nations.

===Writing===
In 1956 Conquest left the Foreign Office and became a freelance writer and historian. After he left, he says, the Information Research Department (IRD) suggested to him that he could combine some of the data he had gathered from Soviet publications into a book. During the 1960s he edited eight volumes of work produced by the IRD, published in London by the Bodley Head as the Soviet Studies Series. Many of his Foreign Office works were published this way. In the United States, the material was republished as The Contemporary Soviet Union Series by Frederick Praeger, who had previously published several books on communism at the request of the CIA, in addition to works by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Milovan Đilas, Howard Fast, and Charles Patrick Fitzgerald. 

In 1962–1963 Conquest was literary editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot;, but he resigned when he found the job interfering with his historical writing. His first books on the Soviet Union were &quot;Common Sense About Russia&quot; (1960), &quot;The Soviet Deportation of Nationalities&quot; (1960) and &quot;Power and Policy in the USSR&quot; (1961). His other early works on the Soviet Union included &quot;Courage of Genius: The Pasternak Affair&quot; (1961) and &quot;Russia After Khrushchev&quot; (1965).

==Historical works==
===&quot;The Great Terror&quot; (1968)===

In 1968 Conquest published what became his best-known work, &quot;The Great Terror: Stalin&#x27;s Purge of the Thirties&quot;, the first comprehensive research of the Great Purge, which took place in the Soviet Union between 1936 and 1938. Many reviewers at the time were not impressed by his way of writing about the Great Terror, which was in the tradition of &quot;great men who make history&quot;. The book was based mainly on information which had been made public, either officially or by individuals, during the so-called &quot;Khrushchev Thaw&quot; in the period 1956–64. It also drew on accounts by Russian and Ukrainian émigrés and exiles dating back to the 1930s, and on an analysis of official Soviet documents such as the Soviet census.

The most important aspect of the book was that it widened the understanding of the purges beyond the previous narrow focus on the &quot;Moscow trials&quot; of disgraced Communist Party of the Soviet Union leaders such as Nikolai Bukharin and Grigory Zinoviev, who were executed shortly thereafter. The question of why these leaders had pleaded guilty and confessed to various crimes at the trials had become a topic of discussion for a number of western writers, and helped inspire anti-Communist tracts such as George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; and Arthur Koestler&#x27;s &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot;.

Conquest argued that the trials and executions of these former Communist leaders were a minor detail of the purges. By his estimates, Stalinist purges had led to the deaths of some 20 million people. He later stated that the total number of deaths could &quot;hardly be lower than some thirteen to fifteen million.&quot;

Conquest sharply criticized Western intellectuals such as Beatrice and Sidney Webb, George Bernard Shaw, Jean-Paul Sartre, Walter Duranty, Sir Bernard Pares, Harold Laski, D. N. Pritt, Theodore Dreiser, Bertolt Brecht, Owen Lattimore, and Romain Rolland, as well as American ambassador Joseph Davies, accusing them of being dupes of Stalin and apologists of his regime. Conquest cites various comments made by them where, he argues, they were denying, excusing, or justifying various aspects of the purges.

After the opening up of the Soviet archives, detailed information was released that Conquest argued supported his conclusions. When Conquest&#x27;s publisher asked him to expand and revise &quot;The Great Terror&quot;, Conquest is famously said to have suggested the new version of the book be titled &quot;I Told You So, You Fucking Fools.&quot; In fact, the mock title was jokingly proposed by Conquest&#x27;s old friend, Sir Kingsley Amis. The new version was published in 1990 as &quot;The Great Terror: A Reassessment&quot;; . The American historian J. Arch Getty disagreed, writing in 1993 that the archives did not support Conquest&#x27;s casualty figures. In 1995, investigative journalist Paul Lashmar suggested that the reputation of prominent academics such as Robert Conquest was built upon work derived from material provided by the IRD.
According to Denis Healey &quot;The Great Terror&quot; was an important influence, &quot;but one which confirmed people in their views rather than converted them&quot;.

Many aspects of his book continue to be disputed by sovietologist historians and researchers on Russian and Soviet history, such as Stephen G. Wheatcroft, who insists that Conquest&#x27;s victim totals for Stalinist repressions are too high, even in his reassessments. In 2000, Michael Ignatieff, whose family had emigrated from Russia as a result of the Bolshevik Revolution, wrote &quot;One of the few unalloyed pleasures of old age is living long enough to see yourself vindicated. Robert Conquest is currently enjoying this pleasure.&quot; Conservative historian Paul Johnson, one of Thatcher&#x27;s closest advisers, described Conquest as &quot;our greatest living historian&quot;. And, in the phrase of Timothy Garton Ash, he was Solzhenitsyn before Solzhenitsyn.

In 1996 Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, who had been previously attacked by Conquest for his book &quot;Age of Extremes&quot;, praised Conquest&#x27;s &quot;The Great Terror&quot; &quot;as a remarkable pioneer effort to assess the Stalin Terror&quot;. However he expressed the view that this work and others were now to be considered obsolete &quot;simply because the archival sources are now available&quot;. As a result, he wrote, there was no need for &quot;fragmentary sources&quot; and &quot;guesswork&quot;. &quot;[W]hen better or more complete data are available, they must take the place of poor and incomplete ones.&quot; In 2002 Conquest replied to his revisionist critics: &quot;&quot;They&#x27;re still talking absolute balls. In the academy, there remains a feeling of, &quot;Don&#x27;t let&#x27;s be too rude to Stalin. He was a bad guy, yes, but the Americans were bad guys too, and so was the British Empire.&quot;&quot;

===&quot;The Harvest of Sorrow&quot; (1986)===

In 1986 Conquest published &quot;The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivisation and the Terror-Famine&quot;, dealing with the collectivization of agriculture in Ukraine and elsewhere in the USSR, under Stalin&#x27;s direction in 1929–31, and the resulting famine, in which millions of peasants died due to starvation, deportation to labor camps, and execution. In this book, Conquest supported the view that the famine was a planned act of genocide. According to historians Stephen Wheatcroft and R. W. Davies, &quot;Conquest holds that Stalin wanted the famine... and that the Ukrainian famine was deliberately inflicted for its own sake.&quot; Nevertheless, he wrote to them in a letter in 2003 that &quot;Stalin purposely inflicted the 1933 famine? No. What I argue is that with resulting famine imminent, he could have prevented it, but put &#x27;Soviet interest&#x27; other than feeding the starving first thus consciously abetting it.&quot;

===&quot;Stalin and the Kirov Murder&quot; (1989)===
For the Trotskyists, Kirov&#x27;s murder was the Stalinist equivalent of the Reichstag fire, deliberately started by the Nazis to justify the arrest of German Communists. The Trotskyist-Menshevik view became the dominant one among western historians, popularised in Robert Conquest&#x27;s influential books.

In &quot;The Great Terror&quot;, Conquest already undermined the official Soviet story of conspiracy and treason. Conquest placed the murder in 1934 of the Leningrad party boss, Sergei Kirov, one of Stalin&#x27;s inner circle, as the key to the mechanism of terror.

He returned to this in &quot;Stalin and the Kirov Murder&quot; (1989), where he argued that Stalin not only sanctioned Kirov&#x27;s assassination, but used it as a justification for the terror that culminated in 1937–38, though no evidence has been found to confirm Stalin&#x27;s role in the murder.

==Poetry and literature==
===Poems===
In addition to his scholarly work, Conquest was a well-regarded poet whose poems have been published in various periodicals from 1937. In 1945 he was awarded the PEN Brazil Prize for his war poem &quot;For the Death of a Poet&quot; – about an army friend, the poet Drummond Allison, killed in Italy – and, in 1951, he received a Festival of Britain verse prize. During his lifetime, he had seven volumes of poetry and one of literary criticism published.

Conquest was a major figure in a prominent British literary circle known as &quot;The Movement&quot; which also included Philip Larkin and Kingsley Amis. Movement poets, many of whom bristled at being so labeled, rejected the experiments of earlier practitioners such as Ezra Pound.

He edited, in 1956 and 1962, the influential &quot;New Lines&quot; anthologies, introducing works by them, as well as Thom Gunn, Dennis Enright, and others, to a wider public. He spent 1959–60 as visiting poet at the University of Buffalo. Several of his poems were published in &quot;The New Oxford Book of Light Verse&quot; (1978; compiled by Amis), under the pseudonyms &quot;Stuart Howard-Jones&quot;, &quot;Victor Gray&quot; and &quot;Ted Pauker&quot;.

It emerged from the pages of poet Philip Larkin&#x27;s published letters that Conquest and Larkin shared an enthusiasm for pornography in the 1950s. When Larkin was in Hull, Conquest sent him judicious selections of the latest pornography, and, when he came down to London, Conquest took him on shopping trips to the Soho porn shops. On one occasion Conquest, in 1957, wrote a letter to Larkin purporting to come from the Vice Squad which had found the poet&#x27;s name on a pornographic publisher&#x27;s list. Larkin panicked and went to see his solicitor, convinced that he was going to lose his job as librarian at Hull University, before Conquest owned up. The true story of the joke became in 2008, &quot;Mr Larkin&#x27;s Awkward Day&quot;, a comedy radio play by Chris Harrald.

Soon after his expulsion from the Soviet Union, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn met with Conquest, asking him to translate a &#x27;little&#x27; poem of his into English verse. This was &quot;Prussian Nights&quot; – nearly two thousand lines in ballad metre – published in 1977.

A new &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, edited by Elizabeth Conquest, was published in March 2020 by the Waywiser Press.

===Novels===
Conquest had been a member of the British Interplanetary Society since the 1940s, and shared Amis&#x27;s taste for science fiction. Starting from 1961, the two writers jointly edited &quot;Spectrum&quot;, five anthologies of new sci-fi writing. Conquest also proposed to Amis a collaboration based on a draft comic novel that Conquest had completed. This was revised by Amis, then it appeared under both their names as &quot;The Egyptologists&quot; (1965). The novel is about a secret Egyptological London society that is really a husbands&#x27; organization serving as an alibi for philanderers. A reviewer in &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that their &quot;elaborate little jokes leave an unpleasant taste&quot;.

Later a film version of the novel was cancelled when its star, Peter Sellers, was called away to Hollywood. Conquest published a science-fiction novel, &quot;A World of Difference&quot; (1955).

==Political works==
===&quot;What to Do When the Russians Come&quot; (1984)===
In 1984, Robert Conquest wrote, with Jon Manchip White, the fictional book &quot;What to Do When the Russians Come: a Survivor&#x27;s Guide&quot; which, however, was intended to be a real survival manual in case of Soviet invasion. This book, as many other works of the mid-1980s in different media, like Sir John Hackett&#x27;s &quot;The Third World War&quot;, the movie &quot;Red Dawn&quot;, and the Milton Bradley game &quot;Fortress America&quot;, starts from the premise that a Soviet ground-invasion of the United States could be imminent and that the Soviet Union was about to engulf the world.

It is widely accepted that the United States now faces a real possibility of succumbing to the power of an alien regime unless the right policies are pursued. [This book&#x27;s aim] is, first, to show the American citizen clearly and factually what the results of this possible Soviet domination could be and how it would affect him or her personally; and second, to give some serious advice on how to survive.&quot;

Conquest supported the Reagan defense buildup and asked for an increase of expenses on US defense budget, claiming that in the nuclear field NATO was only possibly matching USSR military power:

We live in dangerous times. Such miscalculations are very possible. But they are not inevitable. The American people and their representatives have it in their power to prevent their country from undergoing the ordeal we have described. A democratic government, with all its distractions and disadvantages, ... It is not infallible, it is slow to learn, and it is willing to grasp at comfortable illusions; but it may yet act decisively&quot;

&quot;But why should we fear that such an ordeal may face us? The economic potential of the West in gross national product is far greater than that of the Soviet Union...In fact, the Soviet Union is economically far behind the United States. American technology is always a generation ahead of theirs. They have to turn to the United States for wheat. The Soviet economy is at a dead end. The Communist system has failed to win support in any of the countries of Eastern Europe. The Soviet idea has no attractions. On any calculation—of economic power or social advance or intellectual progress there could be no question of the Russians imposing their will. But in terms of actual military power, the West&#x27;s advantage does not seem to have been made use of. It is at least matched, and many would say overmatched, in the nuclear field; the Western forces in Europe have less than half the striking power of their opponents. It is no good our being more advanced than they are if this is not translated into power—both military power and political willpower.&quot;

In 1986 Conquest affirmed that &quot;a science-fiction attitude is a great help in understanding the Soviet Union. It isn&#x27;t so much whether they&#x27;re good or bad, exactly; they&#x27;re not bad or good as we&#x27;d be bad or good. It&#x27;s far better to look at them as Martians than as people like us.&quot;

===&quot;Reflections on a Ravaged Century&quot; (1999)===
&quot;Reflections on a Ravaged Century&quot; is a book devoted to the psychological roots of fanaticism, in which Conquest argues that Communism and Nazism were equal and more twins than opposites.

There is much more in this book about communism than Nazism, partly because of Conquest&#x27;s greater expertise on communism, and partly because comparatively few Western intellectuals became Nazis. He focuses mainly on attacks on intellectuals in the West who became communists because they felt or believed that this was &quot;anti-fascism&quot; or &quot;anti-Nazism&quot;.

===Laws of politics===
Conquest posited two laws of politics, apparently not referenced in any of his books but as observations he made in conversations:
# Generally speaking, everybody is reactionary on subjects he knows about.
# Every organisation appears to be headed by secret agents of its opponents.

Conquest&#x27;s first and second law are attested by at least two sources. On 14 February 2003, Andrew Brown wrote of Conquest&#x27;s campaign against the expansion of university education that &quot;[f]rom this period dates &#x27;Conquest&#x27;s Law&#x27;, which states that &#x27;Everyone is a reactionary about subjects he understands&#x27;. This was later supplemented with the balancing rule that every organisation behaves as if it is run by secret agents of its opponents.&quot; In his 1991 &quot;Memoirs&quot;, Kingsley Amis wrote of Conquest that &quot;he was to point out that, while very &#x27;progressive&#x27; on the subject of colonialism and other matters I was ignorant of, I was a sound reactionary about education, of which I had some understanding and experience. From my own and others&#x27; example he formulated his famous First Law, which runs, &#x27;Generally speaking, everybody is reactionary on subjects he knows about.&#x27; (The Second Law, more recent, says, &#x27;Every organisation appears to be headed by secret agents of its opponents.&#x27;)&quot;

On 25 June 2003, John Derbyshire wrote in the &quot;National Review Online&quot;″s blog &quot;The Corner&quot; that &quot;[a]s best I can remember&quot;, Conquest conjectured three laws of politics:
# Everyone is conservative about what he knows best.
# Any organization not explicitly right-wing sooner or later becomes left-wing.
# The simplest way to explain the behavior of any bureaucratic organization is to assume that it is controlled by a cabal of its enemies.

Derbyshire commented: &quot;Of the Second Law, Conquest gave the Church of England and Amnesty International as examples. Of the third, he noted that a bureaucracy sometimes actually &quot;IS&quot; controlled by a secret cabal of its enemies – e.g. the postwar British secret service.&quot; For these statements, Conquest would become well known among certain thinkers, especially online conservatives; however, Derbyshire cited no source for them and implied his memory was not certain on the matter. Indeed, the second law given here is O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s first law, which was stated by John O&#x27;Sullivan in his article &quot;O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s First Law&quot; in the 27 October 1989 print issue of the &quot;National Review&quot;, in which he also references Derbyshire&#x27;s Conquest&#x27;s third law as Conquest&#x27;s second law:
==Personal life==
Conquest was married four times, first in 1942 to Joan Watkins, with whom he had two sons. They divorced in 1948. There followed a marriage to Tatiana Mihailova (1948–1962), whom he had helped escape from Bulgaria. She was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1951. In 1962 he married Caroleen MacFarlane; they divorced in 1978. That year he began dating Elizabeth Neece Wingate, a lecturer in English and the daughter of a United States Air Force colonel. He and Wingate married in 1979. When he died in 2015, he had several grandchildren from his sons and stepdaughter.

==Later life==
In 1981 Conquest moved to California to take up a post as Senior Research Fellow and Scholar-Curator of the Russian and Commonwealth of Independent States Collection at Stanford University&#x27;s Hoover Institution, where he remained a Fellow. In 1985 he signed a petition in support of the anti-Communist Contras (Nicaragua). He was a fellow of the Columbia University&#x27;s Russian Institute, and of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars; a distinguished visiting scholar at The Heritage Foundation; a research associate of Harvard University&#x27;s Ukrainian Research Institute. In 1990 he presented &quot;Red Empire&quot;, a seven-part mini-series on the Soviet Union produced by Yorkshire Television.

Conquest died in 2015 in Stanford, California, at the age of 98, of respiratory failure as a result of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<text>Min (), also called Menas, is an ancient Egyptian god whose cult originated in the predynastic period (4th millennium BCE). He was represented in many different forms, but was most often represented in male human form, shown with an erect penis which he holds in his left hand and an upheld right arm holding a flail.

== Myths and function ==

Min&#x27;s cult began and was centered around Coptos (Koptos, modern day Qift) and Akhmim (Panopolis) of Upper Egypt, where in his honour great festivals were held celebrating his &quot;coming forth&quot; with a public procession and presentation of offerings. His other associations include the eastern desert and links to the god Horus. Flinders Petrie excavated two large statues of Min at Qift which are now in the Ashmolean Museum and it is thought by some that they are pre-dynastic. Although not mentioned by name, a reference to &quot;he whose arm is raised in the East&quot; in the Pyramid Texts is thought to refer to Min.

His importance grew in the Middle Kingdom when he became even more closely linked with Horus as the deity Min-Horus. By the New Kingdom he was also fused with Amun in the form of Min-Amun, who was also the serpent Irta, a &quot;kamutef&quot; (the &quot;bull of his mother&quot; - a god who fathers himself with his own mother. The kamutf name is also used in reference to Horus-Min). Min as an independent deity was also a &quot;kamutef&quot; of Isis. One of Isis&#x27;s many places of cult throughout the valley was at Min&#x27;s temple in Koptos as his divine wife. Min&#x27;s shrine was crowned with a pair of bull horns.

As the central deity of fertility and possibly orgiastic rites, Min became identified by the Greeks with the god Pan. One feature of Min worship was the wild prickly lettuce &quot;Lactuca serriola&quot; – the domestic version of which is &quot;Lactuca sativa&quot; (lettuce) – which has aphrodisiac and opiate qualities and produces latex when cut, possibly identified with semen. He also had connections with Nubia. However, his main centers of worship remained at Coptos and Akhmim (Khemmis).


Male deities as vehicles for fertility and potency rose to prevalence at the emergence of widespread agriculture. Male Egyptians would work in agriculture, making bountiful harvests a male-centered occasion. Thus, male gods of virility such as Osiris and Min were more developed during this time. Fertility was not associated with solely women, but with men as well, even increasing the role of the male in childbirth. As a god of male sexual potency, he was honoured during the coronation rites of the New Kingdom, when the Pharaoh was expected to sow his seed—generally thought to have been plant seeds. At the beginning of the harvest season, his image was taken out of the temple and brought to the fields in the &quot;festival of the departure of Min&quot;, the Min Festival, when they blessed the harvest, and played games naked in his honour, the most important of these being the climbing of a huge (tent) pole. This four day festival is evident from the great festivals list at the temple of Ramses III at Medinet Habu.

Cult and worship in the predynastic period surrounding a fertility god was based upon the fetish of fossilized belemnite. Later symbols widely used were the white bull, a barbed arrow, and a bed of lettuce, that the Egyptians believed to be an aphrodisiac. Egyptian lettuce was tall, straight, and released a milk-like sap when rubbed, characteristics superficially similar to the penis. Lettuce was sacrificially offered to the god, then eaten by men in an effort to achieve potency. Later pharaohs would offer the first fruits of harvest to the god to ensure plentiful harvest, with records of offerings of the first stems of sprouts of wheat being offered during the Ptolemaic period.

Civilians who were not able to formally practice the cult of Min paid homage to the god as sterility was an unfavorable condition looked upon with sorrow. Concubine figurines, ithyphallic statuettes, and ex-voto phalluses were placed at entrances to the houses of Deir el-Medina to honor the god in hopes of curing the disability. Egyptian women would touch the penises of statues of Min in hopes of pregnancy, a practice still continued today.

== Appearance ==
In Egyptian art, Min is depicted as an anthropomorphic male deity with a masculine body, covered in shrouds, wearing a crown with feathers, and often holding his erect penis in his left hand and a &quot;flail&quot; that is possibly a stylised form of flail (referring to his authority, or rather that of the Pharaohs) in his upward facing right hand. Around his forehead, Min wears a red ribbon that trails to the ground, claimed by some to represent sexual energy. The legs are bandaged because of his chthonic force, in the same manner as Ptah and Osiris. His skin was usually painted black, which symbolized the fertile soil of the Nile.

== Family ==
In &quot;Hymn to Min&quot; it is said:

Min, Lord of the Processions, God of the High Plumes, Son of Osiris and Isis, Venerated in Ipu...

... Min, Lord of the Processions,
God of the High Plumes,
Son of Osiris and Isis,
venerated in Ipu,
Gebtu&#x27;s Horus of the Strong Arm.

-- Hymn to Min

Min&#x27;s wives were Iabet and Repyt (Repit).

Isis is the mother of Min as well as his wife.

==Ejaculation legend==
There have been controversial suggestions, by authors such as British journalist Jonathan Margolis, that the pharaoh was expected to demonstrate, as part of a Min festival, that he could ejaculate—and thus ensure the annual flooding of the Nile. No hard evidence of this exists, according to Egyptologists Kara Cooney, professor of ancient Egyptian art and architecture at UCLA, and her colleague Jonathan Winnerman. This myth may have originated from a misinterpretation of a different festival.

<doc id="97106" wikidata="Q29409" url="?curid=97106" title="Mut">
<text>Mut (; also transliterated as Maut and Mout) was a mother goddess worshipped in ancient Egypt. Her name means &quot;mother&quot; in the ancient Egyptian language. Mut had many different aspects and attributes that changed and evolved greatly over the thousands of years of ancient Egyptian culture.

Mut was considered a primal deity, associated with the primordial waters of Nu from which everything in the world was born. Mut was sometimes said to have given birth to the world through parthenogenesis, but more often she was said to have a husband, the solar creator god Amun-Ra. Although Mut was believed by her followers to be the mother of everything in the world, she was particularly associated as the mother of the lunar child god Khonsu. At the Temple of Karnak in Egypt&#x27;s capital city of Thebes, the family of Amun-Ra, Mut and Khonsu were worshipped together as the Theban Triad.

In art, Mut was usually depicted as a woman wearing the double crown of the kings of Egypt, representing her power over the whole of the land.

During the high point of Mut&#x27;s cult, the rulers of Egypt would support her worship in their own way to emphasize their own authority and right to rule through an association with Mut. Mut was involved in many ancient Egyptian festivals such as the Opet Festival and the Beautiful Festival of the Valley.

==Mythology==

===Theban cosmogony===
In Theban creation myths, Mut is depicted as a serpent, who emerged from the primordial waters alongside her father the dt-serpent, a form of Amun-Ra. She embodies the Uraeus crown of the first god and uses her eyes to illuminate the world. She also embodies the stem of the primordial lotus blossom. 
Amun sometimes appears in two distinct forms: Kematef, the first creator and father of Mut, and Amun-Irta, who is described as being Kematefs Ba, son, and heir. 
===Role in the Theban triad===
Mut did not originate as the wife of Amun. She appears as an independant goddess also outside Thebes and had her own temples and priesthood. Studies on the origins of Amun in Karnak suggest that elements of Min’s theology were incorporated into Amun’s divine identity, including a family structure consisting of a male deity (Min), a female counterpart (Mut-Min), and a son (Min-Hor-Nacht). the Seventeenth Dynasty rulers showed interest in Coptos and its deity Min, restoring his temple and launching expeditions from the region. While Amun’s association with Ra began under Senusret I, the integration of Min’s theological aspects likely occurred between the Seventeenth and early Eighteenth Dynasty as part of the broader efforts to solidify religious and political legitimacy. While Min’s iconography was adopted in the Eleventh Dynasty, the integration of Mut-Min as Amun-Ra’s consort likely occurred later, no earlier than the Seventeenth Dynasty.

Mut was the consort of Amun, the patron deity of pharaohs during the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BC) and New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BC). Amaunet and Wosret may have been Amun&#x27;s consorts early in Egyptian history, but Mut, who did not appear in texts or art until the late Middle Kingdom, displaced them. The first documented depiction of Amun, Mut and Khonsu as a triad dates from the reign of queen Hatshepsut. 

Mut and Khonsu each have their own separate sanctuaries, distinct from Amun’s. Although they are often depicted together with Amun in his temple or elsewhere, they are rarely directly associated with his name. Mut is referred to as “the one residing in Ipet-sut” or “Lady of Ipet-sut,” while Khonsu is called “the one residing in Karnak” or “Lord of Karnak.” However, Mut is primarily known as “Lady of Isheru,” and Khonsu remains “Khonsu of Thebes,” even when linked to Ipet-sut. This suggests that their connection to Amun was secondary and relatively loose, despite appearing as a fixed divine family when the Amun cult spread to Nubia, the oases, and other regions.

Amun and Khonsu are often depicted as father and son, but were also viewed as two manifestations of the same god, representing a continuous cycle of death and rebirth—Amun as the aged form and Khonsu as the youthful, reborn version. Since Amun is periodically reborn as Khonsu, Mut’s role within the divine triad is fluid; she can be wife, mother, and daughter. This shifting relationship reflects the broader concept that Egyptian triads are subdivisions of the primeval and androgynous creator god, who initially impregnated and gave birth to himself. She is called “the daughter and mother who created her own father” and “the mother who became a daughter.” In some texts, she is depicted as the great serpent who encircles her father Ra, and rebirthes him as the god Khonsu. This concept aligns with Amun&#x27;s portrayal as &quot;the bull of his mother,&quot; a title borrowed from Min of Coptos, emphasizing self-creation.

The influence of Heliopolitan theology let to the combination of Amun and Ra into Amun-Ra, as well as the creation of the Theban local forms od Mut-Tefnut and Khonsu-Shu.

===Eye of Ra===
The epithet “Eye of Ra” has been used for Mut since the 19th Dynasty, but does not appear to have been used for Mut in the 18th Dynasty. The myth of the Eye of the Sun and the devastation of the Eye of the Sun in Thebes seem to be older than the cult of Mut. In the Leiden hymn to Amun it is the embodiment of Thebes itself as the goddess who, in the form of Sekhmet, drinks from the waters of Isheruh in Thebes. A text from the time of Thutmoses III also mentions festivities in honor of lioness goddesses such as Bastet, Shesmetet and Wadjet.

The Demotic Papyrus of Leiden records the myth of the return of the Eye of Ra to Egypt. The central figure is a wandering goddess, initially named Tefnut, who takes the form of a sacred cat and briefly a lioness. Her name changes to Mut as she enters Thebes and to Hathor when she reconciles with her father Amun-Ra.In the myth, Ra’s daughter, angered, leaves Egypt and retreats to Ethiopia as a wild cat. Ra sends the god Thoth, in the form of a baboon, to persuade her to return. Initially, she reacts aggressively, but Thoth calms her with a fable about divine retribution for broken oaths, convincing her to spare his life.Thoth then appeals to her emotions, reminding her of her homeland, her twin brother Shu, and the importance of returning to Egypt. Offering her delightful food, he soothes her anger, and she begins to sing praises of her homeland, reinforcing the longing for one&#x27;s origin.

She then transforms into a vulture and flies to Egypt, arriving in Elkab. There, she appears in vulture form and then transforms into a gazelle when she reached Thebes. While resting near Thebes under the protection of the Thoth,she is attacked by followers of Apophis, the serpent of chaos. The baboon warns her, and they flee together in a boat, hiding in the reeds.The myth then describes rituals performed in Thebes in her honor, including songs sung to her to soothe and welcome her.In the end, Mut resumes her divine form as Tefnut, the goddess of moisture and unites with her father Ra.

The appeasement of the sun&#x27;s eye and the reconciliation with her father Amun-Ra was celebrated by playing music, dancing and singing in the Mut destrik. The holding of such festivities in honor of Mut can be dated back to the time of Ramesses II.These rituals involved dancing, singing, and music, as well as the imitation of noises from the underworld, such as the humming of bees and the lowing of bulls. Women played an active role, drinking narcotic potions, lifting their skirts, and seducing men, identifying themselves with the lion goddess, who in mythology became drunk and seduced the creator god. The Mut Temple had a designated &quot;Hall of Drunkenness&quot;, as confirmed by inscriptions from the time of Hatshepsut. This ritual is linked to the Myth of the Destruction of Mankind, where the furious lioness goddess was calmed by drinking red-colored beer. Similarly, the Isheru lake in Mut’s temple was referred to as a &quot;vessel of drunkenness&quot;, reinforcing the connection between intoxication and divine appeasement.

===Isheru===
As the &quot;Eye of Re,&quot; Mut took on the leonine traits of Sekhmet, Bastet, and Tefnut and was known as the &quot;Lady of the Isheru.&quot; The Isheru, a horseshoe-shaped sacred lake linked to lioness goddesses, may have been inspired by an earlier structure, possibly at Bubastis.The Ipethemtes festival in Thebes marked the start of the Nile inundation, following a period of heat, drought, and disease. This ended with the five epagomenal days, seen as unlucky, during which the angry lioness goddess and her messengers spread destruction.At the festival’s climax, people poured &quot;heavenly dew,&quot; a red alcoholic liquid linked to Hapi, over the fields, symbolizing the calming of the Solar Eye and the flood&#x27;s arrival.

The Mut Temple describes the creation of the Isheru lake, with different texts attributing its excavation to Ra-Atum, Nun, or groups of primeval deities. In some versions, Atum-Ra digs out the Isheru for Mut, surrounding it with cooling waters to calm her fiery nature. Another account has Nun forming the Isheru to soothe Mut’s essence and establish her temple after her she returns to Thebes pregnant with Khonsu. Other texts mention the Primeval Gods constructing the lake under Ra&#x27;s command. When Mut returns from the desert, Thoth appeases her, and Ra orders the gods to dig a canal in Thebes, extracting its waters to please her. Despite Mut&#x27;s intense heat, they work with hoes and shovels, and the name &quot;Isheru&quot; comes from the gods&#x27; exclamations of suffering as they complete the task.

===Motherhood===
Numerous texts refer to Mut as a ‘mother,’ and she is occasionally depicted with a divine child on her lap.In Theban mythology, she is also the mother of Khonsu. As the myth goes, Mut ,after approaching Thebes and being calmed by drinking from the Isheru, calls for the aged Amun-Ra. Mut then conceives the Khonsu who embodies the reborn sun, and when the time comes, she gives birth to him in her temple in her temple.

The birth of Khonsu was celebrated in Thebes in the annual Festivael of Renenutet that was held between the end of the month Pharmouthi and the beginning of Pashons. It marked the first day of the harvest season and symbolically linked the birth of child gods to the gathering of new crops. These deities were perceived as providers of fertility and their cyclical rebirth as young solar gods ensured the regeneration of the sun. The festival also incorporated the cult of the reigning monarch, who was identified with the divine child of the local triad, thus reinforcing the legitimacy of royal succession. It became a festivael particularly in honor of Khonsu, after whom the month of Pashons was named after.

In a poorly preserved text from the Second Pylon in the Mut Temple, Mut arrives in Thebes already pregnant. The story of the Eye of the Sun, also known as the myth of the wandering goddess, is used here as the origin of the name for Khonsu, whose name means &quot;wanderer,&quot; as Mut wandered while pregnant with him. The cult of Khonsus childfrom ,Khonsu-pa-khered, was located in the Mut Temple precinct, scholars have debated his precise cult center, occasionally referred to as “the temple of the birth-bed.“In Theban mythology, this temple was believed to be the place where Khonsu was born and raised.

===Patron of women===
She serves as a protector of young women, whom they invoke for help in finding a partner andconceiving children.In Ptolemaic times, a special chapel dedicated to this aspect of Mut existed near the Isheru lake, primarily serving a cult for the deified Ptolemaic ancestors. In this temple, a specific form of Mut called Ash-sedjemes (&quot;She who listens to the one who calls her&quot;) was worshipped, bearing the title &quot;Mistress of young women.&quot;

In Papyrus Insinger 8, women are classified o the nature of Mut and Hathor. In this comparison, Mut embodies the virtuous women while bad women are embodied by Hathor.

==Depictions==

In art, Mut was pictured as a woman with the wings of a vulture, holding an ankh, wearing the united crown of Upper and Lower Egypt and a dress of bright red or blue, with the feather of the goddess Ma&#x27;at at her feet.

Alternatively, as a result of her assimilations, Mut is sometimes depicted as a cobra, a cat, a cow, or as a lioness as well as the vulture.
Before the end of the New Kingdom almost all images of female figures wearing the Double Crown of Upper and Lower Egypt were depictions of the goddess Mut, here labeled &quot;Lady of Heaven, Mistress of All the Gods&quot;. The last image on this page shows the goddess&#x27;s facial features which mark this as a work made sometime between late 18th Dynasty and relatively early in the reign of Ramesses II (reigned c. 1279–1213 BC).

==In Karnak==
There are temples dedicated to Mut still standing in modern-day Egypt and Sudan, reflecting her widespread worship. The center of her cult in Sudan became the Mut Temple of Jebel Barkal and in Egypt the temple in Karnak. That temple had the statue that was regarded as an embodiment of her real &quot;ka&quot;. Her devotions included daily rituals by the pharaoh and her priestesses. Interior reliefs depict scenes of the priestesses, currently the only known remaining example of worship in ancient Egypt that was exclusively administered by women.

Usually the queen served as the chief priestess in the temple rituals. The pharaoh participated also and would become a deity after death. In the case when the pharaoh was female, records of one example indicate that she had her daughter serve as the high priestess in her place. Often priests served in the administration of temples and oracles where priestesses performed the traditional religious rites. These rituals included music and drinking.

The pharaoh Hatshepsut had the ancient temple to Mut at Karnak rebuilt during her rule in the Eighteenth Dynasty. Previous excavators had thought that Amenhotep III had the temple built because of the hundreds of statues found there of Sekhmet that bore his name. However, Hatshepsut, who completed an enormous number of temples and public buildings, had completed the work seventy-five years earlier. She began the custom of depicting Mut with the crown of both Upper and Lower Egypt. It is thought that Amenhotep III removed most signs of Hatshepsut, while taking credit for the projects she had built.

Hatshepsut was a pharaoh who brought Mut to the fore again in the Egyptian pantheon, identifying strongly with the goddess. She stated that she was a descendant of Mut. She also associated herself with the image of Sekhmet, as the more aggressive aspect of the goddess, having served as a very successful warrior during the early portion of her reign as pharaoh.

Later in the same dynasty, Akhenaten suppressed the worship of Mut as well as the other deities when he promoted the monotheistic worship of his sun god, Aten. Tutankhamun later re-established her worship and his successors continued to associate themselves with Mut afterward.

Ramesses II added more work on the Mut temple during the nineteenth dynasty, as well as rebuilding an earlier temple in the same area, rededicating it to Amun and himself. He placed it so that people would have to pass his temple on their way to that of Mut.

Kushite pharaohs expanded the Mut temple and modified the Ramesses temple for use as the shrine of the celebrated birth of Amun and Khonsu, trying to integrate themselves into divine succession. They also installed their own priestesses among the ranks of the priestesses who officiated at the temple of Mut.

The Greek Ptolemaic dynasty added its own decorations and priestesses at the temple as well and used the authority of Mut to emphasize their own interests.

Later, the Roman emperor Tiberius rebuilt the site after a severe flood and his successors supported the temple until it fell into disuse, sometime around the third century AD. Later Roman officials used the stones from the temple for their own building projects, often without altering the images carved upon them.

== Personal piety ==
In the wake of Akhenaten&#x27;s revolution, and the subsequent restoration of traditional beliefs and practices, the emphasis in personal piety moved towards greater reliance on divine, rather than human, protection for the individual. During the reign of Rameses II a follower of the goddess Mut donated all his property to her temple and recorded in his tomb:

And he [Kiki] found Mut at the head of the gods, Fate and fortune in her hand, Lifetime and breath of life are hers to command ... I have not chosen a protector among men. I have not sought myself a protector among the great ... My heart is filled with my mistress. I have no fear of anyone. I spend the night in quiet sleep, because I have a protector.

<text>Khonsu (; also transliterated Chonsu, Khensu, Khons, Chons, Khonshu or Konshu; ) is an ancient Egyptian god of the Moon. His name means &#x27;traveller&#x27;, and this may relate to the perceived nightly travel of the Moon across the sky. Along with Thoth, he marked the passage of time and is associated with baboons. Khonsu was instrumental in the creation of new life in all living creatures. At Thebes, he formed part of a family triad (the &quot;Theban Triad&quot;) with Mut as his mother and Amun his father.

== Attributes ==
In art, Khonsu is typically depicted as a mummy with the symbol of childhood, a sidelock of hair, as well as the menat necklace with crook and flail. He has close links to other divine children such as Horus and Shu. He was also portrayed with the head of a falcon and like Horus, with whom he is associated as a protector and healer, adorned with the moon disk and crescent moon.Khonsu is mentioned in the Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts, in which he is depicted in a fierce aspect, but he does not rise to prominence until the New Kingdom, when he is described as the &quot;Greatest God of the Great Gods&quot;. Most of the construction of the temple complex at Karnak was centered on Khonsu during the Ramesside period. The Temple of Khonsu at Karnak is in a relatively good state of preservation, and on one of the walls is depicted a creation myth in which Khonsu is described as the great snake who fertilizes the Cosmic Egg in the creation of the world.

Khonsu&#x27;s reputation as a healer spread outside Egypt; the Bentresh stela records how a princess of Bekhten was instantly cured of an illness upon the arrival of an image of Khonsu. King Ptolemy IV, after he was cured of an illness, called himself &quot;Beloved of Khonsu Who Protects His Majesty and Drives Away Evil Spirits&quot;.

Locations of Khonsu&#x27;s cult were Memphis, Hibis and Edfu.

== Mythology ==
Khonsu&#x27;s name means &#x27;traveller&#x27; and therefore reflects the fact that the Moon (referred to as Iah in Egyptian) travels across the night sky. He was also referred to by the titles &quot;Embracer&quot;, &quot;Pathfinder&quot;, &quot;Defender&quot;, and &quot;healer&quot;, and was thought to watch over those who travel at night. As the god of light in the night, Khonsu was invoked to protect against wild animals, and aid with healing. It was said that when Khonsu caused the crescent moon to shine, women conceived, cattle became fertile, and all nostrils and every throat were filled with fresh air.
===Role in the underworld===
The earliest known mention of the god appears in the so-called Cannibal Hymn within the Pyramid Texts. As the butcher of other gods, he is said to extract their entrails and offer them to the deceased king in order to absorb their magical powers. This process was intended to help the deceased king achieve immortality and regain vitality.

In the Cannibal Hymn of the Unas Pyramid, Khonsu is named as a member of a group of demons composed of three unknown deities, whose names can be translated to &quot;The Seizer of Heads,&quot; &quot;The One with his head raised,&quot; and &quot;The One Above the Redness,&quot; as well as the god Shezmu. These five bloodthirsty helpers were placed in the sky, likely based on a constellations or other celestial phenomena. Additionally, they are considered messengers of death, sent forth by the deceased.

From the Old Kingdom to the Middle Kingdom, Khonsu is referred to in several tomb inscriptions as a Wepwety (Wpwty), a term often translated as &quot;messenger&quot;. This designation refers to underworld deities which were understood as death-bringing spirits and punishers of the deceased.

Further connections to Khonsu and the destruction of heart ceremony can be found in Spell 310 of the Coffin Texts, where he is described as the son of the goddess Shezmetet and tasked with burning hearts with his fiery wrath. Spell 311 of the Coffin Texts aims to help the deceased transform into Khonsu to steal the gods&#x27; magical powers and defend against hostile forces. In this context, he is referred to as &quot;Khonsu who lives on hearts.&quot; During the New Kingdom period, the role of devourer of hearts was taken over by the goddess Ammit.

===Role as a moon god===
Khonsu&#x27;s connection to the moon traces back to the association of the crescent moon with the ancient Egyptian sickle sword, which Khonsu embodies as an instrument of justice, giving him the epitheth &quot;Khonsu the sharp. The earliest indications of Khonsu&#x27;s lunar attributes appear in Coffin Texts Spells 197 and 195, where the deceased encounters Khonsu returning from Punt. The land of Punt symbolizes the east and the place of the sun&#x27;s and moon&#x27;s rising in ancient Egyptian literature.

In the New Kingdom period, the lunar cycle was associated with the phases of life. The crescent moon was also linked to the horns of a bull and became a masculine symbol of fertility. A Ptolemaic inscription from the Khonsu Temple in Thebes describes Khonsu and the sun god as bulls crossing the sky and meeting in the east as &quot;the two illuminators of the heavens&quot;. This meeting of the two bulls is theorized to either refer to the arrival of the full moon or the simultaneous presence of the sun and moon in the sky. Here, the crescent moon is portrayed as a young bull, while Khonsu ages into an old castrated bull during the full before renewing himself at the beginning of the next lunar cycle.

Depictions of Khonsu as a child, or young bull, symbolized the beginning of the lunar cycle and the month&#x27;s renewal. The rarer depiction of Khonsu as a two-faced child represents the time when the moon is not visible at night.
His development from a child to an old man was also applied to the annual cycle, making Khonsu in his youthful manifestation (Khonsu-pa-khered) the bringer of spring and fertility. Inscriptions in his temple in Karnak refer to him as: &quot;the first great [son] of Amun, the beautiful youth, who maketh himself young in Thebes in the form of Ra, the son of the goddess Nubit. A child in the morning, an old man in the evening, a youth at the beginning of the year, who cometh as a child after he had become infirm, and who reneweth his births like the Dusk“

In the Temple of Edfu, the &quot;Complex of Khonsu&quot; contains the &quot;Chamber of the Leg,&quot; dedicated to Khonsu. His association with the leg originates from the Osiris myth, in which Osiris&#x27; leg was found and preserved in Edfu. Thus, Khonsu is referred to in Edfu as the &quot;Son of the Leg.&quot;

Khonsu and Osiris were also equated in the Temple of the Goddess Ipet, located next to the Khonsu Temple in Karnak. In the Ipet Temple, Amun was worshiped as the sun god and son of the goddess Ipet-Nut. As a part of a mythical journey, the sun was said to die daily and enter the underworld as the god Osiris and become Khonsu when it is reborn at dawn.

According to Ptolemaic Egyptian legends, Thebes was the first city in Egypt, founded by Osiris and named after his mother, the sky goddess Nut. This connection is a play on the ancient Egyptian word for city (&quot;niwt&quot;). For this reason, in Ptolemaic inscriptions, Thebes is referred to as the heaven itself that houses both the sun (Amun-wer) and the moon (Khonsu).

===Role as a creator god===
During the later period of the New Kingdom, Khonsu was also worshipped as a creator god. As such, he was depicted as a man with two falcon heads, vulture wings, and standing on the back of a crocodile. The two heads represent the sun and the moon, while standing on the crocodile symbolizes triumph over the chaotic primordial forces.

The Khonsu cosmogony, as described in the Khonsu Temple at Karnak, portrays the god as a central figure in the creation of the world. The narrative explains how the god Amun emerged from the Nun as a serpent and deposited his semen into the primordial waters in the form of a falcon egg. Khonsu, the second primordial snake and son of Amun, devours the semen and becomes pregnant by it. In the form of a crocodile, Khonsu travels to the primordial mount to cleanse his mouth of the waters of Nun. There, he copulates with the goddess Hathor-in-Benenet. Through their union, the city of Thebes is born, and Khonsu gives birth to the eight gods of the Ogdoad. The Ogdoad then ascends to the Island of Flames, where they create the sun god.

In this cosmogony, Amun is given the epithet “Father of the Fathers of the Ogdoad” and is explicitly not considered part of the group of eight gods, emphasizing his status as the supreme deity. Variants of this epithet found in Thebes include: “Father of the Fathers of the Gods of the First Primeval Time,” “Father of the Fathers Who Created the Gods of the Primeval Time,” and “The Father of the Fathers Who Made the One Who Made You.” Instead of Amun and Amunet, Niau and Niaut form the final divine pair of the Ogdoad in the Khonsu cosmogony

== Forms of Khonsu==
=== Khonsu-Neferhotep ===
The primary cult of Khonsu at the Karnak Temple during the New Kingdom centered on his manifestation as Khonsu-Neferhotep. This form of Khonsu may have emerged through syncretism with the deity Neferhotep, who was worshipped in Diospolis Parva. Alternatively, &quot;Neferhotep&quot; might have been an epithet added to Khonsu’s name as early as the Middle Kingdom. Inscriptions frequently attribute additional epithets to this form, including “Khonsu-Neferhotep, Horus-Lord of Joy in Karnak,” “Khonsu-Neferhotep, Lord of Maat on the Great Throne,” and “Khonsu-Neferhotep-in-Thebes.”

Khonsu-Neferhotep is depicted either as a mummified youth or as a falcon-headed adult, often positioned behind Amun in temple imagery. Other representations of Khonsu, such as his form as a baboon, were deliberately excluded from depictions of Khonsu-Neferhotep. This distinction served to separate Khonsu-Neferhotep, the son of Amun, from the broader cult of the mature Khonsu, which existed independently of Amun’s worship.
As the firstborn son of Amun and his rightful heir, Khonsu-Neferhotep ranked directly below Amun in the hierarchy of Theban deities. In Theban creation myths, he is regarded as part of the second divine generation—subordinate to Amun but above other gods—and is revered as a co-creator of deities.

Like many of Khonsu’s manifestations, Khonsu-Neferhotep was venerated as a moon god who traversed the night sky on the lunar bark, journeying between the mythical mountains of Bakhu and Manu. In Egyptian cosmology, these mountains were believed to support the heavens and marked the entry and exit points of the underworld.

Khonsu-Neferhotep also held a prominent role as an authoritative and judicial deity. At the Khonsu Temple in Karnak, individuals swore oaths in his name to uphold obligations, such as repaying debts. Family disputes, including cases of divorce and inheritance, were also resolved with oaths sworn in his honor. In some Greek oath formulas, Khonsu was equated with Heracles, reflecting his identification with this figure in the Greco-Roman period. He was also known by his Hellenized name, Kesebaieon.

In his temple at Thebes, Khonsu-Neferhotep’s consort was a local manifestation of the goddess Hathor, referred to as “Hathor within the Benenet.” She was honored with the epithet “the Lady of the Heart of Ra,” a reference to one of Khonsu-Neferhotep’s titles, “the Heart of Ra.” In their primordial aspects, they were also referred to as “Khonsu the Elder” and “Hathor the Elder,” respectively.

=== Khonsu-Thoth ===
Khonsu-Thoth, a syncretic deity merging the lunar aspects of Khonsu and Thoth, was venerated in Edfu, Philae, and Thebes. In the temple of Khonsu in Karnak (also referred to as the Benenet), baboons were housed in a designated district and revered as living embodiments of Khonsu-Thoth. A specialized priesthood cared for these baboons and integrated them into oracle rituals. Khonsu-Thoth played an important role in several Theban rituals like the Theban New Year ritual for the Confirmation of Royal Power, a ceremony to release messenger birds, royal offerings to Iah-Lunus, the ritual burnings of the Thoth festival, a symbolic bull race, and the cosmic coronation of Khonsu-Thoth-Iah. He filled the role of supreme judge and vizier within the Theban pantheon.

The syncretism between Thoth and Khonsu also extended to a fusion of Hathor-within-the-Benenet with Seshat and Maat, the two traditional consorts of Thoth. An ancient text describes them as the &quot;two divine beings originating from Ra&quot;: one symbolizing the embodiment of Ra&#x27;s contemplative heart and the tongue through which the word is spoken, and the other representing creative thought and the divine word, which brings creation into being.

== In popular culture ==

Khonsu appears as a character in Marvel Comics, where the spelling of his name was changed to &#x27;Khonshu&#x27;. In the comics, the character Moon Knight is the avatar of Khonshu and is also known as &quot;The Fist of Khonshu&quot;. Khonshu grants the protagonist Marc Spector supernatural abilities to fight evil in his name, enhancing his strength, endurance, and reflexes depending upon the phases of the moon, but also slowly drives him insane. Khonshu&#x27;s nature changes depending on the writer; Doug Moench portrays Khonshu as a neutral figure, but later writers make him more active and malicious. It is often implied that this Khonshu is not a supernatural being at all, but a mental construct of Marc Spector, a hallucination, an alternate or dissociative personality, or a malicious alien parasite. During Volume 2, Moon Knight is given special weapons by the cult of Khonshu. Khonshu also appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) television series &quot;Moon Knight&quot;, voiced by F. Murray Abraham. In the show Khonshu is shown to prey on Marc&#x27;s mental issues and his relationships in life to make it so that Marc Spector will fight for him.

In the film series &quot;Night at the Museum&quot;, Khonsu is the source of the magical Tablet of Ahkmenrah, which brings the museum exhibits to life each night. In the story of &quot;Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb&quot;, the golden tablet was created by the high priest of the temple of Khonsu using Khonsu&#x27;s magic. The tomb of Ahkmenrah was designed to channel &quot;Khonsu&#x27;s rays&quot; (moonlight) down to the tablet, rejuvenating its powers every night. If the tablet is away from &quot;Khonsu&#x27;s light [for] too long&quot;, the exhibits that were brought to life will die.

<text>Primary nutritional groups are groups of organisms, divided in relation to the nutrition mode according to the sources of energy and carbon, needed for living, growth and reproduction. The sources of energy can be light or chemical compounds; the sources of carbon can be of organic or inorganic origin.

The terms &quot;aerobic respiration&quot;, &quot;anaerobic respiration&quot; and &quot;fermentation&quot; (&quot;substrate-level phosphorylation&quot;) do not refer to primary nutritional groups, but simply reflect the different use of possible electron acceptors in particular organisms, such as in aerobic respiration, or nitrate (), sulfate () or fumarate in anaerobic respiration, or various metabolic intermediates in fermentation.

== Primary sources of energy ==
&quot;Phototrophs&quot; absorb light in photoreceptors and transform it into chemical energy.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Chemotrophs&quot; release chemical energy.

The freed energy is stored as potential energy in ATP, carbohydrates, or proteins. Eventually, the energy is used for life processes such as moving, growth and reproduction.

Plants and some bacteria can alternate between phototrophy and chemotrophy, depending on the availability of light.

== Primary sources of reducing equivalents ==

&quot;Organotrophs&quot; use organic compounds as electron/hydrogen donors.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Lithotrophs&quot; use inorganic compounds as electron/hydrogen donors.

The electrons or hydrogen atoms from reducing equivalents (electron donors) are needed by both phototrophs and chemotrophs in reduction-oxidation reactions that transfer energy in the anabolic processes of ATP synthesis (in heterotrophs) or biosynthesis (in autotrophs). The electron or hydrogen donors are taken up from the environment.

Organotrophic organisms are often also heterotrophic, using organic compounds as sources of both electrons and carbon. Similarly, lithotrophic organisms are often also autotrophic, using inorganic sources of electrons and as their inorganic carbon source.

Some lithotrophic bacteria can utilize diverse sources of electrons, depending on the availability of possible donors.

The organic or inorganic substances (e.g., oxygen) used as electron acceptors needed in the catabolic processes of aerobic or anaerobic respiration and fermentation are not taken into account here.

For example, plants are lithotrophs because they use water as their electron donor for the electron transport chain across the thylakoid membrane. Animals are organotrophs because they use organic compounds as electron donors to synthesize ATP (plants also do this, but this is not taken into account). Both use oxygen in respiration as electron acceptor, but this character is not used to define them as lithotrophs.

== Primary sources of carbon ==

&quot;Heterotrophs&quot; metabolize organic compounds to obtain carbon for growth and development.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Autotrophs&quot; use carbon dioxide () as their source of carbon.

== Energy and carbon ==
A &quot;chemoorganoheterotrophic&quot; organism is one that requires organic substrates to get its carbon for growth and development, and that obtains its energy from the decomposition of an organic compound. This group of organisms may be further subdivided according to what kind of organic substrate and compound they use. Decomposers are examples of chemoorganoheterotrophs which obtain carbon and electrons or hydrogen from dead organic matter. Herbivores and carnivores are examples of organisms that obtain carbon and electrons or hydrogen from living organic matter.

Chemoorganotrophs are organisms which use the chemical energy in organic compounds as their energy source and obtain electrons or hydrogen from the organic compounds, including sugars (i.e. glucose), fats and proteins. Chemoheterotrophs also obtain the carbon atoms that they need for cellular function from these organic compounds.

All animals are chemoheterotrophs (meaning they oxidize chemical compounds as a source of energy and carbon), as are fungi, protozoa, and some bacteria. The important differentiation amongst this group is that chemoorganotrophs oxidize only organic compounds while chemolithotrophs instead use oxidation of inorganic compounds as a source of energy.

==Primary metabolism table==
The following table gives some examples for each nutritional group:
*Some authors use &quot;-hydro-&quot; when the source is water.
The common final part &quot;-troph&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;nutrition&quot;.

== Mixotrophs ==

Some, usually unicellular, organisms can switch between different metabolic modes, for example between photoautotrophy, photoheterotrophy, and chemoheterotrophy in &quot;Chroococcales&quot;. &quot;Rhodopseudomonas palustris&quot; – another example – can grow with or without oxygen, use either light, inorganic or organic compounds for energy. Such mixotrophic organisms may dominate their habitat, due to their capability to use more resources than either photoautotrophic or organoheterotrophic organisms.

==Examples==
All sorts of combinations may exist in nature, but some are more common than others. For example, most plants are &quot;photolithoautotrophic&quot;, since they use light as an energy source, water as electron donor, and as a carbon source. All animals and fungi are &quot;chemoorganoheterotrophic&quot;, since they use organic substances both as chemical energy sources and as electron/hydrogen donors and carbon sources. Some eukaryotic microorganisms, however, are not limited to just one nutritional mode. For example, some algae live photoautotrophically in the light, but shift to chemoorganoheterotrophy in the dark. Even higher plants retained their ability to respire heterotrophically on starch at night which had been synthesised phototrophically during the day.

Prokaryotes show a great diversity of nutritional categories. For example, cyanobacteria and many purple sulfur bacteria can be &quot;photolithoautotrophic&quot;, using light for energy, or sulfide as electron/hydrogen donors, and as carbon source, whereas green non-sulfur bacteria can be &quot;photoorganoheterotrophic&quot;, using organic molecules as both electron/hydrogen donors and carbon sources. Many bacteria are &quot;chemoorganoheterotrophic&quot;, using organic molecules as energy, electron/hydrogen and carbon sources. Some bacteria are limited to only one nutritional group, whereas others are facultative and switch from one mode to the other, depending on the nutrient sources available. Sulfur-oxidizing, iron, and anammox bacteria as well as methanogens are &quot;chemolithoautotrophs&quot;, using inorganic energy, electron, and carbon sources. &quot;Chemolithoheterotrophs&quot; are rare because heterotrophy implies the availability of organic substrates, which can also serve as easy electron sources, making lithotrophy unnecessary. &quot;Photoorganoautotrophs&quot; are uncommon since their organic source of electrons/hydrogens would provide an easy carbon source, resulting in heterotrophy.

Synthetic biology efforts enabled the transformation of the trophic mode of two model microorganisms from heterotrophy to chemoorganoautotrophy:

* &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; was genetically engineered and then evolved in the laboratory to use as the sole carbon source while using the one-carbon molecule formate as the source of electrons.
* The methylotrophic &quot;Pichia pastoris&quot; yeast was genetically engineered to use as the carbon source instead of methanol, while the latter remained the source of electrons for the cells.

<text>A heterotroph (; ) is an organism that cannot produce its own food, instead taking nutrition from other sources of organic carbon, mainly plant or animal matter. In the food chain, heterotrophs are primary, secondary and tertiary consumers, but not producers. Living organisms that are heterotrophic include all animals and fungi, some bacteria and protists, and many parasitic plants. The term heterotroph arose in microbiology in 1946 as part of a classification of microorganisms based on their type of nutrition. The term is now used in many fields, such as ecology, in describing the food chain. Heterotrophs occupy the second and third tropic levels of the food chain while autotrophs occupy the first trophic level.

Heterotrophs may be subdivided according to their energy source. If the heterotroph uses chemical energy, it is a chemoheterotroph (e.g., humans and mushrooms). If it uses light for energy, then it is a photoheterotroph (e.g., green non-sulfur bacteria).

Heterotrophs represent one of the two mechanisms of nutrition (trophic levels), the other being autotrophs (&quot;auto&quot; = self, &quot;troph&quot; = nutrition). Autotrophs use energy from sunlight (photoautotrophs) or oxidation of inorganic compounds (lithoautotrophs) to convert inorganic carbon dioxide to organic carbon compounds and energy to sustain their life. Comparing the two in basic terms, heterotrophs (such as animals) eat either autotrophs (such as plants) or other heterotrophs, or both.
Detritivores are heterotrophs which obtain nutrients by consuming detritus (decomposing plant and animal parts as well as feces). Saprotrophs (also called lysotrophs) are chemoheterotrophs that use extracellular digestion in processing decayed organic matter. The process is most often facilitated through the active transport of such materials through endocytosis within the internal mycelium and its constituent hyphae.

==Types==
Heterotrophs can be organotrophs or lithotrophs. Organotrophs exploit reduced carbon compounds as electron sources, like carbohydrates, fats, and proteins from plants and animals. On the other hand, lithoheterotrophs use inorganic compounds, such as ammonium, nitrite, or sulfur, to obtain electrons. Another way of classifying different heterotrophs is by assigning them as chemotrophs or phototrophs. Phototrophs utilize light to obtain energy and carry out metabolic processes, whereas chemotrophs use the energy obtained by the oxidation of chemicals from their environment.

Photoorganoheterotrophs, such as Rhodospirillaceae and purple non-sulfur bacteria synthesize organic compounds using sunlight coupled with oxidation of organic substances.
They use organic compounds to build structures. They do not fix carbon dioxide and apparently do not have the Calvin cycle. Chemolithoheterotrophs like &quot;Oceanithermus profundus&quot; obtain energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds, including hydrogen sulfide, elemental sulfur, thiosulfate, and molecular hydrogen. Mixotrophs (or facultative chemolithotroph) can use either carbon dioxide or organic carbon as the carbon source, meaning that mixotrophs have the ability to use both heterotrophic and autotrophic methods.
Although mixotrophs have the ability to grow under both heterotrophic and autotrophic conditions, &quot;C. vulgaris&quot; have higher biomass and lipid productivity when growing under heterotrophic compared to autotrophic conditions.

Heterotrophs, by consuming reduced carbon compounds, are able to use all the energy that they obtain from food for growth and reproduction, unlike autotrophs, which must use some of their energy for carbon fixation. Both heterotrophs and autotrophs alike are usually dependent on the metabolic activities of other organisms for nutrients other than carbon, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, and can die from lack of food that supplies these nutrients. This applies not only to animals and fungi but also to bacteria.

== Origin and diversification ==
The chemical origin of life hypothesis suggests that life originated in a prebiotic soup with heterotrophs. The summary of this theory is as follows: early Earth had a highly reducing atmosphere and energy sources such as electrical energy in the form of lightning, which resulted in reactions that formed simple organic compounds, which further reacted to form more complex compounds and eventually resulted in life. Alternative theories of an autotrophic origin of life contradict this theory.

The theory of a chemical origin of life beginning with heterotrophic life was first proposed in 1924 by Alexander Ivanovich Oparin, and eventually published &quot;The Origin of Life.&quot; It was independently proposed for the first time in English in 1929 by John Burdon Sanderson Haldane. While these authors agreed on the gasses present and the progression of events to a point, Oparin championed a progressive complexity of organic matter prior to the formation of cells, while Haldane had more considerations about the concept of genes as units of heredity and the possibility of light playing a role in chemical synthesis (autotrophy).  

Evidence grew to support this theory in 1953, when Stanley Miller conducted an experiment in which he added gasses that were thought to be present on early Earth – water (H2O), methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), and hydrogen (H2) – to a flask and stimulated them with electricity that resembled lightning present on early Earth. The experiment resulted in the discovery that early Earth conditions were supportive of the production of amino acids, with recent re-analyses of the data recognizing that over 40 different amino acids were produced, including several not currently used by life. This experiment heralded the beginning of the field of synthetic prebiotic chemistry, and is now known as the Miller–Urey experiment.

On early Earth, oceans and shallow waters were rich with organic molecules that could have been used by primitive heterotrophs. This method of obtaining energy was energetically favorable until organic carbon became more scarce than inorganic carbon, providing a potential evolutionary pressure to become autotrophic. Following the evolution of autotrophs, heterotrophs were able to utilize them as a food source instead of relying on the limited nutrients found in their environment. Eventually, autotrophic and heterotrophic cells were engulfed by these early heterotrophs and formed a symbiotic relationship. The endosymbiosis of autotrophic cells is suggested to have evolved into the chloroplasts while the endosymbiosis of smaller heterotrophs developed into the mitochondria, allowing the differentiation of tissues and development into multicellularity. This advancement allowed the further diversification of heterotrophs. Today, many heterotrophs and autotrophs also utilize mutualistic relationships that provide needed resources to both organisms. One example of this is the mutualism between corals and algae, where the former provides protection and necessary compounds for photosynthesis while the latter provides oxygen.

However this hypothesis is controversial as CO2 was the main carbon source at the early Earth, suggesting that early cellular life were autotrophs that relied upon inorganic substrates as an energy source and lived at alkaline hydrothermal vents or acidic geothermal ponds. Simple biomolecules transported from space was considered to have been either too reduced to have been fermented or too heterogeneous to support microbial growth. Heterotrophic microbes likely originated at low H2 partial pressures. Bases, amino acids, and ribose are considered to be the first fermentation substrates.

Heterotrophs are currently found in each domain of life: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Domain Bacteria includes a variety of metabolic activity including photoheterotrophs, chemoheterotrophs, organotrophs, and heterolithotrophs. Within Domain Eukarya, kingdoms Fungi and Animalia are entirely heterotrophic, though most fungi absorb nutrients through their environment. Most organisms within Kingdom Protista are heterotrophic while Kingdom Plantae is almost entirely autotrophic, except for myco-heterotrophic plants. Lastly, Domain Archaea varies immensely in metabolic functions and contains many methods of heterotrophy.

==Ecology==
Many heterotrophs are chemoorganoheterotrophs that use organic carbon (e.g. glucose) as their carbon source, and organic chemicals (e.g. carbohydrates, lipids, proteins) as their electron sources. Heterotrophs function as consumers in food chain: they obtain these nutrients from saprotrophic, parasitic, or holozoic nutrients. They break down complex organic compounds (e.g., carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) produced by autotrophs into simpler compounds (e.g., carbohydrates into glucose, fats into fatty acids and glycerol, and proteins into amino acids). They release the chemical energy of nutrient molecules by oxidizing carbon and hydrogen atoms from carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins to carbon dioxide and water, respectively.

They can catabolize organic compounds by respiration, fermentation, or both. Fermenting heterotrophs are either facultative or obligate anaerobes that carry out fermentation in low oxygen environments, in which the production of ATP is commonly coupled with substrate-level phosphorylation and the production of end products (e.g. alcohol, , sulfide). These products can then serve as the substrates for other bacteria in the anaerobic digest, and be converted into CO2 and CH4, which is an important step for the carbon cycle for removing organic fermentation products from anaerobic environments. Heterotrophs can undergo respiration, in which ATP production is coupled with oxidative phosphorylation. This leads to the release of oxidized carbon wastes such as CO2 and reduced wastes like H2O, H2S, or N2O into the atmosphere. Heterotrophic microbes&#x27; respiration and fermentation account for a large portion of the release of CO2 into the atmosphere, making it available for autotrophs as a source of nutrient and plants as a cellulose synthesis substrate.

Respiration in heterotrophs is often accompanied by mineralization, the process of converting organic compounds to inorganic forms. When the organic nutrient source taken in by the heterotroph contains essential elements such as N, S, P in addition to C, H, and O, they are often removed first to proceed with the oxidation of organic nutrient and production of ATP via respiration. S and N in organic carbon source are transformed into H2S and NH4+ through desulfurylation and deamination, respectively. Heterotrophs also allow for dephosphorylation as part of decomposition. The conversion of N and S from organic form to inorganic form is a critical part of the nitrogen and sulfur cycle. H2S formed from desulfurylation is further oxidized by lithotrophs and phototrophs while NH4+ formed from deamination is further oxidized by lithotrophs to the forms available to plants. Heterotrophs&#x27; ability to mineralize essential elements is critical to plant survival.

Most opisthokonts and prokaryotes are heterotrophic; in particular, all animals and fungi are heterotrophs. Some animals, such as corals, form symbiotic relationships with autotrophs and obtain organic carbon in this way. Furthermore, some parasitic plants have also turned fully or partially heterotrophic, while carnivorous plants consume animals to augment their nitrogen supply while remaining autotrophic.

Animals are classified as heterotrophs by ingestion, fungi are classified as heterotrophs by absorption.

<text>In Egyptian mythology, Sekhmet ( or Sachmis , from ; ) is a warrior goddess as well as goddess of medicine.

Sekhmet is also a solar deity, sometimes given the epithet &#x27;the eye of Ra&#x27;. She is often associated with the goddesses Hathor and Bastet.

== Roles ==
Sekhmet is the daughter of the sun god, Ra, and is among the more important of the goddesses in the Egyptian Pantheon. Sekhmet acted as the vengeful manifestation of Ra&#x27;s power, the Eye of Ra. Sekhmet is said to breathe fire, and the hot winds of the desert were likened to her breath. She is also believed to cause plagues (which were described as being her servants or messengers) although she is also called upon to ward off disease and heal the sick.

In a myth about the end of Ra&#x27;s rule on the earth, Ra sends the goddess Hathor, in the form of Sekhmet, to destroy mortals who conspired against him. In the myth, Sekhmet&#x27;s bloodlust was not quenched at the end of battle, and this led to her going on a bloody rampage that laid Egypt to waste and almost destroyed all of humanity. To stop her, Ra and the other gods devised a plan. They poured out a lake of beer dyed with red ochre so that it resembled blood. Mistaking the beer for blood, Sekhmet drank it all and became so drunk that she gave up on the slaughter and returned peacefully to Ra. The same myth was also described in the prognosis texts of the Calendar of Lucky and Unlucky Days of Papyrus Cairo 86637.In other versions of this story, Sekhmet grew angered at the deception and left Egypt, diminishing the power of the sun. This threatened the power and security of the world—thus, she was persuaded by the god Thoth to return and restore the sun to its full glory. Sekhmet&#x27;s feline attributes and her iconography sometimes make it difficult to differentiate Sekhmet from other feline goddesses – mainly Bastet.

Sekhmet was considered the wife of the god Ptah and mother of his son Nefertum. She was also said to be the mother of the lion-headed war god, Maahes. She was also considered to be the sister of the cat goddess Bastet. The lion-headed goddess Sekhmet is the most represented deity in most Egyptian collections worldwide. Many amulets depict her image and her numerous statues abound in Egyptian art. Many of her statues can be found in museums and archaeological sites, and her presence testifies to the historical and cultural importance of this goddess.

== Worship ==
During an annual festival held at the beginning of the year, a festival of intoxication, the Egyptians danced and played music to soothe the wildness of the goddess and drank great quantities of beer and wine ritually to imitate the extreme drunkenness that stopped the wrath of the goddess—when she almost destroyed humanity.In 2006, Betsy Bryan, an archaeologist with Johns Hopkins University excavating at the temple of Mut in Luxor (Thebes) presented her findings about the festival that included illustrations of the priestesses being served to excess and its adverse effects on them being ministered to by temple attendants. Participation in the festival was great, including by the priestesses and the population. Historical records of tens of thousands attending the festival exist. These findings were made in the temple of Mut because when Thebes rose to greater prominence Mut absorbed some characteristics of Sekhmet. These temple excavations at Luxor discovered a &quot;porch of drunkenness&quot; built onto the temple by the Pharaoh Hatshepsut during the height of her twenty-year reign.

During the Greek dominance in Egypt, note was made of a temple for Maahes that was an auxiliary facility to a large temple to Sekhmet at Taremu in the Delta region, a city which the Greeks called Leontopolis.

==History==

The first known unambiguous reference to Sekhmet has been found in mortuary complex of Nyuserre Ini of the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt. She seems to have been a comparatively minor figure in the old kingdom becoming much more significant in the new kingdom. Around 700 (but perhaps significantly more) statues of Sekhmet of were constructed for the Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III during the middle kingdom.

Sekhmet is worshipped by some modern pagans particularly those who follow Goddess Spirituality. The worship may involve modern statues of Sekhmet but also of those in museum collections.

==Comparative scholarship==
In the 1960s it has been argued that the Hindu goddess Kālī, who is first attested in the 7th century CE, shares some characteristics with some ancient Near Eastern goddesses, such wearing a necklace of heads and a belt of severed hands like Anat, and drinking blood like the Egyptian goddess Sekhmet and that therefore that her character might have been influenced by them. A myth describes how Kali became ecstatic with the joy of battle and slaughter while killing demons, and refused to stop until she was pacified by her consort, Shiva, who threw himself under her feet. Marvin H. Pope in 1977 asserted that this myth exhibits parallels to the Egyptian myth in which Sekhmet was sent by Ra to destroy the humans plotting against him only to become so captured by her blood-lust that she would not stop despite Ra himself becoming distressed and wishing an end to the killing, only to be stopped by a ruse whereby a plain was flooded with beer which had been dyed red, which Sekhmet mistook for blood and drank until she became too inebriated to continue killing, thus saving humanity from destruction.

<text>Ipomoea corymbosa is a species of morning glory, native throughout Latin America from Mexico as far south as Peru and widely naturalised elsewhere. Its common names include Christmasvine, Christmaspops, and snakeplant.

==Description and names==

Known to natives of north and central Mexico by its Nahuatl name, coaxihuitl and by the south eastern natives as xtabentún (in Mayan), it is a perennial climbing vine with white flowers, often grown as an ornamental plant. Its flowers secrete copious amount of nectar, and the honey that bees make from it is very clear and aromatic. It also grows in Cuba, where it usually blooms from early December to February. It is considered one of the main honey plants of the island.

This plant is often used for purposes other than recreation, as natives of Mexico consider the flour produced from its seeds (distinguished as &quot;ololiuhqui&quot; (&quot;round things&quot;)) a tool for divination and communion with spirits. Because of the widespread use among native tribes, Colonial rules initially feared &quot;ololiuhqui&quot; and banned it introducing harsh punishments for users.

==Chemical properties==
The Nahuatl word &quot;ololiuhqui&quot; means &quot;round thing&quot;, and refers to the small, brown, oval seeds of the morning glory, not the plant itself, which is called &quot;coaxihuitl&quot; (“snake-plant&quot;) in Nahuatl, and &quot;hiedra&quot;, &quot;bejuco&quot; or &quot;quiebraplatos&quot; in the Spanish language. The seeds, in Spanish, are sometimes called &quot;semilla de la Virgen&quot; (seeds of the Virgin Mary). While little of it is known outside of Mexico, its seeds were perhaps the most common psychedelic drug used by the natives.

In 1941, Richard Evans Schultes first identified ololiuhqui as &quot;Turbina corymbosa&quot; and the chemical composition was first described in 1960 in a paper by Albert Hofmann. The seeds contain ergine (LSA), an ergoline alkaloid which is also present in ergot of rye and is similar in structure to LSD. Ergot of rye was part of the Kykeon, the drink which was a component of the Eleusinian mysteries. The psychedelic properties of &quot;Turbina corymbosa&quot; and a comparison of the potency of different varieties were studied in the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s MKULTRA Subproject 22 in 1956.


==Distribution==
This species is an invasive species to the United States, Europe (Spain), and Australia, where it has become more naturalized.

<text>Ptah ( ; , ; ; ; ) is an ancient Egyptian deity, a creator god and patron deity of craftsmen and architects. In the triad of Memphis, he is the husband of Sekhmet and the father of Nefertem. He was also regarded as the father of the sage Imhotep.

==Origin and symbolism==

Ptah is an Egyptian creator god who conceived the world and brought it into being through the creative power of speech. A hymn to Ptah dating to the Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt says Ptah &quot;crafted the world in the design of his heart,&quot; and the Shabaka Stone, from the Twenty-Fifth Dynasty, says Ptah &quot;gave life to all the gods and their kas as well, through this heart and this tongue.&quot;

=== Epithets ===

He bears many epithets that describe his role in ancient Egyptian religion and its importance in society at the time:

* &quot;Ptah the begetter of the first beginning&quot;
* &quot;Ptah lord of truth&quot;
* &quot;Ptah lord of eternity&quot;
* &quot;Ptah who listens to prayers&quot;
* &quot;Ptah master of ceremonies&quot;
* &quot;Ptah master of justice&quot;
* &quot;Ptah the God who made himself to be God&quot;
* &quot;Ptah the double being&quot;
* &quot;Ptah the beautiful face&quot;

==Representations and hypostases==
Like many deities of ancient Egypt he takes many forms, through one of his particular aspects or through syncretism of ancient deities of the Memphite region. Sometimes represented as a dwarf, naked and deformed, his popularity would continue to grow during the Late Period. Frequently associated with the god Bes, his worship then moved beyond the borders of Egypt and was exported throughout the Eastern Mediterranean. Through dissemination by the Phoenicians, we find figures of Ptah in Carthage.

Ptah is generally represented in the guise of a man with green skin, contained in a shroud sticking to the skin, wearing the divine beard, and holding a sceptre combining three powerful symbols of ancient Egyptian religion:
* The &quot;Was&quot; sceptre
* The sign of life, &quot;Ankh&quot;
* The &quot;Djed&quot; pillar
These three combined symbols indicate the three creative powers of the god: power (was), life (ankh) and stability (djed).
From the Old Kingdom, he quickly absorbs the appearance of Sokar and Tatenen, ancient deities of the Memphite region. His form of Sokar is found contained in its white shroud wearing the Atef crown, an attribute of Osiris. In this capacity, he represents the patron deity of the necropolis of Saqqara and other famous sites where the royal pyramids were built. Gradually he formed with Osiris a new deity called Ptah-Sokar-Osiris. Statuettes representing the human form, the half-human, half-hawk form, or simply the pure falcon form of the new deity began to be systematically placed in tombs to accompany and protect the dead on their journey to the West.

His Tatenen form is represented by a young and vigorous man wearing a crown with two tall plumes that surround the solar disk. He thus embodies the underground fire that rumbles and raises the earth. As such, he was particularly revered by metalworkers and blacksmiths, but he was equally feared because it was he who caused earthquakes and tremors of the Earth&#x27;s crust. In this form also, Ptah is the &quot;master of ceremonies&quot; for Heb Sed, a ceremony traditionally attesting to the first thirty years of a pharaoh&#x27;s reign.

The god Ptah could correspond with the sun deities Re or Aten during the Amarna period, where he embodied the divine essence with which the sun god was fed to come into existence, that is to say to be born, according to the Memphite mythological/theological texts. In the &quot;holy of holies&quot; of his temple in Memphis, as well as in his great sacred boat, he drove in procession to regularly visit the region during major holidays. Ptah was also symbolized by two birds with human heads adorned with solar disks, symbols of the souls of the god Re: the Ba. The two Ba are identified as the twin gods Shu and Tefnut and are associated with the djed pillar of Memphis.

Finally, Ptah is embodied in the sacred bull, Apis. Frequently referred to as a &quot;herald of Re&quot;, the sacred animal is the link with the god Re from the New Kingdom. He even received worship in Memphis, probably at the heart of the great temple of Ptah, and upon the death of the animal, was buried with all the honours due to a living deity in the Serapeum of Saqqara.

Scholars have also associated Ptah with the Mandaean angel Ptahil outside of Egypt, due to their somewhat similar features and closely related names.

==Development of the cult==

The cult of the god Ptah quickly spread throughout Egypt. With the major royal projects of the Old Kingdom, the high priests of Ptah were particularly sought after and worked in concert with the vizier, filling the role of chief architects and master craftsmen, responsible for the decoration of the royal funerary complexes.

In the New Kingdom, the cult of the god would develop in different ways, especially in Memphis, his homeland, but also in Thebes, where the workers of the royal tombs honoured him as patron of craftsmen. For this reason, the oratory of &quot;Ptah who listens to prayers&quot; was built near the site of Deir el-Medina, the village where the workers and craftsmen were housed. At Memphis, the role of intercessor with humans was particularly visible in the appearance of the enclosure that protected the sanctuary of the god. Large ears were carved on the walls, symbolizing his role as &quot;god who listens to prayers&quot;.

With the Nineteenth Dynasty, his cult grew and he became one of the four great deities of the empire of Ramesses. He was worshipped at Pi-Ramesses as master of ceremonies and coronations.

With the Third Intermediate Period, Ptah returned to the centre of the monarchy where the coronation of the pharaoh was held again in his temple. The Ptolemies continued this tradition, and the high priests of Ptah were then increasingly associated with the royal family, with some even marrying princesses of royal blood, clearly indicating the prominent role they played in the Ptolemaic court.

==Legacy==
Memphis was believed to be under the protection of the god Ptah, the patron of craftsmen. Its great temple, Hut-ka-Ptah (meaning &quot;Enclosure of the ka of Ptah&quot;), was one of the most prominent structures in the city. This word entered Ancient Greek as Αἴγυπτος (&quot;Aiguptos&quot;), which entered Latin as &quot;Aegyptus&quot;, which developed into Middle French &quot;Egypte&quot; and was finally borrowed into English first as &quot;Egipte&quot; in Middle English and ultimately as &quot;Egypt&quot;.

Ptah is one of the deities mentioned in Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Aida&quot;. He is invoked in a chorus, &quot;Possente Fthà&quot; (&quot;O Mighty Ptah&quot;), in Act 1, scene 2; this chorus is reprised as &quot;Immenso Fthà&quot; (&quot;Immense Ptah&quot;), at the end of the opera as the protagonists Aida and Radamès die.

5011 Ptah is an asteroid named after the Egyptian god.

<doc id="97126" wikidata="Q301330" url="?curid=97126" title="Livia gens">
<text>The gens Livia was an illustrious plebeian family at ancient Rome. The first of the Livii to obtain the consulship was Marcus Livius Denter in 302 BC, and from his time the Livii supplied the Republic with eight consuls, two censors, a dictator, and a master of the horse. Members of the gens were honoured with three triumphs. In the reign of Augustus, Livia Drusilla was Roman empress, and her son was the emperor Tiberius.

==Origin==
History preserves no traditions concerning the origin of the Livian gens. Although its members are not found in the first two centuries of the Republic, there is nothing in particular to suggest a foreign origin. The regular cognomina of the Livii are all Latin. The nomen &quot;Livius&quot; is generally supposed to be derived from the same root as , and , all with the meaning of leaden or bluish-grey, but this connection is not absolutely certain. Pokorny dismissed this derivation, arguing that the nomen either predated these words, or could not be linguistically connected with them. He hypothesized an Etruscan origin for the Livii.

==Branches and cognomina==
The cognomina of the Livii during the Republic were &quot;Denter, Drusus, Libo, Macatus&quot;, and &quot;Salinator&quot;. Of these, &quot;Denter&quot; was a common surname originally referring to someone with prominent teeth. &quot;Macatus&quot; means &quot;spotted&quot;, being derived from the same root as &quot;macula&quot;.

&quot;Drusus&quot; probably means &quot;stiff&quot;, although Suetonius records a tradition that the first of the name received it after slaying a Gallic chieftain named &quot;Drausus&quot;. If this is the true origin of the name, then it probably dates the story to the year 283 BC, when the Senones, the Gallic people of whom Drausus was said to be the leader, were defeated and scattered, for the most part vacating northern Italy. &quot;Libo&quot;, derived from &quot;libere&quot;, designated a libation pourer, and entered the family from the Scribonia gens, one of whom was adopted by the Livii Drusi.

The surname &quot;Salinator&quot;, meaning a salt-merchant, is said to have been given in derision to Marcus Livius, who as censor in 204 BC, imposed an unpopular salt tax. A question arises from the fact that Marcus&#x27; father is also referred to as &quot;Salinator&quot;, although the historians may simply have applied the cognomen retroactively.

==Members==
===Early Livii===
* Gaius Livius, grandfather of the consul of 302 BC, may have been the magister equitum of 348.
* Lucius Livius, tribune of the plebs in 320 BC, the year after the disaster at the Caudine Forks. The consul, Albinus, had pledged himself and the other Roman magistrates as guarantors of the peace, in order to preserve the lives of the Roman army. Livius and one of his colleagues resisted the demand to turn themselves over to the Samnites as hostages, as they had nothing to do with the agreement, and moreover were sacrosanct as tribunes, the entire body of the Roman people obliged to defend them; but Postumius browbeat them until they agreed to become hostages. However, the Samnites rejected the hostages, when they realised that the Romans were bound to continue the war with or without them.
* Marcus Livius Denter, consul in 302 BC. Previously he had been one of the pontiffs chosen from the plebeians to augment the numbers of that college.

===Livii Drusi===
* Livius Drusus, according to Suetonius, a propraetor in Gaul, who defeated the chieftain Drausus in single combat, thereby earning his surname. He brought back the gold taken by the Senones as the price of departing Rome in 390 BC, thereby avenging the Gallic sack of the city. Pighius conjectures that he was the son of Marcus Livius Denter, consul in 302 BC, which would agree with the probable date of his struggle with Drausus, in 283.
* Marcus Livius M. f. Drusus Aemilianus or Mamilianus, father of the consul of 147. His agnomen suggests, but does not prove, that he was adopted from either the Aemilii or the Mamilii.
* Gaius Livius M. f. M. n. Drusus, consul in 147 BC. Either he or his son Gaius should probably be identified with the jurist of this name.
* Gaius Livius C. f. M. n. Drusus, known for his friendliness, courtesy, and persuasiveness, which he shared with his brother. Some identify him, instead of his father, as the jurist of this name.
* Marcus Livius C. f. M. n. Drusus, tribune of the plebs in 122 BC, opposed the measures of his colleague, Gaius Gracchus, and undermined his authority by proposing similar measures for which the &quot;optimates&quot;, the aristocratic party of the Senate could take credit. He was consul in 112, and perhaps triumphed over the Scordisci in the following year. He is probably the censor of 109 BC, who died during his year of office.
* Livia C. f. M. n., daughter of the consul of 147 BC. She married Publius Rutilius Rufus and became the mother of Publius Rutilius Nudus. She was noted by the Roman historians Valerius Maximus and Pliny for her longevity, both recorded that she lived to be 97.
* Marcus Livius M. f. C. n. Drusus, one of the most influential figures in Roman politics in the years leading up to the Social War. He went to great lengths to win over the Senate, espousing the party of the &quot;optimates&quot;, but then as tribune of the plebs in BC 91, he sought to conciliate the people by passing the various measures of the Gracchi. He won over the socii by promising them the rights of Roman citizenship, and passed a law to fill up the ranks of the Senate with equites. But he made a violent enemy of the consul, Lucius Marcius Philippus, who had his measures declared void &quot;ab initio&quot;. Drusus was assassinated in his house just as civil war began to break out.
* (Gaius) Livius M. f. C. n. Drusus, afterwards Mamercus Aemilius Lepidus Livianus, consul in 77 BC, was brother of the tribune Marcus and adopted into the Aemilii Lepidi. He was a supporter of Sulla&#x27;s party, the &quot;optimates&quot;, but was one of those who had persuaded Sulla to spare the life of the future dictator, Julius Caesar.
* Livia M. f. C. n., sister of the tribune, married Quintus Servilius Caepio, whose sister, Servilia, married Drusus. Caepio became her brother&#x27;s bitter opponent, and she divorced him, marrying Marcus Porcius Cato. Her sons were Gnaeus Servilius Caepio and Cato the Younger; her eldest daughter Servilia Major was the mistress of Julius Caesar as well as the mother of Brutus and mother-in-law of Cassius, the assassins of Caesar; her middle daughter was Servilia Minor the wife of Lucullus; her youngest daughter Porcia married Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus the consul of 54 BC and became the ancestress of emperor Nero.
* Livia (M. f. M. n.), a woman who expressed interest in adopting Publius Cornelius Dolabella the consul of 44 BC. She may have been a daughter of Drusus the tribune of 91 BC and Servilia.
* Marcus Livius M. f. M. n. Drusus Claudianus, born as &quot;Appius Claudius Pulcher&quot;, was adopted by one of the Livii Drusi, apparently the tribune Marcus. He was thus connected with Brutus and Cassius, two whom he allied himself after the death of Caesar. Proscribed by the triumvirs, he took his own life after the Battle of Philippi. He was the father of Livia Drusilla, Roman empress, and the grandfather of Tiberius.
* Gaius Livius (M. f. M. n. Drusus), possibly the son of Claudianus and elder brother of empress Livia. His existence can be inferred from an inscription of his daughter Livia C. f. Pulchra. He might have died before 42 as his father adopted another son before he died at the Battle of Philippi.
* Livia M. f. M. n. Drusilla, married first Tiberius Claudius Nero, and second Octavian, the future emperor Augustus. She was the mother of the emperor Tiberius, and of the general Drusus the Elder, as well as the grandmother and great-grandmother of the emperors Claudius and Caligula, both of whom she helped raise.
* Marcus Livius M. f. M. n. Drusus Libo, apparently born a member of the Scribonii Libones, and adopted by one of the Livii Drusi, generally supposed to be Claudianus, although there are several uncertain details in his relationships to the other Livii Drusi and Scribonii. He was aedile about 28 BC, and consul in 15 BC.
* Livia C. f. (M. n.) Pulchra, a woman recorded in inscription who based on her name is presumed to have been a granddaughter of Drusus Claudianus and niece of empress Livia.
* Livia M. f. M. n. &quot;Scriboniana&quot;, daughter of Marcus Livius Drusus Libo and mother of Livia Medullina, the fiancee of the young Claudius who died before they could be married.
* Lucius Scribonius Libo Drusus, generally supposed to be the son (or grandson) of Marcus Livius Drusus Libo, was induced by the Senator and delator Firmius Catus to consult soothsayers with respect to his chances of attaining the empire. At first the accusations were ignored by Tiberius, but then he was brought to trial and, finding no hope of vindication, he took his own life.

===Livii Salinatores===
* Marcus Livius M. f. M. n. (Salinator), father of the consul, was decemvir sacris faciundis in 236 BC. Either he or perhaps his son purchased an educated Greek, named &quot;Andronicus&quot;, as a tutor for his children; once freed, Andronicus became the founder of Roman drama.
* Marcus Livius M. f. M. n. Salinator, was consul during the Second Illyrian War, and despite triumphing over the enemy, he was afterward charged with misappropriating the spoils of war, and sent into exile. During the Second Punic War he was induced to return and resume his seat in the Senate, although he rarely spoke, except to speak on behalf of his kinsman, Marcus Livius Macatus. Consul for the second time in 207, he and his colleague, Gaius Claudius Nero, defeated and slew Hasdrubal, the brother of Hannibal, before the two could unite their forces, and he triumphed for the second time. He was appointed dictator the following year to host the elections, and censor in 204, but he and his colleague quarreled severely. He may have been the adoptive father of Marcus Livius Drusus Aemilianus.
* Gaius Livius M. f. M. n. Salinator, praetor in 202 BC, and again in 191, when he had command of the fleet in the War against Antiochus, and defeated the Seleucid admiral, Polyxenidas. He was consul in 188.
* Lucius (Livius) Salinator, a supporter of Sertorius in Spain, was betrayed and murdered in 81 BC while trying to hold the Pyrenees against a hostile army.

===Livii Ocellae===
* Lucius Livius Ocella, pardoned by Caesar at Thapsus.
* Lucius Livius L. f. Ocella, quaestor in Spain in 42 BC, was the step-grandfather of the emperor Galba.
* Servius Livius (L. f.) Ocella, a senator in 50 BC, was likely a brother of the quaestor Lucius Ocella.
* Gaius Livius L. f. Ocella, a resident of Vescia, might possibly be identified with Lucius Ocella the quaestor, but Broughton believed them to be separate people.
* Livia L. f. L. n. Ocellina, the step-mother (and possibly adoptive mother) of Galba.
* Lucius Livius Ocella Sulpicius Galba, better known as Servius Sulpicius Galba, emperor from AD 68 to 69.

===Others===
* Lucius Livius Andronicus, originally an educated but enslaved Greek named &quot;Andronicus&quot;, he was purchased by a Marcus Livius Salinator as a tutor for his children. On his manumission, he assumed the name &quot;Lucius Livius Andronicus&quot;. He was a renowned poet, and the founder of Roman drama.
* Marcus Livius, member of the plenipotentiary board sent to Carthage after the fall of Saguntum in 219 BC to inquire if Hannibal&#x27;s attack on it had been authorized and declare war if Hannibal could not be brought to justice. He was married to the daughter of Pacuvius Calavius, chief magistrate of Capua in 217 BC. Pacuvius was a patrician who had married a daughter of Appius Claudius.
* Marcus Livius Macatus, placed by the propraetor Marcus Valerius Laevinus in charge of the garrison at Tarentum in 214 BC, during the Second Punic War. When the town was lost to a surprise attack in 212, Livius and his soldiers retreated to the citadel, where they held out until the city was retaken by Quintus Fabius Maximus in 209. On the question of whether Livius should be punished or rewarded for his conduct, Fabius replied that he could not have recaptured Tarentum but for Livius&#x27; actions.
* Gaius Livius, minted coins of Vesci in Baetica and was possibly legate in 40 BC under Octavian and Mark Antony.
* Gaius Livius, possibly the father of the historian.
* Titus Livius, the historian Livy, flourished during the last decades of the Republic, and through the reign of Augustus. He wrote nothing of his family, and other historians have contributed only that he was from Patavium, and that he had at least one son, and a daughter who married a certain Lucius Magius. Two inscriptions from Patavium in the &quot;Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum&quot; are thought to mark the resting place of Livy and several members of his family.
* Titus Livius T. f. Priscus, thought to be the historian&#x27;s elder son.
* Titus Livius T. f. Longus, perhaps the historian&#x27;s younger son.
* Livia T. f. Quarta, perhaps a daughter of the historian. If she is the same daughter who married Lucius Magius, there is no indication of it on her monument.
* Titus Livius Liviae Quartae l. Halys, freedman of Livia Quarta. His funeral plaque was unearthed at the monastery of St. Justina at Padua in 1360, followed in 1413 by the excavation of a lead coffin in the same location, containing a human skeleton. Owing to a misunderstanding of the tablet&#x27;s inscription, the remains were supposed to belong to the historian, rather than a freedman, until further excavations at Padua explained the inscription&#x27;s true meaning.

==Later uses==
* In European languages, Livia is still an ordinary girls&#x27; name. In Romanian, the form is &quot;Liviu&quot;. 
* The town of Forlì in Emilia-Romagna, Italy, is named after Livius Salinator, its legendary founder. The original name was &quot;Forum Livii&quot;.

<doc id="97130" wikidata="Q5505803" url="?curid=97130" title="Front Page Challenge">
<text>Front Page Challenge was a Canadian panel game about current events and history. Created by comedy writer/performer John Aylesworth (of the comedy team of Frank Peppiatt and John Aylesworth) and produced and aired by CBC Television, the series ran from 1957 to 1995.

==Synopsis==
The series featured notable journalists attempting to guess the recent or old news story with which a hidden guest challenger was linked by asking him or her questions, in much the same manner as the American quiz shows, &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. Each round of the game started with news footage that introduced the story in question to the studio audience and home viewers out of earshot of the panellists. After the guest was identified and/or the news story determined, the journalists then interviewed the guest about the story or about achievements or experiences for which he or she was known. Unlike American quiz shows that steered clear of controversy in the 1950s and 1960s, &quot;Front Page Challenge&quot; seems to have been affected by just one censorship practice, that of avoiding four-letter words.

Guests came from all walks of life, including politicians like Pierre Trudeau and Indira Gandhi, activists like Malcolm X, sports figures like Gordie Howe, entertainers like Boris Karloff and Ed Sullivan, and writers like Upton Sinclair. From 1957 to 1979, the show featured many non-Canadians whose trips to Canada were paid by the CBC. (Gandhi was even flown from India to Toronto in the 1960s at the CBC&#x27;s expense.) Occasionally, guests were featured for their involvement in stories that had nothing to do with their celebrity status. For example, in 1958 Karloff was featured because he had served as a rescue worker in the aftermath of a devastating 1912 tornado in Regina, Saskatchewan, where he had been appearing in a play many years before horror films made him famous.

Jayne Mansfield appeared on the Tuesday night telecast of 12 December 1961 representing the victories two years earlier of British prime minister Harold Macmillan and his Conservative Party in the 1959 United Kingdom general election. The American actress, whose high IQ was well-publicized, was filming a movie in the United Kingdom in 1959 when she and others connected with the movie read and heard about the election results. The CBC archive has two photographs of Mansfield during her 1961 visit to the Toronto television studio where &quot;Front Page Challenge&quot; always originated during that era, but the videotape of her episode was lost due to wiping.

Occasionally, the challenger on &quot;Front Page Challenge&quot; was one of the panellists themselves, unbeknownst to the other three panellists. After the game, the relevant person simply moved to the guest seat for the interview.

The show ran for nearly 40 years and featured a remarkably stable cast of panellists, including journalist-historian Pierre Berton, Betty Kennedy (who later become a Canadian senator), Toby Robins (who later became a movie actress) and radio commentator Gordon Sinclair. Columnist Allan Fotheringham joined the panel after Sinclair&#x27;s death. A guest panellist, usually another Canadian journalist, politician or other celebrity, was also part of each episode. In 1990, journalist and radio/TV personality Jack Webster joined the show as its permanent fourth panellist.

For its initial summer 1957 run, the show was hosted by Win Barron, best known for his voice-over narration of newsreels produced by the Canadian division of Paramount Pictures. However, Barron proved ill at ease in the moderator&#x27;s seat, so both Fred Davis and panellist Alex Barris rotated as guest hosts in the early part of the fall before Davis was chosen to take over as host full-time (a position he retained for the rest of the show&#x27;s run), though Barris continued to appear as a guest panellist occasionally and was the show&#x27;s writer for the duration of its run. In 1981, the CBC published an oversized book written by Barris about the history of the program. It was titled &quot;Front Page Challenge: The 25th Anniversary&quot;. Four years after the show&#x27;s cancellation, another book by Barris was published chronicling the last fifteen years of the show. It included more details and anecdotes about the show&#x27;s earlier phases not found in his first book.

Several weeks after its debut, &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; television columnist Bob Blackburn deemed the programme to be noticeably improved and predicted that if that trend continued &quot;and if the program doesn&#x27;t run dry on its slightly limited subject matter, &quot;Front Page Challenge&quot; might well become an institution on Canadian TV&quot;.

In his book, Barris says that at the height of the show&#x27;s popularity in the late 1950s, the individual panellists became major celebrities in Canada. He relates how Toby Robins, a beautiful brunette, donned a blonde wig for a few episodes as an experiment, attracting hate mail including a death threat over the change of appearance. The books also include journalist Barbara Frum&#x27;s remarks about how influential Robins was for 1950s-era female equality through her decision to appear on the program while pregnant.

The show&#x27;s stability proved to be its undoing, as the producers did not see fit to add younger panellists while the regulars aged and the audience demographics became less desirable. The show always was videotaped in or aired live from Toronto prior to 1966. During that year four shows originated from Montreal including one with challenger Jessica Mitford. The show continued going on the road, being videotaped in cities across Canada. The oldest regular, Gordon Sinclair, continued travelling with his fellow panellists to videotaping locations until he was well into his 80s. Although the location of the studio was not always noticeable to home viewers, they did notice the lack of guest challengers from foreign countries after 1979. The program no longer featured internationally known controversial figures to match the likes of Timothy Leary, Indira Gandhi, Menachem Begin (when he was a Knesset member) and William F. Buckley who had held viewers&#x27; attention in the 1960s and most of the 1970s. Alex Barris says in his second book that the absence of non-Canadian guests after 1979 resulted from budget cuts for CBC Television that ruled out travel expenses.

Barris also claims that the advent of multiple cable channels in the 1980s and early 1990s (in cities, towns and rural areas near the border of the United States where people could receive programming from both countries) presented another challenge to the staff of &quot;Front Page Challenge&quot; and contributed to its demise. Prior to the 1980s when there were no 24-hour news channels competing with &quot;Front Page Challenge&quot;, each round of the game began with silent black-and-white newsreel footage of the news story in question while a narrator, not heard by the panellists, summarized it. Even after the segments started including colour videotape, the only voice heard introducing the topical issue and the challenger was the voice of the narrator of &quot;Front Page Challenge&quot;.

Producers continued to use the same off-screen narrator,
which made the &quot;Front Page Challenge&quot; footage less appealing to young people than the multiple sound bites featured by CBC Newsworld, which began 24-hour newscasts throughout Canada on 31 July 1989. CBC Newsworld offered sound bite interviews with people who had witnessed events or were knowledgeable about them. Young viewers using remote controls stuck with the multiple sound bites and ignored the &quot;Front Page Challenge&quot; narrator&#x27;s summaries of the news stories, according to the book by Alex Barris published in 1999. As the pace of 1980s news quickened, even before the launch of CBC Newsworld, Fred Davis, Betty Kennedy and Pierre Berton obviously remained mentally sharp enough to follow all of it, but they had not witnessed 99 percent of the events about which they were so curious. Young viewers in the 1980s were accustomed to listening to people who had witnessed current events or had made them happen.

When &quot;Front Page Challenge&quot; ceased production in 1995, it was the longest continually running non-news program in Canadian television history. Among the contestants on the final show was then-emerging country music superstar Shania Twain.

==Episode status==
Reruns of the program were broadcast by Canadian cable channel History Television (now simply called History) in the late 1990s. At least a few of the episodes from the 1950s and 1960s were not saved. In his second book about the program, Alex Barris tells an anecdote about what guest panellist Bennett Cerf said to challenger Jesse Owens about Adolf Hitler during a 1958 episode. The CBC archive has a clip that lasts less than one minute in which Cerf and Owens have this exchange, but the rest of the episode does not survive.

1960s episodes that featured Menachem Begin, then a Knesset member, Jayne Mansfield, William F. Buckley, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and Timothy Leary were lost in their entirety.

<text>Five Points (or The Five Points) was a 19th-century neighborhood in Lower Manhattan, New York City. The neighborhood, partly built on low-lying land which had filled in the freshwater lake known as the Collect Pond, was generally defined as being bound by Centre Street to the west, the Bowery to the east, Canal Street to the north, and Park Row to the south. The Five Points gained international notoriety as a densely populated, disease-ridden, crime-infested slum which existed for over 70 years.

Through the 20th century, the former Five Points area was gradually redeveloped, with streets changed or closed. The area is now occupied by the Civic Center to the west and south, which includes major federal, state, and city facilities. To the east and north, the former Five Points neighborhood is now part of Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown.

==Name==
Two crossing streets and a third that ends at their intersection form five corners, or &quot;points&quot;. About 1809, Anthony Street was extended east to the junction of Cross and Orange streets. As a result, the surrounding neighborhood came to be called Five Points. In 1854, the three streets were renamed from Anthony Street to Worth Street, Orange Street to Baxter Street, and Cross Street to Park Street. In 1868, Worth Street was again extended eastward, from the five-pointed intersection to Chatham Square, adding a sixth point. Since then, Baxter (formerly Orange) has been eliminated south of the intersection and Park (formerly Cross) has been eliminated on both sides of it; thus, the junction of Baxter and Worth remaining today has only two corners. Also, what remained of Park Street was renamed to Mosco Street in 1982.

==Collect Pond==



For the first two centuries of European settlement in Manhattan, the main source of drinking water for the growing city was Collect Pond, or Fresh Water Pond, which also supplied abundant fish.

The pond occupied approximately and was as deep as . Fed by an underground spring, it was located in a valley, with Bayard&#x27;s Mount (at , the tallest hill in lower Manhattan) to the northeast. A stream flowed north out of the pond and then west through a salt marsh (which, after being drained, became a meadow by the name of &quot;Lispenard Meadows&quot;) to the Hudson River, while another stream issued from the southeastern part of the pond in an easterly direction to the East River. In the 18th century, the pond was used as a picnic area during summer and a skating rink during the winter.

Beginning in the early 18th century, various commercial enterprises were built along the shores of the pond in order to use the water. These businesses included Coulthards Brewery, Nicholas Bayard&#x27;s slaughterhouse on Mulberry Street (which was nicknamed &quot;Slaughterhouse Street&quot;), numerous tanneries on the southeastern shore, and the pottery works of German immigrants Johan Willem Crolius and Johan Remmey on Pot Bakers Hill on the south-southwestern shore. The contaminated wastewater of the businesses surrounding the pond flowed back into the pond, creating a severe pollution problem and environmental health hazard.

Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant proposed cleaning the pond and making it a centerpiece of a recreational park, around which the residential areas of the city could grow. His proposal was rejected, and it was decided to fill in the pond. The landfill was completed in 1811, and middle class homes were soon built on the reclaimed land.

The landfill was poorly engineered. The buried vegetation began to release methane gas (a byproduct of decomposition) and the area, in a natural depression, lacked adequate storm sewers. As a result, the ground gradually subsided. Houses shifted on their foundations, the unpaved streets were often buried in a foot of mud mixed with human and animal excrement, and mosquitoes bred in the stagnant pools created by the poor drainage.

Most middle and upper class inhabitants fled the area, leaving the neighborhood open to poor immigrants who began arriving in the early 1820s. This influx reached a height in the 1840s, with large numbers of Irish Catholics fleeing the Great Famine.

==Slum==
At the height of Five Points&#x27; inhabitation, only parts of London&#x27;s East End were equivalent in the western world for population density, child and infant mortality, disease, violent crime, unemployment, prostitution, and other classic problems of the urban destitute. It is sometimes considered the original American melting pot, at first consisting primarily of newly emancipated Black Americans (gradual emancipation led to the end of outright enslavement in New York on July 4, 1827) and ethnic Irish, who had a small minority presence in the area since the 1600s. The local politics of &quot;the Old Sixth ward&quot; (The Points&#x27; primary municipal voting district), while not free of corruption, set important precedents for the election of Catholics to key political offices. Before that time, New York, and the United States at large, had been governed by the Anglo-Protestant founders. Although there were many tensions between Black Americans and the Irish, their cohabitation in Five Points was the first large-scale instance of voluntary racial integration in American history. Gradually, this African-American community moved to Manhattan&#x27;s West Side and to undeveloped lands on the north end of the island in Harlem by the early 20th century and across the Harlem River into the South Bronx, as the city developed northward.

Five Points is alleged to have had the highest murder rate of any slum at that time in the world. According to an old New York urban legend, the Old Brewery, formerly Coulthard&#x27;s Brewery from the 1790s, then an overcrowded tenement on Cross Street housing 1,000 poor, is said to have had a murder a night for 15 years, until its demolition in 1852.

Italians first settled in the Five Points in the 1850s. The parish of the Church of the Transfiguration at 25 Mott Street was largely Italian by the 1880s. Mulberry Bend, named for the curve in Mulberry Street in the Chatham District, became the heart of Little Italy, which at its most populated was bordered on the south by Worth Street, on the east by the Bowery, and on the west by West Broadway.

&quot;Almack&#x27;s&quot; (also known as &quot;Pete Williams&#x27;s Place&quot;), an African American-owned dance hall located at 67 Orange Street in Mulberry Bend (today Baxter Street), just south of its intersection with Bayard Street, was home to a fusion of Irish reels and jigs with the African shuffle. Though different ethnic groups interacted in other parts of the United States as well, creating new dance and music forms, in New York this music and dance had spontaneously resulted on the street from competition between African-American and Irish musicians and dancers. It spilled into Almack&#x27;s, where it gave rise in the short term to tap dance (see Master Juba) and in the long term to a music hall genre that was a major precursor to jazz and rock and roll. This ground is now Columbus Park.

==Infectious diseases==
Infectious diseases, such as cholera, tuberculosis, typhus, and malaria and yellow fever, had plagued New York City since the Dutch colonial era. The lack of scientific knowledge, sanitation systems, the numerous overcrowded dwellings, and absence of even rudimentary health care made impoverished areas such as Five Points ideal for the development and spread of these diseases. Several epidemics swept the City of New York in the 18th and 19th centuries, some of which originated in Five Points. Others were introduced by passengers disembarking from ships from overseas, including immigrants. In June 1832, an outbreak of cholera in Five Points spread rapidly throughout the crowded, unsanitary dwellings of the neighborhood before spreading to the rest of New York City. With no understanding of disease vectors or transmission, some observers believed that these epidemics were due to the immorality of residents of the slum:

Every day&#x27;s experience gives us assurance of the safety of the temperate and prudent, who are in circumstances of comfort …. The disease is now, more than before rioting in the haunts of infamy and pollution. A prostitute at 62 Mott Street, who was decking herself before the glass at 1 o&#x27;clock yesterday, was carried away in a hearse at half past three o&#x27;clock. The broken down constitutions of these miserable creatures, perish almost instantly on the attack …. But the business part of our population, in general, appear to be in perfect health and security.
—&quot;New-York Mercury&quot;, July 18, 1832

==Riots==
The Anti-abolitionist riots of 1834, also known as the Farren Riots, occurred in New York City over a series of four nights, beginning July 7, 1834. Their deeper origins lay in the combination of nativism and abolitionism among Protestants, who had controlled the city since the American Revolution, and the fear and resentment of blacks among the growing numbers of Irish immigrants, who competed with them for jobs and housing.

In 1827, Great Britain repealed legislation controlling and restricting emigration from Ireland, and 20,000 Irish emigrated. By 1835, more than 30,000 Irish had arrived in New York annually. Among the casualties of the riots was St. Philip&#x27;s Episcopal Church, the first black Episcopal church in the city, then located at 122 Centre Street. It was sacked and looted by the mostly ethnic Irish mob.

The media designated a branch of the &quot;Roach Guards&quot;, a violent Irish gang, &quot;Dead Rabbits&quot;. 
The Dead Rabbits Riot began when one faction destroyed the headquarters of the Bowery Boys at 26 Bowery, on July 4, 1857. The Bowery Boys retaliated, which led to a large-scale riot which raged back and forth on Bayard Street, between Bowery and Mulberry Street. Rioting resumed on July 5. The Bowery Boys and the Dead Rabbits fought again in front of 40 and 42 Bowery Street (original buildings still extant in May 2017), erecting barricades in the street. On July 6 the Bowery Boys fought the Kerryonians (Irishmen from County Kerry) at Anthony and Centre Street. Historian Tyler Anbinder says the &quot;dead rabbits&quot; name &quot;so captured the imagination of New Yorkers that the press continued to use it despite the abundant evidence that no such club or gang existed&quot;. Anbinder notes that, &quot;for more than a decade, &#x27;Dead Rabbit&#x27; became the standard phrase by which city residents described any scandalously riotous individual or group.&quot;

As residents took advantage of the disorganized state of the city&#x27;s police force, brought about by the conflict between the Municipal and Metropolitan police, gangsters and other criminals from all parts of the city began to engage in widespread looting and the destruction of property. The &quot;Daily National Intelligencer&quot; of July 8, 1857, estimated that between 800 and 1,000 gang members took part in the riots, along with several hundred others who used the disturbance to loot the Bowery area. It was the largest disturbance since the Astor Place Riot in 1849. Order was restored by the New York State Militia (under Major-General Charles W. Sandford), supported by detachments of city police. Eight people were reported killed, and more than 100 people received serious injuries.

==Social reform and renewal==
Various efforts by different charitable organizations and individuals, most of them Christian, attempted to alleviate the suffering of the poor in Five Points. Padre Felix Varela, a Cuban-born priest, established a Roman Catholic parish at the former Episcopalian Christ Church on Ann Street in 1827, to minister to the poor Irish Catholics. In 1836, Father Varela&#x27;s parish was divided into two parishes, with one on James Street dedicated to St. James, and second one housed in a former Presbyterian church on Chambers Street, which was renamed the Church of the Transfiguration. In 1853, the parish relocated to the corner of Mott and Cross streets, when they purchased the building of the Zion Protestant Episcopal Church (c.1801) from its congregation, which moved uptown.

The first call for clearing the slums of Five Points through wholesale demolition came in 1829 from merchants who maintained businesses in close proximity to the neighborhood. Slum clearance efforts (promoted in particular by Jacob Riis, author of &quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot;, published 1890), succeeded in razing part of Mulberry Bend off Mulberry Street, one of the worst sections of the Five Points neighborhood. It was redeveloped as a park designed by noted landscape architect Calvert Vaux and named Mulberry Bend Park at its opening in 1897; it is now known as Columbus Park.

A major effort was made to clear the Old Brewery on Cross Street, described as &quot;a vast dark cave, a black hole into which every urban nightmare and unspeakable fear could be projected.&quot; The Old Brewery had formerly been Coulthard&#x27;s Brewery, which was located on the outskirts of the town less than thirty years earlier in the 1790s. Later enveloped by the growing city, it was located on Cross Street just south of the Five Points intersection. The brewery became known as the &quot;Old Brewery&quot; after being converted to a tenement / boarding house in 1837. Its lower, high-ceilinged floor and the above two floors were converted into four floors of rundown apartments. The rent was cheap and attracted many low-income tenants, many of them immigrants. The only census record taken in 1850 reported 221 people living in 35 apartments, averaging 6.3 persons per apartment. Accounts conflict as to the total number of people living in the Brewery flats, but all agreed that it was well over capacity.

The poverty seen throughout the Five Points was also displayed at the Old Brewery, and the women of the Home Mission took action. This Methodist charity group was determined to clean up Five Points. The &quot;Christian Advocate&quot;, also called &quot;The Christian Advocate and Journal&quot;, a weekly New York newspaper published by the Methodist Episcopal Church, reported on the ongoing project in October 1853:

In a meeting held in , in December 1851, such convincing proof was given of the public interest in this project, that the resolution was passed by the Executive Committee to purchase the Old Brewery. Other appeals were made to the public, and nobly met. That celebrated haunt was purchased, in a few months utterly demolished, and already a noble missionary building occupies its site.

The New Mission House replaced the Old Brewery, under the direction of the Five Points Mission. It provided housing, clothes, food, and education as part of the charitable endeavor. The new building had 58 rooms available for living space, twenty-three more than the Old Brewery.

==The area today==
The area formerly occupied by Five Points was gradually redeveloped through the twentieth century. In the west and south, it is occupied by major federal, state, and city administration buildings and courthouses known collectively as Civic Center, Manhattan. In addition Columbus Park, Collect Pond Park, Foley Square, and various facilities of the New York City Department of Correction are clustered around lower Centre Street. The Tombs jail/prison, in which many criminals from Five Points were incarcerated and quite a few executed, stood near the site of the City Prison Manhattan at 125 White Street; the latter prison stood on the site until 2023. The northeastern and eastern portion of Five Points is now within the sprawling Chinatown. Many tenement buildings dating from the late 19th century still line the streets in this area.

Since 2021, the intersection of Worth and Baxter streets has been co-named &quot;Five Points&quot;, a reference to the former neighborhood.

<text>The Universe Championships are annual worldwide bodybuilding events organised by the British National Amateur Body-Builders&#x27; Association (NABBA). Originally promoted as the contest, the event was expanded to include women&#x27;s classes in 1968. Notable previous winners include bodybuilder, actor, and former governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, and bodybuilder and actor Steve Reeves (1926–2000).

The Universe Championships includes the following classes:
==History==
In 1948, David Johnston, then editor of Strength and Health magazine, and his team organised the Mr. Universe contest in London to coincide with the Olympic Games. The event drew great attention from bodybuilders and the general public who packed the Scala Theatre to see the spectacle. John Grimek earned the inaugural title with Steve Reeves placing second. Reeves eventually found his way to the microphone to declare, &quot;I think that John Grimek is the greatest bodybuilder who ever lived!&quot;

While there was no contest held in 1949, behind the scenes, members of the Strength and Health League were arranging the formation of the National Amateur Body-Builders&#x27; Association or NABBA. NABBA announced that it would be hosting the Mr Universe contest again in 1950. Steve Reeves returned to England to be crowned champion that year. Despite being the first NABBA Mr Universe, Steve Reeves was not chosen as the silhouette for the NABBA logo. That distinction would go to John Grimek and his likeness is still used to this day as the emblem of the association.

When Oscar Heidenstam became the NABBA Secretary in 1955, after a highly successful competitive career, he quickly became the main driving force of not only NABBA but also the Mr Universe contest. Around the same time, a network of area shows in the UK was established to increase membership.

In 1957, the Guadeloupan-French bodybuilder Arthur Robin became the first Black man to win the Mr Universe title.

The early success of the Mr Universe was underpinned by the support of many of the big names taking part such as John Grimek, Steve Reeves, Reg Park and Bill Pearl. Into the 1960s and 1970s the Mr Universe also became the launching pad for many of the famous bodybuilders of the day such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Lou Ferrigno, Serge Nubret and many others.

These were the most influential champions, who not only took part, but encouraged others in America and Europe to support the Universe. Their inspiration still encourages many young bodybuilders today.

While the contest was initially only for amateur male bodybuilders, a professional class was added in 1952. The NABBA UK Constitution traditionally defines an amateur as someone who has &quot;never entered and accepted prize money in an advertised professional event.&quot; Today NABBA International, the worldwide governing body, offers Pro Cards to the four male height class winners at the Universe Championships and the NABBA World Championships. Between 2011 and 2013 there was no professional Mr. Universe class held as interest had diminished. In 2013 however, following a seven-year absence from competition, Lee Priest returned and won the overall title as an amateur. Following his victory, the NABBA International Council determined that in 2014 the NABBA Professional Division would be reestablished with the inaugural professional contest being the 2014 NABBA World Championships in Belfast, Northern Ireland. In 2014, Dave Titterton won the Professional Mr Universe title in Southport, England.

Women&#x27;s bodybuilding classes were included from 1968 as Ms Physique and then divided in 1986 into Ms Physique and Ms Figure. The Ms Physique class was discontinued from 2010 at the Universe Championships, however Miss Trained, Athletic, and Toned Figures are now offered.

In 1985, a Junior Mr Universe class was included for men under 21 years. The class was discontinued between 1990 and 1999 but returned in 2000.

In 1991, a Masters Over 40 class was introduced. The inaugural winner was Graeme Lancefield from Australia, narrowly beating NABBA legend John Citrone for the title. A Masters Over 50 class was introduced in 2002 with Mr Universe veteran Ian Lawrence from Scotland capturing the new award.

The NABBA Universe Championships is conducted under the auspices of NABBA UK and its chairman Jim Charles.

A separate competition called &quot;IFBB Mr. Universe&quot; was organized by the IFBB however, its name was changed to the World Amateur Bodybuilding Championships in 1976.

Mr. Universe should not be confused with Mr. Olympia, which began in 1965.

==Judging==

The athletes are judged on their symmetry, proportions and the size and clarity of each muscle group. Most of the judging occurs during the day (this is called the pre-judging) before the evening show, the finals.

<text>A slide whistle (variously known as a swanee or swannee whistle, lotus flute, piston flute, or jazz flute) is a wind instrument consisting of a fipple like a recorder&#x27;s and a tube with a piston in it. Thus it has an air reed like some woodwinds, but varies the pitch with a slide. The construction is rather like a bicycle pump. Because the air column is cylindrical and open at one end and closed at the other, it overblows the third harmonic. &quot;A whistle made out of a long tube with a slide at one end. An ascending and descending glissando is produced by moving the slide back and forth while blowing into the mouthpiece.&quot; &quot;Tubular whistle with a plunger unit in its column, approximately 12 inches long. The pitch is changed by moving the slide plunger in and out, producing ascending and descending glisses.&quot;

== History ==
Piston flutes, in folk versions usually made of cane or bamboo, existed in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as well as Europe before the modern version was invented in England in the nineteenth century. The latter, which may be more precisely referred to as the slide or Swanee whistle, is commonly made of plastic or metal.

The modern slide whistle is familiar as a sound effect (as in animated cartoon sound tracks, when a glissando can suggest something rapidly ascending or falling, or when a player hits a &quot;Bankrupt&quot; on &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;), but it is also possible to play melodies on a slide whistle.

The swanee whistle dates back at least to the 1840s, when it was manufactured by the Distin family and featured in their concerts in England. Early slide whistles were also made by the English J Stevens &amp; Son and H A Ward. By the 1920s the slide whistle was common in the US, and was occasionally used in popular music and jazz as a special effect. For example, it was used on Paul Whiteman&#x27;s early hit recording of &quot;Whispering&quot; (1920). Even Louis Armstrong switched over from his more usual cornet to the slide whistle for a chorus on a couple of recordings with King Oliver&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band, such as &quot;Sobbin&#x27; Blues&quot; (1923). At that time, slide saxophones, with reeds rather than a fipple, were also built. The whistle was also widely used in Jug band music of the 1920s such as Whistler&#x27;s Jug Band. Gavin Gordon uses a slide whistle in his ballet &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1935).

== Uses ==

The slide whistle is often thought of as a toy instrument, especially in the West, though it has been and still is used in various forms of &quot;serious&quot; music. Its first appearance in notated European classical music may have been when Maurice Ravel called for one in his opera &quot;L&#x27;enfant et les sortilèges&quot;. More modern uses in classical music include Paul Hindemith&#x27;s Kammermusik No. 1, op. 24 no. 1 (1922), Luciano Berio&#x27;s &quot;Passaggio&quot;, which uses five, and the Violin Concerto of György Ligeti, as well as pieces by Cornelius Cardew, Alberto Ginastera, Hans Werner Henze, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Krzysztof Penderecki (&quot;De Natura Sonoris II&quot;, 1971). John Cage&#x27;s &quot;Music of Changes&quot; (1951) and &quot;Water Music&quot; (1952) both feature slide whistle and duck calls. The slide whistle is also used in many of the works of P. D. Q. Bach.

In the 1930s through the 1950s it was played with great dexterity by Paul &#x27;Hezzie&#x27; Trietsch, one of the founding members of the Hoosier Hot Shots. They made many recordings.

Roger Waters played two notes on the slide whistle in the song &quot;Flaming&quot;, from Pink Floyd&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;.

A more recent appearance of the slide whistle can be heard in the 1979 song &quot;Get Up&quot; by Vernon Burch. The slide whistle segment of this song was later sampled by Deee-Lite in their 1990 hit &quot;Groove Is in the Heart&quot;.
Fred Schneider of The B-52&#x27;s plays a plastic toy slide whistle in live performances of the song &quot;Party Out of Bounds&quot; as a prop for the song&#x27;s drunken partygoer theme, in place of the trumpet thus used in the studio for the &quot;Wild Planet&quot; song.

On the popular BBC Radio 4 comedy panel game show &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t A Clue&quot; the swanee whistle has been paired for comic effect with the kazoo in a musical round called &quot;Swanee-Kazoo&quot; which has been played for over forty years.

In September 2024, Spelling was announced as one of the celebrities competing on season 33 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. She is partnered with Pasha Pashkov.

==Personal life==
On July 3, 2004, Spelling married actor and writer Charlie Shanian. In July 2005, she was filming the Lifetime TV movie &quot;Mind Over Murder&quot; in Ottawa, during which she met actor Dean McDermott, who was then married to actress Mary Jo Eustace. Spelling and McDermott began an affair the night they met. They separated in October 2005. Shanian cited irreconcilable differences when he filed for divorce, which was finalized on April 20, 2006.

Spelling married McDermott less than a month later, on May 7, 2006, in a private ceremony in Wakaya, Fiji. The couple renewed their vows on May 8, 2010, in Beverly Hills, California. They have five children together: three sons, Liam Aaron (born 2007), Finn Davey (born 2012) and Beau Dean (born 2017) and two daughters, Stella Doreen (born 2008) and Hattie Margaret (born 2011).

Spelling anticipated a sizable inheritance from her father&#x27;s $500 million estate after his death in 2006. The estate was to be divided primarily between Spelling, her brother Randy, and their mother Candy. Candy Spelling was the estate executor, but she and Tori Spelling were estranged. Tori and Randy Spelling each inherited $800,000, although Randy was not estranged from Candy. Candy established a $10 million trust fund for Tori&#x27;s eldest child.

In her sixth book, &quot;Spelling It Like It Is&quot;, Spelling admitted to having financial troubles, due to the cancellation of her reality series, poor real estate decisions, and a difficult fourth pregnancy, during which she was hospitalized for ten weeks. In explanation, Spelling said, &quot;...as my real estate obsession persists, it&#x27;s starting to look more compulsive. Moving is expensive, and I&#x27;ve put us in a precarious financial situation.&quot;

In December 2013, after welcoming their second son, &quot;Us Weekly&quot; broke the news that McDermott was unfaithful to Spelling. The couple worked through the aftermath of the affair on a Lifetime series titled &quot;True Tori&quot;.

While Spelling and McDermott&#x27;s marriage was back on track, the couple once again made headlines in 2016 for owing $39,000 to American Express in unpaid credit card bills. Candy, who was on good terms with her daughter, told TMZ at the time that she was helping out Spelling and her family financially.

In June 2023, McDermott announced that he and Spelling decided to separate after 18 years together in a now-deleted Instagram post.

On March 29, 2024, Spelling officially filed for divorce from McDermott, citing irreconcilable differences and asking for sole physical and joint legal custody of their five children with visitation rights for McDermott.

<doc id="97150" wikidata="Q48298" url="?curid=97150" title="Shofar">
<text>A shofar ( ; from , ) is an ancient musical horn typically made of a ram&#x27;s horn, used for Jewish ritual purposes. Like the modern bugle, the shofar lacks pitch-altering devices, with all pitch control done by varying the player&#x27;s embouchure. The shofar is blown in synagogue services on Rosh Hashanah and at the end of Yom Kippur; it is also blown every weekday morning in the month of Elul running up to Rosh Hashanah. Shofars come in a variety of sizes and shapes, depending on the choice of animal and level of finish.

== Bible and rabbinic literature ==

The shofar is mentioned frequently in the Hebrew Bible, the Talmud and rabbinic literature. In the first instance, in , the blast of a shofar emanating from the thick cloud on Mount Sinai makes the Israelites tremble in awe.

The shofar was used to announce the new moon and the Jubilee year. The first day of Tishrei (now known as Rosh Hashana) is termed a &quot;memorial of blowing&quot;, or &quot;day of blowing&quot;, the shofar. Shofars were used for signifying the start of a war. They were also employed in processions as musical accompaniment, and were inserted into the temple orchestra by David. Note that the &quot;trumpets&quot; described in Numbers 10 are a different instrument, described by the Hebrew word for &#x27;trumpet&#x27; (), not ().

In the Temple in Jerusalem, the shofar was sometimes used together with the trumpet. On Rosh Hashana, the principal ceremony was conducted with the shofar, with the instrument placed in the center with a trumpet on either side; it was the horn of a ibex (a type of wild goat) and straight in shape, being ornamented with gold at the mouthpiece. On fast days, the principal ceremony was conducted with the trumpets in the center and with a shofar on either side. On those occasions, the shofarot were rams&#x27; horns curved in shape and ornamented with silver at the mouthpieces.

On Yom Kippur of the jubilee year, the ceremony was performed with the shofar as on New Year&#x27;s Day. Shofar first indicated in Yovel (Jubilee Year—Lev. 25:8–13). Indeed, in Rosh Hashanah 33b, the sages ask why the Shofar sounded in Jubilee year. Rosh Hashanah 29a indicates that in ordinary years both Shofars and trumpets are sounded but in the Jubilee Year only the Shofar blasts. The Rabbis created the practice of the Shofar&#x27;s sounding every Yom Kippur rather than just on the Jubilee Year (once in 50 years).

Otherwise, for all other special days, the Shofar is sounded shorter and two special silver Trumpets announced the sacrifice. When the trumpets sound the signal, all the people who were within the Temple complex prostrate themselves, stretching out flat, face down, and on the ground.

The shofar was blown in the times of Joshua to help him capture Jericho. As they surrounded the walls, the shofar was blown and the Jews were able to capture the city. The shofar was commonly taken out to war so the troops would know when a battle would begin. The person who would blow the shofar would call out to the troops from atop a hill. All of the troops were able to hear the call of the shofar from their position because of its distinct sound.

=== Post-Biblical times ===
While the shofar is best known nowadays for its use on Rosh Hashana, it also has a number of other ritual uses. It is blown each morning (and in some communities in the afternoon as well) during the month of Elul, and to mark the end of the day of fasting on Yom Kippur, once the services have been completed in the evening.

In Talmudic times the shofar was also blown to introduce Shabbat. It was also used both to initiate and dissolve a Herem.

At the inception of the diaspora, during the short-lived ban on playing musical instruments, the shofar was enhanced in its use, as a sign of mourning for the destruction of the temple. The declaration of the ban&#x27;s source was in fact set to the music itself as the lamentation &quot;Al Naharoth Bavel&quot; within a few centuries of the ban. (A full orchestra played in the temple. The ban was so that this would not be taken for granted, hence the wording of the ban, &quot;if I forget thee, O Jerusalem, over my chiefest joy...&quot;.) The shofar is generally no longer used for secular purposes (see a notable exception in a section further down).

Halakha (Jewish law) rules that the Rosh Hashana shofar blasts may not be sounded on Shabbat, due to the potential that the (shofar sounder) may inadvertently carry it, which is in a class of forbidden Shabbat work. Originally, the shofar was sounded on Shabbat in the Temple in Jerusalem. After the temple&#x27;s destruction, the sounding of the shofar on Shabbat was restricted to the place where the great Sanhedrin was located. However, when the Sanhedrin ceased to exist, the sounding of the shofar on Shabbat was discontinued.

=== Mitzvah ===

The Sages indicated that the mitzvah was to hear the sounds of the shofar. If a shofar was blown into a pit or cave, one fulfilled the mitzvah if they heard the original sound, but not if they heard the echo. Thus, most modern halakhic authorities hold that hearing a shofar on the radio or the Internet would not be valid to satisfy the mitzvah because &quot;electronically reproduced sounds do not suffice for mitzvot that require hearing a specific natural sound... However, one should consult a competent rabbi if an unusually pressing situation arises, as some authorities believe that performing mitzvot through electronically reproduced sound is preferable to not performing them at all.&quot;

According to Jewish law women and minors are exempt from the commandment of hearing the shofar blown (as is the case with any positive, time-bound commandment), but they are encouraged to attend the ceremony.

If the (shofar sounder) blows with the intention that all who hear will perform the mitzvah, then anyone listening—even someone passing by—who intends to hear the Shofar can perform the mitzvah because the community blower blows for everybody. If the listener stands still, it is presumed he intends to hear. If one hears the blast but with no intention of fulfilling the mitzvah, then the mitzvah has not been fulfilled.

=== Qualifications ===

The expert who blows (or &quot;blasts&quot; or &quot;sounds&quot;) the shofar is termed the or (lit. &quot;master of the blast&quot;). Being a is an honor. Every male Jew is eligible for this sacred office, providing he is acceptable to the congregation. The one who blows the shofar on Rosh Hashanah should be learned in the Torah and shall be God-fearing.

The Shulchan Aruch discusses who is fit to blow the shofar on behalf of a congregation:
* Anyone not obligated to fulfill the mitzvah of sounding the shofar cannot fulfill the commandment for (cover) another whose duty it is to perform the mitzvah.
* Although a woman (who is exempt from this mitzvah because it is time-bound) may not blow the shofar for men (whose duty it is to perform the mitzvah), a woman may intone the shofar for herself and other women. The Halakhic authorities debate whether a woman may recite a blessing on commandments that they are not commanded to perform; generally, Ashkenazic women recite a blessing and Sephardic women do not.
* Only a freeman (not even a slave who will become free in the next month) can be a Ba&#x27;al Tekiah.

== Shape and material ==
=== Choice of animal ===
According to the Talmud, a shofar may be made from the horn of any animal from the Bovidae family except that of a cow, although a ram is preferable. Bovidae horns are made of a layer of keratin (the same material as human toenails and fingernails) around a core of bone, with a layer of cartilage in between, which can be removed to leave the hollow keratin horn. An antler, on the other hand, is made of solid bone, so an antler cannot be used as a shofar because it cannot be hollowed out.

There is no requirement for ritual slaughter (shechita). Theoretically, the horn can come from a non-kosher animal, because under most (but not all) interpretations of Jewish law, the shofar is not required to be (&#x27;permissible in your mouth&#x27;); the mitzvah is hearing the shofar, not eating the animal it came from. The shofar falls into the category of – objects used to perform a mitzvah that do not themselves have inherent holiness. Moreover, because horn is always inedible, it is considered (&#x27;mere dust&#x27;) and not a non-kosher substance.

The Elef Hamagen (586:5) delineates the order of preference: 1) curved ram; 2) curved other sheep; 3) curved other animal; 4) straight—ram or otherwise; 5) non-kosher animal; 6) cow. The first four categories are used with a &quot;bracha&quot; (blessing), the fifth without a &quot;bracha&quot;, and the last, not at all.
=== Construction ===
In practice, two species are generally used: the Ashkenazi and Sefardi shofar is made from the horn of a domestic ram, while a Yemeni shofar is made from the horn of a kudu. A Moroccan shofar is flat, with a single, broad curve.
A crack or hole in the shofar affecting the sound renders it unfit for ceremonial use. A shofar may not be painted in colors, but it may be carved with artistic designs. Shofars (especially the Sephardi shofars) are sometimes plated with silver across part of their length for display purposes, although this invalidates them for use in religious practices.

The horn is flattened and shaped by the application of heat, which softens it. A hole is made from the tip of the horn to the natural hollow inside. It is played much like a European brass instrument, with the player blowing through the hole while buzzing the lips, causing the air column inside to vibrate. Sephardi shofars do usually have a carved mouthpiece resembling that of a European trumpet or French horn, but smaller. Ashkenazi shofars do not.

Because the hollow of the shofar is irregular in shape, the harmonics obtained when playing the instrument can vary: rather than a pure perfect fifth, intervals as narrow as a fourth, or as wide as a sixth may be produced.
== Use in modern Jewish prayer ==
The shofar is used mainly on Rosh Hashanah. It is customary to blow the shofar 100 or 101 times on each day of Rosh Hashanah; however, halakha only requires that it be blown 30 times. The various types of blast are known as &quot;tekiah&quot;, &quot;shevarim&quot;, and &quot;teruah&quot;. The 30 required blasts consist of the sequences &quot;tekiah&quot;-&quot;shevarim&quot;-&quot;teruah&quot;-&quot;tekiah&quot;, &quot;tekiah&quot;-&quot;shevarim&quot;-&quot;tekiah&quot;, &quot;tekiah&quot;-&quot;teruah&quot;-&quot;tekiah&quot;, each sequence repeated three times.

The shofar is also blown in synagogue at the conclusion of Yom Kippur. Some only blow a &quot;tekiah gedolah&quot;; others blow &quot;tekiah&quot;-&quot;shevarim&quot;-&quot;teruah&quot;-&quot;tekiah&quot;.

Because of its inherent ties to the Days of Repentance and the inspiration that comes along with hearing its piercing blasts, the shofar is also blown after weekday morning services (in some communities, also at weekday afternoon services) for the entire month of Elul, the last month of the Jewish civil year, preceding Rosh Hashana. It is not blown on the last day of Elul (in some communities, the last 3 days of Elul), however, to mark the difference between the voluntary blasts of the month and the mandatory blasts of Rosh Hashana. Shofar blasts are also used in some communities during penitential rituals such as Yom Kippur Katan and optional prayer services called during times of communal distress. The exact modes of sounding can vary from location to location.

In an effort to improve the skills of shofar blowers, an International Day of Shofar Study is observed on Rosh Chodesh Elul, the start of the month preceding Rosh Hashanah.
== Non-religious usage ==
=== National liberation ===

During the Ottoman and the British rule of Jerusalem, Jews were not allowed to sound the shofar at the Western Wall. After the Six-Day War, Rabbi Shlomo Goren famously approached the Wall and sounded the shofar. This fact inspired Naomi Shemer to add an additional line to her song &quot;Jerusalem of Gold&quot;, saying, &quot;a shofar calls out from the Temple Mount in the Old City.&quot;

The Shofar has been sounded as a sign of victory and celebration. Jewish elders were photographed blowing multiple shofars after hearing that the Nazis surrendered on 8 May 1945. The shofar has played a major role in the pro-Israel movement and often played in the Salute to Israel Parade and other pro-Israel demonstrations.

In the inauguration ceremony of the President of Israel, a shofar is blown once the President has been sworn in, followed by a call of &quot;Long live the President&quot;.

=== American political use ===
An American group called Shofar Army, described by outsiders as Christian nationalists, have adopted the use of the shofar into their activities.

=== Non-religious musical usage ===
In pop music, the shofar is used by the Israeli Oriental metal band Salem in their adaptation of &quot;Al Taster&quot; (Psalm 27). The late trumpeter Lester Bowie played a shofar with the Art Ensemble of Chicago. In the film version of the musical &quot;Godspell&quot;, the first act opens with cast member David Haskell blowing the shofar. In his performances, Israeli composer and singer Shlomo Gronich uses the shofar to produce a wide range of notes. Since 1988, Rome-based American composer Alvin Curran&#x27;s project &quot;Shofar&quot; features the shofar as a virtuoso solo instrument and in combination with sets of natural and electronic sounds. Madonna used a shofar played by Yitzhak Sinwani on the Confessions Tour and the album &quot;Confessions on a Dance Floor&quot; for the song &quot;Isaac&quot;, based on Im Nin&#x27;alu. In 2003, The Howard Stern Show featured a contest called &quot;Blow the Shofar&quot;, which asked callers to correctly identify popular songs played on the shofar. Additionally, Stern Show writer Benjy Bronk has repeatedly used a shofar in his antics. The shofar is sometimes used in Western classical music. Edward Elgar&#x27;s oratorio &quot;The Apostles&quot; includes the sound of a shofar, although other instruments, such as the flugelhorn, are usually used instead.

The shofar has been used in a number of films, both as a sound effect and as part of musical underscores. Elmer Bernstein incorporated the shofar into several cues for his score for Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;; one of the shofar calls recorded by Bernstein was later reused by the sound editors for &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; for the Ewoks&#x27; horn calls. Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s scores to the films &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; also incorporate the shofar in their orchestration.

<text>David Andrew Stieb (; born July 22, 1957), nicknamed &quot;Sir David&quot;, is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) starting pitcher who spent the majority of his career with the Toronto Blue Jays. A seven-time All-Star, he won &quot;The Sporting News&quot;″ Pitcher of the Year Award in 1982. His 56.9 career wins above replacement (according to Baseball-Reference) are the highest of any Blue Jays player, and he also holds the franchise records for complete games (103), strikeouts (1,658), and innings pitched (2,873).

A promising outfielder prospect at Southern Illinois University, Stieb was converted to a starting pitcher after being drafted by the Blue Jays, who told him that it would be the quickest way to get him to the majors. Fast-tracked through the minors, he debuted in 1979. Stieb led the American League (AL) in earned run average (ERA) in 1985, finishing in the top five four other times (1982, 1983, 1984, and 1990). Stieb also twice led the AL in innings pitched (1982 and 1984). Injury prevented him from playing in the 1992 postseason, where the Blue Jays won their first World Series. After a stint with the Chicago White Sox, Stieb retired from baseball, only to make a brief return as a reliever for the Blue Jays in 1998 before retiring for good.

Stieb won 140 games in the 1980s, the second-highest total by a pitcher in that decade, behind only his rival (and later teammate) Jack Morris. He was known for flirting with no-hitters, having reached the ninth inning with no hits four times in five years before accomplishing the feat in 1990. As of 2024, Stieb&#x27;s no-hitter is the only one in Blue Jays history.

== Early years ==
Born in Santa Ana, California, Stieb was primarily an outfielder during his time at Oak Grove High School and at San Jose City College. In his later college years, he played varsity baseball at Southern Illinois University. At this point, Stieb played primarily as an outfielder. In his 1978 junior season, Stieb hit .394 with 12 home runs and 48 RBIs, and was named to &quot;The Sporting News&quot; All-American team (along with Kirk Gibson and Bob Horner).

Scouted by Bobby Mattick and Al LaMacchia of the Blue Jays as an outfield prospect in a varsity game, Stieb&#x27;s performance failed to impress until he was pressed into service as a relief pitcher. His pitching surprised and convinced the Blue Jays to draft him in the 1978 Major League Baseball draft. Stieb was initially reluctant to take the mound as a starting pitcher until he was told by the Blue Jays front office that &quot;the quickest way to make it [to the major leagues] would be pitching.&quot;

== Professional career ==
Stieb entered the Blue Jays farm system with very little pitching experience. Over the course of his college career, he pitched a grand total of 17 innings, mostly in relief. Nevertheless, he made four starts with the Single-A Dunedin Blue Jays in 1978, working to a 2.08 ERA. In 1979, he was promoted to the Blue Jays&#x27; AAA affiliate, the Syracuse Chiefs, working to a 2.12 ERA over a 5–2 record and 51 innings pitched. He made his first start for the Blue Jays on June 29, 1979, just a year after being drafted as an outfielder and with just 128 innings pitched in the minors.

Stieb made 18 starts in 1979, ending with seven complete games, a 4.31 ERA, and an 8–8 record (the best winning percentage on the pitching staff). Nevertheless, the Blue Jays were the worst team in the majors, struggling to a 53–109 record. The 1980 season was a big step for Stieb (if not for the team), who worked to a 3.71 ERA and established himself as the No. 2 starter in the rotation (behind Jim Clancy). This was after an April where he was named AL Pitcher of the Month, pitching to a 1.06 ERA over four games (three complete). At the end of April, the Blue Jays were atop the AL East, but faltered as the season went on and ended with a meager 67–95 record. However, Stieb was named to his first All-Star Game.

With a 3.19 ERA, Stieb led the Blue Jays staff in 1981 (ranking third among AL pitchers for WAR), though the season was shortened due to the 1981 strike. Friction between Stieb and management led to talk of an offseason trade (including one with the Philadelphia Phillies for Ryne Sandberg), but he was eventually considered too valuable to trade.

In 1982, Stieb worked to a 3.25 ERA, good enough for fifth in the AL, and a 17-14 record. He led the league in complete games (19) and innings pitched, with 288.1 (22 more than teammate Clancy, the next closest). For the first time he received votes for the Cy Young Award, finishing fourth behind winner Pete Vuckovich (who led the league in wins but had a worse ERA); he did win the &quot;Sporting News&quot; Pitcher of the Year Award. At the end of the season, he signed a six-year, $5 million contract with Toronto. In 1983, he again won 17 games and finished third in AL ERA (3.04) and second in IP (278.0). However, he did not receive any Cy Young votes.
Stieb finished with a 16-8 record in 1984, as Toronto finished second in the AL East to the Detroit Tigers, headlined by Stieb&#x27;s rival Jack Morris, who eventually won the 1984 World Series. Stieb worked to a 2.83 ERA, started the All-Star Game, and led the majors in IP (267.0) and in WAR (7.9), but finished seventh in Cy Young voting. The 1985 season saw Stieb led the AL with a 2.48 ERA, as well as the Blue Jays&#x27; first postseason appearance; Stieb started three games (1, 4, and 7) in the ALCS, but the Blue Jays fell to the eventual World Series champion Kansas City Royals. Despite his strong campaign, he again finished seventh in Cy Young balloting, losing out to Bret Saberhagen of the Royals.

In 1985, Stieb signed with the Blue Jays what was then one of the most lucrative contracts in baseball. The contract, including options exercisable by the team, was for a term of eleven years and specified a salary that increased to $1.9 million in 1993, $2 million in 1994, and $2.1 million in 1995. While this was seen to be generous at the time the contract was signed, by the time the later years of the contract came around this was a bargain, considering that several players were receiving several times the amount per year. The Blue Jays voluntarily renegotiated the last three years of his contract to pay him a higher amount in recognition of his years of service.

Stieb finished the 1986 season 7-12, struggling to a 4.74 ERA. He improved in 1987, finishing with a 4.09 ERA in 185 IP, and in 1988, with a 3.04 ERA. However, Toronto struggled to repeat the success it found in 1985.

Stieb was known for flirting with, and struggling to close out, no-hitters. He took a no-hitter into the ninth inning in a 1985 game; this bid was broken up by back-to-back home runs and Stieb was replaced in the game before he recorded an out in the ninth. In 1988, he was a single strike away from a no-hitter in two successive starts, on September 24 against Cleveland and September 30 against Baltimore; both attempts were broken up on 2-2 counts by the 27th batter (Julio Franco and Jim Traber, respectively). On August 4, 1989, he nearly had a perfect game, but it too was broken up with two outs in the ninth. On September 2, 1990, he pitched the first (and, , only) no-hitter in Blue Jays history, defeating the Cleveland Indians 3–0.

Going into the 1989 season, Stieb brought a scoreless streak to 34 straight innings, the longest such streak in franchise history, before giving up one run to the Royals on April 5, 1989. He finished the season at 17-8 with a 3.35 ERA, but lost both of his starts in the ALCS, as Toronto fell to the eventual-world champion Oakland Athletics. In 1990, Stieb finished with a 2.93 ERA, fifth in the AL, and earned his seventh and last All-Star nomination. He also finally pitched his no-hitter against the Indians in September.

After an excellent 1990 season, a series of shoulder and back injuries early in the 1991 season ended his effective pitching years, culminating in a 4–6 season in 1992 that resulted in his release after the season ended. He was awarded a World Series ring after the Blue Jays won their first championship later that year, despite not pitching in the postseason due to injuries. In 1993, he played four games with the Chicago White Sox, before finally retiring due to lingering back problems.

In 1998, Stieb returned to the Blue Jays as a spring training coach. Despite a five-year hiatus from baseball, Stieb noticed that his old injuries did not bother him while throwing, and he eventually asked manager Tim Johnson for the opportunity to pitch. At 40 years old, he worked his way through the minors and eventually pitched in 19 games (three starts) for the major league club, going 1–2 with a 4.83 ERA.

== Pitching style ==
Stieb entered the league primarily as a power pitcher, relying on a high, inside fastball to strike batters out. The brushback pitch was an integral part of his repertoire to back batters off the plate, and was especially tough on right-handed hitters in this respect. As a result, he was the leader in hit batsmen in the American League in 1981, 1983, 1984, 1986, and 1989, and he was in the top three in 1985, 1988, and 1990. But arguably his best pitch was his slider that had a late and very sharp break, especially difficult for right-handed batters to handle; modern commentators have characterized this pitch as a &quot;sweeper,&quot; though the term was not in use during Stieb&#x27;s career.

Later on in his career he developed his breaking ball repertoire, and he became very effective with a &quot;dead fish&quot; curveball that would break into the dirt as the batter swung.

Stieb had a high-strung personality and was known as a fierce competitor on the mound; he was regularly seen having animated conversations with himself between pitches when in difficult situations. Whereas with other pitchers this would be seen as a sign of weakness, with Stieb it was perceived as the best way to motivate himself to get out of a jam. Early in his career, Stieb would also frequently yell at his teammates after errors, for plays that he thought they should have made. His personality also did not endear him to baseball writers, according to columnist Stephen Brunt:

In later years, Stieb mellowed somewhat, although a fierce glare after a botched play was still not uncommon.

== Personal life ==

He was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame, located in St. Marys, Ontario, with the Class of 2005.

Stieb currently resides in Reno, Nevada, where he works as a building contractor. After his career in baseball, he has taken up the electric guitar.

Stieb&#x27;s older brother, Steve, was a catcher and pitcher in the Atlanta Braves minor league system from 1979 to 1981.

== Legacy ==

During his career, Stieb won 176 games while losing 137. Only Jack Morris won more games in the 1980s. Stieb holds career records for Toronto pitchers in wins, games started, shutouts, strikeouts, complete games and a variety of other categories. Stieb appeared in seven All-Star games, also a Blue Jays team record.

Baseball writer and statistician Bill James called Dave Stieb, in his prime, the best pitcher of his era. He compared Stieb to Jim Bunning, arguing that both pitchers deserved &quot;more than one&quot; Cy Young Award, but never won one, thanks to poor run support. In 2009, a panel of Baseball-Reference historians listed him as the fourth best pitcher of the 1980s, behind Tommy John and Hall-of-Famers Nolan Ryan and Bert Blyleven (and ahead of Jack Morris).

On August 29, 2010, Stieb threw the ceremonial first pitch at the Rogers Centre, celebrating the 20th anniversary of his no-hitter game, with the anniversary coming four days after the celebration. Stieb&#x27;s number 37 was written on the pitcher&#x27;s mound for that game and 10,000 bobbleheads of Stieb were handed out to fans upon entrance.

Stieb&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Tomorrow I&#x27;ll Be Perfect&quot;, was co-written with Kevin Boland and released in 1986.

Stieb was the subject of a 2022 four-part miniseries by Secret Base&#x27;s Jon Bois and Alex Rubenstein, entitled &quot;Captain Ahab: The Story of Dave Stieb&quot;; in addition to discussing his career, the series advocated for his induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame based on his accomplishments. It was an effort to invoke empathy for him due to his six no-hitters lost past the sixth inning (especially the three lost after 26 outs) and his lack of representation because of his lower win totals compared to other dominant pitchers since the Blue Jays&#x27; less-than-optimal run support for him prevented him from achieving ones higher. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised &quot;Captain Ahab&quot; as &quot;not a standard, staid hagiography — it’s a whimsical and discursive look at statistics, passion, fandom, culture in general and baseball culture in particular&quot;. &quot;Paste&quot; magazine and &quot;Polygon&quot; included the series in their lists of the best documentaries and video essays (respectively) of 2022.

== Hall of Fame consideration ==
Stieb became eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in , but received only seven votes (1.4%) and fell off the ballot in his first year. He was omitted from the Modern Baseball ballots in and and the Contemporary Baseball ballot in .

Since falling off the ballot, Stieb&#x27;s candidacy has attracted renewed interest. Part of the reason has been the emergence of advanced sabermetrics; among starting pitchers in the 1980s, Stieb leads the decade in wins above replacement (WAR) and adjusted ERA+. Writing for &quot;The Athletic&quot; in 2020, Joe Posnanski listed Stieb as one of the 100 best players not in the Hall of Fame. Posnanski called Stieb &quot;a master at being underrated and underappreciated,&quot; noting that Stieb has a higher JAWS score (measuring a player&#x27;s merit for induction into the Hall) than Dennis Eckersley, who was also on his first ballot in 2004 and inducted with 414 votes. Jay Jaffe of Baseball Prospectus (the creator of JAWS) wrote that Stieb, along with Orel Hershiser, was the best pitcher from &quot;[a] very underrepresented era of pitchers&quot; in the Hall of Fame, adding that his career &quot;[fits] well within the range of many Hall of Fame starters whose places in Cooperstown don’t keep us lying awake at night.&quot;

In their &quot;Captain Ahab&quot; documentary series, Alex Rubenstein and Jon Bois suggested that Stieb&#x27;s brief comeback in 1998 hurt his candidacy; by &quot;restarting the clock&quot; on the five-year retirement period necessary before consideration, Rubenstein and Bois argued, Stieb guaranteed that the BBWAA members voting in 2004 would barely remember his dominant seasons of the early 1980s.

In 2017, Stieb told &quot;The Sporting News&quot; that, based on the traditional metric of wins-and-losses, he knew that he didn&#x27;t belong in the Hall of Fame. However, he added that he felt he did not deserve to be &quot;just wiped off the map&quot; after one year on the ballot. &quot;It&#x27;s like an insult,&quot; he said. &quot;What it told me was in [the voters&#x27;] minds, I didn&#x27;t even do anything worth recognizing.&quot;

<text>Napalm Death are an English grindcore band formed in Meriden, West Midlands, in 1981. None of the band&#x27;s original members have been in the group since 1986, but since &quot;Utopia Banished&quot; (1992), the lineup of bassist Shane Embury, guitarist Mitch Harris, drummer Danny Herrera and lead vocalist Mark &quot;Barney&quot; Greenway has remained consistent through most of the band&#x27;s career. From 1989 to 2004, Napalm Death were a five-piece band after they added Jesse Pintado and Mitch Harris as replacements for guitarist Bill Steer. Following Pintado&#x27;s departure, the band reverted to a four-piece.

The band is credited as pioneers of the grindcore genre by incorporating elements of crust punk and death metal, using a noise-filled sound that uses distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdrive bass, high-speed tempo, blast beats, vocals that consist of incomprehensible growls or high-pitched shrieks, extremely short songs, and sociopolitical lyrics. The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Scum&quot;, released in 1987 by Earache Records, proved substantially influential throughout the global metal community. According to the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, their song &quot;You Suffer&quot; is the shortest song ever recorded, at 1.316 seconds long. By their third album &quot;Harmony Corruption&quot; (1990), the band shifted to death metal and began writing longer songs. 

Napalm Death have released sixteen studio albums, and as of 2003 are listed by Nielsen SoundScan as the seventh-best-selling death metal band in the United States. According to former vocalist Lee Dorrian, &quot;Scum&quot; and &quot;From Enslavement to Obliteration&quot; (1988) have sold a combined total of 400,000 copies worldwide.

==History==

===Early history (1981–1986)===

Napalm Death were formed in the village of Meriden near Coventry, in the United Kingdom, in May 1981 by Nic Bullen and Miles Ratledge while the duo were still in their early teenage years. The duo had been playing in amateur bands since 1980 as an extension of their fanzine writing, and went through a number of names (including &quot;Civil Defence&quot;, &quot;The Mess&quot;, &quot;Evasion&quot;, &quot;Undead Hatred&quot; and &quot;Sonic Noise&quot;) before choosing Napalm Death in mid 1981. The band were initially inspired by the early wave of punk bands, particularly the anarcho-punk movement (a subgenre of punk music focused on anarchist politics), and associated groups such as Crass.

The first stable line-up of the group consisted of Nicholas Bullen on bass and lead vocals, Simon Oppenheimer on guitars, and Miles Ratledge on drums, and lasted from December 1981 to January 1982. Graham Robertson joined on bass in January 1982. Simon Oppenheimer left the group in August 1982 and was replaced by Darryl Fedeski who left the group in October 1982: at this point, Graham Robertson began to play guitar and Finbarr Quinn (ex-Curfew) joined on bass and backing vocals.
The group played concerts throughout 1982 (playing their first concert on 25 July 1982 at Atherstone Miners Club) and 1983 (sharing billing with anarcho-punk groups such as Amebix, The Apostles and Antisect), and made four demo recordings in 1982 and 1983, one of which contributed their first released recording to the &quot;Bullshit Detector Volume 3&quot; compilation released by Crass Records in 1984.

The band entered a period of hiatus from the end of 1983 onwards, playing only one concert in 1984 (a benefit for striking mine workers) with additional vocalist Marian Williams (ex-Relevant POS, and sister of the drummer of the group Human Cabbages from Coventry, UK). During this period, Nic Bullen met Justin Broadrick, a guitarist from Birmingham with whom he shared an interest in the music of bands such as Killing Joke, Throbbing Gristle, Crass, Amebix, Swans, and the developing power electronics scene. Bullen joined Broadrick&#x27;s Final project for a period in 1983.

In July 1985, Napalm Death briefly reformed in order to appear at a concert at the Mermaid in Birmingham which was also notable as the last concert by Final. The group consisted of a four-piece line-up of Miles Ratledge on drums; Bullen - performing vocals, bass and guitar; Graham Robertson on guitar and bass, and Damien Errington on guitar. After this concert, Miles Ratledge and Bullen asked Broadrick to join Napalm Death as guitarist, with Bullen as vocalist and bass player. The band began to develop a musical style which blended elements of post-punk (particularly Killing Joke and Amebix), heavy hardcore punk in the vein of Discharge, and thrash metal (with particular reference to Possessed and extreme metal group Celtic Frost).

The group played their first concert as a trio on 31 August 1985 (playing two concerts on the same day: Telford with Chumbawamba and Blyth Power, and Birmingham with We&#x27;ve Got a Fuzzbox and We&#x27;re Gonna Use It), and began to play regularly in the Birmingham area (particularly at The Mermaid public house in the Sparkhill area of Birmingham) with a wide range of musicians including Icons of Filth, Concrete Sox, The Varukers, Indecent Assault, Decadence Within, and The Groundhogs.

In September 1985, Peter Shaw joined on bass. The four-piece line-up recorded &quot;Hatred Surge&quot; (the band&#x27;s fifth demo recording) on 23 October 1985 which the band made available at their concerts and by mail. Following the recording of the demo, Bullen and Broadrick wished to extend their exploration of a more extreme musical style which created a split in the group with Ratledge: as a result, the group splintered and Mick Harris (a local fan) was asked to join as drummer in December 1985.

The trio – Bullen on vocals and bass, Broadrick on guitar and Harris on drums – made their first performance on 15 December 1985 and went on to play many concerts in 1986, predominantly in the Birmingham area, with musicians such as Amebix, Antisect, Chaos UK, Varukers, Disorder and Dirge. The group recorded a sixth demo, &quot;From Enslavement to Obliteration&quot;, on 15 March 1986, which the group made available at their concerts and through mail, before making a seventh recording later that year, &quot;Scum&quot;, which was provisionally intended to form part of a split LP with the English hardcore band Atavistic on Manic Ears Records. This recording later became the first side of the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Scum&quot; in 1987.
The band then faced a number of line-up changes. Nic Bullen was becoming frustrated with the musical direction of the group, and began to lose interest as a whole: as a result, Jim Whiteley was asked to join as bass player. The band played a number of concerts as a four-piece before Justin Broadrick left the group to play drums for local band Head of David. The group attempted to find a new guitarist by asking Shane Embury (ex-Unseen Terror and a fan of the group) to join and giving a trial period to Frank Healy (ex-Annihilator, later of Cerebral Fix and Sacrilege). After Broadrick&#x27;s departure, Nic Bullen&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the musical direction of the group led him to leave the group in December 1986 (in order to focus on his studies in English Literature and Philosophy at university), leaving the group without any of its original members.

===&quot;Scum&quot; and &quot;From Enslavement to Obliteration&quot; (1987–1989)===

With the departure of Broadrick and Bullen, the remaining members started looking for people who could fill in the roles. Guitarist Bill Steer played in a death metal band based in Liverpool called Carcass, and given the affinity between the two, he joined Napalm Death while still playing an active role in the former. They had also asked another friend, Coventrian (Lee Dorrian), to join as vocalist due to his good relationship with the group, even though he had never been in a band before. This line-up recorded the B side of the &quot;Scum&quot; LP at Rich Bitch studios in early May 1987, and the album was released through Earache Records.

The band promptly lost another member just after they undertook a short tour after the release of &quot;Scum&quot;. Jim Whiteley left the group (and subsequently joined Weston-Super-Mare based band Ripcord with whom the aforementioned tour had been shared) and Shane Embury (former drummer of Unseen Terror) moved to bass. The band then appeared on two compilation records (&#x27;North Atlantic Noise Attack&#x27; and the &#x27;Pathological Compilation&#x27;), recorded two Peel sessions and a split 7-inch with Japanese band S.O.B. They also returned to Rich Bitch studio once more and recorded their second album: &quot;From Enslavement to Obliteration&quot;.

A follow-up release to &quot;Enslavement...&quot; came in the form of the six song 12-inch EP &quot;Mentally Murdered&quot;, which was to be the last recording with the Harris/Steer/Dorrian/Embury line-up. This EP was recorded at the Slaughterhouse Studios and took on a slightly different sound, blending grindcore with death metal. Following the release, Napalm Death were featured on national television in the United Kingdom in a heavy metal special by Arena (BBC 2).
The band continued to tour, but as soon as they came back home from Japan, in July 1989, Steer and Dorrian left the band: Steer decided to dedicate himself full-time to Carcass, while Dorrian formed the doom metal group Cathedral. The group recruited Jesse Pintado (ex-Terrorizer) on guitar and Mark &quot;Barney&quot; Greenway (ex-Benediction) as vocalist. This line-up took part in the Grindcrusher tour organised by Earache Records and featuring fellow label-mates Carcass, Bolt Thrower and Morbid Angel. The group recruited Mitch Harris (ex-Righteous Pigs) as second guitarist after the tour.

===Rise to success (1990–1994)===
In Florida, the group began work on &quot;Harmony Corruption&quot;. &quot;Corruption&quot; saw stylistic changes from the band, exhibiting blast beats and slower tempos. Death metal was a greater influence on &quot;Corruption&quot; than previous records. Following the record&#x27;s release, &quot;Live Corruption&quot;, a live recording of the band&#x27;s 30 June 1990 performance at the Salisbury Arts Centre, was released in 1992.

Negative fan reactions to &quot;Corruption&quot; and accusations of selling out, compelled the band to reconsider its stylistic changes. The group entered Eddie Van Dale&#x27;s Violent Noise Experience Club in March 1991 to record six new tracks. The songs produced by this session and released on the &quot;Mass Appeal Madness&quot; 12-inch EP exhibited a much more &quot;raw&quot; quality, again finding favour with fans. This recording, along with the &quot;Mentally Murdered&quot; 12-inch, the split 7-inch with S.O.B. and live tracks from &quot;Live Corruption&quot;, were released on &quot;Death by Manipulation&quot;.

Drummer Mick Harris—the only remaining member of the &quot;Scum&quot; line-up—eventually left Napalm Death due to conflicts with the rest of the group over changes in its stylistic direction. In April 1991, Harris recorded &quot;Guts of a Virgin&quot;, the debut album for Painkiller, along with John Zorn and Bill Laswell. Harris later recalled the &quot;Guts&quot; sessions were when he decided to leave Napalm Death and explore different genres of music. Danny Herrera, a close friend of Jesse Pintado, was brought in as the new drummer. Herrera&#x27;s drumming style has been noted for its uniqueness; it has been described as &quot;Euroblast&quot;, a variant of blast beat in which simultaneous eighth notes are played on the ride cymbal and kick drum, with alternate eighth notes added on the snare drum. The addition of Herrera would be the last major line-up change of the band save for Jesse Pintado&#x27;s departure in 200, which returned the band to a quartet configuration.

Napalm Death released the album &quot;Utopia Banished&quot; in 1992, produced by Colin Richardson. This release was a kind of &quot;return to the roots&quot;: grindcore. After recording &quot;The World Keeps Turning&quot; EP, the band toured Europe with Dismember and Obituary on the &quot;Campaign for Musical Destruction&quot; tour. They then toured the US with Sepultura, Sacred Reich and Sick of It All. The proceeds of Napalm Death&#x27;s 1993 EP &quot;Nazi Punks Fuck Off&quot; were donated to anti-fascist organisations. This EP was inspired by Napalm Death touring South Africa during 1993, which was particularly controversial given that the band faced a lot of opposition from many white supremacists following the end of Apartheid.

The band remixed the track &quot;Mind of a Razor&quot; by London-based hip hop crew Gunshot. The remixed version of the track appeared on the EP of the same name in 1992. Thereafter, they went to the studio and recorded &quot;Fear, Emptiness, Despair&quot;, which was released on 31 May 1994. The album represented a stylistic transition for Napalm Death. &quot;Fear, Emptiness, Despair&quot; maintained the complex music structures of their previous albums &quot;Utopia Banished&quot; and &quot;Harmony Corruption&quot;, but there was a greater emphasis placed on incorporating elements of groove into the band&#x27;s style, resulting in a wider use of mid-paced music. Bassist Shane Embury recounts that Helmet and their album &quot;Strap It On&quot; influenced the band&#x27;s style at the time, as they did many other heavy metal bands during the 1990s. Live concerts with Entombed, Obituary and Machine Head followed the album&#x27;s release.

===&quot;Diatribes&quot;, Greenway&#x27;s departure and return (1995–1999)===

Their EP &quot;Greed Killing&quot; was released through Earache in December 1995, followed by the album &quot;Diatribes&quot; in January 1996. There was greater animosity between the band during this time, with a rift between Greenway and the remainder of the band, especially over the band&#x27;s stylistic transition and the interference of background presences in the band, exemplifying the former when he stated that the band were &quot;letting go of what made the band special&quot;. Greenway was hence expelled from the band later in 1996, and went to record with fellow grindcore act Extreme Noise Terror (ENT) on their release &quot;Damage 381&quot;. Greenway has stated that following his expulsion he was &quot;devastated&quot; and did not want to commit to ENT in fear of a repetition of the events that took place within Napalm Death.

ENT&#x27;s vocalist Phil Vane replaced Greenway in Napalm Death. Alas, Shane Embury stated that Vane &quot;couldn&#x27;t pull off what was required. It was a hard day when I had to pull Phil aside and tell him it just wasn&#x27;t working. We had been too much into doing our own thing to acknowledge all of the parts that made the Napalm machine tick. I quickly made the call and asked Barney if he would rejoin—time away certainly gave all of us the chance for reflection, regrets and hopes for the future. He was surprised by the material, as it was heavy and some of the songs were fast—I don&#x27;t know what he really expected us to do!&quot;. Following Vane&#x27;s departure, Greenway returned and the band released the album &quot;Inside the Torn Apart&quot; on 3 June 1997. An EP and music video were released for the album&#x27;s track &quot;Breed to Breathe&quot; on 17 November 1997.

The album &quot;Words from the Exit Wound&quot; followed this, being released on 26 October 1998. The album was their last to be produced by Colin Richardson, who Embury believes hindered the album&#x27;s creation, ultimately affecting the album&#x27;s success. Embury has stated that bands such as Nasum influenced the album, and in Embury&#x27;s view, this album represented a turning point in the band&#x27;s sound, stating &quot;it was also a turning point in us moving towards rediscovering our roots.&quot; Embury also mentioned that following the album&#x27;s release, the band found it hard to tour due to restricted budgets from their record label, but Cradle of Filth and Nick Barker were able to alleviate this problem.

In 1999 the band made an appearance on Chris Evans&#x27; TFI Friday, playing three songs on a set lasting 59 seconds.

===Departure from Earache and the departure of Pintado (2000–2004)===
The band acrimoniously departed from Earache Records following &quot;Words from the Exit Wound&quot; and later released &quot;Enemy of the Music Business&quot; on the record label, Dream Catcher, on 25 September 2000; which showed the band&#x27;s anger with the music industry and especially with Earache, whilst also incorporating a greater grindcore influence than on their previous few albums. The album was produced jointly by Simon Efemey and Russ Russell, the latter of whom has since been a long-time collaborator with Napalm Death.

&quot;Order of the Leech&quot; continued with the previous album&#x27;s style, being released on 21 October 2002, also being produced jointly by Efemey and Russell. In 2003, Embury and Hererra formed the side-project Venomous Concept with Kevin Sharp and Buzz Osborne, and that group has since released four albums. In 2004, Napalm Death recorded a covers album called &quot;Leaders Not Followers: Part 2&quot;, the sequel to their earlier covers EP. It contains covers of old hardcore punk and heavy metal bands, including Cryptic Slaughter, Massacre, Kreator, Sepultura, Siege and Discharge. Due to personal problems, Jesse Pintado did not play on either &quot;Order of the Leech&quot; or &quot;Leaders Not Followers: Part 2&quot;, and left the band in early 2004. Nevertheless, Pintado stated that he left because he grew tired of Napalm Death and wanted to start something new. The two guitars that you hear is Mitch double-tracking.

===&quot;The Code Is Red...&quot; and &quot;Time Waits for No Slave&quot; (2005–2010)===
In April 2005, their next album &quot;The Code Is Red...Long Live the Code&quot; was released. It features guest appearances from Jeffrey Walker (Carcass), Jamey Jasta (Hatebreed vocalist) and Jello Biafra (formerly of Dead Kennedys, and Lard among many other bands). The album continued the band&#x27;s progressive approach to their brutal brand of extreme metal, with their trademark grindcore sound retained. Also in 2005, Embury and Herrera joined the extreme metal band Anaal Nathrakh for one tour.

Napalm Death finished recording their follow-up album titled &quot;Smear Campaign&quot; in June 2006, and it was released on 15 September 2006 to strong reviews from fans and critics alike. The main lyrical focus is criticism of the United States Government and other governments who are strongly religious. The album features a guest appearance by Anneke van Giersbergen, vocalist for the Dutch rock band The Gathering. There is a limited edition digipak version of &quot;Smear Campaign&quot;, which has two new songs, &quot;Call That an Option?&quot; and &quot;Atheist Runt&quot;. They played a series of headline shows in support of the release including the Koko in Camden with Gutworm. 

In early 2006 Napalm Death headlined a tour with Kreator, A Perfect Murder, and Undying. On 27 August 2006, Jesse Pintado died in a hospital in the Netherlands due to liver failure, prompting Mitch Harris to express his sadness at the loss of someone he thought of as &quot;a brother&quot; on the band&#x27;s official website. After the Smear Campaign tour, the band did a 2007 &quot;World Domination Tour&quot;. Bassist Shane Embury is currently working on a project with Mick Kenney of Anaal Nathrakh, their work together will be released on FETO Records at the end of 2007. In November 2008, Napalm Death&#x27;s fourteenth studio album, entitled &quot;Time Waits for No Slave&quot;, leaked onto the internet; it was officially released on 23 January 2009. Similar to &quot;Smear Campaign&quot;, &quot;Time Waits For No Slave&quot; also had a digipak version containing two extra songs (&quot;Suppressed Hunger&quot; and &quot;Omnipresent Knife in Your Back&quot;).

===&quot;Utilitarian&quot; and &quot;Apex Predator – Easy Meat&quot; (2011–2016)===

In February 2011, Napalm Death appeared in an episode of E4&#x27;s &quot;Skins&quot;. In October 2011, Napalm Death performed at The Zoo, in Canada in which they debuted their song &#x27;Quarantined&#x27;. Napalm Death entered Parlour Studio in Kettering, with producer Russ Russell to begin working on a new album. Also in 2011, they recorded the single &quot;Legacy Was Yesterday&quot;. Napalm Death released their fourteenth studio album, &quot;Utilitarian&quot;, on 27 February 2012 in Europe and 28 February in North America via Century Media. In March 2012, Napalm Death headlined the Metal Mayhem IV festival organized by &quot;Defenders of Metal&quot; in Nepal. This was the first time Napalm Death played in Nepal.

Napalm Death were scheduled to play a special one-off show at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, on 22 March 2013. The show was eventually cancelled at the Victoria and Albert Museum, due to concerns that the noise levels could damage parts of the museum. The show was relocated to the De La Warr Pavilion in Bexhill, and was performed on 29 November 2013. The performance was a collaboration with ceramicist and Victoria and Albert Artist in Residence Keith Harrison. The show featured 10 large-scale wooden speakers filled with liquid clay that were left to solidify. When the band began to play, the clay inside the speakers was expected to vibrate, causing the speakers to crack and eventually explode. The actual performance was considered anticlimactic, as the speakers withstood the sonic vibration.

In April 2014, the band released a cover of the Cardiacs&#x27; song &quot;To Go Off and Things&quot; via Bandcamp. All proceeds from the single went towards Cardiacs frontman Tim Smith&#x27;s recovery from a simultaneous heart attack/stroke he suffered in 2008. The band announced on 5 November 2014, via Facebook that due to an illness in the family, Mitch Harris would be taking a hiatus from the band, to be replaced by various guitarists on their tour. Napalm Death&#x27;s fifteenth studio album, &quot;Apex Predator – Easy Meat&quot;, was released on 26 January 2015. On 4 July, a Nepal Charity Event track from the Apex Predator sessions called &quot;Earth Wire&quot; was released on their page.

===&quot;Throes of Joy in the Jaws of Defeatism&quot; (2017–present)===
In August 2017, it was announced that Napalm Death entered the studio to begin recording their sixteenth studio album for an early 2018 release. In September, frontman Mark &quot;Barney&quot; Greenway spoke to Australia&#x27;s &quot;Sticks for Stones&quot; condemning the announcement and stated that no material was being worked on at the moment but was in the &quot;preliminary stages&quot;. He then said that it would not be released until later next year. In an interview at Download Festival in June 2018, Greenway confirmed that guitarist Mitch Harris would appear on the new album, which was not expected to be released until 2019, but did not know if he would tour with them again. Bassist Shane Embury confirmed in a March 2019 interview with Extreme Metal Festival News that Harris &quot;did come over and record guitars on the new record&quot; and Greenway has &quot;nearly recorded all his vocal parts&quot;. He added, however, that the album would not be released before early 2020.

Napalm Death (along with Lamb of God, Anthrax, and Testament) opened for Slayer on their final North American tour in the summer of 2018. In October 2019, Shane Embury announced that he would be unable to join the band during their North American Tour. Vernon Blake was announced as substitute live bassist.

An EP titled &quot;Logic Ravaged by Brute Force&quot; was released on 7 February 2020. The band released their sixteenth studio album, &quot;Throes of Joy in the Jaws of Defeatism&quot;, in September 2020.

== Style ==
Napalm Death are considered a grindcore band. The band played &quot;usual heavy metal fare&quot; in the beginning of their career, but later began to incorporate elements of hardcore punk and thrash metal. The band eventually began to incorporate elements of crust punk, noise rock, industrial music and death metal. Napalm Death are known for the brief durations of their songs. Harmony Corruption has been described as a &quot;standard death metal&quot; album.

==Influence and legacy==
Jason Ankeny of AllMusic conferred the title of &quot;the fathers of grindcore&quot; on Napalm Death, contending the band broke ground by pushing heavy metal &quot;into new levels of extremity&quot;. Jason Birchmeier, also of AllMusic, called Napalm Death &quot;the definitive grindcore band&quot;, arguing that the albums Scum and From Enslavement to Obliteration &quot;practically alone&quot; define the genre.

Napalm Death coined the blast beat terminology for the famous hardcore punk drum technique. Dave Vincent of influential death metal band Morbid Angel recalls hearing Napalm Death for the first time:
==Political views==
The band espouse anarchism, humanism, socialism and animal rights.

Napalm Death congratulated the Indonesian President Joko Widodo, a fan of the band, on their Facebook page. However, the band wrote an open letter asking Widodo to show clemency for Lindsay Sandiford, who was sentenced to death after a drug smuggling conviction in Indonesia.

== Society and culture ==

=== &quot;Skins&quot; ===
In the E4 teen comedy-drama &quot;Skins&quot;, the seasons 5-6 character Rich Hardbeck (Alex Arnold) is a metalhead whose self-proclaimed favourite band is Napalm Death. In the show&#x27;s fifth season finale, a special appearance from Napalm Death&#x27;s Mark &quot;Barney&quot; Greenway featured a scene in which he and Rich have a heart-to-heart. Regarding the band&#x27;s appearance, Barney stated, &quot;One thing that bothers me about TV is the way that teenagers are portrayed. It&#x27;s down to the f--king &quot;Daily Mail&quot;&#x27;s war on teenagers. They stigmatize young kids and it&#x27;s bulls--t. The thing I like about &quot;Skins&quot; is it gives a genuine perspective on growing up. That&#x27;s why we agreed to do this show.&quot;

<text>The Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, shortened to EPCOT, was an unfinished concept for a planned community, intended to sit on a swath of undeveloped land near Orlando, Florida. It was created by Walt Disney in collaboration with the designers at Walt Disney Imagineering in the 1960s. Based on ideas stemming from modernism and futurism, and inspired by architectural literature about city planning, Disney intended EPCOT to be a utopian autocratic company town. One of the primary stated aims of EPCOT was to replace urban sprawl as the organizing force of community planning in the United States in the 1960s. Disney intended EPCOT to be a real city, and it was planned to feature commercial, residential, industrial, and recreational centers, connected by a mass multimodal transportation system, that would, he said, &quot;Never cease to be a living blueprint of the future&quot;.

Following Disney&#x27;s death in 1966, EPCOT plans were shelved. In 1971, Walt Disney World emerged, with EPCOT opening in 1982 as a theme park and influencing the nearby community of Celebration, Florida. Elements from the original EPCOT vision endured, shaping aspects of the modern Disney World park, such as the Monorail System and the Utilidor system.

==History==

Forerunners of Disney&#x27;s EPCOT plan include Tomorrowland in Disneyland, which already featured monorails and People Movers, and the Monsanto House of the Future (1957), which was designed by architects from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Architect/planner Victor Gruen&#x27;s plans to convert the site of the 1964-1965 New York World&#x27;s Fair was also a significant influence on EPCOT, Disney Imagineer Marty Sklar said. Concerned with the &quot;urban crisis&quot; of the time, which he believed was one of the biggest problems facing society, Disney also consulted urban planning literature, including books by Ebenezer Howard, founder of the architectural &quot;garden city movement&quot;, and Victor Gruen.

=== Location ===
Numerous locations were proposed for EPCOT, including St. Louis, Niagara Falls, Washington D.C., New Jersey, and New York City&#x27;s World Fair site. Disney also considered incorporating an experimental city into his plans for a Palm Beach, Florida development with RCA and investor John D. MacArthur in 1959. Eventually, Central Florida was chosen. Commenting on the choice, Disney said, &quot;Here in Florida we&#x27;ve enjoyed something that we&#x27;ve never enjoyed at Disneyland: a blessing of size. There&#x27;s enough land here to hold all the ideas and plans we could possibly imagine.&quot; The plans for &quot;The Florida Project&quot;, officially dubbed Disney World, called for a Disneyland-style theme park and resort area, EPCOT, an industrial park, an airport, and an entrance complex.

Disney quietly purchased undeveloped swampland in Osceola County and Orange County using dummy corporations to avoid price gouging. By June 1965, Disney had acquired 27,433 acres—twice the size of Manhattan—for an estimated $5.1 million ($ in ). Walt Disney had planned to announce Disney World on November 15, 1965, publicly. Still, after the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; broke the story of Disney&#x27;s land purchase, Disney asked then-Florida Governor Haydon Burns to confirm the story on October 25. His announcement boasted that the new theme park would be, &quot;The greatest attraction in the history of Florida.&quot; The official announcement was made on the previously planned November 15 date, with Disney joining Burns in Orlando for the press conference. Dissatisfied with the zoning regulations he had to deal with in Anaheim, Disney developed the Reedy Creek Improvement District (RCID) for the property. With the approval of the Florida legislature and the governor, as enshrined in the Reedy Creek Improvement Act, the District had most of the powers of a Florida county.

=== The EPCOT film ===
To lobby the Florida legislature to approve the RCID and persuade American industries to participate in the project, a short film was shot at the Walt Disney Studios on October 27, 1966, two months before Disney&#x27;s death. Written by Marty Sklar and directed by Art Vitarelli, the 25-minute film is hosted by Disney, who explains the plans for Disney World, focusing on how EPCOT would interrelate with other aspects of the property.

The film, utilizing concept art and highly technical animation, was a start to the conceptualization of EPCOT. The EPCOT philosophy, as it became known, included showcasing the development, testing, and use of new materials and ideas from American industries to find solutions to urban problems. EPCOT would always be in a state of becoming, the philosophy detailed, focusing on the needs and happiness of residents, and generating demand for new technologies.

&quot;EPCOT&quot; was screened for Florida legislators on February 2, 1967. Clips of the film were shown periodically as part of TV specials in the decades after that. The film was released in its entirety on DVD in May of 2004 as part of the &quot;Walt Disney Treasures: Tomorrowland&quot; collection.

==Master plan and community site==
Disney personally sketched a master plan for the Florida property known as the Seventh Preliminary Master Plot Plan, in 1966, the year of his death. The main features of the plan included the theme park, hotels, campgrounds and motels, convention facilities, the EPCOT city and a satellite community, a golf course, a &quot;swamp ride&quot;, an industrial park, a tourist trailer camp, a main entrance, and a &quot;jet airport&quot;. In addition, a monorail would run the length of the property, north to south.

The EPCOT city, according to the concepts presented in the EPCOT film, was based on a radial plan, a design inspired by the garden city movement of urban planning. Based on a concept similar to the layout of Disneyland, the city would have radiated out like a wheel-like spokes from a central core. The urban density of the area would decrease as the city stretched out.

Visitors would enter at the southern end of the Disney World property and be shuttled by monorail to the Welcome Center. There, they would be welcomed by Disney employees able to speak the guests&#x27; languages. Visitors would re-board the monorail to arrive at the industrial park. There, guests would ride people-movers to see warehouses and research and development laboratories from American industry. Walt hoped visitors could take ideas back home to improve their communities. After visiting the industrial park, the monorail would take the guests to EPCOT, where they would arrive at the central city.

===Transportation===

The city would be connected to the other points in Disney World with a main line of transportation—the monorail. Walt Disney introduced the Disneyland Monorail in 1959. The monorail would cut through the center of the city, connecting EPCOT with the northern and southern points of the Disney World property.

Internal transportation would be provided by a new Disney transportation concept, the WED way People Mover. The system uses motors located between the tracks to propel vehicles along a pair of steel rails. People Mover cars would transport residents from the metropolitan center to the outer residential areas. The People Mover concept was first demonstrated at Disneyland&#x27;s Tomorrowland in 1967. The People Mover was also installed at the Magic Kingdom as the WED Way People Mover in 1975.

Because of these two modes of transportation, residents of EPCOT would not need cars. If a resident-owned a car, it would be used &quot;only for weekend pleasure trips.&quot; The streets for cars would be kept separate from the main pedestrian areas. The main roads for both cars and supply trucks would travel underneath the city core, eliminating the risk of pedestrian accidents. This was also based on the concept that Walt Disney devised for Disneyland. He did not want his guests to see behind-the-scenes activity, such as supply trucks delivering goods to the city. Like the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World, all supplies are discreetly delivered via tunnels.

The two systems, the monorail, and People Mover, would come together at the EPCOT Transportation Lobby. The Transportation Lobby would be located at ground level, above the busy automobile/truck roads. From the Lobby, a passenger riding the monorail from the Magic Kingdom Park to their home would disembark the monorail and transfer to the appropriate People Mover station.

Beyond EPCOT, the Airport of Tomorrow, situated opposite the Main Entrance, was planned to connect to the park via a monorail station.

The planned airport would have had a general aviation area with an executive terminal, and another for regional passenger travel with a large terminal building. Plans identified the airport in 1966 but were not present in the revised plans in the later 1970s.

===City center===
EPCOT&#x27;s downtown and commercial areas would have been located in the central core of the city, away from the residential areas. The entire downtown would have been completely enclosed, unaffected by the outside elements. Roy Disney stated that &quot;The pedestrian will be king&quot; in this area, free from the danger of cars and other vehicles.

At the center of the area would be a 30-story Cosmopolitan Hotel and Convention Center. This building was to have been the tallest in Disney World and could have been seen for miles. The parking lot for hotel guests would have been located underneath the city core, right off of the vehicle throughway.

On the &quot;roof&quot; of the enclosed area would be the recreational area for hotel guests. The pool, tennis courts, basketball courts, shuffleboard, and other activities would have been located here. According to Imagineer Bob Gurr, Walt Disney pointed to one of the benches on the scale model of the area and declared, &quot;This is where Lilly [his wife] and I will sit when this thing is finished, taking everything in&quot;.

Surrounding the hotel, inside the enclosure, would have been &quot;shops and restaurants that reflect the culture and flavor of locations &#x27;round the world.&quot; According to the concept art, these areas would be themed to resemble each country, having the look and feel of each of the exotic locales. This concept eventually evolved into the World Showcase area of the Epcot theme park. The PeopleMover track would travel above these downtown shops and streets similarly as the system did in Disneyland. The preliminary plan indicated that the people who would have worked in these shops would have also lived in the city.

===Green belt===
Separating the city core from the low-density residential area would be an expanse of grass areas, known to the planners as the &quot;green belt.&quot; This is where the city services would be located. Establishments such as parks with playgrounds, community centers, schools, stadiums, and churches would be located here.

===Residential areas===
On the rim of the city core would have been high-density apartment housing. This is where most of EPCOT&#x27;s 20,000 citizens would have lived. Not much is discussed about the apartments themselves, although Walt Disney stated that no one in EPCOT would own their land. There would be no difference between an apartment and a home. All renting rates would be modest and competitive with the surrounding market. Housing would be constructed in such a way as to ensure ease of change so that new ideas/products could be used. A person returning from a hard day&#x27;s work could very well come home to a kitchen with brand-new appliances in it.

Beyond the Green Belt were the low-density, single-family house neighborhoods. These areas would have resembled the petals on a flower, with the houses located on the rim of each &quot;petal&quot;. Inside the &quot;petal&quot; was a vast green area. The area would have had paths for electric carts, light recreation areas for adults, and play areas for children. The People Mover station for each area would have also been located in the green area. The resident could simply walk to the station from their home and on to work. As with the apartments, the houses would be built to be easily changed.

===Living and employment===
As no one living in EPCOT would own their own land or home, residents would have no municipal voting rights (bond issues, etc.). Walt Disney wanted to exercise this control only to be able to change technology in homes easily.

According to the film, all adults living in EPCOT would be employed, thereby preventing the formation of slums and ghettos. There would be no retirees—everyone would be required to have a job. Residents would be employed at the Magic Kingdom theme park, the city&#x27;s central core shopping areas, the hotel/convention center, the airport, the Welcome Center, or the industrial park. As the film states, &quot;Everyone living in EPCOT will have the responsibility to maintain this living blueprint of the future&quot;.

== General Electric&#x27;s Progress City model ==

The Carousel of Progress, sponsored by General Electric, was one of four pavilions or attractions that Disney produced for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The show centered around an Audio-Animatronic family presenting the progress of household technology from the turn of the 20th century to the then-present. Guests were seated in an outer ring of six theaters that rotated around a fixed, circular stage. The show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;There&#x27;s a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow,&quot; was written by the Sherman brothers and reflects Walt&#x27;s upbeat view of progress and American industry.

When the Carousel of Progress opened in Tomorrowland at Disneyland in July of 1967, it featured a huge, one-eighth-scale model called Progress City on the second floor as the show&#x27;s finale. The model, which could be viewed either on foot or from the PeopleMover attraction, was constructed after Disney&#x27;s death and was meant to be a visual representation of his EPCOT plans, including the city center and hotel, high-density apartments, greenbelt, and single-family houses. It measured 6,900 square feet and included 22,000 trees and shrubs, 4,500 buildings lit from within, 1,400 streetlights, a climate-controlled center city, an amusement park, sports stadiums, an airport, an atomic power plant, underground passageways, single-family cul-de-sacs, electric sidewalks, schools, churches, electric trains, electric carts, and people movers.

General Electric and Westinghouse had been in merger discussions with the Disney organization, but a deal never came to fruition. EPCOT would be an expensive proposition. In a 1968 print advertisement, General Electric announced that it had &quot;much of the technology needed ... But as futuristic as it sounds, it could be built today.&quot; The ad also featured a photograph of Progress City. General Electric was prepared to tackle EPCOT.

Disneyland&#x27;s Carousel of Progress closed in 1973 and the show was moved to Walt Disney World&#x27;s Magic Kingdom in 1975. A portion of the Progress City architectural model is on display on the Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover today, located in Tomorrowland at the Magic Kingdom.

==EPCOT after Disney==

Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966. According to his older brother Roy Disney, Walt was still planning EPCOT in the hospital in the days before he died. Walt used the ceiling grid to lay out a scale plot plan in his imagination, each 24&quot; x 24&quot; tile representing one square mile.

Florida Governor Claude R. Kirk Jr. signed Chapter 67-764 into law on May 12, 1967, establishing the Reedy Creek Improvement District. However, Disney directors eventually decided that it was too risky to venture into city planning now that its biggest advocate was gone. Roy persisted and took the reins on the project, coming out of retirement, but he could not convince the board to build EPCOT. The Magic Kingdom project proceeded with construction beginning the same year under the supervision of Roy, and Walt Disney World Resort opened in October 1971 with only the Magic Kingdom and two hotels. Roy insisted it be called Walt Disney World as a tribute to the man who had dreamed it up.

Even though the city was never built, the Resort represents some of the forward-thinking planning that embodied Walt&#x27;s idea of EPCOT. Because of the formation of the RCID, Disney could find innovative solutions to the problems of transportation, building construction, supplying electrical power, and waste disposal. Imagineers, including John Hench and Richard Irvine, devised means of waste disposal and sewer transport. The monorail, while mainly an attraction at Disneyland, was utilized as an actual transportation system, taking guests some thirteen miles around the Resort area. The Contemporary Resort opened with the Magic Kingdom as an architectural remnant of EPCOT&#x27;s modernist aesthetic.

Without Walt Disney&#x27;s leadership, EPCOT&#x27;s progress was &quot;seriously weakened.&quot; In the late 1970s, Disney CEO Card Walker wanted to revisit the EPCOT idea, but the board was still wary, and all agreed that Walt&#x27;s EPCOT would not work in its initial incarnation; they thought that no one would want to live under a microscope and be watched constantly. The result of the compromise was the EPCOT Center theme park (now simply known as &quot;EPCOT&quot;), which opened in 1982. While still emulating Walt Disney&#x27;s ideas, it was not a city, but rather closer to that of a World&#x27;s Fair. EPCOT, somewhat true to Walt Disney&#x27;s vision, revolves around technology and the future in the Future World area. The World Showcase is an embellished version of the downtown shopping area, albeit without the enclosure.

In the early 1990s, the Walt Disney Company built a community on the Florida property called Celebration. It is a planned community that employs some of the ideas that Walt Disney envisioned but on a significantly smaller scale. Unlike EPCOT, which was based on modernism and futurism, there is no radial design for Celebration. Celebration is designed based on new urbanism, and resembles a small American town, but has all the modern conveniences, without the revolutionary transportation ideas contained in the plans for EPCOT. Similar planned communities, known as lifestyle centers, are now being built by other planners.

In the early 1970s, the city of Rotonda West, Florida, near to Punta Gorda on Florida&#x27;s Gulf of Mexico coastline, was created. The city uses a circular grid layout, divided into eight sections and a central hub, similar to a wagon wheel.

<text>This article collects together a variety of proofs of Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, which states that
:formula_1
for every prime number &quot;p&quot; and every integer &quot;a&quot; (see modular arithmetic).

==Simplifications==
Some of the proofs of Fermat&#x27;s little theorem given below depend on two simplifications.

The first is that we may assume that is in the range . This is a simple consequence of the laws of modular arithmetic; we are simply saying that we may first reduce modulo . This is consistent with reducing formula_2 modulo , as one can check.

Secondly, it suffices to prove that
:formula_3
for in the range . Indeed, if the previous assertion holds for such , multiplying both sides by yields the original form of the theorem,
:formula_4
On the other hand, if , the theorem holds trivially.

==Combinatorial proofs==

===Proof by counting necklaces===
This is perhaps the simplest known proof, requiring the least mathematical background. It is an attractive example of a combinatorial proof (a proof that involves counting a collection of objects in two different ways).

The proof given here is an adaptation of Golomb&#x27;s proof.

To keep things simple, let us assume that is a positive integer. Consider all the possible strings of symbols, using an alphabet with different symbols. The total number of such strings is since there are possibilities for each of positions (see rule of product).

For example, if and , then we can use an alphabet with two symbols (say and ), and there are strings of length 5:
: , , , , , , , ,
: , , , , , , , .

We will argue below that if we remove the strings consisting of a single symbol from the list (in our example, and ), the remaining strings can be arranged into groups, each group containing exactly strings. It follows that is divisible by .

====Necklaces====

Let us think of each such string as representing a necklace. That is, we connect the two ends of the string together and regard two strings as the same necklace if we can rotate one string to obtain the second string; in this case we will say that the two strings are &quot;friends&quot;. In our example, the following strings are all friends:
In full, each line of the following list corresponds to a single necklace, and the entire list comprises all 32 strings.
: , , , , ,
: , , , , ,
: , , , , ,
: .
Notice that in the above list, each necklace with more than one symbol is represented by 5 different strings, and the number of necklaces represented by just one string is 2, i.e. is the number of distinct symbols. Thus the list shows very clearly why is divisible by .

One can use the following rule to work out how many friends a given string has:
: If is built up of several copies of the string , and cannot itself be broken down further into repeating strings, then the number of friends of (including itself) is equal to the &quot;length&quot; of .

For example, suppose we start with the string , which is built up of several copies of the shorter string . If we rotate it one symbol at a time, we obtain the following 3 strings:
: ,
There aren&#x27;t any others because is exactly 3 symbols long and cannot be broken down into further repeating strings.

====Completing the proof====
Using the above rule, we can complete the proof of Fermat&#x27;s little theorem quite easily, as follows. Our starting pool of strings may be split into two categories:
* Some strings contain identical symbols. There are exactly of these, one for each symbol in the alphabet. (In our running example, these are the strings and .)
* The rest of the strings use at least two distinct symbols from the alphabet. If we can break up a given string into repeating copies of some string , the length of must divide the length of . But since the length of is the prime , the only possible length for is also . Therefore, the above rule tells us that has exactly friends (including itself).

The second category contains strings, and they may be arranged into groups of strings, one group for each necklace. Therefore, must be divisible by , as promised.

===Proof using dynamical systems===
This proof uses some basic concepts from dynamical systems.

We start by considering a family of functions &quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), where &quot;n&quot; ≥ 2 is an integer, mapping the interval [0, 1] to itself by the formula
:formula_5
where {&quot;y&quot;} denotes the fractional part of &quot;y&quot;. For example, the function &quot;T&quot;3(&quot;x&quot;) is illustrated below:

A number &quot;x&quot;0 is said to be a &quot;fixed point&quot; of a function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) if &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;0) = &quot;x&quot;0; in other words, if &quot;f&quot; leaves &quot;x&quot;0 fixed. The fixed points of a function can be easily found graphically: they are simply the &quot;x&quot; coordinates of the points where the graph of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) intersects the graph of the line &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;. For example, the fixed points of the function &quot;T&quot;3(&quot;x&quot;) are 0, 1/2, and 1; they are marked by black circles on the following diagram:

We will require the following two lemmas.

Lemma 1. For any &quot;n&quot; ≥ 2, the function &quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) has exactly &quot;n&quot; fixed points.

Proof. There are 3 fixed points in the illustration above, and the same sort of geometrical argument applies for any &quot;n&quot; ≥ 2.

Lemma 2. For any positive integers &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot;, and any 0 ≤ x ≤ 1,
:formula_6
In other words, &quot;T&quot;&quot;mn&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the composition of &quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;T&quot;&quot;m&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

Proof. The proof of this lemma is not difficult, but we need to be slightly careful with the endpoint &quot;x&quot; = 1. For this point the lemma is clearly true, since
:formula_7
So let us assume that 0 ≤ &quot;x&quot; &lt; 1. In this case,
:formula_8
so &quot;T&quot;&quot;m&quot;(&quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) is given by
:formula_9
Therefore, what we really need to show is that
:formula_10
To do this we observe that {&quot;nx&quot;} = &quot;nx&quot; − &quot;k&quot;, where &quot;k&quot; is the integer part of &quot;nx&quot;; then
:formula_11
since &quot;mk&quot; is an integer.

Now let us properly begin the proof of Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, by studying the function &quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). We will assume that &quot;a&quot; ≥ 2. From Lemma 1, we know that it has &quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot; fixed points. By Lemma 2 we know that
:formula_12
so any fixed point of &quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is automatically a fixed point of &quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

We are interested in the fixed points of &quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) that are &quot;not&quot; fixed points of &quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). Let us call the set of such points &quot;S&quot;. There are &quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot; − &quot;a&quot; points in &quot;S&quot;, because by Lemma 1 again, &quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) has exactly &quot;a&quot; fixed points. The following diagram illustrates the situation for &quot;a&quot; = 3 and &quot;p&quot; = 2. The black circles are the points of &quot;S&quot;, of which there are 32 − 3 = 6.

The main idea of the proof is now to split the set &quot;S&quot; up into its orbits under &quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot;. What this means is that we pick a point &quot;x&quot;0 in &quot;S&quot;, and repeatedly apply &quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot;(x) to it, to obtain the sequence of points
:formula_13
This sequence is called the orbit of &quot;x&quot;0 under &quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot;. By Lemma 2, this sequence can be rewritten as
:formula_14
Since we are assuming that &quot;x&quot;0 is a fixed point of &quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot; &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), after &quot;p&quot; steps we hit &quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;0) = &quot;x&quot;0, and from that point onwards the sequence repeats itself.

However, the sequence &quot;cannot&quot; begin repeating itself any earlier than that. If it did, the length of the repeating section would have to be a divisor of &quot;p&quot;, so it would have to be 1 (since &quot;p&quot; is prime). But this contradicts our assumption that &quot;x&quot;0 is not a fixed point of &quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot;.

In other words, the orbit contains exactly &quot;p&quot; distinct points. This holds for every orbit of &quot;S&quot;. Therefore, the set &quot;S&quot;, which contains &quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot; − &quot;a&quot; points, can be broken up into orbits, each containing &quot;p&quot; points, so &quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot; − &quot;a&quot; is divisible by &quot;p&quot;.

(This proof is essentially the same as the necklace-counting proof given above, simply viewed through a different lens: one may think of the interval [0, 1] as given by sequences of digits in base &quot;a&quot; (our distinction between 0 and 1 corresponding to the familiar distinction between representing integers as ending in &quot;.0000...&quot; and &quot;.9999...&quot;). &quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; amounts to shifting such a sequence by &quot;n&quot; many digits. The fixed points of this will be sequences that are cyclic with period dividing &quot;n&quot;. In particular, the fixed points of &quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot; can be thought of as the necklaces of length &quot;p&quot;, with &quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; corresponding to rotation of such necklaces by &quot;n&quot; spots.

This proof could also be presented without distinguishing between 0 and 1, simply using the half-open interval [0, 1); then &quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot; would only have &quot;n&quot; − 1 fixed points, but &quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot; − &quot;T&quot;&quot;a&quot; would still work out to &quot;a&quot;&quot;p&quot; − &quot;a&quot;, as needed.)

===Multinomial proofs===

====Proofs using the binomial theorem====

====Proof 1====

This proof, due to Euler, uses induction to prove the theorem for all integers .

The base step, that , is trivial. Next, we must show that if the theorem is true for , then it is also true for . For this inductive step, we need the following lemma.

Lemma. For any integers and and for any prime , .

The lemma is a case of the freshman&#x27;s dream. Leaving the proof for later on, we proceed with the induction.

Proof. Assume &quot;k&quot;&quot;p&quot; ≡ &quot;k&quot; (mod &quot;p&quot;), and consider (&quot;k&quot;+1)&quot;p&quot;. By the lemma we have

:formula_15

Using the induction hypothesis, we have that &quot;k&quot;&quot;p&quot; ≡ &quot;k&quot; (mod &quot;p&quot;); and, trivially, 1&quot;p&quot; = 1. Thus

:formula_16

which is the statement of the theorem for &quot;a&quot; = &quot;k&quot;+1. ∎

In order to prove the lemma, we must introduce the binomial theorem, which states that for any positive integer &quot;n&quot;,

:formula_17

where the coefficients are the binomial coefficients,

:formula_18

described in terms of the factorial function, &quot;n&quot;! = 1×2×3×⋯×&quot;n&quot;.

Proof of Lemma. We consider the binomial coefficient when the exponent is a prime &quot;p&quot;:

:formula_19

The binomial coefficients are all integers. The numerator contains a factor &quot;p&quot; by the definition of factorial. When 0 &lt; &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;p&quot;, neither of the terms in the denominator includes a factor of &quot;p&quot; (relying on the primality of &quot;p&quot;), leaving the coefficient itself to possess a prime factor of &quot;p&quot; from the numerator, implying that

:formula_20

Modulo &quot;p&quot;, this eliminates all but the first and last terms of the sum on the right-hand side of the binomial theorem for prime &quot;p&quot;. ∎

The primality of &quot;p&quot; is essential to the lemma; otherwise, we have examples like

:formula_21

which is not divisible by 4.

====Proof 2====

Using the Lemma, we have:

:formula_22.

====Proof using the multinomial expansion====
The proof, which was first discovered by Leibniz (who did not publish it) and later rediscovered by Euler, is a very simple application of the multinomial theorem, which states

:formula_23

where

:formula_24

and the summation is taken over all sequences of nonnegative integer indices such the sum of all is .

Thus if we express as a sum of 1s (ones), we obtain

:formula_25

Clearly, if is prime, and if is not equal to for any , we have

:formula_26

and if is equal to for some then

:formula_27

Since there are exactly elements such that for some , the theorem follows.

(This proof is essentially a coarser-grained variant of the necklace-counting proof given earlier; the multinomial coefficients count the number of ways a string can be permuted into arbitrary anagrams, while the necklace argument counts the number of ways a string can be rotated into cyclic anagrams. That is to say, that the nontrivial multinomial coefficients here are divisible by can be seen as a consequence of the fact that each nontrivial necklace of length can be unwrapped into a string in many ways.

This multinomial expansion is also, of course, what essentially underlies the binomial theorem-based proof above)

===Proof using power product expansions===

An additive-combinatorial proof based on formal power product expansions was given by Giedrius Alkauskas. This proof uses neither the Euclidean algorithm nor the binomial theorem, but rather it employs formal power series with rational coefficients.

==Proof as a particular case of Euler&#x27;s theorem==
This proof, discovered by James Ivory and rediscovered by Dirichlet, requires some background in modular arithmetic.

Let us assume that is positive and not divisible by .

The idea is that if we write down the sequence of numbers

and reduce each one modulo , the resulting sequence turns out to be a rearrangement of

Therefore, if we multiply together the numbers in each sequence, the results must be identical modulo :
:formula_28
Collecting together the terms yields
:formula_29
Finally, we may “cancel out” the numbers from both sides of this equation, obtaining
:formula_30

There are two steps in the above proof that we need to justify:
* Why the elements of the sequence (), reduced modulo , are a rearrangement of (), and
* Why it is valid to “cancel” in the setting of modular arithmetic.
We will prove these things below; let us first see an example of this proof in action.

===An example===

If and , then the sequence in question is
:formula_31
reducing modulo 7 gives
:formula_32
which is just a rearrangement of
:formula_33
Multiplying them together gives
:formula_34
that is,
:formula_35
Canceling out 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 yields
:formula_36
which is Fermat&#x27;s little theorem for the case and .

===The cancellation law===

Let us first explain why it is valid, in certain situations, to “cancel”. The exact statement is as follows. If , , and  are integers, and is not divisible by a prime number , and if

then we may “cancel” to obtain

Our use of this cancellation law in the above proof of Fermat&#x27;s little theorem was valid because the numbers are certainly not divisible by (indeed they are &quot;smaller&quot; than ).

We can prove the cancellation law easily using Euclid&#x27;s lemma, which generally states that if a prime divides a product (where and are integers), then must divide or . Indeed, the assertion () simply means that divides . Since is a prime which does not divide , Euclid&#x27;s lemma tells us that it must divide instead; that is, () holds.

Note that the conditions under which the cancellation law holds are quite strict, and this explains why Fermat&#x27;s little theorem demands that is a prime. For example, , but it is not true that . However, the following generalization of the cancellation law holds: if , , , and are integers, if and are relatively prime, and if
:formula_37
then we may “cancel” to obtain
:formula_38
This follows from a generalization of Euclid&#x27;s lemma.

===The rearrangement property===

Finally, we must explain why the sequence
:formula_39
when reduced modulo &quot;p&quot;, becomes a rearrangement of the sequence
:formula_40
To start with, none of the terms , , ..., can be congruent to zero modulo , since if is one of the numbers , then is relatively prime with , and so is , so Euclid&#x27;s lemma tells us that shares no factor with . Therefore, at least we know that the numbers , , ..., , when reduced modulo , must be found among the numbers .

Furthermore, the numbers , , ..., must all be &quot;distinct&quot; after reducing them modulo , because if
:formula_41
where and are one of , then the cancellation law tells us that
:formula_42
Since both and are between and , they must be equal. Therefore, the terms , , ..., when reduced modulo must be distinct. 
To summarise: when we reduce the numbers , , ..., modulo , we obtain distinct members of the sequence , , ..., . Since there are exactly of these, the only possibility is that the former are a rearrangement of the latter.

===Applications to Euler&#x27;s theorem===

This method can also be used to prove Euler&#x27;s theorem, with a slight alteration in that the numbers from to are substituted by the numbers less than and coprime with some number (not necessarily prime). Both the rearrangement property and the cancellation law (under the generalized form mentioned above) are still satisfied and can be utilized.

For example, if , then the numbers less than  and coprime with are , , , and . Thus we have:
:formula_43

Therefore,
:formula_44

==Proof as a corollary of Euler&#x27;s criterion==

==Proofs using group theory==

===Standard proof===
This proof requires the most basic elements of group theory.

The idea is to recognise that the set }, with the operation of multiplication (taken modulo ), forms a group. The only group axiom that requires some effort to verify is that each element of is invertible. Taking this on faith for the moment, let us assume that is in the range , that is, is an element of . Let be the order of , that is, is the smallest positive integer such that . Then the numbers reduced modulo  form a subgroup of  whose order is  and therefore, by Lagrange&#x27;s theorem, divides the order of , which is . So for some positive integer and then
:formula_45

To prove that every element of is invertible, we may proceed as follows. First, is coprime to . Thus Bézout&#x27;s identity assures us that there are integers and such that . Reading this equality modulo , we see that is an inverse for , since . Therefore, every element of is invertible. So, as remarked earlier, is a group.

For example, when , the inverses of each element are given as follows:

===Euler&#x27;s proof===
If we take the previous proof and, instead of using Lagrange&#x27;s theorem, we try to prove it in this specific situation, then we get Euler&#x27;s third proof, which is the one that he found more natural. Let be the set whose elements are the numbers reduced modulo . If , then and therefore divides . Otherwise, there is some .

Let be the set whose elements are the numbers reduced modulo . Then has distinct elements because otherwise there would be two distinct numbers } such that , which is impossible, since it would follow that . On the other hand, no element of can be an element of , because otherwise there would be numbers } such that , and then , which is impossible, since .

So, the set has elements. If it turns out to be equal to &quot;G&quot;, then and therefore divides . Otherwise, there is some and we can start all over again, defining as the set whose elements are the numbers reduced modulo . Since is finite, this process must stop at some point and this proves that divides .

For instance, if and , then, since
* ,
we have and }. Clearly, }. Let be an element of ; for instance, take . Then, since
* ,
* ,
we have }. Clearly, . Let be an element of ; for instance, take . Then, since
* ,
* ,
we have }. And now .

Note that the sets , , and so on are in fact the cosets of in .

<doc id="97169" wikidata="Q44782" url="?curid=97169" title="Port">
<text>A port is a maritime facility comprising one or more wharves or loading areas, where ships load and discharge cargo and passengers. Although usually situated on a sea coast or estuary, ports can also be found far inland, such as Hamburg, Manchester and Duluth; these access the sea via rivers or canals. Because of their roles as ports of entry for immigrants as well as soldiers in wartime, many port cities have experienced dramatic multi-ethnic and multicultural changes throughout their histories.

Ports are extremely important to the global economy; 70% of global merchandise trade by value passes through a port. For this reason, ports are also often densely populated settlements that provide the labor for processing and handling goods and related services for the ports. Today by far the greatest growth in port development is in Asia, the continent with some of the world&#x27;s largest and busiest ports, such as Singapore and the Chinese ports of Shanghai and Ningbo-Zhoushan. As of 2020, the busiest passenger port in Europe is the Port of Helsinki in Finland. Nevertheless, countless smaller ports do exist that may only serve their local tourism or fishing industries.

Ports can have a wide environmental impact on local ecologies and waterways, most importantly water quality, which can be caused by dredging, spills and other pollution. Ports are heavily affected by changing environmental factors caused by climate change as most port infrastructure is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise and coastal flooding. Internationally, global ports are beginning to identify ways to improve coastal management practices and integrate climate change adaptation practices into their construction.

==Historical ports==
Wherever ancient civilisations engaged in maritime trade, they tended to develop sea ports. One of the world&#x27;s oldest known artificial harbors is at Wadi al-Jarf on the Red Sea. Along with the finding of harbor structures, ancient anchors have also been found.

Other ancient ports include Guangzhou during Qin dynasty China and Canopus, the principal Egyptian port for Greek trade before the foundation of Alexandria. In Ancient Greece, Athens&#x27; port of Piraeus was the base for the Athenian fleet which played a crucial role in the Battle of Salamis against the Persians in 480 BCE. In ancient India from 3700 BCE, Lothal was a prominent city of the Indus valley civilisation, located in the Bhal region of the modern state of Gujarāt. Ostia Antica was the port of ancient Rome with Portus established by Claudius and enlarged by Trajan to supplement the nearby port of Ostia. In Japan, during the Edo period, the island of Dejima was the only port open for trade with Europe and received only a single Dutch ship per year, whereas Osaka was the largest domestic port and the main trade hub for rice.
Ostia Antica () is an ancient Roman city and the port of Rome located at the mouth of the Tiber. It is near modern Ostia, southwest of Rome. Due to silting and the invasion of sand, the site now lies from the sea. The name &quot;Ostia&quot; (the plural of &quot;ostium&quot;) derives from Latin &quot;os&quot; &#x27;mouth&#x27;. Ostia is now a large archaeological site noted for the excellent preservation of its ancient buildings, magnificent frescoes and impressive mosaics. The city&#x27;s decline after antiquity led to harbor deterioration, marshy conditions, and reduced population. Sand dunes covering the site aided its preservation. Its remains provide insights into a city of commercial importance. As in Pompeii, Ostia&#x27;s ruins provide details about Roman urbanism that are not accessible within the city of Rome itself. Post-classical Swahili kingdoms are known to have had trade port islands and trade routes with the Islamic world and Asia. They were described by Greek historians as &quot;metropolises&quot;. Famous African trade ports such as Mombasa, Zanzibar, Mogadishu and Kilwa were known to Chinese sailors such as Zheng He and medieval Islamic historians such as the Berber Islamic voyager Abu Abdullah ibn Battuta.

Many of these ancient sites no longer exist or function as modern ports. Even in more recent times, ports sometimes fall out of use. Rye, East Sussex, was an important English port in the Middle Ages, but the coastline changed and it is now from the sea, while the ports of Ravenspurn and Dunwich have been lost to coastal erosion.
The maritime republics (), also called merchant republics (), were Italian thalassocratic port cities which, starting from the Middle Ages, enjoyed political autonomy and economic prosperity brought about by their maritime activities. The term, coined during the 19th century, generally refers to four Italian cities, whose coats of arms have been shown since 1947 on the flags of the Italian Navy and the Italian Merchant Navy: Amalfi, Genoa, Pisa, and Venice. In addition to the four best known cities, Ancona, Gaeta, Noli, and, in Dalmatia, Ragusa, are also considered maritime republics; in certain historical periods, they had no secondary importance compared to some of the better known cities.

Uniformly scattered across the Italian peninsula, the maritime republics were important not only for the history of navigation and commerce: in addition to precious goods otherwise unobtainable in Europe, new artistic ideas and news concerning distant countries also spread. From the 10th century, they built fleets of ships both for their own protection and to support extensive trade networks across the Mediterranean, giving them an essential role in reestablishing contacts between Europe, Asia, and Africa, which had been interrupted during the early Middle Ages. They also had an essential role in the Crusades and produced renowned explorers and navigators such as Marco Polo and Christopher Columbus.

Over the centuries, the maritime republics — both the best known and the lesser known but not always less important — experienced fluctuating fortunes. In the 9th and 10th centuries, this phenomenon began with Amalfi and Gaeta, which soon reached their heyday. Meanwhile, Venice began its gradual ascent, while the other cities were still experiencing the long gestation that would lead them to their autonomy and to follow up on their seafaring vocation. After the 11th century, Amalfi and Gaeta declined rapidly, while Genoa and Venice became the most powerful republics. Pisa followed and experienced its most flourishing period in the 13th century, and Ancona and Ragusa allied to resist Venetian power. Following the 14th century, while Pisa declined to the point of losing its autonomy, Venice and Genoa continued to dominate navigation, followed by Ragusa and Ancona, which experienced their golden age in the 15th century. In the 16th century, with Ancona&#x27;s loss of autonomy, only the republics of Venice, Genoa, and Ragusa remained, which still experienced great moments of splendor until the mid-17th century, followed by over a century of slow decline that ended with the Napoleonic invasion.

==Modern ports==

Whereas early ports tended to be just simple harbours, modern ports tend to be multimodal distribution hubs, with transport links using sea, river, canal, road, rail and air routes. Successful ports are located to optimize access to an active hinterland, such as the London Gateway. Ideally, a port will grant easy navigation to ships, and will give shelter from wind and waves. Ports are often on estuaries, where the water may be shallow and may need regular dredging. Deep water ports such as Milford Haven are less common, but can handle larger ships with a greater draft, such as super tankers, Post-Panamax vessels and large container ships. Other businesses such as regional distribution centres, warehouses and freight-forwarders, canneries and other processing facilities find it advantageous to be located within a port or nearby. Modern ports will have specialised cargo-handling equipment, such as gantry cranes, reach stackers and forklift trucks. 

Ports usually have specialised functions: some tend to cater mainly for passenger ferries and cruise ships; some specialise in container traffic or general cargo; and some ports play an important military role for their nation&#x27;s navy. Some third world countries and small islands such as Ascension and St Helena still have limited port facilities, so that ships must anchor off while their cargo and passengers are taken ashore by barge or launch (respectively).

In modern times, ports survive or decline, depending on current economic trends. In the UK, both the ports of Liverpool and Southampton were once significant in the transatlantic passenger liner business. Once airliner traffic decimated that trade, both ports diversified to container cargo and cruise ships. Up until the 1950s the Port of London was a major international port on the River Thames, but changes in shipping and the use of containers and larger ships have led to its decline. Thamesport, a small semi-automated container port (with links to the Port of Felixstowe, the UK&#x27;s largest container port) thrived for some years, but has been hit hard by competition from the emergent London Gateway port and logistics hub.

In mainland Europe, it is normal for ports to be publicly owned, so that, for instance, the ports of Rotterdam and Amsterdam are owned partly by the state and partly by the cities themselves.

Even though modern ships tend to have bow-thrusters and stern-thrusters, many port authorities still require vessels to use pilots and tugboats for manoeuvering large ships in tight quarters. For instance, ships approaching the Belgian port of Antwerp, an inland port on the River Scheldt, are obliged to use Dutch pilots when navigating on that part of the estuary that belongs to the Netherlands.

Ports with international traffic have customs facilities.

==Types==
The terms &quot;port&quot; and &quot;seaport&quot; are used for different types of facilities handling ocean-going vessels, and river port is used for river traffic, such as barges and other shallow-draft vessels.

===Inland port===
An inland port is a port on a navigable lake, river (fluvial port), or canal with access to a sea or ocean, which therefore allows a ship to sail from the ocean inland to the port to load or unload its cargo. An example of this is the St. Lawrence Seaway which allows ships to travel from the Atlantic Ocean several thousand kilometers inland to Great Lakes ports like Toronto, Duluth-Superior, and Chicago. The term &quot;inland port&quot; is also used for dry ports.

===Seaport===
A seaport is a port located on the shore of a sea or ocean. It is further categorized as commercial and non-commercial:

*Commercial ones includes &quot;cruise ports&quot; and &quot;cargo ports&quot;. Additionally, &quot;cruise ports&quot; are also known as a &quot;home port&quot; or a &quot;port of call&quot;; and &quot;cargo port&quot; is also further categorized into a &quot;bulk&quot; or &quot;break bulk port&quot; or as a &quot;container port&quot;.

*Non-commercial seaports are marina and fishing ports.

====Cargo port====
Cargo ports are quite different from cruise ports, because each handles very different cargo, which has to be loaded and unloaded by a variety of mechanical means. 

Bulk cargo ports may handle one particular type of cargo or numerous cargoes, such as grains, liquid fuels, liquid chemicals, wood, automobiles, etc. Such ports are known as the &quot;bulk&quot; or &quot;break bulk ports&quot;. 

Ports that handle containerized cargo are known as container ports. 

Most cargo ports handle all sorts of cargo, but some ports are very specific as to what cargo they handle. Additionally, individual cargo ports may be divided into different operating terminals which handle the different types of cargoes, and may be operated by different companies, also known as terminal operators, or stevedores.

====Cruise port====
A cruise home port is the port where cruise ship passengers board (or embark) to start their cruise and disembark the cruise ship at the end of their cruise. It is also where the cruise ship&#x27;s supplies are loaded for the cruise, which includes everything from fresh water and fuel to fruits, vegetables, champagne, and any other supplies needed for the cruise. &quot;Cruise home ports&quot; are very busy places during the day the cruise ship is in port, because off-going passengers debark their baggage and on-coming passengers board the ship in addition to all the supplies being loaded. Cruise home ports tend to have large passenger terminals to handle the large number of passengers passing through the port. The busiest cruise home port in the world is the Port of Miami, Florida.

====Port of call====
A port of call is an intermediate stop for a ship on its sailing itinerary. At these ports, cargo ships may take on supplies or fuel, as well as unloading and loading cargo while cruise liners have passengers get on or off ship.

===Fishing port===
A fishing port is a port or harbor for landing and distributing fish. It may be a recreational facility, but it is usually commercial. A fishing port is the only port that depends on an ocean product, and depletion of fish may cause a fishing port to be uneconomical.

===Marina===
A marina is a port for recreational boating.

===Warm-water port===
A warm-water port (also known as an ice-free port) is one where the water does not freeze in winter. This is mainly used in the context of countries with mostly cold winters where parts of the coastline freezes over every winter. Because they are available year-round, warm-water ports can be of great geopolitical or economic interest. Such settlements as Narvik in Norway, Dalian in China, Murmansk, Novorossiysk, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and Vostochny Port in Russia, Odesa in Ukraine, Kushiro in Japan and Valdez at the terminus of the Alaska Pipeline owe their very existence to being ice-free ports. The Baltic Sea and similar areas have ports available year-round beginning in the 20th century thanks to icebreakers, but earlier access problems prompted Russia to expand its territory to the Black Sea.

===Dry port===

A dry port is an inland intermodal terminal directly connected by road or rail to a seaport and operating as a centre for the transshipment of sea cargo to inland destinations.

===Smart port===

A smart port uses technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) to be more efficient at handling goods. Smart ports usually deploy cloud-based software as part of the process of greater automation to help generate the operating flow that helps the port work smoothly. At present, most of the world&#x27;s ports have somewhat embedded technology, if not for full leadership. However, thanks to global government initiatives and exponential growth in maritime trade, the number of intelligent ports has gradually increased. A report by business intelligence provider Visiongain assessed that Smart Ports Market spending would reach $1.5 bn in 2019.

==Environmental issues==

Ports and their operation are often a cause of environmental issues, such as sediment contamination and spills from ships and are susceptible to larger environmental issues, such as human caused climate change and its effects.

===Dredging===

Every year 100 million cubic metres of marine sediment are dredged to improve waterways around ports. Dredging, in its practice, disturbs local ecosystems, brings sediments into the water column, and can stir up pollutants captured in the sediments.

===Invasive species===
Invasive species are often spread by the bilge water and species attached to the hulls of ships. It is estimated that there are over 7000 invasive species transported in bilge water around the world on a daily basis Invasive species can have direct or indirect interactions with native sea life. Direct interaction such as predation, is when a native species with no natural predator is all of a sudden prey of an invasive specie. Indirect interaction can be diseases or other health conditions brought by invasive species.
===Air pollution===
Ports are also a source of increased air pollution as a result of ships and land transportation at the port. Transportation corridors around ports have higher exhaust emissions and this can have related health effects on local communities.

===Water quality===
Water quality around ports is often lower because of both direct and indirect pollution from the shipping, and other challenges caused by the port&#x27;s community, such as trash washing into the ocean.

====Spills, pollution and contamination====
Sewage from ships, and leaks of oil and chemicals from shipping vessels can contaminate local water, and cause other effects like nutrient pollution in the water.

===Climate change and sea level rise===
Ports and their infrastructure are very vulnerable to climate change and sea level rise, because many of them are in low-lying areas designed for status quo water levels. Variable weather, coastal erosion, and sea level rise all put pressure on existing infrastructure, resulting in subsidence, coastal flooding and other direct pressures on the port.

===Reducing impact===
There are several initiatives to decrease negative environmental impacts of ports. The World Port Sustainability Program points to all of the Sustainable Development Goals as potential ways of addressing port sustainability. These include SIMPYC, the World Ports Climate Initiative, the African Green Port Initiative, EcoPorts and Green Marine.

==World&#x27;s major ports==
===Africa===
*The port of Tangier Med is the largest port on the Mediterranean and in Africa by capacity and went into service in July 2007.
*The busiest port in Africa is Port Said in Egypt.

===Asia===
The port of Shanghai is the largest port in the world in both cargo tonnage and activity. It regained its position as the world&#x27;s busiest port by cargo tonnage and the world&#x27;s busiest container port in 2009 and 2010, respectively. It is followed by the ports of Singapore, Hong Kong and Kaohsiung, Taiwan, all of which are in East and Southeast Asia.

The port of Singapore is the world&#x27;s second-busiest port in terms of total shipping tonnage, it also transships a third of the world&#x27;s shipping containers, half of the world&#x27;s annual supply of crude oil, and is the world&#x27;s busiest transshipment port.

===Europe===

Europe&#x27;s busiest container port and biggest port by cargo tonnage by far is the Port of Rotterdam, in the Netherlands. It is followed by the Belgian Port of Antwerp or the German Port of Hamburg, depending on which metric is used. In turn, the Spanish Port of Valencia is the busiest port in the Mediterranean basin, while the Portuguese Port of Sines is the busiest atlantic port. The Port of Trieste, Italy, is the main port of the northern Adriatic and starting point of the Transalpine Pipeline.

===North America===

The largest ports include the Port of South Louisiana, a vast sprawling port centered in the New Orleans area, Houston, Port of New York/New Jersey, Los Angeles in the U.S., Manzanillo in Mexico and Vancouver in Canada. Panama also has the Panama Canal that connects the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean, and is a key conduit for international trade.

===Oceania===
The largest port in Oceania is the Port of Melbourne.

===South America===
According to ECLAC&#x27;s &quot;Maritime and Logistics Profile of Latin America and the Caribbean&quot;, the largest ports in South America are the Port of Santos in Brazil, Cartagena in Colombia, Callao in Peru, Guayaquil in Ecuador, and the Port of Buenos Aires in Argentina.

<doc id="97172" wikidata="Q1286157" url="?curid=97172" title="Question time">
<text>A question time in a parliament occurs when members of the parliament ask questions of government ministers (including the prime minister), which they are obliged to answer. It usually occurs daily while parliament is sitting, though it can be cancelled in exceptional circumstances. Question time originated in the Westminster system of the United Kingdom, and occurs in other countries, mostly Commonwealth countries, who use the system.

In practice, the questions asked in question time are often pre-arranged by the organisers of each party, although the questions are usually without notice. Questions from government backbenchers are either intended to allow the Minister to discuss the virtues of government policy, or to attack the opposition.

==Westminster system==

===Australia===

Question time, formally known as &quot;questions without notice&quot;, is an institution in the Commonwealth Parliament and in all state parliaments. Questions to government ministers normally alternate between government members and the opposition, with the opposition going first. Questions of ministers are generally asked by their counterpart shadow ministers (or in the case of a minister and corresponding shadow minister are each members of a different House of Parliament, then the shadow minister&#x27;s representative in the other House asked questions to the relevant minister) in the opposition, and are always asked by backbenchers on the government side. In the House of Representatives, the first question is usually asked of the prime minister by the Leader of the Opposition. Similar arrangements apply in the Senate. To accommodate the distribution of ministers between both chambers, ministers also take on representative roles, answering questions relating to portfolios that are not their own because the responsible minister sits in the other chamber. This allows questioners to ask questions about any government portfolio in either chamber. This normally includes the Leader of the Government in the Senate representing the prime minister in response to questions asked by senators about general government policy. Sometimes a government Minister will arrange for a government backbencher to &quot;ask&quot; a question, commonly called a Dorothy Dixer, to enable the Minister to make a political speech or otherwise score political points.

Convention allows the prime minister in the House, and the Leader of the Government in the Senate, to terminate question time by asking that &quot;further questions be placed on the Notice Paper&quot;. This is not a formal motion but an indication that, even if further questions were asked, ministers would not answer them since they are not compelled to do so. It is possible in this way to prematurely terminate question time, although this is rare in the House and essentially unheard of in the Senate. During the Keating Government, the prime minister attempted to limit the number of questions asked in a way the Liberal Opposition disapproved of. To protest the change, the Opposition made random quorum calls through the afternoon for every question they felt they had been denied that day. In the House, question time is generally scheduled from 2pm to 3:15 pm on every sitting day; in the Senate, it generally occurs from 2pm to 3pm. Apart from divisions, it is the only time the chamber is likely to be filled.

Tactically, it is considered an important defining characteristic for an Opposition Leader to be able ask a pertinent question of the prime minister or premier, or to single out perceived weak performers in the Ministry.

Interjections from both government and opposition members in the House of Representatives and the Senate are common, and broadly speaking are an accepted practice, although the speaker of the House or the president of the Senate will intervene if interjections become too frequent, if they contain inappropriate content, or if the member interjecting is disrupting debate. Given that question time is the only time of day when all members of Parliament are in their respective chambers, the appearance of question time can be rowdy and boisterous compared to the normally sedate activity during the rest of the day.

There is a 30-second time limit for questions by the Opposition and a four-minute time limit for answers in the House of Representatives. Crossbench MPs get a time limit of 30 seconds, the same as Government and Opposition members. This was reduced from 45 seconds when the standing orders were amended on 2 August 2022. In the Senate, a questioner may ask an initial question and two supplementary questions related to their initial question. Each question has a one-minute time limit. Answers to initial questions are limited to three minutes, and answers to supplementary questions are limited to one minute. A senator may also move to &#x27;take note&#x27; of a minister&#x27;s answer after question time, allowing questioners (generally Opposition senators) to respond to the answers provided by ministers.

It is very common for points of order to be raised during question time on the issue of relevance, as a Minister answering questions will normally attempt to redirect the answer to an attack on their opponents. However, as long as the Minister is talking on the general subject of the matter raised in the question, it is usually considered relevant to the question, even if it does not address the specific issue raised in the question at all.

State parliaments adopt similar practices to the federal Parliament with the exception of the Parliament of Victoria, where, since 2015, government backbenchers are no longer entitled to ask questions during question time. As a replacement, ministers can make two-minute ministerial statements to the chamber (see Dorothy Dixer).

Question time has been broadcast on ABC Radio since 1946 and televised since 1991 by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

There is a common misperception that question time is about asking questions to ministers as there are uncommon occurrences of questions being asked to members of Parliament who are not ministers.

===Canada===

Question time in the House of Commons of Canada, colloquially referred to as &quot;Question Period&quot;, and formally known as &quot;Oral Questions&quot;, occurs during each sitting day in the House of Commons. The questions may be posed to either the prime minister of Canada, or any minister of the Cabinet of Canada.

In addition to the House of Commons of Canada, question period is also a convention that is practiced in the various legislative bodies of the provinces and territories of Canada. Like the federal House of Commons, Question Period in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, Legislative Assembly of Manitoba, and the Legislative Assembly of Ontario is formally known as Oral Questions. In the Quebec National Assembly, the practice is called &quot;Oral Questions and Answers&quot;.

===India===
===Ireland===
In the Oireachtas, Ireland&#x27;s parliament, questions are asked in Dáil Éireann, the lower house, to which the government of Ireland is responsible. The Ceann Comhairle (speaker) has wide discretion on allowing questions, which are directed to the minister in charge of the relevant Department of State. A question may be answered by any cabinet minister due to cabinet collective responsibility, or by a (non-cabinet) Minister of State at the relevant Department of State. Questions requiring departmental research may not have an answer available within the three-day notice period; these tend to be submitted for written rather than oral response. The Ceann Comhairle may permit a supplementary question to an oral response. Reforms in 2016 at the start of the 32nd Dáil created separate time slots for different types of question, and empower the Ceann Comhairle to demand a further response if the initial one is deemed inadequate.

===Japan===

The Diet of Japan held its first on 10 November 1999; the first question asked to Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was &quot;Prime Minister, what did you have for breakfast this morning?&quot;. Japan&#x27;s question time was closely modeled after that of the UK, and many Diet members travelled to the House of Commons to study the British application of the concept.

Question time is 45 minutes long and questions are limited to the leaders of parliamentary caucuses (which must consist of at least ten members of either house). Although it is generally held every week while the Diet is in session, it may be cancelled with the agreement of the opposition: this often happens during the budgeting period and at other times when the prime minister must sit in the Diet.

===Malaysia===

Speaker Johari Abdul of the Dewan Rakyat, the elected house of the Parliament of Malaysia, announced in February 2023 that the upcoming sitting would see the introduction of both Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions and Minister&#x27;s Questions: &quot;We suggest that the session be held every Tuesday for Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to answer questions that are addressed to him and on Thursday, there will be the Minister&#x27;s Question Time (MQT) session.&quot; He described this as a pilot, and said that amendments to the house&#x27;s standing orders would be required to make question time a regular part of parliamentary proceedings.

===New Zealand===

====Oral questions====
Questions asked to ministers must be concise and related to the area of the minister&#x27;s responsibility. Questions require that all facts be authenticated. Before a question is asked it is checked that it meets the requirements of the House&#x27;s standing orders, before being transmitted to the relevant ministers.

In New Zealand oral questions are asked at 2pm on each sitting day. Twelve principal oral questions are asked, with supplementary questions also given that must relate to the initial subject matter. The opportunity to ask questions is equally shared amongst the members of the house, excluding ministers. Urgent questions, while possible, are uncommon.

The question is addressed to the portfolio of the minister receiving the question, and the questioner must ask the question as written. Once a question is asked, supplementary questions can be asked.

SKY News New Zealand broadcasts this session from 2pm to the conclusion of questioning. Also, New Zealand&#x27;s free-to-air digital television network, Freeview, provides live coverage of the debating chamber when it is in session on Parliament TV.

====Written questions====
There is no limit to the written questions that any MP can ask and can be submitted each working day before 10.30am. Submission and publication of the question is an electronic process with no hard copy record. Ministers have 6 days to respond to a question.

===Singapore===

Each day that the Parliament of Singapore sits has the first one and a half hours of the meeting allocated to Question Time. MPs submit questions in advance, and only questions listed on the Order Paper for the sitting day may be dealt with during Question Time. Questions which are not dealt with during the sitting may be &quot;rolled over&quot; to another sitting day, or answered in writing. After a question is answered orally in Parliament, MPs may raise supplementary questions. According to Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin, the sequencing of questions for Question Time is entirely at the Speaker&#x27;s discretion: &quot;As Speaker, I will decide the sequence of PQs on the Order Paper for a Sitting. No strict formula is involved, other than exercising reasonable judgement.&quot; Describing his approach to presiding over Question Time, Tan has said: &quot;I will be permissive and expansive where possible to optimise productive exchanges. For instance, after the Minister’s verbal reply, I will let MPs continue asking Supplementary Questions (SQs) for further clarifications. I will remind both front and back benches to say more with less, so that as many MPs who wish to ask SQs can do so.&quot; He has called the tone of Singaporean Question Time &quot;more measured&quot; compared to similar proceedings in other countries.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, question time in the House of Commons, officially titled Oral Answers to Questions, lasts for an hour each day from Monday to Thursday (2:30 to 3:30pm on Mondays, 11:30am to 12:30pm on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and 9:30 to 10:30am on Thursdays). Each Government department has its place in a rota which repeats every four to five weeks when the House is sitting. The larger Departments generally have the full hour for oral questions whereas smaller Departments will have less time allocated. In addition, Questions to the Prime Minister takes place each Wednesday from noon to 12:30pm, and questions are asked each Thursday (Questions to the Leader of House of Commons), about the business of the House the following week. 

The larger departments also have a Topical question period for the last 15 minutes of their hour for questions, where the Secretary of State outlines recent developments in their department and then backbench MPs can ask any question relating to their department, for which ministers are not given prior notice. Topical questions have been part of each question time in the Commons since November 2007. For question time, Government whips organize &quot;support groups&quot; of government MPs whose duty it is to support the ministers who answer questions by asking questions helpful to the government and shouting in its support.

In addition to government departments, there are also questions regarding the Church of England, House of Commons reform and Law Rulings.

Questions for oral answer are selected by ballot a few days before the question time takes place and published. Ministers therefore have advance warning of the initial questions, but after each question has been answered, the MP in whose name it appears may ask a supplementary question on the same subject area for which no notice is given (unless the MP chooses to do so privately). The Speaker will usually call other MPs to ask further supplementary questions and this will often include Opposition front bench spokespersons. A second ballot enables MPs to put forward their names to ask a topical question for which no notice is required.

Questions to the prime minister are usually tabled on a topical basis so that the name of the MP is published but not the question itself.

Additionally, each Member of Parliament is entitled to table an unlimited number of written questions. Usually a Private Member directs a question to a Secretary of State, and it is usually answered by a Minister of State or Parliamentary Under Secretary of State. Written Questions are submitted to the Clerks of the Table Office, either on paper or electronically, and are recorded in &quot;The Official Report (Hansard)&quot; so as to be widely available and accessible.

In the House of Lords, half an hour is put aside each afternoon at the start of the day&#x27;s proceedings for &quot;Lords Questions&quot;. A peer submits a query in advance, which then appears on the Order Paper for the day&#x27;s proceedings. The Lord shall say: &quot;My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper&quot;. The Minister responsible then answers the query. Afterwards, for around ten minutes, any Lord can ask the Minister questions on the theme of the original put down on the order paper. (For instance, if the question regards immigration, Lords can ask the Minister any question related to immigration during the allowed period). The Lords usually do not have a call list, as the Commons does, so Peers rise to ask a question themselves and they alternate between the Government, opposition and crossbench sides of the chamber. Unlike the Commons, where only the Speaker can call a member to order, any Lord can call any other Lord to order, and on many occasions noble Lords intervene to ensure fair distribution of questions around the chamber. If unable to settle who the next speaker is, usually the Leader of the House will intervene. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, call lists had been in use in the Lords from April 2020 to December 2021 as some Peers participated virtually. A peer may also table up to six questions for written answer on any day the House is sitting.

==European Parliament==
==Finland==
In Finland&#x27;s parliament Question hour (&quot;kyselytunti&quot;) is held every Thursday from 4 to 5 p.m. It consists of the Speaker of Parliament to giving all parliamentary groups the opportunity to put at least one question to the prime minister of Finland and his/her ministers. It is broadcast live on public television, particularly on Yle TV1.

==Germany==
Government ministers are made available to the Bundestag for 35 minutes each Wednesday after the weekly cabinet meeting, during which time they take questions on current matters before the government. This is followed by a further two-hour question-and-answer session consisting of questions that were submitted in advance in writing.

==Hong Kong==
The questions in the Legislative Council are aimed at seeking information on government actions on specific problems or incidents and on government policies, for the purpose of monitoring the effectiveness of the government.

Questions may be asked at any council meeting except the first meeting of a session, a meeting at which the president (the speaker) of the council is elected, or the Chief Executive delivers the annual policy address to the Council.

No more than 22 questions, excluding urgent questions that may be permitted by the president, may be asked at any one meeting. Replies to questions may be given by designated public officers, usually secretaries, orally or in written form. For questions seeking oral replies, supplementary questions may be put by any member when called upon by the president of the council for the purpose of elucidating that answer. Where there is no debate on a motion with no legislative effect at a meeting, no more than ten questions requiring oral replies may be asked; otherwise, no more than six questions may require an oral reply.

The Chief Executive, who is the head of the region and head of government, attends Question and Answer Session of the council which are held several times in a legislative year. This was introduced to the Legislative Council in 1992 by the Governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten as Governor&#x27;s Question Time.

==United States==
The United States, which has a presidential system of government, does not have a question time for the president. However, Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution of the United States states: &quot;[The president] shall from time to time give to Congress information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.&quot; The exact meaning of this clause has never been worked out fully, although it is the constitutional basis for the modern State of the Union address. There was some discussion at various times about whether this clause would allow something similar to a Westminster style question time – for instance, having Department Secretaries being questioned by the House of Representatives or the Senate – but the discussions on this issue have never gotten past an exploratory stage.

President George H. W. Bush once said of PMQs, &quot;I count my blessings for the fact I don&#x27;t have to go into that pit that John Major stands in, nose-to-nose with the opposition, all yelling at each other.&quot; In 2008, Senator John McCain (Republican Party nominee for president of the United States in the 2008 presidential election) stated his intention, if elected, to create a presidential equivalent of the British conditional convention of Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions. In a policy speech on 15 May 2008, which outlined a number of ideas, McCain said, &quot;I will ask Congress to grant me the privilege of coming before both houses to take questions, and address criticism, much the same as the Prime Minister of Great Britain appears regularly before the House of Commons.&quot;

George F. Will of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; criticized the proposal in an op-ed piece, saying that a presidential question time would endanger separation of powers as the president of the United States, unlike the prime minister of the United Kingdom, is not a member of the legislature. Will ended the piece by saying, &quot;Congress should remind a President McCain that the 16 blocks separating the Capitol from the White House nicely express the nation&#x27;s constitutional geography.&quot;

In February 2009, just over a month after his inauguration, President Barack Obama invited serving members of the US Senate to a &quot;fiscal responsibility&quot; summit at the White House, during which Senators asked the president about his fiscal policies in an event which was compared to Prime Minister&#x27;s Question. Eleven months later, Republican House Minority Leader John Boehner invited Obama to the annual House Issues Conference in Baltimore, Maryland, where the president answered questions and criticisms from Republican members of Congress. Commenting on the event, Peter Baker in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said &quot;[the] back and forth resembled the British tradition where the prime minister submits to questions on the floor of the House of Commons – something Senator John McCain had promised to do if elected president.&quot;

==Hungary==
In Hungary&#x27;s Parliament, the hour of immediate questions &quot;(azonnali kérdések órája)&quot; is held once every week when the National Assembly is in session, for at least 60 minutes. At least one representative from each parliamentary group may ask the Prime Minister or any other member of the government a question. In the first round, opposition groups ask their questions first, in descending order of their number of representatives, then the ruling parties. In the second round, any representative may ask a question, though in practice, there rarely is a second round, so all parties usually ask only one question per session. Although the topic of all questions must be submitted in advance, the Prime Minister does not know the specific content of the question before it is asked (usually the titles are very vague, mostly along the lines of &quot;What do you think about this, Mr. Prime Minister?&quot;, thus the ministers don&#x27;t usually have an opportunity to prepare in advance). 2 minutes are available for both the asking and the answering of a question, after which the member of parliament has 1 minute to reply, then so does the minister being asked.

<doc id="97177" wikidata="Q464227" url="?curid=97177" title="Nefertem">
<text>Nefertem (; possibly &quot;beautiful one who closes&quot; or &quot;one who does not close&quot;; also spelled Nefertum or Nefer-temu) was, in Egyptian mythology, originally a lotus flower at the creation of the world, who had arisen from the primal waters. 
Nefertem represented both the first sunlight and the delightful smell of the Egyptian blue lotus flower, having arisen from the primal waters within an Egyptian blue water-lily, &quot;Nymphaea caerulea&quot;. Some of the titles of Nefertem were &quot;He Who is Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Water-Lily of the Sun&quot;, and a version of the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; says:
Nefertem was eventually seen as the son of the creator god Ptah, and the goddesses Sekhmet and Bast were sometimes called his mother. In art, Nefertem is usually depicted as a beautiful young man having blue water-lily flowers around his head. As the son of Bastet, he also sometimes has the head of a lion or is a lion or cat reclining. The ancient Egyptians often carried small statuettes of him as good-luck charms.

One of the most notable depictions of Nefertem is the Head of Nefertem, a wooden bust depicting a young king Tutankhamun as Nefertem with his head emerging from a lotus flower.

<text>Bastet (), also known as Ubasti, or Bubastis, is a goddess of ancient Egyptian religion possibly of Nubian origin, worshipped as early as the Second Dynasty (2890 BC). In ancient Greek religion, she was known as Ailuros ().

Bastet was worshipped in Bubastis in Lower Egypt, originally as a lioness goddess, a role shared by other deities such as Sekhmet. Eventually Bastet and Sekhmet were characterized as two aspects of the same goddess, with Sekhmet representing the powerful warrior and protector aspect, and Bastet, who increasingly was depicted as a cat, representing a gentler aspect.

==Name==
Bastet, the form of the name that is most commonly adopted by Egyptologists today because of its use in later dynasties, is a modern convention offering one possible reconstruction. In early Egyptian hieroglyphs, her name appears to have been &quot;bꜣstt&quot;. James Peter Allen vocalizes the original form of the name as &quot;buʔístit&quot; or &quot;buʔístiat&quot;, with ʔ representing a glottal stop. In Middle Egyptian writing, the second &quot;t&quot; marks a feminine ending but usually was not pronounced, and the aleph &quot;ꜣ&quot; () may have moved to a position before the accented syllable, &quot;ꜣbst&quot;. By the first millennium, then, &quot;bꜣstt&quot; would have been something like &quot;*Ubaste&quot; (&lt; &quot;*Ubastat&quot;) in Egyptian speech, later becoming Coptic &quot;Oubaste&quot;. The name is rendered in Phoenician as 𐤀𐤁𐤎𐤕, ’bst, or 𐤁𐤎𐤕, bst.
What the name of the goddess means remains uncertain. Names of ancient Egyptian deities often were represented as references to associations or with euphemisms, being cult secrets. One recent suggestion by Stephen Quirke (&quot;Ancient Egyptian Religion&quot;) explains Bastet as meaning, &quot;She of the ointment jar&quot;. This ties in with the observation that her name was written with the hieroglyph for &quot;ointment jar&quot; (&quot;bꜣs&quot;) and that she was associated with protective ointments, among other things. The name of the material known as &quot;alabaster&quot; might, through Greek, come from the name of the goddess. This association would have come about much later than when the goddess was a protective lioness goddess, however, and is useful only in deciphering the origin of the term, alabaster.James P. Allen instead derives the name as a nisba construction from a place name &quot;Baset&quot; (&quot;bꜣst&quot;) with the meaning &quot;she of &quot;bꜣst&quot;&quot;.

==Role in ancient Egypt==
Bastet was originally a fierce lioness warrior goddess of the sun, worshipped throughout most of ancient Egyptian history. Later she became the cat goddess that is familiar today. She was then depicted as the daughter of Ra and Isis, and the consort of Ptah, with whom she had a son, Maahes.

As protector of Lower Egypt, she was seen as defender of the king, and consequently of the sun god, Ra. Along with other deities such as Hathor, Sekhmet, and Isis, Bastet was associated with the Eye of Ra. She has been depicted as fighting the evil snake named Apep, an enemy of Ra. In addition to her solar connections, she was also related to Wadjet, one of the oldest Egyptian goddesses from the Southern Delta who was dubbed &quot;eye of the moon&quot;.

Bastet was also a goddess of pregnancy and childbirth, possibly because of the fertility of the domestic cat.

Images of Bastet were often created from alabaster. The goddess was sometimes depicted holding a ceremonial sistrum in one hand and an aegis in the other—the aegis usually resembling a collar or gorget, embellished with a lioness head.

Bastet was also depicted as the goddess of protection against contagious diseases and evil spirits.

==History==

Bastet first appears in the third millennium BCE, where she is depicted as either a fierce lioness or a woman with the head of a lioness. Two thousand years later, during the Third Intermediate Period of Egypt (–712 BC), Bastet began to be depicted as a domestic cat or a cat-headed woman.

Scribes of the New Kingdom and later eras began referring to her with an additional feminine suffix, as &quot;Bastet&quot;. The name change is thought to have been added to emphasize pronunciation of the ending &quot;t&quot; sound, often left silent.

Cats in ancient Egypt were highly revered, partly due to their ability to combat vermin such as mice, rats (which threatened key food supplies), and snakes—especially cobras. Cats of royalty were, in some instances, known to be dressed in golden jewelry and were allowed to eat from the plates of their owners. Dennis C. Turner and Patrick Bateson estimate that during the Twenty-second Dynasty (), Bastet worship changed from being a lioness deity into being predominantly a major cat deity. Because domestic cats tend to be tender and protective of their offspring, Bastet was also regarded as a good mother and sometimes was depicted with numerous kittens.

The native Egyptian rulers were replaced by Greeks during an occupation of Ancient Egypt in the Ptolemaic Dynasty that lasted almost 300 years. The Greeks sometimes equated Bastet with one of their goddesses, Artemis. Bastet was depicted by Egyptians with the head of a cat and the slender body of a woman. Sometimes, Bastet was venerated as just a cat head.
==Bubastis==

Bastet was a local deity whose religious sect was centered in the city in the Nile Delta later named Bubastis. It lay near what is known today as Zagazig. The town, known in Egyptian as &quot;pr-bꜣstt&quot; (also transliterated as &quot;Per-Bastet&quot;), carries her name, literally meaning &quot;House of Bastet&quot;. It was known in Greek as &quot;Boubastis&quot; (&quot;Βούβαστις&quot;) and translated into Hebrew as &quot;Pî-beset&quot;, spelled without the initial &quot;t&quot; sound of the last syllable. In the biblical Book of Ezekiel 30:17, the town appears in the Hebrew form &quot;Pibeseth&quot;.

===Temple===

Herodotus, an ancient Greek historian who traveled in Egypt in the fifth century BCE, describes Bastet&#x27;s temple at some length:
This description by Herodotus and several Egyptian texts suggest that water surrounded the temple on three (out of four) sides, forming a type of lake known as &quot;isheru&quot;, not too dissimilar from that surrounding the temple of the mother goddess Mut in Karnak at Thebes. These lakes were typical components of temples devoted to a number of lioness goddesses, who are said to represent one original goddess, Bastet, Mut, Tefnut, Hathor, and Sakhmet, and came to be associated with sun gods such as Horus and Ra as well as the Eye of Ra. Each of them had to be appeased by a specific set of rituals. One myth relates that a lioness, fiery and wrathful, was once cooled down by the water of the lake, transformed into a gentle cat, and settled in the temple.

At the Bubastis temple, some cats were found to have been mummified and buried, many next to their owners. More than 300,000 mummified cats were discovered when Bastet&#x27;s temple was excavated. Turner and Bateson suggest that the status of the cat was roughly equivalent to that of the cow in modern India. The death of a cat might leave a family in great mourning and those who could, would have them embalmed or buried in cat cemeteries—pointing to the great prevalence of the cult of Bastet. Extensive burials of cat remains were found not only at Bubastis, but also at Beni Hasan and Saqqara. In 1888, a farmer uncovered a burial site of many hundreds of thousands of cats in Beni Hasan.

===Festival===
Herodotus also relates that of the many solemn festivals held in Egypt, the most important and most popular one was that celebrated in Bubastis in honor of this goddess. Each year on the day of her festival, the town was said to have attracted some 700,000 visitors, both men and women (but not children), who arrived in numerous crowded ships. The women engaged in music, song, and dance on their way to the place. Great sacrifices were made and prodigious amounts of wine were drunk—more than was the case throughout the year. This accords well with Egyptian sources that prescribe that lioness goddesses are to be appeased with the &quot;feasts of drunkenness&quot;. A festival of Bastet was known to be celebrated during the New Kingdom at Bubastis. The block statue from the eighteenth dynasty () of Nefer-ka, the wab-priest of Sekhmet, provides written evidence for this. The inscription suggests that the king, Amenhotep III, was present at the event and had great offerings made to the deity.

<text>Seker (; also spelled Sokar, and in Greek, Sokaris or Socharis) is a hawk or falcon god of the Memphite necropolis in the Ancient Egyptian religion, who was known as a patron of the living, as well as a god of the dead. He is also in some accounts a solar deity as for The Temple of Seker in Memphis.

== Name ==
Although the meaning of his name remains uncertain, the Egyptians in the Pyramid Texts linked his name to the anguished cry of Osiris to Isis &#x27;Sy-k-ri&#x27; (&#x27;hurry to me&#x27;), or possibly &quot;skr,&quot; meaning &quot;cleaning the mouth&quot;. In the underworld, Seker is strongly linked with two other gods, Ptah the Creator god and chief god of Memphis, and Osiris the god of the dead. In later periods, this connection was expressed as the triple god Ptah-Seker-Osiris.

The Faiyumic Coptic form ⲥⲓⲭⲟⲗ is possibly preserved in a personal name ⲥⲉⲛⲥⲓⲭⲟⲗ, &quot;daughter of Sokar&quot;.

== Appearance ==

Seker was usually depicted as a mummified hawk and sometimes as a mound from which the head of a hawk appears. Here he is called &#x27;he who is on his sand&#x27;. Sometimes, he is shown on his &quot;hennu&quot; barque which was an elaborate sledge for negotiating the sandy necropolis. One of his titles was &#x27;He of Restau&#x27; which means the place of &#x27;openings&#x27; or tomb entrances. Like many other gods, he was often depicted with a &quot;Was&quot;-scepter.

In the New Kingdom &quot;Book of the Underworld&quot;, the &quot;Amduat&quot;, he is shown standing on the back of a serpent between two spread wings; as an expression of freedom this suggests a connection with resurrection or perhaps a satisfactory transit of the underworld. Despite this, the region of the underworld associated with Seker was seen as difficult, sandy terrain called the Imhet (also called Amhet, Ammahet, or Ammehet; meaning &#x27;filled up&#x27;).

== Roles and cults ==
Seker, possibly through his association with Ptah, has a connection with artisans. In the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;, he is said to fashion silver bowls and at Tanis a silver coffin of Sheshonq II has been discovered decorated with the iconography of Seker.

Seker&#x27;s cult centre was in Memphis, and festivals in his honor were held there on the 26th day of the fourth month of the akhet (spring) season. While these festivals took place, devotees would hoe and till the ground, and drive cattle, which suggests that Seker could have had agricultural aspects about him.

Seker is mentioned in &quot;The Journey of Ra&quot;: the myth used to explain what happens during the night when Ra travels through the Underworld. According to the myth, Seker rules the Fifth Kingdom of Night, which is called &quot;Hidden&quot;, and is tasked with punishing the souls of evildoers by throwing them into a boiling lake.

As part of the festivals in akhet, his followers wore strings of onions around their necks, showing the Underworld aspect of him. Onions were used in embalming people - sometimes the skin, sometimes the entire onion. When just the skin was used, it would be placed on the eyes and inside the ears to mask the smell.

Also, the god was depicted as assisting in various tasks such as digging ditches and canals. From the New Kingdom a similar festival was held in Thebes, which rivaled the great Opet Festival.

Other events during the festival including floating a statue of the god on a Henu barque, which was a boat with a high prow shaped like an oryx.

==Popular culture==
In the film &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956), the Pharaoh Rameses II invokes the same deity to bring his deceased firstborn son back to life, while wearing a dark blue robe with a silver bow.

In the show &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, the Goa&#x27;uld villain Sokar is named after Seker. Sokar appears as a powerful and sadistic Goa&#x27;uld who chose the role of the Devil rather than a god like the rest of his species. He is killed when the moon he uses as his own personal version of Hell is blown up, destroying Sokar&#x27;s ship in orbit and Sokar himself.

American technical death metal band Nile wrote the title track of their album “Annihilation of the Wicked” about the domain, occupation, and appearance of Seker. Curiously, the lyrics seem to describe Seker in the form of Seker-Osiris, not Ptah-Seker-Osiris, deliberately excluding the aspects of Ptah. The lyrics call him &quot;ancient and dead&quot;, a trait held by Osiris, but also describe him as being “shunned by Ra,” which would place the Seker they describe in the context of Heliopolis rather than Memphis.

The fantasy role playing game &quot;Advanced Dungeons and Dragons&quot; includes Seker in its 1st edition, &quot;Deities and Demigods&quot;, and the &quot;Legends and Lore&quot; rulebooks. In this setting, Seker is described as the Egyptian lesser god of light and, among other details, he casts rays of light from his hands which destroy all undead. His Alignment is given as Neutral Good, and it is noted he protects Egyptian souls of the same Alignment after their death. No specific mention is made of the later triple persona, though his symbol is given as a hawk-headed mummy holding an ankh, which does at least indirectly suggest the connection.

<text>The Ennead or Great Ennead was a group of nine deities in Egyptian mythology worshipped at Heliopolis: the sun god Atum; his children Shu and Tefnut; their children Geb and Nut; and their children Osiris, Isis, Set, and Nephthys. The Ennead sometimes includes Horus the Elder, an ancient form of the falcon god, not the son of Osiris and Isis.

==Status within ancient Egypt==
The Great Ennead was only one of several such groupings of nine deities in ancient Egypt. Claims to preeminence made by its Heliopolitan priests were not respected throughout Egypt, as each nome typically had its own local deities, whose priests insisted stood above all others; even in the nearby city of Memphis, which along with Heliopolis is contained within the limits of modern Cairo, the priests of Ptah celebrated him as singularly superior to the Nine — In addition to Memphis having its own creation myth, the contemporaneous city of Hermopolis had another creation story, the &quot;Ogdoad&quot;, that accounted for the physical creation of the universe by eight (different) primordial gods.

==Name in Egyptian, Greek, and Latin==
The English name &quot;ennead&quot; is a borrowing via Latin of the Greek name &quot;enneás&quot; (), meaning &quot;the nine&quot;. The term was a calque of the Egyptian name, written &#x27; and also meaning &quot;the Nine&quot;. Its original pronunciation is uncertain, since hieroglyphs do not record vowels, but may have been in Old Egyptian, in Middle Egyptian, and in Late Egyptian. Egyptologists conventionally transcribe it as Pesedjet.

==History==
The ancient Egyptians created several enneads as their unification under brought numerous local cults into contact with one another. The ancient Egyptian mythology often had many different explanations for the same phenomenon. This concept is especially unique because no single story was more accurate than another, but rather the truth was a mix of them all. The Pyramid Texts of Dynasties V and VI mention the &quot;Great Ennead&quot;, the &quot;Lesser Ennead&quot;, the &quot;Dual Ennead&quot;, and the &quot;Seven Enneads&quot;. Some pharaohs established enneads that incorporated themselves as gods. The most notable case is of whose mortuary temple at Redesiyah celebrated an ennead of six major gods and three deified forms of himself. The &quot;ennead&quot; mentioned in the Egyptian calendar of lucky and unlucky days, may reference the Pleiades.

The most important was the &quot;Great&quot; or &quot;Heliopolitan Ennead&quot; of Awanu (), known under the Greeks and Romans as Heliopolis. It celebrated the family of the sun god Atum (sometimes referred to as Atum-re) and thrived from the Old Kingdom to the Ptolemaic period.

Its development remains uncertain, although it appears to have first appeared when Ra&#x27;s cult – supreme under – declined in importance under . Egyptologists have traditionally theorized that the Heliopolitan priesthood established it to establish the preeminence of Atum over the others, incorporating some major gods in lesser positions and omitting others entirely. The most prominent of such deities was Osiris, god of vegetation and the afterlife, who was incorporated into the ennead as Atum&#x27;s great-grandson. However, in the 20th century, some Egyptologists question the whole scenario. After the Great Ennead was well established, the cult of Ra – identified with Atum – recovered much of its importance until superseded by the cult of Horus. The two were then combined as &quot;Ra-Horus of the Horizons&quot;.

==Mythology==

According to the creation story of the Heliopolitan priests, the world originally consisted of the primordial waters of precreation personified as Nun. From it arose a mound on the First Occasion. Upon the mound sat the self-begotten god Atum, who was equated with the sun god Ra. Atum evolved from Nun through self-creation. Atum either spat or masturbated, producing air personified as Shu and moisture personified as Tefnut. The siblings Shu and Tefnut mated to produce the earth personified as Geb and the nighttime sky personified as Nut.

Geb and Nut were the parents of Osiris and Isis and of Set and Nephthys, who became respective couples in turn. Osiris and Isis represent fertility and order, while Set and Nephthys represent chaos to balance out Osiris and Isis. Horus, the son of Osiris and Isis, is often included in this creation tradition. Due to the duality of Ancient Egyptian myths, this is only one of many creation stories. The Egyptians believed no specific myth was more correct than the other, rather that some combination of these myths was correct. This creation story, the Heliopolitan tradition, is one of physiological creation. The other major creation traditions are the Memphite Theology and Hermopolitian Ogdoad creation myth.

==Variant hieroglyphs for the Ennead==


A dual Ennead (&quot;&quot;) was written
R8A-R8A-R8A-R8A-R8A-R8A

==In popular culture==
In &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders&quot;, nine of Dio Brando&#x27;s minions have Stands named after the Ennead.

Most of the Ennead are portrayed in &quot;Gods of Egypt&quot; (2016 movie); the main focus of the movie is the conflict between the protagonist god Horus versus the antagonist god Set.

In the first episode of the 2022 Marvel Cinematic Universe television miniseries Moon Knight, Steven Grant points out a problem with some of the museum&#x27;s marketing material that seems to refer to the Ennead as a pantheon consisting of seven, rather than nine, gods. Yet in episode 3 they name Hathor as part of the Ennead, pointing out a deviation with the series&#x27; interpretation of the mythology.

In the BL manhwa ENNEAD, written and illustrated by Mojito, Set (using the name Seth) is the main character. It draws heavily upon classic Egyptian mythology and centers on the conflict between Horus and Seth.

The &quot;Infernal Relics&quot; expansion to the cooperative superhero card game Sentinels of the Multiverse introduced a group of supervillains collectively called the Ennead. Each of its members wield an ancient artifact that grant them the powers and appearance of a member of the mythological Ennead; in the game&#x27;s universe, most of ancient Egyptian religion originated from stories about the original wielders of these artifacts.

<doc id="97193" wikidata="Q4165437" url="?curid=97193" title="Wide-angle X-ray scattering">
<text>In X-ray crystallography, wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) or wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) is the analysis of Bragg peaks scattered to wide angles, which (by Bragg&#x27;s law) are caused by sub-nanometer-sized structures. It is an X-ray-diffraction method and commonly used to determine a range of information about crystalline materials. The term WAXS is commonly used in polymer sciences to differentiate it from SAXS but many scientists doing &quot;WAXS&quot; would describe the measurements as Bragg/X-ray/powder diffraction or crystallography. 

Wide-angle X-ray scattering is similar to small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) but the increasing angle between the sample and detector is probing smaller length scales. This requires samples to be more ordered/crystalline for information to be extracted. In a dedicated SAXS instrument the distance from sample to the detector is longer to increase angular resolution. Most diffractometers can be used to perform both WAXS and limited SAXS in a single run (small- and wide-angle scattering, SWAXS) by adding a beamstop/knife edge. 

==Applications==
The WAXS technique is used to determine the degree of crystallinity of polymer samples. It can also be used to determine the chemical composition or phase composition of a film, the texture of a film (preferred alignment of crystallites), the crystallite size and presence of film stress. As with other diffraction methods, the sample is scanned in a wide-angle X-ray goniometer, and the scattering intensity is plotted as a function of the 2θ angle. 

X-ray diffraction is a non destructive method of characterization of solid materials. When X-rays are directed at solids they scatter in predictable patterns based on the internal structure of the solid. A crystalline solid consists of regularly spaced atoms (electrons) that can be described by imaginary planes. The distance between these planes is called the d-spacing. 

The intensity of the d-space pattern is directly proportional to the number of electrons (atoms) in the imaginary planes. Every crystalline solid has a unique pattern of d-spacings (known as the powder pattern), which is a fingerprint for that solid. Solids with the same chemical composition but different phases can be identified by their pattern of d-spacings.

<text>Larry David Norman (April 8, 1947 – February 24, 2008) was an American musician, singer, songwriter, record label owner, and record producer. He is considered to be one of the pioneers of Christian rock music and released more than 100 albums.

==Early life==
Larry Norman was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, the oldest son of Joe Hendrex &quot;Joe Billy&quot; Norman (December 9, 1923 – April 28, 1999), and his wife, Margaret Evelyn &quot;Marge&quot; Stout (born in 1925 in Nebraska). Joe Norman had served as a sergeant in the US Army Air Corps during World War II and worked at the Southern Pacific Railroad while studying to become a teacher. After Norman&#x27;s birth, the family joined the Southern Baptist church. In 1950 the family moved to San Francisco, where they attended an African American Pentecostal church and then a Baptist church, where Norman became a Christian at the age of five. In 1959, Norman performed on the syndicated television show &quot;The Original Amateur Hour&quot;.

In 1960, Norman&#x27;s father began teaching in San Jose, California; the family lived in nearby Campbell. Norman graduated from Campbell High School in 1965 and won an academic scholarship to major in English at San José State University. After one semester, Norman &quot;flunked out of college and lost [his] scholarship.&quot;

Although Norman was able to play a variety of musical instruments, he never learned to read or write musical notation.

==Career==
===Early bands===
While still in high school, Norman formed a group called The Back Country Seven, which included his sister Nancy Jo and friend Gene Mason. After graduating, Norman continued performing locally.

In 1966 Norman opened a concert for People! at the Asilomar Conference Grounds in Pacific Grove, California. He later became the band&#x27;s principal songwriter, sharing lead vocals with his Back Country Seven bandmate Gene Mason. People! performed about 200 concerts a year, appearing with Van Morrison and Them, the Animals, the Dave Clark Five, Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders, the Doors, the Who, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Moby Grape, and San Jose bands Syndicate of Sound and Count Five. The band&#x27;s cover of the Zombies&#x27; &quot;I Love You&quot; became a hit single, selling over one million copies and charting strongly in several markets. Norman left People! just as Capitol released the band&#x27;s first album in mid 1968, but reunited with Mason for concerts in 1974 and 2006. According to rock historian Walter Rasmussen, Pete Townshend once said that The Who&#x27;s 1969 album &quot;Tommy&quot; was inspired by the rock opera &quot;Epic&quot; by People!; however, Townshend has since denied the connection.

===Hollywood street ministry===
Soon after Norman left People!, he had &quot;a powerful spiritual encounter that threw him into a frenzy of indecision about his life [and] for the first time in his life, he received what he understood to be the Holy Spirit&quot;.

In July 1968, following a job offer to write musicals for Capitol Records, Norman moved to Los Angeles where he &quot;spent time sharing the gospel on the streets&quot;. As he described in 2006: &quot;I walked up and down Hollywood Boulevard several times a day ... witnessing to businessmen and hippies, and to whomever the Spirit led me. I spent all of my Capitol Records&#x27; royalties starting a halfway house and buying clothes and food for new converts.&quot; He was initially associated with the First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, and its Salt Company coffee house outreach ministry, where he explored and pioneered the rock-gospel genre.

===Musical theatre===
In 1968 Norman wrote several songs for the rock musicals &quot;Alison&quot; and &quot;Birthday for Shakespeare&quot;, both of which were performed in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;NORMAN%20LARRY%20DAVID&amp;querytype=WriterID&amp;keyid=251231&amp;page=1&amp;blnWriter=True&amp;blnPublisher=True&amp;blnArtist=True&amp;affiliation=BMI&amp;cae=214063413 |title=Songwriter/Composer: Norman Larry David&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year, Norman and his friend Teddy Neeley auditioned for the Los Angeles production of the rock musical &quot;Hair&quot; and were offered the roles of George Berger and Claude Bukowski, respectively; Neeley accepted, but Norman rejected the role of George, despite his own financial struggles, because &quot;of its glorification of drugs and free sex as the answers to today&#x27;s problems&quot;. Also in 1969, Norman wrote a musical called &quot;Love on Haight Street&quot; and a rock opera called &quot;Lion&#x27;s Breath&quot;, which led Capitol to re-sign Norman to record an album, with the promise of complete creative control.

===Recording career===
In 1969, Capitol Records released Norman&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Upon This Rock&quot;, produced by Hal Yoergler, is now considered to be &quot;the first full-blown Christian rock album&quot;. Norman was denounced by various television evangelists, and Capitol deemed the album a commercial flop and dropped Norman from the label. However, his music gained a large following in the emerging countercultural movements. Sales of the album rose following its distribution in Christian bookstores.

By the early 1970s, Norman was performing frequently for large audiences, and appeared at several Christian music festivals, including Explo &#x27;72, a six-day Dallas event which has been called the &quot;Jesus Woodstock.&quot; Norman established a half-way house where he &quot;housed and fed various groups of people, supervised their Bible studies and drove them to church on Fridays and Sundays&quot;. He earned $80 per month from Capitol for polishing and refining songs for Capitol artists. In 1970, Norman began a record label, One Way Records. He released two of his own albums &quot;Street Level&quot; and &quot;Bootleg&quot; on the label as well as Randy Stonehill&#x27;s first album, &quot;Born Twice&quot;.

In 1971, Norman first visited England where he lived and worked for several years. He recorded two studio albums, &quot;Only Visiting This Planet&quot; and &quot;So Long Ago the Garden&quot;, in London&#x27;s AIR Studios. Released in 1972, &quot;Visiting&quot; &quot;was meant to reach the flower children disillusioned by the government and the church&quot; with its &quot;abrasive, urban reality of the gospel&quot;, and has often been ranked as Norman&#x27;s best album. The release of &quot;Garden&quot; in November 1973 was met with controversy in the Christian press, due to the album&#x27;s cover art and some songs in which Norman took the persona of a backslider.

In 1974, Norman founded Solid Rock Records to produce records for Christian artists &quot;who didn&#x27;t want to be consumed by the business of making vinyl pancakes but who wanted to make something &#x27;non-commercial&#x27; to the world&quot;. Norman produced music on the label for artists including Randy Stonehill, Mark Heard and Tom Howard. Norman also worked with several artists who were signed to other labels, including Malcolm and Alwyn, Bobby Emmons and the Crosstones, Lyrix, James Sundquist and David Edwards. Norman signed a deal with ABC Records to distribute Solid Rock&#x27;s releases, but was later moved to ABC subsidiary Word Records. In the same year, Norman founded the Christian artist booking agency Street Level Artists Agency.

&quot;In Another Land&quot;, the third album in Norman&#x27;s trilogy and the best-selling album of his career, was released in 1976 by Solid Rock and distributed through Word. Soon afterward, Norman recorded the blues-rock concept album &quot;Something New under the Son&quot;, but it would not be released until 1981. Following clashes with Word over &quot;Something New&quot; and several other projects, Norman started Phydeaux Records in 1980 to release his albums.

In 1978, Norman was injured during a plane landing at Los Angeles International Airport. Norman claimed to have suffered mild brain damage due to being hit by parts of the cabin&#x27;s roof, and that this damage left him unable to complete projects and focus artistically. William Ayers wrote in 1991: &quot;As family, friends and fans watched, his life spiraled downward. He was unable to record a bonafide album from the time of his airplane accident in 1978 until ... he attempted to release the badly produced &quot;Home at Last&quot; [recorded in 1986]. He never expected to be healed.&quot;

In September 1979, Norman performed his &quot;The Great American Novel&quot;, &quot;a Dylanesque protest song&quot;, for U.S. president Jimmy Carter and about 1,000 guests at the &quot;Old Fashioned Gospel Singin″&quot; concert held on the south lawn of the White House.

Following a prolonged dispute with Solid Rock artists Daniel Amos which ended in estrangement, Solid Rock&#x27;s business manager, Philip Mangano, and several Solid Rock musicians organized an intervention with Norman in June 1980, which led him to begin closing the company. Religious history professor Randall Balmer attributed the company&#x27;s demise to &quot;idealism, marital difficulties, and financial naivete—as well as changing musical tastes.&quot;

In late 1980, Norman moved to England and, with his father, founded Phydeaux Records, a company designed to compete with the bootleg market by selling rarities from Norman&#x27;s own archives. He signed a distribution deal with British label Chapel Lane and released several albums before returning to the United States in 1985. Norman then began work on an anthology project celebrating his career in Christian music, beginning with the album &quot;White Blossoms from Black Roots: The History and the Chronology: Volume One&quot;; however, the project collapsed when the head of the distribution company was arrested for check forgery and the company&#x27;s merchandise was seized by the FBI.

Norman signed to Benson Records in 1986 and recorded the album &quot;Home at Last&quot;, although the album was not released until 1989 due to legal problems. Despite extensive promotion, the album was negatively reviewed, and Norman himself later dismissed the album as &quot;just a collection of tapes I had&quot;, although he said separately that he was &quot;extremely happy&quot; with the level of support he&#x27;d received from Benson. In 1989, Norman received the Christian Artists&#x27; Society Lifetime Achievement Award.

While visiting another musician at the close of a February 1991 tour, Norman received prayer for his long-term health problems from a pastor of London&#x27;s Elim Way Fellowship. Norman maintained that through this prayer God repaired the damage to his brain and he was able to function again. That year, he collaborated with his brother Charles on the album &quot;Stranded in Babylon&quot;, hailed by both critics and fans as one of his best. They would reunite for the 2001 album &quot;Tourniquet&quot;.

Norman continued to perform and release albums throughout his later years in order to raise funds for medical expenses stemming from heart problems. He gave his last official concert on August 4, 2007, in New York City.

===Relationship with the church and Christian music industry===
Throughout his career, Norman had a contentious relationship with the wider Christian church and with the Christian music industry. He wrote in September 2007, &quot;I love God and I follow Jesus but I just don&#x27;t have much affinity for the organized folderol of the churches in the Western World.&quot; Norman&#x27;s music addressed a wide range of social issues, such as politics, free love, the occult, the passive commercialism of wartime journalists, and religious hypocrisy, that were outside the scope of his contemporaries. Defending the confrontational approach of his music, Norman said, &quot;My primary emphasis is not to entertain. But if your art is boring, people will reject your message as well as your art.&quot; In the 1980s, he complained that Christian music generally meant &quot;sloppy thinking, dishonest metaphors and bad poetry,&quot; and that he had &quot;never been able to get over the shock of how bad the lyrics are.&quot;

Norman disapproved of Christian musicians who were unwilling to play in secular venues or to &quot;preach&quot; between songs. He also criticized what he saw as the &quot;commercialization of Christian music in America&quot;, including the role of copyrights and licensing.

===Influence===

In 2008, Christian rock historian John J. Thompson wrote, &quot;It is certainly no overstatement to say that Larry Norman is to Christian music what John Lennon is to rock &amp; roll or Bob Dylan is to folk music.&quot; Thompson credited Norman for his impact on the genre as a musician, a producer, and a businessman.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Norman also influenced a number of emerging punk and alternative rock artists. According to documentarian Larry Di Sabatino, Larry Norman was &quot;an early influence&quot; on the post-punk band U2. When Bono met with a summit of Nashville Christian music artists in 2002 to garner support for an African aid campaign, he specifically asked to see Norman. Upon Larry Norman&#x27;s death, Bono sent flowers to his funeral with the note &quot;Eternal singer, still eternal, Bono.&quot;

According to Charles Normal, Larry Norman attended his &quot;first of many&quot; punk rock shows while touring London in 1977, seeing Richard Hell and the Voidoids, the Damned, and Dead Boys. Regarding the punk movement, Norman stated that while he initially disliked some of the lyrical content, he was generally supportive of it and its youthful energy, which he viewed as preferable to disco.

Norman subsequently introduced his younger brother, Charles, to the genre, including the music of the Sex Pistols. Within several years, Charles was the lead guitarist for the Bay Area hardcore punk band, Executioner. Larry paid for the recording of Executioner&#x27;s first EP in 1982, on the condition that they also record one of his songs. Larry Norman began to meet figures from the L.A. punk scene, and eventually recorded tracks with former Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones. Norman also released a live recording of a punk version of &quot;Why Should the Devil Have All the Good Music?&quot; 

Pixies frontman Black Francis described Larry Norman as having been his &quot;total idol&quot; as a teenager, whom he attempted to imitate. The band&#x27;s first demo, &quot;The Purple Tape&quot;, was to contain a cover of Norman&#x27;s song &quot;Watch What You&#x27;re Doing&quot;, but it was never released. A lyric from the song &quot;Levitate Me&quot; (&quot;Come on pilgrim, you know He loves you!&quot;) formed the basis for the title of Pixies&#x27; 1987 EP &quot;Come On Pilgrim&quot;. Black was eventually introduced to Norman by members of U2 during the Zoo TV tour. Black&#x27;s post-Pixies band, Frank Black and the Catholics, covered Larry Norman&#x27;s song &quot;Six Sixty Six&quot;. Norman and Black performed a duet of &quot;Watch What You&#x27;re Doing&quot; at Norman&#x27;s &quot;farewell&quot; concert, and the two were reportedly working on an album together at the time of his death, along with Isaac Brock of Modest Mouse.

Steve Camp, Carolyn Arends, Bob Hartman, TobyMac, Mark Salomon, Martyn Joseph, and Steve Scott have credited Norman as influences. Overall over 300 artists have covered songs by Norman.

==Family==
Norman married actress and model Pamela Fay Ahlquist in December 1971. They separated in 1978 and divorced in September 1980.

In April 1982, Norman married Sarah Mae Finch. However another source indicates this was in April 1984. Finch had previously been married to Randy Stonehill from 1975 to 1980. The two had first met at a religious retreat in 1969. Their only child, Michael David Fariah Finch Norman, was born in August 1985. The couple divorced in 1995.

In 2008, &quot;World&quot; magazine speculated Norman fathered a son with an Australian woman during a 1988 tour, although definitive proof was never presented.

==Coronary issues and death==
In February 1992, Norman suffered a nine-hour heart attack that resulted in permanent heart damage, leading to frequent hospitalizations in the years that followed. By early 1995, Norman had been hospitalized thirteen times and had a defibrillator implant, which enabled him to perform occasional small concerts.

After a lengthy illness, Norman died on February 24, 2008, at the age of 60 at his home in Salem, Oregon. The previous day he had posted on his website:

I feel like a prize in a box of Cracker Jacks with God&#x27;s hand reaching down to pick me up. I have been under medical care for months. My wounds are getting bigger. I have trouble breathing. I am ready to fly home. I won&#x27;t be here much longer. I can&#x27;t do anything about it. My heart is too weak. I want to say goodbye to everyone ... I want to say I love you. I&#x27;d like to push back the darkness with my bravest effort ... Goodbye, farewell, we will meet again.

Following a public memorial on March 1 at the Church on the Hill in Turner, Oregon, Norman was buried in Salem&#x27;s City View Cemetery. His tombstone reads: &quot;Larry Norman / Evangelist Without Portfolio / 1947–2008 / Bloodstained Israelite&quot;.

==&quot;Fallen Angel&quot; documentary==
&quot;Fallen Angel: The Outlaw Larry Norman: A Bible Story&quot; is a controversial 2008 documentary on Norman&#x27;s life by filmmaker David Di Sabatino. &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; includes interviews with several people who had worked with or been close to Norman thirty years earlier, including his first wife and Randy Stonehill, who recorded the film&#x27;s official soundtrack, &quot;Paradise Sky&quot;.

Norman and his second wife had refused to participate in or cooperate with the project. A cease and desist notice initiated by Norman&#x27;s family temporarily prevented the film&#x27;s public screening, and prompted Di Sabatino to file his own lawsuit against Solid Rock in March 2009. Four months later, the case was settled out of court, allowing the film to be shown. While interviewing Stonehill, &quot;Cross Rhythms&quot;″ Mike Rimmer said the film portrayed Norman as &quot;Machiavellian, particularly in his dealings with his artists.&quot;

Norman&#x27;s Solid Rock Records was said to have ended when, &quot;Things finally fell apart in 1979, after it was discovered Larry was cheating on his wife – and having an affair with Randy&#x27;s wife&quot;, a claim Norman&#x27;s brother denies. Gregory Alan Thornbury&#x27;s biography of Norman proposes an alternate date and reason for Solid Rock Records being wound up and the artists released from their contracts. Word Records signalled they planned to end their relationship with Solid Rock due to poor sales performances of a few of the albums and the infrequent nature of releases being delivered by the label and this news led to a breakdown in the working and personal relationship between Larry Norman and Philip Mangano in May 1980. Some discussions had already begun about certain artists being released from their contracts prior to the meeting on June 17, 1980, which was called to &quot;clear up the relationship between Solid Rock and Street Level Artists Agency, and to deal with Daniel Amos&#x27; request to have all their contracts back from Solid Rock — management, recording, tapes, publishing, and so on&quot; and which ended two hours later in stalemate and acrimony rather than resolution.
