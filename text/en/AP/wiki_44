<text>FreeDOS (formerly PD-DOS) is a free software operating system for IBM PC compatible computers. It intends to provide a complete MS-DOS-compatible environment for running legacy software and supporting embedded systems. FreeDOS can be booted from a floppy disk or USB flash drive and is designed to run well under virtualization or x86 emulation.

The FreeDOS project began under Jim Hall in 1994, and the first stable version was released in 2006. Unlike most versions of MS-DOS, FreeDOS is composed of free software, licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License. However, other packages that form part of the FreeDOS project include non-GPL software considered worthy of preservation, such as 4DOS, which is distributed under a modified MIT License.

== Distribution ==
FreeDOS 1.1, released on 2 January 2012, is available for download as a CD-ROM image: a limited install disc that only contains the kernel and basic applications, and a full disc that contains many more applications (games, networking, development, etc.), not available but with a newer, fuller 1.2. The legacy version 1.0 (2006) consisted of two CDs, one of which was an 8 MB install CD targeted at regular users and the other which was a larger 49 MB live CD that also held the source code of the project.

=== Commercial uses ===
FreeDOS is used by several companies:
* Dell preloaded FreeDOS with its n-series desktops to reduce their cost. The firm has been criticized for making these machines no cheaper, and harder to buy, than identical systems with Windows.
* Hewlett-Packard provided FreeDOS as an option in its HP Compaq dc5750 Small Form Factor PC, &quot;Mini 5101&quot; netbooks and &quot;Probook&quot; laptops. FreeDOS is also used as bootable media for updating the BIOS firmware in HP systems.
* FreeDOS is included by Steve Gibson&#x27;s hard drive maintenance and recovery program, SpinRite.
* Intel&#x27;s Solid-State Drive Firmware Update Tool loaded the FreeDOS kernel.
* Many motherboard vendors recommend a bootable FreeDOS for running low level BIOS and firmware updates.

=== Non-commercial uses ===
FreeDOS is also used in multiple independent projects:
* FED-UP is the Floppy Enhanced DivX Universal Player.
* FUZOMA is a FreeDOS-based distribution that can boot from a floppy disk and converts older computers into educational tools for children.
* XFDOS is a FreeDOS-based distribution with a graphical user interface, porting Nano-X and FLTK.
== Development and version history ==

The FreeDOS project began on 29 June 1994, after Microsoft announced it would no longer sell or support MS-DOS. Jim Hall, who at the time was a student, posted a manifesto proposing the development of PD-DOS, a public domain version of DOS. Within a few weeks, other programmers including Pat Villani and Tim Norman joined the project. Between them, a kernel (by Villani), the COMMAND.COM command line interpreter (by Villani and Norman), and core utilities (by Hall) were created by pooling code they had written or found available. For some time, the project was maintained by Morgan &quot;Hannibal&quot; Toal. There have been many official pre-release distributions of FreeDOS before the final FreeDOS 1.0 distribution. GNU/DOS, an unofficial distribution of FreeDOS, was discontinued after version 1.0 was released.Blinky the Fish is the mascot of FreeDOS. He was designed by Bas Snabilie.

== Compatibility ==
=== Hardware ===
FreeDOS requires a PC/XT machine with at least 640 kB of memory. Programs not bundled with FreeDOS often require additional system resources.

=== MS-DOS and Win32 console ===
FreeDOS is mostly compatible with MS-DOS. It supports COM executables, standard DOS executables and Borland&#x27;s 16-bit DPMI executables. It is also possible to run 32-bit DPMI executables using DOS extenders. The operating system has several improvements relative to MS-DOS, mostly involving support for newer standards and technologies that did not exist when Microsoft ended support for MS-DOS, such as internationalization, or the Advanced Power Management TSRs. Furthermore, with the use of HX DOS Extender, many Windows Console applications function properly in FreeDOS, as do some rare GUI programs, like QEMM and Bochs.

=== DOS-based Windows ===
FreeDOS is able to run Microsoft Windows 1.0 and 2.0 releases. Windows 3.x releases, which had support for i386 processors, cannot fully be run in 386 Enhanced Mode, except partially in the experimental FreeDOS kernel 2037.

Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows Me use a stripped-down version of MS-DOS. FreeDOS cannot be used as a replacement because the undocumented interfaces between MS-DOS 7.0–8.0 and Windows &quot;4.xx&quot; are not emulated by FreeDOS; however, it can be installed and used beside these systems using a boot manager program, such as codice_1 or codice_2 included with FreeDOS.

=== Windows NT and ReactOS ===
Windows NT-based operating systems, including Windows 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10 and 11 for desktops, and Windows Server 2003, 2008 and 2008 R2 for servers, do not make use of MS-DOS as a core component of the system. These systems can make use of the FAT file systems which are used by MS-DOS and earlier versions of Windows; however, they typically use the NTFS (New Technology File System) by default for security and other reasons. FreeDOS can co-exist on these systems on a separate partition or on the same partition on FAT systems. The FreeDOS kernel can be booted by adding it to the Windows 2000 or XP&#x27;s NT Boot Loader configuration file, boot.ini, or the freeldr.ini equivalent for ReactOS.

=== Virtualization ===
FreeDOS is designed to work well with virtualization software such as VirtualBox and VMware. The installation process is identical to real hardware. It is also possible to install FreeDOS on DOSBox and its derivatives. By doing so, it provides additional functionality not present in the emulator.

=== File systems ===

FAT32 is fully supported and is the preferred format for the boot drive. Depending on the BIOS used, up to four Logical Block Addressing (LBA) hard disks of up to 128 GB, or 2 TB, in size are supported. There has been little testing with large disks, and some BIOSes support LBA, but produce errors on disks larger than 32 GB; a driver such as OnTrack or EZ-Drive resolves this problem. FreeDOS can also be used with a driver called codice_3 to enable support for Windows 95-style long file names, but most pre-Windows 95 programs do not support long file names, even with a driver loaded. There is no planned support for NTFS, ext2 or exFAT, but there are several external third-party drivers available for that purpose. To access ext2 file systems, codice_4, a counterpart to Mtools, can sometimes be used to copy data to and from ext2 file system drives.

<doc id="99208" wikidata="Q5709303" url="?curid=99208" title="Helmet Law Defense League">
<text>The Helmet Law Defense League (HLDL) is a group founded in 1993 that opposes the laws in states which mandate motorcycle helmets. The group contends that mandatory motorcycle helmet laws enacted at the state, county, and municipal levels of government against consumers and users are unconstitutional due to vagueness, and this often results in arbitrary and &quot;ad hoc&quot; enforcement in those states which have enacted mandatory helmet laws.

The HLDL claims that the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) enacted by the US Congress at the United States Federal level under USC Title 49 Chapter 301 apply to manufacturers, importers, distributors, and retailers, but proscribe no regulation to consumers and motorists, and in the opinion of the HLDL&#x27;s supporters, no enforcement guidelines for law enforcement agencies at the state level or below. Based on these opinions, the HLDL claims that in states which have embedded statutory reference to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, those standards are not applicable to consumers and those motorists who choose to use, or to not use, motorcycle helmets. Therefore, the HLDL says, enforcement actions are arbitrary and ad hoc.

The HLDL researches, analyzes, and publishes many different legal arguments founded on Constitutional law, statutory law, and common law.

Upon the (cancer) death of Richard &quot;Quig&quot; Quigley, biker rights advocate, on 15 September 2007, the HLDL internet site, which was constantly updated by Quigley, was frozen in time. Surviving members of the Helmet Law Defense League continue to be active in analyzing legal arguments, and contesting helmet laws in both pro se and attorney-assisted court cases. Publication of Helmet Law Defense League articles and updates, post-2007, has migrated to a think tank within the national motorcyclist rights collective known as Bikers of Lesser Tolerance (B.O.L.T.), which Richard Quigley was a member.

<text>The National Print Museum in Beggar&#x27;s Bush, Dublin, Ireland, collects, and exhibits a representative selection of printing equipment, and samples of print, and fosters associated skills of the printing craft in Ireland. It was opened in 1996.

==Mission and accreditation==
The mission of the museum is to collect, document, preserve, exhibit, interpret and make accessible the material evidence of printing craft, and fosters associated skills of the craft in Ireland. It aims to ensure that printers, historians, students and the general public can explore how printing developed and brought information, in all its forms, to the world.

The museum is fully accredited under The Heritage Council’s Museum Standards Programme for Ireland.

==Collection and exhibits==

The museum holds over 10,000 items including printing machinery, printing blocks, metal and wooden moveable type, ephemera, photographs, books, pamphlets and periodicals.

On exhibit is a representative display of the equipment and artefacts of the rich centuries-old printing heritage, including a replica Gutenberg press (on loan from The Tudors TV series). There was also an original 1916 Proclamation along with a machine (Wharfedale) similar to the one it was printed on.

==Facilities==
The museum has two floors, with a shop, a cafe at the rear, and a children&#x27;s corner upstairs.

==Activities==
The National Print Museum&#x27;s activities include guided tours, exhibitions, workshops, outreach, lectures and demonstration days. Workshops focus on print-related crafts such as calligraphy, actual printmaking, and batik.

<doc id="99211" wikidata="Q210953" url="?curid=99211" title="Solar calendar">
<text>A solar calendar is a calendar whose dates indicate the season or almost equivalently the apparent position of the Sun relative to the stars. The Gregorian calendar, widely accepted as a standard in the world, is an example of a solar calendar.
The main other types of calendar are lunar calendar and lunisolar calendar, whose months correspond to cycles of Moon phases. The months of the Gregorian calendar do not correspond to cycles of the Moon phase.

The Egyptians appear to have been the first to develop a solar calendar, using as a fixed point the annual sunrise reappearance of the Dog Star—Sirius, or Sothis—in the eastern sky, which coincided with the annual flooding of the Nile River. They constructed a calendar of 365 days, consisting of 12 months of 30 days each, with 5 days added at the year’s end. The Egyptians’ failure to account for the extra fraction of a day, however, caused their calendar to drift gradually into error.

==Examples==
The oldest solar calendars include the Julian calendar and the Coptic calendar. 
They both have a year of 365 days, which is extended to 366 once every four years, without exception, so have a mean year of 365.25 days.
As solar calendars became more accurate, they evolved into two types.
===Tropical solar calendars===

If the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun is reckoned with respect to the Equinox, the point at which the orbit crosses the celestial equator, then its dates accurately indicate the seasons, that is, they are synchronized with the declination of the Sun. Such a calendar is called a tropical solar calendar ..

The duration of the &quot;mean&quot; calendar year of such a calendar approximates some form of the tropical year, usually either the mean tropical year or the vernal equinox year.

The following are tropical solar calendars:
*Ancient Armenian calendar
*Bengali calendar (National and official calendar in Bangladesh)
*Gregorian calendar
*Iranian calendar (Jalāli calendar)
**Tabarian calendar (Tabarian calendar)
*Indian national calendar (Saka calendar)
*French Republican calendar

Every one of these calendars has a year of 365 days, which is occasionally extended by adding an extra day to form a leap year, a method called &quot;intercalation&quot;, the inserted day being &quot;intercalary&quot;.

The Baháʼí calendar, another example of a solar calendar, always begins the year on the vernal equinox and sets its intercalary days so that the following year also begins on the vernal equinox. The moment of the vernal equinox in the northern hemisphere is determined using the location of Tehran &quot;by means of astronomical computations from reliable sources&quot;.

===Sidereal solar calendars===

If the position of the Earth (see above) is reckoned with respect to the fixed stars, then the dates indicate the zodiacal constellation near which the Sun can be found. A calendar of this type is called a sidereal solar calendar.

The mean calendar year of such a calendar approximates the sidereal year.

Leaping from one lunation to another, but one Sidereal year is the period between two occurrences of the sun, as measured by the stars&#x27; solar calendar, which is derived from the Earth&#x27;s orbit around the sun every 28 years.

Indian calendars like the Hindu calendar, Tamil calendar, Bengali calendar (revised) and Malayalam calendar are sidereal solar calendars. The Thai solar calendar when based on the Hindu solar calendar was also a sidereal calendar. They are calculated on the basis of the apparent motion of the Sun through the twelve zodiacal signs rather than the tropical movement of the Earth.

==Non-solar calendars==

The Islamic calendar is a purely lunar calendar and has a year, whose start drifts through the seasons and so is not a solar calendar.
The Maya Tzolkin calendar, which follows a 260-day cycle, has no year, therefore it is not a solar calendar.
Also, any calendar synchronized only to the synodic period of Venus would not be solar.

==Lunisolar calendars==

Lunisolar calendars may be regarded as solar calendars, although their dates additionally indicate the moon phase. Typical lunisolar calendars have years marked with a whole number of lunar months, so they can not indicate the position of Earth relative to the Sun with the same accuracy as a purely solar calendar.

<text>A supervillain, supervillainess or supercriminal is a variant of the villainous stock character. It is sometimes found in comic books and may possess superhuman abilities. A supervillain is the antithesis of a superhero.

==Description==
Supervillains are often used as foils to present a daunting challenge to a superhero. In instances where the supervillain does not have superhuman, mystical, or alien powers, the supervillain may possess a genius intellect or a skill set that allows them to draft complex schemes or commit crimes in a way normal humans cannot. Other traits may include and possession of considerable resources to further their aims. Many supervillains share some typical characteristics of real-world dictators, gangsters, mad scientists, trophy hunters, corrupt businesspeople, serial killers, and terrorists, often having an aspiration of world domination.

==Notable supervillains==
The Joker, Lex Luthor, Doctor Doom, Magneto, Brainiac, Deathstroke, the Green Goblin, Loki, the Reverse-Flash, Black Manta, Ultron, Thanos, and Darkseid are some notable male comic book supervillains that have been adapted in film and television. Some notable female supervillains are Catwoman, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Mystique, Hela, Viper, and the Cheetah.

Just like superheroes, supervillains are sometimes members of groups, such as the Injustice League, the Sinister Six, the Legion of Doom, the Brotherhood of Mutants, the Suicide Squad, and the Masters of Evil.

In the documentary &quot;A Study in Sherlock&quot;, writers Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss said they regarded Professor James Moriarty as a supervillain because he possesses genius-level intelligence and powers of observation and deduction, setting him above ordinary people to the point where only he can pose a credible threat to Sherlock Holmes.

Fu Manchu is an archetypal evil criminal genius and mad scientist created by English author Sax Rohmer in 1913. The Fu Manchu moustache became integral to stereotypical cinematic and television depictions of Chinese villains. Between 1965 and 1969 Christopher Lee played Fu Manchu five times in film, and in 1973 the character first appeared in Marvel Comics.

The James Bond arch-villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld (whose scenes often show him sitting on an armchair stroking his cat, his face unseen) has influenced supervillain tropes in popular cinema, including parodies like Dr. Claw and M.A.D. Cat from the &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; animated series, Dr. Evil and Mr. Bigglesworth from the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film series, or Dr. Blowhole from the animated TV series &quot;The Penguins of Madagascar&quot;.

The overarching villain of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Emperor Palpatine, leads the tyrannical Galactic Empire, and was inspired by real-world tyrannical leaders.

<text>Ernst Stavro Blofeld is a fictional supervillain in the &quot;James Bond&quot; series of novels and films, created by Ian Fleming. A criminal mastermind with aspirations of world domination, he is the archenemy of British MI6 agent James Bond. Blofeld is head of the global criminal organisation SPECTRE and is commonly referred to by the codename Number 1 within this organisation. The character was originally written by Fleming as a physically massive and powerfully built man, standing around 6&#x27; 3&quot; (1.90 m) and weighing 20 st (280 lbs, 127 kg), who had become flabby with a huge belly.

The most recurring antagonist in the franchise, Blofeld appears or is heard in three novels: &quot;Thunderball&quot;, &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;; and &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;; as well as eight films from Eon Productions: &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (1963), &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1965), &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967), &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1969), &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971), possibly &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981; the pre-title sequence of which shows an unnamed character resembling Blofeld fall to his death), &quot;Spectre&quot; (2015) and &quot;No Time to Die&quot; (2021). The latter two films are set in a rebooted continuity, which started with &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006). Blofeld also appears in &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (1983), a remake of &quot;Thunderball&quot; that was not produced by Eon.

Blofeld has been played on-screen by Donald Pleasence, Telly Savalas, Charles Gray, Max von Sydow and Christoph Waltz, among others. It was initially a convention of the films not to show Blofeld&#x27;s face, only a close-up of his hands stroking his white, blue-eyed Persian cat. His face is revealed in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; when he introduces himself to Bond for the first time in person.

Many of Blofeld&#x27;s characteristics have become tropes in popular fiction, representing the stock character of the criminal mastermind, with the stroking of his white cat often retained as a parodic allusion to Blofeld&#x27;s character. This can be seen parodied in the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film series with the character of Dr. Evil and his cat Mr. Bigglesworth, or in the cartoons &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;, with the character of Dr. Claw and his pet M.A.D. Cat, and &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;, with the character of Baron Silas Greenback.

== Character ==
Ian Fleming includes information about Blofeld&#x27;s background in his novel &quot;Thunderball&quot;. According to the novel, Blofeld was born on 28 May 1908 (which is also Fleming&#x27;s birthdate) in Gdingen, Imperial Germany (now Gdynia, Poland); his father Ernst George Blofeld was Polish of German descent, and his mother Maria Stavro Michelopoulos was Greek, hence his Greek middle name Stavro. After World War I, Blofeld became a Polish national. As a young man, he was well-versed in the social science disciplines, but also in the natural science and technology disciplines. He first graduated from the University of Warsaw with a degree in Political History and Economics, and then from the Warsaw University of Technology with a degree in Engineering and Radionics. He was then hired by the Polish Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs and appointed to a sensitive communication position, which he used for buying and selling stocks at the Warsaw Stock Exchange.

Foreseeing World War II, Blofeld made copies of top-secret wires and sold them for cash to Nazi Germany. Before the German invasion of Poland in 1939, he destroyed all records of his existence, then moved first to Sweden, then to Turkey, where he worked for Turkish Radio and began to set up his own private intelligence organisation. During the war, he sold information to both sides. After the defeat of Erwin Rommel, he decided to back the Allied war effort, and was awarded numerous medals by the Allied powers after the war&#x27;s end. Blofeld then moved temporarily to South America before founding SPECTRE.

In the John Gardner novel &quot;For Special Services&quot;, Blofeld is depicted as having had a daughter, Nena, with a French prostitute.

Although Fleming himself never confirmed it, it is generally thought that the character of Blofeld was based on real-life Greek arms dealer Basil Zaharoff. It is commonly believed that the name Blofeld was inspired by the English cricket commentator Henry Blofeld&#x27;s father, Thomas Blofeld, with whom Fleming went to school. Henry Blofeld offered on the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;Just a Minute&quot; that &quot;Ian took my father&#x27;s name as the name of the baddie.&quot;

== In novels ==
Blofeld has three appearances in Ian Fleming&#x27;s novels. He first appears in a minor role as the leader of SPECTRE in the 1961 novel &quot;Thunderball&quot;. The plot that he formulates is carried out by his second-in-command Emilio Largo. Blofeld is described physically as a massive man, weighing roughly 20 st (280 lbs, 127 kg), who had previously been a champion amateur weightlifter in his youth before becoming obese in middle age; he has black crew-cut hair, black eyes (similar to those of Benito Mussolini), heavy eyelashes, a thin mouth, and long pointed hands and feet. He has violet-scented breath from chewing flavored cachous (breath mints), a habit he adopts whenever he must deliver bad news. A meticulous planner of formidable intellect, he seems to be without conscience but not necessarily insane, and is motivated solely by financial gain. Blofeld&#x27;s lifestyle is described in one chapter in &quot;Thunderball&quot;: &quot;For the rest, he didn&#x27;t smoke or drink and he had never been known to sleep with a member of either sex. He didn&#x27;t even eat very much.&quot;

The novel &quot;Thunderball&quot; indicates that Blofeld wants to be a man of honour, or at least pose as one. During a meeting of SPECTRE agents, he refers to the kidnapping of a teenage girl, who was to be returned unharmed once her father paid the ransom. However, he refunded half the money after learning that she had been raped by her abductor, and he kills the agent responsible for this infraction by electrocuting him in his chair. This is the third instance in which Blofeld kills an operative for a breach of discipline; he had earlier shot one through the heart with a needle fired from a compressed-air gun, and strangled another with a garrote. In the movie &quot;Thunderball&quot;, Blofeld kills an agent for embezzlement rather than rape.

Blofeld is absent from the next novel, &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, though its events take place while Bond is battling SPECTRE in North America. In &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1963), Bond learns that Blofeld has altered his appearance radicallyhe is now tall and thin, having reduced his weight to ; sports long silver hair, a syphilitic infection on his nose, and no earlobes; and he wears dark green tinted contact lenses to hide his distinctive eyes. Perhaps less calculating than previously, he is notably saddled with the exploitable weakness of snobbery about his assumed nobility, indicating that he is losing his sanity. He is hiding in Switzerland in the guise of the Comte Balthazar de Bleuville and Bond defeats his vindictive plans to destroy Britain&#x27;s agricultural economy (implied to be carried out on behalf of the Soviet Union). In the final sequence of the novel, Blofeld gets revenge by murdering Bond&#x27;s new wife, Tracy.

In &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, published in 1964, Blofeld returns and Bond finds him hiding in Japan under the alias Dr. Guntram Shatterhand. He has once again changed his appearance. He has put on some muscle and has a gold-capped tooth, a fully healed nose, and a drooping grey mustache. Bond describes Blofeld on their confrontation as being &quot;a big man, perhaps six foot three (190 cm), and powerfully built.&quot; It is indicated that Blofeld has by now gone completely insane, as he all but admits himself when Bond levels the accusation. Bond strangles him to death in a fit of rage at the end of the novel (something that he had done only once before, to Auric Goldfinger).

In both &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; and &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, Blofeld is aided in his schemes by Irma Bunt, who is clearly his lover in the latter, and posing as Shatterhand&#x27;s wife. Bond incapacitates her in their Japanese castle base before it blows up, killing her.

The final mention of Blofeld is in the beginning of the next novel, &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, published in 1965.

== In films ==
Blofeld&#x27;s depiction in film influenced with great effect the depiction of supervillains and (together with that of Don Vito Corleone in &quot;The Godfather&quot;) that of Mafia bosses both in films and printed media, as, since his first appearance on the big screen in 1963, he established some &quot;standards&quot; imitated for decades, such as mysterious identities, being portrayed stroking a pet and with the face unseen by the spectator or the viewpoint character, and the concept of spectacularly executing underlings who fail to defeat the main protagonist.

=== Original timeline ===
In the film series, Blofeld first appears in &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (credited as &quot;Ernst Blofeld&quot;, though the name is never heard), then in &quot;Thunderball&quot; (uncredited). In these two appearances, his name is never spoken, his face is not seen, and only his lower body is visible as he strokes his trademark white cat.

Originally, &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; was to include the twist that Blofeld was Auric Goldfinger&#x27;s twin brother, and would be portrayed by Gert Fröbe. However, this plotline was scrapped when it was delayed in favor of &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;. Czech actor Jan Werich was originally cast by producer Harry Saltzman to play Blofeld in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;. Upon his arrival at the Pinewood set, both producer Albert R. Broccoli and director Lewis Gilbert felt that he was a bad choice, resembling a &quot;poor, benevolent Santa Claus.&quot; Nonetheless, in an attempt to make the casting work, Gilbert continued filming. After five days, both Gilbert and Broccoli determined that Werich was not menacing enough, and recast Donald Pleasence in the role – the official excuse being that Werich was ill.

In the third, fourth, and fifth appearances&quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; and &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;he is the primary antagonist, meeting Bond face-to-face. In the film version of &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, he is not Tracy Bond&#x27;s (Diana Rigg) actual killer—rather, he plots to have Tracy killed. He drives the car from which Irma Bunt (Ilse Steppat) fires the fatal shots at Tracy, minutes after she had married Bond. During the opening sequence of &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;, Bond searches relentlessly for Blofeld and finds him overseeing the transformation of a henchman into a decoy duplicate, using plastic surgery. Bond drowns the decoy in a mud bath and kills Blofeld by shoving him into a volcanic pool, saying &quot;Welcome to Hell, Blofeld.&quot; After the credits, M tells Bond that now that Blofeld is dead, finished, he expects Bond to engage in &quot;a little plain, solid work.&quot; Of course, the man Bond killed turns out to be a duplicate. Bond would meet Blofeld again, along with another decoy, later in the film before eliminating the second decoy, and crashing Blofeld&#x27;s bathosub into the control room of an exploding oil rig, his fate left ambiguous.

In a sixth appearancein the pre-credit sequence of &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;he is an anonymous, bald, villain who uses a wheelchair and is trying to kill Bond once again. Due to the then-ongoing legal dispute between Kevin McClory and Eon Productions/United Artists over the &quot;Thunderball&quot; copyrights, Blofeld remained unnamed. The only clues to his identity are the trademark white cat, similar clothes to his previous onscreen appearances, the dialogue indicating he and Bond have met before, and the fact that the scene begins with Bond paying his respects at Tracy&#x27;s grave, often considered by the producers as a means of providing an &quot;immediate continuity link&quot; in the event of a new actor taking the part of Bond, as was almost the case before Roger Moore signed on again as Bond).

Blofeld&#x27;s appearance changes according to the personifying actor and the production. He has a full head of black hair in &quot;From Russia With Love&quot; and &quot;Thunderball&quot;; a bald head and a facial dueling scar in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;; a bald head with no scar or earlobes in &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;; and silver-grey hair in &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;. This metamorphosing matches Fleming&#x27;s literary portrayal of a master criminal who will go to great lengths to preserve his anonymity, including the use of plastic surgery. He often wears a jacket without lapels, based loosely either on the Nehru jacket or on the Mao suit, a feature which is used in spoofs like the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; series, though in his early two appearances on film he wears a black business suit.

=== Rebooted continuity ===
By November 2013, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and the McClory estate had formally settled the issue with Danjaq and MGM and acquired the full copyright to the characters and concepts of Blofeld and SPECTRE. Blofeld consequently reappeared in &quot;Spectre&quot;, played by Christoph Waltz, and with a new background. In this continuity, he was born Franz Oberhauser, the son of Hannes Oberhauser (a character from the original short story &quot;Octopussy&quot;), James Bond&#x27;s (Daniel Craig) legal guardian after being orphaned at the age of 11, making him and Bond adoptive brothers. As a young man, he resented Bond for being his father&#x27;s favorite, leading him to murder his father, stage his own death, and take on the alias of &quot;Ernst Stavro Blofeld&quot;, derived from his mother&#x27;s maiden name. Over time, he assembled a global criminal organisation known as Spectre. Additionally, it is revealed that the villains of the previous Craig films – Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), Mr. White (Jesper Christensen), Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), and Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) – were all really working for Spectre.

Bond encounters Blofeld while investigating a worldwide terrorist network, later revealed to be Spectre. Bond discovers that Blofeld is trying to take control of Nine Eyes, a global surveillance program, with help from treasonous Joint Intelligence Service agent Max Denbigh (Andrew Scott), and staging terrorist attacks in order to justify the program&#x27;s existence. Bond and Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux), Mr. White&#x27;s daughter, confront Blofeld at his hideout in the Sahara, where he gloats about being indirectly responsible for several tragedies in Bond&#x27;s life, including the deaths of his lover Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) and the previous M (Judi Dench). He then tortures his former foster brother by strapping him to a mechanical chair with surgical drills programmed to penetrate different areas of Bond&#x27;s brain. At the last second, however, Bond destroys the chair with an exploding watch given to him by Q (Ben Whishaw); the explosion destroys Blofeld&#x27;s right eye and leaves him with a vertical scar running down the wounded socket. Nevertheless, Blofeld manages to escape. Bond ultimately foils Blofeld&#x27;s plans and has the opportunity to kill him, but decides to spare his life, and Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), the current M, takes Blofeld into custody.

Blofeld, again portrayed by Waltz, appears in the 2021 Bond film &quot;No Time to Die&quot;. He has been held in solitary confinement at Belmarsh prison for five years since his capture, but has been covertly running Spectre while feigning insanity. Blofeld has operatives steal the &quot;Heracles&quot; bioweapon and lure Bond to a meeting of high-ranking Spectre agents in the hopes of infecting and killing him.

However, Blofeld&#x27;s plan is sabotaged by bioterrorist Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek), whose entire family was murdered by Mr. White on orders from Blofeld. Safin has the bioweapon altered by corrupt MI6 scientist Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik) so that it wipes out all the Spectre agents instead of Bond. Safin then coerces Swann to infect Blofeld with a strain of Heracles targeting his DNA. While attending Bond&#x27;s interrogation of Blofeld, Swann unknowingly passes the bioweapon onto him before abandoning Safin&#x27;s plan. Blofeld reveals he manipulated Bond into believing Swann had betrayed him five years earlier, resulting in Bond ending their relationship. Enraged, Bond chokes Blofeld, unwittingly infecting him and killing him within seconds.

This incarnation wears a jacket without lapels and has a full head of hair, reminiscent of the Donald Pleasence, Charles Gray, and Telly Savalas versions of the character, respectively. His disfigurement later on the film echoes the scar and blind eye of Pleasence&#x27;s version. He is also briefly shown with a white Persian cat, strikingly similar to the one from the Sean Connery era films.

=== Table of film appearances ===
== Comic books ==
In the James Bond comic books by Dynamite Entertainment, Blofeld appears as the main antagonist in the &quot;Agent of SPECTRE&quot; arc, which ran between March and July 2021. As in the original Ian Fleming novels, he is the son of a Polish father and a Greek mother; his mother belonged to a family of Greek ship-owners, with Blofeld inheriting a private fleet from her, which he manages to build up into a global shipping empire. His base of operations is the (fictional) Greek island of &quot;Meraki&quot;. Behind his veneer of respectability as a shipping billionaire, Blofeld is the leader of the resuscitated &quot;SPECTRE&quot; global criminal organisation, which had been thought dismantled since the end of the Cold War.

== Video games ==
Blofeld appears in the end of the 2004 video game &quot;&quot;, with the likeness of Donald Pleasence, voiced by Gideon Emery. Despite the character being clearly him, as chief of an anonymous but powerful crime syndicate, he is not named because of the then-ongoing copyright controversy that also prevented the open usage of the character in the Moore era films.

Blofeld is a playable multiplayer character in the 2010 video game &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; for the Wii, with the likeness of Charles Gray.

Blofeld is one of the main characters in the 2012 Craig-era video game &quot;007 Legends&quot;, featured in the mission based on &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (set between &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; and &quot;Skyfall&quot;), in which the character is an amalgamation of the first three actors appearing in the official film series. Throughout the game, he is voiced by Glenn Wrage. &quot;Legends&quot;, released prior to Blofeld&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Spectre&quot;, portrays a feud with 007 that is not related to the film, thus rendering the video game non-canonical to the cinematic timeline.

== Homages ==
Some of Blofeld&#x27;s characteristics have become supervillain tropes in popular fiction and media, including the parodies Dr. Claw (and his pet cat, M.A.D. Cat) from the &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; animated series (1983–1986), Team Rocket leader Giovanni and his Persian from the &quot;Pokémon&quot; television series, and Dr. Evil (and his cat Mr. Bigglesworth) from the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film series (1997–2002). The 1999 &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; episode &quot;Cat Man Do&quot; also features a supervillain with a cat, though it is the feline that turns out to be the criminal mastermind. In &quot;The Penguins of Madagascar&quot;, the recurring villain Dr. Blowhole is a parody and homage to Blofeld. The rendition for Lex Luthor in &quot;&quot;, and to a certain extent, various entries of the DC Animated Universe, were derived in part from Telly Savalas&#x27; portrayal of Blofeld in &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;. The character The Grand Master (and pet rabbit General Flopsy) from the CBBC series &quot;M.I. High&quot; (2007–2014) are heavily based on characteristics popularised in Blofeld.

In the fourth episode of the first season of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; in 1969, Eric Idle played Arthur Lemming, secret agent for the British Dental Association, who found himself up against the forces of The Big Cheese (Graham Chapman), a diabolical dentist who appeared out of a secret panel in the wall with a stuffed rabbit called Flopsy on his knee.

The character of Shakal, a villain from the 1980 Indian action film &quot;Shaan&quot; portrayed by Kulbhushan Kharbanda, was modelled after Blofeld in appearance and Kharbanda was especially cast in the role for his bald look.

In 1987, an edition of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; presented a skit called &quot;Bullets Aren&#x27;t Cheap&quot;, featuring Steve Martin as a particularly penurious Bond. That evening&#x27;s musical guest Sting portrayed a villain called &quot;Goldsting&quot;, who wore a Nehru jacket and, like The Big Cheese, carried a stuffed bunny rabbit.

Similar to &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; example, General Viggo (a white Persian cat) is the villain of the video game &quot;Fur Fighters&quot;, while his pet is a small mutant human named Fifi.

One of the two main villains of the 2005 video game &quot;&quot;, Khallos, is heavily based upon Blofeld, being presented as an evil genius with a white cat. One section of the game even allows the player to remotely control the cat.

<text>The Anti-Revolutionary Party (, ARP) was a Protestant conservative and Christian democratic political party in the Netherlands. The party was founded in 1879 by Abraham Kuyper, a neo-Calvinist theologian and minister who served as Prime Minister between 1901 and 1905. In 1980 the party merged with the Catholic People&#x27;s Party (KVP) and the Christian Historical Union (CHU) to form the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA).

==History==

===History before 1879===
The anti-revolutionary parliamentary caucus had existed since the 1840s. It represented orthodox tendencies within the Dutch Reformed Church. Under the leadership of Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer the anti-revolutionaries became a real political force, which opposed the liberal tendencies within the Dutch Reformed Church and the liberal tendencies within Dutch politics. Their three values were &quot;God, the Netherlands, and the House of Orange&quot;.

An important issue was public education, which in the view of the anti-revolutionaries should be Protestant-Christian in nature. The anti-revolutionaries had ties with the , which opposed the official re-establishment of Roman Catholic bishoprics, and a mixed relationship with (liberal-) conservatives in the House of Representatives, who also opposed reforms to the social and political system but often on the basis of a mix of liberal Protestantism and secular humanism. During the 1860s Groen van Prinsterer became more isolated from his conservative allies. He also began to reformulate his Protestant-Christian ideals, and began to plead for &quot;souvereiniteit in eigen kring&quot; (sphere sovereignty) instead of theocracy. This meant that instead of one Protestant-Christian society, Groen van Prinsterer wanted a Protestant society within a pluralistic society. Orthodox Protestants would have their own churches, schools, papers, political parties and sports clubs. This laid the basis for pillarisation, which was to dominate Dutch society between 1880 and 1960.

In 1864 Groen van Prinsterer began to correspond with a young Dutch Reformed theologian named Abraham Kuyper. Kuyper was heavily influenced by Groen van Prinsterer&#x27;s ideas and began to put the latter&#x27;s ideal of an orthodox Protestant society within Dutch society into practice.

===Foundation===
On 3 April 1879, Abraham Kuyper founded the ARP as part of the larger separate orthodox Protestant society within society. It was the first nationally organised political party in the Netherlands. An 1878 petition for equal payment for religious schools became one of the catalysts for the foundation of the political movement. In 1877, Kuyper had already written &quot;Our Program&quot; in which the political ideals of the ARP were written down (see below). Around the ARP the separate Protestant society began to grow: many Protestant schools were founded, a Protestant university (the Free University was founded in 1880), and a paper (&quot;De Standaard&quot;). In 1886, Kuyper broke free from the liberal Dutch Reformed Church (in Dutch: &quot;Nederlands-Hervormde Kerk&quot;) to found the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands in 1892 (in Dutch: &quot;Gereformeerde Kerken Nederland&quot;).

The ARP had one practical political goal: equalisation of payment between public and religious schools. It had one political strategy: the Antithesis between religious and non-religious parties, which meant that he sought to break the cooperation between liberals and Catholics and to create an alliance between Catholics and Protestants.

===1879–1917===

In 1879, thirteen anti-revolutionaries were among the hundred members of the House of Representatives, although not all were members of the ARP. During the period between 1879 and 1883, their numbers grew slowly, peaking at 19. After the 1884 election they had 21 members of parliament. In 1886 they won their first seat in the Senate.

In the 1888 election, the ARP won 31.4% of the vote and 27 seats. A confessional cabinet was formed led by the anti-revolutionary Aeneas Mackay Jr.: it combined anti-revolutionary and Catholic ministers, joined by two conservative independents. Because the liberals still controlled the Senate, many of the cabinet&#x27;s proposals met resistance there and the cabinet fell before the end of its four-year term.

In the 1891 election, the ARP lost 2% of its votes, but six of its seats. The confessional parties also lost their majority. A liberal cabinet, led by Van Tienhoven was formed. It proposed drastic changes to the census, which would result practically in universal male suffrage, proposed by minister Tak. The ARP was divided on the issue: Kuyper and a majority of the parliamentary party voted in favour of the law, while Alexander de Savornin Lohman vehemently opposed it. Kuyper had tactical reasons to support enlarged franchise – the &#x27;kleine luyden&#x27; (middle class) who would be allowed to vote often supported the ARP. De Savorin-Lohman opposed the law because it would imply some form of popular sovereignty instead of divine sovereignty. In 1894, this resulted in a split between the ARP and the group around De Savorin-Lohman. Party discipline also played a role in the conflict between Kuyper and De Savorin-Lohman: Kuyper, the party leader, favoured strong party discipline, while De Savorin Lohman opposed strong parties. The split results in the foundation of the Free Anti Revolutionary Party in 1898, which would become the Christian Historical Union in 1904. With De Savorin-Lohman a group of prominent party politicians left the party, including many of its aristocratic members (who like De Savorin-Lohman have double names). The CHU continued its opposition against universal suffrage and was more anti-papist than the ARP.

In the 1894 election, the ARP lost almost half of its vote and six of its twenty-one seats. The Catholics broke their alliance with the ARP and supported a conservative cabinet. In the 1897 election, the ARP won back some ground: it was supported by 26% of the electorate and won seventeen seats. The group around De Savorin Lohman, won 11% of the vote and six seats. A liberal cabinet was formed and the ARP was confined to opposition.

In 1901, the ARP won a decisive victory. It won 27.4% of the vote and 23 seats. A cabinet was formed out of the ARP, the Catholics and the group around De Savorin-Lohman, now called the Christian Historical Party. The cabinet was led by Kuyper, being the first person to formally lead the cabinet for four years. It was characterised by Kuypers&#x27; authoritarian leadership. This can best be seen by the railway strike of 1903, in which Kuyper showed no mercy to the strikers and instead pushed several particularly harsh anti-strike laws through parliament. After the Senate, where there was a liberal majority, rejected Kuypers&#x27; law on higher education, which sought to bring equal titles for alumni of the Free University, which Kuyper himself founded, Kuyper called for new elections for the Senate. With a confessional majority in the Senate, the law was pushed through.

In the 1905 election, the ARP lost only 3% of the vote, but eight seats, although it was able to strengthen its position in the Senate. Kuyper, the party&#x27;s leader, lost his own seat in Amsterdam to a progressive liberal. Theo Heemskerk led the anti-revolutionary parliamentary party. A minority liberal cabinet was formed. Former anti-revolutionary MP Staalman left ARP and founded the Christian Democratic Party, which later became the Christian Democratic Union, which would play a minor role in the interbellum political landscape.

In 1908, Kuyper returned to the House of Representatives. After a crisis in the liberal cabinet Theo Heemskerk was given the chance to form a new cabinet. A minority confessional cabinet was formed. In the 1909 election the ARP won 3% of vote and twenty-five seats. The Heemskerk cabinet continues.

In 1912, Kuyper left national politics because of health reasons, and in 1913, he was elected to the Senate. In the 1913 election, the ARP lost 6% of the votes. The party lost more than half of its seats, leaving them with 11 seats overall. Another minority liberal cabinet was formed. The leadership of the ARP lay in the hands of less prominent politicians. Although a relatively small opposition party, the ARP played an important role in Dutch politics. The liberal minority cabinet, led by Cort van der Linden sought to resolve two important issues in Dutch politics: the conflict over the equalisation of payment for religious schools and universal suffrage. In the constitution change of 1917 both items were resolved. The ARP was given equal payment for religious schools, but it had to accept women&#x27;s suffrage and proportional representation.

===1917–1945===
After the Pacification of 1917, marked by the introduction of universal suffrage, the party never received more than twenty percent of the vote. The 1918 election provided a decisive test for the party, where the party won two additional seats. The three confessional parties won 50 seats. The confessional parties formed a new cabinet, led by the Catholic Charles Ruijs de Beerenbrouck. The ARP supplied three ministers and former prime minister Theo Heemskerk became Minister of Justice. A group of concerned anti-revolutionaries, led by Gerrit Kersten, founded the Reformed Political Party, which opposed universal suffrage and cooperation with the Catholics. The electorate of the ARP changed in the interbellum – the difference between lower class Protestants who voted ARP and middle class Protestants who voted CHU began to disappear, with religious differences between the Dutch Reformed Church (CHU) and the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands (ARP) becoming more important.

In the 1922 election, former minister of war Hendrikus Colijn became the leader of the ARP. He emphasised defence and fiscal conservatism as core issues of the party. With him the ARP got sixteen seats in the House of Representatives and fifteen in the Senate. He became Minister of Finance in the second cabinet of Charles Ruijs de Beerenbrouck. He led the party in the 1925 election; the party lost three seats in this election. The ARP continued in government with Jan Donner as minister of Justice. In the 1929 election, the ARP lost another seat. The confessional parties continued to govern.

In the 1930s, with the growing international political threats and economic crisis, the ARP began to regain its popularity, under the leadership of Colijn. In 1933, the ARP gained two seats and Colijn formed a broad cabinet comprising the Roman Catholic State Party (RKSP), CHU, ARP, Liberal State Party (LSP) and Free-thinking Democratic League (VDB). Jan Schouten led the party&#x27;s parliamentary party. Between 1933 and 1939, Colijn led several parliamentary and extra-parliamentary cabinets with changing composition, although the CHU, ARP, and RKSP continued to form the core of the cabinet. Colijn refused to devalue the guilder but was unable to resolve the economic crisis. In 1937 the ARP gained three seats and reached a historic 17 seats. Colijn continued to govern. In 1939, his fifth cabinet fell and Colijn was succeeded by Dirk Jan de Geer. Pieter Gerbrandy joined the cabinet without support of his parliamentary party.

During World War II, members of the ARP played a role in both the governments-in-exile, of which many were led by Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy and the resistance movements. The resistance paper &quot;Trouw&quot; was founded by ARP members. Many future ARP MPs began their political career in the Dutch resistance.

===1945–1980===

After World War II, the ARP returned to Dutch politics. The anti-revolutionary Jo Meynen was minister of War, albeit without support of his parliamentary party.

In the 1946 election, Jan Schouten led the party. It lost four seats. During the formation, it became clear that the ARP could not govern: it strongly opposed the decolonisation of the Dutch Indies. It saw maintenance of the Dutch colonial empire as necessary for the continued wealth and power of the Netherlands. The Labour Party (PvdA) and the Catholics however favoured decolonisation, under heavy pressure from the United States. For six years the ARP was relatively isolated. In 1944, a theological conflict within the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands led to a break between the Reformed Church and the Reformed Churches (liberated). This also had political repercussions; in 1948, the Reformed Political League was set up by members of the liberated churches. They were unable to win seats until 1963. The party remained stable in the 1948 election and remained in opposition.
After the 1952 election, the ARP returned to the cabinet, which consisted of the confessional ARP, CHU, KVP and the social democratic PvdA, led by the social democrat Drees. Jelle Zijlstra became minister of economic affairs. In the 1956 election in which Jelle Zijlstra became political leader the ARP kept its 10% of the vote, but due to the enlargement of the House of Representatives it got 15 seats. A conflict between the PvdA and the KVP caused the early downfall of the cabinet. The ARP remained part of the care-taker cabinet led by Louis Beel. In the 1959 election the ARP lost another seat. It continued to be part of the cabinet, now led by Jan de Quay. The three confessional parties were joined by the conservative liberal People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy.
After the 1963 election, the cabinet continued, now led by Victor Marijnen. The new anti-revolutionary leader Barend Biesheuvel became Minister of Agriculture. In 1965 this cabinet fell over a conflict between the liberals and the confessionals. The PvdA joins the ARP and the KVP in a new cabinet, led by Jo Cals. This cabinet fell after one year, over conflict between the KVP and PvdA over government spending. The ARP joins the PvdA in its plea for more government spending. A caretaker government is formed by the KVP and ARP, led by former ARP-leader Jelle Zijlstra. In the 1967 election campaign, the ARP, CHU and KVP declared that they would continue to govern together. This led to considerable conflict with the KVP, which also spilled over into the ARP, as the younger generation wanted to govern with the PvdA. The ARP gained two seats, but the KVP loses eight seats. A new liberal/confessional cabinet is formed. Biesheuvel does not enter government but instead chooses to remain in parliament.

In the 1971 election, the ARP lost two seats, and its confessional allies (KVP and CHU) lost seven and three seats respectively. They faced competition from the left-wing Christian Political Party of Radicals (PPR), which was formed by former KVP members and joined by some prominent anti-revolutionaries, including Bas de Gaay Fortman, son of Wilhelm de Gaay Fortman, one of the party&#x27;s ministers. The liberal/confessional cabinet lost its majority. A new government was formed consisting of liberals and confessionals, now joined by Democratic Socialists &#x27;70, a group of moderate social democrats who left the &quot;radicalising&quot; PvdA. This cabinet was led by Barend Biesheuvel. Willem Aantjes became the chair of the party&#x27;s parliamentary party. Under his leadership the ARP fashioned itself a new left-wing &quot;radical evangelical&quot; image, while the CHU retains its conservative image. The cabinet did not hold together for long: DS &#x27;70 were unable to agree with proposed budget cuts, and the cabinet fell. In the subsequent election the ARP gained one seat. After long coalition talks several prominent anti-revolutionaries, including Wilhelm de Gaay Fortman, joined the progressive cabinet led by Joop den Uyl. The cabinet was riddled with conflicts between confessional and progressive politicians.

===Dissolution===

Meanwhile, a process of merger had started between the KVP, ARP and CHU. In 1974 they founded a federation called the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA). In the formation of a common Christian democratic identity anti-revolutionary Aantjes played a decisive role: he orients the party towards the sermon on the Mount where Christ says that Christians should clothe the naked and feed the hungry. In the 1977 election, they campaigned together under as the CDA. Some prominent anti-revolutionaries, like Aantjes did not agree the CDA/VVD cabinet that was formed after the election and wanted to continue with the PvdA. However, they supported the cabinet politically. A group of these anti-revolutionaries left the CDA in 1981 to found the left-wing Christian Evangelical People&#x27;s Party.

While the ARP was one of the dominant forces in the merged party, it was not until 2002 that a CDA member with anti-revolutionary roots became Prime Minister, Jan Peter Balkenende.

===Name===
The Anti-Revolutionary Party derived its name from its opposition to the ideals of the liberal French Revolution (and certainly against those of Marxists). The label &quot;conservative&quot; was already taken by a parliamentary group of monarchists and colonialists, who fell out of favour in the late 19th century. In its early years, the terms &quot;anti-revolutionary&quot; and &quot;Christian historical&quot; were used interchangeably. With the split between the ARP and the Christian Historical Union the terms began to gain their own separate meanings.

==Ideology and issues==
The ARP started out as an orthodox Protestant party, heavily opposed to the ideals of the French revolution. Against the revolution, they put the Bible: instead of liberty, it favoured divine providence, instead of equality it favoured hierarchy and instead of brotherhood it favoured sovereignty in its own circle. Its ideals could be summed up in the tripartite motto &quot;God, the Netherlands and the House of Orange&quot;. For most of its history it maintained this conservative Protestant image. In the 1960s and 1970s the party began to adopt a more left-wing &quot;radical evangelical&quot; image.

===God===
The ARP was a confessional Protestant party which based its politics on the Bible and opposed the concept of popular sovereignty.

The concept of sphere sovereignty was very important for the party. It wanted to create an independent Protestant society within the Dutch society, with its own schools, papers, hospitals etc. It sought equal government finances for its own institutions. Societies should care for their own, therefore they opposed a large role for the state in social-economic policy.

The ARP saw an important role for the state in upholding the values of the Dutch people. It was socially conservative: it opposed mixed-sex education, mandatory vaccination, divorce, pornography, euthanasia, abortion etc. It also favoured capital punishment.

===Netherlands===
The party can be seen as rather nationalist. It favoured a strong defence to retain Dutch neutrality. It opposed decolonisation. It saw the colonies in Indonesia as vital for the continued wealth and influence of the Dutch people. It also wanted to enlighten the native population with Christian values.

===Monarchy===
The ARP favoured monarchy, and saw the House of Orange as historically and religiously linked to the Dutch people. It opposed changes to Dutch political system, it wanted to retain bicameralism, opposed popular referendums etc. Its commitment to universal suffrage was only tactical as the ARP expected that it would be able to gain more seats this way. Principally it wanted Householder Franchise where the head of the household would vote for his family.

The party was fiscally conservative: the Dutch government should be like a good father: it should not spend more than it got through taxes.

===Christian radicalism===
In the 1960s and 1970s, the party became more left-wing on many issues. Social justice became an important ideal of the party, both nationally, where it began to favour a stronger welfare state, and internationally, where development aid became an important issue.

===Municipal and provincial government===
The party was particularly strong in rural municipal and provincial governments. Especially in Friesland, Overijssel, Zeeland and the Veluwe the party was particularly strong.

==Electorate==
The electorate of the ARP has seen three decisive shifts, especially in its relation with the CHU, the other Protestant party. Although dates are given here, the changes were gradual.

* Between 1879 and 1917 the ARP appealed to &quot;&quot; (Dutch for the little people), the middle class, farmers, and workers, as a confessional party that favoured universal suffrage.
* Between 1917 and 1967 the ARP appealed to members of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands.
* Between 1967 and 1977, in the time of secularisation and depillarisation the party was able to appeal to younger generations, as the more left-wing confessional party.

==Organisation==

===National organisation===
The party&#x27;s national secretariat was long housed in the Kuyper House in The Hague. It now houses the national secretariat of the Christian Democratic Appeal.

===Linked organisations===
The party published the magazine &quot;Nederlandse Gedachten&quot; (&quot;Dutch Thoughts&quot;). Its youth organisation was the &quot;Anti-Revolutionaire Jongeren Studieclubs&quot; (&quot;Anti-Revolutionary Youth Studyclubs&quot;). Its scientific institute was the Dr. A. Kuyper foundation.

===International organisations===
Internationally the ARP was a relatively isolated party. In the European Parliament its members sat in the Christian Democratic faction.

===Pillarised organisations===
The party had close ties to many Protestant organisations, such as the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, the Protestant broadcaster NCRV, the employers&#x27; organisation NCW, the trade union CNV, and the paper &quot;De Standaard&quot; and after World War II, the &quot;Trouw&quot;. Together these organisations formed the Protestant pillar.

===Relationships to other parties===
Because of the philosophy of Antithesis, it has strong links with the Catholic parties (General League/Roman Catholic State Party/Catholic People&#x27;s Party (KVP) and the Christian Historical Union (CHU). In the period 1879 to 1917 it saw the Liberal Union as its main opponent. After 1917 it saw the social democratic Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party as its main opponent, and it formed several governments with liberals.

After World War II, the ARP became more isolated because of its position on the decolonisation of the Dutch East Indies. After Indonesia became independent, it joined the Labour Party (PvdA), KVP and the CHU in the cabinet. Links with the KVP were exceptionally good and it governed with the KVP and either the CHU and the PvdA. After the 1960s, calls to govern with the PvdA became stronger.

==International comparison==
Internationally, the ARP was very similar to the Scandinavian Christian Democratic parties (such as the Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and the Finnish Christian Democrats), that are all socially and fiscally conservative, with a social heart. All have their roots in orthodox tendencies within the national church. In its conservative policies the ARP also shared similarities with the UK Conservatives (the paternalistic or moderate conservative wing of that party). Comparing the ARP to an American party is more difficult, but is seemed somewhat close to the moderate wing of the US Republicans (although the ARP was more socially inclined) or the conservative wing of the US Democratic Party.

<doc id="99221" wikidata="Q489268" url="?curid=99221" title="World government">
<text>World government is the concept of a single political authority with jurisdiction over all of Earth and humanity. It is conceived in a variety of forms, from tyrannical to democratic, which reflects its wide array of proponents and detractors.

A world government with executive, legislative, and judicial functions and an administrative apparatus has never existed. The inception of the United Nations (UN) in the mid-20th century remains the closest approximation to a world government, although it lacks the enforcement powers and authority of a typical national government. Nevertheless, the organization is commonly viewed as either a model for, or preliminary step towards, a global government.

The concept of universal governance has existed since antiquity and been the subject of discussion, debate, and even advocacy by some kings, philosophers, religious leaders, and secular humanists. Some of these individuals have proposed world government is a natural and inevitable outcome of human social evolution, and interest in it has coincided with increasing globalization and those societal trends resulting from or associated with it. Proponents have suggested it would provide a solution to problems that stem from anarchy in the international system, as well as enable collective solutions to global problems. Opponents of world government, who come from a broad political spectrum, view the concept as a tool for violent totalitarianism, unfeasible, or simply unnecessary. 

==Definition==
Alexander Wendt defines a state as an &quot;organization possessing a monopoly on the legitimate use of organized violence within a society.&quot; According to Wendt, a world state would need to fulfill the following requirements:

# Monopoly on organized violence – states have exclusive use of legitimate force within their own territory.
# Legitimacy – perceived as right by their populations, and possibly the global community.
# Sovereignty – possessing common power and legitimacy.
# Corporate action –  a collection of individuals who act together in a systematic way.

Wendt argues that a world government would not require a centrally controlled army or a central decision-making body, as long as the four conditions are fulfilled. In order to develop a world state, three changes must occur in the world system:

# Universal security community – a peaceful system of binding dispute resolution without threat of interstate violence.
# Universal collective security – unified response to crimes and threats.
# Supranational authority – binding decisions are made that apply to each and every state.

The development of a world government is conceptualized by Wendt as a process through five stages:

# System of states;
# Society of states;
# World society;
# Collective security;
# World state.

Wendt argues that a struggle among sovereign individuals results in the formation of a collective identity and eventually a state. The same forces are present within the international system and could possibly, and potentially inevitably lead to the development of a world state through this five-stage process. When the world state would emerge, the traditional expression of states would become localized expressions of the world state. This process occurs within the default state of anarchy present in the world system.

Immanuel Kant conceptualized the state as sovereign individuals formed out of conflict. Part of the traditional philosophical objections to a world state (Kant, Hegel) are overcome by modern technological innovations. Wendt argues that new methods of communication and coordination can overcome these challenges.

A colleague of Wendt in the field of International Relations, Max Ostrovsky, conceptualized the development of a world government as a process in one stage: The world will be divided on two rival blocs, one based on North America and another on Eurasia, which clash in World War III and, &quot;if civilization survives,&quot; the victorious power conquers the rest of the world, annexes and establishes world state. Remarkably, Wendt also supposes the alternative of universal conquest leading to world state, provided the conquering power recognizes &quot;its victims as full subjects.&quot; In such case, the mission is accomplished &quot;without intermediate stages of development.&quot;

==Pre-industrialized philosophy==
===Antiquity===
World government was an aspiration of ancient rulers as early as the Bronze Age (3300 to 1200 BCE); ancient Egyptian kings aimed to rule &quot;All That the Sun Encircles&quot;, Mesopotamian kings &quot;All from the Sunrise to the Sunset&quot;, and ancient Chinese and Japanese emperors &quot;All under Heaven&quot;.

The Chinese had a particularly well-developed notion of world government in the form of Great Unity, or (), a historical model for a united and just society bound by moral virtue and principles of good governance. The Han dynasty, which successfully united much of China for over four centuries, evidently aspired to this vision by erecting an Altar of the Great Unity in 113 BCE.

Contemporaneously, the ancient Greek historian Polybius described Roman rule over much of the known world at the time as a &quot;marvelous&quot; achievement worthy of consideration by future historians. The &quot;Pax Romana&quot;, a roughly two-century period of stable Roman hegemony across three continents, reflected the positive aspirations of a world government, as it was deemed to have brought prosperity and security to what was once a politically and culturally fractious region. The Adamites were a Christian sect who desired to organize an early form of world government.

===Dante&#x27;s Universal Monarchy===
The idea of world government outlived the fall of Rome for centuries, particularly in its former heartland of Italy. Medieval peace movements such as the Waldensians gave impetus to utopian philosophers like Marsilius of Padua to envision a world without war. In his fourteenth-century work &quot;De Monarchia&quot;, Florentine poet and philosopher Dante Alighieri, considered by some English Protestants to be a proto-Protestant, appealed for a universal monarchy that would work separate from and uninfluenced by the Roman Catholic Church to establish peace in humanity&#x27;s lifetime and the afterlife, respectively:

But what has been the condition of the world since that day the seamless robe [of Pax Romana] first suffered mutilation by the claws of avarice, we can read—would that we could not also see! O human race! what tempests must need toss thee, what treasure be thrown into the sea, what shipwrecks must be endured, so long as thou, like a beast of many heads, strivest after diverse ends! Thou art sick in either intellect, or sick likewise in thy affection. Thou healest not thy high understanding by argument irrefutable, nor thy lower by the countenance of experience. Nor dost thou heal thy affection by the sweetness of divine persuasion, when the voice of the Holy Spirit breathes upon thee, &#x27;Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!&#x27;

Di Gattinara was an Italian diplomat who widely promoted Dante&#x27;s &quot;De Monarchia&quot; and its call for a universal monarchy. An advisor of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, and the chancellor of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, he conceived global government as uniting all Christian nations under a Respublica Christiana, which was the only political entity able to establish world peace.

===Francisco de Vitoria (1483–1546)===
The Spanish philosopher Francisco de Vitoria is considered an author of &quot;global political philosophy&quot; and international law, along with Alberico Gentili and Hugo Grotius. This came at a time when the University of Salamanca was engaged in unprecedented thought concerning human rights, international law, and early economics based on the experiences of the Spanish Empire. De Vitoria conceived of the , or the &quot;republic of the whole world&quot;.

===Hugo Grotius (1583–1645)===
The Dutch philosopher and jurist Hugo Grotius, widely regarded as a founder of international law, believed in the eventual formation of a world government to enforce it. His book, &quot;De jure belli ac pacis&quot; (&quot;On the Law of War and Peace&quot;), published in Paris in 1625, is still cited as a foundational work in the field. Though he does not advocate for world government &quot;per se,&quot; Grotius argues that a &quot;common law among nations&quot;, consisting of a framework of principles of natural law, bind all people and societies regardless of local custom.

===Immanuel Kant (1724–1804)===

In his essay &quot;Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch&quot; (1795), Kant describes three basic requirements for organizing human affairs to permanently abolish the threat of present and future war, and, thereby, help establish a new era of lasting peace throughout the world. Kant described his proposed peace program as containing two steps.

The &quot;Preliminary Articles&quot; described the steps that should be taken immediately, or with all deliberate speed:

# &quot;No Secret Treaty of Peace Shall Be Held Valid in Which There Is Tacitly Reserved Matter for a Future War&quot;
# &quot;No Independent States, Large or Small, Shall Come under the Dominion of Another State by Inheritance, Exchange, Purchase, or Donation&quot;
# &quot;Standing Armies Shall in Time Be Totally Abolished&quot;
# &quot;National Debts Shall Not Be Contracted with a View to the External Friction of States&quot;
# &quot;No State Shall by Force Interfere with the Constitution or Government of Another State,
# &quot;No State Shall, during War, Permit Such Acts of Hostility Which Would Make Mutual Confidence in the Subsequent Peace Impossible: Such Are the Employment of Assassins (), Poisoners (), Breach of Capitulation, and Incitement to Treason () in the Opposing State&quot;

Three Definitive Articles would provide not merely a cessation of hostilities, but a foundation on which to build a peace.

# &quot;The Civil Constitution of Every State Should Be Republican&quot;
# &quot;The Law of Nations Shall be Founded on a Federation of Free States&quot;
# &quot;The Law of World Citizenship Shall Be Limited to Conditions of Universal Hospitality&quot;
Kant argued against a world government on the grounds that it would be prone to tyranny. He instead advocated for league of independent republican states akin to the intergovernmental organizations that would emerge over a century and a half later.

===Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762–1814)===
The year of the battle at Jena (1806), when Napoleon overwhelmed Prussia, Johann Gottlieb Fichte in &quot;Characteristics of the Present Age&quot; described what he perceived to be a very deep and dominant historical trend:

==Supranational movements==

International organizations started forming in the late 19th century, among the earliest being the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1863, the Telegraphic Union in 1865 and the Universal Postal Union in 1874. The increase in international trade at the turn of the 20th century accelerated the formation of international organizations, and, by the start of World War I in 1914, there were approximately 450 of them.

Some notable philosophers and political leaders were also promoting the value of world government during the post-industrial, pre-World War era. Ulysses S. Grant, US president, was convinced that rapid advances in technology and industry would result in greater unity and eventually &quot;one nation, so that armies and navies are no longer necessary.&quot; In China, political reformer Kang Youwei viewed human political organization growing into fewer, larger units, eventually into &quot;one world&quot;. Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh founded the Baháʼí Faith teaching that the establishment of world unity and a global federation of nations was a key principle of the religion. Author H. G. Wells was a strong proponent of the creation of a world state, arguing that such a state would ensure world peace and justice. 
Karl Marx, the traditional founder of communism, predicted a socialist epoch in which the working class throughout the world will unite to render nationalism meaningless. Anti-Communists believed world government was a goal of World Communism.

Support for the idea of establishing international law grew during this period as well. The Institute of International Law was formed in 1873 by Belgian jurist Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns, leading to the creation of concrete legal drafts, for example by the Swiss Johaan Bluntschli in 1866. In 1883, James Lorimer published &quot;The Institutes of the Law of Nations&quot; in which he explored the idea of a world government establishing the global rule of law. The first embryonic world parliament, called the Inter-Parliamentary Union, was organized in 1886 by Cremer and Passy, composed of legislators from many countries. In 1904 the Union formally proposed &quot;an international congress which should meet periodically to discuss international questions&quot;.

=== Theodore Roosevelt ===
As early as his 1905 statement to Congress, U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt highlighted the need for &quot;an organization of the civilized nations&quot; and cited the international arbitration tribunal at The Hague as a role model to be advanced further. During his acceptance speech for the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize, Roosevelt described a world federation as a &quot;master stroke&quot; and advocated for some form of international police power to maintain peace. Historian William Roscoe Thayer observed that the speech &quot;foreshadowed many of the terms which have since been preached by the advocates of a League of Nations&quot;, which would not be established for another 14 years. Hamilton Holt of &quot;The Independent&quot; lauded Roosevelt&#x27;s plan for a &quot;Federation of the World&quot;, writing that not since the &quot;Great Design&quot; of Henry IV has &quot;so comprehensive a plan&quot; for universal peace been proposed.

Although Roosevelt supported global government conceptually, he was critical of specific proposals and of leaders of organizations promoting the cause of international governance. According to historian John Milton Cooper, Roosevelt praised the plan of his presidential successor, William Howard Taft, for &quot;a league under existing conditions and with such wisdom in refusing to let adherence to the principle be clouded by insistence upon improper or unimportant methods of enforcement that we can speak of the league as a practical matter.&quot;

In a 1907 letter to Andrew Carnegie, Roosevelt expressed his hope &quot;to see The Hague Court greatly increased in power and permanency&quot;, and in one of his very last public speeches he said: &quot;Let us support any reasonable plan whether in the form of a League of Nations or in any other shape, which bids fair to lessen the probable number of future wars and to limit their scope.&quot;

===Founding of the League of Nations===

The League of Nations (LoN) was an intergovernmental organization founded as a result of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919–1920. At its largest size from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members. The League&#x27;s goals included upholding the Rights of Man, such as the rights of non-whites, women, and soldiers; disarmament, preventing war through collective security, settling disputes between countries through negotiation, diplomacy, and improving global quality of life. The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift in thought from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and so depended on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions and economic sanctions and provide an army, when needed. However, these powers proved reluctant to do so. Lacking many of the key elements necessary to maintain world peace, the League failed to prevent World War II. Adolf Hitler withdrew Germany from the League of Nations once he planned to take over Europe. The rest of the Axis Powers soon followed him. Having failed its primary goal, the League of Nations fell apart. The League of Nations consisted of the Assembly, the council, and the Permanent Secretariat. Below these were many agencies. The Assembly was where delegates from all member states conferred. Each country was allowed three representatives and one vote.

===Competing visions during World War II===
The Nazi Party of Germany envisaged the establishment of a world government under the complete hegemony of the Third Reich. In its move to overthrow the post-World War I Treaty of Versailles, Germany had already withdrawn itself from the League of Nations, and it did not intend to join a similar internationalist organization ever again. In his stated political aim of expanding the living space (&quot;Lebensraum&quot;) of the Germanic people by destroying or driving out &quot;lesser-deserving races&quot; in and from other territories, dictator Adolf Hitler devised an ideological system of self-perpetuating expansionism, in which the growth of a state&#x27;s population would require the conquest of more territory which would, in turn, lead to a further growth in population which would then require even more conquests. In 1927, Rudolf Hess relayed to Walther Hewel Hitler&#x27;s belief that world peace could only be acquired &quot;when one power, the racially best one, has attained uncontested supremacy&quot;. When this control would be achieved, this power could then set up for itself a world police and assure itself &quot;the necessary living space... The lower races will have to restrict themselves accordingly&quot;.

During its imperial period (1868–1947), the Japanese Empire elaborated a worldview, , translated as &quot;eight corners of the world under one roof&quot;. This was the idea behind the attempt to establish a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and behind the struggle for world domination. The British Empire, the largest in history, was viewed by some historians as a form of world government.

The Atlantic Charter was a published statement agreed between the United Kingdom and the United States. It was intended as the blueprint for the postwar world after World War II, and turned out to be the foundation for many of the international agreements that currently shape the world. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the post-war independence of British and French possessions, and much more are derived from the Atlantic Charter. The Atlantic charter was made to show the goals of the allied powers during World War II. It first started with the United States and Great Britain, and later all the allies would follow the charter. Some goals include access to raw materials, reduction of trade restrictions, and freedom from fear and wants. The name, The Atlantic Charter, came from a newspaper that coined the title. However, Winston Churchill would use it, and from then on the Atlantic Charter was the official name. In retaliation, the Axis powers would raise their morale and try to work their way into Great Britain. The Atlantic Charter was a stepping stone into the creation of the United Nations.

On June 5, 1948, at the dedication of the War Memorial in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S. President Harry S. Truman remarked, &quot;We must make the United Nations continue to work, and to be a going concern, to see that difficulties between nations may be settled just as we settle difficulties between States here in the United States. When Kansas and Colorado fall out over the waters in the Arkansas River, they don&#x27;t go to war over it; they go to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the matter is settled in a just and honorable way. There is not a difficulty in the whole world that cannot be settled in exactly the same way in a world court&quot;. The cultural moment of the late 1940s was the peak of World Federalism among Americans.

===Founding of the United Nations===

World War II (1939–1945) resulted in an unprecedented scale of destruction of lives (over 60 million dead, most of them civilians), and the use of weapons of mass destruction. Some of the acts committed against civilians during the war were on such a massive scale of savagery, they came to be widely considered as crimes against humanity itself. As the war&#x27;s conclusion drew near, many shocked voices called for the establishment of institutions able to permanently prevent deadly international conflicts. This led to the founding of the United Nations (UN) in 1945, which adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948.

Many, however, felt that the UN, essentially a forum for discussion and coordination between sovereign governments, was insufficiently empowered for the task. A number of prominent persons, such as Albert Einstein, Winston Churchill, Bertrand Russell, Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, called on governments to proceed further by taking gradual steps towards forming an effectual federal world government.

The United Nations main goal is to work on international law, international security, economic development, human rights, social progress, and eventually world peace. The United Nations replaced the League of Nations in 1945, after World War II. Almost every internationally recognized country is in the U.N.; as it contains 193 member states out of the 196 total nations of the world. The United Nations gather regularly in order to solve big problems throughout the world. There are six official languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish.

The United Nations is also financed by some of the wealthiest nations. The flag shows the Earth from a map that shows all of the populated continents.

==== United Nations Parliamentary Assembly (UNPA) ====
A United Nations Parliamentary Assembly (UNPA) is a proposed addition to the United Nations System that would allow for participation of member nations&#x27; legislators and, eventually, direct election of UN parliament members by citizens worldwide. The idea of a world parliament was raised at the founding of the League of Nations in the 1920s and again following the end of World War II in 1945, but remained dormant throughout the Cold War.

In the 1990s and 2000s, the rise of global trade and the power of world organizations that govern it led to calls for a parliamentary assembly to scrutinize their activity. The Campaign for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly was formed in 2007 by Democracy Without Borders to coordinate pro-UNPA efforts, which as of January 2019 has received the support of over 1,500 Members of Parliament from over 100 countries worldwide, in addition to numerous non-governmental organizations, Nobel and Right Livelihood laureates and heads or former heads of state or government and foreign ministers.

==== Garry Davis ====

In France, 1948, Garry Davis began an unauthorized speech calling for a world government from the balcony of the UN General Assembly, until he was dragged away by the guards. Davis renounced his American citizenship and started a Registry of World Citizens. On September 4, 1953, Davis announced from the city hall of Ellsworth, Maine, the formation of the &quot;World Government of World Citizens&quot; based on three &quot;World Laws&quot;: One God (or Absolute Value), One World, and One Humanity. Following this declaration, he formed the United World Service Authority in New York City as the administrative agency of the new government. Davis claimed this agency was mandated by Article 21, Section 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Its first task was to design and begin selling &quot;World Passports&quot;, which the organisation argues is legitimatized by on Article 13, Section 2 of the UDHR.

===World Federalist Movement===
The years between the end of World War II and the start of the Korean War—which roughly marked the entrenchment of Cold War polarity—saw a flourishing of the nascent world federalist movement. Wendell Willkie&#x27;s 1943 book &quot;One World&quot; sold over 2 million copies, laying out many of the argument and principles that would inspire global federalism. A contemporaneous work, Emery Reves&#x27; &quot;The Anatomy of Peace&quot; (1945), argued for replacing the UN with a federal world government. The world Federalist movement in the U.S., led by diverse figures such as Lola Maverick Lloyd, Grenville Clark, Norman Cousins, and Alan Cranston, grew larger and more prominent: in 1947, several grassroots organizations merged to form the United World Federalists—later renamed the World Federalist Association, then Citizens for Global Solutions—claiming 47,000 members by 1949.

Similar movements concurrently formed in many other countries, culminating in a 1947 meeting in Montreux, Switzerland that formed a global coalition called the World Federalist Movement (WFM). By 1950, the movement claimed 56 member groups in 22 countries, with some 156,000 members.

==== Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution ====
In 1949, six U.S. states—California, Connecticut, Florida, Maine, New Jersey, and North Carolina—applied for an Article V convention to propose an amendment &quot;to enable the participation of the United States in a world federal government&quot;. Multiple other state legislatures introduced or debated the same proposal. These resolutions were part of this effort.

During the 81st United States Congress (1949–1951), multiple resolutions were introduced favoring a world federation.

==== Chicago World Constitution draft ====
A committee of academics and intellectuals formed by Robert Maynard Hutchins of the University of Chicago published a &quot;Preliminary Draft of a World Constitution&quot; and from 1947 to 1951 published a magazine edited by the daughter of Thomas Mann, Elisabeth Mann Borgese, which was devoted to world government; its title was &quot;Common Cause&quot;.

==== Albert Einstein and World Constitution ====

Einstein grew increasingly convinced that the world was veering off course. He arrived at the conclusion that the gravity of the situation demanded more profound actions and the establishment of a &quot;world government&quot; was the only logical solution. In his &quot;Open Letter to the General Assembly of the United Nations&quot; of October 1947, Einstein emphasized the urgent need for international cooperation and the establishment of a world government. In the year 1948, Einstein invited United World Federalists, Inc. (UWF) president Cord Meyer to a meeting of the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists (ECAS) and joined UWF as a member of the advisory board. Einstein and ECAS assisted UEF in fundraising and provided supporting material. Einstein described United World Federalists as: &quot;the group nearest to our aspirations&quot;. Einstein and other prominent figures sponsored the Peoples&#x27; World Convention (PWC), which took place in 1950–51 and later continued in the form of world constituent assemblies in 1968, 1977, 1978–79, and 1991. This effort was successful in creating a world constitution and a Provisional World Government.

Constitution for the Federation of Earth drafted by international legal experts during world constituent assemblies in 1968 and finalized in 1991, is a framework of a world federalist government. A Provisional World Government consisting of a Provisional World Parliament (PWP), a transitional international legislative body, operates under the framework of this world constitution. This parliament convenes to work on global issues, gathering delegates from different countries.

==Cold War==

By 1950, the Cold War began to dominate international politics and the UN Security Council became effectively paralyzed by its permanent members&#x27; ability to exercise veto power. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 82 and 83 backed the defense of South Korea, although the Soviets were then boycotting meetings in protest.

While enthusiasm for multinational federalism in Europe incrementally led, over the following decades, to the formation of the European Union, the Cold War eliminated the prospects of any progress towards federation with a more global scope. Global integration became stagnant during the Cold War, and the conflict became the driver behind one-third of all wars during the period. The idea of world government all but disappeared from wide public discourse.

===Post–Cold War===
As the Cold War dwindled in 1991, interest in a federal world government was renewed. When the conflict ended by 1992, without the external assistance, many proxy wars petered out or ended by negotiated settlements. This kicked off a period in the 1990s of unprecedented international activism and an expansion of international institutions. According to the &quot;Human Security Report 2005&quot;, this was the first effective functioning of the United Nations as it was designed to operate.

The most visible achievement of the world federalism movement during the 1990s is the Rome Statute of 1998, which led to the establishment of the International Criminal Court in 2002. In Europe, progress towards forming a federal union of European states gained much momentum, starting in 1952 as a trade deal between the German and French people led, in 1992, to the Maastricht Treaty that established the name and enlarged the agreement that the European Union is based upon. The EU expanded (1995, 2004, 2007, 2013) to encompass, in 2013, over half a billion people in 28 member states (27 after Brexit). Following the EU&#x27;s example, other supranational unions were established, including the African Union in 2002, the Union of South American Nations in 2008, and the Eurasian Economic Union in 2015.

== Current system of global governance ==
, there is no functioning global international military, executive, legislature, judiciary, or constitution with jurisdiction over the entire planet.

=== No world government ===
The world is divided geographically and demographically into mutually exclusive territories and political structures called states which are independent and sovereign in most cases. There are numerous bodies, institutions, unions, coalitions, agreements and contracts between these units of authority, but, except in cases where one nation is under military occupation by another, &quot;all&quot; such arrangements depend on the continued consent of the participant nations. Countries that violate or do not enforce international laws may be subject to penalty or coercion, often in the form of economic limitations such as embargos by cooperating countries, even if the violating country is not part of the United Nations. In this way a country&#x27;s cooperation in international affairs is voluntary, but non-cooperation still has diplomatic consequences.

=== International criminal courts ===
A functioning system of International law encompasses international treaties, customs and globally accepted legal principles. With the exceptions of cases brought before the ICC and ICJ, the laws are interpreted by national courts. Many violations of treaty or customary law obligations are overlooked. International Criminal Court (ICC) was a relatively recent development in international law, it is the first permanent international criminal court established to ensure that the gravest international crimes (war crimes, genocide, other crimes against humanity, etc.) do not go unpunished. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court establishing the ICC and its jurisdiction was signed by 139 national governments, of which 100 ratified it by October 2005.

=== Inter-governmental organizations ===

The United Nations (UN) is the primary formal organization coordinating activities between states on a global scale and the only inter-governmental organization with near-universal membership (193 governments). In addition to the main organs and various humanitarian programs and commissions of the UN itself, there are about 20 functional organizations affiliated with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), such as the World Health Organization, the International Labour Organization, and International Telecommunication Union. Of particular interest politically are the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.

=== International militaries ===
Militarily, the UN deploys peacekeeping forces, usually to build and maintain post-conflict peace and stability. When a more aggressive international military action is undertaken, either &quot;ad hoc&quot; coalitions (for example, the Multi-National Force – Iraq) or regional military alliances (for example, NATO) are used.

=== International monetary system ===
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were founded to foster global monetary cooperation and to fight poverty by financially assisting states in need. These institutions have been criticized as simply oligarchic hegemonies of the Great Powers, most notably the United States, which maintains the only veto, for instance, in the International Monetary Fund.

=== International trade ===
The World Trade Organization (WTO) sets the rules of international trade. It has a semi-legislative body (the General Council, reaching decisions by consensus) and a judicial body (the Dispute Settlement Body). Another influential economical international organization is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), with membership of 30 democratic members.

===Informal global influences===
In addition to the formal, or semi-formal, international organizations and laws mentioned above, many other mechanisms act to regulate human activities across national borders. International trade has the effect of requiring cooperation and interdependency between nations without a political body. Trans-national (or multi-national) corporations, some with resources exceeding those available to most governments, govern activities of people on a global scale. The rapid increase in the volume of trans-border digital communications and mass-media distribution (e.g., Internet, satellite television) has allowed information, ideas, and opinions to rapidly spread across the world, creating a complex web of international coordination and influence, mostly outside the control of any formal organizations or laws.

==Examples of regional integration of states==

There are a number of regional organizations that, while not supranational unions, have adopted or intend to adopt policies that may lead to a similar sort of integration in some respects. The European Union is generally recognized as the most integrated among these.

Other organisations that have also discussed greater integration include:
* Arab League into an &quot;Arab Union&quot;
* Caribbean Community (CARICOM) into a &quot;Caribbean Federation&quot;
* North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) into a &quot;North American Union&quot;
* Pacific Islands Forum into a &quot;Pacific Union&quot;

== In fiction ==
World government for Earth is frequently featured in fiction, particularly within the science fiction genre; well-known examples include the &quot;World State&quot; in Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot;, the &quot;Dictatorship of the Air&quot; in H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot;, the United Nations in James S. A Corey&#x27;s &quot;The Expanse&quot;, and United Earth (amongst other planetary sovereignties and even larger polities) in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. This concept also applies to other genres, while not as commonly, including well-known examples such as &quot;One Piece&quot;.

<text>Fehmarn (; ; from Old Wagrian Slavic &quot;&quot;Fe More&quot;, meaning &quot;In the Sea&quot;&quot;) is an island in the Baltic Sea, off the eastern coast of Germany&#x27;s northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein. It is Germany&#x27;s third-largest island, after Rügen and Usedom. Fehmarn is separated from the German peninsula of Wagria in Holstein by the Fehmarn Sound, and from the southern Danish island of Lolland by the Fehmarn Belt. It is connected to the Holsatian mainland by the Fehmarn Sound Bridge. The island belongs to the district of Ostholstein (East Holstein). The closest larger towns on the mainland are Heiligenhafen (&quot;Saints’ Harbor&quot;) and Oldenburg in Holstein (founded as &quot;Starigard&quot;). Right opposite Fehmarn, on the tip of the Wagrian Peninsula, is Großenbrode.

The Vogelfluglinie (Danish: Fugleflugtslinjen), an important transport corridor connecting the Danish capital of Copenhagen on the island of Zealand to the second-largest German city of Hamburg via Lübeck, runs across the island. There are currently two tunnels under construction in the region: the Fehmarn Belt Tunnel between Puttgarden on Fehmarn and Rødbyhavn on Lolland, and the Fehmarn Sound Tunnel between Strukkamp (Fehmarn) and Großenbrode (Wagria). The most notable settlements on Fehmarn are Burg auf Fehmarn (Low German: &quot;Borg op Fehmarn&quot;) and Puttgarden, with the island&#x27;s ferry port.

Fehmarn is allegorically represented by the &quot;Goldene Krone im blauen Meer&quot; (&quot;Golden Crown in the blue Sea&quot;), which can be seen on many flags on the island, making reference to the House of Oldenburg, the Danish royal house.

==History==

Earlier names of the island are Femera, Fimbria, Cimbria parva, and Imbra. As a part of Wagria, it was settled by the Slavic Lechitic tribe of Wagri in the Early Middle Ages. Fehmarn is one of the westernmost places of the former contiguous settlement area of the Slavs, and the westernmost island with a former Slavic settlement. The name of the island itself derives from the Polabian &quot;fe more&quot; (&quot;in the sea&quot;), modern &quot;v more&quot;, and has the same etymological background as Pomerania, deriving from &quot;po more&quot;, &quot;at the sea&quot;. Puttgarden is also a Slavic name, deriving from &quot;pod gard&quot;, which means &quot;under the castle&quot; (on Rügen exists a village with the same etymological background, evolving into the modern form Putgarten).

Other Slavic-founded villages on Fehmarn are Bannesdorf, Dänschendorf, Gahlendorf, Gammendorf-Siedendorf, Gollendorf, Hinrichsdorf, Klausdorf, Kopendorf, Lemkendorf, Meeschendorf, Püttsee, Sahrensdorf, Schlagsdorf, Sulsdorf and Vitzdorf. The villages of Bisdorf, Presen and Staberdorf are either Slavic-founded or founded by Germanic colonists from Holstein, Dithmarschen, Frisia, Lower Saxony and Denmark, who settled the island from around 1200 onwards. The Slavs inhabiting the island were gradually Christianized and Germanized.

From the Middle Ages till 1864 Fehmarn formed part of the Danish Duchy of Schleswig. When the duchy was partitioned in 1544, it formed part of the duchy of John the Elder. Upon his death without heirs in 1580, Fehmarn became part of the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp. After the Great Northern War, Fehmarn, along with the rest of Schleswig was united with the Danish crown. In 1864, Schleswig passed to Prussia as a result of the Second Schleswig War.

On 26 July 1932, the German Navy&#x27;s training ship &quot;Niobe&quot; sank off the island during a sudden squall, with the loss of 69 lives. At Gammendorfer Strand on Fehmarn, within view of the site of the sinking, the Niobe-Denkmal monument was erected.

Since 1963, Fehmarn has been connected to the German mainland by a road and rail bridge crossing the Fehmarn Sound Bridge. It is 963.40 m (3160.76 ft.) long and 69 m high.

==Geography==

The area is 185 km2 and the coastline is 78 km. The highest hills are the &quot;Hinrichsberg&quot; (27.2 m) and the &quot;Wulfener Berg&quot; (26.5 m). The largest community on Fehmarn is Burg () (lit. &quot;the Town of Fehmarn&quot;), with 6,000 inhabitants. In addition, there are many small villages, including Vadersdorf.

==Climate==

==Transport==
The Fehmarn Belt, a strait separating Fehmarn from Lolland, is located on the side opposite the German mainland. It can be crossed by ferries travelling between the seaports of Puttgarden, Germany, and Rødbyhavn, Denmark. The crossing takes about 45 minutes.

On 29 June 2007, the Danish and German authorities gave the go-ahead for the Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link tunnel project, planned for completion in 2028.

The aforementioned 963-metre (3,159 ft) long Fehmarn Sound Bridge connects the German island of Fehmarn with the German mainland near Großenbrode.

==Nature==
The coasts serve as resting places for migratory birds, and it is thus a popular location for ornithologists. The island&#x27;s bird reserves are looked after by NABU&#x27;s conservation centre at the Wallnau Waterbird Reserve. In Burg there is a large aquarium with 40 fish tanks.

Fehmarn is famous for its nature and recreation areas, especially during summertime (July–September) and is also well known for its windsurf and kitesurf spots. Currently there are more than ten surfspots known on the island.

==Culture==
Scharwenzel is a card game for two teams with two to four players on each team. The game is at least three centuries old and is played today only on Fehmarn.

Fehmarn was the location of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s final concert, at the Open Air Love &amp; Peace Festival, on 6 September 1970. The concert was held at Flügge Beach in the southwest. There is a memorial stone there and from 1995 through 2010, the Jimi-Hendrix-Revival-Festival was celebrated annually in September.

The St. Nicholas Church has a baptismal font that dates from 1391.

<doc id="99226" wikidata="Q1153938" url="?curid=99226" title="Point Pelee National Park">
<text>Point Pelee National Park (; ) is a national park in Essex County in southwestern Ontario, Canada where it extends into Lake Erie. The word is French for &#x27;bald&#x27;. Point Pelee consists of a peninsula of land, mainly of marsh and woodland habitats, that tapers to a sharp point as it extends into Lake Erie. Middle Island, also part of Point Pelee National Park, was acquired in 2000 and is just north of the Canada–United States border in Lake Erie. Point Pelee is the southernmost point of mainland Canada, and is located on a foundation of glacial sand, silt and gravel that bites into Lake Erie. This spit of land is slightly more than seven kilometres long by wide at its northern base. Established in 1918, Point Pelee was the first national park in Canada to be established for conservation. It was designated as a Ramsar site on 27 May 1987.

==History==

Aboriginal people lived on Point Pelee for many years before European colonization, dating back to at least 6,000 years. The largest archaeological site found at Point Pelee is thought to have been occupied between AD 700 and 900.

The name was given to the area by Fathers Dollier and Galinée when they passed through the area in 1670.

In the late 1700s, British naval reserves logged the area&#x27;s white pine for shipbuilding. In 1790, Deputy Indian Agent Alexander McKee negotiated a treaty with Aboriginal communities that ceded a large tract of land, which included Point Pelee, to the Crown. The Caldwell First Nation Chippewa people, who inhabited Point Pelee, were not signatories of that treaty. However, the Crown did not realize this, and their land was ceded nonetheless. Subsequently, they were forced off their land, and Point Pelee remains unceded Aboriginal land. This has been publicly acknowledged by the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada.

Prior to the creation of the park, the Great Lakes Ornithological Club was established to study bird migration. One of the members, Percy A. Taverner, and Canada&#x27;s first Dominion Ornithologist, recommended Point Pelee be made a national park in 1915. Jack Miner had also pushed for the creation of the park by that time. Point Pelee was made a national park in 1918 at the urging of birdwatchers and hunters. Commercial fishing continued in the park until 1969. Point Pelee was the only Canadian national park to allow hunting until duck hunting was ended in 1989. This site was named &quot;Pointe-Pelée&quot; (meaning &quot;bald point&quot;) by French explorers because the eastern side was rocky and had no trees.

Point Pelee was designated a dark-sky preserve in 2006, the first Canadian national park to be designated as such. In March 2006, high winds caused waves that washed away the sand point and all that remained was a platform. In October 2007 the level of Lake Erie dropped enough to reveal the point again extending at least a kilometre out into the water and at least wide with a winding curve shape to it. Since that time the sandy tip continues to shift, grow longer or shorter, or even detach temporarily, from year to year.

==Geography==

Located in the western parts of the St. Lawrence Lowlands, the park is a sandspit formation that extends into Lake Erie and is up to thick. With an area of only , it is Canada&#x27;s smallest national park. Most of the park (about or 70% of the park consists of marsh, dominated by cattails and ponds although forested areas make up a significant portion of the park, covering about 21% of the park. This sandspit is dominated by till plains which were formed during the last ice age during the advance and retreat of the Wisconsonian ice on a submerged limestone ridge. As the glacier melted and retreated northward, the Lake Erie basin began to fill with water. The movement of sediments altered the coastline, resulting in the present-day shape of Point Pelee. Subsequently, over the centuries, a thin but rich soil has formed. Mineral soils in the park were mapped as well to rapidly drained Eastport sand, which has insignificant profile development. The marshes began to form about 3,200 years ago, based on carbon dating. This was also the same time when the sands began to deposit, forming the present day barriers. The marsh has a closed drainage system owing to the separation of it by two barriers along the east and west side, which usually prevents the free exchange of water. However, when lake levels are higher, the marsh water levels fluctuate with the lake&#x27;s water levels. The distinctive triangular shape at the southern tip of Point Pelee is caused by the convergence of these two barriers (this spit or tip is the southernmost point of the Canadian mainland). Middle Island, which is located south of the Point Pelee peninsula has an area of approximately and is the southernmost point in Canada. Virtually all of Middle Island is forested.

===Flora and fauna===

Owing to its southernly location and the moderating effects of Lake Erie, the climate in the park is slightly warmer than the rest of Canada and many Carolinian faunal species, which are rare in Canada are located here. Examples include the fox snake and the five-lined skink. Because of its location at the crossroads of two major migration flyways, about 347–360 different species of migratory birds have been recorded in the park and more than 100 species stay there for breeding. This total includes 102 waterfowl and shorebird species. Dominic Couzen&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Birding Sites of the World&quot; lists Point Pelee as #66. Coyotes are also present within this park. Many Carolinian floral species that are rare in Canada occur within the park boundaries. Point Pelee has six different habitats: beach, cedar, savanna, dry forest, wet forest, and freshwater marsh. The park contains more than 750 native plant species, of these 8 species are considered to be rare, endangered or threatened in Canada. Nearby Point Pelee is Middle Island which is designated provincially as an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest (ANSI) due to its unique and rare assemblages of plants and animals. Middle Island is home to plants and animals that are characteristic of the Carolinian ecozone of which nine species are at risk. The diversity of vegetation in the marsh is the highest along the edge of the marsh ponds and in the transitional zones between the terrestrial environments and the marsh. Four different vegetation communities dominate in the marsh.

==Climate==
Point Pelee has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot; under the Köppen climate classification) with warm, humid summers, and cold winters that is modified by the surrounding waters of Lake Erie. It lies in a zone that is characterized by variable weather due to conflict between polar and tropical air masses.
Its position in Lake Erie modifies its climate, resulting in warmer winter and fall temperatures compared to inland regions, as the lake cools more slowly than the surrounding land though during the spring, temperatures remain cooler than inland areas due to the land warming faster than the lake.

Winters are cold with a January average temperature of . Owing to its position in Lake Erie, winter temperatures are warmer than inland locations at a similar latitude due to the release of the heat stored by the lake. As a result, temperatures below are rare, with only 1.9 days where the temperature reaches or falls below . The maximum temperature usually stays below freezing on most days although mild spells of weather can occur time to time. The park receives of snowfall per year and there are 30.6 days with measurable snow. The park is not located in the snowbelt region, and snow cover is intermittent through the winter.

Summers are warm and humid with the warmest month, July, averaging , which is among the highest in Ontario. The surrounding lake moderates summertime temperatures, cooling the flow of warm air masses originating from the Gulf of Mexico and as a result, temperatures above are rare, with only 4–8 days per year in the park.

==Human impact==

===Development===
From a regional perspective, the park is isolated from other natural areas because in Essex County, less than 6% of the native forest cover and 3% of the wetlands remain intact. Much of the area (97% of it) has been altered and mostly converted for agriculture, industry or urban development. It is also located relatively close to the major urban area of Windsor-Detroit.

==Birdwatching==
The park forms the southernmost point in mainland Canada (its latitude is the same as that of Rome, Italy and Barcelona, Spain) and is part of a bird and butterfly migration corridor over Lake Erie via Point Pelee and the Lake Erie islands. Over 360 bird species have been recorded in the park. The peak time for bird migration is spring, especially May, when tired migrants make first landfall after their journey north across the lake.

Many birdwatchers from North America and abroad visit the park in May, often staying in the nearby town of Leamington. One attraction, apart from the sheer numbers and variety of birds passing through on migration, is the opportunity to see more northerly breeding species before they move on. It is widely recognized as one of the most desirable destinations for avid birdwatchers, particularly for the migration of Passerines.

==Occurrences==

===March 2017 marsh fire===
On 29 March 2017, Point Pelee&#x27;s marsh land was involved in a fire that burned over of marsh habitat. The fire lasted 15 hours and was naturally extinguished due to rainfall the following day.

===Commemoration===
Point Pelee National Park was featured on a high-value ($5) postage stamp, issued in 1983, as part of a series honouring national parks. The park appeared on a stamp that was issued on 15 January 2018, with a $1.20 face value. The issue coincides with the park&#x27;s centennial year, and is part of a nine-stamp set featuring scenic views across the country.

<doc id="99227" wikidata="Q180311" url="?curid=99227" title="Iranian calendars">
<text>The Iranian calendar or Iranian chronology (, ) are a succession of calendars created and used for over two millennia in Iran, also known as Persia. One of the longest chronological records in human history, the Iranian calendar has been modified many times for administrative purposes. The most influential person in laying the frameworks for the calendar and its precision was the 11th century Persian polymath, Omar Khayyam. The modern Iranian calendar is currently the official civil calendar in Iran. 

The Iranian New Year begins at the midnight nearest to the instant of the northern spring equinox, as determined by astronomic calculations for the meridian (52.5°E). It is, therefore, an observation-based calendar, unlike the Gregorian, which is rule-based. This equinox occurs on or about 20 March of the Gregorian calendar. The time zone of Iran is Iran Standard Time, UTC+03:30.

== Ancient calendars ==
The earliest evidence of Iranian calendrical traditions is from the second millennium BC and possibly even predates the appearance of the Iranian prophet Zoroaster. The first fully preserved calendar is that of the Achaemenids, a royal dynasty of the 5th century BC who gave rise to Zoroastrianism. Throughout recorded history, Persians have been keen on the idea and importance of having a calendar. They were among the first cultures to use a solar calendar and have long favoured a solar over lunar and lunisolar approaches. The sun has always been a religious and divine symbol in Iranian culture and is the origin of the folklore regarding Cyrus the Great.

=== Old Persian calendar ===
Old Persian inscriptions and tablets indicate that early Iranians used a 360-day calendar based on the solar observation directly and modified for their beliefs. Days were not named. The months had two or three divisions depending on the phase of the moon. Twelve months of 30 days were named for festivals or activities of the pastoral year. An intercalation month was added periodically to keep the calendar synchronized with the seasons.

The following table lists the Old Persian months, alongside the approximate Gregorian months and approximate Babylonian lunar months.
There were four farming festivals, symmetric about &quot;maidyoshahem&quot;:

Two more festivals were later added, creating the six &quot;gahanbar&quot;:

===Zoroastrian calendar===
The first calendars based on Zoroastrian cosmology appeared in the later Achaemenid period (650 to 330 BC). They evolved over the centuries, but month names changed little until now.

The unified Achaemenid Empire required a distinctive Iranian calendar, and one was devised in Egyptian tradition, with 12 months of 30 days, each dedicated to a yazata (Eyzad), and four divisions resembling the Semitic week. Four days per month were dedicated to Ahura Mazda and seven were named after the six Amesha Spentas. Thirteen days were named after Fire, Water, Sun, Moon, Tiri and Geush Urvan (the soul of all animals), Mithra, Sraosha (Soroush, yazata of prayer), Rashnu (the Judge), Fravashi, Bahram (yazata of victory), Raman (Ramesh meaning peace), and Vata, the divinity of the wind. Three were dedicated to the female divinities, Daena (yazata of religion and personified conscious), Ashi (yazata of fortune) and Arshtat (justice). The remaining four were dedicated to Asman (lord of sky or Heaven), Zam (earth), Manthra Spenta (the Bounteous Sacred Word) and Anaghra Raocha (the &#x27;Endless Light&#x27; of paradise).

The month names and their modern versions are given in the following table.

The calendar had a significant impact on religious observance. It fixed the pantheon of major divinities, and also ensured that their names were uttered often, since at every Zoroastrian act of worship the yazatas of both day and month were invoked. It also clarified the pattern of festivities; for example, Mitrakanna or Mehregan was celebrated on Mithra day of Mithra month, and the Tiri festival (Tiragan) was celebrated on Tiri day of the Tiri month.

In 538 BC Cyrus the Great (uncertain if he was a Zoroastrian) conquered Babylon and the Babylonian luni-solar calendar came into use for civil purposes. Cambyses conquered Egypt in 525 BC. He was accompanied by Darius, a Zoroastrian who became ruler of the Persian empire in 517 BC. The Zoroastrians adopted the wandering Egyptian solar calendar of twelve months of thirty days plus five epagomenal days. As their year began in the spring (with the festival of &quot;norouz&quot;) the &quot;epagomenai&quot; were placed just before &quot;norouz&quot;.

In Egypt the star Sirius had significance since every 1460 years (the Sothic cycle) its heliacal rising (just before sunrise) marked the Egyptian new year and the inundation of the Nile. In Persia also the star had significance, since its heliacal rising there also coincided with the coming of the rain. The fourth Persian month was &quot;Tishtrya&quot; (Sirius, rain star). The vernal equinox at Greenwich fell on the first day of the first month from 487 to 483 BC (inclusive). Adopting S H Taqizadeh&#x27;s date of 28 March 487 BC for the reform the calendar for that year is as follows:

The fourth month includes 20 July, the date of the heliacal rising of Sirius. In the first year the people carried on using the old calendar, anticipating festival dates by five days. As each day is named after a god, it is important to observe the celebrations on the right day. Thus the &quot;fravasis&quot; festival, which in the old calendar was kept between sunset on 30 Spandarmad and sunrise on 1 Frawardin, was now observed throughout the &quot;epagomenai&quot;. In the second year of the reform, the old 30 Spandarmad was the new 25 Spandarmad, so from then on the festival covered eleven days, up to the new 1 Frawardin. Five days was considered enough for other festivals, however.

In all the lands where the Persian calendar was used the &quot;epagomenai&quot; were placed at the end of the year. To offset the difference between the agricultural year and the calendar year (the tax-gathering season began after the harvest) the start of the &quot;araji&quot; (land-tax) year was delayed by one month every 120 years. A Roman historian, Quintus Curtius Rufus, describing a ceremony in 333 BC, writes:

The magi were followed by three hundred and sixty-five young men clad in purple robes, equal in number to the days of a whole year; for the Persians also divided the year into that number of days.

After the conquests by Alexander the Great and his death, the Persian territories fell to one of his generals, Seleucus (312 BC), starting the Seleucid dynasty of Iran. Based on the Greek tradition, Seleucids introduced the practice of dating by era rather than by the reign of individual kings. Their era became known as that of Alexander, or later the Seleucid era. Since the new rulers were not Zoroastrians, Zoroastrian priests lost their function at the royal courts, and so resented the Seleucids. Although they began dating by eras, they established their own era of Zoroaster.

That was the first serious attempt to determine the dates associated with the prophet Zoroaster&#x27;s life. Priests had no Zoroastrian historical sources, and so turned to Babylonian archives famous in the ancient world. From these they learned that a great event in Persian history took place 228 years before the era of Alexander. In fact, this was the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus the Great in 539 BC. But the priests misinterpreted this date to be the time the &quot;true faith&quot; was revealed to their prophet, and since Avestan literature indicates that revelation happened when Zoroaster was 30 years old, 568 BC was taken as his year of birth. The date entered written records as the beginning of the era of Zoroaster, and indeed, the Persian Empire. This incorrect date is still mentioned in many current encyclopedias as Zoroaster&#x27;s birth date.

=== Modifications by Parthians, Ardashir I, Hormizd I, Yazdgerd III ===
The Parthians (Arsacid dynasty) adopted the same calendar system with minor modifications, and dated their era from 248 BC, the date they succeeded the Seleucids. Their names for the months and days are Parthian equivalents of the Avestan ones used previously, differing slightly from the Middle Persian names used by the Sassanians. For example, in Achaemenid times the modern Persian month &#x27;Day&#x27; was called Dadvah (Creator), in Parthian it was Datush and the Sassanians named it Dadv/Dai (Dadar in Pahlavi).

When in April of AD 224 the Parthian dynasty fell and was replaced by the Sasanid, the new king, Ardashir I, abolished the official Babylonian calendar and replaced it with the Zoroastrian. This involved a correction to the places of the &quot;gahanbar&quot;, which had slipped back in the seasons since they were fixed. These were placed eight months later, as were the &quot;epagomenai&quot;, the &#x27;Gatha&#x27; or &#x27;Gah&#x27; days after the ancient Zoroastrian hymns of the same name. Other countries, such as the Armenians and Choresmians, did not accept the change. The new dates were:

In AD 224 the vernal equinox at Greenwich fell at noon on 21 March, which was 22 Shahrewar. Immediately after the reform 21 March corresponded to 27 Shahrewar. Here is the calendar for AD 225–6:

The change caused confusion and was immensely unpopular. The new &quot;epagomenai&quot; were referred to as &quot;robber days&quot;. The people now observed the &quot;Great&quot; &quot;nowruz&quot; on 6 Frawardin, which was Zoroaster&#x27;s birthday and corresponded to 1 Frawardin in the old calendar. The new 1 Frawardin was observed as the &quot;lesser&quot; &quot;nowruz&quot;. Hormizd I (AD 272–273) made the intervening days into festivals as well. In AD 273, the vernal equinox at 0° fell at 05:00 UTC on 21 March.

Yazdegerd I reigned from AD 399–420. In AD 400 the equinox fell about 19 March, which was 9 Aban. According to al-Biruni, in that reign there was a double adjustment of the start of the &quot;araji&quot; year. The tenth-century astronomer Abu&#x27;l-asan Kusyar noted that during the reign of Osrow II (AD 589–628) the sun entered Aries in Adur. This happened throughout his reign. An &quot;araji&quot; era was introduced dating from AD 621, and the Yazdegerdi era dates from 16 June AD 632, so the Yazdegerdi era is eleven years behind the &quot;araji&quot;.

==Muslim conquest==

The Muslim rulers who took over from the middle of the seventh century used the Islamic calendar for administration, which caused hardship because the year was shorter – i.e. a tax which was formerly collected after the harvest would now have to be paid before the harvest. Traditionally it is said that the Caliph Omar reintroduced the Persian calendar for tax collection purposes.

In AD 895 there was another double readjustment of the start of the &quot;araji&quot; year. It moved from 1 Frawardin (12 April) to 1 Khordad (11 June). By AD 1006 the vernal equinox, 15 March, was again coinciding with &quot;nowruz&quot;, 1 Frawardin. In that year, therefore, the &quot;epagomenai&quot; were delayed four months, moving from the end of Aban to their old position at the end of Spandarmad. This is the calendar for AD 1006/7:

The &quot;gahanbar&quot; did not move quite to their old places, because the fifth moved to 20 Day, which was the old 15 Day, thus increasing the interval between the fourth and fifth to eighty days and reducing the interval between the fifth and sixth to 75 days. The new dates were:

==Medieval era: Jalali calendar==
In AD 1079, by the order of the Jalal Al-Din Shah Seljuqi, the Islamic Calendar (which was and is based on the lunar system) was replaced in Persia by the calendar of Omar Khayyam and was called the Jalali Calendar. Khayyam and his team had worked 8 years in Isfahan, the capital of Iran during the Seljuq dynasty. The research and creation of the Khayyam calendar was financially supported by Jalal Al din Shah. Khayyam designed his calendar in which the beginning of the new year, season and month are aligned and he named the first day of the spring and the new year to be Norooz (also spelled Nowruz). Before Khayyam&#x27;s calendar, Norooz was not a fixed day and each year could fall in late winter or early spring.

From 15 March 1079, when the calendar had slipped a further eighteen days, the &quot;araji&quot; calendar was reformed by repeating the first eighteen days of Frawardin. Thus 14 March was 18 Frawardin &quot;qadimi&quot; (old) or &quot;farsi&quot; (Persian) and 15 March was 1 Frawardin &quot;jalali&quot; or &quot;maleki&quot; (royal). This new calendar was astronomically calculated, so that it did not have &quot;epagemonai&quot; – the months began when the sun entered a new sign of the zodiac.

About 120 years after the reform of AD 1006, when the vernal equinox was starting to fall in Ardawahisht, Zoroastrians made it again coincide with &quot;nowruz&quot; by adding a second Spandarmad. This &quot;Shensai&quot; calendar was a month behind the &quot;qadimi&quot; still used in Persia, being used only by the Zoroastrians in India, the Parsees. On 6 June 1745 (Old Style) some Parsees re-adopted the &quot;qadimi&quot; calendar, and in 1906 some adopted the &quot;Fasli&quot; calendar in which 1 Frawardin was equated with 21 March, so that there was a sixth epagomenal day every four years. In 1911 the &quot;jalali&quot; calendar became the official national calendar of Persia. Some Zoroastrians in Persia now use the &quot;Fasli&quot; calendar, having begun changing to it in 1930.

== Modern calendar: Solar Hijri (SH) ==

The present Iranian calendar was legally adopted on 31 March 1925, under the early Pahlavi dynasty. The law said that the first day of the year should be the first day of spring in &quot;the true solar year&quot;, &quot;as it has been&quot; ever so. It also fixed the number of days in each month, which previously varied by year with the sidereal zodiac. It revived the ancient Persian names, which are still used. 1 Farvardin is the day whose midnight start is nearest to the instant of vernal equinox. The first six months have 31 days, the next five thirty, and the twelfth has 29 days and 30 in leap years. 

It specified the origin of the calendar to be the Hijrah of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina in AD 622. It also deprecated the 12-year cycles of the Chinese-Uighur calendar which were not officially sanctioned but were commonly used.

On March 10, 1976 (20 Esfand 1354), Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi introduced the &quot;Imperial calendar&quot; that measured the first year from 559 BC, the beginning of Cyrus the Great&#x27;s reign and the foundation of the Achaemenian Empire, rather than 622 AD, the Hijra of Muhammad. Overnight, the year changed from 1355 to 2535. This change was reversed slightly more than two years later, on September 2, 1978 (11 Shahrivar 2537, which became 11 Shahrivar 1357), in the wake of civil unrest preceding the Iranian revolution, and the calendar reverted to Solar Hijri.

<text>The Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) was a reconnaissance and raiding unit of the British Army during the Second World War.

Originally called the Long Range Patrol (LRP), the unit was founded in Egypt in June 1940 by Major Ralph Alger Bagnold, acting under the direction of General Archibald Wavell. Bagnold was assisted by Captain Patrick Clayton and Captain William Shaw. The majority of the men were from New Zealand, but they were soon joined by a few Southern Rhodesian and British volunteers, whereupon new sub-units were formed and the name was changed to the better-known Long Range Desert Group (LRDG). The LRDG never numbered more than 350 men, all of whom were volunteers.

The LRDG was formed specifically to carry out deep penetration, covert reconnaissance patrols and intelligence missions from behind Italian lines, although they sometimes engaged in combat operations. Because the LRDG were experts in desert navigation, they were sometimes assigned to guide other units, including the Special Air Service and secret agents across the desert. During the Desert Campaign between December 1940 and April 1943, the vehicles of the LRDG operated constantly behind the Axis lines, missing a total of only 15 days during the entire period. Possibly their most notable offensive action was during Operation Caravan, an attack on the town of Barce and its associated airfield, on the night of 13 September 1942. However, their most vital role was the &#x27;Road Watch&#x27;, during which they clandestinely monitored traffic on the main road from Tripoli to Benghazi, transmitting the intelligence to British Army Headquarters.

With the surrender of the Axis forces in Tunisia in May 1943, the LRDG changed roles and moved operations to the eastern Mediterranean, carrying out missions in the Greek islands, Italy and the Balkans. After the end of the war in Europe, the leaders of the LRDG made a request to the War Office for the unit to be transferred to the Far East to conduct operations against the Japanese Empire. The request was declined and the LRDG was disbanded in August 1945.

==Formation==
Before the war, Major Ralph Bagnold learned how to maintain and operate vehicles, how to navigate, and how to communicate in the desert. On 23 June 1940 he met General Archibald Wavell, the commander of Middle East Command in Alexandria and explained his concept for a group of men intended to undertake long-range reconnaissance patrols to gather intelligence behind the Italian lines in Libya.
General Wavell was familiar with desert warfare, having been a liaison officer with the Egyptian Expeditionary Force during the First World War, and he understood and endorsed Bagnold&#x27;s suggested concept. Wavell assisted in equipping the force.

The unit, initially known as the &quot;No.1 Long Range Patrol Unit&quot; (LRP), was founded on 3 July 1940. Bagnold wanted men who were energetic, innovative, self-reliant, physically and mentally tough, and able to live and fight in seclusion in the Libyan desert. Bagnold felt that New Zealand farmers would possess these attributes and was given permission to approach the 2nd New Zealand Division for volunteers; over half the division volunteered. Two officers and 85 other ranks including 18 administrative and technical personnel were eventually selected, coming mostly from the Divisional Cavalry Regiment and the 27th Machine-Gun Battalion. Once the men had been recruited, they started training in desert survival techniques and desert driving and navigation, with additional training in radio communications and demolitions.

The LRP could initially form only three units, known as patrols, but a doubling of strength allowed the addition of a new Heavy Section. In November 1940, the name of the LRP was changed to the &quot;Long Range Desert Group&quot; (LRDG), and the New Zealanders were joined by volunteers from British and Southern Rhodesian regiments. The British volunteers, who came mostly from the Brigade of Guards and Yeomanry regiments, were incorporated into their own patrols. The original patrol unit consisted of two officers and 28 other ranks, equipped with a Canadian Military Pattern (CMP) Ford 15 Imperial hundredweight (cwt) truck and ten Chevrolet 30 cwt trucks. In March 1941 new types of trucks were issued and the patrol units were split into half-patrols of one officer and 15–18 men in five or six vehicles. Each patrol incorporated a medical orderly, a navigator, a radio operator and a vehicle mechanic, each of whom manned a truck equipped for their role.

==Patrols==

The Long Range Patrol comprised a 15-man headquarters with Bagnold in command. There were three sub-units: &#x27;R&#x27; Patrol commanded by Captain Donald Gavin Steele, &#x27;T&#x27; Patrol commanded by Captain Patrick Clayton and &#x27;W&#x27; Patrol commanded by Captain Edward &#x27;Teddy&#x27; Cecil Mitford. &#x27;T&#x27; and &#x27;W&#x27; Patrols were combat units while &#x27;R&#x27; Patrol was intended to be a support unit.

In November 1940, the LRP was reorganised and re-designated as the Long Range Desert Group. It was expanded to six Patrols: &#x27;T&#x27;, &#x27;W&#x27; and &#x27;R&#x27; Patrols were joined by &#x27;G&#x27;, &#x27;S&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; Patrols. Each patrol was expected to belong to the same regimental group, but only the Brigade of Guards and the Yeomanry regiments formed their own Patrols, &#x27;G&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; respectively. The men of &#x27;G&#x27; Patrol were drawn from the 3rd Battalion Coldstream Guards and the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards under command of Captain Michael Crichton-Stuart. The &#x27;Y&#x27; Patrol men were drawn from the Nottinghamshire Yeomanry under command of Captain P. J. D. McCraith, with additional men from the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. In December 1940, &#x27;W&#x27; Patrol was disbanded and its personnel used to bring &#x27;R&#x27; and &#x27;T&#x27; Patrols up to strength, while &#x27;G&#x27; Patrol took over their vehicles. By June 1941 the LRDG was re-organised into two squadrons: the New Zealand and Rhodesian &#x27;A&#x27; Squadron with &#x27;S&#x27;, &#x27;T&#x27; and &#x27;R&#x27; Patrols, and &#x27;B&#x27; Squadron with &#x27;G&#x27;, &#x27;H&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; Patrols. There was also a Headquarters Section along with signals, survey and light repair sections. A Heavy section, initially equipped with four 6-ton Marmon-Herrington trucks, was used to provide logistical support by transporting supplies to bases and setting up hidden replenishment points at pre-arranged locations. In addition, there was an Air Section of two biplanes, a Waco ZGC-7 and a Waco YKC, that transported key personnel, evacuated wounded and performed other liaison tasks.

In August 1941 an artillery unit was formed to attack Italian forts more effectively. Initially it used a QF 4.5-inch howitzer carried on a 10-ton Mack NR 4 truck, with an accompanying light tank as an armoured observation post. However, these were handed over to the Free French at Kufra. The unit was then issued a 25-pounder gun-howitzer portee. The LRDG successfully attacked and captured the fort at El Gtafia using the gun, but later the truck had to be abandoned and the experiment ended.

In October 1941 the LRDG was expanded to 10 patrols by the simple method of splitting the existing patrols into two-half patrols; the New Zealanders formed A Squadron comprising &#x27;R1&#x27;, &#x27;R2&#x27;, &#x27;T1&#x27;, and &#x27;T2&#x27; Patrols and the British and Rhodesians formed B Squadron comprising &#x27;G1&#x27;, &#x27;G2&#x27;, &#x27;S1&#x27;, &#x27;S2&#x27;, &#x27;Y1&#x27;, and &#x27;Y2&#x27; Patrols. The &#x27;H&#x27; Patrol had been disbanded in September 1941 after three months service.

These two squadrons were joined in December 1941 by the Indian Long Range Squadron, which had been formed by volunteers from the 2nd Lancers, 11th Cavalry and the 18th Cavalry, all part of the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade. The Indian Squadron was organized along ethnic and religious lines with the first two patrols originally known as &#x27;J&#x27; (Jats) and &#x27;R&#x27; (Rajput) Patrols. Their designations were changed to &#x27;I1&#x27; and &#x27;I2&#x27; to avoid confusion. In October 1942 two further Indian patrols were formed: &#x27;M&#x27; (Muslim) and &#x27;S&#x27; (Sikh) Patrols, which became the &#x27;I3&#x27; and &#x27;I4&#x27; Patrols. No. 1 Demolition Squadron, nicknamed &quot;Popski&#x27;s Private Army&quot; and commanded by Major Vladimir &#x27;Popski&#x27; Peniakoff, was briefly attached to the LRDG beginning in December 1942.
The vehicles of each patrol adopted their own markings. The New Zealand &#x27;R&#x27; Patrol used a green Hei-tiki with a red tongue painted on the right side of the bonnet of the vehicle, and on the left a Māori place name beginning with the letter &#x27;R&#x27; (for example, &#x27;Rotowaro&#x27;). The &#x27;T&#x27; Patrol vehicles had a black Kiwi over green &#x27;grass&#x27; and a Māori name starting with &#x27;Te&#x27; (for example, &#x27;Te Anau&#x27;) in the corresponding places. The &#x27;W&#x27; Patrol vehicles had a Māori name or word starting with &#x27;W&#x27; painted on their vehicles.

The British &#x27;G&#x27; Patrol vehicles carried no distinctive markings, although some vehicles had the Guards insignia. They took over &#x27;W&#x27; Patrol&#x27;s vehicles when that unit was disbanded. The &#x27;Y&#x27; Patrol vehicles were slightly different; &#x27;Y1&#x27; half-patrol vehicles all had names of famous drinking establishments (such as &#x27;Cock O&#x27; The North&#x27;) and &#x27;Y2&#x27; half-patrol had names from the &quot;Three Musketeers&quot; books (for example, &#x27;Aramis&#x27;) on the left sides of their vehicle bonnets. The Headquarters Section used a sequence of letters arranged in a square (see photo of &quot;Louise&quot;). The Rhodesian &#x27;S&#x27; Patrol vehicles had names with a Rhodesian connection (such as &#x27;Salisbury&#x27;) painted on the left side of the vehicles&#x27; bonnets. By 1943 the practice of naming replacement vehicles was dropped.

==Equipment==

===Vehicles===

The LRDG vehicles were mainly two wheel drive, chosen because they were lighter and used less fuel than four wheel drive. They were stripped of all non-essentials, including doors, windscreens and roofs. They were fitted with a bigger radiator, a condenser system, built up leaf springs for the harsh terrain, wide, low pressure desert tyres, sand mats and channels, plus map containers and a sun compass devised by Bagnold. Wireless trucks had special compartments built into the bodywork to house wireless equipment. Initially the LRDG patrols were equipped with one Canadian Military Pattern (CMP) Ford 15 cwt F15 truck for the commander, while the rest of the patrol used up to 10 Chevrolet 30 cwt 158.5&quot; wheelbase (WB) trucks (the &#x27;WA&#x27; model mentioned in some texts appears to be an 133&quot; wheelbase version of the same vehicle). From March 1941 the 30 cwt Chevrolets were replaced by the CMP Ford 30 cwt F30, although in some ways this was a retrograde step as the four wheel drive and extra weight compared to the Chevrolets meant they used twice as much fuel, which reduced the range of a patrol. From March 1942 the Fords were progressively replaced by 200 Canadian Chevrolet 1533 X2 30 cwts, which had been specially ordered for the LRDG. From July 1942 Willys jeeps began to be issued for the patrol commander and patrol sergeant.

General Order 297 of November 22, 1940 specified that all vehicles in the Middle East were to be painted with a common basic colour of Light Stone, ie the BSC (British Standard Colour) number 61, which is a medium toned yellow with a brown tinge which veterans refer to as desert yellow. To achieve the Caunter camouflage scheme, two contrasting colours may be applied along with this basic colour, these being Silver Grey BSC number 28 a greyish pastel green, and Slate BSC number 34. All three colours were specified in &quot;BSC 381:C 1930 Colours for Ready Mixed Paints&quot;.

===Weapons===

The patrol vehicles were initially armed with 11 Lewis machine guns, four Boys anti-tank rifles and a Bofors 37 mm anti-tank gun distributed amongst their vehicles. By December 1940, the vehicle armaments had been improved and &#x27;T&#x27; Patrol, for example, had five .303 Vickers Medium Mk. I machine guns, five Lewis guns, four Boys anti-tank guns and the Bofors 37 mm. Another Vickers gun used was the heavy Vickers .50 machine gun, which would be mounted at the rear of the vehicle. All of the unit&#x27;s vehicles were armed with at least one gun; each vehicle was fitted with six to eight gun mountings, but normally only two or three of them would be in use.
Supplementing their army-supplied weapons, the LRDG was equipped with surplus Royal Air Force (RAF) aircraft guns, which were acquired for their high rate of fire. The most widely used of these was the Vickers K machine gun, which was sometimes used mounted in pairs. From mid-1941 the LRDG acquired .303 Browning Mk II&#x27;s from RAF stocks, also mounted in pairs, with a combined rate of fire of 2,400 rounds per minute. When new vehicles were issued in March 1942, several were converted to carry captured dual-purpose 20 mm Breda Model 35s, which replaced the Bofors 37 mm, and each half-patrol was equipped with one Breda &quot;Gun truck&quot;. In September 1942 the .50 Browning AN/M2 heavy machine gun began to replace both calibres of the Vickers machine guns and the Boys anti-tank rifle.

The men of the LRDG carried the standard British Second World War small arms, the Lee–Enfield No.1 Mk III* being the primary rifle. Other small arms carried were Thompson submachine guns and .38 Enfield, Webley &amp; Scott or .45 Colt 1911A1 pistols. Several types of hand grenade were used: the Mills bomb, the No. 68 Anti-tank and the No. 69. Each truck was outfitted with a Lee–Enfield EY rifle attachment with a discharger cup able to fire the No. 36M Mills rifle grenade. The LRDG also laid land mines, the most common being the Mk 2 mine. Other explosives included the Lewes bombs, a custom made weapon using Nobel 808 used to destroy aircraft and other targets, and sticky bombs used to destroy enemy vehicles.

Captured German and Italian small arms were utilised including the Beretta M 1934, Luger P08 and Walther P38 pistols. The German MP40 submachine gun and MG34, MG42 along with Italian Breda M37 and Breda M38 machine guns were all used.

===Communications===
In the LRP, most of the radio operators were New Zealanders, but the LRDG radio operators were all from the Royal Corps of Signals. These men were skilled in communications and were able to maintain and repair their equipment without any outside help. On only three occasions did a broken radio prevent a patrol communicating with its headquarters. All LRDG patrols included one vehicle equipped with a Wireless Set No. 11 and a non-military Philips model 635 receiver. The No. 11 Set had been designed for use in tanks, and had transmitter and receiver circuits; the Royal Signals expected to use the No. 11 set to transmit and receive between and with the use of or antennas.
The LRDG used Morse code for all transmissions, and were able to transmit over great distances using either a dipole antenna system attached to a rod antenna mounted on the truck, which was adequate up to , or for greater distances, a Windom dipole system slung between two tall poles. The disadvantage of using the Windom system was that it took time to erect and work out the correct antenna length, so it could only be used in a relatively safe area. To power the No. 11 set extra batteries had to be carried by the radio vehicles.
The Philips receiver was used to monitor Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) time checks, which was vital for desert navigation.

While on the move the lead vehicles of the patrol commanders and sergeants flew a small flag. Because the LRP was organised on divisional cavalry lines the leaders carried green flags for &#x27;A&#x27; (HQ) Troop, black for &#x27;B&#x27; Troop, yellow for &#x27;C&#x27; Troop and red for &#x27;D&#x27;. When the LRDG was organised into 11 vehicle patrols this was simplified to a green flag displaying the patrol letter in white; the later half-patrols used a plain green flag on occasion. When it became necessary to change course from an intended route, or in the event of enemy action, patrol movements were controlled by a simple semaphore flag system using blue and white signal flags, or hand signals, depending on how widely dispersed the trucks were.

===Navigation===
All trucks of the LRDG were equipped with the Bagnold sun compass and some trucks were also equipped with a P8 Tank Compass. Each patrol had a navigator who always rode in the second truck in the formation. He was equipped with a theodolite and astronomical position tables with which to plot star sightings, and maps. Watches were used and adjusted each evening using the GMT time check. One major problem faced early on by the LRDG was a lack of accurate maps for Libya in particular. Patrols had to do their own surveys and make their own maps of each route they took. In July 1941 the Survey Section was formed to carry out this task.

==History==
The LRDG area of operations between 1940 and 1943, known as the Western Desert, stretched about south from the Mediterranean to the Tibesti and the Jebel Uweinat mountains, and about from the Nile valley in the east to the mountains of Tunisia and Algeria in the west. Paved roads were non-existent and only small tracks and pathways crossed the area. The daytime temperatures could reach and at night drop below freezing. The only water in the area is found in a number of small oases, which is also where the only vegetation grows. While the vast majority of Eighth Army operated along the coast, the LRDG started operations inland south of the Great Sand Sea, were later based there and operated west and north, and were later based further west, well south of the coast.

The first LRP patrol began during the Italian invasion of Egypt. &#x27;W&#x27; Patrol commanded by Captain Mitford set out on 15 September 1940 to carry out a reconnaissance of Kufra and Uweinat. Finding no trace of the Italians, they turned south and attacked fuel dumps, aircraft and an Italian convoy carrying supplies to Kufra. &#x27;T&#x27; Patrol, commanded by Captain Clayton, reconnoitred the main route between Kufra and Uweinat, then drove south to meet up with &#x27;W&#x27; Patrol; both units returned to base, having captured two Italian trucks and official mail. The Italian response to these raids was to reduce their front line forces and increase the number of troops garrisoning the area from 2,900 men in September to 5,500 by November 1940.
On 27 December 1940, &#x27;G&#x27; and &#x27;T&#x27; Patrols left Cairo and crossed the desert to northwest of Kufra. On arrival they met with representatives from the Free French forces in Chad, and on 11 January carried out a joint raid on the Italian fort at Murzuk. After two hours&#x27; fighting the fort remained in Italian hands, but the adjoining airfield had been destroyed. The units then withdrew southwards towards the Free French post at Zouar.

On 31 January they were intercepted by the Compagnia Autosahariana di Cufra, an Italian unit similar to the LRDG, in the Gebel Sherif valley. The LRDG had one man killed and three men captured, including Major Clayton, and three trucks destroyed during the battle. The Italian losses were five killed and three wounded, and one truck was abandoned. Four members of the LRDG escaped by walking to safety in ten days with no food and only a two gallon water can between them. The patrol arrived back in Egypt on 9 February; it had covered about , experiencing the loss of six trucks, four by enemy action and two by mechanical breakdowns. One vehicle with a broken rear axle had been towed about before it could be repaired. Total casualties were three dead and three captured. Major Clayton was awarded the Distinguished Service Order.

After Operation Compass ended with the Italians forced out of Cyrenaica it was decided to move the LRDG from Cairo to Kufra (SE Libya). At the same time the LRDG was expanded with the addition of &#x27;Y&#x27; and &#x27;S&#x27; Patrols. When the German Afrika Korps under command of General Erwin Rommel counterattacked in April 1941, the LRDG was ordered to reinforce the Kufra area. &#x27;R&#x27; Patrol were based at Taiserbo, &#x27;S&#x27; Patrol at Zighen, and the headquarters LRDG, &#x27;T&#x27; Patrol, and the Free French were at Kufra, under command of Bagnold. The detached &#x27;G&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; Patrols were based at Siwa Oasis, under command of XIII Corps.

The LRDG air link was created during the occupation of Kufra by Major Guy Lenox Prendergast. Appreciating the value of aircraft for reconnaissance, liaison, evacuating wounded and flights to GHQ Cairo, he had two Waco aircraft fitted with long range fuel tanks. Prendergast flew one himself and Sergeant R. F. T. Barker flew the other. When Bagnold was appointed to the General Staff Cairo in August 1941, Prendergast was given command of the LRDG.

The LRDG now began a series of patrols behind the Axis lines. Near the end of July &#x27;T&#x27; Patrol left for the desert to the south of the Gulf of Sirte. One &#x27;T&#x27; Patrol truck managed to observe the main coastal road, along which Axis traffic was passing. They were followed two or three weeks later by &#x27;S&#x27; Patrol, who carried out a similar reconnaissance between Jalo oasis and Agedabia. Both patrols returned safely to Kufra without being discovered. In August 1941 &#x27;R&#x27; Patrol relieved &#x27;G&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; Patrols at Siwa and was joined by &#x27;T&#x27; Patrol in October.

===Eighth Army command===

In November 1941 the LRDG, now under command of the newly formed Eighth Army, moved from Kufra to Siwa (central Libya). The patrols were given the task of watching the desert tracks south of Jebel Akhdar and report any signs of reinforcements and withdrawals. &#x27;R1&#x27; Patrol was to pick up Captain David Stirling and 30 men who had parachuted behind the lines to raid airfields to the west of Tobruk. Only 21 men arrived at the rendezvous and were returned to the British lines, later becoming the nucleus of the Special Air Service (SAS). One of the other roles assigned to the LRDG was to transport SAS units behind enemy lines; this continued until the SAS were issued with their own transport in 1942. In early November &#x27;T2&#x27; Patrol took four British officers to the Gebel and was to return and collect them three weeks later. The officers were the advance land party of Operation Flipper, which had planned to kill General Rommel.

On 24 November, in support of Operation Crusader, the LRDG were ordered to attack Axis rear areas. Already on patrol, &#x27;Y1&#x27; and &#x27;Y2&#x27; Patrols attacked targets in the Mechili, Derna and Gazala area. &#x27;Y1&#x27; damaged fifteen vehicles in a transport park and &#x27;Y2&#x27; captured a small fort and about 20 Italians. &#x27;S2&#x27; and &#x27;R2&#x27; Patrols attacked targets in the Benghazi, Barce and Marawa area, where they ambushed nine vehicles. &#x27;G1&#x27; and &#x27;G2&#x27; Patrols were assigned the main road near Agedabia where &#x27;G1&#x27; made two attacks on road traffic and shot up a few vehicles. After the Axis forces withdrew from Cyrenaica the LRDG moved to a base at Jalo oasis, about to the south-south-east of Ajdabiya.

The last operations of 1941 were in December, when the LRDG twice ferried the SAS to and from raids on Axis airfields, attacking the airfields at Sirte (twice), El Agheila, Ajdabiya, Nofaliya and Tamit, and destroying 151 aircraft and 30 vehicles. During the second raid at Sirte, the SAS devised a new method of attacking parked aircraft. They drove the LRDG trucks between the rows of aircraft, which were then engaged by machine guns and hand grenades. Prior to this the procedure had been to quietly infiltrate an airfield and place Lewes bombs on aircraft and vehicles, leaving before the bombs exploded, but this attack was so successful that it became the preferred method for attacking airfields.

===Road watch===

When the LRDG was based at Siwa, they took part in what has since become known as the &#x27;Road Watch&#x27; along the Via Balbia (the Tripoli to Benghazi road). Three patrols were engaged on road watch duties at any one time, with one watching the road for a week to 10 days, another would be en route to relieve them and the third was returning to Siwa after having been relieved. The site of the road watch was about from the Marble Arch monument. The road watch patrol would park about 2 miles away from the road and the trucks would be camouflaged using camouflage nets, any local foliage and sand. Before dawn each day two men would move into a well camouflaged position about from the road. By day they would record the details of all vehicles and troop movements, and at night they would move to about from the road and guess what type of vehicles were passing by their sound and outline. At daylight they were relieved by another pair of men who took over that day&#x27;s road watch.

If tanks or a large number of troops were seen passing, they would radio the LRDG headquarters at Siwa immediately so that by the time the enemy reached the front line, GHQ at Cairo would know they were coming. Once a patrol was relieved they would transmit details of all they had seen back to Siwa. The LRDG did not lose any men or vehicles when on the road watch, but they did have some close encounters. On 21 March &#x27;R1&#x27; Patrol was surrounded by a convoy of 27 vehicles and about 200 men who stopped for the night between the watchers and their vehicles. While the road watch was ongoing, other patrols would be attacking targets along other stretches of the Tripoli to Benghazi road, by planting mines or attacking vehicles with machine gun fire. The road was kept under constant observation from 2 March to 21 July 1942.

After the Battle of Gazala and the fall of Tobruk, the LRDG were forced to withdraw from Siwa on 28 June. &#x27;A&#x27; Squadron withdrew to Cairo to resupply and then moved back to Kufra, while &#x27;B&#x27; Squadron moved to Faiyum.

===Barce===

With the Eighth Army now holding the El Alamein line, plans were submitted to attack the Axis supply lines and the ports of Benghazi and Tobruk. In September 1942, British Commandos would attack Tobruk by land and sea (Operation Agreement). The SAS would attack Benghazi (Operation Bigamy) and the Sudan Defence Force would capture Jalo oasis (Operation Nicety). The LRDG would be used to guide the attacking forces to their targets and at the same time, a LRDG force would attack Barce (Operation Caravan). The Barce force consisted of 17 vehicles and 47 men of &#x27;G1&#x27; and &#x27;T1&#x27; Patrols, which had to travel to reach their target. On arrival &#x27;T1&#x27; Patrol attacked the airfield and &#x27;G1&#x27; the Barce barracks. The attack on the airfield destroyed 35 aircraft according to an Italian prisoner of war. Official Italian figures quote 16 aircraft destroyed and seven damaged.

On 30 September 1942, the LRDG ceased to be under command of the Eighth Army and came under direct command of GHQ Middle East. The final LRDG operation in North Africa was in Tunisia during the Mareth Offensive when they guided the 2nd New Zealand Division around the Mareth Line in March 1943.

===Post 1943 operations===

In May 1943 the LRDG was sent to Lebanon to retrain in mountain warfare. However, following the Italian armistice in 1943, they were sent to Leros, one of the Dodecanese islands, to serve as normal infantry. They later took part in the Battle of Leros, where the commanding officer John Richard Easonsmith was killed and replaced by David Lloyd Owen. After the battle the New Zealanders, consisting of two officers and approximately 46 men, were withdrawn from the LRDG and returned to their division at the request of the New Zealand Government, which was concerned about their deployment to Leros.

In December 1943, the LRDG re-organised into two squadrons of eight patrols. Each patrol contained one officer and 10 other ranks. Major Moir Stormonth Darling was given command of the British Squadron and Major Kenneth Henry Lazarus the Rhodesian Squadron. Patrols were then parachuted north of Rome to obtain information about German troop movements, and also carried out raids on the Dalmatian Islands and Corfu.

In August 1944, British Squadron patrols were parachuted into Yugoslavia. One patrol destroyed two spans of a large railway bridge, which caused widespread disruption to the movement of German troops and supplies. The commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Owen and a team of 36 men were parachuted into Albania in September 1944. Their mission was to follow the German retreat and assist Albanian resistance groups in attacking them. In October 1944, two British Squadron patrols were parachuted into the Florina area of Greece. Here they mined a road used by the retreating Germans, destroying three vehicles and blocking the road. Firing on the stranded convoy from an adjacent hillside, they directed RAF aircraft in to destroy the rest of the convoy.

After the end of the war in Europe, the leaders of the LRDG made a request to the War Office for the unit to be transferred to the Far East to conduct operations against the Japanese Empire. The request was declined and the LRDG was disbanded in August 1945.

==Legacy==

The Long Range Desert Group was disbanded at the end of the Second World War. The only comparable British Army units today are the Mobility troops of the Special Air Service. Each of the regular army Special Air Service squadrons has a Mobility troop. Like the LRDG, they are specialists in using vehicles, trained in an advanced level of motor mechanics to fix any problem with their vehicles, and are experts in desert warfare.

The Long Range Desert Group is one of the Second World War units represented by the Special Air Service Association. Other wartime units represented include all the SAS regiments, the Special Raiding Squadron, the Special Boat Service (Wartime), the Phantom Signal Squadron, the Raiding Support Regiment and the Greek Sacred Squadron.
The New Zealand Army erected a permanent memorial to the LRDG at the New Zealand Special Air Service barracks, in the Papakura Military Camp. On 7 August 2009, two honour boards containing details of every New Zealand soldier who served in the LRDG were unveiled.

One of the LRDG&#x27;s Chevrolet WB trucks is displayed in the Imperial War Museum in London. It was presented to the museum by the LRDG Association, after being recovered from the Libyan desert in 1983 by David Lloyd Owen, by then a retired Major General and chairman of the Association. It is preserved in the condition in which it was discovered, rusted but largely intact.

As of 2022, there is only one surviving member of the group, Jack Mann.

<doc id="99231" wikidata="Q5177544" url="?curid=99231" title="Countryside Agency">
<text>The Countryside Agency was a statutory body set up in England in 1999 with the task of improving the quality of the rural environment and the lives of those living in it. The agency was dissolved in 2006 and its functions dispersed among other bodies.

== Formation ==
The agency was formed by merging the Countryside Commission and the Rural Development Commission. Its powers were inherited from those bodies. The agency was based in Cheltenham with smaller offices in London and the regions. Total staff numbers were around 600.

== Role ==
The Agency was a government-funded advisory and promotional body; it owned no land and managed no facilities. Its funding came from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) as an annual budget of around £100 million. The Countryside Agency worked with other bodies, such as local authorities, landowners and other public agencies, to provide grants and advice to conserve the natural beauty of the landscape, promote rural economies and make the countryside more accessible to the public.

The Countryside Agency had special responsibility for designating national parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, defining heritage coasts, and establishing long-distance trails for walkers and riders. In 2003, it initiated the designation of England&#x27;s newest national park, the South Downs National Park. 

In 2004, the Agency partnered with the Countryside Council for Wales to introduce The Countryside Code, an updated version of The Country Code.

===Millennium Greens===

The Agency inherited a project to create Millennium Greens, and 245 out of the 250 planned were created by the end of the project, just after 2000. Minimal government responsibility for these greens was then passed to Natural England on its creation.

== Closure ==
Following a review by Christopher Haskins of several Government organisations involved in rural policy and delivery, the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 dissolved the agency. Those parts of the Countryside Agency charged with environmental activity were merged with English Nature and parts of the Rural Development Service to form Natural England. The socio-economic functions of the Rural Development Commission had already transferred to the Regional Development Agencies in 1999 (they were in their turn replaced by local enterprise partnerships in 2012). The remaining parts of the Countryside Agency, largely research and policy functions, became the Commission for Rural Communities which was abolished in 2013.

<text>A political movement is a collective attempt by a group of people to change government policy or social values. Political movements are usually in opposition to an element of the status quo, and are often associated with a certain ideology. Some theories of political movements are the political opportunity theory, which states that political movements stem from mere circumstances, and the resource mobilization theory which states that political movements result from strategic organization and relevant resources. Political movements are also related to political parties in the sense that they both aim to make an impact on the government and that several political parties have emerged from initial political movements. While political parties are engaged with a multitude of issues, political movements tend to focus on only one major issue.

An organization in a political movement that is led by a communist party is termed a mass organization by the party and a &quot;Communist front&quot; by detractors.

== Political movement theories ==
Some of the theories behind social movements have also been applied to the emergence of political movements in specific, like the political opportunity theory and the resource mobilization theory.

=== Political opportunity theory ===
The political opportunity theory asserts that political movements occur through chance or certain opportunities and have little to do with resources, connections or grievances in society. Political opportunities can be created by possible changes in the political system, structure or by other developments in the political sphere and they are the driving force for political movements to be established.

=== Resource mobilization theory ===
The resource mobilization theory states that political movements are the result of careful planning, organizing and fundraising rather than spontaneous uprisings or societal grievances. This theory postulates that movements rely on resources and contact to the establishment in order to fully develop. Thus, at the beginning and core of a political movement there lies a strategic mobilization of individuals.

== Relation to political parties ==
Political movements are different from political parties since movements are usually focused on a single issue and they have no interest in attaining office in government. A political movement is generally an informal organization and uses unconventional methods to achieve their goals. In a political party, a political organization seeks to influence or control government policy through conventional methods, usually by nominating their candidates and seating candidates in politics and governmental offices.

However, political parties and movements both aim to influence government in one way or another and both are often related to a certain ideology. Parties also participate in electoral campaigns and educational outreach or protest actions aiming to convince citizens or governments to take action on the issues and concerns which are the focus of the movement. 

Some political movements have turned into or launched political parties. For example, the 15-M Movement against austerity in Spain led to the creation of the populist party Podemos and the labor movements in Brazil helped form the Brazilian Workers&#x27; Party. These types of movement parties serve to raise awareness on the main issue of their initial political movement in government, since the established parties may have neglected this issue in the past.

Political scientists Santos and Mercea argue that, in recent years, &quot;the rise of movement parties across Europe has disrupted traditional notions of party politics and opened up new avenues for citizen engagement and political mobilisation. Movement parties are the reflection of a wider socio-political transformation of increasing interconnection between electoral and non-electoral politics&quot;. They identify four types of movement parties: green/left-libertarian, far-right, eclectic, and centrist.

For groups seeking to influence policy, social movements can provide an alternative to formal electoral politics. For example, the political scientist S. Laurel Weldon has shown that women&#x27;s movements and women&#x27;s policy agencies have tended to be more effective in reducing violence against women than the presence of women in the legislatures.

High barriers to entry to the political competition can disenfranchise political movements.

== Examples ==
Some political movements have aimed to change government policy, such as the anti-war movement, the ecology movement, alter-globalization and the anti-globalization movement. With globalization, global citizens movements may have also emerged. Many political movements have aimed to establish or broaden the rights of subordinate groups, such as abolitionism, the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, the civil rights movement, feminism, gay rights movement, the disability rights movement, the animal rights movement, or the inclusive human rights movement. Some have represented class interests, such as the labour movement, socialism, and communism, while others have expressed national aspirations, including both anticolonialist movements, such as Rātana and Sinn Féin, as well as colonialist movements such as Manifest destiny. Political movements can also involve struggles to decentralize or centralize state control, as in anarchism, fascism, and Nazism.

Famous recent social movements can be classified as political movements as they have influenced policy changes at all levels of government. Political movements that have recently emerged within the US are the Black Lives Matter Movement, and the Me Too Movement. While political movements that have happened in recent years within the Middle East is the Arab Spring. While in some cases these political movements remained movements, in others they escalated into revolutions and changed the state of government.

Movements may also be named by outsiders, as with the Levellers political movement in 17th century England, which was named so as a term of disparagement. Yet admirers of the movement and its aims later came to use the term, and it is this term by which they are most known to history.

==Mass movements==

A mass movement denotes a political party or movement which is supported by large segments of a population. Political movements that typically advocate the creation of a mass movement include the ideologies of communism, fascism, and liberalism. Both communists and fascists typically support the creation of mass movements as a means to overthrow a government and create their own government, the mass movement then being used afterwards to protect the government from being overthrown itself; whereas liberals seek mass participation in the system of representative democracy.

The social scientific study of mass movements focuses on such elements as charisma, leadership, active minorities, cults and sects, followers, mass man and mass society, alienation, brainwashing and indoctrination, authoritarianism and totalitarianism. The field emerged from crowd or mass psychology (Le Bon, Tarde a.o.), which had gradually widened its scope from mobs to social movements and opinion currents, and then to mass and media society. 

One influential early text was the double essay on the herd instinct (1908) by British surgeon Wilfred Trotter. It also influenced the key concepts of the superego and identification in Massenpsychologie (1921) by Sigmund Freud, misleadingly translated as Group psychology. They are linked to ideas on sexual repression leading to rigid personalities, in the original Mass psychology of fascism (1933) by Freudo-Marxist Wilhelm Reich (not to be confused with its totally revised 1946 American version). This then rejoined ideas formulated by the Frankfurt School and Theodor Adorno, ultimately leading to a major American study of the authoritarian personality (1950), as a basis for xenophobia and anti-Semitism.
Another early theme was the relationship between masses and elites, both outside and within such movements (Gaetano Mosca, Vilfredo Pareto, Robert Michels, Moisey Ostrogorski).

<text>Aleatoric music (also aleatory music or chance music; from the Latin word &quot;alea&quot;, meaning &quot;dice&quot;) is music in which some element of the composition is left to chance, and/or some primary element of a composed work&#x27;s realization is left to the determination of its performer(s). The term is most often associated with procedures in which the chance element involves a relatively limited number of possibilities.

The term became known to European composers through lectures by acoustician Werner Meyer-Eppler at the Darmstadt International Summer Courses for New Music in the beginning of the 1950s. According to his definition, &quot;a process is said to be aleatoric ... if its course is determined in general but depends on chance in detail&quot;. Through a confusion of Meyer-Eppler&#x27;s German terms &quot;Aleatorik&quot; (noun) and &quot;aleatorisch&quot; (adjective), his translator created a new English word, &quot;aleatoric&quot; (rather than using the existing English adjective &quot;aleatory&quot;), which quickly became fashionable and has persisted. More recently, the variant &quot;aleatoriality&quot; has been introduced.

==History==
===Early precedents===
Compositions that could be considered a precedent for aleatory composition date back to at least the late 15th century, with the genre of the catholicon, exemplified by the &quot;Missa cuiusvis toni&quot; of Johannes Ockeghem. A later genre was the &quot;Musikalisches Würfelspiel&quot; or musical dice game, popular in the late 18th and early 19th century. (Such dice games are attributed to Carl Phillip Emanuel Bach, Franz Joseph Haydn, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.) These games consisted of a sequence of musical measures, for which each measure had several possible versions and a procedure for selecting the precise sequence based on the throwing of a number of dice.

The French artist Marcel Duchamp composed two pieces between 1913 and 1915 based on chance operations. One of these, &quot;Erratum Musical&quot;, written with Duchamp&#x27;s sisters Yvonne and Magdeleine for three voices, was first performed at the Manifestation of Dada on 27 March 1920, and was eventually published in 1934. Two of his contemporaries, Francis Picabia and Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes, also experimented with chance composition, these works being performed at a Festival Dada staged at the Salle Gaveau concert hall, Paris, on 26 May 1920. American composer John Cage&#x27;s &quot;Music of Changes&quot; (1951) was &quot;the first composition to be largely determined by random procedures&quot;, though his indeterminacy is of a different order from Meyer-Eppler&#x27;s concept. Cage later asked Duchamp: &quot;How is it that you used chance operations when I was just being born?&quot;

===Modern usage===
The earliest significant use of aleatory features is found in many of the compositions of American Charles Ives in the early 20th century. Henry Cowell adopted Ives&#x27;s ideas during the 1930s, in such works as the &quot;Mosaic Quartet&quot; (String Quartet No. 3, 1934), which allows the players to arrange the fragments of music in a number of different possible sequences. Cowell also used specially devised notations to introduce variability into the performance of a work, sometimes instructing the performers to improvise a short passage or play &quot;ad libitum&quot;. Later American composers, such as Alan Hovhaness (beginning with his &quot;Lousadzak&quot; of 1944) used procedures superficially similar to Cowell&#x27;s, in which different short patterns with specified pitches and rhythm are assigned to several parts, with instructions that they be performed repeatedly at their own speed without coordination with the rest of the ensemble. Some scholars regard the resultant blur as &quot;hardly aleatory, since exact pitches are carefully controlled and any two performances will be substantially the same&quot; although, according to another writer, this technique is essentially the same as that later used by Witold Lutosławski. Depending on the vehemence of the technique, Hovhaness&#x27;s published scores annotate these sections variously, for example as &quot;Free tempo / humming effect&quot; and &quot;Repeat and repeat ad lib, but not together&quot;.

In Europe, following the introduction of the expression &quot;aleatory music&quot; by Meyer-Eppler, the French composer Pierre Boulez was largely responsible for popularizing the term.

Other early European examples of aleatory music include Klavierstück XI (1956) by Karlheinz Stockhausen, which features 19 elements to be performed in a sequence to be determined in each case by the performer. A form of limited aleatory was used by Witold Lutosławski (beginning with &quot;Jeux Vénitiens&quot; in 1960–61), where extensive passages of pitches and rhythms are fully specified, but the rhythmic coordination of parts within the ensemble is subject to an element of chance.

There has been much confusion of the terms aleatory and indeterminate/chance music. One of Cage&#x27;s pieces, &quot;HPSCHD&quot;, itself composed using chance procedures, uses music from Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Musikalisches Würfelspiel&quot;, referred to above, as well as original music.

==Types of indeterminate music==
Some writers do not make a distinction between aleatory, chance, and indeterminacy in music, and use the terms interchangeably. From this point of view, indeterminate or chance music can be divided into three groups: (1) the use of random procedures to produce a determinate, fixed score, (2) mobile form, and (3) indeterminate notation, including graphic notation and texts.

The first group includes scores in which the chance element is involved only in the process of composition, so that every parameter is fixed before their performance. In John Cage&#x27;s &quot;Music of Changes&quot; (1951), for example, the composer selected duration, tempo, and dynamics by using the &quot;I Ching&quot;, an ancient Chinese book which prescribes methods for arriving at random numbers. Because this work is absolutely fixed from performance to performance, Cage regarded it as an entirely determinate work made using chance procedures. On the level of detail, Iannis Xenakis used probability theories to define some microscopic aspects of &quot;Pithoprakta&quot; (1955–56), which is Greek for &quot;actions by means of probability&quot;. This work contains four sections, characterized by textural and timbral attributes, such as glissandi and pizzicati. At the macroscopic level, the sections are designed and controlled by the composer while the single components of sound are controlled by mathematical theories.

In the second type of indeterminate music, chance elements involve the performance. Notated events are provided by the composer, but their arrangement is left to the determination of the performer. Karlheinz Stockhausen&#x27;s Klavierstück XI (1956) presents nineteen events which are composed and notated in a traditional way, but the arrangement of these events is determined by the performer spontaneously during the performance. In Earle Brown&#x27;s &quot;Available forms II&quot; (1962), the conductor is asked to decide the order of the events at the very moment of the performance.

The greatest degree of indeterminacy is reached by the third type of indeterminate music, where traditional musical notation is replaced by visual or verbal signs suggesting how a work can be performed, for example in graphic score pieces. Earle Brown&#x27;s &quot;December 1952&quot; (1952) shows lines and rectangles of various lengths and thicknesses that can read as loudness, duration, or pitch. The performer chooses how to read them. Another example is Morton Feldman&#x27;s &quot;Intersection No. 2&quot; (1951) for piano solo, written on coordinate paper. Time units are represented by the squares viewed horizontally, while relative pitch levels of high, middle, and low are indicated by three vertical squares in each row. The performer determines what particular pitches and rhythms to play.

==Open form music==
Open form is a term sometimes used for &#x27;mobile&#x27; or &#x27;polyvalent&#x27; musical forms, where the order of movements or sections is indeterminate or left up to the performer. Roman Haubenstock-Ramati composed a series of influential &quot;mobiles&quot; such as &quot;Interpolation&quot; (1958).

However, &quot;open form&quot; in music is also used in the sense defined by the art historian Heinrich Wölfflin to mean a work which is fundamentally incomplete, represents an unfinished activity, or points outside of itself. In this sense, a &quot;mobile form&quot; can be either &quot;open&quot; or &quot;closed&quot;. An example of a &quot;dynamic, closed&quot; mobile musical composition is Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Zyklus&quot; (1959).

==Stochastic music==
Stochastic processes may be used in music to compose a fixed piece or may be produced in performance. Stochastic music was pioneered by Xenakis, who coined the term &quot;stochastic music&quot;. Specific examples of mathematics, statistics, and physics applied to music composition are the use of the statistical mechanics of gases in &quot;Pithoprakta&quot;, statistical distribution of points on a plane in &quot;Diamorphoses&quot;, minimal constraints in &quot;Achorripsis&quot;, the normal distribution in &quot;ST/10&quot; and &quot;Atrées&quot;, Markov chains in &quot;Analogiques&quot;, game theory in &quot;Duel&quot; and &quot;Stratégie&quot;, group theory in &quot;Nomos Alpha&quot; (for Siegfried Palm), set theory in &quot;Herma&quot; and &quot;Eonta&quot;, and Brownian motion in &quot;N&#x27;Shima&quot;.
Xenakis frequently used computers to produce his scores, such as the &quot;ST&quot; series including &quot;Morsima-Amorsima&quot; and &quot;Atrées&quot;, and founded CEMAMu.

==Film music==
Examples of extensive aleatoric writing can be found in small passages from John Williams&#x27; score for the film &quot;Images&quot;. Other film composers using this technique are Mark Snow (&quot;X-Files: Fight the Future&quot;), John Corigliano, and others. Snow used digital samples of acoustic instruments &quot;to merge starkly electronic timbres with acoustically based sounds, an approach developed extensively in his much celebrated music for &quot;The X-Files&quot; (1993–2002, 2016–18). Over the course of the series, Snow&#x27;s often ambient music dissolved distinctions between sound design and musical score.&quot;

Howard Shore employed aleatoric composition in &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; during the Fellowship&#x27;s encounter with the Watcher in the Water outside of the gates of Moria.

<doc id="99236" wikidata="Q13125592" url="?curid=99236" title="Heritage coast">
<text>A heritage coast is a strip of coastline in England and Wales, the extent of which is defined by agreement between the relevant statutory national agency and the relevant local authority. Such areas are recognised for their natural beauty, wildlife and heritage and amongst the purposes of definition is support for these qualities and enabling enjoyment of them by the public. For England this national agency is Natural England (having formerly been the Countryside Agency) and for Wales it is Natural Resources Wales (which took over the role from its predecessor body, Countryside Council for Wales).

==Designated coastline==
1,057 km of the English coastline and 495 km of the Welsh coastline, in both cases approximately one-third of the total length, have been defined as heritage coast. The goal is to conserve their natural beauty and improve accessibility for visitors.

Unlike national parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs), the heritage coast designation is non-statutory, and designations can only be made with the agreement of local authorities and landowners. However, the majority of heritage coast falls within statutorily designated landscapes such as national parks, AONBs and the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. These coincident designations are listed in the fourth column of the tables below. Designations for nature conservation (as opposed to landscape, e.g. SSSI, Special Area of Conservation and Special Protection Area) of parts of Heritage Coasts are too numerous and complex to easily list here.

The southern coast of Wales and Devon and Cornwall in south west England have more heritage coastline per mile than other regions, including over 50% of the coast between Cardiff and St Davids, about 55-60% of Cornwall&#x27;s coast, and around 60-65% of Devon&#x27;s coast. This contrasts with the coasts of North West England, where St Bees Head is the only heritage coast, or the south-east stretch of the English Channel which has only very sporadic stretches.

The first heritage coast was Beachy Head with its famous white cliffs.

==List of heritage coasts==

<doc id="99242" wikidata="Q77219" url="?curid=99242" title="Hermann Grassmann">
<text>Hermann Günther Grassmann (, ; 15 April 1809 – 26 September 1877) was a German polymath known in his day as a linguist and now also as a mathematician. He was also a physicist, general scholar, and publisher. His mathematical work was little noted until he was in his sixties. His work preceded and exceeded the concept which is now known as a vector space. He introduced the Grassmannian, the space which parameterizes all &quot;k&quot;-dimensional linear subspaces of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot;. In linguistics he helped free language history and structure from each other.

==Biography==

Hermann Grassmann was the third of 12 children of Justus Günter Grassmann, an ordained minister who taught mathematics and physics at the Stettin Gymnasium, where Hermann was educated.

Grassmann was an undistinguished student until he obtained a high mark on the examinations for admission to Prussian universities. Beginning in 1827, he studied theology at the University of Berlin, also taking classes in classical languages, philosophy, and literature. He does not appear to have taken courses in mathematics or physics.

Although lacking university training in mathematics, it was the field that most interested him when he returned to Stettin in 1830 after completing his studies in Berlin. After a year of preparation, he sat the examinations needed to teach mathematics in a gymnasium, but achieved a result good enough to allow him to teach only at the lower levels. Around this time, he made his first significant mathematical discoveries, ones that led him to the important ideas he set out in his 1844 paper &quot;Die lineale Ausdehnungslehre, ein neuer Zweig der Mathematik&quot;, here referred to as A1, later revised in 1862 as &quot;Die Ausdehnungslehre: Vollständig und in strenger Form bearbeitet&quot;, here referred to as A2.

In 1834 Grassmann began teaching mathematics at the Gewerbeschule in Berlin. A year later, he returned to Stettin to teach mathematics, physics, German, Latin, and religious studies at a new school, the Otto Schule. Over the next four years, Grassmann passed examinations enabling him to teach mathematics, physics, chemistry, and mineralogy at all secondary school levels.

In 1847, he was made an &quot;Oberlehrer&quot; or head teacher. In 1852, he was appointed to his late father&#x27;s position at the Stettin Gymnasium, thereby acquiring the title of Professor. In 1847, he asked the Prussian Ministry of Education to be considered for a university position, whereupon that Ministry asked Ernst Kummer for his opinion of Grassmann. Kummer wrote back saying that Grassmann&#x27;s 1846 prize essay (see below) contained &quot;commendably good material expressed in a deficient form.&quot; Kummer&#x27;s report ended any chance that Grassmann might obtain a university post. This episode proved the norm; time and again, leading figures of Grassmann&#x27;s day failed to recognize the value of his mathematics.

Starting during the political turmoil in Germany, 1848–49, Hermann and his brother Robert published a Stettin newspaper, &quot;Deutsche Wochenschrift für Staat, Kirche und Volksleben&quot;, calling for German unification under a constitutional monarchy. (This eventuated in 1871.) After writing a series of articles on constitutional law, Hermann parted company with the newspaper, finding himself increasingly at odds with its political direction.

Grassmann had eleven children, seven of whom reached adulthood. A son, Hermann Ernst Grassmann, became a professor of mathematics at the University of Giessen.

==Mathematician==
One of the many examinations for which Grassmann sat required that he submit an essay on the theory of the tides. In 1840, he did so, taking the basic theory from Laplace&#x27;s &quot;Traité de mécanique céleste&quot; and from Lagrange&#x27;s &quot;Mécanique analytique&quot;, but expositing this theory making use of the vector methods he had been mulling over since 1832. This essay, first published in the &quot;Collected Works&quot; of 1894–1911, contains the first known appearance of what is now called linear algebra and the notion of a vector space. He went on to develop those methods in his &quot;Die lineale Ausdehnungslehre, ein neuer Zweig der Mathematik&quot; (A1) and its later revision &quot;Die Ausdehnungslehre: Vollständig und in strenger Form bearbeitet&quot; (A2).

In 1844, Grassmann published his masterpiece (A1) commonly referred to as the &quot;Ausdehnungslehre&quot;, which translates as &quot;theory of extension&quot; or &quot;theory of extensive magnitudes&quot;. Since A1 proposed a new foundation for all of mathematics, the work began with quite general definitions of a philosophical nature. Grassmann then showed that once geometry is put into the algebraic form he advocated, the number three has no privileged role as the number of spatial dimensions; the number of possible dimensions is in fact unbounded.

Fearnley-Sander describes Grassmann&#x27;s foundation of linear algebra as follows:

Following an idea of Grassmann&#x27;s father, A1 also defined the exterior product, also called &quot;combinatorial product&quot; (in German: &quot;kombinatorisches Produkt&quot; or &quot;äußeres Produkt&quot; “outer product”), the key operation of an algebra now called exterior algebra. (One should keep in mind that in Grassmann&#x27;s day, the only axiomatic theory was Euclidean geometry, and the general notion of an abstract algebra had yet to be defined.) In 1878, William Kingdon Clifford joined this exterior algebra to William Rowan Hamilton&#x27;s quaternions by replacing Grassmann&#x27;s rule &quot;epep&quot; = 0 by the rule &quot;epep&quot; = 1. (For quaternions, we have the rule &quot;i&quot;2 = &quot;j&quot;2 = &quot;k&quot;2 = −1.) For more details, see Exterior algebra.

A1 was a revolutionary text, too far ahead of its time to be appreciated. When Grassmann submitted it to apply for a professorship in 1847, the ministry asked Ernst Kummer for a report. Kummer assured that there were good ideas in it, but found the exposition deficient and advised against giving Grassmann a university position. Over the next 10-odd years, Grassmann wrote a variety of work applying his theory of extension, including his 1845 &quot;Neue Theorie der Elektrodynamik&quot; and several papers on algebraic curves and surfaces, in the hope that these applications would lead others to take his theory seriously.

In 1846, Möbius invited Grassmann to enter a competition to solve a problem first proposed by Leibniz: to devise a geometric calculus devoid of coordinates and metric properties (what Leibniz termed &quot;analysis situs&quot;). Grassmann&#x27;s &quot;Geometrische Analyse geknüpft an die von Leibniz erfundene geometrische Charakteristik&quot;, was the winning entry (also the only entry). Möbius, as one of the judges, criticized the way Grassmann introduced abstract notions without giving the reader any intuition as to why those notions were of value.

In 1853, Grassmann published a theory of how colors mix; his theory&#x27;s four color laws are still taught, as Grassmann&#x27;s laws. Grassmann&#x27;s work on this subject was inconsistent with that of Helmholtz. Grassmann also wrote on crystallography, electromagnetism, and mechanics.

In 1861, Grassmann laid the groundwork for Peano&#x27;s axiomatization of arithmetic in his &quot;Lehrbuch der Arithmetik&quot;. In 1862, Grassmann published a thoroughly rewritten second edition of A1, hoping to earn belated recognition for his theory of extension, and containing the definitive exposition of his linear algebra. The result, &quot;Die Ausdehnungslehre: Vollständig und in strenger Form bearbeitet&quot; (A2), fared no better than A1, even though A2 manner of exposition anticipates the textbooks of the 20th century.

==Response==
In the 1840s, mathematicians were generally unprepared to understand Grassmann&#x27;s ideas. In the 1860s and 1870s various mathematicians came to ideas similar to that of Grassmann&#x27;s, but Grassmann himself was not interested in mathematics anymore.

Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant developed a vector calculus similar to that of Grassmann, which he published in 1845. He then entered into a dispute with Grassmann about which of the two had thought of the ideas first. Grassmann had published his results in 1844, but Saint-Venant claimed that he had first developed these ideas in 1832.

One of the first mathematicians to appreciate Grassmann&#x27;s ideas during his lifetime was Hermann Hankel, whose 1867 &quot;Theorie der complexen Zahlensysteme&quot;.
In 1872 Victor Schlegel published the first part of his &quot;System der Raumlehre&quot;, which used Grassmann&#x27;s approach to derive ancient and modern results in plane geometry. Felix Klein wrote a negative review of Schlegel&#x27;s book citing its incompleteness and lack of perspective on Grassmann. Schlegel followed in 1875 with a second part of his &quot;System&quot; according to Grassmann, this time developing higher-dimensional geometry. Meanwhile, Klein was advancing his Erlangen program, which also expanded the scope of geometry.

Comprehension of Grassmann awaited the concept of vector spaces, which then could express the multilinear algebra of his extension theory. To establish the priority of Grassmann over Hamilton, Josiah Willard Gibbs urged Grassmann&#x27;s heirs to have the 1840 essay on tides published. A. N. Whitehead&#x27;s first monograph, the &quot;Universal Algebra&quot; (1898), included the first systematic exposition in English of the theory of extension and the exterior algebra. With the rise of differential geometry the exterior algebra was applied to differential forms.

In 1995 Lloyd C. Kannenberg published an English translation of The Ausdehnungslehre and Other works. For an introduction to the role of Grassmann&#x27;s work in contemporary mathematical physics see &quot;The Road to Reality&quot; by Roger Penrose.

==Linguist==
Grassmann&#x27;s mathematical ideas began to spread only towards the end of his life. Thirty years after the publication of A1 the publisher wrote to Grassmann: “Your book &quot;Die Ausdehnungslehre&quot; has been out of print for some time. Since your work hardly sold at all, roughly 600 copies were used in 1864 as waste paper and the remaining few odd copies have now been sold out, with the exception of the one copy in our library.” Disappointed by the reception of his work in mathematical circles, Grassmann lost his contacts with mathematicians as well as his interest in geometry. In the last years of his life he turned to historical linguistics and the study of Sanskrit. He wrote books on German grammar, collected folk songs, and learned Sanskrit. He wrote a 2,000-page dictionary and a translation of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; (more than 1,000 pages). In modern studies of the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, Grassmann&#x27;s work is often cited. In 1955 a third edition of his dictionary was issued.

Grassmann also noticed and presented a phonological rule that exists in both Sanskrit and Greek. In his honor, this phonological rule is known as Grassmann&#x27;s law. His discovery was revolutionary for historical linguistics at the time, as it challenged the widespread notion of Sanskrit as an older predecessor to other Indo-European languages. This was a widespread assumption due to Sanskrit&#x27;s more agglutinative structure, which languages like Latin and Greek were thought to have passed through to reach their more &quot;modern&quot; synthetic structure. However, Grassman&#x27;s work proved that, in at least one phonological pattern, German was indeed &quot;older&quot; (i.e., less synthetic) than Sanskrit. This meant that genealogical and typological classifications of languages were at last correctly separated in linguistics, allowing significant progress for later linguists.

These philological accomplishments were honored during his lifetime. He was elected to the American Oriental Society and in 1876 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Tübingen.

<text>The King&#x27;s Cross fire occurred in 1987 at King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras tube station in London, England, causing 31 fatalities. It began under a wooden escalator before spreading into the ticket hall in a flashover.

The fire began at approximately 19:30 on 18 November 1987, at a major interchange on the London Underground. As well as the mainline railway stations above ground and subsurface platforms for the Metropolitan, Circle, and Hammersmith &amp; City lines, there were platforms deeper underground for the Northern, Piccadilly, and Victoria lines. 

A public inquiry was conducted from February to June 1988. Investigators reproduced the fire twice, once to determine whether grease under the escalator was ignitable, and the other to determine whether a computer simulation of the firewhich would have determined the cause of the flashoverwas accurate. The inquiry determined that the fire had been started by a lit match being dropped onto the escalator. The fire seemed minor until it suddenly increased in intensity, and shot a violent, prolonged tongue of fire, and billowing smoke, up into the ticket hall. This sudden transition in intensity, and the spout of fire, was due to the previously unknown trench effect, discovered by the computer simulation of the fire, and confirmed in two tests on scale models.

London Underground was strongly criticised for its attitude toward fires; staff were complacent because there had never been a fatal fire on the system, and had been given little or no training to deal with fires or evacuation. The report on the inquiry resulted in resignations of senior management in both London Underground and London Regional Transport and led to the introduction of new fire safety regulations. Wooden escalators were gradually replaced with metal escalators on the Underground.

==Fire==
King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras tube station has subsurface platforms for the Metropolitan, Circle, and Hammersmith &amp; City lines. Deeper underground are the platforms for the Northern line City branch and the Piccadilly and Victoria lines. An escalator shaft led down to the Victoria line and another led down to the Piccadilly line, and from that to the Northern line. Stairs connected the Piccadilly and Victoria line platforms and from these there was a subway to King&#x27;s Cross Thameslink railway station platforms used by British Rail Midland City (later Thameslink) trains to and an entrance in Pentonville Road.

At approximately 19:30, several passengers reported seeing a fire on a Piccadilly line escalator. Officers of the British Transport Police (BTP) and station staff went to investigate and on confirming the fire one of the policemen went to the surface to radio for the London Fire Brigade (LFB), which sent four fire appliances and a turntable ladder at 19:36. The fire was beneath the escalator and was impossible to reach by use of a fire extinguisher. There was water fog equipment, but staff had not been trained in its use. At 19:39, BTP officers made the decision to evacuate the station using the Victoria line escalators. The LFB arrived a few minutes later, and several firemen went down to the escalator to assess the fire. They saw a fire about the size of a large cardboard box, and planned to fight it with a water jet and men with breathing apparatus.

At 19:42, the entire escalator was aflame, producing superheated gas that rose to the top of the shaft enclosing the escalator, where it was trapped against the tunnel ceiling, which was covered with about twenty layers of old paint from past repainting. As the superheated gases pooled along the ceiling of the escalator shaft, the layers of paint began absorbing the heat. A few years before the fire, the Underground&#x27;s director of operations had warned that the accumulated paint might pose a fire hazard. However, painting protocols were not in his purview, and his suggestion was widely ignored by his colleagues.

At 19:45, there was a flashover and a jet of flames shot up the escalator shaft, filling the ticket hall with intense heat and thick black smoke, killing or seriously injuring most of the people still in the ticket hall. This trapped below ground several hundred people, who escaped on Victoria line trains. A police constable, Richard Kukielka, found a seriously injured man and tried to evacuate him via the Midland City platforms, but found the way blocked by a locked Bostwick gate until it was unlocked by a passing cleaner. Staff and a policewoman trapped on a Metropolitan line platform were rescued by a train.

At 22:00, the full horror of the fire blaze was evident, after the death toll jumped to 28. David Fitzsimons, a Metropolitan Police superintendent, told reporters: &quot;We are talking about a major tragedy; many people are horribly burned.&quot;

Thirty fire crewsover 150 firefighterswere deployed. Fourteen London Ambulance Service ambulances ferried the injured to local hospitals, including University College Hospital. The fire was declared out at 01:46 the following day. On a television programme about the fire, an official described King&#x27;s Cross underground station&#x27;s layout as &quot;an efficient furnace&quot;.

== Victims ==
Thirty-one people died in the fire and 100 people were taken to hospital, 19 with serious injuries.

LFB Station Officer Colin Townsley was in charge of the first pump fire engine to arrive at the scene, and was in the ticket hall at the time of the flashover. He was killed in the fire; his body was found beside that of a badly burnt passenger at the base of the exit steps to Pancras Road. It is believed that Townsley spotted the passenger in difficulty and stopped to help her. An initially unidentified man, commonly known as &quot;Michael&quot; or &quot;Body 115&quot; in reference to a mortuary tag, was identified on 22 January 2004, when forensic evidence confirmed he was 73-year-old Alexander Fallon of Falkirk, Scotland.

==Aftermath==
The ticket hall and platforms for the Metropolitan and Circle lines were undamaged and reopened next morning; the Victoria line, its escalators only slightly damaged, resumed normal operation on the following Tuesday. The ticket hall for the three tube lines was reopened in stages over four weeks. The three escalators for the Piccadilly line had to be completely replaced, the new ones being commissioned on 27 February 1989, more than 16months after the fire. Until then, the Piccadilly line could only be reached via the Victoria line or Midland City platforms, and at peak hours in one direction only.

Access to the Northern line platforms was indirect, its escalators connecting with the Piccadilly line. As the traffic from all three tube lines would have overcrowded the Victoria line escalators, Northern line trains did not stop at King&#x27;s Cross until repairs were complete. The nearly-life-expired Northern line escalators were replaced as well; the Northern line station reopened, completing the return to normal operation, on 5 March 1989.

==Investigation and report==
A public inquiry into the incident was initiated by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. It was conducted by Desmond Fennell, assisted by a panel of four expert advisers. The inquiry opened on 1 February 1988 at Central Hall, Westminster, and closed on 24 June, after hearing 91 days of evidence.
Smoking on Underground trains was banned in July 1984, over three years before the fire. Following a fire at Oxford Circus station in November 1984, the ban was extended to all Underground stations in February 1985. However, smokers often ignored this and lit cigarettes on the escalators on their way out. The inquiry found that the fire was most probably caused by a traveller discarding a burning match that fell down the side of the moving staircase on to the running track of the escalator. The police decided that the fire had not been started deliberately, as there was no evidence that an accelerant had been used and access to the site of the fire was difficult. Investigators found charred wood in eight places on a section of skirting on an escalator and matches in the running track, showing that similar fires had started before but had burnt themselves out without spreading. The investigators found a build-up of lubricant grease under the tracks, which was believed to be difficult to ignite and slow to burn once it started, but it was noted that the grease was heavily saturated with fibrous materials (fluff from clothes, tickets and other small litter, human hair, rat fur, etc.). A test was conducted where lit matches were dropped on the escalator to see if ignition would occur. Dropped matches ignited the contaminated grease and the fire began spreading. It was allowed to burn for nine minutes before being extinguished.

This test confirmed the initial eyewitness reports up to that point, but four expert witnesses could not agree as to how the small fire flashed over, with some concern that the paint used on the ceiling had contributed to the fire. A model of King&#x27;s Cross station was built at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment using computer simulation software; this showed the flames lying down along the floor of the escalator rather than burning vertically before producing a jet of flame into the ticket hall. The result matched the eyewitness accounts of the fire, but the simulation&#x27;s depiction of the fire burning parallel to the 30-degree slope of the escalator was thought by some to be unlikely and it was suspected that the programming might be faulty. Experiments were conducted with a one-third-scale replica of the escalator built at the UK&#x27;s Health and Safety Executive site at Buxton. After seven-and-a-half minutes of normal burning, the flames lay down as in the computer simulation. The metal sides of the escalator served to contain the flames and direct the temperature ahead of the fire. When the wooden treads of the escalator flashed over, the size of the fire increased dramatically and a sustained jet of flame was discharged from the escalator tunnel into the model ticket hall. The 30-degree angle of the escalators was discovered to be crucial to the incident, and the large number of casualties in the fire was an indirect consequence of a fluid flow phenomenon that was later named the trench effect, a phenomenon completely unknown before the fire. The conclusion was that this newly discovered trench effect had caused the fire to flash over at 19:45.

London Underground was strongly criticised in the report for its attitude to fires underground, underestimating the hazard because no one had died in a fire on the Underground before. Staff were expected to send for the LFB only if the fire was out of control, dealing with it themselves if possible. Fires were described as &quot;smouldering&quot;, and staff had little or no training to deal with fires or evacuation.

==Legacy==
The publication of the report led to resignations of senior management of both London Underground and London Regional Transport (LRT), including Keith Bright, the chairman of LRT. Wooden panelling was to be removed from escalators, heat detectors and sprinklers were to be fitted beneath escalators, and the radio communication system and station staff emergency training were to be improved.

The Fire Precautions (Sub-surface Railway Stations) Regulations 1989 were introduced. Smoking was banned in all London Underground stations, including on the escalators, on 23 November, five days after the fire. Wooden escalators were gradually replaced, some remaining into the early 2000s (those at Wanstead were replaced in 2003 and at Marylebone in 2004,) and since 2014 the entire London Underground has been operating on metal escalators, after the last wooden escalator at Greenford on the Central line was decommissioned on 11 March 2014.

By 1997, the majority of the recommendations of the Fennell report had been implemented, with safety improvements including the removal of any hazardous materials, CCTV fitted in stations, installation of fire alarms and sensors and the issuing of personal radios to staff.

London Underground was also recommended by the Fennell Report to investigate &quot;passenger flow and congestion in stations and take remedial action&quot;. Consequently, parliamentary bills were tabled to permit London Underground to improve and expand the busiest and most congested stations, such as London Bridge, Tottenham Court Road, Holborn and King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras.

Since then, major tube stations have been upgraded and expanded to increase capacity and improve safety. London Bridge was upgraded in conjunction with the Jubilee Line Extension project, which opened in 1999, King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras was substantially upgraded and expanded as a component of the High Speed 1 project in the late 2000s, and Tottenham Court Road was expanded as part of the Crossrail project in the mid-2010s.

The fire also led to improvement in firefighters&#x27; equipment: yellow plastic leggings that melted in the heat and rubber gloves that limited movement were replaced with more effective clothing.

Six firemen received certificates of commendation for their actions at the fire, including Station Officer Townsley who was given the award posthumously. Townsley was also posthumously awarded the George Medal.

Soon after the fire a commemoration service was held at St Pancras Church. Further commemoration services were held on 18 November 2002, the 15th anniversary of the blaze, on the 20th anniversary in 2007 at the station itself, on the 25th anniversary in 2012 at the Church of the Blessed Sacrament near the station, and on the 30th anniversary in 2017 at the station, with the laying of a wreath.

Memorial plaques commemorating the disaster were installed at St Pancras Church, unveiled by Diana, Princess of Wales, and at King&#x27;s Cross station.

==In popular culture==
The Blue Zone single &quot;On Fire&quot;, with a young Lisa Stansfield on lead vocals, was hastily withdrawn from sale, stalling at No. 99 in the UK Singles Charts.

The Nick Lowe song &quot;Who Was That Man?&quot; from the 1990 album &quot;Party of One&quot; tells the story of the only then-unidentified victim of the King&#x27;s Cross Fire, identified in 2004 as Alexander Fallon.

Charles Duhigg in his 2012 book &quot;The Power of Habit&quot; discusses how bad corporate culture and inefficient management led to the disaster at King&#x27;s Cross.

The poem &quot;Tube Ride to Martha&#x27;s&quot; by Matthew Sweeney describes the final hours of a victim of the King&#x27;s Cross Fire.

<doc id="99258" wikidata="Q728001" url="?curid=99258" title="Morphological derivation">
<text>Morphological derivation, in linguistics, is the process of forming a new word from an existing word, often by adding a prefix or suffix, such as For example, &quot;unhappy&quot; and &quot;happiness&quot; derive from the root word &quot;happy.&quot;

It is differentiated from inflection, which is the modification of a word to form different grammatical categories without changing its core meaning: &quot;determines&quot;, &quot;determining&quot;, and &quot;determined&quot; are from the root &quot;determine&quot;.

==Derivational patterns==
Derivational morphology often involves the addition of a derivational suffix or other affix. Such an affix usually applies to words of one lexical category (part of speech) and changes them into words of another such category. For example, one effect of the English derivational suffix &quot;-ly&quot; is to change an adjective into an adverb (&quot;slow&quot; → &quot;slowly&quot;).

Here are examples of English derivational patterns and their suffixes:

* adjective-to-noun: &quot;-ness&quot; (&quot;slow&quot; → &quot;slowness&quot;)
* adjective-to-verb: &quot;-en&quot; (&quot;weak&quot; → &quot;weaken&quot;)
* adjective-to-adjective: &quot;-ish&quot; (&quot;red&quot; → &quot;reddish&quot;)
* adjective-to-adverb: &quot;-ly&quot; (&quot;personal&quot; → &quot;personally&quot;)
* noun-to-adjective: &quot;-al&quot; (&quot;recreation&quot; → &quot;recreational&quot;)
* noun-to-verb: &quot;-fy&quot; (&quot;glory&quot; → &quot;glorify&quot;)
* verb-to-adjective: &quot;-able&quot; (&quot;drink&quot; → &quot;drinkable&quot;)
* verb-to-noun (abstract): &quot;-ance&quot; (&quot;deliver&quot; → &quot;deliverance&quot;)
* verb-to-noun (agent): &quot;-er&quot; (&quot;write&quot; → &quot;writer&quot;)

However, derivational affixes do not necessarily alter the lexical category; they may change merely the meaning of the base and leave the category unchanged. A prefix (&quot;write&quot; → &quot; re-write&quot;; &quot;lord&quot; → &quot;over-lord&quot;) rarely changes the lexical category in English. The prefix &quot;un-&quot; applies to adjectives (&quot;healthy&quot; → &quot;unhealthy&quot;) and some verbs (&quot;do&quot; → &quot;undo&quot;) but rarely to nouns. A few exceptions are the derivational prefixes &quot;en-&quot; and &quot;be-&quot;. &quot;En-&quot; (replaced by &quot;em-&quot; before labials) is usually a transitive marker on verbs, but it can also be applied to adjectives and nouns to form transitive verbs: &quot;circle&quot; (verb) → &quot;encircle&quot; (verb) but &quot;rich&quot; (adj) → &quot;enrich&quot; (verb), &quot;large&quot; (adj) → &quot;enlarge&quot; (verb), &quot;rapture&quot; (noun) → &quot;enrapture&quot; (verb), &quot;slave&quot; (noun) → &quot;enslave&quot; (verb).

When derivation occurs without any change to the word, such as in the conversion of the noun &quot;breakfast&quot; into the verb &quot;to breakfast&quot;, it&#x27;s known as conversion, or zero derivation.

Derivation that results in a noun may be called nominalization. It may involve the use of an affix (such as with &quot;employ → employee&quot;), or it may occur via conversion (such as with the derivation of the noun &quot;run&quot; from the verb &quot;to run&quot;). In contrast, a derivation resulting in a verb may be called verbalization (such as from the noun &quot;butter&quot; to the verb &quot;to butter&quot;).

Some words have specific exceptions to these patterns. For example, &quot;inflammable&quot; actually means &quot;flammable,&quot; and &quot;de-evolution&quot; is spelled with only one &quot;e,&quot; as &quot;devolution.&quot;

==Derivation and inflection==
Derivation can be contrasted with inflection, in that derivation produces a new word (a distinct lexeme), whereas inflection produces grammatical variants (or forms) of the same word.

Generally speaking, inflection applies in more or less regular patterns to all members of a part of speech (for example, nearly every English verb adds &quot;-s&quot; for the third person singular present tense), while derivation follows less consistent patterns (for example, the nominalizing suffix &quot;-ity&quot; can be used with the adjectives &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;dense&quot;, but not with &quot;open&quot; or &quot;strong&quot;). However, derivations and inflections can share homonyms, that being, morphemes that have the different sound, but not the same meaning. For example, when the affix &quot;-er&quot; is added to an adjective, as in &quot;small-er&quot;, it acts as an inflection, but when added to a verb, as in &quot;cook-er&quot;, it acts as a derivation.

A derivation can produce a lexeme with a different part of speech but does not necessarily. For example, the derivation of the word &quot;uncommon&quot; from &quot;common&quot; + &quot;un-&quot; (a derivational morpheme) does not change its part of speech (both are adjectives).

An important distinction between derivational and inflectional morphology lies in the content/function of a listeme. Derivational morphology changes both the meaning and the content of a listeme, while inflectional morphology doesn&#x27;t change the meaning, but changes the function.

A non-exhaustive list of derivational morphemes in English: &quot;-ful, -able, im-, un-, -ing, -er.&quot;

A non-exhaustive list of inflectional morphemes in English: &quot;-er, -est, -ing, -en, -ed, -s.&quot;

==Derivation and other types of word formation==
Derivation can be contrasted with other types of word formation such as compounding.

Derivational affixes are bound morphemes – they are meaningful units, but can only normally occur when attached to another word. In that respect, derivation differs from compounding by which &quot;free&quot; morphemes are combined (&quot;lawsuit&quot;, &quot;Latin professor&quot;). It also differs from inflection in that inflection does not create new lexemes but new word forms (&quot;table&quot; → &quot;tables&quot;; &quot;open&quot; → &quot;opened&quot;).

==Productivity==
Derivational patterns differ in the degree to which they can be called productive. A productive pattern or affix is one that is commonly used to produce novel forms. For example, the negating prefix &quot;un-&quot; is more productive in English than the alternative &quot;in-&quot;; both of them occur in established words (such as &quot;unusual&quot; and &quot;inaccessible&quot;), but faced with a new word which does not have an established negation, a native speaker is more likely to create a novel form with &quot;un-&quot; than with &quot;in-&quot;. The same thing happens with suffixes. For example, if comparing two words &quot;Thatcherite&quot; and &quot;Thatcherist&quot;, the analysis shows that both suffixes &quot;-ite&quot; and &quot;-ist&quot; are productive and can be added to proper names, moreover, both derived adjectives are established and have the same meaning. But the suffix &quot;-ist&quot; is more productive and, thus, can be found more often in word formation not only from proper names.

<doc id="99260" wikidata="Q170292" url="?curid=99260" title="Classicism">
<text>Classicism, in the arts, refers generally to a high regard for a classical period, classical antiquity in the Western tradition, as setting standards for taste which the classicists seek to emulate. In its purest form, classicism is an aesthetic attitude dependent on principles based in the culture, art and literature of ancient Greece and Rome, with the emphasis on form, simplicity, proportion, clarity of structure, perfection and restrained emotion, as well as explicit appeal to the intellect. The art of classicism typically seeks to be formal and restrained: of the &quot;Discobolus&quot; Sir Kenneth Clark observed, &quot;if we object to his restraint and compression we are simply objecting to the classicism of classic art. A violent emphasis or a sudden acceleration of rhythmic movement would have destroyed those qualities of balance and completeness through which it retained until the present century its position of authority in the restricted repertoire of visual images.&quot; Classicism, as Clark noted, implies a canon of widely accepted ideal forms, whether in the Western canon that he was examining in &quot;The Nude&quot; (1956).

Classicism is a force which is often present in post-medieval European and European influenced traditions; however, some periods felt themselves more connected to the classical ideals than others, particularly the Age of Enlightenment, when Neoclassicism was an important movement in the visual arts.

==General term==
Classicism is a specific genre of philosophy, expressing itself in literature, architecture, art, and music, which has Ancient Greek and Roman sources and an emphasis on society. It was particularly expressed in the Neoclassicism of the Age of Enlightenment.

Classicism is a recurrent tendency in the Late Antique period, and had a major revival in Carolingian and Ottonian art. There was another, more durable revival in the Italian Renaissance when the fall of Byzantium and rising trade with the Islamic cultures brought a flood of knowledge about, and from, the antiquity of Europe. Until that time, the identification with antiquity had been seen as a continuous history of Christendom from the conversion of Roman Emperor Constantine I. Renaissance classicism introduced a host of elements into European culture, including the application of mathematics and empiricism into art, humanism, literary and depictive realism, and formalism. Importantly it also introduced Polytheism, or &quot;paganism&quot; , and the juxtaposition of ancient and modern.

The classicism of the Renaissance led to, and gave way to, a different sense of what was &quot;classical&quot; in the 16th and 17th centuries. In this period, classicism took on more overtly structural overtones of orderliness, predictability, the use of geometry and grids, the importance of rigorous discipline and pedagogy, as well as the formation of schools of art and music. The court of Louis XIV was seen as the center of this form of classicism, with its references to the gods of Olympus as a symbolic prop for absolutism, its adherence to axiomatic and deductive reasoning, and its love of order and predictability.

This period sought the revival of classical art forms, including Greek drama and music. Opera, in its modern European form, had its roots in attempts to recreate the combination of singing and dancing with theatre thought to be the Greek norm. Examples of this appeal to classicism included Dante, Petrarch, and Shakespeare in poetry and theatre. Tudor drama, in particular, modeled itself after classical ideals and divided works into Tragedy and Comedy. Studying Ancient Greek became regarded as essential for a well-rounded education in the liberal arts.

The Renaissance also explicitly returned to architectural models and techniques associated with Greek and Roman antiquity, including the golden rectangle as a key proportion for buildings, the classical orders of columns, as well as a host of ornament and detail associated with Greek and Roman architecture. They also began reviving plastic arts such as bronze casting for sculpture, and used the classical naturalism as the foundation of drawing, painting and sculpture.

The Age of Enlightenment identified itself with a vision of antiquity which, while continuous with the classicism of the previous century, was shaken by the physics of Sir Isaac Newton, the improvements in machinery and measurement, and a sense of liberation which they saw as being present in the Greek civilization, particularly in its struggles against the Persian Empire. The ornate, organic, and complexly integrated forms of the baroque were to give way to a series of movements that regarded themselves expressly as &quot;classical&quot; or &quot;neo-classical&quot;, or would rapidly be labelled as such. For example, the painting of Jacques-Louis David was seen as an attempt to return to formal balance, clarity, manliness, and vigor in art.

The 19th century saw the classical age as being the precursor of academicism, including such movements as uniformitarianism in the sciences, and the creation of rigorous categories in artistic fields. Various movements of the Romantic period saw themselves as classical revolts against a prevailing trend of emotionalism and irregularity, for example the Pre-Raphaelites. By this point, classicism was old enough that previous classical movements received revivals; for example, the Renaissance was seen as a means to combine the organic medieval with the orderly classical. The 19th century continued or extended many classical programs in the sciences, most notably the Newtonian program to account for the movement of energy between bodies by means of exchange of mechanical and thermal energy.

The 20th century saw a number of changes in the arts and sciences. Classicism was used both by those who rejected, or saw as temporary, transfigurations in the political, scientific, and social world and by those who embraced the changes as a means to overthrow the perceived weight of the 19th century. Thus, both pre-20th century disciplines were labelled &quot;classical&quot; and modern movements in art which saw themselves as aligned with light, space, sparseness of texture, and formal coherence.

In the present day philosophy classicism is used as a term particularly in relation to Apollonian over Dionysian impulses in society and art; that is a preference for rationality, or at least rationally guided catharsis, over emotionalism.

==In the theatre==

Classicism in the theatre was developed by 17th century French playwrights from what they judged to be the rules of Greek classical theatre, including the &quot;Classical unities&quot; of time, place and action, found in the &quot;Poetics&quot; of Aristotle.

* Unity of time referred to the need for the entire action of the play to take place in a fictional 24-hour period
* Unity of place meant that the action should unfold in a single location
* Unity of action meant that the play should be constructed around a single &#x27;plot-line&#x27;, such as a tragic love affair or a conflict between honour and duty.

Examples of classicist playwrights are Pierre Corneille, Jean Racine and Molière. In the period of Romanticism, Shakespeare, who conformed to none of the classical rules, became the focus of French argument over them, in which the Romantics eventually triumphed; Victor Hugo was among the first French playwrights to break these conventions.

The influence of these French rules on playwrights in other nations is debatable. In the English theatre, Restoration playwrights such as William Wycherley and William Congreve would have been familiar with them. William Shakespeare and his contemporaries did not follow this Classicist philosophy, in particular since they were not French and also because they wrote several decades prior to their establishment. Those of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays that seem to display the unities, such as &quot;The Tempest&quot;, probably indicate a familiarity with actual models from classical antiquity.

Most famous 18th-century Italian playwright and libretist Carlo Goldoni created a hybrid style of playwriting (combining the model of Molière with the strengths of Commedia dell&#x27;arte and his own wit and sincerity).

==In literature==
The literary classicism drew inspiration from the qualities of proportion of the major works of ancient Greek and Latin literature.

The 17th–18th centuries significant Classical writers (principally, playwrights and poets) include Pierre Corneille, Jean Racine, John Dryden, William Wycherley, William Congreve, Jonathan Swift, Joseph Addison, Alexander Pope, Voltaire, Carlo Goldoni, and Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock.

==In architecture==
Classicism in architecture developed during the Italian Renaissance, notably in the writings and designs of Leon Battista Alberti and the work of Filippo Brunelleschi. It places emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts as they are demonstrated in the architecture of Classical antiquity and, in particular, the architecture of Ancient Rome, of which many examples remained.

Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aedicules replaced the more complex proportional systems and irregular profiles of medieval buildings. This style quickly spread to other Italian cities and then to France, Germany, England, Russia and elsewhere.

In the 16th century, Sebastiano Serlio helped codify the classical orders and Andrea Palladio&#x27;s legacy evolved into the long tradition of Palladian architecture. Building off of these influences, the 17th-century architects Inigo Jones and Christopher Wren firmly established classicism in England.

For the development of classicism from the mid-18th-century onwards, see Neoclassical architecture.

==In the fine arts==
* &quot;For Greek art of the 5th century B.C.E., see Classical art in ancient Greece and the Severe style&quot;

Italian Renaissance painting and sculpture are marked by their renewal of classical forms, motifs and subjects. In the 15th century Leon Battista Alberti was important in theorizing many of the ideas for painting that came to a fully realized product with Raphael&#x27;s &quot;School of Athens&quot; during the High Renaissance. The themes continued largely unbroken into the 17th century, when artists such as Nicolas Poussin and Charles Le Brun represented of the more rigid classicism. Like Italian classicizing ideas in the 15th and 16th centuries, it spread through Europe in the mid to late 17th century.

Later classicism in painting and sculpture from the mid-18th and 19th centuries is generally referred to as Neoclassicism.

==Political philosophy==
Classicism in political philosophy dates back to the ancient Greeks. Western political philosophy is often attributed to the great Greek philosopher Plato. Although political theory of this time starts with Plato, it quickly becomes complex when Plato&#x27;s pupil, Aristotle, formulates his own ideas. &quot;The political theories of both philosophers are closely tied to their ethical theories, and their interest is in questions concerning constitutions or forms of government.&quot;

However, Plato and Aristotle are not the seedbed but simply the seeds that grew from a seedbed of political predecessors who had debated this topic for centuries before their time. For example, Herodotus sketched out a debate between Theseus, a king of the time, and Creon&#x27;s messenger. The debate simply shows proponents of democracy, monarchy, and oligarchy and how they all feel about these forms of government. Herodotus&#x27; sketch is just one of the beginning seedbeds for which Plato and Aristotle grew their own political theories.

Another Greek philosopher who was pivotal in the development of Classical political philosophy was Socrates. Although he was not a theory-builder, he often stimulated fellow citizens with paradoxes that challenged them to reflect on their own beliefs. Socrates thought &quot;the values that ought to determine how individuals live their lives should also shape the political life of the community.&quot; he believed the people of Athens involved wealth and money too much into the politics of their city. He judged the citizens for the way they amassed wealth and power over simple things like projects for their community.

Just like Plato and Aristotle, Socrates did not come up with these ideas alone. Socrates ideals stem back from Protagoras and other &#x27;sophists&#x27;. These &#x27;teachers of political arts&#x27; were the first to think and act as Socrates did. Where the two diverge is in the way they practiced their ideals. Protagoras&#x27; ideals were loved by Athens. Whereas Socrates challenged and pushed the citizens and he was not as loved.

In the end, ancient Greece is to be credited with the foundation of Classical political philosophy.

<text>Zonker Harris (his full name is revealed in &quot;Doonesbury: A Musical Comedy&quot; to be Edgar Zonker Harris) is the stereotypical unfocused confused hippie character in Garry Trudeau&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Doonesbury&quot;. He made his first appearance as a perennial pot-smoking pest plaguing B.D.&#x27;s football team in 1971. He moved with Mike, B.D., and the gang to a rural commune (named Walden in homage to Thoreau&#x27;s 19th century idyll).

==Family==
Zonker&#x27;s family consists of his mother, father, &quot;Uncle&quot; Duke, his nephew Zipper, and his sister, Louise. His mother and father have a habit of fighting, which leads to the mother leaving for a short time to clear her head (but always returning in time to water the plants). Whenever this happens, Zonker&#x27;s father becomes upset and visits Zonker, within minutes of the argument. Although Zonker&#x27;s sister never appears in the series, she is the mother of Zipper Harris, Zonker&#x27;s nephew.

Zonker&#x27;s ancestors from Colonial America are mentioned several times in the series. Nathan Harris was a minuteman (who could literally be ready in one minute) as well as an activist for civil rights and was responsible for &quot;freeing&quot; a nearby slave (who was under the impression that they were in Virginia, where slavery was still legal. They were, in fact, in Massachusetts). Nathan&#x27;s wife, Amy Harris, was equally revolutionary, fighting for women&#x27;s equality in the Constitution and taking up an apprenticeship with Paul Revere to become a silversmith. Neither cause worked out very well however, as men were not interested in women&#x27;s civil rights and she was unable to even cast simple pewter tankards. She quits her apprenticeship when Nathan assures her that he needs her as a companion and equal as well as a wife.

==History==

While at Walden Commune, Zonker spent most of his time watching TV, getting high, and swimming around in a minuscule body of water called &quot;Walden Puddle&quot;, which he considered to be a sacred and holy place. In his early years in the strip, Zonker had the ability to talk to plants. (Mike also talked to the plants during Zonker&#x27;s stint as Lieutenant Governor of American Samoa.) In later stories, Zonker appeared to lose this ability, but it has sprung back up occasionally, and he has been seen conversing with a marijuana plant, and a scrawny Christmas tree in recent years. Other than these few exceptions, this power seems to have left him, and he misses it terribly. When wondering out loud why he had it in the first place, he was told &quot;It was the drugs, man&quot;. Ironically, it was a plant that informed him of this.

Zonker is habitually unemployed, and is very protective of his slacker lifestyle. He has taken on temporary jobs as a bartender and a postman, but always leaves these careers as soon as he gets bored with them. The only &quot;work&quot; to which he has shown any diligence is acquiring a suntan. Throughout the 1980s, he spent more and more of his time trying to develop &quot;the perfect tan&quot;, and even became a celebrity (on par with a professional athlete) for his accomplishments, with George Hamilton as his idol. Eventually he wised up to the damage the sun was doing to his skin, and has since appeared in public service announcements about sun safety.

After his graduation from Walden, Zonker eventually enrolled in &quot;The Baby Doc College of Physicians&quot; (which was run by Uncle Duke, an old family friend). However, he dropped out after winning $23 million from a lottery ticket. Shortly afterward, he had to spend most of it on saving Duke from being a zombified slave, but had enough left over to buy a British title (His Lordship the Viscount St. Austell-in-the-Moor Biggleswade-Brixham), which caused him to be called to England as a tie-breaker for a vote in the House of Lords over one of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s tax bills. He stayed at another lord&#x27;s castle for several months, oblivious to many not-so-subtle hints to leave, and was eventually forcibly removed by a butler. He ended up as a live-in nanny for Mike and J.J. Doonesbury (who kicked him out in the early 1990s).

==Lifestyle==
Zonker spent several years as a live-in babysitter for B.D. and Boopsie&#x27;s daughter Samantha in Connecticut. As they live on the former Walden Commune, Zonker was reunited with his beloved puddle. He contributed to the household by working at &quot;McFriendly&#x27;s&quot;, apparently a portmanteau of McDonald&#x27;s and Friendly&#x27;s restaurants.

In 2012, with the legalization of marijuana in Colorado, Zonker and his nephew Zipper began to conceive a plan to move to Boulder and start a marijuana farm. They did this in early 2014.

Occasionally he travels back to his birthplace of California to commune with &quot;Old Surfer Dude&quot;, an elderly man who preaches the virtues of the surfer lifestyle in a style reminiscent of both a kung fu master and Yoda. He has been in conflict for many years with David Geffen for denying the public access to his beaches, in conflict with California law. Geffen finally relented in 2005. There is an access way in Malibu named after Zonker.

Zonker is entirely uninterested in sex and romance and has never pursued a romantic relationship. He claims that this is because his heart was broken by a girl when he was ten years old, and that this convinced him that love was not worth the trouble.

Zonker often supports political causes that are out of the mainstream. Zonker voted for Ross Perot in 1992 and worked for his Uncle Duke&#x27;s 2000 presidential campaign. In a March 2010 strip, he told a Tea Party supporter that he has &quot;always stuck it to the man&quot;.

Wesleyan University students hold an unofficial yearly event in April called Zonker Harris Day, celebrating psychedelic music and culture, with the Doonesbury character as a mascot. MGMT are among the acts to have performed at Zonker Harris Day: in 2003, while the members were undergraduates at Wesleyan, the band performed a set including a version of their later hit &quot;Kids&quot;. In early 2008, the new Wesleyan University president, Michael S. Roth, declared Zonker Harris Day to be &quot;stupid&quot;, and the Residential Life office officially opposed its &quot;hippie-druggie&quot; image. Funding for the event was banned pending a new title. After prolonged disagreement, students renamed the event &quot;Ze Who Shall Not Be Named Day&quot;. With a new name, the former Zonker Harris Day was held as usual on April 19, 2008. The students protested what they viewed to be unnecessary and irrelevant censorship, while the administration maintained that Zonker Harris Day gave the university a poor image. A series of strips in late 2010 parodied this, with Zonker (having been told of the event&#x27;s renaming) debating whether or not to personally intervene, especially in light of the major conflict on his calendar in April – the Royal Wedding of Prince William. In 2011, the name of the festival was reinstated.

The University of Miami named the scout team the Zonkers.

<doc id="99277" wikidata="Q1424956" url="?curid=99277" title="Neuroleptic malignant syndrome">
<text>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare but life-threatening reaction that can occur in response to antipsychotics (neuroleptic) or other drugs that block the effects of dopamine. Symptoms include high fever, confusion, rigid muscles, variable blood pressure, sweating, and fast heart rate. Complications may include muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), high blood potassium, kidney failure, or seizures.
Any medications within the family of antipsychotics can cause the condition, though typical antipsychotics appear to have a higher risk than atypicals, specifically first generation antipsychotics like haloperidol. Onset is often within a few weeks of starting the medication but can occur at any time. Risk factors include dehydration, agitation, and catatonia.

Rapidly decreasing the use of levodopa or other dopamine agonists, such as pramipexole, may also trigger the condition. The underlying mechanism involves blockage of dopamine receptors. Diagnosis is based on symptoms.
Management includes stopping the triggering medication, rapid cooling, and starting other medications. Medications used include dantrolene, bromocriptine, and diazepam. The risk of death among those affected is about 10%. Rapid diagnosis and treatment is required to improve outcomes. Many people can eventually be restarted on a lower dose of antipsychotic.
As of 2011, among those in psychiatric hospitals on antipsychotics about 15 per 100,000 are affected per year (0.015%). In the second half of the 20th century rates were over 100 times higher at about 2% (2,000 per 100,000). Males appear to be more often affected than females. The condition was first described in 1956.

==Signs and symptoms==
NMS symptoms include:
* Increased body temperature &gt;38 °C (&gt;100.4 °F)
* Confused or altered consciousness
* Excessive sweating
* Severely rigid muscles
* Autonomic imbalance

The first symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome are usually muscle cramps and tremors, fever, symptoms of autonomic nervous system instability such as unstable blood pressure, and sudden changes in mental status (agitation, delirium, or coma). Other possible symptoms include sweating, trouble swallowing, tremors, incontinence, and mutism. Once symptoms appear, they may progress rapidly and reach peak intensity in as little as three days. These symptoms can last anywhere from eight hours to forty days, with the median duration of symptoms, with treatment, being nine days. The median onset of symptoms is four days after initiating the offending medication, but in some cases symptoms may begin up to 30 days later.

Symptoms are sometimes misinterpreted by doctors as symptoms of mental illness which can result in delayed treatment. Symptoms may also be mistaken for similarly presenting conditions such as malignant hyperthermia, serotonin syndrome, or withdrawal from illicit drugs such as alcohol, cocaine, or MDMA.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) usually presents with a &quot;lead pipe rigidity&quot; in which the muscles are stiffened and resistance is observed throughout the range of motion on testing. Severe cases may present as catatonia in which the person is not responsive to stimuli.

The deep tendon reflexes in NMS are usually preserved whereas in serotonin syndrome presents with myoclonus or hyperactive muscle reflexes.

==Causes==
NMS is usually caused by antipsychotic drug use, but other dopaminergic blocking drugs can also be a cause. Individuals using butyrophenones (such as haloperidol and droperidol) or phenothiazines (such as promethazine and chlorpromazine) are reported to be at greatest risk. However, various atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone have also been implicated in cases.

NMS may also occur in people taking dopaminergic drugs (such as levodopa) for Parkinson&#x27;s disease, most often when the drug dosage is abruptly reduced. In addition, other drugs with anti-dopaminergic activity, such as the antiemetic metoclopramide, can induce NMS. Tetracyclics with anti-dopaminergic activity have been linked to NMS in case reports, such as the amoxapines. Additionally, desipramine, dothiepin, phenelzine, tetrabenazine, and reserpine have been known to trigger NMS. Whether lithium can cause NMS is unclear. However, concomitant use of lithium is associated with a higher risk of NMS when a person starts on an antipsychotic drug.

At the molecular level, NMS is caused by a sudden, marked reduction in dopamine activity, either from withdrawal of dopaminergic agents or blockade of dopamine receptors.

===Risk factors===
The use of antipsychotics as well as how this class of medications is used is one of the most common risk factors for NMS. Use of high-potency antipsychotics, a rapid increase in the dosage of antipsychotics, use of long-acting forms of antipsychotics (such as haloperidol) or injectable formulations, or using multiple antipsychotics are all known to increase the risk of developing NMS. Dehydration is a risk factor for the development of NMS. There appears to be no relationship between duration of therapy and the development of NMS.

Use of the following agents is most commonly associated with the development of NMS:
* Typical antipsychotics: e.g. haloperidol, chlorpromazine. 
* Anti-dopaminergic antiemetics: e.g. droperidol 
* Withdrawal of dopaminergic agents: e.g. levodopa, amantadine

It has been purported that there is a genetic risk factor for NMS. In one study, identical twins presented with NMS, and a mother and two of her daughters have presented with NMS in another case.

Demographically, it appears that males, especially those under forty, are at greatest risk for developing NMS, although it is unclear if the increased incidence is a result of greater antipsychotic use in men under forty. It has also been suggested that postpartum women may be at a greater risk for NMS.

Antipsychotic use in those with Lewy body dementia is a risk factor for NMS. These people are extremely sensitive to antipsychotics. As a result, antipsychotics should be used cautiously in all cases of dementia.

==Pathophysiology==
The mechanism is commonly thought to depend on decreased levels of dopamine activity due to:
* Dopamine receptor blockade
* Genetically reduced function of dopamine receptor D2
*Sympathoadrenal hyperactivity and autonomic dysfunction

It has been proposed that blockade of D2-like (D2, D3 and D4) receptors induce massive glutamate release, generating catatonia, neurotoxicity and myotoxicity. Additionally, the blockade of diverse serotonin receptors by atypical antipsychotics and activation of 5-HT1 receptors by certain of them reduces GABA release and indirectly induces glutamate release, worsening this syndrome.

The muscular symptoms are most likely caused by blockade of the dopamine receptor D2, leading to abnormal function of the basal ganglia similar to that seen in Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

In the past, research and clinical studies seemed to corroborate the D2 receptor blockade theory in which antipsychotic drugs were thought to significantly reduce dopamine activity by blocking the D2 receptors associated with this neurotransmitter. The introduction of atypical antipsychotic drugs, with lower affinity to the D2 dopamine receptors, was thought to have reduced the incidence of NMS. However, recent studies suggest that the decrease in mortality may be the result of increased physician awareness and earlier initiation of treatment rather than the action of the drugs themselves. NMS induced by atypical drugs also resembles &quot;classical&quot; NMS (induced by &quot;typical&quot; antipsychotic drugs), further casting doubt on the overall superiority of these drugs.

However, the failure of D2 dopamine receptor antagonism, or dopamine receptor dysfunction, do not fully explain the presenting symptoms and signs of NMS, as well as the occurrence of NMS with atypical antipsychotic drugs with lower D2 dopamine activity. This has led to the hypothesis of sympathoadrenal hyperactivity (results from removing tonic inhibition from the sympathetic nervous system) as a mechanism for NMS. Release of calcium is increased from the sarcoplasmic reticulum with antipsychotic usage. This can result in increased muscle contractility, which can play a role in the breakdown of muscle, muscle rigidity, and hyperthermia. Some antipsychotic drugs, such as typical antipsychotics, are known to block dopamine receptors; other studies have shown that when drugs supplying dopamine are withdrawn, symptoms similar to NMS present themselves.

In support of the sympathoadrenal hyperactivity model, it has been hypothesized that a defect in calcium regulatory proteins within the sympathetic neurons may bring about the onset of NMS. This model of NMS strengthens its suspected association with malignant hyperthermia in which NMS may be regarded as a neurogenic form of this condition which itself is linked to defective calcium-related proteins.

There is also thought to be considerable overlap between malignant catatonia and NMS in their pathophysiology, the former being idiopathic and the latter being the drug-induced form of the same syndrome.

The raised white blood cell count and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) plasma concentration seen in those with NMS is due to increased muscular activity and rhabdomyolysis (destruction of muscle tissue). Someone may experience hypertensive crisis and metabolic acidosis.

The fever seen with NMS is believed to be caused by hypothalamic dopamine receptor blockade. Antipsychotics cause an increased calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells which can result in rigidity and eventual cell breakdown. No major studies have reported an explanation for the abnormal EEG, but it is likely also attributable to dopamine blockage leading to changes in neuronal pathways.

==Diagnosis==
===Differential diagnosis===
Due to the comparative rarity of NMS, it is often overlooked. Immediate treatment for the syndrome should not be delayed as it has a high mortality of between 10-20%. Differentiating NMS from other neurological disorders can be very difficult.

The diagnosis is suggested on patients with a history of drug exposure to the most common inducing agents such as strong antidopaminergic medications. The differential diagnosis includes serotonin syndrome, encephalitis, toxic encephalopathy, status epilepticus, heat stroke, catatonia and malignant hyperthermia. Drugs such as cocaine and amphetamine may also produce similar symptoms. Features which distinguish NMS from serotonin syndrome include bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, and a high white blood cell count.

==Treatment==
NMS is a medical emergency and can lead to death if untreated. The first step is to stop the culprit medication and treat the hyperthermia aggressively, such as with cooling blankets or ice packs to the axillae and groin. Acetaminophen is commonly used as an anti-pyretic. Supportive care in an intensive care unit capable of circulatory and ventilatory support is crucial. In those unable to control their secretions, or who have muscle spams of the respiratory muscles, mechanical ventilation may be needed. 

The best pharmacological treatment is still unclear. Dantrolene has been used when needed to reduce muscle rigidity, and dopamine pathway medications such as bromocriptine have shown benefit. Dantrolene may act centrally on thermoregulatory pathways to lower the temperature. Dantrolene also inhibits calcium release from the muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum to cause muscle relaxation.
Amantadine is another treatment option due to its dopaminergic and anticholinergic effects.
Apomorphine may be used however its use is supported by little evidence. Benzodiazepines may be used to control . Highly elevated blood myoglobin levels from muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis) can result in kidney damage, therefore aggressive intravenous hydration with diuresis may be required. When recognized early NMS can be successfully managed; however, up to 10% of cases can be fatal.

Should the affected person subsequently require an antipsychotic, trialing a low dose of a low-potency atypical antipsychotic is recommended.

Electroconvulsive therapy may be used in life threatening cases of NMS that are refractory to first line treatments.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis is best when identified early and treated aggressively. In earlier studies the mortality rates of NMS ranged from 20%–38%, but by 2009 mortality rates were reported to have fallen below 10% over the previous two decades due to early recognition and improvements in management. Re-introduction of antipsychotics after NMS may trigger a recurrence, although in most cases it does not. With recurrence rate being 4.2% in a small, population based study.

==Epidemiology==
Pooled data suggest the incidence of NMS is between 0.2%–3.23%. However, greater awareness coupled with increased use of atypical anti-psychotics have likely reduced the prevalence of NMS. Additionally, young males are particularly susceptible and the male to female ratio has been reported to be as high as 2:1.

==History==
NMS was known about as early as 1956, shortly after the introduction of the first phenothiazines. NMS was first described in 1960 by French clinicians who had been working on a study involving haloperidol. They characterized the condition that was associated with the side effects of haloperidol &quot;syndrome malin des neuroleptiques&quot;, which was translated to neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

<text>East Donegal Township is a township in northwestern Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 8,690.

==History==
It is named after County Donegal, Ireland. The original township of Donegal was organized by the court of Chester County in 1722, and was one of the two townships which composed Lancaster County at the time of its erection in 1729. On June 24, 1838, a division was effected, whereby the old township was constituted into two townships, to be separately and distinctly recognized as East Donegal and West Donegal.

The settlers of East Donegal were of Scots-Irish descent and were primarily farmers who were drawn to the area by the rich soils and plentiful streams. Thus the abundant produce provided by the land was able to be made into flour by the many mills which sprang up in the area.

Early settlers, Arthur Patterson and others, organized a Presbyterian Church at Donegal in 1726, and erected the old church edifice at that time. The first three pastors of it were from Scotland. Bartram Galbraith, grandson of James Galbraith, was Lieutenant for Lancaster County, the first three years of the Revolution, and many members of that family served in various official positions, as also did Alexander Lowrey and several of that family.

The Chickies Historic District, Donegal Presbyterian Church Complex, Grove Mansion, Donegal Mills Plantation, Byers-Muma House, and Cameron Estate are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="99293" wikidata="Q1647152" url="?curid=99293" title="Shape of the universe">
<text>In physical cosmology, the shape of the universe refers to both its local and global geometry. Local geometry is defined primarily by its curvature, while the global geometry is characterised by its topology (which itself is constrained by curvature). General relativity explains how spatial curvature (local geometry) is constrained by gravity. The global topology of the universe cannot be deduced from measurements of curvature inferred from observations within the family of homogeneous general relativistic models alone, due to the existence of locally indistinguishable spaces with varying global topological characteristics. For example; a multiply connected space like a 3 torus has everywhere zero curvature but is finite in extent, whereas a flat simply connected space is infinite in extent (such as Euclidean space).

Current observational evidence (WMAP, BOOMERanG, and Planck for example) imply that the observable universe is spatially flat to within a 0.4% margin of error of the curvature density parameter with an unknown global topology. It is currently unknown whether the universe is simply connected like euclidean space or multiply connected like a torus. To date, no compelling evidence has been found suggesting the topology of the universe is not simply connected, though it has not been ruled out by astronomical observations.

== Shape of the observable universe ==

The universe&#x27;s structure can be examined from two angles:
# Local geometry: This relates to the curvature of the universe, primarily concerning what we can observe.
# Global geometry: This pertains to the universe&#x27;s overall shape and structure.
The observable universe (of a given current observer) is a roughly spherical region extending about 46 billion light-years in all directions (from that observer, the observer being the current Earth, unless specified otherwise). It appears older and more redshifted the deeper we look into space. In theory, we could look all the way back to the Big Bang, but in practice, we can only see up to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) (roughly years after the Big Bang) as anything beyond that is opaque. Studies show that the observable universe is isotropic and homogeneous on the largest scales.

If the observable universe encompasses the entire universe, we might determine its structure through observation. However, if the observable universe is smaller, we can only grasp a portion of it, making it impossible to deduce the global geometry through observation. Different mathematical models of the universe&#x27;s global geometry can be constructed, all consistent with current observations and general relativity. Hence, it is unclear whether the observable universe matches the entire universe or is significantly smaller, though it is generally accepted that the universe is larger than the observable universe.

The universe may be compact in some dimensions and not in others, similar to how a cuboid is longer in one dimension than the others. Scientists test these models by looking for novel implications – phenomena not yet observed but necessary if the model is accurate. For instance, a small closed universe would produce multiple images of the same object in the sky, though not necessarily of the same age. As of 2024, current observational evidence suggests that the observable universe is spatially flat with an unknown global structure.

== Curvature of the universe ==
The curvature is a quantity describing how the geometry of a space differs locally from flat space. The curvature of any locally isotropic space (and hence of a locally isotropic universe) falls into one of the three following cases:
# Zero curvature (flat)a drawn triangle&#x27;s angles add up to 180° and the Pythagorean theorem holds; such 3-dimensional space is locally modeled by Euclidean space .
# Positive curvaturea drawn triangle&#x27;s angles add up to more than 180°; such 3-dimensional space is locally modeled by a region of a 3-sphere .
# Negative curvaturea drawn triangle&#x27;s angles add up to less than 180°; such 3-dimensional space is locally modeled by a region of a hyperbolic space .

Curved geometries are in the domain of non-Euclidean geometry. An example of a positively curved space would be the surface of a sphere such as the Earth. A triangle drawn from the equator to a pole will have at least two angles equal 90°, which makes the sum of the 3 angles greater than 180°. An example of a negatively curved surface would be the shape of a saddle or mountain pass. A triangle drawn on a saddle surface will have the sum of the angles adding up to less than 180°.

General relativity explains that mass and energy bend the curvature of spacetime and is used to determine what curvature the universe has by using a value called the density parameter, represented with Omega (). The density parameter is the average density of the universe divided by the critical energy density, that is, the mass energy needed for a universe to be flat. Put another way,
* If , the universe is flat.
* If , there is positive curvature.
* If , there is negative curvature.

Scientists could experimentally calculate to determine the curvature two ways. One is to count all the mass–energy in the universe and take its average density, then divide that average by the critical energy density. Data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) as well as the Planck spacecraft give values for the three constituents of all the mass–energy in the universe – normal mass (baryonic matter and dark matter), relativistic particles (predominantly photons and neutrinos), and dark energy or the cosmological constant:
: Ωmass ≈ 
: Ωrelativistic ≈ 
: ΩΛ ≈ 
: Ωtotal = Ωmass + Ωrelativistic + ΩΛ = 
The actual value for critical density value is measured as &quot;ρ&quot;critical = . From these values, within experimental error, the universe seems to be spatially flat.

Another way to measure Ω is to do so geometrically by measuring an angle across the observable universe. This can be done by using the CMB and measuring the power spectrum and temperature anisotropy. For instance, one can imagine finding a gas cloud that is not in thermal equilibrium due to being so large that light speed cannot propagate the thermal information. Knowing this propagation speed, we then know the size of the gas cloud as well as the distance to the gas cloud, we then have two sides of a triangle and can then determine the angles. Using a method similar to this, the BOOMERanG experiment has determined that the sum of the angles to 180° within experimental error, corresponding to .

These and other astronomical measurements constrain the spatial curvature to be very close to zero, although they do not constrain its sign. This means that although the local geometries of spacetime are generated by the theory of relativity based on spacetime intervals, we can approximate &quot;3-space&quot; by the familiar Euclidean geometry.

The Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) model using Friedmann equations is commonly used to model the universe. The FLRW model provides a curvature of the universe based on the mathematics of fluid dynamics, that is, modeling the matter within the universe as a perfect fluid. Although stars and structures of mass can be introduced into an &quot;almost FLRW&quot; model, a strictly FLRW model is used to approximate the local geometry of the observable universe. Another way of saying this is that, if all forms of dark energy are ignored, then the curvature of the universe can be determined by measuring the average density of matter within it, assuming that all matter is evenly distributed (rather than the distortions caused by &#x27;dense&#x27; objects such as galaxies). This assumption is justified by the observations that, while the universe is &quot;weakly&quot; inhomogeneous and anisotropic (see the large-scale structure of the cosmos), it is on average homogeneous and isotropic when analyzed at a sufficiently large spatial scale.

== Global universal structure ==
Global structure covers the geometry and the topology of the whole universe—both the observable universe and beyond. While the local geometry does not determine the global geometry completely, it does limit the possibilities, particularly a geometry of a constant curvature. The universe is often taken to be a geodesic manifold, free of topological defects; relaxing either of these complicates the analysis considerably. A global geometry is a local geometry plus a topology. It follows that a topology alone does not give a global geometry: for instance, Euclidean 3-space and hyperbolic 3-space have the same topology but different global geometries.

As stated in the introduction, investigations within the study of the global structure of the universe include:
* whether the universe is infinite or finite in extent,
* whether the geometry of the global universe is flat, positively curved, or negatively curved, and,
* whether the topology is simply connected (for example, like a sphere) or else multiply connected (for example, like a torus).

=== Infinite or finite ===
One of the unanswered questions about the universe is whether it is infinite or finite in extent. For intuition, it can be understood that a finite universe has a finite volume that, for example, could be in theory filled with a finite amount of material, while an infinite universe is unbounded and no numerical volume could possibly fill it. Mathematically, the question of whether the universe is infinite or finite is referred to as boundedness. An infinite universe (unbounded metric space) means that there are points arbitrarily far apart: for any distance , there are points that are of a distance at least apart. A finite universe is a bounded metric space, where there is some distance such that all points are within distance of each other. The smallest such is called the diameter of the universe, in which case the universe has a well-defined &quot;volume&quot; or &quot;scale&quot;.

==== With or without boundary ====
Assuming a finite universe, the universe can either have an edge or no edge. Many finite mathematical spaces, e.g., a disc, have an edge or boundary. Spaces that have an edge are difficult to treat, both conceptually and mathematically. Namely, it is difficult to state what would happen at the edge of such a universe. For this reason, spaces that have an edge are typically excluded from consideration.

However, there exist many finite spaces, such as the 3-sphere and 3-torus, that have no edges. Mathematically, these spaces are referred to as being compact without boundary. The term compact means that it is finite in extent (&quot;bounded&quot;) and complete. The term &quot;without boundary&quot; means that the space has no edges. Moreover, so that calculus can be applied, the universe is typically assumed to be a differentiable manifold. A mathematical object that possesses all these properties, compact without boundary and differentiable, is termed a closed manifold. The 3-sphere and 3-torus are both closed manifolds.

==== Observational methods ====
In the 1990s and early 2000s, empirical methods for determining the global topology using measurements on scales that would show multiple imaging were proposed and applied to cosmological observations.

In the 2000s and 2010s, it was shown that, since the universe is inhomogeneous as shown in the cosmic web of large-scale structure, acceleration effects measured on local scales in the patterns of the movements of galaxies should, in principle, reveal the global topology of the universe.

=== Curvature ===
The curvature of the universe places constraints on the topology. If the spatial geometry is spherical, i.e., possess positive curvature, the topology is compact. For a flat (zero curvature) or a hyperbolic (negative curvature) spatial geometry, the topology can be either compact or infinite. Many textbooks erroneously state that a flat or hyperbolic universe implies an infinite universe; however, the correct statement is that a flat universe that is also simply connected implies an infinite universe. For example, Euclidean space is flat, simply connected, and infinite, but there are tori that are flat, multiply connected, finite, and compact (see flat torus).

In general, local to global theorems in Riemannian geometry relate the local geometry to the global geometry. If the local geometry has constant curvature, the global geometry is very constrained, as described in Thurston geometries.

The latest research shows that even the most powerful future experiments (like the SKA) will not be able to distinguish between a flat, open and closed universe if the true value of cosmological curvature parameter is smaller than 10−4. If the true value of the cosmological curvature parameter is larger than 10−3 we will be able to distinguish between these three models even now.

Final results of the &quot;Planck&quot; mission, released in 2018, show the cosmological curvature parameter, , to be , consistent with a flat universe. (i.e. positive curvature: , , , negative curvature: , , , zero curvature: , , ).

==== Universe with zero curvature ====
In a universe with zero curvature, the local geometry is flat. The most familiar such global structure is that of Euclidean space, which is infinite in extent. Flat universes that are finite in extent include the torus and Klein bottle. Moreover, in three dimensions, there are 10 finite closed flat 3-manifolds, of which 6 are orientable and 4 are non-orientable. These are the Bieberbach manifolds. The most familiar is the aforementioned 3-torus universe.

In the absence of dark energy, a flat universe expands forever but at a continually decelerating rate, with expansion asymptotically approaching zero. With dark energy, the expansion rate of the universe initially slows down, due to the effect of gravity, but eventually increases. The ultimate fate of the universe is the same as that of an open universe in the sense that space will continue expanding forever.

A flat universe can have zero total energy.

==== Universe with positive curvature ====
A positively curved universe is described by elliptic geometry, and can be thought of as a three-dimensional hypersphere, or some other spherical 3-manifold (such as the Poincaré dodecahedral space), all of which are quotients of the 3-sphere.

Poincaré dodecahedral space is a positively curved space, colloquially described as &quot;soccerball-shaped&quot;, as it is the quotient of the 3-sphere by the binary icosahedral group, which is very close to icosahedral symmetry, the symmetry of a soccer ball. This was proposed by Jean-Pierre Luminet and colleagues in 2003 and an optimal orientation on the sky for the model was estimated in 2008.

==== Universe with negative curvature ====
A hyperbolic universe, one of a negative spatial curvature, is described by hyperbolic geometry, and can be thought of locally as a three-dimensional analog of an infinitely extended saddle shape. There are a great variety of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and their classification is not completely understood. Those of finite volume can be understood via the Mostow rigidity theorem. For hyperbolic local geometry, many of the possible three-dimensional spaces are informally called &quot;horn topologies&quot;, so called because of the shape of the pseudosphere, a canonical model of hyperbolic geometry. An example is the Picard horn, a negatively curved space, colloquially described as &quot;funnel-shaped&quot;.

==== Curvature: open or closed ====
When cosmologists speak of the universe as being &quot;open&quot; or &quot;closed&quot;, they most commonly are referring to whether the curvature is negative or positive, respectively. These meanings of open and closed are different from the mathematical meaning of open and closed used for sets in topological spaces and for the mathematical meaning of open and closed manifolds, which gives rise to ambiguity and confusion. In mathematics, there are definitions for a closed manifold (i.e., compact without boundary) and open manifold (i.e., one that is not compact and without boundary). A &quot;closed universe&quot; is necessarily a closed manifold. An &quot;open universe&quot; can be either a closed or open manifold. For example, in the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) model, the universe is considered to be without boundaries, in which case &quot;compact universe&quot; could describe a universe that is a closed manifold.

<doc id="99302" wikidata="Q49240" url="?curid=99302" title="Stockton, California">
<text>Stockton is a city in and the county seat of San Joaquin County in the Central Valley of the U.S. state of California. It is the most populous city in the county, the 11th-most populous city in California and the 60th-most populous city in the United States. Stockton&#x27;s population in 2020 was 320,804. It was named an All-America City in 1999, 2004, 2015, and again in 2017 and 2018. The city is located on the San Joaquin River in the northern San Joaquin Valley. It lies at the southeastern corner of a large inland river delta that isolates it from other nearby cities such as Sacramento and those of the San Francisco Bay Area.

Stockton was founded by Charles Maria Weber in 1849 after he acquired Rancho Campo de los Franceses. The city is named after Robert F. Stockton, and it was the first community in California to have a name not of Spanish or Native American origin.

Built during the California Gold Rush, Stockton&#x27;s seaport serves as a gateway to the Central Valley and beyond. It provided easy access for trade and transportation to the southern gold mines. The University of the Pacific (UOP), chartered in 1851, is the oldest university in California, and has been located in Stockton since 1923. In 2012, Stockton filed for what was then the largest municipal bankruptcy in US historywhich had multiple causes, including financial mismanagement in the 1990s, generous fringe benefits to unionized city employees, and the 2008 financial crisis. Stockton successfully exited bankruptcy in February 2015.

==History==

When Europeans first arrived in the Stockton area, it was occupied by the Yatchicumne, a branch of the Northern Valley Yokuts Indians. They built their villages on low mounds to keep their homes above regular floods. A Yokuts village named Pasasimas was located on a mound between Edison and Harrison Streets on what is now the Stockton Channel in downtown Stockton.

The Siskiyou Trail began in the northern San Joaquin Valley. It was a centuries-old Native American footpath that led through the Sacramento Valley over the Cascades and into present-day Oregon.

The extensive network of waterways in and around Stockton was fished and navigated by Miwok Indians for centuries. During the California Gold Rush, the San Joaquin River was navigable by ocean-going vessels, making Stockton a natural inland seaport and point of supply and departure for prospective gold-miners. From the mid-19th century onward, Stockton became the region&#x27;s transportation hub, dealing mainly with agricultural products.

===19th century===


====Mexican era====

Carlos Maria Weber was a German émigré in the United States in 1836. He was born as Carl David Weber (February 18, 1814, in Steinwenden – May 4, 1881, in Stockton) and then went by Charles in 1836 in the United States, first spending time in New Orleans and then in Texas. He then came overland from Missouri to California with the Bartleson-Bidwell Party in 1841 and began to go by Carlos, when he began working for John Sutter. In 1842 Weber settled in the Pueblo of San José.

As an alien, Weber could not secure a land grant directly, so he formed a partnership with Guillermo (William) Gulnac. Born in New York, Gulnac had married a Mexican woman and sworn allegiance to Mexico, which then ruled California. He applied in Weber&#x27;s place for Rancho Campo de los Franceses, a land grant of 11 square leagues on the east side of the San Joaquin River.

Gulnac and Weber dissolved their partnership in 1843. Gulnac&#x27;s attempts to settle the Rancho Campo de los Franceses failed, and Weber acquired it in 1845. In 1846 Weber had induced a number of settlers to locate on the rancho when the Mexican–American War broke out. Considered a Californio, Weber was offered the position of captain by Mexican general José Castro, which he declined; he later, however, accepted the position of captain in the Cavalry of the United States. Captain Weber&#x27;s decision to change sides lost him a great deal of the trust he had built up among his Mexican business partners. As a result, he moved to the grant in 1847 and sold his business in San Jose in 1849.

====Gold Rush era====

At the start of the California Gold Rush in 1848, Europeans and Americans started to arrive in the area of Weber&#x27;s rancho on their way to the goldfields. When Weber decided to try his hand at gold mining in late 1848, he soon found selling supplies to gold-seekers was more profitable.

As the head of navigation on the San Joaquin River, the city grew rapidly as a miners&#x27; supply point during the Gold Rush. Weber built the first permanent residence in the San Joaquin Valley on a piece of land now known as Weber Point. During the Gold Rush, the location of what is now Stockton developed as a river port, the hub of roads to the gold settlements in the San Joaquin Valley and northern terminus of the Stockton - Los Angeles Road. During its early years, Stockton was known by several names, including &quot;Weberville,&quot; &quot;Fat City,&quot; &quot;Mudville&quot; and &quot;California&#x27;s Sunrise Seaport.&quot; In 1849 Weber laid out a town, which he named &quot;Tuleburg,&quot; but he soon decided on &quot;Stockton&quot; in honor of Commodore Robert F. Stockton. Stockton was the first community in California to have a name that was neither Spanish nor Native American in origin.

====Chinese immigration====

Thousands of Chinese came to Stockton from the Guangdong province of China during the 1850s due to a combination of political and economic unrest in China and the discovery of gold in California. After the gold rush, many worked for the railroads and land reclamation projects in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta and remained in Stockton. By 1880 Stockton was home to the third-largest Chinese community in California. Discriminatory laws, in particular the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, restricted immigration and prevented the Chinese from buying property. The Lincoln Hotel, built in 1920 by the Wong brothers on South El Dorado Street, was considered one of Stockton&#x27;s finest hotels of the time. Only after the Magnuson Act was repealed in 1962 were American-born Chinese allowed to buy property and own buildings.

====Incorporation====

The city was officially incorporated on July 23, 1850, by the county court, and the first city election was held on July 31, 1850. In 1851 the City of Stockton received its charter from the State of California. Early settlers included gold seekers from Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe, the Pacific Islands, Mexico and Canada. The historical population diversity is reflected in Stockton street names, architecture, numerous ethnic festivals and the faces and heritage of a majority of its citizens. In 1870 the Census Bureau reported Stockton&#x27;s population as 87.6% white and 10.7% Asian. Many Chinese were immigrating to California as workers in these years, especially for the Transcontinental Railroad.

Benjamin Holt settled in Stockton in 1883 and with his three brothers founded the Stockton Wheel Co., and later the Holt Manufacturing Company.

===20th century===

On Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 1904, Holt successfully tested the first workable continuous track tread machine, plowing soggy San Joaquin Valley Delta farmland. Company photographer Charles Clements was reported to have observed that the tractor crawled like a caterpillar, and Holt seized on the metaphor. &quot;Caterpillar it is. That&#x27;s the name for it.&quot;

On April 22, 1918, British Army Col. Ernest Dunlop Swinton visited Stockton while on a tour of the United States. The British and French armies were using many hundreds of Holt tractors to haul heavy guns and supplies during World War I, and Swinton publicly thanked Holt and his workforce for their contribution to the war effort. During 1914 and 1915, Swinton had advocated basing some sort of armored fighting vehicle on Holt&#x27;s caterpillar tractors, but without success (although Britain did develop tanks, they came from a separate source and were not directly derived from Holt machines). After the appearance of tanks on the battlefield, Holt built a prototype, the gas–electric tank, but it did not enter production.

On January 10, 1920, a major fire on Main Street threatened an entire city block. At about 2 a.m., a blaze was discovered in the basement of the Yost-Dohrmann store, which was gutted, and adjacent businesses were damaged by flames and water. Damage was estimated at $150,000.

By 1931, the Stockton Electric Railroad Co. operated 40 streetcars over of track.

Stockton is the site of the first Sikh temple in the United States; Gurdwara Sahib Stockton opened on October 24, 1912. It was founded by Baba Jawala Singh and Baba Wasakha Singh, successful Punjabi immigrants who farmed and owned on the Holt River.

In 1933, the port was modernized, and the Stockton Deepwater Channel, which improved water passage to San Francisco Bay, was deepened and completed. This created commercial opportunities that fueled the city&#x27;s growth. Ruff and Ready Island Naval Supply Depot was established, placing Stockton in a strategic position during the Cold War. During the Great Depression the town&#x27;s canning industry became the battleground of a labor dispute resulting in the Spinach Riot of 1937.
During World War II, the Stockton Assembly Center was built on the San Joaquin County Fairgrounds, a few blocks from what was then the city center. One of 15 temporary detention sites run by the Wartime Civilian Control Administration, the center held some 4,200 Japanese-Americans removed from their West Coast homes under Executive Order 9066, while they waited for transfer to more permanent and isolated camps in the interior of the country. The center opened on May 10, 1942, and operated until October 17, when the majority of its population was sent to Rohwer, Arkansas. The former incarceration site was named a California Historical Landmark in 1980, and in 1984 a marker was erected at the entrance to the fairgrounds.

In 1979, the development of a residential area in Stockton at a burial ground of the tribe unearthed two hundred Miwok remains. In an attempt to prevent the further desecration of the burial grounds, a descendant of the people initiated a legal case which became &quot;Wana the Bear v. Community Construction&quot; (1982). The decision ultimately sided with the development company, which was heavily criticized by Native Americans as a display of ethnocentrism.

In September 1996, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission announced the final closure of Stockton&#x27;s Naval Reserve Center on Rough and Ready Island. Formerly known as Ruff and Ready Island Naval Supply Depot, the island&#x27;s facilities had served as a major communications outpost for submarine activities in the Pacific during the Cold War. The site is slowly being redeveloped as commercial property.

==Geography==

Stockton is situated amidst the farmland of California&#x27;s San Joaquin Valley, a subregion of the Central Valley. In and around Stockton are thousands of miles of waterways that make up the California Delta.

Interstate 5 and State Route 99, inland California&#x27;s major north–south highways, pass through the city. State Route 4 and the dredged San Joaquin River connect the city with the San Francisco Bay Area to its west, creating the Stockton Deepwater Shipping Channel. Stockton and Sacramento are California&#x27;s only inland sea ports.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city occupies a total area of , of which is land and , comprising 4.76%, is water.

==Economy==

Historically an agricultural community, Stockton&#x27;s economy has since diversified into other industries, which include telecommunications and manufacturing.

Stockton&#x27;s central location, relative to San Francisco and Sacramento, its proximity to the state and interstate freeway system, and its comparatively inexpensive land costs have prompted several companies to base their regional operations in the city.

===Shopping===
The city of Stockton has one shopping mall, the Weberstown Mall. The city previously housed the Sherwood Mall, adjacent to Weberstown, but in 2022, it was converted into a shopping center now named Sherwood Place. It has the only Dillard&#x27;s in the Northern California region at the Weberstown Mall, as well as one of the three Sears stores still operating in the Northern California region.

===Construction and public spending===
Beginning in the late 1990s, Stockton had commenced some revitalization projects.

===Real estate bubble===
The Stockton real estate market was disproportionately affected by the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis, and the city led the United States in foreclosures for that year, with one of every 30 homes posted for foreclosure. From September 2006 to September 2007, the value of a median-priced house in Stockton declined by 44%.

Stockton&#x27;s Weston Ranch neighborhood, a subdivision of modest tract homes built in the mid-1990s, had the worst foreclosure rate in the area according to ACORN, a now-defunct national advocacy group for low and moderate-income families. Stockton found itself squarely at the center of the 2000s&#x27; speculative housing bubble. Real estate in Stockton more than tripled in value between 1998 and 2005, but when the bubble burst in 2007, the ensuing financial crisis made Stockton one of the hardest-hit cities in United States.

Stockton housing prices fell 39% in the 2008 fiscal year, and the city had the country&#x27;s highest foreclosure rate (9.5%) as well. Stockton also had an unemployment rate of 13.3% in 2008, one of the highest in the United States. Stockton was rated by &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2009 as America&#x27;s fifth most dangerous city because of its crime rate. In 2010, mainly due to the aforementioned factors, &quot;Forbes&quot; named it one of the three worst places to live in the United States.

===City bankruptcy===
Following the 2008 financial crisis, in June 2012 Stockton became the largest city in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy protection. It was surpassed by Detroit in July 2013. The city approved a plan to exit bankruptcy in October 2013, and voters approved a sales tax on November 5, 2013, to help fund the exit.

The collapse in real estate valuations had a negative effect on the city&#x27;s revenue base. On June 28, 2012, Stockton filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy. On April 1, 2013, the United States Bankruptcy Court Eastern District of California ruled that Stockton was eligible for bankruptcy protection.

The Stockton bankruptcy case lasted longer than two years and received nationwide attention. On October 4, 2013, Stockton City Council approved a bankruptcy exit plan by a 6–0 vote to be filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of California, Sacramento. Voters approved a -cent sales tax on November 5, 2013, to help fund the bankruptcy exit.

On October 30, 2014, a federal bankruptcy judge approved the city&#x27;s bankruptcy recovery plan, thus allowing the city to continue with the planned pension payments to retired workers. The city exited from Chapter 9 bankruptcy on February 25, 2015.

===Experiment in Guaranteed Basic Income===
As part of a privately funded experiment in Universal Basic Income in 2019, the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (S.E.E.D.) conducted a pilot project that gave a $500 stipend to 125 randomly selected residents for an 24-month period with “no strings attached.&quot; It was made possible by the Economic Security Project, an advocacy group chaired by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, which provided the first $1 million for the program, and a dozen other Silicon Valley organizations and private donors who funded the rest of its $3 million budget. The positive benefits of the program during the first year were described in an interim report published in March 2021.

==Climate==

Stockton&#x27;s climate lies right on the boundary of, and fluctuates between, hot-summer Mediterranean (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) and cool semi-arid (&quot;BSk&quot;). Stockton is characterized by very hot, arid summer and cool, wet winter. In an average year, nearly 95% of the of precipitation falls from October through April. Located in the Central Valley, the temperature range is much greater than in the nearby Bay Area. The degree of diurnal temperature variation is roughly twice as high in the summer as in the winter. Tule fog blankets the area during some winter days. Stockton lies in the fertile heart of the California Mediterranean climate prairie delta, about equidistant from the Pacific Ocean and the Sierra Nevada. The intermediate climate between the coast and the Central Valley gives a similar climate to that of Badajoz, Spain.
At the airport, the highest recorded temperature was on July 23, 2006, and September 6, 2022, and the lowest was on January 11, 1949. There are an average of 88 afternoons annually with high temperatures of or higher, and 19 afternoons of or above; 19 mornings see low temperatures at or below freezing. The wettest &quot;rain year&quot; was from July 1982 to June 1983 with and the driest from July 1975 to June 1976 with . Note that regional difference of precipitation has been recorded in Stockton. The more northern part of Stockton receives more precipitation than southern Stockton.

The most rainfall in one month was in February 1998 and the most rainfall in 24 hours was on January 21, 1967. There are an average of 56.5 days with measurable precipitation. Only light amounts of snow have been recorded, and the only instance of measurable snowfall occurred on February 5, 1976, with measured.

A 2018 federal study predicts that flooding of the San Joaquin River could possibly cause much of Stockton to become submerged beneath 10–12 feet of water, causing a humanitarian disaster as costly and deadly as Hurricane Katrina if the levees are not upgraded.

===Police department===
; Cleveland Elementary School shooting

On January 17, 1989, the Stockton Police Department received a threat against Cleveland Elementary School from an unknown person. Later that day, Patrick Purdy, who was later found to be mentally ill, opened fire on the school&#x27;s playground with a semi-automatic rifle, killing five children, all Cambodian or Vietnamese refugees, and wounding 29 others, and a teacher, before taking his own life. The Cleveland Elementary School shooting received national news coverage and is sometimes referred to as the Cleveland School massacre.

; Budget crisis

The city cut its police force by more than 20% during the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, but voters approved a sales tax on November 5, 2013, that provided funds to hire an additional 120 police officers.

; Bank robbery

On July 16, 2014, officers responded to an armed bank robbery, which resulted in the four perpetrators taking three hostages and leading them on an hour-long high-speed pursuit. Over the course of the car chase, one suspect fired over 100 rounds from an AK-47s at police, disabling 14 police vehicles, including the department&#x27;s own Lenco BearCat armored personnel carrier. More than 30 officers shot over 600 rounds into the getaway vehicle. Two perpetrators were killed, two hostages were injured, one hostage was killed by police ammunition, and numerous vehicles and other property were damaged or destroyed by the nearly 1,000 rounds of ammunition fired by the robbers and police. The department faced criticism with its handling of the incident in the aftermath.

; Crime
In 2012, the City of Stockton was the 10th most dangerous city in America, reporting 1,417 violent crimes per 100,000 persons, well above the national average, and 22 murders per 100,000 (above the average of 4.7). In 2013, violent crime lessened to 1,230.3 crimes per 100,000 population, making it 19th on the list of the most dangerous cities. Stockton has experienced a high rate of violent crime, reaching a record high of 71 homicides in 2012 before dropping to 32 for all of 2013.

Stockton Police Chief Eric Jones credited 2013&#x27;s drop in the murder rate to Operation Ceasefire, a gun violence intervention strategy pioneered in Boston and implemented in Stockton in 2012, combined with a federal gun and narcotics operation.

=== Fire department ===

The Stockton Fire Department was first rated as a Class 1 fire department by the Insurance Services Office in 1971. In 2005, all 13 of the city&#x27;s stations met the National Fire Protection Association standard of a 5-minute response time. In 2009, it had 13 fire stations and over 275 career personnel. Due in part to staffing levels that placed five staff on ladder companies and four staff on engines, it was one of only 57 departments among 44,000 to receive the Class 1 rating in 2010.

The department maintained this rating until 2011, when during the city&#x27;s Chapter 9 bankruptcy proceedings and following a Civil Grand Jury investigation, the city reduced staffing levels from 220 full-time staff to 177, and the 2011 budget from $59 million to $40 million. The department was cut by 30%. The bankruptcy was due in part to a 1996 decision made by the city to provide firefighters with free health care after retirement, which they later expanded to all city employees. The benefit gradually grew into a $417 million liability.

, the department consists of 12 firehouses that house 12 Engine Companies and three Truck Companies. In 2015 the Fire Department responded to over 40,000 emergency calls for service, including more than 300 working structure fires. The department is one of the busiest in the United States. The Stockton Fire Department is assisted on medical emergency calls by American Medical Response.

Stockton is also connected to the rest of the nation through a network of railways. Stockton has two passenger rail stations. Robert J. Cabral Station, which provides service to Sacramento on Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;San Joaquins&quot; route, and also serves as the northern terminus of the Altamont Corridor Express commuter rail service to San Jose. San Joaquin Street station provides service to Oakland via the &quot;San Joaquins&quot; route.

Union Pacific and BNSF Railway, the two largest railroad networks in North America both service Stockton and its port via connections with the Stockton Terminal and Eastern Railroad and Central California Traction Company, who provide local and interconnecting services between the various rail lines. The Stockton Diamond was the busiest interchange point in the state by 2020; a grade separation project to elevate the Union Pacific over the BNSF line is planned to be completed by 2026.

===Air===
Stockton is served by Stockton Metropolitan Airport, located on county land just south of city limits. The airport has been designated a Foreign Trade Zone and is mainly used by manufacturing and agricultural companies for shipping purposes. Since airline deregulation, passenger service has come and gone several times. Domestic service resumed on June 16, 2006, with service to Las Vegas by Allegiant Air. The days of service and number of flights were expanded a few months later due to demand. Air service to Phoenix began in September 2007.

On July 1, 2010, Allegiant Air implemented non-stop service to and from Long Beach. In 2006 Aeromexico had plans to provide flights to and from Guadalajara, Mexico, but the airport&#x27;s plan to build a customs station at the airport was initially rejected by the customs service. However, the possibility of building this station is currently a continuing matter of negotiation between the airport and the customs service, and Aeromexico has indicated a continuing interest in eventually providing service. Ground transportation is available from Hertz, Enterprise, Yellow Cab and Aurora Limousine.

<text>The Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith (DDF) is a department of the Roman Curia in charge of the religious discipline of the Catholic Church. The Dicastery is the oldest among the departments of the Roman Curia. Its seat is the Palace of the Holy Office in Rome, just outside Vatican City. It was founded to defend the Catholic Church from heresy and is the body responsible for promulgating and defending Catholic doctrine.

This institution was founded by Pope Paul III on 21 July 1542, as the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition. It was then renamed in 1908 as the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office. In 1965, it became the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF; ). Since 2022, it is named Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith. It is still informally known as the Holy Office () in many Catholic countries. The sole objective of the dicastery is to &quot;spread sound Catholic doctrine and defend those points of Christian tradition which seem in danger because of new and unacceptable doctrines.&quot;

The congregation employs an advisory board including cardinals, bishops, priests, lay theologians, and canon lawyers. On 1 July 2023, Pope Francis named Argentine archbishop Víctor Manuel Fernández as prefect, who took possession of the office in mid-September.

==History==
On 21 July 1542, Pope Paul III proclaimed the Apostolic Constitution &quot;Licet ab initio&quot;, establishing the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition, staffed by cardinals and other officials whose task it was &quot;to maintain and defend the integrity of the faith and to examine and proscribe errors and false doctrines.&quot; It served as the final court of appeal in trials of heresy and served as an important part of the Counter-Reformation.

This body was renamed the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office in 1908 by Pope Pius X. In many Catholic countries, the body is often informally called the Holy Office (e.g., and ).

The congregation&#x27;s name was changed to Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (SCDF) on 7 December 1965, at the end of the Second Vatican Council. Soon after the 1983 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot; came into effect, the adjective &quot;sacred&quot; was dropped from the names of all Curial Congregations, and so it became the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. In 2022, the name was changed to &quot;Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith&quot;.

On September 23, 2024, Pope Francis appointed 28 Italian new consultors of the dicastery.

===Timeline===
==Role==
According to the 1988 Apostolic Constitution on the Roman Curia, &quot;Pastor bonus&quot;, article 48, promulgated by John Paul II: &quot;The proper duty of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith is to promote and safeguard the doctrine on faith and morals in the whole Catholic world; so it has competence in things that touch this matter in any way.&quot;

This includes investigations into grave delicts (i.e., acts which the Catholic Church considers as being the most serious crimes: crimes against the Eucharist and against the sanctity of the Sacrament of Penance, and crimes against the sixth Commandment (&quot;Thou shalt not commit adultery&quot;)) committed by a cleric against a person under the age of eighteen. These crimes, in &quot;Sacramentorum sanctitatis tutela&quot; a &quot;motu proprio&quot; of 2001, come under the competency of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. In effect, it is the &quot;promoter of justice&quot; that deals with, among other things, the question of priests accused of paedophilia.

Within the DDF are the International Theological Commission and the Pontifical Biblical Commission. The Prefect of the DDF is &quot;ex officio&quot; president of these commissions.

On 7 December 2021, Pope Francis promulgated a new version of the &quot;Norms on the Delicts Reserved to the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith&quot;; the original version had been first promulgated in 2001 by John Paul II and amended in 2010 by Benedict XVI. The changes of the new version concern &quot;harmonising the norms with the revised Book VI of the Code of Canon Law, which was promulgated in May 2021&quot; and adding &quot;numerous normative measures of various kinds issued in previous years, especially since 2016.&quot;

==Organization==
Until 1968, the pope held the title of prefect and appointed a cardinal to preside over the meetings, first as Secretary, then as Pro-Prefect.

Since 1968, the Cardinal head of the dicastery has borne the title of &quot;Prefect&quot; and the title of &quot;Secretary&quot; refers to the second highest-ranking officer of the Congregation. As of 2012 the Congregation had a membership of 18 cardinals and a smaller number of non-cardinal bishops, a staff of 38 (clerical and lay) and 26 consultors.

The work of the CDF is divided into two sections, the doctrinal and the disciplinary. The CDF holds biennial plenary assemblies, and issues documents on doctrinal, disciplinary, and sacramental questions that occasionally include notifications concerning writings by Catholic theologians.

The disciplinary section has responsibility for dealing with credible allegations against clergy. Archbishop Kennedy leads a staff of 16 full-time officials.

On his appointment as prefect, Cardinal Fernández was instructed to focus on the Dicastery&#x27;s doctrinal work and leave the disciplinary section alone.

==Recent canonical judgments and publications==

The following is a non-exhaustive list of recent documents and judgments issued by the DDF. Lengthy DDF documents usually have Latin titles. A short document that briefly states objections to one or more writings by a Catholic theologian is typically called a &quot;notification&quot;.

=== 2021–present ===
* On May 18, 2024, the Dicastery Prefect Víctor Manuel Fernández published a 2024 text signed by Pope Francis which replaced the 1978 &quot;Normae Congregationis&quot; rulings.

Fernández enumerated six possible conclusions for alleged supernatural phenomena discernment.

* On 28 September 2007, Gaston Hebert, the then apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Little Rock, stated that (per the 11 July Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith) six Arkansas nuns were excommunicated for heresy (the first in the diocese&#x27;s 165-year history). They refused to recant the doctrines of the Community of the Lady of All Nations (Army of Mary). The nuns are members of the Good Shepherd Monastery of Our Lady of Charity and Refuge in Hot Springs. Sister Mary Theresa Dionne, 82, one of the six, said they will still live at the convent property, which they own.

==Leadership==
===Secretaries until 1965===

When the Supreme Sacred Congregation for the Roman and Universal Inquisition was first established in 1542, it was composed of several Cardinal Inquisitors styled as &quot;Inquisitors-General&quot;, who were formally equal to each other, even if some of them were clearly dominant (e.g. Cardinal Gian Pietro Carafa from 1542, who was elected Pope Paul IV in 1555). Until 1968 the Pope himself presided over the Congregation. However, from 1564 the daily administration of the affairs of the Congregation was entrusted to the Cardinal Secretary. This model was retained when the Inquisition was formally renamed as the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office in 1908.

Unless stated otherwise, the term of office ended with the officeholder&#x27;s death.

===Prefects since 1965===
When Pope Paul VI changed the name of the dicastery on 7 December 1965, he changed the title of the cardinal in charge of the daily administration of the Congregation from Secretary to Pro-Prefect. He continued to reserve the title of Prefect to himself until 1968 when he relinquished his role as head of the Congregation and named a &quot;Prefect&quot;.

===Secretaries since 1965===
With the December 1965 reorganization of the Holy Office as the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the head of the Congregation was no longer titled Secretary. The dicastery&#x27;s second-in-command, until then titled assessor, was then given the title of Secretary, as was already the case with the other Roman Congregations. All but the most recent have been made archbishops upon their appointment. The following have held the title of Secretary:

*Pietro Parente (7 December 1965 – 29 June 1967)
*Paul-Pierre Philippe, O.P. (29 June 1967 – 6 March 1973)
*Jean Jérôme Hamer, O.P. (14 June 1973 – 8 April 1984)
*Alberto Bovone (5 April 1984 – 13 June 1995)
*Tarcisio Bertone, S.D.B. (13 June 1995 – 10 December 2002)
*Angelo Amato, S.D.B. (19 December 2002 – 9 July 2008)
*Luis Ladaria Ferrer, S.J. (9 July 2008 – 2 July 2017)
*Giacomo Morandi (18 July 2017 – 10 January 2022)
*Archbishop John Joseph Kennedy, (Disciplinary Section) and Armando Matteo (Doctrinal Section) (23 April 2022 – present)

== Present composition ==

* Cardinal-Prefect: Víctor Manuel Fernández
* Secretary for Discipline: Archbishop John Joseph Kennedy
* Secretary for Doctrine: Armando Matteo
* Adjunct Secretary: Archbishop Joseph Augustine Di Noia, O.P. 
* Adjunct Secretary: Archbishop Charles Scicluna
* Undersecretary: Fr. Matteo Visioli
* Undersecretary: Archbishop Philippe Curbelié
* Promoter of Justice: Fr. Robert J. Geisinger S.J.
* 27 members
* 28 Consultors (religious superiors and canon lawyers)
* Staff of 33 lay theologians

<text>Pearl Harbor is a 2001 American romantic war drama film directed by Michael Bay, produced by Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer and written by Randall Wallace. Starring Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, Josh Hartnett, Cuba Gooding Jr., Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Colm Feore, and Alec Baldwin, the film features a heavily fictionalized version of the attack on Pearl Harbor, focusing on a love story set amidst the lead up to the attack, its aftermath, and the Doolittle Raid.

The film was a box office success, grossing $59 million in its opening weekend and $449.2 million worldwide, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2001. It received generally negative reviews from critics, although there was praise for the visual effects, action sequences, Bay&#x27;s direction and music score. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning in the category of Best Sound Editing. It was also nominated for six Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture.

==Plot==

In 1923, in Tennessee, two best friends, Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker, play together in the back of an old biplane, pretending to be fighting airmen.

In 1941, as World War II raging, Danny and Rafe are both first lieutenants under the command of Major Jimmy Doolittle. Doolittle informs Rafe that he has been accepted into the Eagle Squadron (an RAF outfit for American pilots during the Battle of Britain). A nurse named Evelyn Johnson passes Rafe&#x27;s medical exam despite his dyslexia, and the two strike up a relationship. Four weeks later, Rafe and Evelyn, now deeply in love, enjoy an evening of dancing at a nightclub and later a jaunt in the New York harbor in a borrowed police boat. Rafe shocks Evelyn by saying that he has joined the Eagle Squadron and is leaving the next day. During a mission to intercept a Luftwaffe bombing raid, Rafe is shot down over the English Channel and is presumed killed in action. Danny and Evelyn mourn Rafe&#x27;s death together, which spurs a romance between the two.

Meanwhile, Japan prepares to attack the US Pacific Fleet, deciding the best way to do so would be a decisive strike on the Pearl Harbor naval base.

On the night of December 6, Evelyn is shocked to discover Rafe standing outside her door, having survived his downing and the ensuing months trapped in Nazi-occupied France. Rafe, in turn, discovers Danny&#x27;s romance with Evelyn and leaves for the Hula bar, where he is welcomed back by his overjoyed fellow pilots. Danny finds a drunken Rafe in the bar with the intention of reconciling, but the two get into a fight. They drive away, avoiding being put in the brig when the military police arrive at the bar. The two fall asleep in Danny&#x27;s car.

Next morning, on December 7, the Imperial Japanese Navy begins its attack on Pearl Harbor. The US Pacific Fleet is severely damaged in the surprise attack, and most of the defending airfields are obliterated before they are able to launch fighters to defend the harbor. Rafe and Danny take off in P-40 fighter planes, and they shoot down several of the attacking planes. They later assist in the rescue of the crew of the capsized , but are too late to save the crew of the obliterated .

The next day, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt delivers his Day of Infamy Speech to the nation and requests that the US Congress declare a state of war with the Empire of Japan. The survivors attend a memorial service to honor the numerous dead. Danny and Rafe are both assigned to travel stateside under Doolittle, though they are not told why. Before they leave, Evelyn reveals to Rafe that she is pregnant with Danny&#x27;s child. Evelyn reassures Rafe she loved him in the past and will love him her whole life, but says she is ready to give Danny her &quot;whole heart&quot; and have their family together.

Danny and Rafe are both promoted to captain and awarded the Silver Star for their actions at Pearl Harbor, and Doolittle asks them to volunteer for a secret mission. During the next three months, Rafe, Danny and other pilots train for ultra-short takeoffs with specially modified B-25 Mitchell bombers. In April, the raiders are sent toward Japan on board . Their mission is to bomb Tokyo, after which they will land in China. The mission is successful, but Rafe&#x27;s and Danny&#x27;s planes run out of fuel and crash in Japanese-occupied territory in China. A gunfight ensues between the raiders and Japanese ground troops, and Danny is mortally wounded shielding Rafe before the group are rescued by Chinese soldiers. Desperately trying to will Danny back to life, Rafe tearfully reveals to Danny, &quot;you&#x27;re going to be a father.&quot; With his last breath, Danny replies, &quot;No, you are.&quot;

After the war, Rafe and Evelyn, now married, visit Danny&#x27;s grave with Evelyn&#x27;s son, named Danny after his biological father. Rafe then asks his stepson if he would like to go flying, and they fly off into the sunset in the old biplane that Rafe&#x27;s father once owned.

==Production==
The proposed budget of $208 million that Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer wanted was an area of contention with Walt Disney Studios executives, since a great deal of the budget was to be expended on production aspects. The budget was eventually reduced to $140 million. Even at the reduced budget, Disney managed to get many of the crew and others to defer some of their pay until the film grossed in the region of $140 million. This included the director of photography, the editor, production designer and lighting director and their departments deferring around $5 to $10 million as well as Panavision, Technicolor and Industrial Light &amp; Magic also agreeing to deferrals. Bay also deferred his salary but he and Bruckheimer were the only ones to receive profit participation.

Also controversial was the effort to change the film&#x27;s rating from R to PG-13. Bay initially wanted to graphically portray the horrors of war and was not interested in primarily marketing the final product to a teen and young adult audience. However, even though he wanted to make an R-rated movie, Bay admitted that the problem was that young children would not be able to see it, and he felt that they should. As such, when he was ordered by Disney to make a PG-13 film, he didn&#x27;t argue. As a compromise, he was allowed to release an R-rated Director&#x27;s Cut on DVD later on in 2002. Budget fights continued throughout the planning of the film, with Bay &quot;walking&quot; on several occasions. Dick Cook, chairman of Disney at the time, said &quot;I think &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; was one of the most difficult shoots of modern history.&quot;

In order to recreate the atmosphere of pre-war Pearl Harbor, the producers staged the film in Hawaii and used current naval facilities. Many active duty military members stationed in Hawaii and members of the local population served as extras during the filming. The set at Rosarito Beach in the Mexican state of Baja California was used for scale model work as required. Formerly the set of &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), Rosarito was the ideal location to recreate the death throes of the battleships in the Pearl Harbor attack. A large-scale model of the bow section of mounted on the world&#x27;s largest gimbal produced an authentic rolling and submerging of the doomed battleship. Production Engineer Nigel Phelps stated that the sequence of the ship rolling out of the water and slapping down would involve one of the &quot;biggest set elements&quot; to be staged. Matched with computer generated imagery, the action had to reflect precision and accuracy throughout. Production was due to commence April 8, 2000 for 85 days.

Michael Fassbender read for the part of Rafe, Fassbender said that Disney sent him a &quot;really nice note&quot; telling him that he didn&#x27;t get the part. Charlize Theron turned down a role in the film so that she could star in &quot;Sweet November&quot;.

The vessel most seen in the movie was USS &quot;Lexington&quot;, representing both USS &quot;Hornet&quot; and a Japanese carrier. All aircraft take-offs during the movie were filmed on board the &quot;Lexington&quot;, a museum ship in Corpus Christi, Texas. The aircraft on display were removed for filming and were replaced with film aircraft as well as World War II anti-aircraft turrets. Other ships used in filler scenes included , and during filming for the carrier sequences. Filming was also done on board the museum battleship located near Houston, Texas. The Naval Historical Center of the United States army was involved in the production of the film, the Center suggested changing the depiction of Doolittle who they considered to be written as &quot;a boorish, oafish guy&quot;, this recommendation was accepted.

==Release==

===Marketing===
The teaser trailer premiered in June 2000 in front of &quot;The Patriot&quot;″s theatrical screenings. Disney premiered the film at Pearl Harbor itself, aboard the active nuclear aircraft carrier , which made a six-day trip from San Diego to serve as &quot;the world&#x27;s largest and most expensive outdoor theater&quot;. More than 2,000 people attended the premiere on the &quot;Stennis&quot;, which had special grandstand seating and one of the world&#x27;s largest movie screens assembled on the flight deck. The guests included various Hawaii political leaders, most of the lead actors from the film, and over 500 news media from around the world that Disney flew in to cover the event. The party was estimated to have cost Disney $5 million.

===Box office===
During its opening weekend, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; generated a total of $59 million, then made $75.1 million during its first four days. At the time, it achieved the second-highest Memorial Day weekend gross, behind &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;. The film also had the fourth-highest opening weekend, after the latter film, &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. For 15 years, it would have the highest opening weekend for a Ben Affleck film until 2016 when &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; surpassed it. When the film was released, it topped the box office, knocking out &quot;Shrek&quot;. It earned $30 million during its second weekend while staying at the number one spot ahead of the latter film, &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; and &quot;The Animal&quot;. This was the most recent film to top the box office for multiple weeks until that August when &quot;American Pie 2&quot; became the next one to do so. The film would then drop into third place behind &quot;Swordfish&quot; and &quot;Shrek&quot;, making $14.9 million.

In Japan, the film opened on 424 screens and grossed $7.2 million in its opening weekend (including $1.6 million in previews), a record for Buena Vista International in Japan, and the sixth highest opening of all-time. Meanwhile, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; generated a three-day gross of $4.5 million in the United Kingdom, becoming the country&#x27;s fourth-highest June opening weekend, behind &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;The Mummy&quot;. It had a record opening in China, grossing $3.9 million in 6 days. The film also made $2.5 million in Mexico, making it the fifth-highest opening for a live-action film in the country, trailing &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Godzilla&quot;. Making $870,000, it was Argentina&#x27;s second-highest opening of 2001, after &quot;Hannibal&quot;.

&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; grossed $198,542,554 at the US and Canadian box office and $250,678,391 overseas for a worldwide total of $449,220,945, making this the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2001. It is also the third-highest-grossing romantic drama film of all time, as of January 2013, behind &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Ghost&quot;.

===Home media===
&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on December 4, 2001 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment (under the Touchstone Home Video label). Both home video versions are THX certified, featuring a historical documentary and a music video, while also having the film split into two parts. The VHS release has two separate cassettes and comes with widescreen and fullscreen versions. As for the DVD release, it includes two separate discs that feature the first and second halves of the film, along with Dolby Headphone and DTS audio tracks. In its first week, the film sold more than 7 million units and made more than $130 million in retail sales.

On July 2, 2002, Buena Vista Home Entertainment released the film on an R-rated four-disc Director&#x27;s Cut DVD, which included about a minute of additional footage. This release also features three audio commentaries. The first one has Michael Bay and Jeanine Basinger, which was recorded 250 hours after the September 11 attacks.

At the 5th Annual DVD awards, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; won the Best Audio Presentation category, tying with &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; holds an approval rating of 24% based on 194 reviews, with an average rating of 4.5/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; tries to be the &quot;Titanic&quot; of war movies, but it&#x27;s just a tedious romance filled with laughably bad dialogue. The 40-minute action sequence is spectacular though.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 44 out of 100 based on 35 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A−&quot; on scale of A to F.

&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert gave the film one and a half stars, writing: &quot;&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is a two-hour movie squeezed into three hours, about how, on Dec. 7, 1941, the Japanese staged a surprise attack on an American love triangle. Its centerpiece is 40 minutes of redundant special effects, surrounded by a love story of stunning banality. The film has been directed without grace, vision, or originality, and although you may walk out quoting lines of dialogue, it will not be because you admire them.&quot; Ebert also criticized the liberties the film took with historical facts: &quot;There is no sense of history, strategy or context; according to this movie, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor because America cut off its oil supply, and they were down to an 18-month reserve. Would going to war restore the fuel sources? Did they perhaps also have imperialist designs? Movie doesn&#x27;t say.&quot; In his later &quot;Great Movies&quot; essay on &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, Ebert likewise wrote, &quot;What you realize watching &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; is that the word &#x27;epic&#x27; refers not to the cost or the elaborate production, but to the size of the ideas and vision. Werner Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&quot; didn&#x27;t cost as much as the catering in &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, but it is an epic, and &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is not.&quot; Ed Gonzalez of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; gave the film one out of four stars and wrote, &quot;Middlingly racist, humorless, and downright inept, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is solely for fans of fireworks factories.&quot;

A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Nearly every line of the script drops from the actors&#x27; mouths with the leaden clank of exposition, timed with bad sitcom beats.&quot; Mike Clark of &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film two out of four stars and wrote, &quot;Ships, planes and water combust and collide in &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, but nothing else does in one of the wimpiest wartime romances ever filmed.&quot;

In his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Desson Howe wrote, &quot;although this Walt Disney movie is based, inspired and even partially informed by a real event referred to as Pearl Harbor, the movie is actually based on the movies &quot;Top Gun&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. Don&#x27;t get confused.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;Affleck, Hartnett and Beckinsale – a British actress without a single worthy line to wrap her credible American accent around – are attractive actors, but they can&#x27;t animate this moldy romantic triangle.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Richard Schickel criticized the love triangle: &quot;It requires a lot of patience for an audience to sit through the dithering. They&#x27;re nice kids and all that, but they don&#x27;t exactly claw madly at one another. It&#x27;s as if they know that someday they&#x27;re going to be part of &quot;the Greatest Generation&quot; and don&#x27;t want to offend Tom Brokaw. Besides, megahistory and personal history never integrate here.&quot; Robert W. Butler of &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; wrote, &quot;The dialogue is so unrelentingly banal as to make one reconsider whether James Cameron&#x27;s writing on &quot;Titanic&quot; was really all that bad.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; was more positive, giving the film a &quot;B−&quot; rating, and Owen Gleiberman praised the Pearl Harbor attack sequence: &quot;Bay&#x27;s staging is spectacular but also honorable in its scary, hurtling exactitude. ... There are startling point-of-view shots of torpedoes dropping into the water and speeding toward their targets, and though Bay visualizes it all with a minimum of graphic carnage, he invites us to register the terror of the men standing helplessly on deck, the horrifying split-second deliverance as bodies go flying and explosions reduce entire battleships to liquid walls of collapsing metal.&quot;

In his review for &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, Andrew Sarris wrote, &quot;here is the ironic twist in my acceptance of &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; – the parts I liked most are the parts before and after the digital destruction of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese carrier planes&quot; and felt that &quot;&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is not so much about World War II as it is about movies about World War II. And what&#x27;s wrong with that?&quot;

Critics in Japan received the film more positively than in most countries with one likening it to &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; set during World War II and another describing it as more realistic than &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cited Bay&#x27;s direction of &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; as one of the fifty worst decisions in film history. Andy Greene described it as a less successful attempt to replicate the success of &quot;Titanic&quot; and Bay&#x27;s previous film, &quot;Armageddon&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning in the category of Best Sound Editing. It was also nominated for six Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture. This marked the first occurrence of a Worst Picture-nominated film winning an Academy Award; it is also the only film directed by Bay to win an Academy Award.

==Historical accuracy==
Like many historical dramas, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; provoked debate about the artistic license taken by its producers and director. National Geographic Channel produced a documentary called &quot;Beyond the Movie: Pearl Harbor&quot; detailing some of the ways that &quot;the film&#x27;s final cut didn&#x27;t reflect all the attacks&#x27; facts, or represent them all accurately&quot;. The film was ranked number three on Careeraftermilitary.com&#x27;s &quot;10 Most Inaccurate Military Movies Ever Made,&quot; which also included &quot;The Patriot&quot;, &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot;, &quot;U-571&quot;, &quot;The Green Berets&quot;, &quot;Windtalkers&quot;, &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot;, &quot;Red Tails&quot;, &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; and &quot;Flyboys&quot; on its list of falsified war movie productions.

Many Pearl Harbor survivors dismissed the film as grossly inaccurate and pure Hollywood. In an interview done by Frank Wetta, producer Jerry Bruckheimer was quoted saying: &quot;We tried to be accurate, but it&#x27;s certainly not meant to be a history lesson.&quot; Historian Lawrence Suid&#x27;s review is particularly detailed as to the major factual misrepresentations of the film and the negative impact they have even on an entertainment film, as he notes that &quot;the very name of the film implies that audiences will be witnessing a historic event, accurately rendered.&quot;

The Battle of Britain had already ended in October 1940 whereas the film has it still happening in early 1941 with dogfights over the English Channel.

Critics decried the use of fictional replacements for real people, declaring that &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; was an &quot;abuse of artistic license.&quot; The roles the two male leads have in the attack sequence are analogous to the real historical deeds of United States Army Air Forces Second Lieutenants George Welch and Kenneth M. Taylor, who took to the skies in P-40 Warhawk aircraft during the Japanese attack and, together, claimed six Japanese aircraft and a few probables. Taylor called the film &quot;a piece of trash... over-sensationalized and distorted.&quot;

The scene following the attack on Pearl Harbor, where President Roosevelt demands an immediate retaliatory strike on the soil of Japan, did not happen as portrayed in the film. Admiral Chester Nimitz and General George Marshall are seen denying the possibility of an aerial attack on Japan, but in real life they actually advocated such a strike. Another inconsistency in this scene is when President Roosevelt (who was at this time in his life, stricken and confined to a wheelchair due to his disease, Guillain–Barré syndrome or Polio) is able to stand up to challenge his staff&#x27;s distrust in a strike on Japan, which never really happened.

The portrayal of the planning of the Doolittle Raid, the air raid itself, and the raid&#x27;s aftermath, is considered one of the most historically inaccurate portions of the film. In the film, Jimmy Doolittle and the rest of the Doolittle raiders had to launch from USS &quot;Hornet&quot; 624 miles off the Japanese coast and after being spotted by a few Japanese patrol boats. In actuality, the Doolittle raiders had to launch 650 miles off the Japanese coast and after being spotted by only one Japanese patrol boat. The film shows all the bombers arriving in formation over Japan, despite the real concerns over fuel when the planes have to take off prematurely. It actually took one hour to launch the 16 planes, each setting out on its own course, and at no time did the planes flew together before, during, or after the attack. In the film, the only raiders shown in the raid are depicted as dropping their bombs on Tokyo, with some of the bomb blasts obliterating entire buildings. In actuality, the Doolittle raiders did bomb Tokyo but also targeted three other industrial cities, and the damage inflicted was minimal. Prior to the raid a chalkboard containing plans for the raid does accurately reflect other destination cities, but this is mostly obscured from view and never discussed in the dialogue. The firefight with Japanese soldiers after the raiders crash-land in China is entirely fictionalized, whereas the actual smuggling of the pilots back to the United States was omitted. 

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack to &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; on Hollywood Records was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score (&quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; won). The original score was composed by Hans Zimmer. The song &quot;There You&#x27;ll Be&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.

<text>Mighty Mouse is an American animated character created by the Terrytoons studio for 20th Century Fox. He is an anthropomorphic superhero mouse, originally called Super Mouse, and made his debut in the 1942 short &quot;The Mouse of Tomorrow&quot;. The name was changed to Mighty Mouse in his eighth film, 1944&#x27;s &quot;The Wreck of the Hesperus&quot;, and the character went on to star in 80 theatrical shorts, concluding in 1961 with &quot;Cat Alarm&quot;.

In 1955, &quot;Mighty Mouse Playhouse&quot; debuted as a Saturday morning cartoon show on the CBS television network, which popularized the character far more than the original theatrical run. The show lasted until 1967. Filmation revived the character in &quot;The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse and Heckle &amp; Jeckle&quot;, which ran from 1979 to 1980, and animation director Ralph Bakshi revived the concept again in &quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot;, from 1987 to 1988.

Mighty Mouse also appeared in comic books by several publishers, including his own series, &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Mighty Mouse&quot;, which ran from 1946 to 1968.

Mighty Mouse is known for his theme song, &quot;Mighty Mouse Theme (Here I Come to Save the Day)&quot;, written by composer Marshall Barer.

==History==

===Super Mouse===
The character originated in 1942 from an idea by animator Isadore Klein at the Terrytoons studio, who suggested a parody/homage to the popular &quot;Superman&quot; character, making some sketches of a superhero fly. Paul Terry, the head of the studio, liked the idea but suggested a mouse rather than an insect.

The character was dubbed &quot;Super Mouse&quot;, and his first theatrical short, &quot;The Mouse of Tomorrow&quot;, debuted on October 16, 1942.

In his book &quot;Of Mice and Magic&quot;, critic Leonard Maltin describes the character&#x27;s origin story:

The trade journal &quot;Variety&quot; said &quot;The Mouse of Tomorrow&quot; &quot;just misses being outstanding, mainly because of faulty narration and too much kidding of Superman. Idea of super-rat conquering prowling beasts of feline world is good, but too closely follows pattern of that super hero.&quot;

Super Mouse (and his later alias, Mighty Mouse) was originally voiced by Roy Halee Sr., a tenor who often sang on radio and first started doing cartoon voices for J. R. Bray&#x27;s studio. In the operatic melodramas to follow, Halee and his quartet provided all of the vocals.

In Super Mouse&#x27;s next film, he spoofed the popular Universal Monsters films (&quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Cat&quot;, 1942). In &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; (1943), he battled bat-winged cat demons, and his origin story was changed: now he becomes Super Mouse by eating vitamins A through Z. The hero made seven films in 1942–1943 before his name was changed.

===Mighty Mouse: rename and redesign===

In 1944, Paul Terry learned that another character named &quot;Super Mouse&quot; was to be published in Standard Comics&#x27; &quot;Coo-Coo Comics&quot;, so his character&#x27;s name was changed to Mighty Mouse. The first short under the character&#x27;s new name was &quot;The Wreck of the Hesperus&quot;, released February 11, 1944, adapting the celebrated poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow with the addition of a superhero mouse. A couple months later, the studio spoofed another classic, Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;, under the title &quot;Mighty Mouse Meets Jeckyll and Hyde Cat&quot;.

By summer, Mighty Mouse&#x27;s costume got an overhaul as well. Until this point, he&#x27;d been wearing Superman&#x27;s colors—a blue costume with a red cape—but in the June 16, 1944, cartoon &quot;Eliza on the Ice&quot;, Mighty Mouse appears for the first time in a red costume, with a yellow cape. This is also the first time that the character was portrayed as living among the stars, hurtling down from the heavens to save the day.

The final design of the character debuted in the 15th cartoon, &quot;The Sultan&#x27;s Birthday&quot;, released on October 13, 1944. In this cartoon, redesigned by animator Connie Rasinski, Mighty Mouse has a fuller figure with an exaggerated upper body, and is clad in a yellow outfit, with a red cape and trunks.

Like his inspiration, Superman, Mighty Mouse&#x27;s superpowers are vast and sometimes appear limitless. His main powers include flight, super-strength and invulnerability. The early cartoons often portray him as a ruthless fighter; one of his most frequent tactics is to fly under an enemy&#x27;s chin and let loose a volley of blows, subduing the opponent through sheer physical punishment.

However, his powers can vary, depending on the demands of the story; he is sometimes knocked unconscious or rendered temporarily immobile by the villain, only to rise again by the end of the cartoon and save the day. In some films, he uses X-ray vision and psychokinesis. He was also able to turn back time in 1946&#x27;s &quot;The Johnstown Flood&quot;. Other cartoons, like 1945&#x27;s &quot;Krakatoa&quot;, show him leaving a red contrail during flight that he can manipulate like a band of solid, flexible matter. In several of the cartoons, when Mighty Mouse achieves the impossible feats, the narrator exclaims, first in a normal voice: &quot; What A Mouse!!!!!&quot;, followed by his louder triumphant voice: &quot;WHAT A MOUSE!!!!!&quot;

In a 1969 interview, Terry said that Mighty Mouse&#x27;s power had a religious aspect: &quot;When a man is sick, or down, or hurt, you say, &#x27;There&#x27;s nothing more we can do. It&#x27;s in God&#x27;s hand.&#x27; And he either survives or he doesn&#x27;t according to God&#x27;s plan. Right? So, &#x27;Man&#x27;s extremity is God&#x27;s opportunity.&#x27; So, taking that as a basis, I&#x27;d only have to get the mice in a tough spot and then say, &#x27;Isn&#x27;t there someone who can help?&#x27; &#x27;Yes, there is someone; it&#x27;s Mighty Mouse!&#x27; So, down from the heavens he&#x27;d come sailing down and lick the evil spirit, or whatever it was. And everything would be serene again.&quot; Biographer W. Gerald Harmonic notes that as of the mid 40s, Mighty Mouse would be pictured living on a star or a cloud, up in the heavens, and that he became &quot;a Christ-like figure, a savior of all &#x27;mouse-kind&#x27;.&quot;

While his typical opponents are nondescript cats, Mighty Mouse occasionally battles specific villains, though most appear in only one or two films. Several of the earliest &quot;Super Mouse&quot; films (having been made during World War II), feature the cats as thinly veiled caricatures of the Nazis, hunting down mice and marching them into concentration camp–like traps to what would otherwise be their doom. The Bat-cats, alien cats with bat wings and wheels for feet, appeared in two cartoons; in two others between 1949 and 1950 he faces a huge, dim-witted, but super-strong cat named Julius &quot;Pinhead&quot; Schlabotka (voiced by Dayton Allen) whose strength rivals Mighty Mouse&#x27;s. In rare moments, he confronts non-feline adversaries such as human villain Bad Bill Bunion and his horse, or the Automatic Mouse Trap, a brontosaur-shaped robotic monster. In &quot;The Green Line&quot; (1944), the cats and the mice live on either side of a green dividing line down the middle of their town&#x27;s main street. They agree to keep the peace as long as no one crosses it. An evil entity, a Satan cat, starts the cats and mice fighting. At the end, Mighty Mouse is cheered by mice and cats alike.

===Melodrama spoofs===
In 1945, &quot;Mighty Mouse and the Pirates&quot; was the first Mighty Mouse cartoon to feature sung dialogue, in the operetta style. &quot;Gypsy Life&quot; (1945) and &quot;The Crackpot King&quot; (1946) followed in the same style. &quot;Gypsy Life&quot; was particularly successful, earning Terry his third nomination for an Academy Award for Short Subjects (Cartoon).

There was a romantic, damsel in distress element in these cartoons—in each one, Mighty Mouse saves a dark-haired beauty from terrible trouble, and in the latter two, the camera fades out on the hero and the girl in a romantic clinch. While these were very similar to the musical melodrama spoofs that were soon to emerge, they didn&#x27;t have an overwrought narrator, or the suggestion that the cartoon is an episode of a continuing story.

In November 1947, &quot;A Fight to the Finish&quot; was the first in a series of musical melodrama spoofs, with Mighty Mouse saving damsel in distress Pearl Pureheart (sometimes &quot;Little Nell&quot;) from the villainous, mustache-twirling cat Oil Can Harry. Terrytoons revived the concept from their earlier Fanny Zilch series, a melodrama spoof that ran for seven cartoons from 1933 to 1937. Fanny was constantly tormented by a human version of Oil Can Harry, and protected by her lover, J. Leffingwell Strongheart.

&quot;A Fight to the Finish&quot; begins with a snatch of Cole Porter&#x27;s song &quot;And The Villain Still Pursued Her&quot;, which had also been used as the theme for the Fanny Zilch cartoons. The narrator opens with an urgent recap of the (nonexistent) previous episode: &quot;In our last episode, we left Mighty Mouse at the old Beaver River station. As you remember, folks, he was locked in a desperate struggle with a villain. But on with the story...&quot; Mighty Mouse is engaging in &quot;a fight to the finish&quot; with Oil Can Harry, now a villainous cat with a mustache, a top hat and a big black cloak, voiced by Tom Morrison. The blonde heroine, Pearl Pureheart, is tied up in the other room, but refuses to give up hope. Harry manages to knock out Mighty Mouse, and leaves him tied to the railroad track with a bomb on his head, and the 5:15 train due to pass by. Harry drives Pearl away to his home, where he woos her in song, to no avail. Mighty Mouse manages to blow out the fuse, stop the train and escape from his bonds, and rushes to Pearl&#x27;s rescue. At Harry&#x27;s house, they fight with fists, guns and swords, as Pearl slips out the window and onto a passing log which is floating down the river into a mill. Mighty Mouse throws Harry into the river and rushes to rescue Pearl, who&#x27;s heading for the buzzsaw. The narrator asks, &quot;Is our little heroine doomed to destruction in the sawmill? Will Mighty Mouse arrive in time? See the following episode, next week!&quot; The camera starts to iris out, but then stops, as the narrator relents, &quot;Stop! Gosh, we can&#x27;t wait until next week. Please, show us what happens, won&#x27;t you?&quot; Mighty Mouse grabs Pearl in time, and the pair have a brief romantic chorus together as the cartoon delivers a happy ending.

The melodrama spoofs continued as an occasional series over the next six years, with Oil Can Harry and Pearl Pureheart returning in thirteen more cartoons. Another memorable short was 1949&#x27;s &quot;The Perils of Pearl Pureheart&quot;, in which Oil Can Harry hypnotizes Pearl into singing &quot;Carry Me Back to Old Virginny&quot; on stage at an old saloon, where he vacuums up the tips thrown by the audience. Hypnotized for three and a half minutes of the six-minute cartoon, Pearl continues to sing as the battle between Harry and Mighty Mouse rages around her, even underwater.

To vary the formula, the melodramas started traveling to exotic locales, including Italy (&quot;Sunny Italy&quot;, 1951), Switzerland (&quot;Swiss Miss&quot;, 1951), Holland (&quot;Happy Holland&quot;, 1952) and even prehistoric times (&quot;Prehistoric Perils&quot;, 1952) and medieval times (&quot;When Mousehood Was in Flower&quot;, 1953).

The fourteen Oil Can Harry melodrama theatricals were:

* &quot;A Fight to the Finish&quot; (1947)
* &quot;Loves Labor Won&quot; (1948)
* &quot;The Mysterious Stranger&quot; (1948)
* &quot;Triple Trouble&quot; (1948)
* &quot;A Cold Romance&quot; (1949) 
* &quot;The Perils of Pearl Pureheart&quot; (1949)
* &quot;Stop, Look and Listen&quot; (1949)
* &quot;Beauty on the Beach&quot; (1950)
* &quot;Sunny Italy&quot; (1951)
* &quot;Swiss Miss&quot; (1951)
* &quot;Prehistoric Perils&quot; (1952)
* &quot;Happy Holland&quot; (1952)
* &quot;A Soapy Opera&quot; (1953)
* &quot;When Mousehood Was in Flower&quot; (1953)

===Television===
====&quot;Mighty Mouse Playhouse&quot;====

Mighty Mouse had little theatrical impact, but became Terrytoons&#x27; most popular character and a cultural icon on television. In 1955, Paul Terry sold the Terrytoons studio to CBS, which repackaged the theatrical cartoons as a popular Saturday morning show, &quot;Mighty Mouse Playhouse&quot;. The show aired from December 1955 through September 1967, using the existing film library. Only three new cartoons were produced after the sale. The final season also included a new feature, entitled &quot;The Mighty Heroes.&quot;

Tom Morrison of Terrytoons provided the speaking voice of Mighty Mouse in the show&#x27;s new framing sequences.

The show&#x27;s theme song was credited on some early records to &quot;The Terrytooners, Mitch Miller and Orchestra&quot;. However, writer Mark Evanier credits a group called The Sandpipers (not the 1960s easy listening group of the same name).

====&quot;The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse and Heckle &amp; Jeckle&quot;====

In 1979–1980, Filmation made television cartoons starring Mighty Mouse and fellow Terrytoon characters Heckle and Jeckle in a show called &quot;The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse and Heckle &amp; Jeckle&quot;. The show introduced two new characters: a vampire duck named Quacula (not to be confused with Count Duckula), and Oil Can Harry&#x27;s bumbling, large, but swift-running, henchman Swifty. The show premiered in 1979 and lasted two seasons. In the Filmation series and movie, Mighty Mouse and Oil Can Harry were performed by veteran voice artist Alan Oppenheimer, and Pearl Pureheart was voiced by Diane Pershing. Frank Welker played Heckle, Jeckle and Quacula, and Norm Prescott played Theodore H. Bear.

Each episode included two traditional &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; cartoons, as well as an episode of a Mighty Mouse science-fiction serial, &quot;The Great Space Chase&quot;. The hour was rounded out with two &quot;Heckle &amp; Jeckle&quot; cartoons and one &quot;Quacula&quot; cartoon, plus short bumpers with tips about safety and the environment. The total cartoons produced for the series were 32 &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; cartoons, 32 &quot;Heckle &amp; Jeckle&quot; cartoons, 16 episodes of &quot;The Great Space Chase&quot; and 16 &quot;Quacula&quot; cartoons.

The &quot;Space Chase&quot; episodes were edited together into a theatrical matinee movie, &quot;Mighty Mouse in the Great Space Chase&quot;, which was released on December 10, 1982.

====&quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot;====
In 1987 and 1988, animation producer Ralph Bakshi (who began his career at Terrytoons in the late 1950s and worked on the last Mighty Mouse shorts filmed by that company) created a new series of Mighty Mouse cartoons entitled &quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot; for the CBS Saturday morning children&#x27;s lineup. In this series, Mighty Mouse has a real identity, Mike Mouse (both identities voiced by Patrick Pinney), and a sidekick, Scrappy Mouse (voiced by actress Dana Hill), the little orphan. Though a children&#x27;s cartoon, its heavy satirical tone, risqué humor and adult jokes made the Bakshi Mighty Mouse series a collector&#x27;s item for collectors of older television series.

The best-remembered episode of this series featured a crossover with Mighty Mouse and another Bakshi creation, the Mighty Heroes (Strong Man, Tornado Man, Rope Man, Cuckoo Man and Diaper Man). In the 1988 episode &quot;Heroes and Zeroes&quot;, the Mighty Heroes were middle-aged men (except for Diaper Man, who was 36) and were all accountants with the firm of Man, Man, Man, Man, and Man.

====Later years====
Marvel Comics produced a 10-issue comic book series (set in the &quot;New Adventures&quot; continuity) in 1990 and 1991. Since then, little else new has been produced using the Mighty Mouse character except for a 2001 &quot;The power of cheese&quot; television commercial. That commercial shows Mighty Mouse dining calmly on cheese in a restaurant, utterly unconcerned with a scene of chaos and terror visibly unfolding in the street outside. The commercial was later removed from air following the September 11 attacks.

The character appeared in the 1999 pilot &quot;Curbside&quot;, voiced by Dee Bradley Baker.

Until 2019, the rights to Mighty Mouse were divided as a result of the 2006 corporate split of Viacom (the former owner of the Terrytoons franchise) into two separate companies. CBS Operations (a unit of the CBS Corporation) owns the ancillary rights and trademarks to the character, while Paramount Home Entertainment/CBS Home Entertainment holds home video rights. The first official release of Mighty Mouse material has been announced and what is now CBS Media Ventures has television syndication rights (the shorts are currently out of circulation). On December 4, 2019, CBS Corporation and Viacom re-merged into a single entity, ViacomCBS (now Paramount Global), officially reuniting the rights to Mighty Mouse under the same company.

In 2017, during his 75th anniversary, Mighty Mouse made his return with a 5-issue comic book series produced by Dynamite Entertainment.

===Feature film adaptation===
As early as 2004, Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies announced their intention to bring Mighty Mouse back to the motion picture screen with a CGI Mighty Mouse feature film that was tentatively scheduled to be released some time in 2013.

In April 2019, Jon and Erich Hoeber signed on to script the film for Paramount Animation while Karen Rosenfelt (&quot;Wonder Park&quot;) and Robert Cort (&quot;Terminator Genisys&quot;) are set to produce. The film will be a live action/animated production. In November 2024, it was announced Matt Lieberman took over as the writer for the film with Ryan Reynolds as the producer and the voice of Mighty Mouse.

==Terrytoons theatrical shorts==
The first seven films starred the character named Super Mouse. In these early films the character&#x27;s costume is much closer in design to that of Superman (blue tunic and tights with red trunks and cape).

In the eighth cartoon, the character&#x27;s name was changed to Mighty Mouse.

==Comics==
Mighty Mouse&#x27;s first comic book appearance was in &quot;Terry-Toons Comics&quot; #38 (November 1945), published by Timely Comics. Mighty Mouse was featured in:

* &quot;Terry-Toons Comics&quot; #38–85 (1945–1951)
* &quot;Paul Terry&#x27;s Comics&quot; #86–125 (1951–1955)

Mighty Mouse was also featured in two main titles by several different publishers: &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Mighty Mouse&quot;.

In 1953, Mighty Mouse was featured in &quot;Three Dimension Comics&quot; #1, the first three-dimensional comics publication, produced by St. John Publications. According to co-creator Joe Kubert, the 3-D issue sold an extraordinary 1.2 million copies at 25 cents each, more than twice the standard comic price of 10 cents.

==DVD releases==
*&quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot;, the first official release of Mighty Mouse material, was released on January 5, 2010.

At least one episode, &quot;Wolf! Wolf!&quot;, has fallen into the public domain and is available at the Internet Archive.

==Controversy==
In 1988, &quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot; was the subject of media controversy when one scene was interpreted as a depiction of cocaine use. In the episode &quot;The Littlest Tramp&quot; a poor mouse girl attempts to sell flowers, and is repeatedly harassed by a rich man who crushes her flowers. She runs out of flowers and makes new ones from sundry items she finds, such as tomato slices, but the man crushes these too. Mighty Mouse attempts to purchase the flowers with his chunk of cheese, and to avenge the girl, but she gives Mighty Mouse the crushed flowers and insists that others need help more than she does. After successfully saving several different characters, he is reminded of the girl, and attempts to smell the flowers she gave him (now a pink powder), inhaling them in the process. He then finds the man that has been harassing the girl, and spanks him. The girl is sympathetic to the man, and he is so moved that the two are married.

A family in Kentucky saw the episode and reportedly interpreted the scene as Mighty Mouse snorting cocaine. The family called the American Family Association in Tupelo, Mississippi. The group demanded Bakshi be removed from production of the series. Bakshi and CBS denied the allegations, Bakshi stating the whole incident &quot;smacks of McCarthyism. I&#x27;m not going to get into who sniffs what. This is lunacy.&quot; To defuse the controversy, Bakshi agreed to cut the 3.5 seconds from the episode. Rev. Donald Wildmon claimed that the editing was a &quot;de facto admission&quot; of cocaine use, though Bakshi maintained that the episode was &quot;totally innocent&quot;.

==Cultural influences==
In the book &quot;Astro Boy Essays&quot;, author Frederik L. Schodt quotes Japanese animator Osamu Tezuka as saying that Mighty Mouse was the influence that inspired him to name his well-known character Mighty Atom (also known as Astro Boy). He also chose to imitate Mighty Mouse&#x27;s signature flying pose with one arm stretched ahead with a clenched fist.

Mighty Mouse was planned to make a cameo in the deleted scene &quot;Acme&#x27;s Funeral&quot; from the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.

Mighty Mouse was featured on famed guitarist Tom Scholz&#x27;s Les Paul guitar.

As part of Andy Kaufman&#x27;s act, he would play the Mighty Mouse theme while standing perfectly still and lip-sync only the line &quot;Here I come to save the day&quot; with great enthusiasm; a 1975 performance of this act on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; is recreated in the 1999 biopic &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;.

===Apple trademark dispute===
On August 2, 2005, Apple released the company&#x27;s first multi-control USB computer mouse. The product was designed by Mitsumi Electric and premiered under the name Apple Mighty Mouse. Apple continued to use the name when the product was redesigned as a Bluetooth device in 2006. Prior to its release, CBS licensed the right to use the Mighty Mouse name to Apple. In 2008, Man and Machine, Inc., a company that produces medical grade, chemical-resistant, mice and keyboards, sued both Apple and CBS for trademark infringement. Man and Machine claimed that it had used the name since 2004 and that CBS did not have the right to license the name for computer peripherals. In 2009, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ruled in favor of Man and Machine and Apple changed the name of its product to the &quot;Apple Mouse&quot;.

<doc id="99306" wikidata="Q668676" url="?curid=99306" title="College Park, Maryland">
<text>College Park is a city in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States, located approximately from the northeast border of Washington, D.C. Its population was 34,740 at the 2020 United States census. It is the home of the University of Maryland, College Park.

College Park is also home to federal agencies such as the National Archives at College Park (Archives II), NOAA&#x27;s Weather Prediction Center, and the FDA&#x27;s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, as well as tech companies such as IonQ (quantum computing) or Cybrary (cyber security).

College Park Airport, established in 1909, is the world&#x27;s oldest continuously operated airport. The College Park Aviation Museum, attached to the airport and an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution, houses antique and reproduction aircraft as well as materials relating to early aviation history.

In 2014, the University of Maryland launched the Greater College Park initiative, a $2 billion public-private investment to &quot;revitalize the community around the university, develop a robust Discovery District and create one of the nation’s best college towns.&quot; As a result, the city is experiencing significant development that has led to new housing, office space, schools, grocery stores, restaurants, and other amenities.

==History==

The earliest evidence of human activity in the College Park area was found at an archeological site just south of Archives II. Projectile points of Clagett and Vernon styles dating from 3000 to 2600 BC were recovered, a notable find given their location away from a river. This finding together with other similar ones indicate that the native American population became more sedentary in the Late Archaic period as the availability of local food supply increased, and social complexity grew. By the time Europeans first arrived and colonized the region in the early 17th century, the various native American groups had aligned themselves into a chiefdom under the Piscataway people.

Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the European settlers lived on large plantations, some holding the original grants under Lord Baltimore. In College Park, there are records for Toaping Castle, a land grant to Col. Isaac Walker from in the area between Branchville, Greenbelt, and Berwyn Heights, and for the Calvert family&#x27;s Riversdale, which included parts of South College Park. One of the oldest buildings in the city, the Old Parish House dating from 1817 was initially a farm building in the latter estate.

===19th century===
The oldest standing building in College Park is the Rossborough Inn, whose construction was completed in 1803. The forerunner of today&#x27;s University of Maryland was chartered in 1856 as the Maryland Agricultural College, and would become a land grant college in February 1864.

The original College Park subdivision was first platted in 1872 by Eugene Campbell. Early maps called the local post office &quot;College Lawn&quot;. The area remained undeveloped and was re-platted in 1889 by John O. Johnson and Samuel Curriden, Washington real estate developers. The original tract was divided into a grid-street pattern with long, narrow building lots, with a standard lot size of . College Park originally included single-family residences constructed in the Shingle, Queen Anne, and Stick styles, as well as modest vernacular dwellings.

By the turn of the century, College Park was being developed rapidly by catering to those who were seeking to escape the crowded Washington, D.C., as well as to a rapidly expanding staff of college faculty and employees.

===20th century===

In 1909 the College Park Airport was established by the United States Army Signal Corps to serve as a training location for Wilbur Wright to instruct military officers to fly in the US government&#x27;s first airplane. Civilian aircraft began flying from College Park Airport as early as December 1911, making it the world&#x27;s oldest continuously operated airport.

Commercial development in the city increased in the 1920s, aided by the increased automobile traffic and the growing campus along Baltimore Avenue/Route 1. By the late 1930s, most of the original subdivision had been partially developed. Several fraternities and sororities from the University of Maryland built houses in the neighborhood. After World War II, construction consisted mostly of infill of ranch and split-level houses. After incorporation in 1945, the city continued to grow, and a municipal center was built in 1959.

The Lakeland neighborhood was developed beginning in 1890 around the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, whose Branchville and Calvert Road depots were located approximately one mile to the north and south, respectively. Lakeland was created by Edwin Newman, who improved the original located to the west of the railroad. He also built a number of the original homes, a small town hall, and a general store. The area was originally envisioned as a resort-type community. However, due to the flood-prone, low-lying topography, the neighborhood became an area of African-American settlement. Around 1900, the Baltimore Gold Fish Company built five artificial lakes in the area to spawn goldfish and rarer species of fish. By 1903 Lakeland was an established African-American community with a school and two churches. Lakeland was central in a group of African American communities located along Route One through Prince Georges County. Lakeland High School opened in 1928 with funding from the Rosenwald Fund, the African American community and the county. Lakeland High served all African American students in the northern half of the county until 1950 when it was converted to a facility for lower grades. The community&#x27;s first Rosenwald school was a new elementary which opened in 1925.

The Berwyn neighborhood was developed beginning about 1885 adjacent to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. It was created by Francis Shannabrook, a Pennsylvanian who purchased a tract of land between Baltimore Avenue and the railroad tracks. Shannabrook established a small depot, built a general store, and erected approximately 15 homes in the area to attract moderate-income families looking to move out of Washington. The neighborhood began to grow after 1900 when the City and Suburban Electric Railway entered the area. By 1925, approximately 100 single-family homes existed, mostly two-story, wood-frame buildings. The community housing continued to develop in the 1930s and 1940s with one story bungalows, Cape Cods, and Victorians and, later, raised ranches and split-level homes.

The Daniels Park neighborhood was developed, beginning in 1905 on the east and west sides of the City and Suburban Electric Railway in north College Park. Daniels Park was created by Edward Daniels on of land. This small residential subdivision was improved with single-family houses arranged along a grid pattern of streets. The houses—built between 1905 and the 1930s—range in style from American Foursquares to bungalows.

The Hollywood neighborhood was developed in the early 20th century along the City and Suburban Electric Railway. Edward Daniels, the developer of Daniels Park, planned the Hollywood subdivision as a northern extension of that earlier community. Development in Hollywood was slow until after World War II, when Albert Turner acquired large tracts of the northern part of the neighborhood in the late 1940s. Turner was able to develop and market brick and frame three-bedroom bungalows beginning in 1950. By 1952, an elementary school had been built. Hollywood Neighborhood Park, a facility along the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line, is operated by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission.

In 1943, due to World War II efforts to conserve rail transport, the Washington Senators relocated their spring training camp to College Park. The locations of 1943 Major League Baseball spring training camps were limited to an area east of the Mississippi River and north of the Ohio River.

During the 1960s through the 1980s an Urban Renewal Project took place within the historic African American community of Lakeland. This project was carried out in the face of the opposition of the community&#x27;s residents and resulted in the redevelopment of approximately two thirds of the community. It displaced 104 of Lakeland&#x27;s 150 households.

The College Park–University of Maryland station opened in 1993, connecting College Park to Washington D.C. by means of Metro. During its construction in the late 1980s, sand and gravel were excavated from the site of an adjacent small lake. In return, Metro built Lake Artemesia on the site, a large recreational area that includes aquatic gardens, fishing piers, and hiker-biker trails.

===21st century===

By the turn of the 21st century, College Park began experiencing significant development pressure. Both students and city residents acknowledged the city&#x27;s lack of amenities and poor sense of place. In 2002, the city and county passed the Route 1 Sector Plan, which allowed and encouraged mixed use development along College Park&#x27;s main roadway. In July 2006, a group of students created &quot;Rethink College Park&quot;—a community group providing a website to share information about development and to encourage public dialogue. Early mixed-used projects along Baltimore Avenue included the View I (2006) and II (2010), Mazza Grandmarc (2010), and the Varsity (2011). In 2013 the College Park City-University Partnership—a nonprofit funded by the University of Maryland and the city of College Park—launched the College Park Academy aiming to improve the perception of local public schools.
Development accelerated after Wallace Loh became the president of the University of Maryland in 2010 and relations between the university and the city improved. It was recognized that the university could not compete if the students, faculty, and staff could not live in College Park so the Greater College Park initiative, a $2 billion public-private investment to revitalize the community around the university aiming to create one of the nation&#x27;s best college towns, was launched in 2014. Some of the developments that occurred as a result of this initiative included the 4-star Hotel at UMD in 2017 and the Cambria in 2018, the first hotels built in the city in over half a century, and the construction of the College Park City Hall in 2021, a joint venture between the city and the university that provides offices for both as well as retail space and a public plaza. This plaza holds music performances, markets, and city events throughout the year that contributed towards the revitalization of College Park&#x27;s downtown. The university also launched the Discovery District, its business and research park, and promoted several mixed-used apartment high-rises such as the Aster (2022) or the Union (2024) that brought along new restaurants, shops, and grocery stores.
This development has been complemented by two major infrastructure projects: the Purple Line, which will provide direct light-rail connections form College Park to Bethesda, Silver Spring, and New Carrolton, and the reconstruction of a portion of Baltimore Avenue into a boulevard with a planted median, new bicycle lanes, and continuous sidewalks. Additionally, the University of Maryland has added several state-of-the-art facilities on their campus, including the Iribe Center for computer science and engineering, the Thurgood Marshall Hall for the public policy school, and the IDEA factory for engineering and entrepreneurship.

On June 9, 2020, the city government passed a &quot;Resolution of the Mayor and Council of the City of College Park Renouncing Systemic Racism and Declaring Support of Black Lives&quot; which recognized harm done to the historic African American community of Lakeland. In it, &quot;the Mayor and Council acknowledge and apologize for our city&#x27;s past history of oppression, particularly with regards to the Lakeland community, and actively seek opportunities for accountability and truth-telling about past injustice, and aggressively seek opportunities for restorative justice&quot;.

On March 2, 2023, Patrick Wojahn, who had served as College Park&#x27;s mayor since 2015, resigned after being arrested on child pornography charges. Wojahn pleaded guilty to over 100 counts and was sentenced to 150 years with 120 years suspended.

On November 8, 2023, the parking lot on the Greenbelt Metro station, adjacent to North College Park, was selected to host the future FBI headquarters. The construction of this facility is expected to further accelerate and consolidate the development of College Park.

==Geography==

It is bordered to the North by Beltsville, to the East by Greenbelt and Berwyn Heights, to the South by Riverdale Park and University Park, and to the West by Hyattsville and Adelphi.

The city straddles two small streams, Paint Branch and Indian Creek. The confluence of these two streams is located on the South-East corner of the city, next to the College Park Airport, and results in the Northeast branch Anacostia river. This river is a tributary of the Anacostia river, which itself is a tributary of the Potomac river that flows into the Chesapeake Bay.

West of Baltimore Avenue lie Lord Calvert Manor, College Park Woods, Crystal Springs, Acerdale (University View), Autoville, Cherry Hill, and Camden. East of the CSX tracks lie College Park Estates and Yarrow.

These neighborhoods are primarily residential. They exhibit a variety of architectural styles including Queen Anne and Colonial Revival, and, in later constructions, American Foursquare, Cape Cod, and bungalow. Commercial activity is concentrated along Baltimore Avenue, Greenbelt Road, and Berwyn Road. Starting in 2017 commercial development also started expanding along Knox Road, Hartwick Road, and Calvert Road.

Additionally, the campus of the University of Maryland occupies 41% of the city&#x27;s surface. The main campus, located west of Baltimore Avenue, is noted for its red-brick Georgian buildings and McKeldin Mall, which is the largest academic mall in the United States. Various film and TV pieces have been filmed on this campus, including &quot;St. Elmo’s Fire&quot;, &quot;Veep&quot;, &quot;National Treasure: Book of Secrets&quot;, or &quot;Young Sheldon&quot;.

In 2017 the university rebranded its 150-acre business and research park as the Discovery district aiming to bring together research firms, start-ups and shops and restaurants. This area is divided between College Park and Riverdale Park.

This Discovery district is home to federal agencies such as the NOAA&#x27;s Weather Prediction Center, the FDA&#x27;s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), and the navy&#x27;s software factory (the &quot;Forge&quot;), as well as university centers such as the Applied Research Laboratory for Intelligence and Security (ARLIS) sponsored by the Department of Defense.

The Discovery district also includes technology companies generally related to the university. An area that has seen rapid growth in the Discovery district since 2010 is quantum technology. Efforts in this field include IonQ, a quantum computing company with a market capitalization of $2.8 billion as of December 2023, Quantum Startup Foundry, Quantum Catalyzer, and the National Quantum Lab at Maryland (Q-Lab), the nation&#x27;s first facility providing hands-on access to a commercial-grade quantum computer to the scientific community. These efforts are part of the university&#x27;s campaign to further establish the area as the &quot;capital of quantum&quot;.

Other sectors with a strong presence in the Discovery district are cyber security (Cybrary, Immuta, BlueVoyand, and Inky) and medical devices (Medcura). On December 18, 2023, the Washington Commanders announced that they would be moving their headquarters to the Discovery district in 2024.

<text>English Heritage (officially the English Heritage Trust) is a charity that manages over 400 historic monuments, buildings and places. These include prehistoric sites, medieval castles, Roman forts, and country houses.

The charity states that it uses these properties to &quot;bring the story of England to life for over 10 million people each year&quot;. Within its portfolio are Stonehenge, Dover Castle, Tintagel Castle, and the &quot;best-preserved&quot; parts of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. English Heritage also manages the London blue plaque scheme, which links influential historical figures to particular buildings.

When originally formed in 1983, English Heritage was the operating name of an executive non-departmental public body of the British Government, officially titled the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England, that ran the national system of heritage protection and managed a range of historic properties. It was created to combine the roles of existing bodies that had emerged from a long period of state involvement in heritage protection. In 1999, the organisation merged with the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England and the National Monuments Record, bringing together resources for the identification and survey of England&#x27;s historic environment.

On 1 April 2015, English Heritage was divided into two parts: Historic England, which inherited the statutory and protection functions of the old organisation, and the new English Heritage Trust, a charity that would operate the historic properties, and which took on the English Heritage operating name and logo. The British government gave the new charity an £80 million grant to help establish it as an independent trust, although the historic properties remain in the ownership of the state.

==History==

===Non-departmental public body===
Over the centuries, what is now called &quot;heritage&quot; has been the responsibility of a series of state departments. There was the &quot;Kings Works&quot; after the Norman Conquest, the Office of Works (1378–1832), the Office of Woods, Forests, Land Revenues and Works (1832–1851), and the Ministry of Works (1851–1962). Responsibility subsequently transferred to the Ministry of Public Building and Works (1962–1970), then to the Department of the Environment (1970–1997), and it is now with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). The state&#x27;s legal responsibility for the historic environment goes back to the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882. The central government subsequently developed several systems of heritage protection for different types of assets, introducing listing for buildings after the Second World War, and for conservation areas in the 1960s.

In 1983, Secretary of State for the Environment Michael Heseltine gave national responsibility for the historic environment to a semi‑autonomous agency (or &quot;quango&quot;) to operate under ministerial guidelines and to government policy. The Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission was formed under the terms of the National Heritage Act 1983 on 1 April 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;2013/14 Annual Report&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The 1983 Act also dissolved the bodies that had previously provided independent advice – the Ancient Monuments Board for England and the Historic Buildings Council for England – and incorporated those functions into the new body. Soon after, the commission was given the operating name of English Heritage by its first chairman, Lord Montagu of Beaulieu.

A national register of historic parks and gardens, (e.g. Rangers House, Greenwich) was set up in 1984, and a register for historic battlefields (e.g. the Battle of Tewkesbury) was created in March 1995. &#x27;Registration&#x27; is a material consideration in the planning process. In April 1999 English Heritage merged with the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England (RCHME) and the National Monuments Record (NMR), bringing together resources for the identification and survey of England&#x27;s historic environment. By adoption, that included responsibility for the national record of archaeological sites from the Ordnance Survey, the National Library of Aerial Photographs, and two million RAF and Ordnance Survey aerial photographs. Those, together with other nationally important external acquisitions, meant that English Heritage was one of the largest publicly accessible archives in the UK: 2.53 million records are available online, including more than 426,000 images. In 2010–11, it recorded 4.3 million unique online user sessions and over 110,000 people visited NMR exhibitions held around the country in 2009–10. In 2012, the section responsible for archive collections was renamed the English Heritage Archive.

As a result of the National Heritage Act 2002, English Heritage acquired administrative responsibility for historic wrecks and submerged landscapes within of the English coast. The administration of the listed building system was transferred from DCMS to English Heritage in 2006. However, actual listing decisions still remained the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, who was required by the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 to approve a list of buildings of special architectural or historic interest.

Following the Public Bodies Reform in 2010, English Heritage was confirmed as the government&#x27;s statutory adviser on the historic environment, and the largest source of non-lottery grant funding for heritage assets. It was retained on grounds of &quot;performing a technical function which should remain independent from Government&quot;. However, the department also suffered from budget cuts during the recession of the 2010s, resulting in a repairs deficit of £100 million.

===Charitable trust===
In June 2013 the British Government announced plans to provide an £80 million grant to enable English Heritage to become a self-financing charity (roughly following the precedent set by the transformation of the nationally owned British Waterways into the Canal &amp; River Trust). The national portfolio of historic properties remain in public ownership, but the new English Heritage will be licensed to manage them.

The change occurred on 1 April 2015 with the statutory planning and heritage protection functions remaining an independent, non-departmental public body, rebranded as Historic England. The care of the properties in the National Collection and the visitor experience attached to them were transferred to the new English Heritage Trust, although the English Heritage name and logo remains. The new trust has a licence to operate the properties until 2025.

== National Collection ==


English Heritage is the guardian of over 400 sites and monuments, the most famous of which include Stonehenge, Osborne, Iron Bridge and Dover Castle. Whilst many have an entry charge, more than 250 properties are free to enter including Maiden Castle, Dorset and St Catherine&#x27;s Oratory.

The sites are part of the portfolio of over 880 historical places across the UK amassed by the British Government between the 1880s and the 1970s to form the National Collection of built and archaeological heritage. (The balance is in the care of Historic Scotland and Cadw.) These sites represent a deliberate attempt by the state in the 19th and early 20th century to take the nation&#x27;s most significant prehistoric sites and medieval sites, which were no longer in active use, into public ownership. This national property collection performs the same function as pictures in the National Gallery and the archaeological material in the British Museum.

Unlike the National Trust, English Heritage holds few furnished properties, although Charles Darwin&#x27;s home at Down, Kent (where he wrote &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;) and Brodsworth Hall, South Yorkshire are major exceptions to this. New sites are rarely added to the collection as other charities and institutions are now encouraged to care for them and open them to the public. Recent acquisitions include Harmondsworth Barn in west London, close to Heathrow airport, in late 2011 and Carrawburgh Roman Fort in January 2020.

The properties are held by English Heritage under various arrangements. The majority are in the guardianship of the Secretary of State for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, with the freehold being retained by the owner. The remaining properties are owned either by English Heritage, other government departments or the Crown Estate.

In 2013–14 there were 5.73 million visits to staffed sites, with 713,000 free educational visits to sites, collections and tailored learning activities and resources.

In February 2024, English Heritage reported that the previous year had seen record numbers of families visiting their sites, with numbers up 50% over the past decade. 2023 also proved to be a record-breaking year for a number of sites, such as Tintagel Castle.

==Selected collection highlights==
==Funding==
As a charitable trust, English Heritage relies on the income generated from admission fees to its properties, membership fees and trading income from (e.g.) catering, holiday cottages and shops. It also has income from fundraising and grants. To ease the transition, the government has supplied a total of £80 million in yearly subsidies until 2023 to cover the backlog of maintenance to the sites in English Heritage&#x27;s care.

Previously, when English Heritage was a non-departmental public body and included the functions of planning, listing, awarding grants, heritage research and advice, most of its funding came from government. In 2013–2014, English Heritage had a total income of £186.55 million, of which £99.85 million came from grant-in-aid, with the remaining £86.7 million from earned sources. This included £17.47 million from property admissions, £14.96 million from catering and retail, £22.91 million from membership and £26.39 million from donations and grants.

The trust&#x27;s financial plan saw the annual requirement for subsidy being cut from £15.6 million in 2015/16 to £10.1 million in 2020/21 and zero in 2022/23.

==Membership==
Members of the public are encouraged to join English Heritage as &quot;members&quot;. Membership provides benefits such as free admission to its properties and member-only events as well as reduced-cost admission to associated properties. Members also get access for free or reduced cost to properties managed by Cadw in Wales, Historic Scotland, the Office of Public Works in the Republic of Ireland, Manx National Heritage on the Isle of Man and Heritage New Zealand. In 2014/15 there were 1.34 million members.&lt;ref name=&quot;2014/15 Annual Report&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, membership does not convey voting rights or influence over the way English Heritage is run.

Participation in consultations and web-based surveys by English Heritage is not restricted to its membership. It invites various groups and members of the public to give views on specific issues, most notably in recent years about the Stonehenge road tunnel project proposals.

==Volunteering==
The organisation welcomes volunteers. Roles range from room stewarding, running education workshops and gardening, to curatorial cleaning and research.

In 2014/15 the number of regular volunteers reached 1,872, up from 1,473 in 2013/14.

=== 1066 March ===
In 2016, to mark the 950th anniversary of the Battle of Hastings and the Norman Conquest of 1066, English Heritage organised the 1066 March from Clifford&#x27;s Tower in York to Battle Abbey in East Sussex. A team of volunteers led by Nigel Amos and composed of Dominic Sewell, Brian Mahoney, Joshua Powell, William Ballance, Lucy Amos, Karlos Moir, Clive Hart and Matthew Clarke, completed the journey over 3 weeks, arriving at Battle Abbey on 14 October 2016.

==Management and governance==

English Heritage is governed by a trustee board who set the strategic direction of the organisation and ensure that the organisation delivers its goals and objectives. It is led by the chairman, currently Gerard Lemos. Other trustees are Sarah Staniforth, Vicky Barnsley, Kay Boycott, Liz Bromley, Tony Cates, Tanvi Gokhale, Sir Laurie Magnus, Kunle Olulode, Sue Wilkinson and William Whyte.

Operational management is delegated to the chief executive, Nick Merriman. The chief executive is supported by an executive board of eight directors.

In 2013/14, prior to becoming a charity, English Heritage employed 2,578 staff.

==Blue plaque==

English Heritage has administered the blue plaque scheme in London since 1986. The plaques mark buildings in the capital that were the homes of (or otherwise associated with) people of historical significance. The scheme remains the responsibility of English Heritage following the transfer to the voluntary sector in 2015.

For a short period from 1998 English Heritage trialled plaques outside the Greater London area. Plaques were erected in Merseyside, Birmingham and elsewhere; but the scheme was discontinued in 2005.

Many other plaques have been erected throughout the UK (including London) by town councils, district councils, civic societies, historical societies, fan clubs, companies, and individuals. These are not managed or require approval from English Heritage. An open register is available at Open Plaques.

==Controversies==

===English Heritage sites in Cornwall===
In 1999 a pressure group, the Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament, wrote to English Heritage asking them to remove all signs bearing their name from Cornish sites by July 1999 as they regarded the ancient sites as Cornish heritage, not English. Over a period of eleven months members of the Cornish Stannary removed 18 signs and a letter was sent to English Heritage saying &quot;The signs have been confiscated and held as evidence of English cultural aggression in Cornwall. Such racially motivated signs are deeply offensive and cause distress to many Cornish people&quot;. On 18 January 2002, at Truro Crown Court, after the prosecution successfully applied for a Public Immunity Certificate to suppress defence evidence (these are normally issued in cases involving national security), three members of the group agreed to return the signs and pay £4,500 in compensation to English Heritage and to be bound over to keep the peace. In return, the prosecution dropped charges of conspiracy to cause criminal damage.

In 2011, Conservative MP George Eustice stated that Cornish heritage &quot;is not English&quot; and that there is &quot;a growing feeling that Cornwall should have its own heritage organisation, taking over from English Heritage.&quot; He suggested that English Heritage be replaced &quot;with a Cornish Heritage group, just like they have for instance in Wales and Scotland&quot;. The then Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt was called upon to give cash to a new autonomous body in Cornwall by &quot;top slicing&quot; English Heritage&#x27;s budget.

===Fortress House===

In 2006, the Secretary of State at the DCMS issued a certificate of exemption from listing for Fortress House, the then English Heritage headquarters. In 2009, it was demolished and the site redeveloped for a commercial office building.

===Photography===
In 2010 the organisation sent an email to open access photograph agency fotoLibra, attempting to ban the unauthorised commercial use of photographs of Stonehenge. A subsequent statement of regret was issued, clarifying that &quot;We do not control the copyright of all images of Stonehenge and have never tried to do so.&quot; The organisation added that they request that commercial photographers pay fees and abide by certain conditions.

==Youth engagement ==
Since 2018, English Heritage&#x27;s highly successful national youth engagement project, Shout Out Loud, has provided a platform for young people to explore heritage sites and collections across England, helping them to uncover untold stories from our past. By amplifying their voices, the now permanent youth engagement programme continues to put young people&#x27;s ideas and stories at the heart of English Heritage, engendering feelings of inclusion and relevance via increased representation and creative opportunities for involvement. Shout Out Loud was originally funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund as part of Kick the Dust.

Shout Out Loud established a successful consortium of partners between 2018 and 2022 including Photoworks, the Council for British Archaeology, National Youth Theatre and Sound Connections. A number of high-profile projects were delivered with these partners including: Reverberate, a project aimed at connecting grassroot youth organisations with their local heritage (with Sound Connections); England&#x27;s New Lenses, a photography project resulting in new bodies of work connected to English Heritage sites from four emerging photographers (with Photoworks); &#x27;The Ancestors&#x27;, a performance based project exploring Black prisoners of War at Portchester Castle (with the National Youth Theatre and Warwick University) and &#x27;Our House&#x27;, exploring LGBTQ+ history at Eltham Palace (with the National Youth Theatre and Metro Charity); &#x27;From Ordinary to Extraordinary&#x27;, a project supporting national Young Archaeologists&#x27; Clubs to creatively explore and share their local history with new audiences (with the Council for British Archaeology).

Shout Out Loud was awarded the 2019 UK Heritage Award for Best Event, Festival or Exhibition for &#x27;Our House&#x27; and shortlisted for the 2022 Museums and Heritage Award for Community Engagement Programme of the Year for the programme as a whole.

Young People are able to get involved with the ongoing youth engagement programme via online mass participation projects, creative residency or participation opportunities (often shared on the dedicated Instagram channel @eh_shoutoutloud), via projects as part of a youth group, or by joining one of the ongoing schemes &#x27;Young Associates&#x27; (ages 16–25, no application necessary, join at any time) or Young Producers (ages 18–25, applications open once a year). Paid six month placement opportunities are also available once or twice per year. Previous placement holders have gone on to positions with the BBC, The National Archives, Netflix, Warner Brothers and the National Trust.
