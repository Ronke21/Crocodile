<text>Coltan (short for columbite–tantalites and known industrially as tantalite) is a dull black metallic ore from which the elements niobium and tantalum are extracted. The niobium-dominant mineral in coltan is columbite (after niobium&#x27;s original American name &quot;columbium&quot;), and the tantalum-dominant mineral is tantalite.

Tantalum from coltan is used to manufacture tantalum capacitors which are used for mobile phones, personal computers, automotive electronics, and cameras. Coltan mining is widespread in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

== Production and supply ==

Approximately 71% of the global tantalum supply in 2008 was newly mined, 20% was from recycling, and the remainder was from tin slag and inventory. Tantalum minerals are mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Colombia, Rwanda, Australia, Brazil, China, Ethiopia, Mozambique and Kenya. Tantalum is also produced in Thailand and Malaysia as a by-product of tin mining and smelting. Potential future mines, in descending order of magnitude, are being explored in Egypt, Greenland, China, Australia, Finland, Canada, Nigeria and Brazil.

Globally, 60% of all mining companies have registered with the highly regulated stock exchanges in Toronto and Vancouver. However, due to environmental regulations, no mining of coltan is currently taking place in Canada itself, with the exception of a single proposed mine in Blue River, British Columbia. In Canada, Tanco Mine near Bernic Lake in Manitoba has tantalum reserves, is the world&#x27;s largest producer of caesium, and is operated by Global Advanced Metals Pty Ltd. A discussion of Canadian mining by Natural Resources Canada, updated in 2017, does not mention either coltan or tantalum. A Rwandan official discussing prospective mines in his country said that Canada had 4% of global production in 2009; but in rock so hard that the ore is too expensive to extract. In 2009, Rwanda had 9% of the world&#x27;s tantalum production.

In 2016, Rwanda accounted for 50% of global tantalum production. In 2016, Rwanda announced that AB Minerals Corporation would open a coltan separation plant in Rwanda by mid-2017, the first to operate on the African continent. Uganda and Rwanda both exported coltan in the early 2000s after they invaded the DRC, but the bulk of this coltan was not mined within those countries but smuggled from Congolese mines, according to the final report of the UN Panel of Experts on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources and Other Forms of Wealth in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

In 2013, Highland African Mining Company (HAMC), now Noventa, closed its Marropino mine in the Gilé District of Zambézia Province, Mozambique, citing poor-quality infrastructure and ore that was both very radioactive and mostly depleted. HAMC was losing US$3.00 on every ton extracted and had reported accumulated losses of around US$150 million by June 2013.

Reserves have been identified in Afghanistan, but the ongoing war there precludes either general exploration or exploring specifically for coltan for the foreseeable future. The United States does not produce tantalum due to the poor quality of its reserves.

Australian mining company Sons of Gwalia once produced half the world&#x27;s tantalum but went into administration in 2004. Talison Minerals paid $205 million to buy the Wodgina and Greenbushes tantalum business of Sons of Gwalia but temporarily closed Wodgina because of falling tantalum prices. The mine re-opened in 2011 but closed again after less than a year. Atlas Iron began mining iron ore there in 2010 and ceased operations there in April 2017. Global Advanced Mining announced in 2018 that it planned to restart tantalum production at the Greenbushes mine within a year. Talison Lithium, 51% owned by Chinese company Tianqi Lithium Industries, Inc. (SZSE:002466) and 49% by the US-based Albemarle Corporation, will continue to mine lithium at Greenbushes in parallel with the GAM tantalum operation.

Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez announced in 2009 that a significant reserve of coltan was discovered in western Venezuela, although at least one coltan mining operation had previously been authorized in the area. Nonetheless, he outlawed private mines in the region and, saying that the FARC was financing itself with illegal mining, sent 15,000 troops in to deal with them. Technical advisers for the mining project were allegedly provided by a subsidiary of Khatam-al Anbiya Construction Headquarters, a fully owned enterprise of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard which had been under US sanctions since October 25, 2007.

Also in 2009, the Colombian government announced coltan reserves had been found in Colombia&#x27;s eastern provinces. Director of the Colombian Police Oscar Naranjo Trujillo stated in October 2011 that the FARC and the Sinaloa Cartel are working together in the unlicensed coltan mining in Colombia. Colombia announced a joint operation with the United States to arrest three suspects who, according to &quot;Semana&quot;, inherited the illegal business run from their brother, Francisco Cifuentes Villa, alias &#x27;Pancho Cifuentes&#x27;, who once worked for Pablo Escobar. In 2012 Colombian police seized 17 tons of coltan in Guainía Department. The police said it had been mined on an indigenous reserve and bought for $10 a kilo and sold for $80 to 100 dollars a kilo, after smuggling it across the border into Brazil, where there are smelters, and sold on through the black market to buyers in Germany, Belgium, Kazakhstan and the United States. Colombia has 5% of global coltan reserves. One of the regions suffering from illegal gold and coltan mining in Colombia is the wetland known as Estrella Fluvial del Inírida (Inírida Fluvial Star), a Ramsar protected wetland.



== Use and demand ==
Coltan is used primarily for the production of tantalum capacitors, used in mobile phones and almost every kind of electronic device. Niobium and tantalum have a wide range of uses, including refractive lenses for glasses, cameras, phones and printers. They are also used in semiconductor circuits, and capacitors for small electronic devices such as hearing aids, pacemakers, and MP3 players, as well as in computer hard drives, automobile electronics, and surface acoustic wave SAW filters for mobile phones.

Coltan is also used to make high-temperature alloys for jet engines, air-based turbines, and land-based turbines. More recently, in the late 2000s, the nickel-tantalum super-alloys used in jet engines account for 15% of tantalum consumption, but pending orders for the Airbus and the 787 Dreamliner may increase this proportion, as well as China&#x27;s pending order for 62 787-8 airplanes.

In 2012, electronics companies that used coltan included Acer Inc., AMP, Apple Inc., Canon Inc., Dell, HP Inc., HTC, IBM, Intel, Lenovo, LG, Microsoft, Motorola, Nikon, Nintendo, Nokia, Panasonic, Philips, RIM (now Blackberry Limited), Samsung, Sandisk, Sharp Corporation, Sony, and Toshiba. Some companies have taken steps to reduce their use of conflict minerals by tracing the source of minerals in their supply chains, auditing smelters, and certifying conflict-free coltan mines. As of 2012, the companies that lagged behind these efforts the most were Nintendo, HTC, Sharp Corporation, Nikon, and Canon Inc.

=== Resource curse ===

Certain countries rich in natural resources have been said to suffer from the apparently paradoxical &quot;resource curse&quot; - showing &quot;worse&quot; economic development than countries with &quot;fewer&quot; resources. Wealth of resources may also correspond to &quot;... the likelihood of weak democratic development, corruption, and civil war&quot;. High levels of corruption lead to great political instability because whoever controls the assets (usually the political leaders and the government, in the case of the Democratic Republic of the Congo) can use them for their own benefit. The resources generate wealth, which the leaders use to stay in power &quot;... either through legal means, or coercive ones (e.g. funding militias)&quot;. The increased importance of coltan in electronics &quot;occurred as warlords and armies in the eastern Congo converted artisanal mining operations ... into slave labour regimes to earn hard currency to finance their militias,&quot; as one anthropological study put it in 2008. When much of eastern Congo came under the control of Rwandan forces in the 1990s, Rwanda suddenly became a major exporter of coltan, benefiting from the weakness of the Congolese government. The soaring price &quot;brought in as much as $20 million a month to rebel groups&quot; and other factions trading coltan mined in northeastern Congo, according to a U.N. report.

=== Mining ===
For Congolese, mining is the readiest source of income, because the work is consistently available, even if only for a dollar a day. The work can be laborious; miners can walk for days into the forest to reach the ore, scratch it from the earth with hand tools, and pan it. About 90% of young men in Congo have done this. Research found that many Congolese leave farming because they need money quickly and cannot wait for crops to grow. Farming also presents its own obstacles. For example, the lack of roads in the Congolese interior makes it extremely difficult to transport produce to market and a harvest can be seized by militias or the military. With their food gone, people resort to mining to survive. But organized mines may be run by corrupt groups such as militias. The Congolese mine coltan with few tools, no safety procedures, and often no mining experience. No government aid or intervention is available in many unethical and abusive circumstances. Miners consider coltan mining a way to provide for themselves in the face of widespread war and conflict and a government that has no concern for their welfare.

A 2007 study of the radioactivity of the coltan mined in Masisi and other parts of the North Kivu Province found &quot;that grinding and sieving coltan can give rise to high occupational doses, up to 18 mSv per year on average.&quot;

== Ethics of mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo ==

Conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have made it difficult for the DRC to benefit from the exploitation of its coltan reserves. Mining of coltan is mainly artisanal and small-scale and vulnerable to extortion and human trafficking. A 2003 UN Security Council report stated that much of the ore is mined illegally and smuggled across Congo&#x27;s eastern border by militias from neighbouring Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda. All three countries named by the United Nations as coltan smugglers denied doing this. Austrian journalist however has documented links between multi-national companies like Bayer and the smuggling and illegal coltan mines. A United Nations committee investigating the plunder of gems and minerals from the Congo, listed in its final report in 2003 approximately 125 companies and individuals whose business activities breach international norms. Companies accused of irresponsible corporate behavior included Cabot Corporation, Eagle Wings Resources International the Forrest Group and OM Group. Some of the fighters were eventually tried before the International Criminal Court tribunal in The Hague on charges of crimes against humanity.

Income from coltan smuggling likely financed the military occupation of Congo, and prolonged the civil conflict afterwards. A UN panel studied the eastern Congo for months before releasing a remarkably sharp condemnation of the ongoing military occupation of eastern Congo by Ugandan, Rwandan, and other foreign military forces, as well as the many bands of Congolese rebels fighting with one another. The UN report accused the fighters of massively looting Congolese natural resources, and said that the war persisted because the fighters were enriching themselves by mining and smuggling out coltan, timber, gold, and diamonds. They also said that smuggled minerals financed the fighting and provided money for weapons. A 2005 report on the Rwandan economy by the South African Institute for Security Studies found that Rwanda official coltan production soared nearly tenfold between 1999 and 2001, from 147 tons to 1,300 tons, and for the first time provided more revenue than from the country traditional primary exports, tea and coffee. Similarly, Uganda exported 2.5 tons of coltan exports a year before the conflict broke out in 1997. In 1999 its export volume exploded to nearly 70 tons.

Many of the corporations participating in the 1999-2000 business stampede caused by $400 coltan were in fact participants in the conflict. The Rwandan army, as Rwanda Metals, exported at least 100 tons per month. A UN panel estimated that the Coltan extraction causes problems that adjoin or overlap those caused by blood diamonds and uses similar methods such as smuggling across the porous Rwandan border, environmentalists and human rights workers began to speak of &quot;conflict minerals&quot; or &quot;conflict resources&quot; more generally. It is difficult to verify the sourcing of fungible materials like ores, so some processors, Cabot Corporation (USA) for example, have announced that they would avoid unsourced Central African coltan altogether. The Rwandan army could have made $20 million a month, and must have made at least $250 million over 18 months. &quot;This is substantial enough to finance the war,&quot; the panel noted in its report.

In 2009, DRC coltan was going to China to be manufactured into wires and electronic-grade tantalum powder. Coltan imports from the DRC into Europe usually went to Russia or Central/Eastern Europe, via the route through Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and Piraeus in Greece to the Balkans. An offshore consortium registered in the British Virgin Islands named Nova Dies controlled most of the trans-Balkan trade route. This export pipeline mostly carries unprocessed coltan mined in unsafe artisanal mines, so this market hinders development of safer extraction infrastructure in the DRC. The Balkan trade route, therefore, poses a long-term threat to the DRC&#x27;s economy; it finances and validates the vast harm done to DR Congo by the violent and corrupt past and current system.

Estimates of Congo&#x27;s coltan deposits range upwards from 64% of global reserves. but estimates at the high end of the range are difficult to trace to reliable data. Professional bodies like the British Geological Survey estimate that Central Africa as a whole has 9% of global assets. Tantalum, the primary element extracted from coltan, can also be obtained from other sources, but Congolese coltan represented around 10% of world production in 2008.

The United States responded to conflict minerals with section 1501 of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which required companies that might have conflict minerals including Coltan in their supply chain to register with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and disclose their suppliers. The legislation appears to have had limited success. Based on extensive qualitative fieldwork conducted from 2014 to 2016 with coltan buyers operating in Bukama Territory, Kalemie and Lubumbashi, Katanga Province, one researcher suggested that conflict mineral reforms resulted in better oversight and organization of supply chains, but that inaction by the Congolese government had led to locally negotiated solutions and territorialization, leading to secretive mining activities.

== Environmental concerns ==
Uncontrolled mining in the DRC causes soil erosion and pollutes lakes and rivers, affecting the hydrology and ecology of the region.

The eastern mountain gorilla&#x27;s population has diminished as well. Miners, far from food sources and often hungry, hunt gorillas. The gorilla population in the DRC fell from 17,000 to 5,000 in the decade prior to 2009, and Mountain Gorillas in the Great Lakes region numbered only 700, UNEP said in 2009. Hunted for bushmeat, a prized delicacy in western Africa, and threatened by logging, slash-and-burn agriculture and armed conflict, the gorilla population was critically endangered, they said. The population of Grauer&#x27;s gorillas were particularly threatened by changes in their environment, with a population in January 2018 of only about 3,800.

An estimated 3–5 million tons of bushmeat is obtained by killing animals, including gorillas, every year. Demand for bushmeat comes from urban dwellers who consider it a delicacy, as well as from remote populations of artisanal miners. Environmentalists who interviewed miners in and around Kahuzi-Biéga National Park and the Itombwe Nature Reserve found that the miners did confirm that they had been eating bushmeat and that they did think that the practice had caused a decline in primate numbers. Since the miners said they would cease the practice if they had another food supply, the authors suggested that efforts to stop the gorilla population decline should consider addressing this issue to reduce the depredations of subsistence hunting. The mines in these nature reserves were producing cassiterite, gold, coltan and wolframite, and &quot;most mines were controlled by armed groups.&quot;

== Health concerns ==
There is a high prevalence of respiratory complaints in Congolese informal coltan miners. It has been suggested that efficient occupational safety measures be implemented. Also, there is a need to regulate the informal mining business due to a high death toll.

== Price increases and changes in demand ==
The production and sale of coltan and niobium from African mines dropped significantly after the dramatic price spike in 2000 from the dot-com frenzy, from $400 to the current price level of around $100. Figures from the United States Geological Survey partially confirm this. The Tantalum-Niobium International Study Centre in Belgium, the country that colonized the DRC, has encouraged international buyers to avoid Congolese coltan on ethical grounds: &quot;take care in obtaining ... raw materials from lawful sources. Harm, or the threat of harm, to local people, wildlife or the environment is unacceptable.&quot;

In addition to environmental harm caused by erosion, pollution and deforestation, agriculture and as a result food security suffered in the DRC as a result of mining. A follow-up UN report in 2003 noted a sharp increase in 1999 and 2000 in the global price of tantalum, which naturally increased coltan production. Some of the increased production came from eastern DC where there are &quot;rebel groups and unscrupulous business people&quot; forcing farmers and their families to leave land where the rebels wanted to mine, &quot;forcing them to work in artisanal mines...widespread destruction of agriculture and devastating social effects occurred, which in a number of instances were akin to slavery.&quot;

A shift also took place from traditional sources such as Australia to new suppliers such as Egypt, perhaps because of the bankruptcy of the world&#x27;s biggest supplier, Australia&#x27;s Sons of Gwalia may have caused or contributed to this change. The operations previously owned by Gwalia in Wodgina and Greenbushes continue to operate in some capacity.

<text>Solna ( or , ), also known as Solna Municipality, is a municipality in central Stockholm County, Sweden, located just north of Stockholm City Centre. Its seat is located in the town of Solna, which is a part of the Stockholm urban area. Solna is one of the richest municipalities in Sweden.

The municipality is a part of Metropolitan Stockholm. None of the area is considered rural, which is unusual for Swedish municipalities, which normally are of mixed rural/urban character. Solna is the third smallest municipality in Sweden in terms of area, after nearby Sundbyberg, as well as Burlöv, Scania County.

Solna borders Stockholm Municipality to the south, southeast and northwest; to Sundbyberg Municipality to the west; to Sollentuna Municipality to the north; and to Danderyd Municipality to the northeast. The boundary with Danderyd Municipality is delineated by the Stocksundet strait.

There are two parishes in Solna Municipality: Råsunda (population 29,677) and Solna (population 28,317). Solna Parish once included parts of present-day City of Stockholm.

Solna is divided into eight traditional parts with no administrative functions: Bergshamra, Haga, Hagalund, Huvudsta, Järva, Råsunda, Skytteholm and Ulriksdal. The largest districts are Råsunda, Hagalund and Huvudsta, with the Solna Centrum in between them.

With few exceptions, Solna&#x27;s built-up areas have a suburban character, but there are also several large parks and Strawberry Arena, Sweden&#x27;s new national football stadium adjacent to the Solna station of Stockholm commuter rail.

The final matches of both the 1958 FIFA (men&#x27;s) World Cup and the 1995 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup were played at Råsunda Stadium, the national football stadium from 1937 to 2012 (demolished in 2013).

Solna has attracted a wide range of businesses and authorities, making it a major place of work in Greater Stockholm. Among the most important employers are the medical university Karolinska Institutet and the Karolinska University Hospital. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) are also located in Solna.

<text>Drottningholm, literally &quot;Queen&#x27;s Islet&quot;, is a locality situated in Ekerö Municipality, Stockholm County, Sweden, with 398 inhabitants in 2010.

It is on the island Lovön in lake Mälaren on the outskirts of Stockholm. Drottningholm Palace, the residence of the Swedish royal family since 1981, is here. The village was planned and built in the mid-18th century for the people working at the palace. It is a good example of how a Swedish village would have looked like in the 18th and 19th centuries, containing many picturesque houses and villas.

Drottningholm is accessible with public transport by taking the metro to Brommaplan, then an Ekerö-bound SL bus.

==Ships==
At least two ships have been named &quot;Drottningholm&quot;. One is the former ferry that was built in 1909 and is now a listed historic ship of Sweden. Another was the transatlantic ocean liner RMS &quot;Virginian&quot;, which Swedish American Line bought in 1920 and renamed .

Among English speakers, the liner&#x27;s unfortunate tendency to roll inspired the nicknames &quot;Rollingholm&quot; or &quot;Rollinghome&quot;. In the Second World War she was chartered to repatriate thousands of released prisoners of war, civilian internees and diplomats. Among them the English speakers nicknamed her &quot;Trotting Home&quot;.

<text>In Cook Islands mythology, Avatea (also known as Vatea; meaning &#x27;noon&#x27; or &#x27;light&#x27;) was a lunar deity and the father of gods and men in Mangaian myth of origin. His eyes were thought to be the Sun and the Moon; he was also known as the god of light.

==Mythology==
According to one myth, Vari-Ma-Te-Takere (The primordial mother) created six children from her body. Three were plucked from her right side and three from her left. The first of which was Avatea, the first man, who was perceived as a moon god. As he grew he divided vertically into a hybrid being; the right half was a man and the left half a fish.

In song, the gods are called &quot;children of Vatea&quot;. The same shortened phrase is in use at Rarotonga: at Aitutaki and Atiu the full form &quot;Avatea&quot; is used, e.g. &quot;kia kakā te mata o Avatea Nui&quot; meaning &quot;when the eye of Great Avatea is open;&quot; in other words &quot;when the sun is in its full glory;&quot; still in contrast with the darkness and gloom of Avaiki, or the Underworld.

In Mangaian myth, a beautiful woman visits Vatea in his dreams, and he is certain that she ascends from the underworld to his side, but when he wakes he can never find her. He strews scraped coconut about, and, at last, watchers see a slender hand reach for the delicious food. Vatea catches her and discovers that her name is Papa, and marries her. Tangaroa and Rongo are their twin sons. Rongo&#x27;s wife bears a daughter named Tavake. Tavake gives birth to Rangi, Mokoiro, and to Akatauira. Rangi pulls up Mangaia from the underworld, and becomes the first king of the island. His wife&#x27;s name is Te-po-tatango.

<doc id="95922" wikidata="Q7259566" url="?curid=95922" title="Pulotu">
<text>Pulotu is the resting place of those passed on in the Polynesian narrative of Tonga and Samoa, the world of darkness &quot;lalo fonua&quot; (as opposed to the human world of light).

==Name==
The term is related to Fijian &quot;Burotu&quot;. It goes back to Proto-Polynesian &quot;*pulotu&quot;, from Proto-Central Pacific &quot;*burotu&quot;.

==Tonga==

In the Tongan narrative, Pulotu is presided over by Havea Hikuleʻo. In Tongan cosmology the sky, the sea, and Pulotu existed from the beginning, and the gods lived there. The first land they made for the people was Touiaʻifutuna &quot;trapped in Futuna&quot;, which was only a rock. There are suggestions that for Tonga and Samoa, Pulotu refers to a real country, in fact Matuku Island in the Lau Islands. The old name of Matuku Island is Burotu. However, there is no signs of underwater civilization in the Matuku waters where they said that Burotu once laid. But new evidence suggest Pulotu is situated in Moturiki belonging to Fiji’s Lomaiviti 
Archipelago.

After the independence struggle by Hikuleʻo and his cousins Maui Motuʻa and Tangaloa ʻEiki, they renamed Touiaʻifutuna into Tongamamaʻo. Only after that the other islands were made (the volcanic islands by Hikuleʻo and the coral islands by Maui). Finally, Tongamamaʻo was renamed, for the last time, as Tonga.

Hikuleʻo is supposed to have married a daughter of Tangaloa ʻEiki.

==Samoa==
In the mythology of Samoa, Pulotu is presided over by the god Saveasi&#x27;uleo (also referred to as Elo), whose name reveals a similarity to the Tongan god Havea Hikuleo. Saveasi&#x27;uleo is the father of Nafanua the Goddess of War in Samoa, from the village of Falealupo, the site of the entryway into Pulotu.

Spirits enter Pulotu at &quot;Le Fafa&quot; at Falealupo village.

<doc id="95925" wikidata="Q938304" url="?curid=95925" title="Maxima (software)">
<text>Maxima () is a powerful software package for performing computer algebra calculations in mathematics and the physical sciences. It is written in Common Lisp and runs on all POSIX platforms such as macOS, Unix, BSD, and Linux, as well as under Microsoft Windows and Android. It is free software released under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).

==History==
Maxima is based on a 1982 version of Macsyma, which was developed at MIT with funding from the United States Department of Energy and other government agencies. A version of Macsyma was maintained by Bill Schelter from 1982 until his death in 2001. In 1998, Schelter obtained permission from the Department of Energy to release his version under the GPL. That version, now called Maxima, is maintained by an independent group of users and developers. Maxima does not include any of the many modifications and enhancements made to the commercial version of Macsyma during 1982–1999. Though the core functionality remains similar, code depending on these enhancements may not work on Maxima, and bugs which were fixed in Macsyma may still be present in Maxima, and vice versa. Maxima participated in Google Summer of Code in 2019 under International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility.

==Symbolic calculations==

Like most computer algebra systems, Maxima supports a variety of ways of reorganizing symbolic algebraic expressions, such as polynomial factorization, polynomial greatest common divisor calculation, expansion, separation into real and imaginary parts, and transformation of trigonometric functions to exponential and vice versa. It has a variety of techniques for simplifying algebraic expressions involving trigonometric functions, roots, and exponential functions. It can calculate symbolic antiderivatives (&quot;indefinite integrals&quot;), definite integrals, and limits. It can derive closed-form series expansions as well as terms of Taylor-Maclaurin-Laurent series. It can perform matrix manipulations with symbolic entries.

Maxima is a general-purpose system, and special-case calculations such as factorization of large numbers, manipulation of extremely large polynomials, etc. are sometimes better done in specialized systems.

===Numeric calculations===
Maxima specializes in symbolic operations, but it also offers numerical capabilities such as arbitrary-precision integer, rational number, and floating-point numbers, limited only by space and time constraints.

===Programming===
Maxima includes a complete programming language with ALGOL-like syntax but Lisp-like semantics. It is written in Common Lisp and can be accessed programmatically and extended, as the underlying Lisp can be called from Maxima. It uses gnuplot for drawing.

For calculations using floating point and arrays heavily, Maxima has translators from the Maxima language to other programming languages (notably Fortran), which may execute more efficiently.

==Interfaces==
Various graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are available for Maxima:
* wxMaxima is high-quality graphical front-end using the wxWidgets framework. wxMaxima provides a cell structure similar to the Mathematica notebook as shown in the figure to the right.
* There is a kernel for Project Jupyter, a flexible, notebook-style GUI written in Python.
* GMaxima is a Maxima interface using GTK+.
* Cantor, using Qt, can interface with Maxima (along with SageMath, R, and KAlgebra)
* The GNU TeXmacs and LyX mathematical editor programs can be used to provide an interactive GUI for Maxima, as can SageMath. Other options include the Imaxima front end, as well as an Emacs and XEmacs interaction mode which is activated by Imaxima.
* Kayali
* Climaxima, a CLIM-based front-end.

<doc id="95927" wikidata="Q6492609" url="?curid=95927" title="Las Vegas Outlaws (XFL)">
<text>The Las Vegas Outlaws were an American football team in the XFL. They played in the Western Division with the Los Angeles Xtreme, San Francisco Demons and Memphis Maniax. They played their home games at Sam Boyd Stadium. On February 3, 2001, The Outlaws hosted the first nationally televised XFL game on NBC against the New York/New Jersey Hitmen.

==History==

Before the 2001 season began there was already question if Las Vegas could support a professional sports team due to past failed attempts with: Las Vegas Americans (Soccer-MISL- 1984-85), Las Vegas Dustdevils (Soccer-CISL-1994-1995), Las Vegas Posse (Football-CFL-1994) Las Vegas Quicksilvers (Soccer-NASL-1976-1978), Las Vegas Seagulls (Soccer-ASL-1979), Las Vegas Sting (Football-Arena Football League-1994-1995) and Las Vegas Thunder (IHL-1993-1999) The Outlaws were sponsored by Cox Communications, New York-New York Hotel &amp; Casino, Station Casinos, PacifiCare Health Systems and Findlay Toyota. Just like the Posse (and the later Locomotives), the Outlaws had a difficult time selling tickets. For the home opener against the Hitmen 13,700 tickets were sold for a stadium that seats 36,000. There were only 7,000 estimated season ticket holders. Compared to the rest of the league, the Outlaws&#x27; attendance was about average, at 22,000 fans per game. They were one of two teams (the league-leading San Francisco Demons being the other) to consistently play in a stadium that was more than half full. The league-leading defense, led by Defensive Coordinator Mark Criner, was nicknamed &quot;The Dealers of Doom.&quot;

==Players==
Among the team&#x27;s players were the XFL&#x27;s most well-known, Rod Smart (later with the National Football League&#x27;s Philadelphia Eagles, Carolina Panthers, and the Oakland Raiders), who went by the nickname of &quot;He Hate Me&quot;, which appeared on the back of his jersey. (He was originally going to put &quot;They Hate Me&quot;, but there wasn&#x27;t enough room.) Coached by former Boise State and Scottish Claymores head coach Jim Criner, the Outlaws competed in the XFL&#x27;s only season, held in the spring of 2001. The team encouraged their fans to come up with a nickname. They selected the &quot;Dealers of Doom Defense&quot;. After a strong start, the Outlaws suffered repeated injuries to their quarterbacks (by the midpoint of the season they were on their fourth-string quarterback) and lost their last three games to finish in last place in the division with a record of 4-6-0, just one game out of a playoff spot.

Despite having a two-year contract, NBC announced shortly after the season that it was getting out, as the season&#x27;s later games had garnered the lowest ratings for a major American television network since the Nielsen ratings had begun tracking them, and the league folded shortly afterwards.

The team was the centerpiece of the 2003 book about the XFL, &quot;Long Bomb: How the XFL Became TV&#x27;s Biggest Fiasco&quot;. It was written by Brett Forrest of &quot;Details&quot; magazine.

===Notable Las Vegas Outlaws players===
*87 Werner (Verne) Hippler, a German-born tight end who played 11 years in the NFL Europe League and has also been on the practice squads of the San Diego Chargers and Detroit Lions.
*10 Mike Cawley (James Madison) - The quarterback played in the NFL for five seasons with four teams, a season in the CFL with two teams, a season in NFLE with the Amsterdam Admirals, and one year with the Af2 Quad City Steamwheelers.
*81 Todd Floyd (UNLV) - The wide receiver played for the Frankfurt Galaxy of NFLE and was on the preseason rosters of the Jacksonville Jaguars and Buffalo Bills.
*22 Chrys Chukwuma(Arkansas) -The running back was briefly on the Dallas Cowboys&#x27; roster.
*30 Rod Smart (Western Kentucky) - &quot;He Hate Me&quot; would go on to become the first former XFL player to appear in a Super Bowl: Super Bowl XXXVIII for the Panthers.
*82 Mike Furrey (Ohio State/Northern Iowa) - Like Smart, the receiver has enjoyed a long NFL career.
*17 Paul McCallum - Kicker who played for NFLE&#x27;s Scottish Claymores. Most recently played in 2016 as a member of the BC Lions franchise, in the Canadian Football League; McCallum was the last active former XFL player in any professional league.
*92 Kelvin T.G. Kinney (Virginia State) - The defensive end has spent time with the Detroit Lions and Washington Redskins.
*31 Kelly Herndon (Toledo) - The cornerback later landed with the Seattle Seahawks. In Super Bowl XL, he returned an interception for a then record of 76 yards. Since then it has been broken by Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker James Harrison.
*16 Mark Grieb - The quarterback would go on to win two ArenaBowls with the San Jose SaberCats. In the XFL, Grieb only got his chance when the starting quarterback Ryan Clement was injured.

<doc id="95928" wikidata="Q227308" url="?curid=95928" title="Z shell">
<text>The Z shell (Zsh) is a Unix shell that can be used as an interactive login shell and as a command interpreter for shell scripting. Zsh is an extended Bourne shell with many improvements, including some features of Bash, ksh, and tcsh.

Zsh was created by Paul Falstad in 1990 while he was a student at Princeton University. It combines features from both ksh and tcsh, offering functionality such as programmable command-line completion, extended file globbing, improved variable/array handling, and themeable prompts.

Zsh is available for Microsoft Windows as part of the UnxUtils collection and has been adopted as the default shell for macOS and Kali Linux. The &quot;Oh My Zsh&quot; user community website provides a platform for third-party plug-ins and themes, featuring a large and active contributor base.

== History ==
Paul Falstad wrote the first version of Zsh in 1990 while a student at Princeton University. The name &quot;zsh&quot; derives from the name of Yale professor Zhong Shao (then a teaching assistant at Princeton University) – Paul Falstad regarded Shao&#x27;s login-id, &quot;zsh&quot;, as a good name for a shell.

Zsh was at first intended to be a subset of csh for the Amiga, but expanded far beyond that. By the time of the release of version 1.0 in 1990 the aim was to be a cross between ksh and tcsh – a powerful &quot;command and programming language&quot; that is well-designed and logical (like ksh), but also built for humans (like tcsh), with all the neat features like spell checking, login/logout watching and termcap support that were &quot;probably too weird to make it into an AT&amp;T product&quot;.

Zsh is available for Microsoft Windows as part of the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities.

In 2019, macOS Catalina adopted Zsh as the default login shell, replacing the GPLv2 licensed version of Bash, and when Bash is run interactively on Catalina, a warning is shown by default.

In 2020, Kali Linux adopted Zsh as the default shell since its 2020.4 release.

== Features ==

Features include:

* Programmable command-line completion that can help the user type both options and arguments for most used commands, with out-of-the-box support for several hundred commands
* Sharing of command history among all running shells
* Extended file globbing allows file specification without needing to run an external program such as find
* Improved variable/array handling (non-zero-based numbering)
* Editing of multi-line commands in a single buffer
* Spelling correction and autofill of command names (and optionally arguments, assumed to be file names)
* Various compatibility modes, e.g. Zsh can pretend to be a Bourne shell when run as codice_1
* Themeable prompts, including the ability to put prompt information on the right side of the screen and have it auto-hide when typing a long command
* Loadable modules, providing among other things: full TCP and Unix domain socket controls, an FTP client, and extended math functions.
* The built-in codice_2 command. Works like the codice_3 command but shows all locations of the target command in the directories specified in codice_4 rather than only the one that will be used.
* Named directories. This allows the user to set up shortcuts such as codice_5, which then behave the way codice_6 and codice_7 do.
* Widgets. Both built and implemented by ordinary functions widgets can be bound to hotkeys.
* Function autoloading. A performance optimization for function that might be pre-loaded and run on demand. The intent of loading functions as separate file is also to support function features across different zsh versions.

== Community ==
A user community website known as &quot;Oh My Zsh&quot; collects third-party plug-ins and themes for the Z shell. As of 2024, their GitHub repository has over 2300 contributors, over 300 plug-ins, and over 140 themes. It also comes with an auto-update tool that makes it easier to keep installed plug-ins and themes updated.

<doc id="95931" wikidata="Q6938721" url="?curid=95931" title="Murimuria">
<text>In pre-Christian Fijian mythology, Murimuria is part of the underworld. According to Fijian religion, after a man dies, his soul is brought over a stretch of water by a ferryman, and has to face many dangers on the other side by going through the Path of the Souls (Sala Ni Yalo). For unmarried men, there seems to be no chance of surviving this path, because even if they escape the Great Woman, they would be killed by the monster Nangganangga, since no one ever got away from it, while married men could survive, if they withstand the Pandanus tree and the armed giant Killer of Souls. The survivors are judged by the god called Degei. Those who had the favor of Degei (chiefs with great wealth and many wives, who were destroyers of many towns, killers of many enemies and rulers over a powerful people) are instructed not to try to cross the lake. These go to Burotu. The rest inevitably try cross the lake by a boat that always capsizes. They eventually sink to the bottom, Murimuria, and are rewarded and punished appropriately.

Murimuria is considered a place neither of happiness, nor of unhappiness. As such, residence in Murimuria is characterized by both punishment and peace. Some of the souls in Murimuria are punished for sins committed while alive. However, these sins do not necessarily correspond to Christian notions of sin. Those who did not kill an enemy in life are forced to pound muck with clubs, which is regarded as the most degrading punishment. Those who did not have their ears pierced are forced to carry upon their shoulders for ever logs of wood upon which tapa cloth is beaten out, jeered by all who see them. Women who were not tattooed are chased by ghosts who use sharp shells to tear at their skin or turn them into bread. Anyone who has done an act which displeases the gods are laid in rows on their faces and turned into taro beds.

==Politics==
Between 1864 and 1928, Wapello County backed the Republican candidate in every election except 1912, when former Republican Theodore Roosevelt ran as the Progressive candidate, fracturing the Republican party and allowing Democrat Woodrow Wilson to take the county with a plurality of the vote of less than 37%. From 1932 to 2012, the county voted Democratic in every election except two, the nationwide Republican landslides of Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and Richard Nixon in 1972. Beginning in 2016, Wapello County has shifted back to the Republican column, as Donald Trump carried the county in each of his three runs, winning by a margin of over 20% in 2016 and over 23% in 2020, and over 31% in 2024. Also in 2024, Trump became the first candidate from any party to obtain at least 65% of the county&#x27;s vote since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, and the first Republican to do so since Herbert Hoover in 1928.

<text>Van Buren County ( ) is a county located in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census the population was 7,203, making it the state&#x27;s tenth-least populous county. The county seat is Keosauqua, which contains the oldest continuously operational courthouse in the state of Iowa, and second-oldest in the United States.

==History==

Van Buren County was formed on December 7, 1836, as a part of Wisconsin Territory, and was split off from Des Moines County. It was named for President Martin Van Buren. It became a part of Iowa Territory (later the state of Iowa) when that territory was organized on July 4, 1838.

The county&#x27;s courthouse was built in September 1843 in the style of Greek Revival and stands as Iowa&#x27;s oldest, and the nation&#x27;s second-oldest, courthouse in operation.
&quot;The Honey War&quot; refers to a colorful episode in Van Buren County&#x27;s history when the State of Missouri and Wisconsin Territory border came into dispute. Missouri attempted to collect taxes from residents north of the disputed Sullivan Line of 1816, which residents said was not rightfully theirs to tax. The sheriff of Van Buren County subsequently arrested and jailed the sheriff from Kahoka, Missouri, and Missourians were charged with &quot;stealing honey from bee trees&quot; in what is now Lacey-Keosauqua State Park. Each governor sent troops to resolve the problem but no bloodshed resulted. The matter was turned over to the U.S. Congress for arbitration. The dispute, however, was not resolved until 1846, when Iowa became a state. Congress ruled &quot;in favor of Iowa, allowing the original Sullivan line of 1816 to remain intact&quot;.

Van Buren County is also home to Iowa&#x27;s oldest community theater group still in operation, the &quot;Van Buren Players,&quot; founded in 1963.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.2%) is water.

† &quot;county seat&quot;

==Politics==
Van Buren County has been predominantly Republican throughout its history, voting for the Democratic candidate only six times in presidential elections from 1896 onward. However, the county was a national bellwether between 1964 &amp; 2004, but voted Republican by wide margins in years the nation went Republican. Aside from Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s landslide victory in 1964, the margins of victory Democrats won the county by in this 40-year period were incredibly narrow, with the difference being less than one hundred votes when Jimmy Carter (being a mere 3 vote margin) &amp; Bill Clinton won the county. From 2000 on, the county has trended strongly Republican, particularly in 2016 where Hillary Clinton received the lowest percentage by a Democratic candidate in 60 years. Clinton also failed to win even 1,000 votes, a feat which every major party candidate prior to 2016 had been able to accomplish in the county.

<text>Union County is a county located in the southern part of the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 12,138. The county seat is Creston. Organized at a time of tensions before the Civil War, the county was named in 1853 for the union that people wanted to preserve. Union County peaked in population at the 1900 Census. Its economy is based on agriculture and related industries.

==History==
The first permanent European-American settlers came in 1849 and 1850. Mormons had earlier established Mt. Pisgah in the eastern part of the county as a way station as they traveled west, but had left this area by 1848. Settlers used Pisgah as a base to establish farms along the Grand and Platte rivers that run through the county. They found a market for their produce with the emigrants traveling overland to California to take part in the Gold Rush. Travelers often sought shelter with the settlers along the way. In 1851 one settler counted 2,600 teams driven by emigrants to California; they often drove herds of sheep and cattle, trying to get animals to the gold fields to feed the miners, but many died along the way.

The first village was Petersville, founded in 1853, the same year that the county was organized. The county was named for the union which many people wanted to preserve, at a time of rising tensions between the North and the South.

After the American Civil War, railroad construction linked the areas of the county, giving rise to new towns, and gave access to other markets. In 1868 the railroad reached Afton, Iowa, and the next year Creston, the county seat, was made a division point. The railroad built service facilities there, a roundhouse and related structures. The railroad brought immigrants and migrants to the area, who were attracted to the fertile soil as farmland. Immigrants came from across central and eastern Europe, as well as from eastern states of the US. The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad (BNSF) continues to be important in the area, serving as the chief network for hauling grain and coal. Over the years, it drew workers from industrial cities such as Chicago to Creston.

The county has a fair each year. In the late 19th century, southwestern Iowa claimed the title of Bluegrass Capital, having cultivated bluegrass throughout the area. In 1889 the Bluegrass Association was founded, made up of representatives of the 18 counties in this region. They built a Bluegrass Palace on the Union County Fairgrounds. It was designed by Louis Syberkro, an artist, and constructed by J. C. Woodruff, both of Creston. Made of sod and baled hay on a wood frame, the building was 100 feet square, with corner turrets and a central tower 92 feet high. It held exhibits of farm products and resource commodities from counties of the association, including wood, coal, sandstone, and marble. The palace was such a success that the Bluegrass Association commissioned a larger one the following year, which supplied about three times as much space. In a separate wing was an auditorium large enough to hold 2,000 people.

For the next seven election cycles, from 1988 to 2012, Tama County backed the Democratic candidate in each election, although George W. Bush came extremely close to winning the county in both 2000 and 2004, losing by slim margins of just 11 and 31 votes respectively. In 2016, Donald Trump moved the county back into the Republican camp, taking nearly 57% of the county&#x27;s vote and winning it by more than 20%, the best margin in the county for any candidate since Ronald Reagan won the county during his 1980 landslide. Though Trump&#x27;s margin of victory dropped slightly to just over 19% in 2020, he increased his vote share to almost 59%, the best vote share for a candidate of either party in Tama County since the 1964 landslide victory of Lyndon B. Johnson.

<text>Story County is a county in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census, the population was 98,537, making it the ninth-most populous county in Iowa. The county seat is Nevada; the largest city is Ames. The geographical center of Iowa lies in Story County, northeast of Ames. Story County comprises the Ames, IA Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Des Moines-Ames-West Des Moines, IA Combined Statistical Area. The county is home to Iowa State University in Ames.

==History==
The land that today is known as Story County was originally prairie with the exception of some groves along the larger streams in the area. In 1846 the boundaries of Story County were established. The county has an area of and is square in shape.

The county was named after Joseph Story, a preeminent United States Supreme Court Justice, in 1853. The first settlers to the area came from Indiana, then from the New England states of New York and Pennsylvania. Later, many Norwegians, Germans and Danes came directly from overseas and inhabited the area. The first large population influx occurred during the 1850s. Story County was not mentioned in the Federal Census in 1850, but figures from the State of Iowa put the population at 214 in 1852. By 1860 the population had increased to 4,501.

Three commissioners were appointed by the Iowa legislature to determine the county seat location. On June 27, 1853, they announced Nevada as their choice. Nevada (pronounced &quot;Nuh-VAY-Dah&quot;) was named after the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. Like many Midwestern towns, cities and counties, many prominent locations from the newly explored West and Mexican–American War of the late 1840s inspired the naming of towns and counties in Iowa during this period.

Railroad construction did more to develop Story County than any other single factor. The first railroad came to the county in 1863 with the first station being built in Colo. Railroads were such a decisive factor in determining the location of towns that several communities in Story County moved to be closer to the rail line. Some flourishing little towns that were bypassed by the railroad soon disappeared. Although Nevada was long the population center of the county, Ames was the most widely known of the towns because of the busy railroad depot where travelers would transfer to their next train.

Story County has had five courthouses. The first, a two-level frame building, was erected in 1856. Fire destroyed it in 1863, and it was replaced by a similar structure, which was replaced by a larger three-level building in 1877, situated on the town square. This building&#x27;s tower served as a vantage point to view the countryside; it was eventually removed for safety reasons. The fourth courthouse was built in 1967 and placed in service on May 18, 1968. That building is still in use as offices for the Board of Supervisors, Auditor, Treasurer, Recorder, Assessor, Information Technology, Facilities Management, Health and Planning &amp; Development Offices. A cannon from the Civil War rests on the lawn. The current courthouse, the Story County Justice Center, opened in 2002. The Justice Center, comprising the law enforcement and judicial aspects of Story County Government. The Justice Center houses the Sheriff&#x27;s Office &amp; Jail, Attorney, and Clerk of Court.

Of red sandstone, it was completed in 1904, and still serves as the courthouse.

Northwest Iowa Community College is also in Sioux County, though it is most often associated with the community of Sheldon in O&#x27;Brien County.

==Politics==
Due to its religious Dutch Reformed character, Sioux County is overwhelmingly Republican in Presidential elections. The only Democratic presidential nominee to ever carry Sioux County since the Civil War has been Franklin D. Roosevelt, who did so in 1932 and 1936; however, Theodore Roosevelt won the county as a Progressive in 1912 and George B. McClellan carried the county in the wartime 1864 election. The Democrats have only garnered 40 percent of the county&#x27;s vote once since Roosevelt. Further underlining the county&#x27;s heavy Republican bent, in 1964 it was one of only seven counties in the state to support Barry Goldwater, who easily carried the county with almost 66 percent of the vote–a near-reversal of Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s statewide margin. In addition, in 2008, when Barack Obama carried Iowa by 9.5 points, Sioux County was his weakest of all 99 counties in the state, with John McCain winning the county by 62 points. By 2020, the county at 66.5 point margin was Joe Biden&#x27;s second-weakest county in Iowa, being overtaken by almost as equally Republican neighboring Lyon County at 67.5 points.

In 1992, Sioux County was one of only two counties in the nation, along with Jackson County, Kentucky, to give George H. W. Bush over seventy percent of its vote. In the six elections since then, the Republican candidates has never received less than 75 percent of the county&#x27;s vote. It is located in what was, until 2013, Iowa&#x27;s 5th congressional district which had a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+9 and was represented by Republican Steve King. King won the seat in Iowa&#x27;s new 4th congressional district in the 2012 election with 53% of the district&#x27;s vote, and with 83% of Sioux County votes going for King.

<doc id="95947" wikidata="Q306031" url="?curid=95947" title="Tcsh">
<text>tcsh ( “tee-see-shell”, “tee-shell”, or as “tee see ess aitch”, codice_1) is a Unix shell based on and backward compatible with the C shell (codice_2).

==Shell==
It is essentially the C shell with programmable command-line completion, command-line editing, and a few other features. Unlike the other common shells, functions cannot be defined in a tcsh script and the user must use aliases instead (as in csh). It is the native root shell for some BSD-based systems, including FreeBSD 13 and earlier. (FreeBSD 14 changed the default root shell to codice_3 to match the default user shell whereas OpenBSD uses the Korn shell codice_4 for both root and regular users.)

tcsh added filename and command completion and command line editing concepts borrowed from the TENEX operating system, which is the source of the “t”. Because it only added functionality and did not change what was there, tcsh remained backward compatible with the original C shell. Though it started as a side branch from the original csh source tree that Bill Joy had created, tcsh is now the main branch for ongoing development.

tcsh is very stable but new releases continue to appear roughly once a year, consisting mostly of minor bug fixes.

On many systems, such as macOS and Red Hat Linux, codice_2 is actually codice_1. Often one of the two files is either a hard link or a symbolic link to the other, so that either name refers to the same improved version of the C shell (although behavior may be altered depending on which name is used).

On Debian and some derivatives (including Ubuntu), there are two different packages: csh and tcsh. The former is based on the original BSD version of csh and the latter is the improved tcsh.

==History==
The “t” in codice_1 comes from the “T” in TENEX, an operating system which inspired Ken Greer at Carnegie Mellon University, the author of tcsh, with its command-completion feature. Greer began working on his code to implement Tenex-style file name completion in September 1975, finally merging it into the C shell in December 1981. Mike Ellis at Fairchild A.I. Labs added command completion in September 1983. On October 3, 1983, Greer posted source to the net.sources newsgroup.

==Significant features==
*Command history
**The built-in codice_8 command displays the previously entered commands
**Use of / at the command line to allow the user to select a command from the history to edit/execute
**Invoking previous commands using command history
***codice_9 executes the previous command
***codice_10 executes the nth command that was previously executed
***codice_11 executes the command that was executed &quot;n&quot; commands ago
***codice_12 executes the most recently executed command that starts with &quot;string&quot;
***codice_13 executes the most recently executed command that contains &quot;string&quot;
**Using history in new commands
***codice_14 - refers to all of the arguments from the previous command
***codice_15 - refers to the last argument from the previous command
***codice_16 - refers to the first argument from the previous command
***codice_17 - refers to the nth argument from the previous command
***codice_18 - refers to the mth through nth arguments from the previous command
***codice_19 - refers to the nth through the last argument from the previous command
*Command line editing
*Auto-completion of file names and variables as well as programmable completion at the command line
*Alias argument selectors; the ability to define an alias to take arguments supplied to it and apply them to the commands that it refers to. Tcsh is the only shell that provides this feature (in lieu of functions).
**codice_20 - argument selector for all arguments, including the alias/command itself; arguments need not be supplied.
**codice_21 - argument selector for all arguments, excluding the alias/command; arguments need not be supplied.
**codice_22 - argument selector for the last argument; argument need not be supplied, but if none is supplied, the alias name is considered to be the last argument.
**codice_23 - argument selector for first argument; argument MUST be supplied.
**codice_24 - argument selector for the nth argument; argument MUST be supplied; n=0 refers to the alias/command name.
**codice_25 - argument selector for the arguments from the mth to the nth; arguments MUST be supplied.
**codice_26 - argument selector for the arguments from the nth to the last; at least argument n MUST be supplied.
**codice_27 - argument selector for the arguments from the nth to the last; sufficient arguments need not be supplied.
#Alias the cd command so that when you change directories, the contents are immediately displayed.
alias cd &#x27;cd \!* &amp;&amp; ls&#x27;

*Wildcard matching
if ( &quot;$input&quot; =~ [0-9]* ) then
 echo &quot;the input starts with an integer&quot;
else
 echo &quot;the input does NOT start with an integer&quot;
endif

*Job control
*The built-in codice_28 command. Works like the codice_29 command but shows all locations of the target command in the directories specified in codice_30 rather than only the one that will be used.

==Deployment==
Early versions of Mac OS X shipped with tcsh as the default shell, but the default for new accounts became bash as of 10.3, then zsh as of 10.15. (tcsh is still provided, and upgrading the OS does not change the shell of any existing accounts). tcsh was the default root shell of FreeBSD prior to 14.0 (the current shell and default user shell in older versions, is POSIX-based) and its descendants like DragonFly BSD and DesktopBSD.

<doc id="95953" wikidata="Q1044523" url="?curid=95953" title="Office Space">
<text>Office Space is a 1999 American satirical black comedy film written and directed by Mike Judge. It satirizes the office work life of a typical 1990s software company, focusing on a handful of individuals weary of their jobs. It stars Ron Livingston, Jennifer Aniston, Gary Cole, Stephen Root, David Herman, Ajay Naidu, and Diedrich Bader.

&quot;Office Space&quot; was filmed in Dallas and Austin, Texas. It is based on Judge&#x27;s &quot;Milton&quot; cartoon series and was his first foray into live-action filmmaking. The film was Judge&#x27;s second full-length motion picture release, following &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America&quot;. It was released in theaters on February 19, 1999 by 20th Century Fox. Its sympathetic depiction of ordinary information technology workers garnered a cult following within that field, but it also addresses themes familiar to white-collar employees and the workforce in general. It was a box office disappointment, making $12.2 million on a $10 million production budget; however, it sold well on home video, and has become a cult film.

Several aspects of the film have become Internet memes. A scene in which the three main characters systematically destroy a dysfunctional printer has been widely parodied. Swingline introduced a red stapler to its product line after the Milton character used one painted in that color in the film. Judge&#x27;s 2009 film &quot;Extract&quot; is also set in an office and was intended as a companion piece to &quot;Office Space&quot;.

==Plot==

Peter Gibbons is a frustrated and unmotivated programmer who works at Texas-based software company Initech. Unable to stand up to his overcritical girlfriend, Anne, he is in love with local waitress Joanna, but is afraid to speak to her. He is friends with co-workers Samir Nagheenanajar, who hates that no one can pronounce his last name, and Michael Bolton, who hates having the same name as the famous singer. Other co-workers include Milton Waddams, a meek who mumbles to himself and is mostly ignored by the rest of the office; and Tom Smykowski, a jaded product manager who is routinely scared of being fired. The staff suffers under top-heavy, callous management, especially from vice president Bill Lumbergh, a tedious micromanager who regularly humiliates Milton and makes Peter work almost every weekend. Peter hates Lumbergh but avoids confronting him.

Anne persuades Peter to attend an occupational hypnotherapy session led by Dr. Swanson. Swanson hypnotizes Peter and tells him to feel relaxed and stop caring about his job until he snaps his fingers. However, Swanson suddenly dies of a heart attack before snapping Peter out of it. Peter sleeps soundly through the next day, ignoring phone calls from Lumbergh and Anne, who angrily breaks up with him while confirming his suspicions that she has been cheating on him.

Two business consultants are brought in to help the company downsize, and Peter begins dating Joanna. She works at a chain restaurant where she is required to wear &quot;pieces of flair&quot;: buttons allowing employees to &quot;express themselves&quot;. Her boss hassles her for not wearing more than the required minimum.

Peter eventually shows up to work and casually disregards office protocol, stealing Lumbergh&#x27;s parking space, violating the dress code, and removing a cubicle wall that blocks his view out the window. Impressed by Peter&#x27;s frank insights into Initech&#x27;s problems, the consultants promote him despite Lumbergh&#x27;s misgivings; however, they lay off Michael and Samir. While attempting to do the same to Milton, they learn that he had already been laid off five years prior but had not been notified due to a payroll glitch. They fix the glitch and stop Milton&#x27;s salary payments without telling him, while Lumbergh continues to mistreat him by confiscating his beloved red stapler and repeatedly relocating his desk, eventually down to the basement.

Tired of their own mistreatment, Peter, Michael, and Samir decide to take revenge by infecting Initech&#x27;s accounting system with a computer virus designed by Michael to divert huge numbers of fractions of pennies into a bank account. Peter successfully installs the virus, and on Michael and Samir&#x27;s last day, he steals a frequently malfunctioning printer, which the three proceed to destroy in a field. At a weekend party, Peter hears rumors from a colleague that Joanna had slept with Lumbergh. When Joanna confirms this, a heated exchange leads to them breaking up. Frustrated with her job, Joanna quits in response to another lecture about her lack of &quot;flair&quot;.

On Monday, Peter discovers that a bug in Michael&#x27;s code has caused the virus to steal over $300,000 across the weekend, which guarantees they will be caught and sent to federal prison. Unable to conceal the crime, Peter decides to accept full responsibility, writing a confession and slipping it under Lumbergh&#x27;s office door after hours, along with traveler&#x27;s checks for the stolen money. Peter learns that the &#x27;Lumbergh&#x27; with whom Joanna slept was Ron Lumbergh, another software engineer unrelated to Bill Lumbergh. He meets Joanna, who has started a new job at another restaurant to apologize and they reconcile.

The next morning, Peter drives to Initech to turn himself in but arrives to find the building on fire, as Milton has committed arson to take revenge on the company. With the evidence of his crime destroyed, Peter begins working in construction with his neighbor Lawrence, while Samir and Michael join Initech&#x27;s rival, Initrode. Having found the traveler&#x27;s checks, Milton escapes to Mexico but continues to be denied respect.

==Production==

===Development===
&quot;Office Space&quot; originated in the series of three animated &quot;Milton&quot; short films that Judge created about an office worker by that name. They first aired on &quot;Liquid Television&quot; and on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The inspiration came from a temp job which he had that involved alphabetizing purchase orders and another job as an engineer for Parallax Graphics for three months in the San Francisco Bay Area during the 1980s, &quot;just in the heart of Silicon Valley and in the middle of that overachiever yuppie thing, it was just awful.&quot;

Peter Chernin, head of 20th Century Fox, where Judge had a deal, wanted to make a film out of the Milton character, inspired by a former coworker of Judge&#x27;s in Silicon Valley who had threatened to quit if the company moved his desk again. &quot;You don&#x27;t want to know what he does at home after work&quot;, Judge replied. Instead he suggested an ensemble cast–based film; someone at the studio responded with &quot;Car Wash&quot; but &quot;just set in an office.&quot;

Milton was not the only character inspired by someone from Judge&#x27;s past. During his jobs in Silicon Valley, where he barely made enough to afford his rent, he had a neighbor who was an auto mechanic. Not only did the man make more money, he had flexible work hours and seemed to Judge to be much more content with his life and work than he himself was. The neighbor inspired Lawrence, Peter&#x27;s neighbor in the film.

The setting of the film reflects a prevailing trend that Judge observed in the United States. &quot;It seems like every city now has these identical office parks with identical adjoining chain restaurants&quot;, he said in an interview. &quot;There were a lot of people who wanted me to set this movie in Wall Street, or like the movie &quot;Brazil&quot;, but I wanted it very unglamorous, the kind of bleak work situation like I was in&quot;.

Judge wrote a treatment in 1996, and the script after the first season of &quot;King of the Hill&quot;. Fox president Tom Rothman was happy with the draft as he was looking for lighter material to balance the event movies like &quot;Titanic&quot; that dominated the studio&#x27;s output at the time. He considered it &quot;the most brilliant workplace satire I&#x27;d ever read&quot;. Despite that, Judge hated the ending and wished he could have completely rewritten the third act.

===Casting===

David Herman was the only actor Judge had in mind for a specific part: Michael Bolton. Herman had been trying to leave his seven-year contract at &quot;MADtv&quot;, but the show would not let him. So, at its next table reading, he managed to get himself fired by screaming all his lines. Greg Daniels said they could always find a place for him on &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, where he had been doing some voice work; soon after he read Judge&#x27;s &quot;Office Space&quot; script and was delighted with it.

At the first read-through of the script, Judge was pleased with Herman&#x27;s performance, and felt Stephen Root improved on his own take on Milton, but was not happy with the rest of the cast. He considered abandoning the film, but Rothman said it worked and just needed the right actors. According to Judge, while Fox at first told him to just get the best actors possible since the film&#x27;s budget would not be large enough to consider bankable stars, the studio soon changed its mind.

In the wake of the success of &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, he was advised to get that film&#x27;s stars, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Again, he almost changed his mind about the film (Rothman said in 2019 that while A-list stars are often unlikely to take roles in low-budget productions, those films should nevertheless make the effort to attract them). He had agreed to meet with Damon in New York, but then Ron Livingston&#x27;s agent asked if his client could audition for the lead. Casting director Nancy Klopper was impressed, and after Judge saw the video he told the studio that he wanted Livingston in the part.

Jennifer Aniston was cast to accommodate Fox&#x27;s desire to have a recognizable star in the film, although they were concerned that her part was so small; the subplot involving her battle with her boss over her &quot;flair&quot; was added as a result and she was written out of the sex-dream sequence, along with dialogue indicating she actually had slept with Lumbergh. However, she had liked the script since she was not getting many other films like that at that point, and she had gone to the same high school as Herman, Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School in New York. Kate Hudson also read for the part.

After casting the Indian American Ajay Naidu as Samir, who had originally been written as Iranian, the character was rewritten to be Jordanian, and Naidu worked with a dialect coach to get the accent right. John C. McGinley auditioned for Lumbergh, but was ultimately cast as Slydell. Judge says that after Gary Cole read for Lumbergh, there was no doubt as to who would play him. &quot;He made the character 10 times funnier.&quot; A casting search in Texas yielded Greg Pitts for Drew, but no one who could play the Chotchkie&#x27;s manager, so Judge took that role himself.

===Principal photography===

Judge made the transition from animation to live-action with the help of Tim Suhrstedt, the film&#x27;s director of photography, who taught him about lenses and where to put the camera. Judge says, &quot;I had a great crew, and it&#x27;s good going into it not pretending you&#x27;re an expert&quot;. Principal photography began in Texas in May 1998.

Several issues arose during filming. By the third day of shooting, temperatures had risen over 100 °F (38 °C), and smoke from fires in Mexico was filling the sky over Austin, making it white. Suhrstedt says that forced the postponement of the opening traffic-jam scene until it cleared.

Studio executives who saw the dailies were not happy with the footage that Judge was getting. Judge quoted studio executives as stating, &quot;More energy! More energy! We gotta reshoot it! You&#x27;re failing! You&#x27;re failing!&quot; They also asked for Livingston to smile more. But at that point, only the early scenes had been filmed; Judge told the studio that happier scenes would come later. Livingston says he heard they believed he was on drugs and were considering firing him.

In addition, Fox did not like the gangsta rap music used in the film. Rothman told him he had to take it out, and Judge said after production he would do so if the next focus group also disliked it. A young man in that focus group said the fact that the characters worked in an office but listened to gangsta rap was one of the things he liked about the movie, and Rothman relented.

The scene where Peter, Michael and Samir take their office printer out into a field and batter it to pieces was inspired by Judge&#x27;s experience with his own printer while writing &quot;Beavis and Butt-head Do America&quot;. He told his cowriter Joe Stillman that he was so frustrated by it that when he was done with the script he planned to take it out into a field and destroy it while videotaping the process. Suhrstedt says the whole sequence was largely improvised, but Naidu adds that they were trying to do it in a way that evoked how the Mafia would do it to someone it wanted to punish or kill; Livingston thus played his part like the &quot;don&quot;, circling behind Naidu and Herman while they struck the blows with bat, feet and fists. Years afterward, Naidu says, he met some actual mafiosi in New York who told him that they were huge fans of the film, and the scene was &quot;authentic&quot;.

McGinley says the film contains many improvised moments. &quot;It was like jazz on that set&quot;. One example he recalled was when Paul Willson as Bob Porter cannot pronounce Samir&#x27;s last name: &quot;Naga ... Naga ... well, not gonna work here anymore anyway.&quot; Naidu, for his part, improvised the break dancing, which he did with local friends after shooting his scenes during the day.

The improvisation also helped solve some problems with the script. Originally Bolton was to refer to the singer he shared his name with as a &quot;no-singing asshole&quot;. However, Herman recalled, it was decided that the film could not say that since it would imply he did not sing his own songs, so he came up with &quot;no-talent ass-clown&quot;.

The Alligator Grill, on South Lamar Blvd, Austin, was used for the interior shots of Chotchkies, Joanna&#x27;s workplace.

===Production design===

Judge was very exacting in his demands for how the Initech set looked; he said regularly that it had to seem &quot;oppressive&quot;. The production went as far as screen-testing different types of gray cubicles; Judge also wanted the cubicles to be tall so that Lumbergh would have to lean in to be seen from Peter&#x27;s desk. Considerable effort was also expended to making sure the TPS reports looked realistic.

The glasses Root wore to play Milton had lenses so thick that he had to wear contact lenses to see through them. Even so, he still had no depth perception; he had to practice reaching for the stapler and was as a result grateful it had been painted red. Swingline provided the stapler after the filmmakers could not get permission to use either the Boston or Bostitch brands from their manufacturer.

==Release==

===Marketing===
Judge hated the onesheet poster that the studio created for &quot;Office Space&quot;, which depicted an office worker completely covered in Post-it notes. He said, &quot;People were like, &#x27;What is this? A big bird? A mummy? A beekeeper?&#x27; And the tagline &#x27;Work Sucks&#x27;? It looked like an Office Depot ad. I just hated it. I hated the trailers, too and the TV ads especially&quot;. McGinley, too, felt it looked like Big Bird from the children&#x27;s series &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and that he would not go to see such a film. For the home release Judge was upset that the same image was used, albeit with Milton peeking over the man from behind.

The studio also had a man live in a Plexiglas cube above Times Square for five days, who was broadcast live on the Internet as he answered calls and emails from people dissatisfied with their jobs. Livingston, when he visited the cube for press events, found that most reporters preferred to talk to the man in the cube and not him. He was not surprised, as tracking for the movie was not good and &quot;there was a foregone conclusion that it wasn&#x27;t going to open well.&quot; Producer Michael Rotenberg elaborated that &quot;[i]t took a few research screenings to realize that audiences often have issues with satire.&quot;

Another problem that Rothman later conceded was that they could not put Aniston on the poster due to her small role. Later he admitted that the marketing campaign did not work and said, &quot;&quot;Office Space&quot; isn&#x27;t like &quot;American Pie&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t have the kind of jokes you put in a 15-second television spot of somebody getting hit on the head with a frying pan. It&#x27;s sly. And let me tell you, sly is hard to sell&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;Office Space&quot; was released on February 19, 1999, at the end of the release calendar&#x27;s &quot;dump months&quot;, in 1,740 theaters, grossing $4.2 million on its opening weekend. That was eighth overall and second for new releases after &quot;October Sky&quot;. Herman said he was elated after seeing the film in Los Angeles and hearing it had made $7 million, until friends more familiar with the movie business told him that was considered a poor performance.

Suhrstedt saw it later in Burbank, and the theater was almost full. He assured Judge that word of mouth would slowly increase the audience. However, in early March, Fox pulled it from three-quarters of the screens it had been on after it barely made a million dollars that weekend. The movie&#x27;s grosses continued to decline precipitously, and after the end of March, when it pulled in less than $40,000 from 75 screens, it was pulled from release altogether. According to Judge, a studio executive blamed the movie exclusively for the failure, telling him &quot;Nobody wants to see your little movie about ordinary people and their boring little lives.&quot;

It went on to make $10.8 million in North America. The international release brought an additional $2 million. On home release, $8 million in DVD, Blu-ray Disc and VHS sales were sold at release as of April 2006.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 81% based on 103 reviews and an average rating of 6.80/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Mike Judge lampoons the office grind with its inspired mix of sharp dialogue and witty one-liners.&quot; Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on reviews from 31 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore during opening weekend gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on a scale ranging from A+ to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three out of four stars and wrote that Judge &quot;treats his characters a little like cartoon creatures. That works. Nuances of behavior are not necessary, because in the cubicle world every personality trait is magnified, and the captives stagger forth like grotesques.&quot; In his review for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Mick LaSalle writes, &quot;Livingston is nicely cast as Peter, a young guy whose imagination and capacity for happiness are the very things making him miserable.&quot; In &quot;USA Today&quot;, Susan Wloszczyna wrote, &quot;If you&#x27;ve ever had a job, you&#x27;ll be amused by this paean to peons.&quot;

Owen Gleiberman in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;C&quot; rating and criticized it for feeling &quot;cramped and underimagined&quot;. In his review for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Rick Groen wrote: &quot;Perhaps his TV background makes him unaccustomed to the demands of a feature-length script (the ending seems almost panicky in its abruptness), or maybe he just succumbs to the lure of the easy yuk...what began as discomfiting satire soon devolves into silly farce.&quot; In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden wrote, &quot;It has the loose-jointed feel of a bunch of sketches packed together into a narrative that doesn&#x27;t gather much momentum.&quot;

In 2008, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named &quot;Office Space&quot; one of &quot;The 100 best films from 1983 to 2008&quot;, ranking it at #73.

===Cult status===

Disappointed in the film&#x27;s $12 million domestic gross, Judge decided to move on and began work on what eventually became &quot;Extract&quot;, a similarly themed followup to &quot;Office Space&quot;. Fox suggested that next time, he pay more heed to the studio&#x27;s casting suggestions. However, he soon learned that the film had not gone unnoticed within the industry. &quot;Jim Carrey invited me to his house. Chris Rock left me the best voicemail ever. I had dinner with Madonna&quot;, who found the Michael Bolton character&#x27;s anger &quot;sexy&quot;, Judge said.

Four years later, Judge was working on the &quot;Idiocracy&quot; screenplay with Etan Cohen. During a break, the two went to an Austin Starbucks, and the baristas were doing impressions of Lumbergh. Cohen asked Judge if they were only doing it because he was present, whereupon the barista turned around and asked the two if they had ever seen the movie.

Other cast members found the film had reached people when strangers began associating them with their characters. Cole, who had previously worked service jobs including bartending, said that he had not realised &quot;the scope of the office audience&quot; until a year after release, when people began shouting dialogue from the movie at him. Aniston says that even today, when she is eating &quot;at a certain type of restaurant&quot;, people will ask if she likes their flair.

The cable channel Comedy Central premiered &quot;Office Space&quot; on August 5, 2001; that airing drew 1.4 million viewers. By 2003, the channel had broadcast the film another 35 times. These broadcasts helped develop the film&#x27;s cult following; Livingston credits the regular airings the film received on Comedy Central for making &quot;Office Space&quot; a cult favorite: &quot;It felt like it kind of went viral before that concept even existed.&quot;

Since then, Livingston has been approached by college students and office workers. He said, &quot;I get a lot of people who say, &#x27;I quit my job because of you.&#x27; That&#x27;s kind of a heavy load to carry.&quot; Livingston says that people tell him watching &quot;Office Space&quot; made them feel better, which he still appreciates.

==Legacy==
&quot;Office Space&quot; has become a cult classic, selling well on home video and DVD. , it had sold 2.6 million copies on VHS and DVD. In the same year, it was in the top 20 best-selling Fox DVDs. , it had sold over six million DVDs in the United States alone.

Four years after the film&#x27;s release, Judge recalled that one of his assistant directors on the film told him they had gone out to eat at a TGI Fridays and noticed that the waitstaff were no longer wearing buttons on their uniforms, the &quot;flair&quot; Joanna quits her job over in the film. Asked why, the manager told him that after &quot;Office Space&quot; had come out, customers started making jokes about it, so the chain dropped the requirement from its dress code. &quot;So, maybe I made the world a better place&quot; he told &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; in 2014.

In 2008, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked it fifth on its list &quot;25 Great Comedies From the Past 25 Years&quot;, despite having originally given the film a poor review. In February 2009, a reunion of many of the cast members took place at the Paramount Theatre in Austin to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the film. Rothman said in 2019 that despite his connection to several films that won the Academy Award for Best Picture, he hopes &quot;Office Space&quot; will be mentioned before them in his obituary.

&quot;[&quot;Office Space&quot;] spoke to a generation in a way that few movies have,&quot; said John Altschuler, who produced &quot;Extract&quot;, Judge&#x27;s later companion piece. &quot;Nobody does this kind of material. It&#x27;s all about the weirdness of real people in real life.&quot;

In a 2017 profile of Judge, &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; writer Willy Staley observed that the film has been compared to Herman Melville&#x27;s short story &quot;Bartleby, the Scrivener&quot;, in which a lawyer&#x27;s clerk, like Peter, shows up at the office one day but declines all work, telling his boss &quot;I would prefer not to&quot;. Staley&#x27;s own high school English teacher, he recalled, brought up &quot;Office Space&quot; in class to get students to appreciate how tedious Franz Kafka&#x27;s work at an insurance company was. &quot;It&#x27;s such a brutal portrayal of workplace misery that its most useful points of comparison date back to when office culture was first unleashed on humanity.&quot;

The film was an influence on the creation of the television series &quot;Severance&quot;, and the comic book series &quot;Chew&quot;, with the film&#x27;s main characters cameoing in its third installment, &quot;&quot;.

In 2022 software engineer Ermenildo Valdez Castro was inspired by the movie &quot;Office Space&quot;, conducting a similar scheme from the movie by editing code to divert shipping fees to a personal account. A report from the Seattle police mentions that a folder named &quot;OfficeSpace project&quot; was found on Castro&#x27;s work laptop and Castro admitted he was indeed inspired by the movie. Castro stole over $300,000 from the company Zulily.

In 2024 at the South by Southwest conference, there was an Office Space Reunion panel with Judge, Livingston, Root, Naidu and Herman.

===In culture===

Several elements of the film have become memes reused in other contexts. &quot;TPS report&quot; has come to connote pointless, mindless paperwork, and an example of &quot;literacy practices&quot; in the work environment that are &quot;meaningless exercises imposed upon employees by an inept and uncaring management&quot; and &quot;relentlessly mundane and enervating&quot;. According to Judge, the abbreviation stood for &quot;Test Program Set&quot; in the movie. The PC LOAD LETTER error message has likewise become a stand-in for any confusing, vague message from a computer, especially printers. The printer scene has been widely parodied, including by one U.S. presidential campaign, and the popularity of Milton&#x27;s red stapler led the manufacturer to make a real one for sale.
The film is credited with coining the now-popular slang term &quot;ass clown&quot;, from one of the characters using it to refer to singer Michael Bolton. In 2015, the comedy website Funny or Die put together several videos in which it spliced in the actual Michael Bolton over Herman in scenes from the film. Most of them were ones that referenced the confusion coming from the character and the singer having the same name. Bolton performed the scenes exactly as Herman had, with one exception: in his conversation with Samir, he turned to the camera and substituted the words &quot;extremely talented&quot; for &quot;no-talent&quot; before &quot;ass-clown&quot;.

====Printer scene====

Before the 2009 Austin reunion screening a printer was destroyed outside the theater, in reference to the scene in the film during which Peter, Michael, and Samir destroy the dysfunctional printer on the latter two&#x27;s final day at Initech That scene has frequently been parodied; often by amateurs, using a similar electronic device, in an open space somewhere, emulating the original&#x27;s character blocking, camera angles and moves, sound effects and use of slow motion, all set to Geto Boys&#x27; &quot;Still&quot;.

The Fox animated series &quot;Family Guy&quot; did its own parody of the scene in 2008, during the show&#x27;s seventh season. In &quot;I Dream of Jesus&quot;, the season&#x27;s second episode, Brian and Stewie Griffin (both voiced by Seth MacFarlane), tired of Peter Griffin constantly playing The Trashmen&#x27;s &quot;Surfin&#x27; Bird&quot;, steal his 45 rpm single of the song and demolish it in a similar scene. For television, a clean version of &quot;Still&quot; had to be used.

During the campaign for the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential election, Texas senator Ted Cruz ran a political advertisement parodying the scene, showing an impersonator of likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and two assistants destroying her personal email server with a baseball bat in an open field.

==== Red stapler ====

Stephen Root says he realized the movie&#x27;s impact when people started asking him to sign their staplers. The red Swingline stapler featured prominently in the film was not available until April 2002 when the company released it in response to repeated requests by fans of the film. Its appearance in the film was achieved by taking a standard Swingline stapler and spray-painting it red. Root says when he shows up on sets today, the crew has usually ordered several boxes of red Swingline staplers and left them waiting for him.

==In other media==

===Video game===
Kongregate released a mobile game based on the film, titled &quot;Office Space: Idle Profits&quot;, on iOS and Android in 2017. It was a free-to-play idle clicker that offered in-app purchases. In 2022 it was shut down.

===Soundtrack===
;Track listing
==Possible sequels==

Shortly after the release of &quot;Office Space&quot;, Judge, despite his disappointment at the movie&#x27;s lackluster box office, began writing the script for &quot;Extract&quot;, which he describes as a companion piece. The studio later asked him to put it aside to work on &quot;Idiocracy&quot;, which it believed would be more commercial. After that film, like &quot;Office Space&quot;, failed at the box office but became a cult favorite, Judge returned to &quot;Extract&quot; and it was released in 2009. It similarly makes light of workplace dysfunction, but from the perspective of a manager rather than a worker.

&quot;There&#x27;s been talk of doing more with &quot;Office Space&quot;, as a show or sequel, but it&#x27;s never seemed right,&quot; Judge said ahead of the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary. As for the former possibility, he recalled that because of the film, NBC offered him the chance to shape the American version of the British sitcom &quot;The Office&quot;, which similarly bases its humor in depictions of the absurdity of white-collar work and its effect on those who do it. Among the material the network sent, however, were some reviews, one of which said the series &quot;succeeds where movies like &quot;Office Space&quot; failed.&quot; Judge passed on the offer.

==Politics==
For most of its history, Scott County was primarily a Republican county. From 1880 to 1984, it only supported a Democrat for president nine times, six of which were national Democratic landslides. In more recent elections, the county has become consistently Democratic in presidential elections like many other midsize urban counties nationwide, with the party&#x27;s candidates winning the county in every presidential election from 1988 on. Despite these victories, their margins of victory have not been as wide as in many other counties of similar composition, especially in 2016 when Hillary Clinton only won the county by 1,291 votes; yet Scott County remains relatively Democratic-leaning. However, in the 2022 elections, Republicans swept Scott County, with the county voting for the Republican candidates for all statewide offices, as well as for Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks for U.S. House of Representatives. Notably, Republican governor Kim Reynolds won the county with a margin of over 10 points.

In 2024, Republican Donald Trump flipped Scott County in a presidential race for the first time in 40 years when it was won by Ronald Reagan in his landslide 1984 victory.

<doc id="95956" wikidata="Q156639" url="?curid=95956" title="Sac County, Iowa">
<text>Sac County is a county located in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census, the population was 9,814. The county seat is Sac City. Both were named for the Sauk people, a local Native American tribe.

In February 2007, in its third annual list of the “Best Places to Live in Rural America”, &quot;Progressive Farmer&quot; magazine placed Sac County as #7 in the overall rankings. In 2009, the magazine ranked Sac County as the tenth &quot;Best Place&quot; in the Midwest Region.

==History==
On January 13, 1846, the legislative body of the Iowa Territory authorized creation of twelve counties, with general descriptions of their boundaries. This brought the number of counties in the Iowa Territory to 22.

By the end of 1846, the territory had been accepted into the Union as the State of Iowa (December 28, 1846). By 1851, the new state had grown to the extent that the original 22 counties needed to be divided into smaller, more accessible units. Accordingly, on January 15, 1851, the Iowa General Assembly enacted an omnibus bill which created 43 new counties by reducing the previous counties. Sac County was named after the Sauk people, at that time called the Sac Indians.

It took some time for the new organization to fully function. Sac City was designated the county seat in 1856, and construction of the first county courthouse was complete in 1862. By 1873 the burgeoning population had outgrown that structure and a larger (85 x 56 feet brick) building was authorized to replace it.

The new courthouse, complete with impressive bell tower, was placed in service in January 1874, and was used until 1888 when it burned.

To replace that structure, the present courthouse was built. It was enlarged and remodeled in the 1980s.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.6%) is water.

==Politics==
The Democrats have only carried Sac County a total of 5 times since 1912: 1932 and 1936 by Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1948 by Harry S. Truman, 1964 by Lyndon B. Johnson, and 1988 by Michael Dukakis. Most of these in Democratic landslides, with 1988 being the notable big exception as Dukakis overperformed here, as he had almost everywhere else in Iowa, due to the farm crisis of the 1980s.

==History==
On January 13, 1846, the legislative body of the Iowa Territory authorized the creation of twelve counties in the Territory, with general descriptions of their boundaries. On January 17 they further enacted a resolution setting the effective date of the county government for Jasper and Polk Counties as March 1, 1846. Polk County&#x27;s name referred to United States President James K. Polk, who served from 1845 to 1849.

The first courthouse, a two-story structure, was built in Des Moines in 1846. Rapid settlement and commercial growth in the county soon rendered this building insufficient, so construction of a larger building was initiated in 1858. Due to construction delays and the onset of the Civil War, the structure was not completed until 1866. The present courthouse was erected in 1906, and in 1962 it was extensively renovated and enlarged.

==Politics==
Between 1928 and 2004, Pocahontas County was a reliable bellwether county, backing the nationwide winner in every election except for 1960 (by only 37 votes) and 1988. The county has taken a rightward turn in the 21st century. After backing George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004, John McCain in 2008, and Mitt Romney in 2012 by sizable but not huge margins, Pocahontas County swung even further right in 2016. Donald Trump took nearly 70% of the vote share in the county and won the county by an astounding 45% margin. Trump further increased these numbers in 2020, winning almost 74% of the county&#x27;s vote and increasing his margin of victory to just under 50%, and did even better in 2024, earning more than 76% of the vote and winning by nearly 54%, both records for Pocahontas County for any candidate since the beginning of the 20th century.

===Population ranking===
The population ranking of the following table is based on the 2020 census of Palo Alto County.

† &quot;county seat&quot;

==Politics==
Between 1896 and 2008, Palo Alto County was a very reliable bellwether county, backing the nationwide winner in every election except for 1984 and 1988, when a farm crisis caused a loss of Republican support in Iowa amidst an otherwise national landslide for the party in both elections. More recent elections have significantly favored Republicans, as in 2016, Donald Trump became the first nominee of any party to capture at least 65% of the county&#x27;s vote since Lyndon B. Johnson in his national landslide of 1964. Trump&#x27;s margin of victory of nearly 36% was the largest in the county since Warren G. Harding in 1920. Trump improved on his first performance in 2020, obtaining almost 68% of the vote in Palo Alto County and grew his margin of victory to over 37%. It was the best vote share for any candidate in the county since Harding a century earlier. Trump did even better again in 2024, taking nearly 72% of the vote and setting a record in Palo Alto County for the largest percentage of the vote ever obtained by a Republican candidate.

===Population ranking===

† &quot;county seat&quot;

==History==
A fire on December 11, 1991, heavily damaged the Page County Courthouse. The fire was believed to have started in the attic and spread throughout much of the building. Multiple area fire departments fought the blaze and saved the structure. Court services were relocated to several buildings in Clarinda and other areas of Page County as repairs were made to the courthouse. After years of work, the courthouse was re-occupied in March 1994.

==Politics==
Just like Cass County, Iowa, Page County has long been a Republican stronghold going back generations. Franklin D. Roosevelt in his 1932 landslide was the only Democrat to win the county post-Civil War, and even &quot;he&quot; couldn&#x27;t hold onto the county 4 years later despite winning in an even bigger landslide.

<text>O&#x27;Brien County is a county in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 14,182. The county seat is Primghar.

==History==
By the time Iowa attained statehood (December 28, 1848), its Territorial Legislature had created 44 counties. On January 15, 1851, the new State Legislature created another 49 counties, defining them by lines of survey. O&#x27;Brien was among the 49 units thus created. It consists of four survey townships, each formed by 36 square miles arranged in a 6x6 layout, for a nominal 576 square miles total area. The county was named for William Smith O&#x27;Brien, a leader for Irish independence in 1848.

The new county&#x27;s first settler arrived in 1856; Hannibal H. Waterman brought his wife and a daughter to the southeast portion (present Waterman Township). His homestead formed the nucleus of the county&#x27;s first community, and a small building was erected there to function as a courthouse.

By 1872 the county comprised several small communities, and residents of those groups felt the county&#x27;s business should be conducted in a more central location. An election was held, the outcome of which was to create a new county seat at its midpoint. A tract at the center of the county was surveyed and platted; its name (Primghar) was created from the initials of eight persons involved with the platting. The previous courthouse building was transported to this new location.

In 1874 a 35-foot square building was erected on the present location at a cost of $2,000, to replace the first structure. It was replaced in 1887 by a larger structure. The County Board of Supervisors authorized its construction, at a cost not to exceed $5,000 (the maximum amount the county was authorized to commit). To keep within this limit, members of the new community agreed to haul the building materials without charge from railroad stops at Sanborn and Paullina. The present courthouse was completed in 1917, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Politics==
O&#x27;Brien County is one of the most consistently Republican counties in Iowa. It has backed the Republican nominee in all but five elections in its history; its inaugural election in 1860, a tie in 1864, backing former Republican turned Progressive Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, and supporting Franklin D. Roosevelt during his two nationwide landslides in 1932 and 1936. Since 1952, the Republican candidate has carried O&#x27;Brien County by a margin of at least 20% in every election except for 1964, when Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson only lost the county by 41 votes amidst a nationwide Democratic landslide. In the 21st century, all Republican candidates have obtained over 65% of the county&#x27;s vote, and beginning in 2012, at least 70% of the vote.

<text>Muscatine County is a county located in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census, the population was 43,235. The county seat is Muscatine. The southeastern border is formed by the Mississippi River. Muscatine County comprises the Muscatine, IA Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Davenport-Moline, IA-IL Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
Muscatine County was formed in December 1836 as a part of Wisconsin Territory, partitioned from Des Moines County, which had been organized two years previously. One history suggests that the county was named for Muscatine Island in the Mississippi River. The island lies opposite Muscatine County and was believed to be named after the Mascouten tribe, Algonquian-speaking Native Americans who lived in the area before being driven west by settler encroachment and other tribes.

Colonel George Davenport of Illinois sent three representatives into the territory in 1833 to establish a trade post. They were the first European Americans to settle there. In the same year, James W. Casey and John Vanatta came to the area. They opened a supply depot for steamboats on June 1, 1833, and named it Casey&#x27;s Woodpile (since steamboats used wood as fuel). Muscatine County became part of Iowa Territory on July 4, 1838, when it was established by partitioning the area from Wisconsin Territory. The first public land sale was held in November 1838. One year later, officials began construction of the first courthouse and associated jail. A second jail, known as the &quot;Old Jail&quot;, was built in 1857.

The first courthouse was destroyed by fire on December 23, 1864. By 1866 a replacement stood on the same site. The present courthouse opened on September 26, 1907.

<text>Monona County is a county located in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census, the population was 8,751. The county seat is Onawa.

==History==
The area around present-day Onawa was a stopping point in 1804 for Meriwether Lewis and William Clark during their exploration of the newly obtained Louisiana Purchase. Many years later, that site was memorialized as the Lewis and Clark State Park.

Monona County was formed in 1851. It was perhaps named for an Indian word meaning &quot;beautiful valley.&quot;

Monona County was organized officially in the spring of 1854 having been a part of Benton County (every county west of Benton in a line) in 1851 and afterwards Harrison County between 1852 and 1854.

When Ashton (originally called Bloomfield) was named the county seat in the fall of 1854, a log house served as the first courthouse. Ashton remained the county seat for only four years. That designation was moved to Onawa on April 5, 1858, and the first Monona County Courthouse was completed that same year.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.7%) is water.

==Politics==
For over a century, Monona County was close to a national bellwether. Between 1900 &amp; 2004, it only failed to back the national winner in 1960 &amp; 1988. However, this bellwether status no longer applies. Barack Obama failed to carry the county in both of his electoral victories statewide &amp; nationally, while Donald Trump in 2020 earned the highest percentage of any candidate since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932, in spite of his unsuccessful reelection bid.

<text>Mills County is a county located in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census, the population was 14,484. The county seat is Glenwood. The county was formed in 1851 and named for Major Frederick Mills of Burlington, Iowa, who was killed at the Battle of Churubusco during the Mexican–American War.

Mills County is included in the Omaha–Council Bluffs metropolitan area.

==History==
The future county&#x27;s first permanent settlement was Rushville, founded in 1846 by persecuted members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as they were being driven out of Nauvoo, Illinois. This is not to be confused with the state&#x27;s present-day Rushville in Jasper County. A nearby settlement, also founded by the Mormon settlers, was called Coonsville after Dr. Liberius Coons, one of the first arrivals. That settlement continued after the Mormons moved on; its name was changed to Glenwood in 1853.

In Glenwood, the first courthouse was a small frame building which served until 1857. It was replaced by a two-story building, which was enlarged in the 1900s and received a clock tower in 1910. In 1959 this building was replaced with the present building, dedicated on August 29, 1959.

==Geography==

===Population ranking===
The population ranking of the following table is based on the 2020 census of Marshall County.

† &quot;county seat&quot;

==Politics==
Prior to 1964, Marshall County was strongly Republican, never backing a Democratic presidential candidate from 1880 to 1960 and only failing to back a Republican candidate during those years in 1912 with a strong third party campaign by former president Theodore Roosevelt on the Bull Moose ticket. Since then, it has become far more of a swing county, having backed the national winner in the seven presidential elections from 1992 to 2016. That streak was broken in 2020, when Donald Trump won the county but lost nationally. The county is considered a bellwether polity.

<text>Mahaska County is a county located in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census, the population was 22,190. The county seat is Oskaloosa.

Mahaska County was formed in February 1843. The county has been self-governing since February 5, 1844. It was named after Chief Mahaska of the Iowa tribe. The county was the first in Iowa to have a sheriff and a justice of peace.
The first courthouse was completed in January 1846. When a larger structure was required, the second courthouse was constructed in 1885–86, first being used on February 27, 1886. The first school, a small log cabin one-half mile (ca. 2 km) east of Oskaloosa, was opened on September 16, 1844, and the Cumberland Presbyterian Church opened as the first church in 1846. On July 2, 1850, the first edition of the &quot;Iowa Herald&quot; was issued (today the &quot;Oskaloosa Herald&quot;). The first tracks of the Des Moines Valley Railroad were laid through the county in 1864.

Coal mining was once a major industry in Mahaska County. During the 19th century, Muchakinock, about south of Oskaloosa, was probably the largest and most prosperous coal camp in Iowa.

==Politics==
For most of its history, Madison County has primarily supported the Republican Party in presidential elections. From 1880 to 1960, the county only failed to back the party&#x27;s candidate in 1932 when Herbert Hoover was defeated in a national landslide for reelection by Franklin D. Roosevelt. The county was much more of a swing area between 1964 and 1996, voting for the national winner in every presidential election between 1964 and 2004 aside from 1988 when Michael Dukakis was boosted to an inflated margin of victory statewide by a farm crisis. Since the start of the third millennium, Republicans have carried the county in every presidential election. Donald Trump also produced the county&#x27;s strongest Republican presidential victory since 1952 in 2016, winning by a margin of over 30 percent.

<text>Lyon County is the most northwesterly county of the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census, the population was 11,934. The county seat is Rock Rapids.

Lyon County is named in honor of Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon, who served in the Mexican–American War and the Civil War. He was killed at the Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek, Missouri, on August 10, 1861, after which the county was named for him. The county&#x27;s name was originally Buncombe County, but was changed by the state legislature on September 11, 1862.

==History==
The land that makes up Lyon County was ceded to the federal government by the Sioux Native Tribe through a treaty signed on July 23, 1851. The boundaries of the county were set on January 15, 1851, and attached to Woodbury County (then called Wahkaw County) for administration purposes. Lyon County was split from Woodbury County on January 1, 1872.

The first non-indigenous resident to live in Lyon County was Daniel McLaren, known as &quot;Uncle Dan&quot;. He lived near the Sioux River for a short time, spending his time hunting and trapping. He moved out of the county early in its settlement to stake a claim further west. The second settler in the area was known as &quot;Old Tom&quot;, a hunter and trapper who lived briefly near present-day Rock Rapids. While setting his traps, Old Tom was killed by Sioux tribespeople.

In 1862–1863, a group of men from the east coast spent time in the county on a hunting trip. They were: Roy McGregor, George Clark and Thomas Lockhart. During the winter, Lockhart and McGregor were hunting elk along the Little Rock creek and encountered a group of Sioux tribespeople. Lockhart was killed by an arrow, but McGregor was able to escape and rejoin Clark. The two continued to hunt and trap until March 1863. During a spring flood, Clark was drowned and McGregor decided to move back east.

The first permanent settlement in Lyon County was built by Lewis P. Hyde in July 1866. The county&#x27;s population reached 100 persons in 1869, entirely through migration and settlement. The first non-indigenous child born in the county was Odena Lee, born on May 28, 1871. The first election in the county was held on October 10, 1871, and recorded 97 votes.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.02%) is water.

Lyon County is the location of Gitchie Manitou State Preserve, which contains some of the oldest exposed bedrock in the country.

==Politics==
Lyon County is among the most GOP-friendly counties in Iowa. Only two Democrats have ever won the county: Grover Cleveland by a twenty-vote plurality in 1892, and Franklin D. Roosevelt in his 1932 and 1936 landslides. Though Roosevelt carried the county by a very comfortable margin in both elections, the county went back to its solid Republican roots in 1940 and has not been won by a Democrat since, with Michael Dukakis being the last Democrat to even reach 30%. The only other times someone besides a Republican won this county were in 1912 when Theodore Roosevelt carried it in the split election, and in 1924 when Robert M. La Follette carried it by a narrow plurality. Even so, both of these candidates were affiliated with the Republican Party outside of these elections.

Louisa County became a part of Iowa Territory upon its formation on July 4, 1838.

The first courthouse was a simple wood-framed building. In 1840, a second courthouse, measuring 40&#x27; x 20&#x27; (about 12 x 6 m), was constructed of stone. In 1854, a third structure was built. The courthouse used today was erected in 1928.

<text>Linn County is a county located in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census, the population was 230,299, making it the second-most populous county in Iowa. The county seat is Cedar Rapids. Linn County is named in honor of Senator Lewis F. Linn of Missouri. Linn County is included in the Cedar Rapids, IA Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

The earliest inhabitants of Linn County, prior to Anglo settlement, were the Sac and Fox tribes. Relations were described by 20th century historians as amicable. Native Americans provided food and furs to whites in exchange for merchandise.

Linn County was created as a named but unorganized area on December 21, 1837, as a part of Wisconsin Territory. It became part of Iowa Territory on July 4, 1838, when the territory was organized. Linn County was organized by the first legislative assembly of the Iowa Territory on January 15, 1839. A site was selected for its first county seat along Indian Creek, and was named Marion, after the Revolutionary War general Francis Marion. As early as 1855, there were debates over moving the county seat to the fast-growing Cedar Rapids, southwest of Marion, but it was not until November 6, 1919, that there were enough votes in favor of the move (9,960 to 4,823). The first rail line was built through Cedar Rapids in 1859, and made the town (and the county) a major commercial hub in eastern Iowa.

Many areas of the county were damaged by the flooding of Cedar River in June 2008, and again during the August 2020 Midwest derecho.

==Geography==

It last voted Republican during the landslide reelection of Ronald Reagan in 1984, and has been won by the Democrats by a margin of at least 9% in every subsequent election.

<text>Lee County is the southernmost county in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census, the population was 33,555. The county seats are Fort Madison and Keokuk. Lee County is part of the Fort Madison–Keokuk, IA–IL–MO Micropolitan Statistical Area. It was established in 1836.

==History==
Fort Madison dates to the War of 1812. Lee County was the location of the Half-Breed Tract, established by treaty in 1824. Allocations of land were made to American Indian descendants of European fathers and Indian mothers at this tract. Originally the land was to be held in common. Some who had an allocation lived in cities, where they hoped to make better livings. Lee County as a named entity was formed on December 7, 1836, under the jurisdiction of Wisconsin Territory. It would become a part of Iowa Territory when it was formed on July 4, 1838. Large-scale European-American settlement in the area began in 1839, after Congress allowed owners to sell land individually. Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) under the direction of Brigham Young fled persecutions in Missouri to settle in Illinois and Iowa. Nauvoo, across the border in Hancock County, Illinois, became the main center of Latter-day Saints settlement, but there was also a Latter Day Saints stake organized in Lee County under the direction of John Smith, the uncle of Joseph Smith, land that was sold to them by Isaac Galland in 1839.

Lee has two county seats—Fort Madison and Keokuk. The latter was established in 1847 when disagreements led to a second court jurisdiction. Lee County&#x27;s population grew to about 19,000 in 1850, the first US census, to 37,000 per the 3rd census in 1870, peaking at 44,000 people in 1960. It has continuously decreased since and as of 2020, 33,555 people lived there, comparable to the years between 1860 and 1870.

===Name===
There is no consensus about the derivation of the name &quot;Lee.&quot; It has been variously proposed that the county was named for Marsh, Delevan &amp; Lee, of Albany, New York, and the &#x27;New York Land Company&#x27;, who owned extensive interests in the Half-Breed Tract in the 1830s; Robert E. Lee, who surveyed the Des Moines Rapids; or Albert Lea, who helped explore the interior of Iowa.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (4.0%) is water. The lowest point in the state of Iowa is located on the Mississippi River in Keokuk in Lee County, where it flows out of Iowa and into Missouri and Illinois.

==Politics==
After voting for the Democratic nominee in its first two elections in 1848 and 1852 prior to the founding of the Republican Party, Jones County thereafter leaned Republican until 1988. It voted Democrat only four times between 1856 and 1984, in 1912 for Woodrow Wilson when he won with a plurality of the vote after former Republican Theodore Roosevelt ran as the Progressive candidate, leading to a fracture in the national Republican Party, then backing Franklin D. Roosevelt in his two landslide victories of 1932 and 1936, and then supporting Lyndon B. Johnson during his 1964 landslide. From 1988 to 2012, Jones County favored the Democratic nominee in each election. In 2016, Donald Trump flipped the county back to the Republican column, capturing over 56% of the county&#x27;s vote, the best Republican performance in the county since the 1972 landslide victory of Richard Nixon. Trump increased his vote share to almost 60% in 2020 and increased his margin of victory to over 21%, the first election in the county decided by a margin of over 20% since 1964.

<text>Johnson County is located in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census, the population was 152,854, making it the fourth-most populous county in Iowa. The county seat is Iowa City, home of the University of Iowa. Johnson County is included in the Iowa City metropolitan area, which is also included in the Cedar Rapids-Iowa City Corridor Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
Johnson County was established in December 1837 by the legislature of the Wisconsin Territory, one of thirteen counties established by that body in a comprehensive act. The county&#x27;s area was partitioned from Dubuque County, and was not initially provided with a civil government, instead being governed by Cedar County officials. It was originally named for the US Vice President Richard M. Johnson (1780–1850). In 2020, the Johnson County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to change the county&#x27;s namesake to be Lulu Merle Johnson (1907–1995), the first black woman in the state to earn a doctorate; Vice President Johnson was a slaveowner who had sexual relations with several of his slaves.

The first courthouse in the county was a two-story log cabin structure, built in 1838 in the settlement of Napoleon, about two miles south of the current courthouse. The building stood across from what later would become the James McCollister Farmstead on land later owned by Philip Clark.
After Iowa City was established by fiat as the new territorial capitol of Iowa, the county seat was removed there. The second Johnson County Courthouse, the first in Iowa City, was built on Lot 8 Block 8 of the County Seat Addition to Iowa City in 1842 for $3,690. This location was in the southeast corner of the intersection of Harrison and Clinton Streets. The building was 56 x 28 feet and two stories tall. It was built by James Trimble, who had previously built the first jail.

A third courthouse was built in 1857 in the courthouse square on Clinton Street between Court and Harrison Streets. It was used until 1901, after cracks appeared in its south wall in 1899. The building was apparently built of brick with stone and wood ornamentation.

The Richardsonian Romanesque style courthouse in use today was designed by the firm of Rush, Bowman and Rush of Grand Rapids, Michigan. It was bid at a cost of $111,000 and built by the firm Rowson &amp; Son of Johnson County. The cornerstone was laid in December 1899. The building&#x27;s tower was based on Henry Hobson Richardson&#x27;s design for the spire of Trinity Church in Boston. The building was dedicated on June 8, 1901. The currently unused jail that stands to the west of the courthouse was designed by C.L. Wundt of Burlington, Iowa on behalf of the Stewart Iron Works in Cleveland and bid for $14,000.

The average household size was 2.34 and the average family size was 2.97.

Age spread: 20.10% under the age of 18, 23.40% from 18 to 24, 30.80% from 25 to 44, 18.20% from 45 to 64, and 7.40% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 28 years. For every 100 females, there were 99.10 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.30 males.

==Politics==
Largely due to the presence of the University of Iowa, Johnson County is considered the most liberal county in Iowa and a stronghold of the Democratic Party, and has always been among Iowa&#x27;s most Democratic counties since the Civil War. It has been the strongest Democratic county in the state since 1984. This trend predates the recent swing toward the Democrats in counties influenced by college towns. The last Republican to win the county in a presidential election was Richard Nixon in 1960, and the last Republican to even get 40 percent of the county&#x27;s vote was Ronald Reagan in 1984. The last time the GOP won the county in a gubernatorial election was the 1978 Iowa gubernatorial election. As a measure of how strongly Democratic the county has been, Democrats easily carried it even in the national Republican landslides of 1972, 1984 and 1988, and the county was the only county in Iowa to vote for Democrat Alton B. Parker over Republican Theodore Roosevelt in 1904. In 2020, Joe Biden received the highest percentage of the vote received by any Democrat in the county&#x27;s history; indeed, by any candidate of any party. In 2024, it was the only county to not vote for Donald Trump in the state&#x27;s Republican presidential caucuses. Nikki Haley won the county by a single vote.

Johnson County&#x27;s Democratic bent is just as pronounced at the state level. It was the lone county to vote Democratic in statewide Republican landslides, such as Senator Chuck Grassley&#x27;s re-elections in 2010 and 2016 or Governor Terry Branstad&#x27;s re-election in 2014.

===Politics===
Historically, Jefferson County heavily favored presidential candidates from the Republican Party. It is noted for being one of the few counties in Iowa that never voted for Woodrow Wilson, along with having never given a Democrat who carried the county over sixty percent of the vote. In recent decades, politics within the county have become more competitive. From 1992 to 2012, the county had been carried by the Democratic presidential candidate in every election with the exception of 2000, when George W. Bush obtained a plurality. In the 1996 presidential election, Jefferson County was the only county in the United States to give any (winning) candidate less than forty percent of the vote, with Bill Clinton winning the county 35.1% to Bob Dole&#x27;s 34.4%. In 2024, Donald Trump became the first Republican to win a majority of the votes in Jefferson County since Ronald Reagan&#x27;s 1984 performance. The county has been the strongest basis of support for the Natural Law Party&#x27;s presidential campaigns, due to the presence of the Maharishi Vedic City and Maharishi International University.

Iowa County is home to the Amana Colonies, a group of settlements of German Pietists, comprising seven villages. Calling themselves the Ebenezer Society or the Community of True Inspiration (German: die Gemeinde der wahren Inspiration), they first settled in New York state near Buffalo in what is now West Seneca. However, in order to live out their beliefs in more isolated surroundings they moved west, to Iowa County in 1855, living a communal life until the mid-1930s. Today, Amana is a major tourist attraction known mainly for its restaurants and craft shops, and the colonies as a whole have been listed as a National Historic Landmark since 1965.

<text>Ida County is a county located in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census the population was 7,005, making it the state&#x27;s eighth-least populous county. The county seat is Ida Grove. The county was authorized by the Iowa Legislature in January 1851 as a packet of projected counties in unorganized territory of western Iowa. It was named after Ida Smith, the first child of European immigrants to be born in this region.

==History==
The Iowa Legislature authorized the formation of 49 counties in previously–unregulated western Iowa on January 15, 1851. This date is usually cited as the date of formation of Ida County; however, as there were no inhabitants of that area, no action was taken to form a county government.

On January 12, 1853, the Legislature authorized creation of Woodbury County, and included the proviso that the area of Ida County be included with Woodbury for revenue, election, and judicial purposes. In 1853 there were still no settlers in Ida County&#x27;s lands.

The county&#x27;s first permanent settlers (Comstock and Moorehead) arrived in 1856. In 1858 the county government was organized, with John Moorehead appointed County Judge. There were about 40 county residents at that time.

The county&#x27;s only postoffice, as well as the first courthouse, was operated from Judge Moorehead&#x27;s house.

The county&#x27;s first dedicated school building was raised in 1861.

The county&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;Ida County Pioneer&quot;, was started in 1872. The first bank opened in 1876. Railroads arrived in Ida County in 1877, when the Maple Valley branch of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway was built. This resulted in a flood of settlers, and within five years, nearly all the available land had been purchased.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.1%) is water.

<text>Humboldt County is a county in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census, the population was 9,597. The county seat is Dakota City. The county was created in 1857 and named in honor of Alexander von Humboldt.

==History==
===Founding===
Iowa&#x27;s entry to the union was approved by Congress on March 3, 1845, with statehood beginning on December 28, 1846, following approval of the state&#x27;s constitution and boundaries. In order to establish county government across the state, the Iowa General Assembly passed an act on January 15, 1851, which created fifty counties in the half of the state where county government had not yet been established. Humboldt County was created by this act, containing its present area, as well as four townships in present-day Webster County: Jackson, Deer Creek, Badger, and Newark. It was named after Alexander von Humboldt. On January 21, 1855, an act merged the northern half of Humboldt County and Bancroft County into Kossuth County, with the southern half of Humboldt County merging into Webster County.

The Sixth General Assembly passed another act, reestablishing Humboldt County. The act was passed on January 28, 1857, and went into effect on February 26. However, an error omitted the lower four townships (Jackson, Deer Creek, Badger, and Newark) from returning to Humboldt County. The error was not caught until the next session of the general assembly, and the general assembly passed a bill redefining Humboldt County to include the four townships on March 11, 1858. However, in the interceding time, the Constitution of Iowa came into effect, including the provision that &quot;future laws altering county boundaries should be submitted to a vote of the people of the counties concerned and must be approved by them before going into effect&quot;. In a court case originating in the disputed area, the Iowa Supreme Court was asked to decide which county court had original jurisdiction. In their clarification, they ruled the March 11, 1858, clarification of Humboldt County&#x27;s boundaries unconstitutional, as it had not been submitted to a public vote in the counties involved. In his decision, Chief Justice Ralph P. Lowe wrote, &quot;We are compelled to conclude that township 90, in ranges 27 to 30, west of the 5th principal meridian, is still in and forms a part of Webster county. Of course we can pay no attention to conjectural surmises and vague suspicions, which have been made and entertained in relation to some unfairness which may have been practiced in the final passage of the act of 1857, creating the county of Humboldt. If such was the case, no evidence of the fact has been presented to us.&quot; The &quot;vague suspicions&quot; include a rumor that John Duncombe of Fort Dodge (namesake of Duncombe, Iowa and plaintiff in the lawsuit) had tricked Humboldt County into ceding the southern four townships to Webster County &quot;on loan&quot;, or was otherwise responsible for the &quot;error&quot;.

In 1872, Humboldt College was opened and closed in 1916 because there was no agreement with the county about taxation.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which is land and (0.3%) is water.

Unlike all counties to its east and west, Humboldt County has only 12 townships. Although founded with the standard 16 townships on January 15, 1851, the county was removed from existence in 1855.

===Adjacent counties===
*Kossuth County (north)
*Wright County (east)
*Webster County (south)
*Pocahontas County (west)

===Ecology===
Humboldt County is located entirely within the Des Moines Lobe of the Western Corn Belt Plains ecoregion, as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). One of the flattest regions in Iowa, the Des Moines Lobe ecoregion is a distinctive area naturally defined by Wisconsin glaciation but modified by humans for extensive agriculture. In general, the land is level to gently rolling with some areas of relief defined by glacial features like moraines, hummocky knobs, and kettles, and outwash deposits. The lobe does not have any loess deposits like the Loess Hills to the west.

The stream network is poorly developed and widely spaced, with major rivers carving valleys that are relatively deep and steep-sided. Almost all of the natural lakes of Iowa are found in the northern part of this region (the Iowa Great Lakes). Most of the region has been converted from wet prairie to agricultural use with substantial surface water drainage. Only a small fraction of the wetlands remain, and many natural lakes have been drained as a result of agricultural drainage projects via drainage tiles or ditches.

===Hydrology===
Humboldt County is located within the Des Moines River watershed. The East and West Forks of the Des Moines River merge at Frank Gotch State Park in southern Humboldt County. The eastern part of Humboldt County is within the Boone River watershed, a tributary of the Des Moines.

===Protected areas===

While Humboldt County does not have any state parks, it has county parks. South of Humboldt is Frank A. Gotch County Park. It is named for Frank Gotch, a world-champion, undefeated wrestler from Humboldt. The park is near his childhood farm and is also home to the confluence of the East and West Forks of the Des Moines River. The park features campgrounds and a well-known converted railroad bridge used by the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway. The bridge is part of the Three Rivers Trail, a converted rail route that runs from Eagle Grove west to Rolfe.

Near Bradgate is the Willow Access Area. The terrain is very wooded. In south Rutland is Rose Mill Park. The area can be used for camping and also has access to the Rutland Dam and West Fork of the Des Moines River. The dam is being restored, and most of the park is new. The river is known for its forested limestone bluffs and grassy banks.
Further downriver near Humboldt is Oxbow Park, which contains boating access ramps and much scenic open space. The park&#x27;s southern border is Iowa Highway 3, and south of that is Joe Sheldon County Park. The park is split into two sections, one mostly for camping and one focused on recreation. There is access to the West Fork of the Des Moines River from the lower part of the park.

Continuing along the river, the Lake Nokomis area begins, popular for its woods and small ponds. The Cottonwood Trail also runs through the area.

West of Livermore, Lott&#x27;s Park allows access to Lott&#x27;s Creek. The park has many benches and picnic tables. South of Ottosen is the Ottosen Marsh State Game Management Area, colloquially the Ottosen Potholes. East of Dakota City is the Dakota City River Park, near an old dam and the Humboldt County Historical Museum. Near the unincorporated community of Pioneer is the Pioneer Prairie Pothole Wildlife Area.

==Politics==
From 1972 to 2012, Howard County leaned Democratic in presidential elections. Republicans only carried the county three times, all amidst national landslides, and the county almost always weighed in to the left of the national popular vote. However, in 2016, the county swung dramatically towards Republican Donald Trump, going from a 21-point Democratic margin in 2012 to a more than 20-point Republican margin in 2016. With this 41-point swing, Howard County voted Republican in a presidential election for the first time since 1984, with Trump&#x27;s 57.27% vote share marking the strongest Republican performance in the county since 1952. In 2020, Trump further expanded his vote share to 63.07%, the best performance for any candidate in Howard County since Warren G. Harding a century earlier. Trump improved yet again in 2024, taking more than 65% of the vote in the county.

† &quot;county seat&quot;

==Politics==
Grundy County has long been one of the most consistently Republican counties in Iowa. The county has only voted for a candidate of a different party four times since the county was founded in 1851. The first occasion was in 1912, when former Republican Theodore Roosevelt won the county as the Progressive candidate. During his two landslide victories of 1932 and 1936, Franklin D. Roosevelt became the first Democrat to win Grundy County in its history. The final time a non-Republican candidate carried the county was in 1964, when Lyndon B. Johnson won in a nationwide landslide. No Democratic candidate has ever received more than 60% of the vote in the county, and in the last twenty-one elections (beginning in 1944), the Republican obtained at least 60% of the vote in sixteen of them, and the Republicans have hit at least 65% in ten of the twenty-one elections in that span.

<text>Dubuque County is a county located in the U.S. state of Iowa. As of the 2020 census, the population was 99,266, making it the eighth-most populous county in Iowa. The county seat is Dubuque. The county is named for Julien Dubuque, the first European settler of Iowa.

Dubuque County comprises the Dubuque, IA Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
===Early history===
Dubuque County is named for French trader Julien Dubuque, the first European settler of Iowa, and an early lead mining pioneer in what is now Dubuque County. Dubuque was French Canadian, and had (by most accounts) a friendly relationship with the local Meskwaki people. He and other early pioneers established a lucrative mining and trading industry in the area. When lead deposits began becoming exhausted, the pioneers developed boat building, lumber yards, milling, brewing, and machinery manufacturing to take its place.

The city of Dubuque was chartered in 1833 as the first city in Iowa. The establishment of the City of Dubuque in 1833 led to large-scale settlement of the surrounding area. This was greatly encouraged by the Roman Catholic Church, which sent priests, bishops, and nuns to establish churches in the unpopulated countryside. Primarily, Irish and German (many of whom were Catholic) immigrants came to the region.

At an extra session of the Sixth Legislative Assembly of Michigan Territory held in September 1834, the Iowa District was divided into two counties by running a line due west from the lower end of Rock Island in the Mississippi River. The territory north of this line (which started just south of the present-day Davenport) was named Dubuque County, and all south of it was Demoine County &quot;[sic]&quot;. Thus, at that time Dubuque County nominally included not only much of what is now the state of Minnesota but portions of what are now North Dakota and South Dakota.

Dubuque County became part of Wisconsin Territory once it was split off from Michigan Territory on July 3, 1836. A massive reorganization and reduction of the county&#x27;s size was executed on December 21, 1837, when its original area was separated into 13 named new counties and a &quot;non-county area&quot;. The land in present day Minnesota and the Dakotas was transferred to the newly created Fayette County in this action. Dubuque County became a part of Iowa Territory upon its creation on July 4, 1838.

In 1858, Saint Francis Catholic Church was established in Dubuque County.

===Middle history===
In the 1980s, the farm crisis set in, and devastated large sections of the Midwest, including Dubuque County. Since the area was heavily dependent on agriculture-related industries like Deere and Company and the Dubuque Packing Company, unemployment soared. In one month of 1982, Dubuque County had 23% unemployment, the highest in the nation. The county experienced huge population losses during this time, as workers left the area. It would not fully recover from this until the late 1990s, when the economy diversified, shifting away from manufacturing, and toward various service-related establishments. The county is now growing and flourishing.

===Modern history===

Since the 1990s, the area has become much more prosperous. Today, the county boasts record employment levels and a growing population. The surging economy can especially be seen in the West Side of the City of Dubuque, and in neighboring Peosta and Asbury. These areas have expanded so much that concerns now lie with trying to manage the growth, a sharp change from just 20 years ago.

It is one of Iowa&#x27;s two original counties along with Des Moines County; both were organized by the Michigan Territorial legislature in 1834.

In 2021, the Dubuque County Minutemen baseball team advanced to the American Legion World Series semi-finals, the first team from Iowa to advance that far since Cedar Rapids, IA in 1975.

==Government==
Dubuque County is governed by a three-member Board of Supervisors elected at large. Current supervisors include Ann McDonough, Wayne Kenniker and Harley Pothoff (chairperson). They meet the 1st and 3rd Monday of each month at 9:00 a.m. in the Dubuque County Courthouse.

The current county attorney is Scott Nelson, who succeeded C.J. May in 2023.

The current county auditor is Kevin Dragotto, who succeeded Denise Dolan in 2021.

The current county treasurer is Michael Clasen, who succeeded Eric Steirman in 2022

===Law enforcement===
The county sheriff&#x27;s office provides law enforcement services for unincorporated areas of Dubuque County, as well as providing courthouse security, operating the county jail, and performing civil procedures. The Sheriff&#x27;s Department is located at the Dubuque City/County Law Enforcement Center. The department shares facilities and other resources with the Dubuque Police Department.

==Geography==

===Geographic features===
The county borders on Illinois and Wisconsin, and is bounded on the northeast by the Mississippi River. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.4%) is water. The county is drained by north and south forks of the Maquoketa River.

The county seat is Dubuque, Iowa, which is located along the Mississippi River in the east-central portion of the county. Eastern Dubuque County is markedly different from the western portion in that its topography is very uneven. The city of Dubuque and surrounding areas adjacent to the Mississippi River have many steep hills, bluffs, and ravines. Also, the eastern portion is more heavily wooded than the west, which is mostly rolling farmland.

Dubuque County is widely known for its impressive bluffs along the Mississippi River, which run along the entire length of the county&#x27;s riverbanks. These form part of Iowa&#x27;s Coulee Region, otherwise known as the Driftless Area. During the last ice age, much of the Mississippi Valley near Dubuque County was bypassed by glacial flows, which flattened the surrounding land in eastern Illinois, Wisconsin, and western Iowa, leaving the Driftless Area unusually rugged.

===Major parks===
The Iowa Department of Natural Resources administers 3 park and preserve areas in the county:
*Little Maquoketa River Mounds State Preserve
*Mines of Spain State Recreation Area/E. B. Lyons Nature Center
*White Pine Hollow State Forest
The Dubuque County Conservation Board administers 11 park and recreation areas in the county:

*Heritage Trail &amp; Pond
*Interstate Power Forest Preserve
*Massey Marina Park

2005 estimates by the census indicated that Dubuque had a population that identified itself as being 95.5% non-Hispanic white, 1.3% African American, 0.7% Asian and 1.5% Latino.

There were 33,690 households, of which 33.10% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.80% were married couples living together, 8.70% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.40% were non-families. 26.70% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.80% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

About 4.90% of families and 7.80% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.80% of those under age 18 and 11.00% of those age 65 or over.

==Economy==

Historically, Dubuque County&#x27;s economy was driven by heavy industry, including, among others, Deere and Company, and the now-defunct Dubuque Packing Company. However, within the last 20 years, and especially within the last 10 years, the economy has diversified a great deal. Now, alongside manufacturing, which still employs thousands of workers, many county residents work in the tourism/gaming, health care, education, publishing, and financial service sectors.

The county&#x27;s economy is largely centered around business and industry within the City of Dubuque. With the exception of industrial areas in Cascade, Dyersville, and Peosta, almost all of the rest of the county is rural and agriculturally driven. Some of the key industries in Dubuque County include: Deere and Company, Eagle Window &amp; Door Co., Flexsteel Industries, Mi-T-M Corp., A.Y. McDonald Mfg. Co., Klauer Mfg., Georgia-Pacific, and Swiss Valley Farms, among others. Besides industry, large numbers of people work for the Dubuque Community School District, Mercy Medical Center - Dubuque, Medical Associates, Finley Hospital, Prudential Financial, the City of Dubuque, and Cottingham &amp; Butler.

===Growth===
Dubuque County has, in recent years, enjoyed job growth, low unemployment, and the rapid expansion of business and commerce. Alongside these positives, the county is beginning to see a growing population, as well. Up from a recent low of 86,403 in 1990, the population is now about 97,000 and growing. This can be seen especially in the West Side of the City of Dubuque, and in nearby Asbury and Peosta. This fact is especially significant, considering that all of the counties surrounding Dubuque County have fewer people now than they did in 1900, with the exception of Grant County, Wisconsin.

==Politics==












Dubuque County was historically Democratic and supported every Democratic Party Presidential candidate from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama, with President Obama winning the county by over 20 points in 2008. In 2016, it was narrowly won by Donald Trump, who became the first Republican to win the county since President Eisenhower in 1956. Trump won the county again in 2020, by a larger margin. In the 2022 elections, the county continued to trend rightward, with Republican governor Kim Reynolds winning reelection by a margin of over 16 points. The county additionally voted for Republican Chuck Grassley in U.S. Senate election and for Republican Ashley Hinson in the election for U.S. House of Representatives for Iowa&#x27;s 1st congressional district.
