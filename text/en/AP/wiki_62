<text>Sir Roger Gilbert Bannister (23 March 1929 – 3 March 2018) was an English neurologist and middle-distance athlete who ran the first sub-4-minute mile.

At the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, Bannister set a British record in the 1500 metres and finished in fourth place. This achievement strengthened his resolve to become the first athlete to finish the mile run in under four minutes. He accomplished this feat on 6 May 1954 at Iffley Road track in Oxford, with Chris Chataway and Chris Brasher providing the pacing. When the announcer, Norris McWhirter, declared &quot;The time was three...&quot;, the cheers of the crowd drowned out Bannister&#x27;s exact time, which was 3 minutes and 59.4 seconds. He had attained this record with minimal training, while practising as a junior doctor. Bannister&#x27;s record lasted just 46 days.

Bannister went on to become a neurologist and Master of Pembroke College, Oxford, before retiring in 1993. As Master of Pembroke, he was on the governing body of Abingdon School from 1986 to 1993. When asked whether the 4-minute mile was his proudest achievement, he said he felt prouder of his contribution to academic medicine through research into the responses of the nervous system. Bannister was patron of the MSA Trust. He was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 2011.

==Early life and education==
Bannister was born on 23 March 1929 in Harrow, London. His parents Ralph and Alice were both from working-class families in Lancashire. Ralph had moved to London at the age of 15 to work in the Civil Service, and met Alice on a trip home. They married in 1925, and had a daughter, Joyce, before Roger was born.

The family moved to Bath shortly after the outbreak of World War II when Ralph was relocated there, and Roger continued his education at City of Bath Boys&#x27; School. Here he discovered a talent for cross country running, winning the junior cross-country cup three consecutive times, which led to him being presented with a miniature replica trophy.

During a bombing raid on Bath, the family house was severely damaged as the Bannisters sheltered in the basement.

In 1944, the family returned to London and Roger went to University College School. Bannister was accepted into St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge but the Senior Tutor Robert Howland, a former Olympic shot putter, suggested that Bannister wait a year. After the year he proceeded to apply to Exeter College, Oxford and was accepted for a three-year degree in Medicine.

== Athletics career ==

===Early running career===
Bannister was inspired by miler Sydney Wooderson&#x27;s comeback in 1945. Eight years after setting the mile record and seeing it surpassed during the war years by the Swedish runners Arne Andersson and Gunder Hägg, Wooderson regained his old form and challenged Andersson over the distance in several races. Wooderson lost to Andersson but set a British record of 4:04.2 in Gothenburg on 9 September.

Like Wooderson, Bannister would ultimately set a mile record, see it broken, and then set a new personal best slower than the new record.

Bannister started his running career at Oxford in the autumn of 1946 at the age of 17. He had never worn running spikes previously or run on a track. His training was light, even compared to the standards of the day, but he showed promise in running a mile in 1947 in 4:24.6 on only three weekly half-hour training sessions.

He was selected as an Olympic &quot;possible&quot; in 1948 but declined as he felt he was not ready to compete at that level. However, he was further inspired to become a great miler by watching the 1948 Olympics. He set his training goals on the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki.

In 1949, he improved in the run to 1:52.7 and won several mile races in 4:11. Then, after a period of six weeks with no training, he came in third at White City in 4:14.2.

The year 1950 saw more improvements as he finished a relatively slow 4:13-mile on 1 July with an impressive 57.5 last quarter. Then, he ran the AAA 880 in 1:52.1, losing to Arthur Wint, and then ran 1:50.7 for the 800 m at the European Championships on 26 August, placing third. Chastened by this lack of success, Bannister started to train harder and more seriously.

His increased attention to training paid quick dividends, as he won a mile race in 4:09.9 on 30 December. Then in 1951 at the Penn Relays, Bannister broke away from the pack with a 56.7 final lap, finishing in 4:08.3. Then, in his biggest test to date, he won a mile race on 14 July in 4:07.8 at the AAA Championships at White City before 47,000 people. The time set a meet record and he defeated defending champion Bill Nankeville in the process.

Bannister suffered defeat, however, when Yugoslavia&#x27;s Andrija Otenhajmer, aware of Bannister&#x27;s final-lap kick, took a 1500 m race in Belgrade 25 August out at near-record pace, forcing Bannister to close the gap by the bell lap. Otenhajmer won in 3:47.0, though Bannister set a personal best finishing second in 3:48.4. Bannister was no longer seen as invincible.

His training was a very modern individualised mixture of interval training influenced by coach Franz Stampfl with elements of block periodisation, fell running and anaerobic elements of training which were later perfected by Arthur Lydiard.

From 1951 to 1954, Bannister trained at the track at Paddington Recreation Ground in Maida Vale while he was a medical student at the nearby St Mary&#x27;s Hospital. There are two Bannister plaques at the pavilion, both unveiled by him on 10 September 2000; a circular blue plaque and a rectangular historic plaque containing additional information. According to the latter, Bannister was able to train for just an hour each day due to his medical studies.

===1952 Olympics===
Bannister avoided racing after the 1951 season until late in the spring of 1952, saving his energy for Helsinki and the Olympics. He ran an run on 28 May 1952 in 1:53.00, followed by a 4:10.6-mile time-trial on 7 June, proclaiming himself satisfied with the results. At the AAA championships, he skipped the mile and won the 880 in 1:51.5. Then, 10 days before the Olympic final, he ran a mile time trial in 2:52.9, which gave him confidence that he was ready for the Olympics as he considered the time to be the equivalent of a four-minute mile.

His confidence soon dissipated, however, as it was announced there would be semi-finals for the 1500 m at the Olympics, which he felt favoured runners who had much deeper training regimens than he did. When he ran his semi-final, Bannister finished fifth and thereby qualified for the final, but he felt &quot;blown and unhappy&quot;.

The 1500 m final on 26 July 1952 would prove to be one of the more dramatic in Olympic history. The race was not decided until the final metres, Josy Barthel of Luxembourg prevailing in an Olympic-record 3:45.28 (3:45.1 by official hand-timing) with the next seven runners all under the old record. Bannister finished fourth, out of the medals, but set a British record of 3:46.30 (3:46.0) in the process.

===New goal===
After his relative failure at the 1952 Olympics, Bannister spent two months deciding whether to give up running. He set himself on a new goal: to be the first man to run a mile in under four minutes. Accordingly, he intensified his training and did hard intervals.

On 2 May 1953, he made an attempt on the British record at Oxford. Paced by Chris Chataway, Bannister ran 4:03.6, shattering Wooderson&#x27;s 1945 standard. &quot;This race made me realise that the four-minute mile was not out of reach,&quot; said Bannister.

On 27 June 1953, a mile race was inserted into the programme of the Surrey schools athletic meeting. Australian runner Don Macmillan, ninth in the 1500 m at the 1952 Olympics, set a strong pace with 59.6 for one lap and 1:59.7 for two. He gave up after two and a half laps, but Chris Brasher took up the pace. Brasher had jogged the race, allowing Bannister to lap him so he could be a fresh pace-setter. At mile, Bannister was at 3:01.8, the record—and first sub-four-minute mile—in reach. But the effort fell short with a finish in 4:02.0, a time bettered by only Arne Andersson (4:01.6 in 1944) and Gunder Hägg (4:01.4 in 1945). British officials would not allow this performance to stand as a British record, which, Bannister felt in retrospect, was a good decision. &quot;My feeling as I look back is one of great relief that I did not run a four-minute mile under such artificial circumstances,&quot; he said.

But other runners were making attempts at the four-minute barrier and coming close as well. American Wes Santee ran 4:02.4 on 5 June 1953, the fourth-fastest mile ever. And at the end of the year, Australian John Landy ran 4:02.0.

Then early in 1954, Landy made some more attempts at the distance. On 21 January 1954, he ran 4:02.4 in Melbourne, then 4:02.6 on 23 February 1954, and at the end of the Australian season on 19 April he ran 4:02.6 again.

Bannister had been following Landy&#x27;s attempts and was certain his Australian rival would succeed with each one. But knowing that Landy&#x27;s season-closing attempt on 19 April would be his last until he travelled to Finland for another attempt, Bannister knew he had to make his attempt soon.

===Sub-4-minute mile===

This historic event took place on 6 May 1954 during a meet between British AAA and Oxford University at Iffley Road Track in Oxford, watched by about 3,000 spectators. With winds of up to before the event, Bannister had said twice that he preferred not to run, to conserve his energy and efforts to break the 4-minute barrier; he would try again at another meet. However, the winds dropped just before the race was scheduled to begin, and Bannister did run.

The pace-setters from his major 1953 attempts, future Commonwealth Games gold medallist Christopher Chataway from the 2 May attempt, and future Olympic Games gold medallist Chris Brasher from the 27 June attempt, combined to provide pacing for Bannister&#x27;s run. The race was broadcast live by BBC Radio and commentated by 1924 Olympic 100 metres champion Harold Abrahams, of &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; fame.

Bannister had begun his day at a hospital in London, where he sharpened his racing spikes and rubbed graphite on them so they would not pick up too much cinder ash. He took a mid-morning train from Paddington Station to Oxford, nervous about the rainy, windy conditions that afternoon.

Being a dual-meet format, there were seven men entered in the mile: Alan Gordon, George Dole and Nigel Miller from Oxford University; and four British AAA runners: Bannister, his two pacemakers Brasher and Chataway, and Tom Hulatt. Nigel Miller arrived as a spectator and he only realised that he was due to run when he read the programme. Efforts to borrow a running kit failed and he could not take part, thus reducing the field to six.

The race went off as scheduled at 6:00 pm, and Brasher and Bannister went immediately to the front of the pack. Brasher (wearing No. 44) led both the first lap in 58 seconds and the half-mile in 1:58, with Bannister (No. 41) tucked in behind, and Chataway (No. 42) a stride behind Bannister. Chataway moved to the front after the second lap and maintained the pace with a 3:01 split at the final lap bell. Chataway continued to lead around the front turn until Bannister began his finishing kick with about 275 yards to go (just over half a lap), running the last lap in just under 59 seconds.

The stadium announcer for the race was Norris McWhirter, who went on to co-publish and co-edit the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;. He teased the crowd by delaying his announcement of Bannister&#x27;s race time for as long as possible:

The roar of the crowd drowned out the rest of the announcement. Bannister&#x27;s time was 3 minutes 59.4 seconds.

The claim that a four-minute mile was once thought to be impossible by &quot;informed&quot; observers was and is a widely propagated myth created by sportswriters and debunked by Bannister himself in his memoir, &quot;The Four Minute Mile&quot; (1955).

The reason the myth took hold was that four minutes was a round number that lay slightly out of reach of the world record (by just 1.4 seconds) for nine years, which was longer than it might otherwise have been due to the effect of the Second World War in interrupting athletic progress in the combatant countries. The Swedish runners, Gunder Hägg and Arne Andersson, in a series of head-to-head races in the period 1942–45, had already lowered the world mile record by five seconds to the pre-Bannister record. Knowledgeable track fans are still most impressed by the fact that Bannister ran a four-minute mile on very low-mileage training by modern standards.

Just 46 days later, on 21 June 1954, Bannister&#x27;s record was broken by his rival, John Landy, in Turku, Finland, with a time of 3 minutes 57.9 seconds, which the IAAF ratified as 3 minutes 58.0 seconds due to the rounding rules then in effect.

=== 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games ===
On 7 August, at the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Vancouver, B.C., Bannister, running for England, competed against Landy for the first time in a race billed as &quot;The Miracle Mile&quot;. They were the only two men in the world to have broken the 4-minute barrier, with Landy still holding the world record.

Landy led for most of the race, building a lead of 10 yards in the third lap (of four), but was overtaken on the last bend, and Bannister won in 3 min 58.8 s, with Landy 0.8 s behind in 3 min 59.6 s. Bannister and Landy have both pointed out that the crucial moment of the race was that at the moment when Bannister decided to try to pass Landy, Landy looked over his left shoulder to gauge Bannister&#x27;s position and Bannister burst past him on the right, never relinquishing the lead.

A larger-than-life bronze sculpture of the two men at that moment was created by Vancouver sculptor Jack Harman in 1967 from a photograph by &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; photographer Charlie Warner and stood for many years at the entrance to Empire Stadium; after the stadium was demolished the sculpture was moved a short distance away to the Hastings and Renfrew entrance of the Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) fairgrounds. Regarding this sculpture, Landy quipped: &quot;While Lot&#x27;s wife was turned into a pillar of salt for looking back, I am probably the only one ever turned into bronze for looking back.&quot;

Bannister went on that season to win the so-called metric mile, the 1500 m, at the European Championships in Bern, Switzerland, on 29 August, with a championship record in a time of 3 min 43.8 s. He retired from athletics late in 1954 to concentrate on his work as a junior doctor and to pursue a career in neurology. He was appointed a CBE the following year for &quot;services to amateur athletics&quot;.

===Sports Council and knighthood===
Bannister later became the first Chairman of the Sports Council (now called Sport England) and was knighted for this service in 1975. Under his patronage, central and local government funding of sports centres and other sports facilities was rapidly increased, and he also initiated the first testing for use of anabolic steroids in sport.

== Medical career ==
After retiring from athletics in 1954, Bannister spent the next forty years practising medicine in the field of neurology. In March 1957, he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps at Crookham, where he started his two years of National Service with the rank of lieutenant.

His major contribution to academic medicine was in the field of autonomic failure, an area of neurology concerning illnesses characterised by the loss of certain automatic responses of the nervous system (for example, elevated heart rate when standing up). He ultimately published more than eighty papers, mostly concerned with the autonomic nervous system, cardiovascular physiology, and multiple system atrophy. He edited &quot;Autonomic Failure: A Textbook of Clinical Disorders of the Autonomic Nervous System&quot; with C.J. Mathias, a colleague at St Mary&#x27;s, as well as five editions of &quot;Brain and Bannister&#x27;s Clinical Neurology.&quot;

Bannister always said he was more proud of his contribution to medicine than his running career. In 2014, Bannister said in an interview: &quot;I&#x27;d rather be remembered for my work in neurology than my running. If you offered me the chance to make a great breakthrough in the study of the autonomic nerve system, I&#x27;d take that over the four minute mile right away. I worked in medicine for sixty years. I ran for about eight.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1955, Bannister married the Swedish artist Moyra Elver Jacobsson in Basel, Switzerland. Moyra Jacobsson-Bannister was the daughter of the Swedish economist Per Jacobsson, who served as managing director of the International Monetary Fund.

They had four children: Carol E. E. Bannister (b. 1957); Clive C. R. Bannister (b. 1959), an insurance industry executive; Thurstan R. R. Bannister (b. July 1960), a company director in New York; and Charlotte B. M. Bannister (b. 1963), now Charlotte Bannister-Parker, associate priest at the University Church of St Mary the Virgin in Oxford.

In 2011, Bannister was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He died of pneumonia at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford on 3 March 2018, at the age of 88, 20 days before his 89th birthday. He is buried in Wolvercote Cemetery near Oxford. His widow, Lady Moyra Bannister, died in Oxford on 4 November 2022, at the age of 94.

==Legacy==
On the 50th anniversary of running the mile in under four minutes, Bannister was interviewed by the BBC&#x27;s sports correspondent Rob Bonnet. At the conclusion of the interview, Bannister was asked whether he looked back on the sub-4-minute mile as the most important achievement of his life. Bannister replied that he instead saw his subsequent forty years of practising medicine and some of the new procedures he introduced as being more significant. He also said that, in terms of athletic achievement, he felt his performances at the 1952 Olympics and the 1954 Commonwealth Games were more significant than running the sub-4-minute mile.

Ironically, although Roger Bannister is arguably the most famous record-setter in the mile, he is also the man who held the record for the shortest period of time, at least since the IAAF started to ratify records.

=== Media ===
For his efforts, Bannister was also made the inaugural recipient of the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Sportsperson of the Year award for 1954 (awarded in January 1955) and is one of the few non-Americans recognised by the American-published magazine as such.

In a UK poll conducted by Channel 4 in 2002, the British public voted Bannister&#x27;s historic sub-4-minute mile as number 13 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.

Bannister is the subject of the ESPN film &quot;Four Minutes&quot; (2005). This film is a dramatisation, its major departures from the factual record being the creation of a fictional character as Bannister&#x27;s coach, who was actually Franz Stampfl, an Austrian, and secondly his meeting his wife, Moyra Jacobsson, in the early 1950s when in fact they met in London only a few months before the Miracle Mile itself took place. Bannister was portrayed by Jamie Maclachlan.

&quot;Bannister: Everest on the Track, The Roger Bannister Story&quot; is a 2016 TV documentary about his childhood and youth in WWII and postwar Britain and the breaking of the 4-minute mile barrier, with interviews of participants and witnesses to the 1954 race, and later runners inspired by Bannister and his achievement, including Phil Knight who says that Roger Bannister inspired him to start Nike.

In the 1988 television mini-series &quot;The Four Minute Mile&quot;, about the rivalry between Bannister, John Landy and Wes Santee to be first to break the 4-minute mile mark, Bannister was portrayed by actor Richard Huw.

=== Places ===
In 1996, Pembroke College at the University of Oxford (where Bannister was Master for eight years) named a building in honour of his achievements. The Bannister Building, an 18th-century townhouse in Brewer Street, was converted to provide accommodation for graduate students. Following extensive refurbishments during 2011 and 2012, it became part of the building complex surrounding the Rokos Quad, and was then used for undergraduate accommodation.

In March 2004, St Mary&#x27;s Hospital Medical School named a lecture theatre after Bannister; on display is the stopwatch that was used to time the race, stopped at 3:59. Bannister also gave his name to the trophy presented to the winning team in the annual athletics varsity match between Imperial College School of Medicine and Imperial College London, as well as the award given to the graduating doctor of Imperial College School of Medicine who has achieved most in the sporting community. Bannister also purchased the cup (which bears his name) awarded to the winning team in the annual United Hospitals Cross-Country Championship, organised by London Universities and Colleges Athletics. The championship is contested by the five medical schools in London and the Royal Veterinary College.

In 2012, Bannister carried the Olympic flame at the site of his memorable feat, in the Oxford University track stadium now named after him.
On 28 September 2021, a memorial stone honouring Sir Roger, &quot;pioneering neurologist, world champion runner&quot;, was unveiled in Westminster Abbey, in the area known as &quot;Scientists&#x27; corner&quot;.

===Memorabilia===
The 50th anniversary of Bannister&#x27;s achievement was marked by a commemorative British 50-pence coin. The reverse of the coin shows the legs of a runner and a stopwatch (stopped at 3:59.4). There were 9,032,500 minted. The coin was re-struck for collector sets in 2019 as part of the Royal Mint&#x27;s &#x27;50 Years of the 50p coin&#x27;, along with other designs.

In the gallery of Pembroke College dining hall, there is a cabinet containing over 80 exhibits covering Bannister&#x27;s athletic career and including some academic highlights.

=== Anniversary Races ===
On 6 May 2024, exactly seventy years after Bannister&#x27;s sub-four minute mile, hundreds of runners converged in Oxford to run a mile in Bannister&#x27;s honor. The event saw thousands run a &quot;Community Mile&quot;, and several races for elite runners on the Iffley Track. In the elite mile, four athletes broke the four minute barrier, with Italy&#x27;s Ossama Meslek clocking the fastest mile, at 3:56.15.

This is the second time Iffley Track hosted an anniversary event for Bannister&#x27;s achievement, with the previous time being in 2004.

Retired, accomplished milers including Steve Cram, Hicham El Guerrouj, Filbert Bayi, Noureddine Morceli, and Eamonn Coghlan attended, all of whom have had the mile world record to their name. Bayi ran 3:51.0 in May 1975, holding the mile world record for three months until August 1975, when John Walker of New Zealand ran 3:49.4. Cram ran 3:46.32 in 1985, holding the mile world record until Noureddine Morceli of Algeria ran 3:44.39 in 1993. Finally, on 7 July 1999, El Guerrouj ran 3:43.13, the current mile world record to this day, which is over sixteen seconds faster than Bannister&#x27;s 3:59.4. Although not an outdoor record, Coghlan set an indoor mile world record of 3:49.78 in 1983, which was bettered by El Guerrouj in 1997 who ran 3:48.45.

==Awards and honours==

Bannister received many honours for his achievements in sports and medicine. He was knighted in the 1975 New Year Honours, and appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to sport.

Bannister was an Honorary Fellow of both Exeter College and Merton College, where he studied at the University of Oxford; he was also Honorary Fellow of Harris Manchester College, Oxford. He received honorary degrees (Doctor of Science) from the University of Sheffield in 1978, and from the University of Bath in 1984. He also received honorary degrees from the University of Pavia in 1986 and from Brunel University London in 2008 (DUniv), as well as an honorary doctorate from Oxford Brookes University in 2014. In 2000, Bannister received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Bannister was made an Honorary Freeman of the London Borough of Harrow on 4 May 2004, and was granted the Freedom of the City of Oxford in 2004.

<text>&quot;The Snow Queen&quot; () is an 1844 original fairy tale by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen. It was first published 21 December 1844 in &quot;New Fairy Tales. First Volume. Second Collection&quot; (&quot;Nye Eventyr. Første Bind. Anden Samling&quot;). The story centers on the struggle between good and evil as experienced by Gerda and her friend, Kai. Unlike Andersen&#x27;s other stories, &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; is written in a novel-styled narrative, being divided into seven chapters.

The story is one of Andersen&#x27;s longest and most highly acclaimed stories. It is regularly included in selected tales and collections of his work and is frequently reprinted in illustrated storybook editions for children.

==Story==
===A mirror and its fragments===
The devil, in the form of a troll, has made a magic mirror that distorts the appearance of everything that it reflects. The mirror does not reflect the good and beautiful aspects of people and things but magnifies their bad and ugly aspects. The troll&#x27;s minions take the mirror all over the world to distort everything, then carry it up to heaven to mock God and the angels. As they approach heaven, the mirror trembles and falls, shattering into billions of pieces. Some become windowpanes, some spectacles, and some get stuck in people&#x27;s hearts and eyes, giving them a cold and bitter disposition. The troll laughs himself sore at his mischief.

===Kai and Gerda===

Years later, a little boy Kai (often spelled &quot;Kay&quot; or &quot;Kaj&quot; in translations) and a little girl Gerda live next door to each other in the garrets of buildings with adjoining roofs in a large city. They could get from one&#x27;s home to the other&#x27;s just by stepping over the gutters of each building. The two families grow vegetables and roses in window boxes placed on the gutters. Gerda and Kai have a window box garden to play in, and they become devoted to each other as playmates, and as close as if they were siblings.

Gerda&#x27;s grandmother tells the children about the Snow Queen, who is ruler over the &quot;snow bees&quot;snowflakes that look like bees. As bees have a queen, so do the snow bees, and she is seen where the snowflakes cluster the most. Looking out of his frosted window one winter, Kai sees the Snow Queen, who beckons him to come with her. Kai draws back in fear from the window.

By the following spring, Gerda has learned a song that she sings to Kai: Because roses adorn the window box garden, the sight of roses always reminds Gerda of her love for Kai.

On a summer day, splinters of the troll&#x27;s mirror get into Kai&#x27;s heart and eye. Kai becomes cruel and aggressive. He destroys their window-box garden, he makes fun of Gerda&#x27;s grandmother, and he no longer cares about Gerda, since everyone now appears bad and ugly to him. When winter comes again, the only things he finds no fault in are snowflakes, which he studies through a magnifying glass. Kai goes out with his sled to play in the snowy market square and hitches it to a sleigh driven by a mysterious robed figure. The sleigh drives through the town gate, going faster and faster through the countryside, then stops, and the driver reveals herself to be the Snow Queen. She kisses Kai to numb him from the cold, and again to make him forget about Gerda and his family. They then fly together in the sleigh up into the clouds.

===The magician woman&#x27;s garden===
The people of the city conclude that Kai died in the nearby river. When spring arrives, Gerda goes to the river and offers it her favorite red shoes if the river will return Kai. The shoes wash back to shore, so she climbs into a nearby boat to throw them out farther. The boat is unmoored, drifts away from the shore and becomes caught in the current.

Gerda drifts until she reaches the home of an old woman, who pulls her to shore with her crooked staff. The woman is a sorceress and wants Gerda to stay with her forever, so she causes Gerda to forget Kai, and causes all the roses in her garden to sink beneath the earth, since she knows that the sight of them will remind Gerda of her friend. The woman lets Gerda play in her flower garden day after day, where all of the flowers are in bloom, until one day she notices a rose on the woman&#x27;s hat. She remembers Kai and begins to cry, and her tears raise one of the rose bushes from the ground. The roses assure her that Kai is not dead, since they could see all of the dead while they were underground. Gerda questions the other flowers; each sings its own song, but none have anything to say about Kai. Gerda flees the garden and discovers that autumn has arrived while she was there.

===The prince and the princess===
Gerda meets a crow, who tells her that he might have seen Kai. He explains that a clever princess in the land decided that she should get married as soon as she could find a man good for conversation. For two days men met the princess in hopes of marrying her, but upon meeting her they were tongue-tied. On the third day, a small fellow with shabby clothes walked confidently into the palace and won over the princess by listening to her. Gerda sneaks into the palace with the crow but finds that the prince is not Kai after all. She is offered hospitality in the palace, but instead asks for a horse, carriage and boots so she can continue looking for Kai.

===The little robber girl===
While traveling in the carriage Gerda is captured by robbers. Her life is spared when a little robber girl demands to have Gerda as a playmate. They ride together to the robbers&#x27; castle, where the girl&#x27;s pet doves tell Gerda that they saw Kai when he was carried away by the Snow Queen in the direction of Lapland. The captive reindeer Bae tells her that he knows how to get to Lapland since it is his home.

===The Lapp woman and Finn woman===

The robber girl frees Gerda and the reindeer to travel north to the Snow Queen&#x27;s palace. They make two stops: first at the Lapp woman&#x27;s home and then at the Finn woman&#x27;s home. The Finn woman tells the reindeer that the secret of Gerda&#x27;s unique power to save Kai is in her sweet and innocent child&#x27;s heart:
===In the Snow Queen&#x27;s palace===

When Gerda reaches the Snow Queen&#x27;s palace, she is halted by the snowflakes guarding it. She prays the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, which causes her breath to take the shape of angels, who resist the snowflakes and allow Gerda to enter the palace. Gerda finds Kai alone and almost immobile on a frozen lake, which the Snow Queen calls the &quot;Mirror of Reason&quot;, on which her throne sits. Kai is engaged in the task that the Snow Queen gave him: he must use pieces of ice like a Chinese puzzle to form characters and words. If he is able to form the word that the Snow Queen told him to spell, she will release him from her power and give him a pair of skates.

Gerda runs up to Kai and kisses him, and he is saved by the power of her love: Gerda weeps warm tears on him, melting his heart and burning away the mirror splinter in it. As a result, Kai bursts into tears, which dislodges the splinter from his eye, and becomes cheerful and healthy again. He remembers Gerda, and the two dance around so joyously that the splinters of ice that Kai had been playing with are caught up into the dance. When they tire of dancing the splinters fall down to spell &quot;eternity,&quot; the very word Kai was trying to spell. Kai and Gerda leave the Snow Queen&#x27;s domain with the help of the reindeer, the Finn woman, and the Lapp woman. They meet the robber girl, and from there they walk back to their home. Kai and Gerda find that everything at home is the same, and that it is &quot;they&quot; who have changed; they are now grown up, and are also delighted to see that it is summertime.

At the end, the grandmother reads a passage from the Bible:

==Characters==

* Gerda (), a little girl who succeeds in finding her friend Kai and saving him from the Snow Queen.
* Kai () in Danish and Norwegian (often spelled Kay or Kaj in other European languages including English), a little boy who lives in a large city, in the garret of a building across the street from the home of Gerda, his playmate, whom he loves dearly. He falls victim to the splinters of the troll-mirror and the blandishments of the Snow Queen.
* The Snow Queen (), the queen of the snowflakes or &quot;snow bees&quot;, who travels throughout the world with the snow. Her palace and gardens are in the lands of permafrost, specifically Spitsbergen. She takes Kai back to this palace after he has fallen victim to the splinters of the troll-mirror. She promises to free Kai if he can spell &quot;eternity&quot; with the pieces of ice in her palace.
* The Troll () or the Devil (), who makes an evil mirror that distorts reality and later shatters to infect people with its splinters that distort sight and freeze hearts. Some English translations of &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; translate this character as the &quot;sprite&quot; or the &quot;hobgoblin&quot;.
* The Grandmother (), Gerda&#x27;s grandmother, who tells him and Gerda the legend of the Snow Queen.
* The Old Lady who Knew Magic (), who maintains a cottage on the river, with a garden that is permanently in summer. She seeks to keep Gerda with her, but Gerda&#x27;s thought of roses (the flower most favoured by herself and Kai) awakens her from the old woman&#x27;s enchantment.
* The Crow (), who thinks that the new prince of his land is Kai.
* The Tame Crow (), who is the mate of the field crow and has the run of the princess&#x27;s palace. She lets Gerda into the royal bedchamber in her search for Kai.
* The Princess (), who desires a prince-consort as intelligent as she, and who finds Gerda in her palace. She helps Gerda in her search for Kai by giving her warm, rich clothing, servants, and a golden coach.
* The Prince (), formerly a poor young man, who comes to the palace and passes the test set by the princess to become prince.
* The Old Robber Woman (), the only woman among the robbers who capture Gerda as she travels through their region in a golden coach.
* The Little Robber Girl (), daughter of the robber hag. She takes Gerda as a playmate, whereupon her captive doves and reindeer Bae tell Gerda that Kai is with the Snow Queen. The Robber Girl then helps Gerda continue her journey to find Kai.
* Bae (; ), the reindeer who carries Gerda to the Snow Queen&#x27;s palace.
* The Lappish Woman (), who provides shelter to Gerda and Kai, and writes a message on a dried cod fish to the Finnish Woman further on the way to the Snow Queen&#x27;s gardens.
* The Finnish Woman (), who lives just two miles away from the Snow Queen&#x27;s gardens and palace. She knows the secret of Gerda&#x27;s power to save Kai.

==Background==
Andersen met Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind in 1840 and became infatuated with her, but she was not interested in him romantically (although the two became friends). According to Carole Rosen, Andersen was inspired to model the icy-hearted Snow Queen on Lind after she rejected him as a suitor.

<text>The Abercrombie River National Park is a protected national park that is located in the Central Tablelands region of New South Wales, in eastern Australia. The national park is situated approximately west of Sydney and south of .

==Features==
The park includes the catchments of Silent Creek and the Retreat River, as well as a section of the Abercrombie River. The Abercrombie River National Park protects an important area of remnant bushland within the south-western Central Tablelands. It contains a diversity of vegetation communities characteristic of montane and tableland species as well as of the western slopes of New South Wales. The park makes an important contribution to nature conservation in the Central West by providing habitat for a number of animal species with large home range requirements and low domestic densities. The park provides opportunities for vehicle touring, bushwalking, swimming, fishing, picnicking and camping amid spectacular scenery. It also provides a pleasant natural break in the landscape between vast areas of cleared grazing land and large areas of pine plantations.

<text>Bago Bluff is a national park in New South Wales, Australia, approximately 410 km northeast of Sydney. It is situated south west of Wauchope and includes parts of the former Broken Bago State Forest and a part of Lorne State Forest. The Bago Bluff National Park also includes in the northern section the old Bago Bluff Flora Reserve and Six B Flora Reserve.

Bago Bluff offers splendid views of the Hastings Valley from the top of the bluff which can be accessed via several forest roads from the south, including Bago Road. The park&#x27;s northern boundary is on southern side of the Oxley Highway where there are two badly washed 4WD tracks into the park.

Quarries in the park have previously yielded leaf and shell fossils.

Birds that may be spotted in the park include: Australian magpies (&quot;Gymnorhina tibicen&quot;), golden whistlers (&quot;Pachycephala pectoralis&quot;), green winged pigeons, grey fantails (&quot;Rhipidura&quot;), kookaburras (genus &quot;Dacelo&quot;), large-billed scrubwrens (&quot;Sericornis magnirostris&quot;), spotted pardalotes (&quot;Pardalotus punctatus&quot;), pied currawongs (&quot;Strepera graculina&quot;), striated thornbills (&quot;Acanthiza lineata&quot;) and white-browed scrubwrens (&quot;Sericornis frontalis&quot;).

Lantana has become a problem in the park where it is almost covering some of the tracks.

<doc id="100973" wikidata="Q804731" url="?curid=100973" title="Bald Rock National Park">
<text>Bald Rock National Park is a national park in northern New South Wales, Australia, just north of Tenterfield on the Queensland border. The border passes over the rock on the Western side. On the other side of the border national park continues as the Girraween National Park.

The park is named after its most prominent feature, Bald Rock, which is a large granite outcrop rising 260 metres above the surrounding landscape and almost 1300 metres above sea level. Measuring about 750 metres long and 500 metres wide this is the largest granite monolith in Australia. Access to the rock is provided by a sealed road into the park and walking tracks to the summit. Two tracks are marked, a steep one up the exposed face, or an easier gradient through bushland around the back. The Bungoona Walking Track, constructed in 1980, ascends gently along the eastern side of Bald Rock, meandering through forested areas. Along the way, it traverses granite boulder formations, including a moss-covered arch adorned with ferns and orchids. The summit offers panoramic views of the surrounding bushland, but vegetation on top prevents a full 360° view. The views are so expansive, mountains as far north as the Queensland/New South Wales border can be seen, such as Mount Barney, Mount Lindesay and Flinders Peak, and as far south as Mount MacKenzie, south of Tenterfield.
The park is in the New England granite belt, where about 220 million years ago an episode of granite magmatism resulted in the intrusion of the Stanthorpe Adamellite into the surrounding metamorphic and sedimentary rock. Subsequent uplift and erosion of the New England Fold Belt has seen the majority of the surrounding sediments and metamorphic rocks eroded away, with the Stanthorpe Adamellite remaining due to its resistance to weathering.
For many millennia, Bald Rock functioned as a neutral territory where the three indigenous nations of the area – the Jukembal, Bundjalung, and Kamilaroi – found common ground. Serving as a natural boundary, the rock allowed for gatherings and trade between these nations, eliminating the need for them to traverse each other&#x27;s lands.

This regolith has created a landscape with many exposed inselbergs of granite rocks, some balancing on top of each other, or forming natural arches.
In 2019/2020, bushfires severely damaged the Bungoona walking track. The NSW Government invested $800,000 repairing and upgrading the track, including making it wheelchair-accessible. The upgrades were completed in March 2023.

Just off the main road from Tenterfield to the park is Thunderbolt&#x27;s Hideout, a set of caves and overhanging granite rocks. It was thought to have been used by bushranger Captain Thunderbolt. A little further along the same road are some historic World War II tank traps.

<text>Barakee is a national park in New South Wales, Australia, 257 km north of Sydney. It is connected to Barakee State Conservation Area.

== Description ==
The park and conservation area form an ecological corridor from the Manning River floodplain to the Great Dividing Range, linking diverse habitats. It also supports several threatened animal species.

There is a high diversity of forest ecosystems and other vegetation communities in the area. It includes significant stands of old-growth forest and rainforest habitats. The vegetation is dominated by Sydney blue gum (&quot;Eucalyptus saligna&quot;), forest red gum (&quot;Eucalyptus tereticornis&quot;), river oak (&quot;Casuarina cunninghamiana&quot;), thin-leaved stringybark (&quot;Eucalyptus eugenioides&quot;), tallowwood (&quot;Eucalyptus microcorys&quot;), grey gums (&quot;Eucalyptus punctata&quot;, &quot;Eucalyptus canaliculata&quot; and &quot;Eucalyptus biturbinata&quot;), white mahogany (&quot;Eucalyptus acmenoides&quot;), pink bloodwood (&quot;Corymbia intermedia&quot;), broad-leaved apple (&quot;Angophora subvelutina&quot;) and apple box (&quot;Eucalyptus bridgesiana&quot;).

Threatened animal species include glossy black-cockatoo (&quot;Calyptorhynchus lathami&quot;), scarlet robin (&quot;Petroica boodang&quot;), flame robin (&quot;Petroica phoenicea&quot;), eastern false pipistrelle (&quot;Falsistrellus tasmaniensis&quot;), koala (&quot;Phascolarctos cinereus&quot;) and eastern bentwing-bat (&quot;Miniopterus schreibersii oceanensis&quot;).

Barakee is remote, and therefore doesn&#x27;t have large numbers of visitors, but it provides a natural experience. Camping, swimming and fishing are possible in the park. Visitors can hike or drive four-wheel vehicles.

== Fires of 2019-2020 ==
The fires that took place in 2019/2020 left scars on some parts of the park. So many parts are closed to visitors, to give the habitat time to recover and to renew the infrastructure.

<text>The Barrington Tops National Park is a protected national park in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales, Australia. Gazetted in 1969, the park is situated between Scone, Singleton, Dungog, Gloucester and East Gresford.

The park is part of the Barrington Tops group World Heritage Site Gondwana Rainforests of Australia inscribed in 1986 and added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2007.

It is also part of the Barrington Tops and Gloucester Tops Important Bird Area.

==Environment==

===Geology===
Barrington Tops is part of the Mount Royal Range, a spur of the Great Dividing Range. Barrington Tops is a plateau between two of the large peaks in the range. The park is believed to be an extinct volcano and the mountain ranges are made up of a mixture of sedimentary rocks with a granite top. Erosion has weathered the granite and rounded granite boulders can be seen in some areas of the park. Estimates put the age of the rock at 300 to 400 million years, well before Australia separated from Gondwana.

===Climate===

The climate varies from temperate on the lower altitudes to subalpine at highest elevations. A record low of has been registered at above mean sea level. Rainfalls fluctuate between in the northwest to more than in the southeast.

===Flora===
The ecology of the national park varies from subtropical rainforests in the gullies to subalpine and alpine regions on the mountain peaks. Snow usually falls on the mountain peaks every year and occasionally snows enough to close roads. Rainfall can exceed per annum.

A large variety of plants and animals reside in the park and the steepness of the terrain ensures that they are not disturbed by humans. Plant life includes a large variety of eucalypt trees including Snow Gums, subtropical and temperate rainforest trees like Antarctic beech, tree ferns, a large variety of mosses and ferns and a wide range of edible plants such as the native raspberry, the native cherry and the lilli pilli.

===Fauna===

The remoteness and inaccessibility of a large part of the park has allowed some of the more sensitive animals to remain largely undisturbed. A large number of fauna have been catalogued in the park. Some of the more common animals include: barking and sooty owls, eastern grey kangaroos, frogs, pademelons, cockatoos, rosellas, kookaburras, bats and echidnas. It supports a globally important population of rufous scrub-birds, as well as flame robins, pale-yellow robins, paradise riflebirds, green catbirds, regent bowerbirds and Australian logrunners.

Animals such as quolls, native rodents and platypus are reclusive, but may be seen. Not all of the animals in the park are desirable; introduced species such as feral horses, deer, feral pigs, feral goats, foxes, and feral cats are planned to be removed.

==History==
The traditional owners of the area are Aboriginal Australian peoples, including the Gringai people (southern valleys), the Wonnarua people (western country), and the Worimi and Birpai people (the eastern side).

===National Park and World Heritage Area===
In 1969 the area between Mount Barrington, Mount Royal and the Gloucester Tops was declared the Barrington Tops National Park. In 1986 it was listed as a World Heritage Area and subsequently a Wilderness Area. Some of the rivers flowing through the Barrington range have been classed as wild rivers meaning they are exceptionally pure and unpolluted. The highest peak is Brumlow Top which rises to a height of .

===Aircraft crashes===
A number of aircraft have crashed in and around the Barrington Tops, Aeroplane Hill being named after one of the crashes. The altitude, frequent fog &amp; cloud, storms and cold weather (causing icing) make this area potentially hazardous to aircraft. One article refers to the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Triangle&quot;.

===Barrington Guest House===
The Barrington Guest House was built from 1925 on the upper Williams River near Barrington Tops by Norman T. McLeod, licensee of the Royal Hotel in Dungog, using timber cut and milled from the property. It stood on land consisting of of forest surrounded by National and State Parks and was officially opened in 1930 by Leader of the Country Party Earle Page. During the opening there was some 200 guests that attended.

The guest house was a popular venue for people to stay in the park, until it burned down in a fire at 11pm on 24 September 2006 due to an electrical fault. The fire was not regarded as suspicious. It was undergoing modernisation under new ownership at the time of the fire. There are plans to rebuild, but no significant process has been made, and only part of the old chimney remains on the site. The guest house has undergone many different owners in its history; Mattara Investments that traded as Barrington Guest House and bought the premises in 1976. Due to business troubles however, it was then placed into voluntary administration in 2000, after which the business was than taken over by David and Susan Eissa in February 2002. Only one more owner has been known since (according to the now defunct website); Purchased in January 2004 by Natalie Day and Tony Horley. In April 2024, the site was purchased by a group of previous guests and owners who are making it safe to enable future visitation (2025).

==Access==
Barrington Tops is a popular weekend destination from Sydney and Newcastle. Numerous walking trails and camping grounds are scattered throughout the park. The park also contains well marked and well-maintained gravel roads as well as specific 4WD tracks into less travelled areas. General sightseeing can be accomplished in a non-offroad vehicle. As well as camping facilities, the nearby towns of Gloucester and Dungog have many places to stay. The park is maintained by the NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service and rangers patrol the park daily.

Since 2014 Adelaide have played home matches at the Adelaide Oval, a 53,500-seat stadium located on the northern bank on the River Torrens in North Adelaide.

The Crows were formed in 1990 as the de facto state team representing South Australia in the AFL. They were originally owned by the South Australian National Football League (SANFL), though they gained administrative independence in 2014. They played their first season in 1991 and finished in 9th place, the highest ranking of any expansion club in the AFL in a debut year. The men&#x27;s team won both the 1997 and 1998 Grand Finals, and have appeared in 15 finals series in their 33-year history. Adelaide is the most successful team in the AFL Women&#x27;s competition, and is one of two clubs (the other being ) that have won multiple premierships; winning in 2017, 2019 and 2022 (S6). It also fields a reserves team in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL), along with the other South Australian football team in the Port Adelaide Football Club.

The men&#x27;s team is currently coached by Matthew Nicks and is captained by Jordan Dawson.

==History==

===1990s: Foundation and back-to-back triumph===
After the VFL was renamed the AFL for the 1990 season, the SANFL clubs unanimously resolved, in 1990, that a team would not be entered into the AFL until 1992. The AFL refused to accept this, and revised negotiations with individual clubs Port Adelaide and Norwood. Two months later, the Port Adelaide Football Club reached terms of agreement with the AFL to enter a team into its competition in season 1991. The other nine SANFL clubs reacted strongly and entered into litigation in an endeavour to halt Port&#x27;s bid. As the terms offered were more favourable than previously offered, talks were resumed. On 19 September 1990, the AFL approved the bid for a new South Australian club to enter into the league rather than a single existing SANFL club.

The Adelaide Crows played their first season in the AFL in 1991. Inaugural coach Graham Cornes and captain Chris McDermott led Adelaide to a respectable ninth place out of 15 in the league, with 10 wins and 12 losses and a percentage of 89.44. Adelaide&#x27;s first AFL game was against on Friday 22 March at their then home ground, Football Park. The Crows defeated the eventual premiers by a hefty 86-point margin, winning 24.11 (155) to 9.15 (69). The club reached its first finals series in the 1993 AFL season, eventually losing to Essendon in the preliminary final.

====Premiership glory in 1997 and 1998====
The year 1997 marked the entry of a second South Australian club, . The Crows finished fourth to qualify for its first finals series since 1993, and hosted fifth-placed in the First Elimination Final. In the first final ever to be played at Football Park, the Crows won 14.15 (99) to 9.12 (66). The next week, Adelaide benefited from the finals system in use at the time and hosted the higher ranked , who had finished two places above the Crows but were forced to play away due to losing the previous week to . The Crows won narrowly in a controversial match, where a clear forward 50 mark to Geelong&#x27;s Leigh Colbert during a critical stage of the third quarter was not awarded by field umpire Grant Vernon, with the game concluding with the final scores as Adelaide 11.10 (76) to Geelong&#x27;s 9.14 (68). This set up an away Preliminary Final against the at the MCG. Despite losing Coleman Medallist Tony Modra, who had kicked 84 goals for the season, to an ACL injury in the first quarter and trailing by 31 points at half time, the Crows kicked four unanswered goals in the last quarter to record a two-point victory, 12.21 (93) to 13.13 (91). Darren Jarman kicked a goal to put Adelaide in front with less than two minutes remaining, this qualified the Crows for their first AFL Grand Final, to be played against at the MCG a week later.

St Kilda, chasing just their second premiership in VFL/AFL history, were warm favourites to win the Grand Final, having come first in the minor round and won both of their finals by margins of 46 and 31 points, against an Adelaide side without Tony Modra, Mark Ricciuto and goalsneak Peter Vardy due to injury. However, the Crows again overcame a half-time deficit, kicking 14 second-half goals to win by 31 points, 19.11 (125) to 13.16 (94). Darren Jarman kicked six goals, five of which came in the last quarter, whilst utility Shane Ellen kicked a career-best five and Troy Bond kicked four. Andrew McLeod, who gathered 31 possessions across half-back and in the midfield, won the Norm Smith Medal for the best player on-field in the Grand Final. The win is arguably one of the finest moments in South Australian sporting history.

Few expected the Crows to successfully defend their premiership the following year. Adelaide often struggled in close matches during the 1998 AFL season; seven of their nine losses were by 13 points or less, compared to only three wins by corresponding margins (they finished the regular season fifth on the ladder, with a record of 13–9). The Crows were well beaten by Melbourne in the qualifying final at the MCG by 48 points, and at the time, looked far from a premiership threat. Since season 2000, a loss in the finals by a team outside the top four would result in instant elimination, but the Crows benefited from a quirk in the McIntyre finals system that was in use during the 90&#x27;s and still progressed to the second week, drawn to play a semi final against the Sydney Swans at the SCG. The Crows bounced back from their disappointing first finals loss and recorded a comprehensive upset 27-point win against the Swans in the wet, which set up a Preliminary Final rematch against the Western Bulldogs. Despite going into the match as underdogs, the Crows played some of their best football of the year to soundly beat the Dogs by 68 points - 24.17 (161) to 13.15 (93). It was a complete contrast to the thriller that took place the previous year, with Matthew Robran kicking six goals and Andrew McLeod, opposed to renowned tagger Tony Liberatore, booting seven.

Like the previous year, Adelaide went into the Grand Final as underdogs, playing against , who had won the premiership in 1996 and had won eleven consecutive matches leading up to the Grand Final. North Melbourne led by 24 points at half-time, 6.15 (51) to 4.3 (27), with only their inaccurate goalkicking keeping Adelaide in the contest. However, as they had in the previous year, Adelaide dominated the second half to win by 35 points, 15.15 (105) to 8.22 (70) - the result making Adelaide the only club during the decade of the 1990s to achieve the feat of winning back to back AFL premierships. Darren Jarman kicked five goals, while Andrew McLeod won his second successive Norm Smith Medal, an unprecedented feat. Club legend Mark Ricciuto won the Crows&#x27; Club Champion award in 1998. Following a disappointing year in 1999, premiership coach Malcolm Blight resigned from the role and the Crows entered the new millennium with two premierships under their belt.

===2000s: Finals and near misses===
The Crows next made the finals in 2001 AFL season, though they lost their opening three matches for the season. Adelaide played fifth-placed at the MCG in the First Elimination Final and were roundly defeated, 17.16 (118) to 6.14 (50). High-profile forward Darren Jarman announced his retirement after the match. Adelaide&#x27;s impressive 2002 AFL season (in which they achieved a 15–7 win–loss record) came undone at the penultimate stage, losing to Collingwood in the Preliminary Final at the MCG. Ben Hart won his second Malcolm Blight Medal in 2002, with Tyson Edwards finishing runner-up. Brett Burton led the Crows&#x27; goalkickers with 51. Hart and Mark Ricciuto were both named as All-Australians. Adelaide then exacted some revenge by defeating Collingwood in the pre-season competition in 2003, the club&#x27;s first win in that competition. The Crows&#x27; impressive 2003 season was eventually halted by the at the Gabba in the semi-finals. That season, Adelaide captain Mark Ricciuto became the first and (as of 2024) only Crow to win the Brownlow Medal for the best and fairest player in the AFL in a three-way tie with Adam Goodes and Nathan Buckley. The Crows returned to finals in 2005 and recorded a famous win in what remains the only Showdown match against rivals in the semi-finals. They then lost once more at the penultimate stage (preliminary final), to the West Coast Eagles at Subiaco Oval by 16 points. This was repeated in 2006 when they again lost to West Coast in the preliminary final, this time at home and by an even smaller margin of 10 points.

Adelaide would qualify for finals for each of the remaining seasons in the 2000s, falling short at the elimination or semi-final on each occasion. Collingwood proved to be the biggest hurdle, knocking the Crows out of the finals race successively in 2008 and 2009. Andrew McLeod and Bernie Vince won the club&#x27;s best and fairest awards in that time.

Adelaide&#x27;s finals runs in the 2000s

===2010s: Rebuilding and tragedy===
The Crows had their biggest rebrand in the club&#x27;s history on the eve of the 2010 season, shifting their logo to an entirely new design. Adelaide had a disastrous start to the 2010 season, losing their first six matches of the home and away season. They did recover to some extent in the back half of the year, finishing 11th with nine wins and thirteen losses, the first time under coach Neil Craig that the team did not make the finals. The season marked a turning point, with the likes of McLeod, Simon Goodwin and fellow stars Brett Burton, Tyson Edwards and Trent Hentschel all announcing their retirements during the season. Long-term defender and club stalwart Nathan Bock announced he was leaving the club to join new side . These changes led to a disastrous 2011 campaign, which became the worst season in the club&#x27;s history to that point. After a 103-point loss to fading champions , the club&#x27;s longest-serving coach Neil Craig stepped down, handing the reins to assistant coach and former premiership captain Mark Bickley as caretaker for the remainder of the season.

Under Bickley the club won three of their next four games, but lost their final two to and , finishing in 14th place with 7 wins and 15 losses. Scott Thompson won the Malcolm Blight Medal (best and fairest award) for the season. New coach Brenton Sanderson began his era at the club with a pre-season premiership in 2012 and followed up that success with an above-expectations regular season; the Crows finishing 17-5 and never once losing consecutive matches. Adelaide eventually qualified to face minor premiers at the MCG in the First Preliminary Final. Hawthorn led for most of the match and despite Adelaide taking the lead with five minutes remaining, the Hawks responded to win the match by five points, in yet another heartbreaking finals series loss for the Crows. Adelaide would then fall down the ladder in the following 2013 and 2014 seasons, narrowly missing the top 8 on both occasions. Failing to reach the finals led to Sanderson being sacked at the end of the 2014 season. The club would move its home matches to the newly redeveloped Adelaide Oval at the start of the 2014 season, though to this day the Crows retain their training and administrative headquarters at their old home stadium, Football Park.

====2012: Scandal and Investigation====
At the end of 2012, it was revealed that Adelaide had been found guilty of breaching the salary cap and tampering with the draft. As a sign of cooperation with the AFL, Adelaide forfeited themselves from the first two rounds of the 2012 draft. At a hearing at AFL House in Melbourne, both the Adelaide Crows and current CEO at the time, Steven Trigg, were fined $300,000 and $50,000 respectively. The Adelaide Football Club were also suspended from participating in the first two rounds of the 2013 draft. It&#x27;s widely accepted to be the league&#x27;s biggest salary cap and list management scandal since Carlton in 2002.

====2014: Death of Dean Bailey, transfer of SANFL licence====
In March 2014, over one week prior to the commencement of the new season, assistant coach Dean Bailey died following a short battle with lung cancer.

On the eve of the new season, the South Australian Football Commission announced it had struck a deal with the Adelaide Football Club which required the SANFL to transfer its ownership of the Crows&#x27; licence to the club, in exchange for payments totalling $11.326 million between 2013 and 2028. The arrangement marked the first time the Adelaide Football Club had independent control of its own administration and came in conjunction with measures designed to solidify the SANFL&#x27;s control of game development and the sport in South Australia.

====2015: Death of Phil Walsh====
The 2015 season started incredibly successfully for the Adelaide Football Club with a 77-point win over reigning preliminary finalists . Newly appointed coach Phil Walsh oversaw a rapidly improving team that became known for their skilled ball use and ability to grind out wins. During the season, Adelaide was cleared of any wrongdoing by the AFL in the Eddie Betts affair, which became newsworthy following an allegation that Betts&#x27;s transfer to the Crows from had been illegally signed and approved as much as 18 months prior to his move.
Tragically, on 3 July, two days prior to Adelaide&#x27;s then-scheduled round 14 match against , coach Phil Walsh was stabbed to death by his son at the age of 55 in his Somerton Park home. His son Cy Walsh would later be found not guilty of murder due to mental incompetence and placed under a lifetime psychiatric supervision licence, ordering that he be detained indefinitely in a secure psychiatric facility. The tragedy was followed by an outpouring of sympathy and tributes from the club&#x27;s fans and the wider AFL community. The match against the Cats was cancelled, with both teams receiving two premiership points each. Adelaide&#x27;s SANFL team&#x27;s match against , scheduled for the next day, was postponed until later in the season.

On 6 July, assistant coach Scott Camporeale was appointed interim coach for the remainder of the season, while premiership coach John Worsfold was hired as coaching director to support Camporeale. Inspiringly, the team rebounded to win six of their next seven games and qualify for the 2015 finals series, where they defeated the Western Bulldogs by seven points in a thrilling elimination final at the MCG. Their season ended when they lost to eventual premiers the next week.

====2016–2019: Don Pyke era====
Star midfielder for many years Patrick Dangerfield left the club at the end of the 2015 season (a season in which he won the club&#x27;s best and fairest) and Don Pyke, a former premiership player and assistant coach with who had also been an assistant coach at Adelaide from 2005 to 2006, was appointed Adelaide&#x27;s senior coach for at least three years. Adelaide was widely tipped to slide out of the finals in 2016 but the Crows proved to be one of the successes of the season, comfortably qualifying for a home elimination final and defeating by 62 points, before being eliminated the next week by eventual beaten grand finalists, in the semi-finals. The club had a dominant 2017 season, winning their opening six games and never falling below second place for the entire season. Adelaide claimed their second McClelland Trophy as minor premiers. The Adelaide Crows entered the 2017 finals series as favourites for the premiership; they defeated and by 36 and 61 points respectively to qualify for the Grand Final, their first since 1998, where they faced . Despite starting as rampaging hot favourites, the Crows lost the match by 48 points and finished runners-up for the first time in their history.

The club struggled to replicate its 2017 form in the 2018 AFL season. Prior to the season, Adelaide players went on a controversial pre-season camp that led to a decline in morale among the club&#x27;s players. Adelaide struggled with injuries during the year, including Captain Taylor Walker, Rory Sloane, Brad Crouch, Tom Lynch, Rory Laird, and Richard Douglas. Combined with the loss of Cameron and Lever, the Crows struggled throughout the year but held on to win twelve games, including against 2017 Premiers and soon-to-be 2018 Premiers West Coast. The club finished 12th on the ladder with 12 wins, 10 losses, and a percentage of 104.1, and below crosstown rivals Port Adelaide who finished 10th, but with 3.5 more percentage points. This put Adelaide out of the finals for the first time since 2014. One highlight towards the end of the year was Rory Sloane who, despite rumours of a trade home to Victoria, signed a five-year contract and went on to play out his time as a one-club player.

There were lofty aspirations going into 2019, with many expecting them to play finals or even in the premiership. Despite fewer injuries, the club failed to meet these lofty expectations of finals, finishing 11th with 10 wins, 12 losses, and 100.9 percentage points. There was much media coverage given to the team throughout the season, with concerns raised about player retention and the coaching staff, especially with players like Bryce Gibbs, Josh Jenkins, and Eddie Betts dropped on and off throughout the season due to issues of form. Following the end of their season, the club began an external review of their football operations, with many musing about the future of players and coaching staff. Prior to the conclusion of the review, co-captain Taylor Walker resigned his captaincy after four years to focus on his football and family. A week later, Coach Don Pyke stepped down, a decision unrelated to the reviews that were occurring.

=====2018 Adelaide Crows pre-season camp=====

The 2018 Adelaide Crows pre-season camp was a summer camp undertaken by players of the Adelaide Football Club from 29 January to 2 February in the lead-up to the 2018 AFL season.
In Eddie Betts&#x27; biography, he released details of what happened at the camp. These revelations caused many to question what had been said to that point regarding the camp.
Following the release of Eddie Betts biography, Josh Jenkins released a statement with further details from the camp. His opposition to aspects of the camp led to him being ostracised and was the reason he left the club.

===2020–present: Matthew Nicks era===
====2020–2021: COVID-affected seasons====
Former Port Adelaide and Greater Western Sydney assistant coach Matthew Nicks was appointed as Adelaide&#x27;s senior coach on 15 October 2019, replacing the outgoing Pyke. Under new coach Nicks, the Crows lost the first 13 matches of the coronavirus-affected 2020 AFL season and ultimately claimed their first wooden spoon in club history. However, the Crows&#x27; disastrous season did end with some optimism, as the Crows broke the drought in round 15 against and won three matches in a row towards the season&#x27;s conclusion. The Crows received their highest-ever draft pick at the 2020 AFL draft, used to draft Riley Thilthorpe.

The Crows won their first game of the 2021 AFL season, beating the reigning Grand Finalists Geelong in an upset victory. The Crows improved slightly over their disastrous 2020 campaign, losing only one of their first four games. Walker was banned from the AFL for six games between the 2021 and 2022 AFL seasons due to racist comments directed towards Robbie Young of during a SANFL match. After requesting a move home to South Australia and subsequently nominating the Crows, high-value Sydney wingman Jordan Dawson was traded to Adelaide in the 2021 trade period. The trade would prove influential in Adelaide&#x27;s rise out of the bottom four in 2022.

====2022–present: Post-COVID era====

The Crows hosted the first-ever Friday night Showdown in Round 3, and claimed one of their best-ever wins via an after-the-siren bending kick from the recruit Dawson, who received best-on-ground honours. Captain Rory Sloane ruptured his ACL in round 5. In his absence, the role of captain rotated between Reilly O&#x27;Brien, Ben Keays, Brodie Smith, and Tom Doedee for the remainder of the season. Adelaide traded in Izak Rankine at a high price, leaving them no first-round draft picks in the 2022 AFL draft until they matched the bid for Max Michalanney, son of Jim as the club&#x27;s first father–son pick.

The Crows headlined the first-ever Gather Round, as they had a return to form, defeating multiple top-eight teams. Some controversial finishes, including one in round 23 against , when a Ben Keays goal was mistakenly disallowed, cost the Crows their first AFL finals series in seven years. Adelaide finished 2023 in 10th on the ladder, their best position since 2017, in part due to the leadership of their new captain Jordan Dawson. Despite high expectations, 2024 was another disappointing year for the club, with a lack of on-field performance resulting in questions being raised around Nicks&#x27; coaching, particularly amid the choice to drop young forward Josh Rachele.

==Club symbols==

===Club guernsey===

Adelaide currently has three guernsey designs which are used in different matches throughout the season. The club&#x27;s guernseys are currently supplied by Irish sportswear company O&#x27;Neills.

====Present====
The home guernsey features navy blue, red and gold hoops. It is worn at all matches designated as home games for the club as well as in selected away games (currently only Geelong, Port Adelaide, Western Bulldogs, and Sydney). The jumper is worn with navy shorts at all home and away games, except for away Showdowns, where it is paired with white shorts. It has had only minor variations through its history since debuting with the club in 1991, including adding a white outline to the numbers from 1996 to 2020 which has now been removed since the start of the 2021 season, and the removal of yellow cuffs and addition of navy blue panels down the sides (due to manufacturers template design) in 2006. In 2009 the yellow cuffs and full hoops returned. In 2010 the hoops were cut off again at the sides. For 2016, the club removed the side panels, returning to the full hoops of the original design. The original base design/idea has never changed in the club&#x27;s 30-year history.

Adelaide&#x27;s clash guernseys have historically used red or yellow bases, so that it will not clash with other team&#x27;s guernseys in cases where the blue-based home guernsey is not appropriate. 2025&#x27;s clash guernsey is predominantly red with singular yellow and blue stripes across the middle. Paired with white shorts, the clash guernsey features the club&#x27;s new logo across the chest with a yellow outline.

The club&#x27;s Indigenous guernsey has been a rotating design since it was first introduced in during the 2013 season vs. North Melbourne. The first iteration of the Adelaide Indigenous guernsey was a simple swap from Navy to Black, representing the colours in the Australian Aboriginal flag. Since 2014 however, they guernsey has featured art on a navy base from a wide number of indigenous artists and past players, such as Andrew McLeod and Ben Davis. The 2023 edition of these guernseys was the first to be shared between the women&#x27;s and the men&#x27;s teams. The most recent of these was designed by Izak Rankine and his cousin Harley Hall, celebrating their shared Ngarrindjeri heritage. It was revealed in March 2024.

The club wore their first commemorative ANZAC guernsey in 2024. The guernsey features the chevrons of the sergeant rank insignia of the Australian Army, and a soldier with a bugle. It marks a new design trend not before seen in Adelaide&#x27;s guernseys, with chevrons used rather than the traditional hoops, and the use of a gradient. The guernsey was worn in round 7 against . The proceeds of the auctioned player-issue guernseys will be donated to the RSL.

====Past====
In previous seasons, the Crows have had variations of alternate guernseys.

The club briefly used an alternate design in the pre-season competition. It was still in the club colours, but featured the club logo prominently on the front and continuing over onto the back. This design would go on to inspire multiple clash guernseys and the Gather Round guernsey.

The away guernsey was originally intended for use in all matches designated as away games, except finals. The design had changed several times over the years since it was first used in 1999. From 2006 the red was removed from the top of the guernsey, moving it closer to the home guernsey. Its usage had waned since the introduction of the &quot;clash&quot; guernsey, to the point where it was only used twice in 2007, against the Western Bulldogs in round 2 and Collingwood in round 22. In a few away matches that year, the club also continued to use the traditional &quot;home&quot; guernsey, something which had rarely been done since the away strip was introduced. In response to this, a new away guernsey was introduced in 2008 featuring more red and yellow with a flying crow on the front – similar in design to the mid-90s pre-season jumper.

The clash guernsey was first introduced for season 2006 and was radically different from the &quot;home&quot; and &quot;away&quot; designs at the time. It was worn at all away games where the AFL deemed there to be a clash with the home team&#x27;s guernsey design. Initially, the only clubs officially on the &quot;clash list&quot; were Carlton, Essendon, Fremantle, Melbourne and Richmond. Despite this, the AFL forced the club to wear it against other teams, such as Hawthorn and St Kilda in 2007, West Coast in 2008 and the Brisbane Lions in 2008 and 2009. Eventually, the clash jumper was required to be worn in nearly all away games.

The first clash guernsey was red, and was worn from 2006 to 2009. The club first adopted a white clash guernsey in 2010. It featured the club logo on the front with stylised curves in club colours on the front and back with navy stripes down the sides. The design continued to be changed a number of times over the years, but remained predominantly white until the end of the 2020 season.

There were yellow and red clash guernseys for 2021, before solely moving to the red guernsey for 2022 and 2023. These designs were similar to the alternative guernsey used from 2016 to 2017.
In 2024, Adelaide wore a retro-style design for their clash guernsey. It features the flying crow found on the club&#x27;s old logo. The crow is in blue, the above background yellow and the below background red. The design derives from the 1996 preseason design, also found in the club&#x27;s away guernsey from 2008 to 2009. A key factor behind this change is the popularity for the club&#x27;s Gather Round guernsey, which debuted in 2023 and featured the same crow design in a &quot;stealth&quot; style.

The alternative guernsey, worn in 2016 and 2017 was the same design as the white clash guernsey of the time, but with a gold base. It was worn in away games in which it provided a greater contrast with the home team than either the home or white clash guernseys. Those teams were North Melbourne, Carlton, Fremantle and Western Bulldogs football clubs. It was always worn with white shorts.

During the mid-2000s, the Crows adopted three different guernsey designs to wear during the AFL&#x27;s Heritage Round. The 2004 iteration featured the tri-colour home guernsey but with the AFC crest on the chest and removal of white stroke to the numbers. All heritage guernseys featured each player&#x27;s name and debut number above the manufacturer&#x27;s jock tag. Controversially during the 2005 heritage round, the Crows wore an adaptation of a 1930s South Australian state guernsey, with the AFC monogram replacing the SA monogram, which prompted outrage from Port Adelaide coach Mark Williams. The club returned to a similar home design for the 2006 and 2007 Heritage Rounds, with the left panel of the guernsey featuring the colours of all SANFL clubs, before the Heritage Round was scrapped by the AFL.

=== Club song ===

The club song of the Adelaide Football Club is &quot;The Pride of South Australia&quot;, and is sung to the tune of US Marines Hymn. The lyrics to &quot;The Pride of South Australia&quot; were written by the inaugural CEO Bill Sanders.

The first club song, and the song used in the club&#x27;s inaugural AFL game and victory against Hawthorn, was &quot;Here We Go Camry Crows&quot;.

===Headquarters and training facilities===
Since inception in late 1990, Adelaide&#x27;s training and administrative facilities have been located at Football Park in West Lakes. The club held their first training session at the ground on 29 October 1990. Initially the club&#x27;s offices were restricted to small space under the SANFL members&#x27; grandstand, before being moved to a new brick building at the southern end of the stadium in 1992. Between 1993 and 1995 a $2.3 million player and training facility was constructed behind the eastern grandstands, featuring several sports training facilities described at the time as “the best in the league”. Additional offices were constructed at the northern end of the ground, and a $21 million renovation was concluded in 2009, which featured a 2500sq metre “Shed” for gatherings of fans and members, and upgrades to the indoor training and administrative facilities. When Football Park stopped hosting premiership matches at the end of the 2013 season, the grandstands were progressively torn down and the club&#x27;s game-day facilities were merged with the administration offices, whilst the general public were granted access to the oval outside of Crows&#x27; training sessions.

In 2024, following prolonged negotiations with the local council and SANFL, the Adelaide Football Club announced it would move its training and administrative headquarters to an upgraded Thebarton Oval, which will feature a 150m, two-storey wrap-around building and upgraded grandstands and new facilities for the club&#x27;s AFL, AFLW and SANFL teams.

===AFL Women&#x27;s team===

The Adelaide AFLW team is the club&#x27;s women&#x27;s team in the AFL Women&#x27;s league. A founding member of the AFLW, the football club launched a bid to enter a team in the 2017 AFL Women&#x27;s season in April 2016. The bid was constructed in partnership with AFL Northern Territory, with the club to share resources and facilities between its Adelaide base and AFLNT&#x27;s Darwin location. The bid became a success in June of that year when the league announced they had been awarded one of eight inaugural licences.

Under inaugural coach Bec Goddard, the team won the first ever AFLW premiership in 2017. The season was also a highlight for individual success, with co-captain Erin Phillips winning the league most valuable player and best on ground in the grand final. Missing the finals in 2018, Goddard quit as coach and was replaced by Matthew Clarke for the 2019 season. Winning six out of the seven home-and-away games, the club returned to finals and won its second premiership with a 45-point win against . Erin Phillips repeated her individual success by winning the league MVP for the second time and the grand final best on ground despite leaving the ground injured in the third quarter. It was announced in August 2019 that the partnership between Adelaide and AFLNT would not continue. During the COVID-19-interrupted 2020 season, the Crows slumped to only two wins and failed to reach the finals. The club quickly rose back up the following year and won seven of nine home-and-away matches, and they claimed the minor premiership for the 2021 season before going down to Brisbane by 18 points in the 2021 grand final. Adelaide bounced back the next year to win the 2022 AFL Women&#x27;s season 6 Grand Final by 13 points, earning their third premiership, the most of any club in the league.

In 2022, AFL rivals were introduced into the women&#x27;s competition. The two teams met in the first-ever AFLW Showdown on the 30th of September. The occasion drew in a crowd of 20,652 at Adelaide Oval, which was the highest attendance for any game in 2022 season 7. Following their historic back-to-back premierships, Adelaide had consecutive preliminary final exits in season 7 and 2023, with loses to eventual runners-up and respectively. Despite this, Adelaide finished 1st in the 2023 home-and-away season, becoming the first team to achieve this on four occasions. Ebony Marinoff and Sarah Allen became the club&#x27;s new co-captains in 2024. Another top-four finish ended in a bittersweet manner, as the Crows lost to both eventual grand finalists and , but Marinoff was crowned the league&#x27;s best and fairest.

===SANFL team===

The Adelaide Crows were granted a license to field a stand-alone reserves men&#x27;s team in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) in 2014. Prior to this date AFL-listed players at the club were drafted to SANFL clubs, and would play for them when not selected for the AFL team. A fairly unsuccessful history thus far, the Crows finished last in 2018 but have appeared in four preliminary finals. Ruckman Kieran Strachan has won the most best and fairest awards, with three to his name.

==Rivalries==

Adelaide has a fierce rivalry with fellow South Australian AFL team Port Adelaide. Matches between the two teams are known as the Showdown. The Showdown rivalry significantly draws upon the bitter, winner take all, competition for the two South Australian licences to join the AFL in the 1980s and early 1990s. The Showdown is often considered the best, and most bitter, in the Australian Football League with Malcolm Blight, Australian Football Hall of Fame Legend, stating in 2009 that &quot;there is no doubt it is the greatest rivalry in football&quot;.

==Membership base and sponsorship==
In 2006, the club made history becoming the first club in VFL/AFL history to have more than 50,000 members (with 50,138). They broke that record in 2007, signing up 50,146 members after only round one of the season. The club failed to continue this record run and subsequently signed 48,720 members in 2008, barely maintaining their pole position, before slipping to 45,515 in 2010; however, the trend reversed and later breached all-time highs in 2014 when they signed 54,249, although five other clubs had surpassed their membership base by this point, with Collingwood leading with nearly 80,000 members by this point. Adelaide&#x27;s membership peaked for the 2019 season with 64,437, and their 2022 membership was 63,009.

The club has enjoyed a long-standing partnership with Toyota since its inception, leading the club to be known in promotional materials as the &quot;Camry Crows&quot;.

Two-time Grand Slam tennis champion Lleyton Hewitt was made the club&#x27;s number-one ticket holder in December 2002. International pop singer Guy Sebastian became the number-one ticket holder in April 2024. Former federal politician Kate Ellis is the number-one female ticket holder, while Greg Champion, a musician and radio broadcaster, is the Melbourne number-one ticket holder. Australian golfer Adam Scott is also an honorary member of the club.

===&quot;Team of the Decade&quot;===
While some sides named their &quot;Team of the Century&quot; to coincide with the AFL centenary celebrations in 1996, Adelaide only joined the league in 1991, and so later on named their &quot;Team of the Decade&quot;, covering the period from 1991 to 2000. As well as earning selection in the team, Mark Ricciuto was named &#x27;Player of the Decade&#x27; and Mark Bickley &#x27;Team Man of the Decade.&#x27;

<text>Beowa National Park, formerly Ben Boyd National Park, is a national park in New South Wales, Australia, south of Sydney. It was established in 1971 and officially renamed in 2022 owing to its previous namesake&#x27;s connection with blackbirding. &quot;Beowa&quot; means &quot;orca&quot;, an animal of significance to the traditional owners, the Thaua people.

The park forms part of the Ulladulla to Merimbula Important Bird Area.

==History==
The park was established in 1971 covering and was originally named after Benjamin Boyd. Boyd was a wealthy pastoralist and businessman in the 1840s, with interests in shipping (including whaling), based on the South Coast of NSW. At the time, the area was part of the District of Port Phillip and Boyd was elected to the NSW Legislative Council for the electoral district of Port Phillip. He was the first in Australia to engage in blackbirding, a practice akin to slavery, when a ship he had commissioned brought 65 Melanesian labourers to Boyd Town in 1847. 

Boyd commissioned the construction of a sandstone tower overlooking the entrance to the harbour of Twofold Bay to alert whaling crews of the approach of their prey. The tower was never completed. 

In the wake of the George Floyd protests around the world and in Australia and the Black Lives Matter movement gaining pace in mid-2020, calls for the national park to be renamed were renewed. Matt Kean, the NSW Environment Minister, promised to seek a briefing about renaming the park and then to consult with local elders and the community. In November 2021, Kean announced Ben Boyd National Park would be renamed Beowa Natural Park, after consultations with more than 60 representatives from Aboriginal and South Sea Islander communities. In September 2022 it was officially renamed, under new environment minister James Griffin. On 11 November 2023, Thaua and South Sea Islander elders conducted a ceremony together to mark the park&#x27;s name change. The name &quot;Beowa&quot; had been selected in honour of the orca, which is significant to the Thaua people. According to their mythology, their ancestors are orcas, and when one of them dies they are reincarnated as an orca.

The park has been expanded from its original to cover over time.

==Description==
The park consists of two sections, on either side of Twofold Bay and the town of Eden. The smaller northern section is bounded on its western border by the Princes Highway. The geology of this section is mainly sedimentary rock (ironstone and clay) laid down in the Paleogene, with some quartzite outcrops. The main attraction for tourists is the Pinnacles, a multicoloured erosion gully with white sands overlaid by rusty red clay. The southern section coastline is metamorphic and Devonian in age, with some heavily folded sections at Red Point, near Boyd&#x27;s tower.

The park is fairly flat, with none of the northern section exceeding 100 metres (300 ft) in elevation, and the southern section not much higher; the tallest peak is Haycock Hill at 252 metres (827 ft). The region is particularly windy, dry and cold, and the headlands are covered in a low ground-hugging heathland community of plants. Further inland, the heath is replaced by open eucalypt woodland, which makes up most of the park&#x27;s habitat. The two dominant tree species are silvertop ash (&quot;Eucalyptus sieberi&quot;) and red bloodwood (&quot;Corymbia gummifera&quot;). There are also scattered pockets of rainforest in gullies and protected areas, with species such as the scentless rosewood (&quot;Synoum glandulosum&quot;) and smooth mock-olive (&quot;Notelaea venosa&quot;).

==Flora and fauna ==
The park forms part of the Ulladulla to Merimbula Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for swift parrots. It was recorded in 1996 that 212 species of bird had been recorded in the park, with the heathlands being home to the eastern ground parrot and endangered eastern bristlebird, while the little tern breeds in the sand dunes and beaches. At the time, the tern was threatened by recreational four-wheel driving. 

Fifty species of mammal had been recorded by 2010. Pests recorded include cats and foxes, occasional feral dogs, and rabbits. Bitou bush (&quot;Chrysanthemoides monilifera&quot;) was a problem weed north of the Pambula River.

<text>Biamanga National Park is a protected area in New South Wales, Australia, south of Sydney and north of Bega. The park forms part of the Ulladulla to Merimbula Important Bird Area because of its importance for swift parrots.

Its name derives from Yuin elder Biamanga, aka &quot;King Jack Mumbulla&quot;, after whom Mumbulla Mountain was also named. It is an important Aboriginal site for the Yuin people and a prominent landmark that can be seen from across the Bega Valley, also known as Biamanga. Proclaimed in 1994 and extended in 1997, the park covers . It is seen by the traditional owners as &quot;part of a single cultural landscape&quot; with the Gulaga National Park, and also has cultural links to Umbarra (Merriman Island), Barunguba (Montague Island), and Dithol (Pigeon House Mountain).

In November 2021 Mumballa Mountain was ascribed the dual name of Biamanga.

==Geology==
The mountain is the remnants an ancient shield volcano, and granite rock formations and boulders are visible along the course of Mumbulla Creek.

==History==
The park lies in the lands of one of the Yuin peoples, who have inhabited the area for thousands of years.

===20th century===
Extensive logging was taking place in the area up until the 1970s, and in 1967 some of the rock was blasted with dynamite in the interests of improving television reception, and a television transmitter tower for WIN-4 was built on the mountain. After concerns had been raised by local people, the NSW Government set up an advisory committee in 1977 to investigate the woodchipping industry and in the same year 1977 Guboo Ted Thomas, a Yuin elder, led a protest against the destruction of the forest on Mumbulla Mountain. On 15 July 1980, the New South Wales Government declared an area of around an &quot;Aboriginal place&quot; and a &quot;Protected Archaeological Area&quot; under the &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974&quot; (NSW).

The park was proclaimed in 1994 and extended in 1997.

===21st century===
Further protests against logging activities took place in 2010.

On 30 November 2021 Mumballa Mountain was ascribed the dual name of Biamanga.

==Description==
The park covers . It is seen by the traditional owners as &quot;part of a single cultural landscape&quot; with the Gulaga National Park.

==Flora and fauna==
There are monkey gums and ribbon gum along the creeks, and the park is home to chef&#x27;s cap correa, an endangered species.

The park forms part of the Ulladulla to Merimbula Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for swift parrots. Azure kingfishers and superb fairywrens abound in the park.

==Management==

Biamanga has been jointly managed by the traditional owners and the National Parks and Wildlife Service NSW since 2006. The traditional custodians are represented by two Local Aboriginal Land Councils, the Merrimans and Bega LALCs, which own the title to the land and lease it back to the New South Wales Government for use as a national park.

==Aboriginal significance and sites==
The mountain and surrounds have important cultural links to Umbarra (Merriman Island), Barunguba (Montague Island), and Dithol (Pigeon House Mountain). The mountain is of particular significance to the people of Wallaga Lake.

The park contains important Aboriginal sites, in particular Biamanga, also known as Mumbulla Mountain, which is part a large ceremonial and cultural track on the South Coast of New South Wales that includes other Aboriginal sacred sites of particular importance to the Yuin peoples. The mountain was named after Yuin leader King Jack Mumbulla, aka Jack Mumbler, whose &quot;tribal&quot; name was Biamanga. King Jack would spend time communing with the ancestor spirits on the highest peak of the mountain and send smoke signals for his people to see. Initiation ceremonies were held by Yuin people at various spots on the mountain, with the last recorded one held there in 1918. It has been described as a &quot;men&#x27;s law mountain&quot;.

Independent evidence of the sacredness of the site was provided in 1964 by linguist Luise Hercus and by musician and linguist Janet Mathews, but only made publicly available in the late 1970s; as well as by notes made much earlier by Alfred William Howitt, an ethnologist who attended a Yuin initiation ceremony in 1883.

The Biamanga protest site is of additional significance both to Yuin and to all other Indigenous Australians, &quot;as a representation of embodying the Australian Aboriginal campaign for land rights and Aboriginal self-determination.

<text>Biriwal Bulga National Park is an Australian national park in New South Wales. It is approximately 45 km north west of Taree and 60 km west of Port Macquarie on the Bulga Plateau. 

The national park contains biodiverse ecosystems as well as culturally significant Indigenous Australian sites. The residents of the park range from animals to trees and bushes. The animals reside in an escarpment terrain. The park&#x27;s soil varies in depth depending on the slope. There is a higher than average amount of annual rainfall which attributes to the types of native plants found. 

There are different conservation and management plans in place to maintain the natural and cultural heritage of the park whilst also providing research opportunities for visitors. The plans are set out and authorised by NSW National Parks and Wildlife Services. Some plans include conservation regions for koalas and plants, limiting the spread and influence of pests and prevention of potential bushfires.

== Etymology and indigenous heritage ==
The name Biriwal Bulga originates from the Indigenous Birpai or Biripi people who have resided in the area for over 15,000 years. The Indigenous Australians in the local neighbourhood speak the Birpai language. The language spoken by the tribes surrounding the Birpai people is Gadjang.

Campsites and artifacts found within the park indicate the habitation of Indigenous Australians within the area. Truyard Pty. Ltd estimated that originally anywhere from 800 to 1000 Indigenous Australians inhabited in the national park and surrounding regions. The people were dispersed throughout the land in smaller clan groups, with the most prominent being the Winmurra people.

== History ==
Exploration occurred initially in the surrounding areas of Biriwal Bulga in the 1800s after European settlement. It wasn&#x27;t until 1982 when settlers began making discoveries within the park. The date of the first discoveries, mark Biriwal Bulga National Park as one of the latest National Parks to be discovered in the Port Macquarie region. Originally the park was a part of the 

In the early 1900s, Bulga State Forest Area was predominantly utilised for timber harvesting and logging operations. This resulted in the implementation of a pine plantation within the National Park. In 1990, the State government placed a moratorium on further harvesting to ensure survival of the ecosystem. This resulted in the area shifting from Bulga State Forest Area to a conservation national park known today as Biriwal Bulga.

== Region description ==
Biriwal Bulga is a 5813-hectare national park on the northern edge of the Bulga plateau. It ranges in elevation from 130m to 670m. The landform is predominantly dissected foothills, which contribute to its elevation. The most common rocks are mudstone and shale. Its average rainfall during the year ranges from 1300-1600mm. If there is vegetation cover over the land, the rainfall can potentially cause erosion of soil.

The park has few visitors due to its remote location and lack of accessibility for two-wheel drive cars and bike tracks. There are no facilities or walking trails within the national park. The nearest recreational facilities are at Tapin Tops National Park and Ellenborough Falls at Elands.

=== Weelah Nature Reserve ===
Weelah Nature Reserve is situated in the south-east of Biriwal Bulga National Park, covering an area of 37 ha. It contains one of the few rainforest remnants on the Bulga Plateau.

== Biology and ecology ==

=== Fauna ===

Seventy-four fauna species have been recorded in the area. Amongst these seventy-four species; according to NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service,“the following are recorded as vulnerable and at risk of becoming endangered: powerful owl, glossy black cockatoo, fruit doves, spotted-tailed quoll, brush-tailed phascogale, yellow-bellied glider, koala, long-nosed potoroo, large bent-wing bat”. The most common are koalas. There different sub-species of koalas which interact with the natural flora forming the ecosystem within the park. These sub-species often roam and move from neighbouring regions into the park. An estimated 500-1000 individual koalas are recorded throughout the Biriwal Bulga region.

=== Flora ===
Sixteen types of plants have been recorded within Biriwal Bulga National Park. The predominant plants are dry sclerophyll forests. During its early discovery, the park was subject to selective logging for businesses due to its dense forests. The logging caused forest destruction and disturb the natural ecosystem of the park.

The 1950s brought an end to all logging in the parkand since, the majority of forest has been restored. The Central Eastern Rainforest Reserves of Australia (CERRA) World Heritage Area has identified the park as a potential addition to its list as a development listing due to its undisturbed and intact rainforest. As of 2004, there were no recorded threatened plant species. &quot;Plectranthus suaveolens&quot; is listed as the only rare plant found. The plants listed as endangered by the NSW Wildlife Services are vine &quot;(Cynanchum elegans)&quot; and ground orchid &quot; (Diuris flavescens)&quot;&quot;.&quot;

=== Catchment ===
Biriwal Bulga National Park drains the majority of its rainfall into surrounding creeks which eventually lead to the Hastings River. The main nearby body of water is the Doyles River, which is approximately 6 km in length. This is found on the south-eastern border of the park. Inside the park are two catchments of water, Green Gully Creek and Big Creek. The water that leaves the park supplies stock on some downstream farms and partially supplies Port Macquarie.

== Environmental threats ==

=== Pests ===
Biriwal Bulga national park contains different animals, some of which are considered pests and disturb the natural ecosystem of the park. The pests sighted within the area are wild dogs, foxes, pigs and cats. The most prevalent danger are wild dogs, in particular, dingoes. Dingoes pose threats to the native koala population within the national park. Their speed allows them to track and hunt koalas that have left their trees. Foxes and pigs are also a concern for the park&#x27;s natural catchment. The pests’ movement throughout the park can cause damage to the soil. This can lead to increase in erosion which cause dirt to be run-off along with the water to the park&#x27;s neighbouring catchments.

In addition to animal pests, there are also plants and weeds which threaten to damage the habitat. In 1968–1969, a pine plantation plot was established as a trial for future pine plantation programs on the plateau. These pine trees have started to disperse to the surrounding areas outside their original allocation. This can cause problems if left uncontrolled as it damages the natural ecosystem of the park. There are also a number of pest plants which have invaded into the park from the neighbouring Yarras Mountain Trail. The most common of which is known as the lantana.

=== Fires ===
Due to the areas densely covered forest, the park is susceptible to fires. These fire pose as a threat to the wet sclerophyll communities which are abundant in the park. The fires have the capability to burn the rainforest and threaten the biodiversity within the park if they occur regularly. The main type fire is vegetation fire, most commonly known as bushfire.

Biriwal Bulga National Park was one of the areas affected by the 2019-2020 bushfire season in Australia. The fire burned during the periods of mid-December to mid-January. The torrential rain and large thunderstorms helped firefighters to contain the spread throughout the park.

=== Bacteria ===
Within the National Park, there are some bacteria that pose potential problems to the wildlife which inhabit it. A bacterium pathogen dangerous to the wildlife, in particular koalas is: Chlamydia pecorum. This pathogen is an infectious disease which harms koalas and potentially could cause fatality. It is dangerous due to the ease of which it spreads from animals to animals. As koalas, move regularly from neighbouring regions into the national park, the spread of this disease is apparent in the park. There are management plans in place to restrict the influence of bacteria on the koala population within the park.

== Management ==
Biriwal Bulga National Park is recognised as a significantly cultural land to Indigenous Australians. Any discussion in plans of conservation must be directly consulted with a member of the Biripi people The Biripi people must be involved in negotiations of plans in order to maintain the Aboriginal heritage within the park. Currently there are nine recognised sites in Biriwal Bulga that are significant to the local Indigenous population. A further two potential significant sites are being investigated with the help of the Indigenous community around Biriwal Bulga.

The issues of pests within the park has been identified by the NPWS Mid-North Coast regional pest management. They have included strategies such as preparing a mapping of areas within the park that display high activities of pest animals and plants. This allows for wildlife services to control the growth of pests, ensuring that they are kept only within those area. The maps allow for services to plan for conservation sites and ensure that native species have minimal interactions with pests. There is a focus on park services to help control the pines surrounding the plantation area. This is to ensure the prevention of weed spreading into the natural habitat.

Biriwal Bulga is recognised as a conservation site for koalas. The terrain and environment surrounding the park provide stability for steady growth of the koala population. The national park&#x27;s lack of human visitors allows for the koalas to live peacefully and undisturbed. Research and surveys are suggested to be conducted to ensure that the growth of koalas is being monitored. This is to ensure that koalas are not at risk of the potential bacteria that could cause a decrease in population.

Biriwal Bulga&#x27;s dense forest are a concern for the bushfire seasons which occur in Australia. To preserve the national park&#x27;s habitat, back-burning is a method that prevents fires from destroying the ecosystem. The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Services attempts to establish strong communication with the local Rural Fire Services to ensure a fire free interval of land is maintained every 10 to 15 years.

To implement all the management plans mentioned above, easier access into the national park is required. The NSW wildlife service&#x27;s plan to negotiate with relevant neighbours of the park for the development of safety tracks to ensure for easier access into the park. If this occurs, the park wishes to establish guidelines to ensure that visitors will not disturb the local ecosystem.

NSW wildlife service&#x27;s plans to promote Biriwal Bulga as a remote location that offers visitors the experience to be self-reliant in nature. Facilities will not be developed and instead visitors will be encouraged to use the facilities offered by surrounding areas. This encouragement can be done through signs within the park or uploading information onto the park&#x27;s website. Services plan to monitor activities of visitors to ensure that they are following guidelines set up to ensure for safety of both visitors and the park. Suggestions for monitoring activities include surveys of how many utilise the park as well as observing whether occupants have left belongings behind such as valuables or rubbish.

<text>The Blue Mountains National Park is a protected national park that is located in the Blue Mountains region of New South Wales, in eastern Australia. The national park is situated approximately west of the Sydney CBD, and the park boundary is quite irregular as it is broken up by roads, urban areas and areas of private property. Despite the name mountains, the area is an uplifted plateau, dissected by a number of larger rivers. The highest point in the park is Mount Werong at above sea level; while the low point is on the Nepean River at above sea level as it leaves the park.

The national park is one of the eight protected areas that, in 2000, was inscribed to form part of the UNESCO World Heritagelisted Greater Blue Mountains Area. The Greater Blue Mountains was one of 15 World Heritage places included in the National Heritage List on 21 May 2007. The Blue Mountains National Park is the most central of the eight protected areas within the World Heritage Site and it forms part of the Great Dividing Range. The park is also listed on the Australian Heritage Register and the overall complex of Blue Mountains regional walking tracks is listed on the State Heritage Register.

==History==

The genesis of the national park was a proposal by early conservationist Myles Dunphy for a Greater Blue Mountains National Park in 1932. This included large areas of what are today the Blue Mountains National Park, and the Wollemi, Kanangra-Boyd, Nattai, Gardens of Stone, and Thirlmere Lakes, along with other smaller nature reserves; all managed by the NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service. In September 1959 the Blue Mountains National Park was gazetted covering . In 2000 it was included as part of the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area. In 1999, 37 walking tracks were added to the State Heritage Register, extending from and the Nepean River in the east; to Mount Tomah in the north; to Wolgan Valley and in the northwest; to Jenolan Caves and in the west; and in the south, numerous walks leading down the plateau from Katoomba, Leura and Wentworth Falls.

==Geography==
The Blue Mountains National Park lies on the eastern side of the Great Dividing Range. The plateau slopes gently down from west to east from a height of around above sea level near to less than above sea level around Glenbrook. There are four major rivers that have most of their catchment inside the park: the Wollangambe River in the north, the Grose River in the centre, and the Coxs and Wollondilly rivers in the south. The latter two flow into Lake Burragorang, which is located just outside the park and is the site of Warragamba Dam, the major source of drinking water for Sydney. A small section of the Nepean River passes through the park. All of the major rivers flow from west to east.

==Geology==

Structurally, the Blue Mountains are part of the greater Sydney Basin. The Sydney Basin consists of layers of sedimentary rocks laid down over the past 300 million years. The Blue Mountains and Great Dividing Range were formed about 50 million years ago, when the area was uplifted. More recently, volcanic flows covered large areas of the mountains in basalt. These have largely worn away, leaving only occasional outcrops on the high peaks.

==Biodiversity==
The park contains a small range of eucalypt species across a variety of habitats including wet and dry Sclerophyll, Mallee, swamps, wetlands and grasslands. Some species are of significance to our understanding of plant evolution including the Wollemi Pine, of which fewer than 100 trees are known. Notable plant families include Myrtaceae, Fabaceae and Proteaceae including 114 endemic and 177 threatened species.

This range of habitats supports a rich variety of fauna, including a third of Australia&#x27;s bird species, and numerous mammals, reptiles and frogs. Notable endangered and endemic species include the Regent Honeyeater, Broad-headed snake and the Blue Mountains water skink.

==Tourism==
The Blue Mountains National Park is the most visited National Park in NSW with more than half of domestic visitors originating from Sydney and one of the easiest locations to spot wild kangaroos in Sydney. The majority of tourists to the Blue Mountains see the national park from one of the many lookouts between Wentworth Falls and Blackheath, and many of these never actually set foot in the park. Activities for the visitor include short walks to lookouts above cliffs and waterfalls, overnight and longer walks to more remote areas of the park and more extreme sports such as canyoning, abseiling, rock climbing and mountain biking. A number of Blue Mountains sightseeing and adventure tour companies can assist visitors in safely experiencing these activities. It is also home to the world&#x27;s steepest railway, the Katoomba Scenic Railway.

The national park is renowned for the Three Sisters rock formation. Both north and south of Blackheath, the cliffs are the most spectacular as the rock faces are several hundreds metres tall. Visitor numbers have increased to 5.2 million in 2016 from 3.6 million in 2008.

==Southern Blue Mountains==
The Blue Labyrinth is a forested eroded plateau directly south of the Great Western Highway, stretching from Wentworth Falls to Glenbrook, stretching from Kings Tableland in the west to Warragamba Dam and the Nepean River in the east, and the Burragorang Valley to the south.

The national park extends south as far as the Wollondilly River, west of Mittagong, New South Wales. This area was greatly affected by the construction of Warragamba Dam from 1948 to 1960. This required the flooding of the Burragorang Valley, which created Lake Burragorang and in the process cut the southern part of the Blue Mountains off from areas to the east, for example Camden, Picton and Bargo. Properties and homesteads in the southern part of the mountains were forced to close down, leaving many derelict homes and ruins. These included &quot;Bran Jan House&quot; and &quot;Kowmung House&quot; on Scotts Main Range, as well as &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, south of Yerranderie.

An exclusion zone of approximately three kilometres was created around Lake Burragorang to protect Sydney&#x27;s water supply, but a through-track was allowed from Yerranderie to Balloon Pass, then further east, for the benefit of bushwalkers. This pass was later incorporated into the long-distance Katoomba to Mittagong Trail.

<text>Boonoo Boonoo National Park (pronounced &#x27;bunna bunoo&#x27;) is a national park in New South Wales, Australia, 571 km north of Sydney and 26 kilometres north east of Tenterfield off Mount Lindesay Road.

The Boonoo Boonoo River passes through the park and includes a cascading 210-metre waterfall and a rainforest filled gorge. Bushwalking, swimming and bush camping are among the attractions of this area. In this park, the weather can be extreme and unpredictable, so visitors must be prepared for various surprises.

Boonoo Boonoo is the Aboriginal name given to the area which means &#x27;poor country with no animals to provide food&#x27;, however, the environment changed and it became home to Kangaroos and Wallabies.

Many wild animals have found their habitats in the diverse vegetation of the park that includes among others such ROTAP species as &quot;Callistemon flavovirens&quot;.

<doc id="100989" wikidata="Q893143" url="?curid=100989" title="Booti Booti National Park">
<text>Booti Booti National Park () is a national park in New South Wales, Australia, , by road, north-north-east of Sydney. The holiday town of Forster-Tuncurry lies immediately to the north.

==History==
The first European to inhabit the area was a Captain J. Gogerly who sailed from Forster to Sydney with loads of timber. He and some of his family are buried in the park. Mining for mineral sands took place at Seven Mile Beach from 1969 to 1975, and at Elizabeth Beach from 1969 to 1970. The park was declared a state recreation area from 30 September 1977, then a national park in 1992.

==Geography==
Geographically, the national park is made up of three hill complexes – the high Cape Hawke to the north, and high Booti Hill and high Charlotte Head in the southern end. The three areas are connected by low–lying estuarine and aeolian sands. The stretch of land between Cape Hawke and Booti Hill is around long and ranges between and wide. It separates Wallis Lake from the ocean. Cape Hawke and Charlotte Head were once islands, which became joined to the mainland by built-up sand deposits.

==Flora==
654 species of native plants have been recorded from Booti Booti National Park. This formed 46 distinct plant communities within the park boundaries. 17% of the park is classified as rainforest. Seven distinct wet sclerophyll forest and ten dry sclerophyll forest communities have been recorded.

Five species recognised as &quot;threatened&quot; by the New South Wales Government occur within the park – these are &quot;Allocasuarina defungens&quot;, &quot;A. simulans&quot;, &quot;Chamaesyce psammogeton&quot;, &quot;Cynanchum elegans&quot; and &quot;Senna acclinis&quot;.

104 exotic species have been recorded from the park. Bitou bush (&quot;Chrysanthemoides monilifera&quot; var. &quot;rotundata&quot;) has infested sand dunes and cliff areas, having spread from nearby beach habitat. &quot;Lantana camara&quot; infests the rainforest at Cape Hawke, particularly disturbed habitat. Madeira vine (&quot;Anredera cordifolia&quot;) and coast morning glory (&quot;Ipomoea cairica&quot;) are vines that grow over and smother native vegetation in the park.

==Fauna==
Booti Booti National Park has had 210 species of bird recorded within its limits.

==Activities==
Activities at Booti Booti National Park include hiking, swimming, birdwatching, mooning and, during winter, whale watching. Camping sites are located at The Ruins, in the Booti Hill area at the park&#x27;s southern end. A lookout is located on top of Cape Hawke.

<text>The Border Ranges National Park is a protected national park that is located in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Australia. A small portion of the national park is also located in South East Queensland. The park is situated approximately south of Brisbane, north of .

The park is part of the Shield Volcano Group World Heritage Site Gondwana Rainforests of Australia inscribed in 1986 and added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2007.

==Geology==
The Border Ranges region, which includes the McPherson Range, Tweed Range, Lamington Plateau and Levers Plateau, were formed from the erosion of the Tweed Volcano over many years. A number of volcanic plugs remain in the Border Ranges National Park. Notable for extensive stands of &quot;Nothofagus moorei&quot; (Antarctic beech), the park offers a gravel road circuit through sub tropical, cool and warm temperate rainforest types. The area was extensively logged during the 20th century, providing timber to a number of nearby sawmills. The Lions Road and the Sydney–Brisbane rail corridor pass through the park at its narrow middle section.

==Flora and fauna==
Border Ranges and Lamington National Park are recognised as a biodiversity hotspot, containing a mixture of northern and southern flora species (the McPherson-Macleay overlap) with a number of endemic, rare and endangered species. Fauna is similarly diverse and species like the Hastings River mouse, have been rediscovered in the park in recent years.
Lower areas of the park contain eucalypt forests that provide habitat for eastern grey kangaroos, red-necked wallabies and koalas. Pademelons and potoroo are also found in the park as well as a diverse array of birdlife including the rare Albert&#x27;s lyrebird. The park is part of the Scenic Rim Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance in the conservation of several species of threatened birds.
The Border Ranges contains one of Australia&#x27;s most diverse range of spider species within its montane rainforests.

==Facilities==
Two camp grounds (car/camper and walk-in tent camping only) and a number of picnic areas, some with shelters, water and composting toilets, are available at various points in the rainforest adjacent to the road, and one picnic spot at Blackbutts Lookout, has extensive views to Mount Warning, and of the Tweed Valley, an erosion caldera which, while broken by the sea on its eastern flank, is considered larger in size than the Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania.

<doc id="100991" wikidata="Q894672" url="?curid=100991" title="Kamay Botany Bay National Park">
<text>The Kamay Botany Bay National Park is a heritage-listed protected national park that is located in the eastern part of Botany Bay in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The national park is situated approximately south-east of the Sydney central business district, on the northern and southern headlands of Botany Bay. The northern headland is at La Perouse and the southern headland is at Kurnell.

The visitor attraction, natural conservation and heritage conservation area at Cape Solander Drive is also known as Kamay Botany Bay National Park (North and South) and Towra Point Nature Reserve, La Perouse Monument, Tomb of [[Louis Receveur|&quot;Père&quot; (Fr.) Receveur]], Macquarie Watchtower and Cable Station. The property is owned by NSW Office of Environment and Heritage and managed by the NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service, both agencies of the Government of New South Wales. Kamay Botany Bay was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 29 November 2013, and was added to the Australian National Heritage List on 10 September 2017. It is also included in a UNESCO World Heritage serial nomination &#x27;The Rise of Systemic Biology&#x27;.

The area is recognised for its outstanding cultural and historic heritage values to Australia. It is a place where botanist Sir Joseph Banks and naturalist Dr Daniel Solander collected plant specimens in 1770 as part of the first landing of the &quot;Endeavour&quot; in Australia. Banks and Solander collected many iconic Australian plant species, including some type specimens; these have important scientific and research value. The national park is also the site where Captain James Cook first set foot on Australian soil in 1770, marking the beginning of Britain&#x27;s interest in Australia.

== History ==
===Geological history===
Botany Bay lies within a small tectonic depression known as the Botany Basin which in turn is situated within the larger Sydney Basin comprising modified sedimentary deposits laid down about 270 million years ago during the Permian period. The northern and southern headlands feature cliffs of Hawkesbury sandstone cliffs, which was formed during the Triassic period, between 200 and 250 million years ago.

On the Kurnell Peninsula, about 20,000 years ago at the height of the ice age, the Kurnell headland was a sandstone hill. The old dunes formed much of what is now Botany Bay and the Kurnell headland. Between 18,000 and 10,000 years ago, as the sea level rose, seagrass, salt marsh and mangroves developed and moved inland. The first evidence of Indigenous occupation of the area appears to be about 12,000 years ago. At this time the swales of the old dunes contained swamps.

By 7,400 years ago the sea level stopped rising and the cliffs and rock platforms at Kurnell were eroded by wave action to form sheer cliffs. Between 9,000 and 6,000 years ago the Kurnell isthmus began to form as the mud and sand of the Georges River built up.

The locations now known as Silver Beach and Bonna Point were subject to a buildup of sand from about 6,500 years ago. At about the same time a series of parallel dunes formed behind Bate Beach and Towra Point as the Georges River estuary shifted and sand and mud were dropped to the north of the Kurnell isthmus. The mud and sand deposit breached sea level and a dune formed on the deposit. This dune was vegetated with Kurnell dune forest, treed wetland, littoral rainforest, mangroves, sheoaks and saltmarsh.

From 4,500 years ago swamps developed in the low parts of the dunes and a series of moving dunes formed as a result of violent weather events. These new dunes covered the peninsula and the tidal flats of Botany Bay. Here again, swamps formed in these new dunes, allowing soils and dune forest to develop. As these dunes eroded, sandstone was exposed and eventually sandstone heath colonised that area. Between 3,000 and 2,000 years ago the sea level dropped to current levels.

===Aboriginal people pre-contact===
Most archaeological evidence relates to Indigenous occupation in the area from about 3,000 to 2,000 years ago. People living to the south of Botany Bay to Nowra spoke the Dharawal language group. The people moving through and living in the Kurnell area were the northernmost clan of the Dharawal speakers, the Gweagal. On the northern headland the people were most likely Cadigal people of the Darug language group.

The people living on the headlands and shores at the entrance to Botany Bay benefited from the many food and other resources and the mild climate of the area. On both shorelines are many midden sites providing evidence of the rich variety of sea foods enjoyed by the Indigenous people, as well as reptiles and mammals which also lived in the heath and forests. Fishing was the major source of food for the Indigenous people of the area. Fish hooks were made from turban shells, and fishing lines and nets were made from bark and native grasses. Timber from the forests at Kurnell and La Perouse provided bark for huts, canoes, and coolamons, and lomandra leaves were woven together to make bags.

Many of the local plants were edible, such as the roots of the common fern and warrigal, a spinach-like leafy plant that grew along the local fresh water streams on both northern and southern headlands. Other foods included the nectar from &quot;Banksia&quot; flowers and witchetty grubs which lived in the stems of banksia and wattle.

Because of its bountiful resources, the north and south headlands of Botany Bay were important ceremonial gathering places for the Dharawal on the south of Botany Bay and the Darug on the northern shores. At Kurnell there are several important ceremonial sites, including a bora ring used for rites and an ochre pit located near the current site of the oil refinery which provided pigment for such ceremonies.

Kurnell was possibly a semi-permanent home for the Gweagal. A marker tree distinguished by a ring-shaped hole in its trunk marks the site of a women&#x27;s camp. The area also contains carved trees from which the bark for canoes and coolamons were taken and a women&#x27;s birthing site, indicating the intensive use of the area by the pre-contact Gweagal community.

Aboriginal ancestral remains have been reburied in the park. These remains, taken from the Botany Bay region, were stored in various museum collections until repatriation. For Aboriginal people, the return of ancestors&#x27; remains to Country is highly significant because it then reunites ancestors with Country.

Similarly, the La Perouse section of the park contains evidence of everyday lives of Aboriginal people before European settlement, including middens and engravings that illustrate the everyday observations and preoccupations of the Indigenous people before European contact.

===Arrival of Cook===

In the days preceding 29 April 1770 Dharawal people of the southern coastal area between Nowra and Kurnell observed a large &quot;white bird&quot; (oral tradition of the local people) or &quot;floating island&quot; which was Lieutenant James Cook&#x27;s &quot;Endeavour&quot;, as it passed along the coast towards the headlands of Kamay ( Botany Bay). Further south the Yuin people attributed their sightings of the &quot;Endeavour&quot; to &quot;Gurung-gubba&quot;, the pelican of their Dreamtime stories. The Endeavour entered Botany Bay and lay anchor opposite the location of a small bark hut village on the southern shores of Kamay Botany Bay. Here James Cook and some of his crew prepared to land on the shores of Gweagal country. It is now understood that Cook&#x27;s bold arrival and landing on Dharawal land was a severe breach of Indigenous etiquette and an affront to the traditional owners of the land at Kurnell.

In traditional Aboriginal culture it is customary for visitors to wait to be invited to approach the custodians of that area, so when Cook and his men landed, the local people attempted to discourage the strangers from entering the land: two warriors painted in ceremonial ochre threatened the British with spears, to which Cook ordered either one or two muskets fired. One shot found its mark and hit one of the warriors, who ran to find a shield and continued the defence of his country. As Cook and his party landed, one of the warriors threw a spear before they retreated and commenced to ignore the intruders for the entire time the British were anchored in the bay. This is consistent with the customary right of country owners to demand to meet visitors on their own terms.

During the following eight days the passengers and crew of the &quot;Endeavour&quot; explored the shores and hinterland areas around Botany Bay. The main purpose of visiting Botany Bay was to obtain fresh water for the next leg of the journey. On the second day of their stay, Cook and his men found a stream located near the bark hut village, from which they replenished the ships water supplies. The stream still flows today.

The location of the Endeavour&#x27;s landfall and Cook&#x27;s claim of the east coast of the continent for Britain is now commonly known as Captain Cook&#x27;s Landing Place.

One of the most significant activities undertaken that week was the botanical collecting by Sir Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, noted pupil of Carolus Linnaeus. On completing his studies in Sweden, Solander travelled to England to promote the Linnaean system of classification and soon took up a position classifying collections at the British Museum. He was employed by Banks in 1768 to assist him on Cook&#x27;s voyage of exploration.

Banks and Solander collected many plant and animal specimens at Botany Bay, including many which had not been collected or described previously and became the type specimens of species and genera, including the &quot;Banksia&quot;, named for Joseph Banks. Much of the collection work was carried out near the landing place and in the area now known as Towra Point and its wetlands, as well as on the northern shore of Botany Bay.

The extent and quality of the specimens collected led Cook to name the bay Botany Bay in acknowledgment of the important work undertaken by Banks and Solander. Besides being described and classified by Solander, every specimen was sketched by Sydney Parkinson. These sketches were rendered as watercolours when Banks and Solander returned to England and then engraved and later included in the publication &quot;Banks&#x27; Florilegium&quot;.

===Arrival of Phillip===
On 18 January 1788, eighteen years after the first visit by the British, Governor Arthur Phillip arrived at Botany Bay with the First Fleet, where they intended to establish the first British settlement in the colony. While anchored in Botany Bay a number of officers established seemingly friendly contact with the Aboriginal people, exchanging whistling tunes, confirming humanity and gender and exchanging gifts. On the southern shores they introduced a child travelling with the fleet to the Aboriginal people there.

Phillip was disappointed at the lack of water on the shores of the bay and dismayed by the large numbers of Aboriginal people inhabiting the place. By 26 January 1788, Phillip had left Botany Bay and sailed for Port Jackson, where the first settlement in Australia was made.

=== Arrival of Lapérouse ===
At the same time, Botany Bay was visited by the French expedition under the command of Jean-Francois Galaup de Lapérouse, whose frigates &quot;La Boussole&quot; and &quot;Astrolabe&quot; anchored near Frenchman&#x27;s Beach on 24 January 1788. Captain Hunter of the First Fleet established contact with the French in the absence of Governor Phillip.

The French ships had sailed from Samoa, where they had been involved in a battle with the Samoans. Numerous people on both sides were killed and injured. One of those injured in the event was the expedition&#x27;s priest and naturalist, &quot;Père&quot; Receveur. Receveur died at La Perouse on 17 February 1788 and was the first French person to be buried on the mainland. He was interred in a headland grave marked with a common headstone. In 1829, a tomb was erected over the site of his grave.

The French spent six weeks at La Perouse, during which time they repaired damage done during the Samoan battle. An observatory was established on the northern headland for the use of Joseph Lepaute Dagelet, whose observations and scientific experiments are among the first European scientific endeavours in Australia. Dagelet undertook calculations on map positions of Botany Bay and carried out astronomical observations which he later shared with Englishman William Dawes.

The departure of Phillip and then Lapérouse from Botany Bay marked a period of time where, at least on the southern shores of the bay, Aboriginal people did not come into much contact with Europeans. The Kurnell headland was a remote spot and was not subject to a land grant until 1815. On the northern shores of the bay, the La Perouse peninsula remained relatively unsettled until the 1860s and 1880s, when a pioneering fishing community worked the waters at Botany Bay and lived in La Perouse.

While their land was not immediately settled by Europeans, white colonisation had a profound impact on the people of the area, the most significant being the spread of disease such as smallpox. There are caves at Little Bay just north of the northern section of the Botany Bay National Park and also a cave on Cape Solander in the southern section of the park in which it is believed that skeletal remains from these outbreaks were found, though this has not been confirmed.

===Settlement during the 19th and 20th centuries: La Perouse===
By 1830, the land which is now the northern section of Botany Bay National Park was dedicated as a Government reserve. From about 1820, a small contingent of Government troops were stationed at La Perouse headland to scout for the unexpected arrival of ships and to monitor and control smuggling activity. By 1822, these troops were housed in Macquarie&#x27;s Tower, a sandstone castellated watchtower. From 1829, when the monuments to Lapérouse and &quot;Pere&quot; Receveur were erected, the watchtower was used as accommodation for a caretaker employed to look after the Lapérouse Monument and the tomb of &quot;Père&quot; Receveur. These monuments are still frequently visited by the French and are the site of events such as a memorial ceremony on Bastille Day each year, a mass to &quot;Père&quot; Receveur and Lapérouse Day.

In 1831, the watchtower was acquired by the Customs Department to house a tide waiter, or customs officer, and two boatmen who manned the La Perouse customs house outstation.

By 1869, in response to the perceived threat of armed attack by foreign forces, a program to bolster the colony&#x27;s defences was in place and a military road was constructed to the La Perouse headland. By 1871 a gun battery was in place on Henry Head. In 1881 a large &quot;mass concrete&quot; fort was under construction on Bare Island; it was operational by 1890.

La Perouse headland was the site where the overseas underwater telegraphic cable emerged in 1876. The first makeshift facility of tents and huts was replaced in 1881 by a brick cable station sited centrally on the west of the headland overlooking Frenchman&#x27;s Beach. After 1917, when it was no longer used as offices for the telegraph company, it became a nurses&#x27; home and later a home run by the Salvation Army. Most recently it is used as the La Perouse Museum.

Many Aboriginal people who had traditionally lived in the La Perouse area left after the establishment of European settlement, but by the 1870s Aboriginal people, including descendants from families associated with La Perouse and Botany Bay, along with Aboriginal people from the south coast, began to return to the area. When George Thornton, the government&#x27;s Protector of Aborigines, started removing Aboriginal people from urban areas, he was successfully lobbied by a group from La Perouse, who were allowed to remain at the La Perouse camp. Thornton even constructed huts for them at the camp, justifying the decision to parliament by arguing that the camp was economically viable. By 1881 there were two camps with 35 Aboriginal people recorded to be living at La Perouse and a further 15 in Botany Bay within the boundaries of what is today Kamay Botany Bay National Park.

In 1881, there was an outbreak of smallpox in the colony. To deal with the epidemic, an isolation hospital was established at Little Bay; it became known as the Coast Hospital and then in 1934 became Prince Henry Hospital. Associated with the Coast Hospital is the Coast Cemetery, which is located south of the hospital and now is enclosed by Kamay Botany Bay National Park.

The Coast Hospital Cemetery is an Aboriginal Place and is an important burial, repatriation, and reburial site for the La Perouse and Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land councils and Dharawal Aboriginal people. In 1881, the first part of the Coast Hospital Cemetery was opened. This section was used until 1897, when a northern burial section was established and used until 1952. The cemetery was used as a burial ground for the La Perouse Aboriginal reserve, though it served predominantly as a burial ground for patients who died of infectious diseases at Prince Henry Hospital. There are 90 marked graves in the Coast Hospital Cemetery, but it is estimated that up to 3,000 people are buried there. The area was selected as an Aboriginal repatriation and reburial site because of its long-standing significance to the local Aboriginal people. The cemetery contains the burials of several family members. Aboriginal ancestral remains were reburied within the Dharawal Resting Place (previously known as the Little Bay Cemetery Resting Place) in 2002 and 2005. Members of the La Perouse and Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land councils and other Dharawal descendants regularly visit the area, maintaining close connections to Country and ancestors.

A small Anglican Aboriginal mission was established in the area in 1885 and a church built in 1894. In 1895 the camp at Frenchmans Bay, La Perouse was gazetted as an Aboriginal reserve. The people who lived there worked as fishermen, in the Chinese Gardens, or at the timber mills and wool washes in the area, or they made boomerang and other artefacts for sale to tourists, who flocked to the area after the construction of the tramway to La Perouse at the turn of the century. Many women and children crafted shell decorations for sale.

During the Great Depression, La Perouse was the site of a shanty town known as Happy Valley, which was located within the boundaries of the Botany Bay National Park behind Congwong Beach. Those who arrived at Happy Valley simply selected a spot and erected their home from corrugated iron or whatever could be found. Reputedly there was much positive interaction between residents at Happy Valley and those on the Aboriginal reserve. While life was hard at Happy Valley, some unemployed residents valued the site for its carefree existence and beach access. In 1939, after intense lobbying by the neighbouring golf club, Randwick Council moved all the residents to more suitable accommodation and demolished the shanty town.

During the 1960s, a wave of new white residents arrived at La Perouse and lobbied for the removal of the reserve at Yarra Bay. The Aboriginal community has resisted these efforts and the La Perouse community remains one of the strongest and most established Aboriginal communities in Sydney.

===Settlement in the 19th and 20th century: Kurnell===
In 1815, Governor Macquarie made a grant of 700 acres of land to James Birnie at Kurnell. Here Birnie established a farm, raising vegetables and stock and constructing a homestead on the site of the current Alpha House near Captain Cooks Landing Place in the Kamay Botany Bay National Park.

In 1821, another grant was made of 1,000 acres at the nearby Quibray Bay to John Connell, a free settler who arrived in NSW in 1801 and set up a large ironmongery in Sydney. When in 1828 Birnie was declared insane, Connell bought Alpha Farm, and by 1838 he owned almost the entire Kurnell Peninsula. His grandson John inherited the estate on John senior&#x27;s death in 1851. He cleared the land heavily and sold the timber to the Sydney market.

Facing financial ruin in 1860, John Connell Jr mortgaged his landholdings at Kurnell to Thomas Holt, who took ownership in 1861. Holt, a successful wool merchant and member of the Legislative Council, was a prominent and influential figure in the New South Wales.

Holt established a scientific oyster farming program at Quibray Bay, attempted to raise sheep on specially planted pastures of imported grass and dabbled in timber and even coal mining on the Kurnell Peninsula. This work was done with the assistance of many employees, including a number of Aboriginal people such as William Rowley, a Gweagal man, who was also an enterprising local fisherman born at Towra Point.

Despite Holt&#x27;s efforts at Kurnell, none of the enterprises were very successful, and by 1881 he began subdividing the estate. Even this exercise was not successful, and unsold lots within the current national park were set aside as a public reserve in the 1899, along with an area similarly reserved at an earlier date. The reserve, totalling 100 hectares at the time, was managed by a trust under the auspices of the Department of Lands.

From the 1820s Captain Cook&#x27;s Landing Place was a popular destination for people with an interest in European history in Australia. Many people visited various places of interest, such as the plaque at Inscription Point, which had been installed by the Philosophical Society of Australasia in the early 1820s. In 1870 Thomas Holt erected Cook&#x27;s Obelisk to mark the European arrival at Botany Bay. To cope with the area&#x27;s increasing visitation, Holt built the first wharf at Kurnell just adjacent to the obelisk, and a steam ferry began to operate some time around 1882.

The reserve was the responsibility of the Department of Lands up until 1967 and was managed by a trust right up until 1974. The trust employed a caretaker and field staff to maintain the reserve. It also spent considerable time and money on siting and erecting monuments to Cook and his crew. In 1918 the trust erected the Solander Obelisk and in 1947 the Banks Memorial.

A cottage was erected on the site of the first Alpha Farm House, providing accommodation for visitors as well as for the reserve caretaker, whose wife operated a kiosk from the kitchen.

In the years after the Second World War, under the management of the trust, the area became a hugely popular holiday destination for campers. Families who faithfully returned to camp there each year set up semi-permanent camps in small timber cabins and tents painted with calcimine for weatherproofing, with stoves and camp beds. Most of their food they brought with them, but fresh milk was sourced daily from the caretaker&#x27;s wife, who managed a herd of cows which roamed the reserve. Holiday camping at the park continued until around 1977, when the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service discontinued this use and disposed of the semi-permanent dwellings.

Like La Perouse, the Kurnell section of Botany Bay National Park had a shanty town. This was established in the cliff overhangs and caves overlooking the Pacific Ocean at Cape Solander and Tabbagi Gap. The earliest dwelling was built in 1919, and others were constructed during the Great Depression in the 1930s. These dwellings were constructed of tin and timber, and stoves and other home wares were installed to make the place comfortable. They continued to be used during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s by recreational fishermen and local eccentrics.

The Aboriginal people of La Perouse retained a strong link with the Kurnell section of the Botany Bay National Park throughout the 20th century. Kurnell was a frequent destination for family groups who would travel over by ferry and spend the day fishing, swimming, foraging for bush foods. The banks of Cook&#x27;s Stream was a source of warrigal greens, and further afield one could find five-corner berries, wombat berries and sarsaparilla.

Sonny Simms, who grew up at La Perouse in the 1930s and 1940s, recalled that the resources of the bay, its fish and shellfish, were an important supplement to the family&#x27;s food resources when his father left and his mother became the sole provider for her family of nine children. The family would travel to Kurnell, where their mother taught them how to catch fish, lobster and abalone. The fish caught would be cooked in an old five-gallon drum and eaten on the spot.

Other resources found in the park and at Towra Point were the mangrove knees, which up until the late 1960s were harvested to make boomerangs for the tourist trade. The shells for the La Perouse women&#x27;s shell craft work were collected from the beach at Wanda.

The huge sand dunes and their large freshwater ponds were a strong memory for Sonny Simms, who as a child regularly swam in these. The dunes survived relatively unaffected up until the 1950s, when the oil refinery was established there. It was not until the Sydney building boom in the late 1960s and 1970s that the demand for sand resulted in the dunes becoming degraded by sand mining over much of the Kurnell Peninsula.

In 1967 the reserve at Kurnell was handed over to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which, besides its environmental charter, had custody of historic sites, of which Captain Cook&#x27;s Landing Place at Kurnell was one. By 1974 National Parks and Wildlife Service was able to take on the full management of the park and the reserve trust was disbanded. The Botany Bay National Park was finally gazetted in 1988.

Under the management of National Parks and Wildlife Service much work has been done to redress the balance in articulating the Aboriginal and European historical and cultural values of the place. This is evidenced in the renaming of the longstanding Commemoration Day ceremony as the Meeting of Cultures ceremony and the structured involvement of local Aboriginal elders in the ceremony. In addition Aboriginal people have been closely involved in other important events in the park, such as the start to the Olympic Torch Relay in 2000, which was begun by one of the Aboriginal park rangers. A significant amount of work has been done to the interpret the history and connections of the site: in particular, the opening of interpretive walks and the re-opening of the freshwater stream.

Perhaps the most significant events to have been held in the park in recent years have been the repatriation burials. These events are of great importance to the local Aboriginal community as local elders received back the remains of their ancestors from public institutions where they were studied and regarded as curiosities in their own land. The La Perouse museum precinct in Botany Bay National Park is to be reinvigorated, with the NSW Government and Randwick City Council moving to lease the historic site.

== Description ==
The total area of the proposed listing is . of the listing comprises Kamay Botany Bay National Park, situated on the north and south sandstone headlands of Botany Bay. The headlands create the dramatic entrance to Botany Bay, which is located about 14 km south of the centre of Sydney. The listing boundary also includes the Towra Point Nature Reserve, an area of of wetlands located to the west of Kurnell village in Botany Bay.

===Northern section===

Approximately of Kamay Botany Bay National Park is located on the northern headland and includes Cape Banks, the coast land at Cruwee Cove, Henry Head, Congwong Beach, scrub-covered dune to Anzac Parade and the peninsula on the north-eastern corner of Botany Bay known as La Perouse Headland. As Bare Island and the causeway joining it to the mainland are already listed on the State Heritage Register, they are not included in the curtilage of this listing.

The coast is characterised by rocky sandstone cliffs demonstrating a fine example of the stratification of Hawkesbury sandstone. The cliff formations are punctuated by large gorges, the result of eroded basalt dykes which formed in the sedimentary rock in the early Tertiary period.

The sandy soils are covered with diverse vegetation comprising over 350 species once common in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, including rare species and communities. The most common vegetation cover is heath &quot;Banksia&quot; community (&quot;Banksia ericifolia&quot;), prickly tea tree (&quot;Leptospermum juniperinum&quot;) and paperbark (&quot;Melaleuca nodosa&quot;). To the west of the park is a thick covering of coastal tea tree scrub (&quot;Leptospermum laevigatum&quot;) consisting of coast banksia (&quot;Banksia integrifolia&quot;) and bangalay (&quot;Eucalyptus botryoides&quot;). In sheltered areas such as behind little Congwong Bay lies a low closed forest of smooth-barked apple (&quot;Angophora costata&quot;).

Rare vegetation communities in the park include the wet heath between Henry Head and Cape Banks and the closed forest around Happy Valley. The stands of Eastern Suburbs banksia scrub are considered to be an endangered community. An area of land bordering on Grose Street contains over 140 species, including plants regarded as rare and the last remaining example of the full diversity of Eastern Suburbs banksia scrub. It also contains several rare freshwater swamps. This part of the park attracts over 70 species of native birds, as well as possums, flying foxes, bats and snakes.

The northern section of Kamay Botany Bay National Park contains a number of sites relating to the pre-contact Aboriginal occupation, including rock engravings and shell middens.

The La Perouse Headland contains significant historic items including Macquarie Watchtower, Lapérouse Monument, &quot;Père&quot; Receveur&#x27;s grave, the cable station (now the La Perouse Museum), the Coast Cemetery, fortifications including Henry Head Battery and Fort Banks, and the site of the Happy Valley settlement.

The Macquarie Watchtower is a two-storey, octagonal Sydney sandstone tower approximately tall. The walls are topped by a castellated parapet that was reconstructed . The structure has window openings which have been in-filled with sandstone blocks and an entry door on the southern facade.

The former cable station is a two-storey rendered masonry building situated on a grassy knoll of La Perouse Headland facing north overlooking Frenchman&#x27;s Bay. The orientation of the building is attributed to the positioning of the telegraph cable, which came ashore at Frenchman&#x27;s Bay. Designed by the Colonial Architects Office, the building has a single-storey veranda on its northern facade and a U-shaped plan. Originally symmetrical, the building has had additional bays added to either end of the building.

Also situated on the La Perouse Headland is a monument to the French expedition of 1788 led by Jean-Franois de Galaup Lapérouse and the grave of &quot;Père&quot; Receveur. The Lapérouse monument has a central obelisk topped by a spherical brass astrolabe. It is mounted on a base and surrounded by a low wall topped with a steel picket fence. Plaques have been placed around the monument commemorating the voyages of other French ships. The headstone and tomb of &quot;Père&quot; Receveur, the priest and naturalist of the French expedition, was erected many years after his death. The grave was initially marked by an inscription on a tree and over time became more formalised.

Behind Congwong Beach is the location of a former settlement known as Happy Valley, a collection of shacks erected during the Depression. The shacks have been removed and vegetation has regenerated. There is potential for archaeology dating from this period of occupation.

There are coastal fortifications located on Henry Head and Cape Banks designed and constructed by the British army from the late 19th century onwards.

Behind the headland is the original Coast Hospital Cemetery, which is now a designated Aboriginal Place: the Dharawal Resting Place – Coast Hospital Cemetery. It contains approximately 3,000 burials. There are some headstones and the remains of a paved stone road to the site. Aboriginal ancestral remains were reburied within the Dharawal Resting Place (previously known as the Little Bay Cemetery Resting Place) in 2002 and 2005.

===Southern section===

The southern section of Kamay Botany Bay National Park covers an area of about on the eastern end of the Kurnell Peninsula. The area of the park to the north-east of Kurnell village is bounded by the waters of Botany Bay and large rock platforms.

 This area, which is sometimes referred to as &quot;The Meeting Place&quot;, extends over approximately of the eastern part of the park. Silver Beach is located here.

The Meeting Place precinct contains many items of pre-contact Aboriginal heritage: shell middens, burial sites, a bora ring, a birthing tree and other items of Aboriginal heritage significance. It also contains post-contact heritage items of significance to both European and Aboriginal history.

The Meeting Place contains a number of monuments and memorials to Cook; the botanist Solander; Sir Joseph Banks; and Forby Sutherland, an Endeavour crew member who died at Botany Bay. It also contains Alpha House, previously known as the Kurnell accommodation house, constructed by the Captain Cook&#x27;s Landing Place Trust in 1902. The accommodation house was built on the remains of two earlier dwellings, and a cellar of one of these remains beneath the cottage.

An important element, historically and environmentally is the stream that flows into Botany Bay near the landing place. It was here that Cook and his party restocked their fresh water supplies under the eye of the local Aboriginal people. There have been a number of archaeological excavations in this area, on the flat between the wharf and the stream, and in the vicinity of the Alpha House site. The area is considered to have high archaeological potential. The place is marked by a plaque and by more recent interpretive works.

The southern and eastern boundary of the park follows the high Hawkesbury sandstone cliff landscape of Cape Solander, which is punctuated by deep narrow gorges at Tabagai Gap and Yena Gap. Further to the south this rocky coastal boundary gives way to sand dunes which extend south to Potter Point. Within the cliff landscape and dunes of this area there have been archaeological excavations, these areas are also considered to have archaeological potential. Dune landscape characterises the southern part of the park inland. Vegetation is mainly Kurnell dune forest, which grows on the sand hills that overlook the coast where Cook is said to have landed. There are pockets of dry eucalypt forest on the higher reaches, and this forest continues over Cape Solander Drive and up to the sandstone heights approaching the sandstone cliffs falling to the ocean on the east.

The area down to Potters Point supports heath lands on sandstone and heath on dunes, which are characterised by old man banksia (&quot;Banksia serrata&quot;), sheoak (&quot;Allocasuarina distyla&quot;) and grass trees (&quot;Xanthorrhoea resinosa&quot;). There are also wetlands on sandstone and wetlands in dunes which sustain native grasses (&quot;Gahnia sieberiana&quot; and &quot;Scirpus littoralis&quot;), lemon-scented bottlebrush (&quot;Callistemon citrinus&quot;), and heath banksia (&quot;Banksia robur&quot;), which are rare in the Sydney region. As well as pockets of dry eucalyptus forest, there are also several pockets of Kurnell dune forest in the southern reaches of the park and important patches of littoral rainforest.

Among the diversity of fauna living on the Kurnell Peninsula are endangered or vulnerable species. The green and gold bell frog (&quot;Litoria aurea&quot;) and the tinkling froglet (&quot;Crinia tinnula&quot;), both threatened, have been recorded in the southern part of the park, along with the more common eastern long-necked tortoise (&quot;Chelodina longicollis&quot;). Ninety-six species of bird frequent the scrub, forest wetlands and shores of the Kurnell Peninsula. Some of the species noted to be of local, state or regional significance are the Japanese snipe, whimbrel, Arctic jaeger, common eastern tern, peregrine falcon, red-necked stint, powerful owl (threatened), silvereye, red-browed finch, New Holland honeyeater and superb fairywren.

===Towra Point Nature Reserve===
Within the nature reserve is the Towra Point Keeping Place Aboriginal Place, which is an Aboriginal reburial site where ancestral remains have been returned to Country. Evidence of past Aboriginal occupation (campsites evidenced by shell middens and stone artefact scatters) can be found in the local area. Local vegetation is dominated by sclerophyll forest and includes coast banksia and tea tree.

The Ramsar listed wetlands reserve of 386 ha is located on the shores of Botany and Wooloware bays to the west of Kurnell village. The Towra Point landscape of alluvial and marine sands supports vegetation communities that are now rare in the Sydney region. There are vegetated dunes and coastal banksia woodlands, littoral rainforest patches and stands of rare bangalay and swamp oak forests. There are also a few stands of the magenta brush cherry (&quot;Syzygium paniculatum&quot;), a species listed as vulnerable. The area contains saltmarshes which support a rare sedge, &quot;Gahnia filum&quot;, which grows at the edge of the marshes, located on the land side of mangroves. The Towra Point wetlands are home to a large variety of local and migrating wading and shorebird species, as well being the second most important breeding site for the little tern (&quot;Sternula albifrons&quot;) and the only breeding place in the Sydney region. Other species which live in the wetlands include the pied oystercatcher (&quot;Haematopis longirostris&quot;), terek sandpiper (&quot;Tringa terek&quot;) and peregrine falcon (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;), all of which are listed as threatened in NSW. Full details of the vegetation communities at Towra Point can be found in Towra Point Nature Reserve Plan of Management.

===Features===
A number of memorials commemorating Australia&#x27;s history are located at the entrance to the Kurnell Peninsula portion of the park. This area has a coast walk connecting the memorials and is near the information centre and a museum.

The Kurnell Peninsula portion includes much of the eastern half of the promontory, adjacent to the Caltex Oil Refinery. The area is bordered by sandstone cliffs, eroded to a few metres above sea level in the north and higher in the south. The highest point is about above sea level and there are two mapped lookouts, Kurnell Lookout and Houston Lookout. Hills of dry sclerophyll bushland include Botany Cone at above sea level and Long Nose at . There are many small points and cliff formations and several walking tracks. The carpark and lookout at the end of the Yena Track is popular for whale watching in the migration season.

Also present in the park is the Cape Bailey Light, a lighthouse built in 1950.

== Heritage listing ==
As at 29 July 2013, Kamay Botany Bay National Park and Towra Point Nature Reserve are of outstanding state heritage significance as a rare place demonstrating the continuous history of occupation of the east coast of Australia. The place holds clear and valuable evidence of Indigenous occupation prior to European settlement and the natural history of the state. It is also the place where the shared history of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia began. It was the place where Lieutenant James Cook first stepped ashore to claim the country for Britain and plays a central role in the European history of arrival, the history of Indigenous resistance, dispossession and devastation through illness, land grants, cultivation and development.

Traditional Aboriginal custodians of the land and the current Aboriginal community have strong historical association with Kamay Botany Bay National Park and Towra Point Nature Reserve. Gweagal warriors resisted the arrival of Cook and continue to be important symbols of Aboriginal resilience. There are two important burial repatriation sites within the curtilage which are designated Aboriginal Places and have high social significance for the Aboriginal community.

The place is also significant for its historical association with important European explorers and scientists and their life&#x27;s work. These include James Cook, Joseph Banks, Daniel Solander, &quot; de&quot; Lapérouse, &quot;Père&quot; Receveur and Joseph Lepaute Dagelet. It is also associated with the First Fleet and the first Governor of NSW, Arthur Phillip.

The place is of state significance for the technical achievement of Banks and Solander who during their visit in 1770 made the first important collection of fauna and flora from Australia which included some items that had never before been described and classified. Previous archaeological excavations indicate that Kamay Botany Bay National Park and Towra Point Nature Reserve have significance for their high level of archaeological potential.

Kamay Botany Bay National Park and Towra Point Nature Reserve have aesthetic value as landmark headlands and natural areas with a collection of historic monuments that, combined, have important symbolism to the state of NSW. Both northern and southern parts of the national park, together with the nature reserve, contain a valuable research resource relating to Indigenous occupation, the natural history of the state and the early settlement of the colony.

Kamay Botany Bay National Park and Towra Point Nature Reserve are of state heritage significance as they contains rare remnant vegetation and flora communities and is a critical link in the network of parks and reserves that conserve the biodiversity of NSW.

The La Perouse part the national park provides evidence of the history of French exploration in the Pacific in the late 19th century and continues to have ongoing cultural associations with the French community today.

Kamay Botany Bay National Park was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 29 November 2013 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

The geological and botanical features of Kamay Botany Bay National Park and Towra Point Nature Reserve are of state heritage significance for their ability to demonstrate the natural history of the state.

Kamay Botany Bay National Park and Towra Point Nature Reserve also have the ability to clearly demonstrate Indigenous pre-contact history of the state and to demonstrate aspects of the way of life of the Aboriginal people before European settlement.

Kamay Botany Bay Park is of exceptional heritage significance for the state as the place where the shared Indigenous and European history of Australia began. It was the place where Lieutenant James Cook first stepped ashore to claim the country for Britain and the first meeting place between Indigenous people and the colonisers. The place plays a central role in the European history of arrival and the history of Indigenous dispossession and devastation through illness, land grants, cultivation and development. The meeting of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia is a story that is central to the development of the colony and of symbolic importance to the state .

Kamay Botany Bay National Park is historically significant as it was the first point of landing of the first fleet of settlers in Australia and the site of later developments in colonial defences and customs regulation. It also demonstrates the early development of communications in the colony. The park is historically significant as it contains evidence of French exploration during the late 18th century.

Kamay Botany Bay National Park and Towra Point Nature Reserve are historically significant as the place where Joseph Banks&#x27;s and Daniel Solander&#x27;s unique botanical collection was sourced and later classified using the Linnaean system of classification. Kurnell Peninsula and Towra Point were the sites of the first scientific investigation of the east coast of Australia by British scientists.

The former Cable Station at La Perouse is significant for its role in telegraphic communication connecting New Zealand with Australia by sub-marine cable for the first time in 1876.

The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales&#x27;s history.

Traditional Aboriginal owners of the land and the current Aboriginal community have strong historical association with Kamay Botany Bay National Park and Towra Point Nature Reserve. The place is associated with the Gweagal warriors who resisted the arrival of arrival of Cook and the crew of the Endeavour.

Kamay Botany Bay National Park and Towra Point Nature Reserve is significant for its association with important European explorers and scientists and their life&#x27;s work. These include James Cook, Joseph Banks, Daniel Solander, de Lapérouse, &quot;Compte de&quot; Receveur and Joseph Lepaute Dagelet.

Kamay Botany Bay National Park has an important association with the First Fleet and Governor Arthur Phillip, first Governor of NSW. Governor Macquarie is also associated with the site as he commissioned the erection of the earliest known sandstone tower building in Australia, the Macquarie Watchtower. The place is also associated with French explorers under the command of Comte de Lapérouse who were the first Europeans to stay in the place for an extended period of 6 weeks.

The Kurnell Peninsula has an important association with one of the colony&#x27;s noted entrepreneurs and politicians, Thomas Holt. It also has historic association with members of the Aboriginal community who lived and worked with the first settlers on the Kurnell Peninsula and those who lived at La Perouse throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and whose descendants continue to live in the area.

The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

The cliffs edging the sea side entrance to Kamay Botany Bay National Park in both the northern and southern sections are of state heritage significance for their strong and dramatic landmark qualities that take on a symbolic aspect in relation to the historic events that took place after the Endeavour laid anchor inside Botany Bay and Cook stepped onto Dharawal land.

As well as the natural features of the site there are significant structures which have aesthetic value. The former cable station was designed by the noted colonial architect, James Barnet. The two-storey octagonal sandstone tower with castellated turret top built in circa1811, as a military guardhouse and lookout station, is a distinctive feature on the headland. The Doric column memorial to the Lapérouse expedition is another feature of the grouping on the northern headland. On the southern headland a commemorative obelisk marking Captain Cook&#x27;s landing site erected in to 1822 is another distinctive landmark.

The green peninsula of Towra Point Nature Reserve is an aesthetically appealing natural landscape amidst an otherwise industrial or suburban setting on the south side of Botany Bay.

The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

Both the northern and southern sections of the Botany Bay National Park are of state heritage significance for members of the local and statewide Aboriginal community as it is the site of the first meeting of Indigenous and European cultures. For many people who live locally and throughout the state it is the home of their ancestors, it is the place where their ancestors are buried and where they lived before Europeans arrived. It is also important to Aboriginal people as one of the earliest sites of resistance to British colonisation. The place is also an important site of cultural renewal as the story of the arrival of Cook and those that followed remains an important story within the Aboriginal community.

The Towra Point Keeping Place Aboriginal Place and the Dharawal Resting Place - Coast Hospital Cemetery repatriation sites are highly significant places to members of the La Perouse Local Aboriginal Land Council and the Dharawal Aboriginal people associated with Botany Bay. Visitation to these sites enables Dharawal people to maintain close connections to Country and ancestors.

Cook&#x27;s landing place is important to the European community as it marks the arrival of the British and the establishment of Britain&#x27;s southernmost colony. It is regarded as the birthplace of the European Australian Nation and the first meeting place of Aboriginal and British communities.

The northern shores of Botany Bay, the La Perouse peninsula, has a very special association for the French community in Australia and French people overseas as it was the last landfall of the noted French explorer, Jean-Francois Galaup de Lapérouse. The esteem the expedition is held in is marked by the Monument to Lapérouse commissioned in 1829 by the French and the annual ceremonies celebrating the visit of Lapérouse.

The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

The place is of state significance as a place of important technical achievement with the collecting efforts of Banks and Solander who during their visit in 1770 made the first important collection of fauna and flora from Australia. The Banks and Solander collection included many items that had never before been described and classified. The publication of &quot;Banks&#x27; Florilegium&quot;, a full colour edition which included illustrations and descriptions of the entire collection from the voyage in 1770, was the culmination of Banks&#x27;s and Solander&#x27;s work.

Previous archaeological excavations indicate that Kamay Botany Bay National Park and Towra Point Nature Reserve have significance for their high level of archaeological potential.

The La Perouse headland is significant as the place where the crew of Lapérouse&#x27;s expedition of exploration made camp was where Joseph Lapaute Dagelet set up his observatory and made the first astronomical observations in Australia.

The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

Kamay Botany Bay National Park is a unique place with state level rarity values as it is the place where the British colonisers first stepped ashore in Eastern Australia and the meeting place of Indigenous and white colonial Australia.

Kamay Botany Bay National Park and the Towra Point Nature Reserve wetlands contain rare remnant vegetation and fauna communities threatened and endangered species and vegetation communities such as: the Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub community, the littoral rainforest and Kurnell dune forest, a vast array of threatened and endangered bird species such as the little tern, frogs such as the green and gold bell frog and mammals like the grey headed flying fox. The park is an important link in the network of parks and reserves in NSW and plays an important role in conserving the biodiversity of the state.

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

Kamay Botany Bay National Park contains evidence of the intensive occupation by Indigenous people before the arrival and settlement by Europeans and is representative of the pre-contact Indigenous cultural landscape.

The remnant vegetation communities of Towra Point Nature Reserve and Kamay Botany Bay National Park are representative of the original vegetation communities which would have been evident from Sydney Cove to Port Hacking.

Kamay Botany Bay National Park is a representative example of a site with an extensive grouping of memorials commemorating highly significant historic events: the historic meeting of Indigenous and British cultures, the exploration of Captain James Cook, the important scientific collection work undertaken on the site by Banks and Solander, the noted French explorer Comte de Lapérouse and his party.

Towra Point Nature Reserve and Kamay Botany Bay National Park represent the role of parks and reserves in the conservation of biodiversity.

<text>The Bouddi National Park is a coastal national park that is located in the Central Coast region of New South Wales, in eastern Australia. The national park is situated northeast of Sydney. A section of the national park extends into the Tasman Sea, creating fully protected land, shore and marine habitats. The park contains one of the last mature temperate rainforests on the Central Coast, Fletchers Glen.

==History==
The Bouddi National Park was originally known as the &quot;Bouddi Natural Park&quot;. It received its name at the second meeting of the park trust held on 5 July 1936. Other names considered were &quot;Maitland Bay Park&quot;, &quot;Cape Three Points Reserve&quot; and &quot;Gerrinbombi Park&quot;. The reason for the choice was that &quot;Bouddi&quot; is the authenticated aboriginal name of the most conspicuous feature of the district and appears on maps as early as 1828. Bouddi is an indigenous word for the heart. The trust had been founded the year earlier to manage the reserve and had representation from the &quot;NSW Federation of Bushwalking Clubs&quot; and Erina Shire Council.

In 1967 the park, by then totalling about , was dedicated as a national park under the newly passed legislation and was renamed &quot;Bouddi State Park&quot;. Its management became the responsibility of the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, and soon afterwards the trust was reconstituted as an advisory committee. On 1 January 1974, the National Parks and Wildlife Act dispensed with the category of state parks and Bouddi was renamed &quot;Bouddi National Park&quot;.

==Geology and climate==
The rocks underlying the Bouddi peninsula is primarily Hawkesbury sandstone. The coastal areas contain several examples of tessellated pavements and laterite plateaus. There are also significant examples of the Terrigal Formation.

==Biology==
===Flora===
The Park contains three broad categories of vegetation: heath, &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; forest and grassy woodland.

===Fauna===
The park contains a wide diversity of animal life. A number of mammal species, including microbats, greater gliders and other marsupials are found in the Park. Reptile species present include lace monitors, green tree snakes and water dragons. Over 150 species of bird have been documented in the area.

The marine component of the Park has similarly high biodiversity. The marine extension of the park was found to have led to a 70% increase in fish numbers in the area than nearby comparators, and 60% higher numbers of species. A number of large mammals regularly frequent the area, including humpback whales, southern right whales and bottlenose and common dolphins. Leopard seals and fur seals have occasionally been seen on coastal rock platforms.

<text>The Bournda National Park is a protected area in New South Wales, Australia, managed as a national park by NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, and was established on 24 April 1992. It forms part of the Ulladulla to Merimbula Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for swift parrots.

==Description==
The park is 343 km south of Sydney near Tathra. Bournda National Park spans from Kianinny Bay, on the southern side of Tathra, south for about 13 km. There is a good walking track, along the coast for most of its length.

The park is host to three main bodies of water. Wallagoot Lake is a large salt water lake that last opened up to the ocean in June 2008. Bondi Lake is of ecological significance as it is the closest fresh water lake to the ocean in the region. Finally, Bournda Lagoon is a brackish (half salt water / half fresh water) lagoon that is periodically open to the ocean. The lagoon is a popular swimming spot for locals and campers alike. Good camping facilities are available at the Hobart Beach camp ground.

The park was once a State Recreation Area and became a National Park in 1992. Adjacent to the park is the Bournda Nature Reserve, which was established in 1972 and is 6,088 ha in size. Both areas are included in the management plan by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.

===Walking tracks===
* Hobart Beach to Bournda Lagoon – 2.6 km
* Hobart Beach to Scotts Bay – 1.3 km
* Hobart Beach to Tathra via the Kangarutha Track – 12.0 km
* Bournda Lagoon round trip via Bournda Island – 6.0 km

<text>Brisbane Water National Park is a national park on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia. The national park is situated north of Sydney and southwest of Gosford. It consists the Brisbane Water and Mooney Mooney Creek waterways.

The National Park includes the Lion Island and the Spectagle Island near the Pacific Ocean. Brisbane Water National Park features fertile valleys which runs along the northern side of the Hawkesbury River towards Brisbane Water and the Pacific Ocean. The national park has an area of and is inhabited by the Darkinjung people.

==Features==
The park has many pleasant and interesting walks that can vary from mild to rugged. One walk that can be easily accessed via public transport, is the walk to Pindar Cave on the escarpment above the Wondabyne railway station, which is a request-stop on the Central Coast railway line. The Great North Walk, that leads from Sydney to Newcastle, passes through the park.

The national park is bounded to the south by the Hawkesbury River; to the west by part of the Pacific Highway, part of the M1 Pacific Motorway, and the Peats Ridge Road; with the latter also forming the northern boundary; and to the east by the Brisbane Water, the Central Coast railway line, and urban areas. The Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge, part of the Central Coast Highway, part of the Pacific Highway and part of the M1 Motorway bisect various sections of the national park.

==Region Description==

Brisbane Water National Park is described as a ‘living space’ for plant and animal communities in the National Parks Plan of Management. The park is a sanctuary for plant and animal communities to adapt and migrate in the face of climate change. The size and shape of the park should allow adjustment in the Northwest and South for biological adjustment. The park is a system of reserves protecting the states significant waterways of the lower Hawkesbury River, Broken Bay and Brisbane Water. The park also protects a range of Aboriginal sites and extends the representation of rock art from the Sydney Basin in the National Park systems. The geology is mainly in the Hawksbury series of cross bedded quarts sandstone, conglomerates, and grey and red shales.

==Biology and Ecology==

The park covers enough area to provide critical nesting and breeding sites for several species whose territories range over surrounding rural and urban areas. For many of these species the park provides the only secure available land for them to find seclusion from human impacts. For many of these plant and animal species the park is the only available habitat which provides the necessary resources for their survival such as tree hollows. The main vegetation communities found in the park are low-open forests, low-open woodland, and open woodland accompanied by either a dry or moist understorey. Rainforest communities occur in sheltered sections of valleys and along streams. 20 vegetation communities are represented in the park, all of which are considered endangered under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. 5 are listed as critically endangered under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC). The critically endangered communities listed in the EPBC act in the park are: Blue Gum High Forest in the Sydney Basin Bioregion, Littoral Rainforest in the New South Wales North Coast, Lowland Rainforest in the NSW North Coast and Sydney Basin Bioregions, Shale Sandstone Transition Forest in the Sydney Basin Bioregion, and Western Sydney Dry Rainforest in the Sydney Basin Bioregion.

The Blue Gum High Forest is a tall open forest community where the Sydney blue gum (&quot;Eucalyptus saligna&quot;) dominates the canopy layer. Other tree species that occur in this community are: blackbutt (&quot;E. pilularis&quot;), forest oak (&quot;Allocasuarina torulosa&quot;), and Sydney red gum (&quot;Angophora costata&quot;). Species occurring in the shrub layer are ones adapted to moist habitats. Only around 4.5% of the Blue Gum High Forest remains, now occurring in small remnants. It only occurs in areas where rainfall is high and soil fertility is good. For this reason it can only occur in small sections which are suitable for growth. Understorey species rely on bird and mammal species to distribute seeds and this community does not cope well in fire events. The Blue Gum High Forest is known to occur in Brisbane Water National Park and is now reliant on national park status as protection from habitat degradation, as well as good park management with regards to invasive species control and fire regimes.

==Flora==

A number of areas in Brisbane Water National Park contain rare and endangered plants. It is likely that these remnant populations demonstrate the ways that environmental conditions have changed in the past few thousand years. In some cases these rare species are remnants of populations that would have been extensive before widespread clearing took place for urban and agricultural use. The park encompasses a wide variety of flora with 814 species recorded. The diversity of plant species and plant communities is reflective of variations in geology, soils, hydrology, aspect, and fire history. Ten of the recorded plant species are considered to be rare and several others are uncommon or restricted in their distribution. The park hosts a number of vulnerable and threatened species as listed under the EPBC act. Vulnerable species include: thick-leaf star-hair (&quot;Astrotricha crassifolia&quot;), Camfield&#x27;s stringybark (&quot;Eucalyptus camfieldii&quot;), Deane&#x27;s paperbark (&quot;Melaleuca deanei&quot;), and &quot;Grevillea shiressii&quot;. The endangered Somersby mintbush (&quot;Prostanthera junonis&quot;) is also present in the park. 
The donkey orchid (&quot;Diuris bracteata&quot;) has been recorded in the area in recent times after having been listed as extinct under the commonwealth status. The donkey orchid resides in dry sclerophyll woodland and forest with a predominantly grassy understorey. Recordings in the Gosford and Wyong areas are the only existing species known to survive.

The vulnerable Camfield stringybarks (&quot;Eucalyptus camfieldii&quot;) range in NSW has contracted and is now only found in small numbers isolated mainly to nationals parks surrounding Sydney. The species is either a mallee-like shrub or a tree up to 9 metres bearing heart shaped leaves as a juvenile. Too frequent or not frequent enough wildfire activity is a threat to its survival, where frequent fires impact its ability to grow seed capsules and infrequent fires result in competition from taller vegetation. The main threats to this species are: Competition from invasive non-native species and degradation of habitat from weeds, inappropriate or changed fire regimes including frequency, intensity, and timing, habitat loss and fragmentation from development, and low genetic diversity as a result of contracted population numbers.

The endangered Somersby mintbush (&quot;Prostanthera junonis&quot;) is only known to occur in the Somersby Plateau area in 9 locations after having been previously present in a broader range. The bush grows low with most of the branches growing along the ground to a maximum height of around 30 cm. Its flowers are pale mauve to almost white. Most of the remaining population are present in Brisbane Water National Park and face similar threats to Camfield&#x27;s Stringybark which are: habitat degradation, invasive weed competition, and inappropriate fire regimes.

==Fauna==

The allocation of land in the National Park has provided and conserved valuable habitat to a range of vulnerable and endangered species as listed under the EPBC act. In total 261 species of fauna have been recorded in the park. all of which are listed as protected by the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 (except invasive species). 26 native mammal species are known to occur in the park and 30 species of frog which represent 9 of the continent&#x27;s 27 genera have been recorded. 50 species of reptiles representing one-third of the continent&#x27;s reptile genera are also found in the park. 

Over 150 species of birds have been recorded. Habitat destruction and fragmentation has impacted many of the species, this is an example of the significance of preserved habitat which the park provides. A number of birds found in the park are considered rare in the Sydney bioregion due to lost habitat, these include: Collared sparrowhawk (&quot;Accipiter cirrhocephalus&quot;), Pacific baza (&quot;Aviceda subcristata&quot;), Lewin&#x27;s rail (&quot;Rallus pectoralis&quot;), Buff-banded rail (&quot;Rallus philippensis&quot;), Yellow-tailed black cockatoo (&quot;Calyptorhynchus funereus&quot;), Glossy black cockatoo (&quot;Calyptorhynchus lathami&quot;), Gang-gang cockatoo (&quot;Callocephalon fimbriatum&quot;), Powerful owl (&quot;Ninox strenua&quot;), Australian masked owl (&quot;Tyto novaehollandiae&quot;), and the Red-browed treecreeper (&quot;Climacteris erythrops&quot;).

The endangered swift parrot (&quot;Lathamus discolour&quot;) has been recorded in the park during their migration from Tasmania between March and October. This species returns to foraging sites depending on food availability and available habitat in tree hollows. The critically endangered regent honeyeater (&quot;Anthochaera Phrygia&quot;) has been sighted in the park. Regent honeyeater range has contracted significantly in recent times and they face a significantly high risk of extinction in the near future The regent honeyeater is a flagship species whose conservation benefits a wide variety of other threatened and vulnerable woodland fauna. Foraging non breeding flocks are recorded on the Central Coast every few years and rely on healthy woodland which is species rich for their survival.

Other migratory bird species known to visit the park are the white-throated needletail (&quot;Hirundapus caudacutus&quot;), The Caspian tern (&quot;Hydroprogne caspia&quot;), and the white-bellied sea-eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster). These seasonal bird species are protected under several migratory bird agreements with China, Korea, and Japan.

Other than birds, the following EPBC endangered species are known to occur in the park: giant burrowing frog (&quot;Heleioporus australiacus&quot;), green sea turtle (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;), The koala (&quot;Phascolarctos cinereus&quot;), which is now restricted in distribution on the Central Coast, spotted-tailed quoll (&quot;Dasyurus maculatus&quot;), lLong-nosed potoroo (&quot;Potorous tridactylus&quot;), grey-headed flying fox (&quot;Pteropus poliocephalus&quot;), large-eared pied bat (&quot;Chalinolobus dwyeri&quot;), and the New Holland mouse (&quot;Pseudomys novaehollandiae&quot;).

Rosenberg&#x27;s goanna (&quot;Varanus rosenbergi&quot;), eastern pygmy possum (&quot;Cercartetus nanus&quot;), and the squirrel glider (&quot;Petaurus norfolcensis&quot;) are species listed as vulnerable which inhabit the park. 

All of these species are listed as endangered and vulnerable on the EPBC threatened species list mainly due to habitat loss, fragmentation of suitable habitat, degradation of habitat such as removal of dead trees and logs, introduction of feral species, inappropriate fire regimes, and climate change. The spotted tail quoll (Dasyurus maculatus) is in serious decline due to habitat loss, competition from predators, and poisoning from humans. The quoll occupies a large home range meaning they require a lot of space for foraging, and is therefore mainly restricted to large reserves and national parks. The species require suitable den sites which can be tree and log hollows, rock outcrops, and caves. Habitat fragmentation and degradation are severe impacts for this species as smaller parcels of fragmented land do not provide the necessary habitat, rainfall, nesting sites, and prey, which the spotted tail quoll relies on for survival.

The koala (&quot;Phascolarctos cinereus&quot;) and the squirrel glider (&quot;Petaurus norfolcensis&quot;), are arboreal marsupials broadly distributed in Eastern Australian forests and woodlands. Arboreal marsupials rely on habitat which is influenced by the size and species of trees present, the soil nutrients, amount of rainfall, and climate. The squirrel glider and other glider species found in the park specifically rely on the shelter of tree hollows and on flowering Acacia and Banksia genus shrubs for food. Urban development, agriculture, and infrastructure is increasingly fragmenting the required habitat for these species and they are therefore more reliant on protected areas. Even species such as the Powerful Owl (&quot;Ninox strenua&quot;) that can tolerate some habitat fragmentation still rely on available tree hollows for nesting and the availability of prey. Forest dependent species such as the marsupial gliders and ground dwelling mammals are relied on for food by owl species, therefore reduction in the abundance of prey due to habitat fragmentation is an indirect impact on owls.

==Environmental Threats==

Brisbane Water National Park is vulnerable to various environmental threats. Introduced invasive feral animals are of particular concern, this includes foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), wild dogs (&quot;Canis familiaris&quot;), and cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;). Wild dogs and cats are of particular concern due to the proximity of the park to areas of highly urbanised land use. This makes the wild dog and cat issue particularly prevalent. Cats and wild dogs are significant predators because they interact with fauna in a number of ways, for instance predation, outcompeting natives for resources, and transmitting disease. This impacts the native fauna as wild dogs generally prey on large and medium species such as wallabies and possums, and cats prey on medium and small prey including reptiles and small mammals. These pests can cause local extinctions and are a real threat to species which are already vulnerable or endangered.

Invasive weeds are a threat to the natural processes within the park. The low fertility of the soil does not readily facilitate weed growth ), however once they become established they can quickly out compete native species and are a real threat to the vulnerable and endangered species and communities. Eroding soils from degradation and increased transport of sediment from nearby runoff can transport sediments and nutrients which encourages weed growth. An example of the significance of weed invasion is the previously mentioned Blue Gum High Forest and Somersby mintbush (&quot;Prostanthera junonis&quot;) which are susceptible to weed invasion. Pest species displace natives and alter the ecosystem functions which creates ongoing implications such as altered fire patterns and changed nutrient cycling. The proximity of urban dwellings to the national park allows weed seeds to be easily introduced on a regular basis, which means regular maintenance and monitoring is required to ensure invasive species are kept in control. The biggest threat from invasive weeds is the degradation of biological diversity and is therefore a major environmental threat within the park. Further environmental threats are present in that the park is boarded by intensive urban, industrial, and agricultural development. The larger streams which form part of the park have their headwaters and catchment areas outside the park boundary giving rise to major management issues. These management issues are largely due to altered natural processes such as sedimentation and nutrient alterations.

==Park Management==

The management of Brisbane Water National Park is by the NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service (NPWS), under the Office of Environment &amp; Heritage. Park management is vital in conserving biodiversity by offering physical protection to vulnerable and endangered wildlife. This refuge for Australian native plants, animals, and ecosystems allows research programs and conservation initiatives to be undertaken such as weeding and pest control programs to restore native habitats. Fire management strategies are developed in the balance of protecting life, Aboriginal sites, historical sites, and natural processes. The areas surrounding the national park on plateaus was easily settled, therefore the remaining area originally reserved for parkland was limited to remnant areas on the plateau and areas of the catchments in Mooney Mooney, Patonga, and Mullet Creeks, because these areas remained inaccessible for settlement, they are generally harder for access. The locations of settlements mean the national park is hemmed in on two sides by development. The threats to the park caused by intensive agricultural, urban, and industrial development on the boundaries and headwaters make the management of the park difficult, and are increasing over time with continual development proposals such as those on the Kariong and Somersby plateaus which are in various catchment areas of the park. The following are some of the other management issues in the park. Woy Woy refuse tip is an inholding within the park which is a particular management issue as it is within the Patonga Creek Catchment. Agricultural, industrial, and domestic runoff from surrounding developments have long term harmful impacts on aquatic plant communities. Weeds also spread down creek lines from runoff. Fire suppression and management trails need to be planned so potential impacts and erosion which leads to sedimentation of creeks is minimised. Dirt bikes and four wheel drive access to the park is not permitted. Physical damage to plants and soils occurs and erosion has further impacts. Their access is hard to manage as many possible entry points are available.

<text>Budawang National Park is a national park in New South Wales, Australia, located approximately southwest of Sydney and north of Batemans Bay. It contains part of the Budawang Mountain Range.

Budawang National Park is named after Mount Budawang. The mountain itself derives from the Aboriginal word &#x27;Buddawong&#x27;. The vantage point afforded by the mountain was originally used to make signal fires.

The Budawang National Park is largely isolated. Its terrain is steep and rugged. The park comprises high-elevation moist forests.

==Landscape==
Most of the Budawang National Park lies within the southern Budawang Range. This range is characterized by rugged terrain, steep slopes and deeply incised valleys.

==Wildlife==
Budawang National Park&#x27;s diverse landscape has created pockets of unique habitats where several plant and animal species survive.

===Plants===
The middle and high slopes of the hills in the park are covered in cool temperate rainforest. In the lower elevations, which are drained by small rivers and streams, the dominant vegetation is dry rainforest trees and ironwood.

===Animals===
The park supports good populations of swamp wallabies, greater gliders, and potoroos. Eastern grey kangaroos, common wombats, honeyeaters and white-throated tree creepers inhabit the open forest and woodland. Other notable bird species include green catbirds and lyrebirds.

<text>The Bundjalung National Park is a national park located on the north coast of New South Wales, Australia, north-east of Sydney. It protects an area of coastal plain, heathland and solitary beaches between the towns of Iluka and Evans Head.

The park features coffee rock formations that can be found on the beaches at its northern end.

==Background==
Along the Iluka peninsula coast at the southern end of the park are a number of closely spaced headlands that create small crescent shaped beaches of white sand. Each headland features rock platforms cut by waves and contain rock pools that are havens for intertidal marine life.

The park is named for the Bundjalung Aboriginal nation, the original occupiers of the land.

Facilities in the park include camping areas at Black Rocks (a nature-based camping area with minimal facilities, adjacent to Ten Mile Beach) and at Woody Head (which provides amenities including hot showers, cabins and a kiosk).

The park contains six picnic areas: Gummi Garra near Evans Head and Shark Bay, Old Ferry Crossing, Back Beach, Frazers Reef and Iluka Bluff on the Iluka Peninsula.

The north-eastern portion of the park contains an exclusion zone utilised by the RAAF as an active bombing range and public access is restricted. The bombing range has been in use since World War II as a training facility for target practice. Its existence predates the gazettal of the park and provides a mixed benefit in that it has preserved a large area that has been relatively untouched by human interference for many years.

Part of the national park was an original First Fleet grant and the park contains important historic and archaeological resources, including a homestead built in the 1820s, ruins of a
stone windmill which is thought to be the oldest industrial building in Australia, convict-built dry stone walls, and a range of other features which reflect changes in the place since the early nineteenth century. The national park also contains a number of Aboriginal sites which are of importance to our understanding of the Cattai area prior to European settlement.

The Cattai Homestead, which was constructed around 1820, and its curtilage is listed by the National Trust and the Australian Heritage Commission. The Hope Farm Mill on Hope Farm, which is also listed on the Register of the National Estate, was probably constructed around 1806 and is believed to be the oldest industrial site in Australia.

<text>Chaelundi National Park, a national park comprising , is located in the Northern Tablelands district of New South Wales, Australia.

==Features==
Chaelundi National Park is north-west of Dorrigo and Grafton, approximately by road north of Sydney.

Comprising of old-growth forest and of declared wilderness, the park creates a habitat for 187 (indigenous and non-indigenous) species according to the Atlas of NSW Wildlife.

The park was proclaimed in January 1997, on land formerly designated as a State-owned production forest.

===Litigation===
A series of cases were brought in the NSW Land and Environment Court between 1989 and 1991 by members of the North East Forest Alliance in order to protect the forest located near Dorrigo from continued logging. One key case concerned the interpretation of s.99 of the , which stated that it was an offence to &quot;take or kill any endangered fauna&quot;. Such were the habitat values of the forest that in &quot;Corkill v Forestry Commission&quot;, Justice Paul Stein referred to the old growth forest as a &quot;veritable forest dependent zoo&quot;. The ruling was that &quot;take&quot; included indirect taking by means of the habitat modification/destruction associated with logging:&quot;Corkill v Forestry Commission of New South Wales&quot; (1991) 73 LGRA 126. That decision went on appeal to the Court of Appeal, and the interpretation was upheld: &quot;Forestry Commission v Corkill&quot; (1991) 73 LGRA 247.

These legal cases were combined with an on-site blockade of logging work, the blockade being undertaken by experienced and inexperienced green activists and locals many of whom camped in the forest; using techniques such as chaining protesters inside concrete pipes and up tripods.

<text>Clyde River is a national park in south-eastern New South Wales (Australia) between Batemans Bay and Nelligen. It includes 9 km of river frontage to the Clyde River, bounded on three sides by the Clyde River and on the northeast by the Kings Highway. It was created from a part of Benandarah State Forest; in 2000 10.91 km2 of the state forest was set aside as a national park. The park forms part of the Ulladulla to Merimbula Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for swift parrots.

Primarily, this is the land of the Walbunja people.

<text>The Cocoparra National Park is a protected national park that is located in the Riverina region of New South Wales, in eastern Australia. The national park is situated southwest of Sydney and northeast of . The name of the park comes from the Aboriginal &quot;cocupara&quot;, or kookaburra.

==Features==
The park includes a prominent range of hills such as Bingar Mountain, above sea level and Brogden Mountain, above sea level, in an otherwise largely flat landscape. Adjoining the national park to the north is the Cocoparra Nature Reserve. The national park was gazetted in December 1969. The nature reserve was dedicated in 1963 with an area of . The Binya-Cocoparra area is classified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because of its relatively large population (of up to 50 individuals) of the near threatened painted honeyeater, as well as the diamond firetail.

The rugged, robust landscape of the park provides a large number of different habitats.

The climate is semi arid. The vegetation communities reflect this, with wattle, orchids, ironbark and blue-tinged cypress pines.

The geology comprises Upper Devonian sandstones, siltstones and conglomerates.

There are a number of day use (picnic) areas in the park and a campground at Woolshed Flat.

<text>The Conimbla National Park is a protected national park that is located in the Central West region of New South Wales in eastern Australia. The national park is situated approximately west of Sydney, northwest of and northeast of .

==Features==
The park is important for the conservation of a sample of the plant and animal communities of the central west, an area which has largely been cleared and developed for agriculture. The Conimbla National Park also provides habitat for several species of threatened fauna and conserves populations of a number of plant species and communities which are now uncommon or rare because of clearing.

The park contains very attractive scenery, including a number of clifflines, a small gorge and several waterfalls. These ranges and peaks are important landscape features in the district. As it is one of the few naturally vegetated areas remaining in the district the park has the potential to be a valuable educational and recreational resource for locals and tourists.

One of the more visible features of the national park is Mount Yambira, which with its wooded chains rises 500 metres above the plain, forming a &quot;bush island&quot; in the middle of arable land in the west.

<text>Conjola National Park covers 11,060 hectares and lies on the mid south coast of New South Wales, Australia, between Sussex Inlet and Lake Conjola, 165 km southwest of Sydney.

== Flora ==
Conjola National Park is home to 18 distinct plant communities including 4 that are endangered due to urban development on the East coast of Australia. The national park is listed as being a biodiversity hotspot containing 429 species although this number is likely to rise due to further surveying of the area. Of these species 5 are threatened they include the endangered Wilsonia rotundifolia, vulnerable Wilsonia backhousia, Syzygium paniculatum, Cryptostylis hunteriana and Galium australe which was believed to be extinct in NSW. A further 8 significant species occur in the park, along with Grevillea macleayana and Pultenaea villifera which are on the national register of rare or threatened Australian plants. &#x27;At least thirty-five terrestrial and epiphytic orchid species occur in the park.&#x27;

== Fauna ==
Due to the great diversity of the plant world, many species of birds and wild animals can be found here. Eastern grey kangaroos and echidnas are common, but the favourite resident of park visitors is the noisy yellow-tailed black cockatoo (&quot;Zanda funerea&quot;).

== Geology ==
The underlying geology of the park is mainly composed of the Permian Conjola formation, a series of sandstone and shale units. This is overlain by large areas of Wandrawandian Siltstone around Swan Lake. There is areas of sandstone that outcrop around Berringer Lake and West of the park. There is a sandstone shelf located approximately 30 cm under the surface of the water in Berringer lake that extenders approximately 1 metre under the surface before dropping to a depth of 8–15 metres.

== Aboriginal heritage ==
Conjola National Park has been home to both the Budawang and Yunin people for approximately 6000 years. Aboriginal artefacts in the area include rock shelters, midden and campsite. In the middens mussels and oysters can be found. Axe grinding grooves can be found in sandstone outcrops.

<text>Cottan-Bimbang is a national park in New South Wales, Australia, 443 km north of Sydney and 65 km south east of Walcha and was formerly a state forest. The Oxley Highway crosses the park south of Werrikimbe National Park. Myrtle Scrub Road is a 15-kilometre circuit in the west of the park that connects with the Oxley Highway.

==Flora and fauna==
This park is situated on the eastern escarpment with extensive tall old-growth eucalypt forest, rainforest, threatened frog species, yellow-bellied gliders (&quot;Petaurus australis&quot;) and koalas. &#x27;Cottan-bimbang&#x27; is the local Aboriginal word for the walking stick palm (&quot;Linospadix monostachya&quot;), which grows in the park&#x27;s temperate rainforests.

Blackberries (&quot;Rubus&quot;) are creating a serious weed problem in the park.

There is a barbecue area, picnic area and public toilets at Stockyard Creek on the Oxley Highway and a cleared area for picnics next to Cells River on Myrtle Scrub Road. There is a cleared area for camping at Maxwells Flat on the Causeway Road, and a long drop toilet.

<text>The Culgoa National Park is a protected national park that is located in the north-west region of New South Wales, in eastern Australia. The national park is located approximately northwest of Sydney. The nearest town is , away. The park&#x27;s northern boundary is defined by part of the state border between New South Wales and Queensland.

The Culgoa River flows through the national park.

The spirit of the history and culture of the Aboriginal people, who mostly worked as colonial pastoralists, can be felt here. The whole area of the park is full of relics of the pastoral and grazing industry of that time.

==Features==
The national park, with its impressive river red gums and expansive floodplains, is the landscape that is thought to be representative of the Australian outback. The iconic coolabah tree, a native species, covers large sections of the park. In fact, no other national park in New South Wales has an area larger than the Culgoa&#x27;s coolabah woodlands.

The park has numerous mammals, including the Common brushtail possum and Little pied bat (Chalinolobus picatus), a species of bat endemic to Australia.

The Culgoa National Park&#x27;s birds present an irresistible lure for birdwatchers, who can glimpse many of the park&#x27;s total of over 150 species. These include 10 species of honeyeaters and six of Australia&#x27;s woodswallows.

<text>Cunnawarra is a national park located in New South Wales, Australia, east of Armidale, off the Waterfall Way and north of Sydney. The Styx River Forest Way runs from the Point Lookout Road through Cunnawarra National Park to the Kempsey Road. The New England National Park adjoins the Cunnawarra National Park on the north-eastern boundary and the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park joins it on the southern corner.

The Park is part of the New England Group of the World Heritage Site Gondwana Rainforests of Australia inscribed in 1986 and added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2007.

Cunnawarra is home not only to the imposing eucalyptus trees (which are the tallest in NSW) but also to various endangered wildlife species. Here you can see glossy black cockatoos (&quot;Calyptorhynchus lathami&quot;), rufous scrub-birds (&quot;Atrichornis rufescens&quot;), powerful owls (&quot;Ninox strenua&quot;) and spotted-tailed quolls (&quot;Dasyurus maculatus&quot;).

<text>The Dharug National Park is a protected national park that is located in the Central Coast region of New South Wales, in eastern Australia. The national park is situated approximately north of the Sydney and west of .

The park contains the Great North Road, one of the eleven UNESCO World Heritagelisted Australian Convict Sites. These eleven sites present the story of the forced migration of convicts and the ideas and practices of punishment and reform of criminals during this time. The relatively intact Devine&#x27;s Hill and Finch&#x27;s Line sections of the Old Great North Road, approximately long and contained within the national park, were inscribed on the World Heritage register in July 2010.

==Location and features==
The park is bounded by the Yengo National Park, the Wisemans Ferry and Old Great North Roads, McPherson State Forest, private land along Mangrove Creek and the townships of and . The Popran National Park is located on the eastern bank of Mangrove Creek and the Marramarra National Park is located on the southern shore of the Hawkesbury River; making the Dharug National Park, when combined with adjoining parks, a virtually contiguous area of protected national park stretching from in the Hunter Region in the north to in the Hills District in the south.

The Dharug National Park lies within the Sydney Basin, a major structural unit of Permian and Triassic age (270-180 million years ago) consisting almost entirely of horizontally bedded sedimentary rocks. The park lies on the northern margin of the Hornsby Plateau; a subdivision of the Sydney Basin.

== Fauna ==
The park is full of birds and animals that you can meet during the tour. You will be greeted by satin bowerbirds, gang-gang cockatoos and green catbirds.

==Etymology==
The park derives its name from the indigenous Darug people, south of the Hawkesbury River, who are not the traditional custodians of the area. It is incorrectly named on the land of the traditional Darkinjung custodians.

<doc id="101022" wikidata="Q1165064" url="?curid=101022" title="Dooragan National Park">
<text>The Dooragan National Park is a national park on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales, Australia. The national park is situated near Laurieton, and is approximately northeast of Sydney.

== Three Brothers ==
The local aboriginal people tell a dreamtime story of three brothers of the Birpai tribe who were killed by a witch called Widjirriejuggi and were buried where the mountains stand. The youngest of the three was Dooragan, for whom the park is named.

By amazing coincidence, when Captain James Cook passed the area on 12 May 1770 he named the mountains &quot;Three Brothers&quot;, since &quot;these Hills bore some resemblance to each other&quot;. Cook had earlier (25 January 1769) written of the Three Brothers hills west of Cape St Diego, so perhaps he was inspired by them too.

North Brother Mountain (Dooragan) supports a wide range of vegetation communities – including some of the best examples of old growth blackbutt forest in the area and pockets of sub-tropical rainforest – that provide habitat for gliders, bats and koalas. The park has a weed problem with the spreading of lantana.

The mountain was made a timber reserve in 1892 and later called the Camden Haven State Forest. Portions of the mountain were logged but large sections were untouched due to the terrain. It was opened to the public in 1970 when a road to the summit was constructed. The steep windy road has now been sealed, but it is unsuitable for caravans. Viewing platforms, which have wheelchair access, offer good views up and down the coast. Picnic, barbecue and toilet facilities are available. There are walks of varying length and difficulty.

== Fauna ==
The park is inhabited by many species of birds, whose diversity cannot be seen at first glance. There are currawongs, kookaburras, cheeky magpies and many more.

<text>Dorrigo National Park is a national park in New South Wales, Australia, north of Sydney on Dome Road off the Waterfall Way, east of the town of Dorrigo.

==History==
Dorrigo National Park lies within Gumbaynggirr country and has great significance to the Gumbaynggir people.

The park is part of the New England Group of the World Heritage Site Gondwana Rainforests of Australia inscribed in 1986 and added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2007. The area protected by the park is recognised for its exceptional natural beauty with significant habitats of outstanding value to science and conservation.

Since 2019, the NSW Government is developing a new visitor centre called the Dorrigo Arc Rainforest Centre and a 46km Dorrigo Escarpment Great Walk, construction had not begun.

==Geography==
The park sits on a plateau, and thus, the large number of waterfalls in the area. Parts of the park are more mountainous, more towards the north, with the south only being so slightly hilly.

== Biology ==
As a rainforest, Dorrigo National Park has high biodiversity. There are approximately 30 mammals, 128 birds, and 44 reptiles and amphibians.

Marsupials such as the red-necked pademelon can be found there.

Its birdlife is especially of note, the rainforest is home to species such as the wompoo fruit dove, the regent bowerbird, and the superb lyrebird.

==Features==

One of the main entrances to the National Park is the Dorrigo Rainforest Centre and the adjoining Canopy Cafe. The Rainforest Centre is a major CERRA interpretation centre. The interactive display, &quot;The Rainforest Revealed&quot;, explains how the rainforest evolved and gives insights into the animal and plant species that live there.

Several tracks in the park allow hikers to view the park&#x27;s waterfalls and vistas to the coastal plain. A notable feature of the park is the Skywalk, an elevated walkway through and above the treetops, providing birdwatchers with an excellent view of local bird life.

<text>The Gardens of Stone National Park is a protected national park that is located in the Central Tablelands region of New South Wales in eastern Australia. The national park is situated northwest of Sydney, and northwest of . The national park draws its name from the natural stone pagodas within its boundaries.

The Gardens of Stone National Park is one of the eight protected areas that, in 2000, was inscribed to form part of the UNESCO World Heritagelisted Greater Blue Mountains Area. The national park forms part of the Great Dividing Range.

==Features and location==
The most prominent features of the park are the sandstone pagoda landscapes and cliffs and canyons. Limestone outcrops, karsts and elevated swamps are other unusual features.

The park is bounded on the west by the Castlereagh Highway; to the north by the Glen Davis Road; to the east by the Wollemi National Park; and to the south by the Newnes State Forest, the Wolgan Valley, and the Wolgan State Forest. The rural localities of , , and are located on the edge of the national park.

==History==
The Newnes Plateau region was proposed for conservation in 1932 as part of a Greater Blue Mountains National Park by the National Parks and Primitive Areas Council. Lobbying for protecting the area increased after the establishment of Wollemi National Park in 1979. The National Parks Association proposed its extension westwards in 1984, which developed into a detailed proposal of an park in 1993, which was ultimately successful. The Gardens of Stone National Park was established in 1994; however, the initial park only covered , omitting areas which contain coal deposits. It was later enlarged to . Environmentalist groups seek to protect more of the surrounding area, which includes pagodas, canyons, heathland and elevated swamps.

==Flora and fauna==
A total of 423 native plant species have been recorded in the park in 30 different plant communities. Most of the park is covered in open forest or woodland dominated by eucalypts. In the west of the park, there are ironbark (&quot;Eucalyptus fibrosa&quot; and &quot;E. crebra&quot;) and yellow box (&quot;Eucalyptus melliodora&quot;) woodlands that grow on clay loam and are a habitat for the rare regent honeyeater and turquoise parrot. There is white box (&quot;Eucalyptus albens&quot;) woodland in the southwest and scribbly gum (&quot;Eucalyptus rossii&quot; and &quot;E. sparsifolia&quot;) woodland on the park&#x27;s eastern borders.

The plant and animal communities of the pagoda formations are fragile and easily irreversibly damaged by human activity. Collection of bush rocks for gardens and landscaping removes habitat for reptiles.

<doc id="101030" wikidata="Q3006" url="?curid=101030" title="Pinneberg (district)">
<text>Pinneberg () is a district in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is bounded by (from the northwest and clockwise) the districts of Steinburg and Segeberg, the city (and state) of Hamburg and the state of Lower Saxony (district Stade). The island of Heligoland is also part of the district.

==History==

The district is roughly identical to the former county of Holstein-Pinneberg. It was established by the Prussian administration in 1867. Since then there has been a continuous loss of territory to the neighbouring cities of Altona (later itself a part of Hamburg), Hamburg and Norderstedt. The island of Heligoland, formerly a district by itself, joined the district in 1932.

==Geography==

The district is situated on the northern bank of the Elbe River. While Pinneberg is the smallest district within Schleswig-Holstein, it has the most inhabitants. Due to the growing Hamburg metropolitan area the population is still increasing. The district consists mainly of the northwestern suburbs of Hamburg. Although the district of Pinneberg is only connected to the sea through the Elbe, the archipelago of Heligoland became a part of this district in 1932.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays a fir tree inside a white nettle-leaf. The leaf is from the arms of the county of Holstein-Schauenburg. The tree symbolises the forestry in the district.

* Revesby Beach – the beach located on the Georges River is the most common and frequently used swimming spot for visitors to the park. The water way is a common passing for bull sharks so swimming in the deep waters is cautioned to visitors. 
* East Hills District Men&#x27;s Shed Association – The Men&#x27;s shed Association (AMSA) is a national organisation that supports local men, through activities of common interest; furniture making, motor repairs, bike restorations, and many other types of hands on activities. The East Hills District Men&#x27;s Shed Association Inc, are located in the Georges River National Park and specialise in engineering, woodwork, stained glass making, and leather work, taking part in many volunteer community-based work, and maintenance.
* Ridge Walking Track – is a total distance of 3.2 kilometres (1.6 km in and out). It is estimated to take 30 minutes to an hour to complete the circuit.
* Yeramba Lagoon Loop Walking Track – it is a 1.8 kilometre trail. 100 species of birds have been recorded in the area, and up to 15 different bird species are present at one time, making this trail most popular for birdwatchers. Many bird species are found in this area of the park due to the abundance of freshwater wetlands and lakes found here. It takes roughly 30 minutes to 1 hour to complete the trail.
* Burrawang Reach Picnic Area – located adjacent to Little Salt Pan creek and Morgan&#x27;s creek, this spot is most popular for recreational activities such as barbecuing and picnics. Situated not far off the shoreline are moorings for temporary boat parking near the shore.
* Morgan Creeks Picnic Area – most popular spot for water activities such as fishing, jet skiing and boating, as there is a dual width boat ramp for visitors to use. It is also the closest picnic area to the car park.

== Geography, Flora, Fauna ==

* Geography – The Georges River National Park lies upon a thick bed of Hawkesbury sandstone. In other sections of the park at Sandy Point, Mittagong sandstone is more common. Mittagong sandstone is younger much finer grained sandstone compared to Hawkesbury sandstone. The 96 km long saltwater Georges River runs through the centre of the park, named and honoured after King George the III. The parks highest point of elevation is at Mill Creek, 100 metres above sea level, with an average elevation of 60 metres. Additionally, the national park receives an average annual rainfall of 850-900 millimetres (mm), 435 mm less than Sydneys annual rainfall of 1309 mm.
* Flora – The river side predominantly consist of mangrove swamps, occupying 24 hectares on the national park, and salt marshes occupying 11 hectares of the national park. However, aerial photo analysis suggest between 1966 and 1998 unauthorised vehicles, BMX bikes, and motorised dirt bikes have reduced and declined these occupied areas of mangrove swamps and salt marches. The most common vegetation found throughout the park is Sydney Hinterland Exposed Sandstone Woodland, covering 293 hectares, characterised by eucalyptus trees 10–25 metres tall and small sclerophyll shrub. However, other floral habitats can be found in the national park as well, such as, Littoral Rainforests, Sydney Coastal Heaths, Coastal Freshwater Lagoons, and Coastal Floodplain Wetlands. Prioritised tree species that are under threat identified in the park are swamp mahogany and red gum. These are flowering tree species which nurture and feed animals species such as the grey-headed flying fox and little lorikeets. They are under-threat due to high public disturbance, and are not widely dispersed within the park. Moreover, there has been a reduction in the numbers of hollow-bearing trees with in the park, which shelter and allow for the breeding of Sittella bird species.
*Fauna – Roughly 248 native vertebrate species have been recorded in the Georges River National Park compromising of animals ranging from amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, both introduced and native. Out of the 248 species found in the park 20 of those species are threatened under the Threatened Species Conservation Act, 1995 and 8 species listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, 1999, including animals such as the Green and Golden Bell frog and the blue billed duck. In total sixteen frog species have been recorded in the national park, the most common being the eastern dwarf tree frog and Tylers tree frog. Thirty two locally endemic reptile species can be found in the park, one freshwater turtle species, twenty two types of lizards (four geckoes, thirteen skinks, three dragons, two goannas), and nine snakes. The most abundant reptile species is the dark-flecked garden sunskink. Moreover, 180 species of native bird can be observed, 59 being waterbird species. Finally, twenty species of mammals are locally native to the park, the most frequently occurring being the common ringtail and brushtail possums, the swamp wallaby and the grey-headed flying-fox. A breeding population of Koalas live in the park, however are listed at as threatened. It is further noted that 59% of mammals are nocturnal microbats, such as the little forest bat, and the chocolate wattled bat. Eighteen invasive species threaten the parks native fauna, with the common fox being the most wide spread and devastating, impacting the long-nosed bandicoot population as well as the swamp wallaby.
== Management Strategies ==

* Park management – The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Act, 1974 evokes that all 870 National Parks and reserves located in NSW, should have a plan of management to sustain the natural ecology of the parks for future generations. Georges River National Park plan of management, 1994, objectively aims too; protect and preserve the natural beauty of the park, whilst conserving wildlife, and historical Aboriginal sites. Encouraging appropriate recreational activities and aiding in visitor education. Actions taken to adhere to these goals are; erosion and weed control on areas surrounding Henry Lawson drive, rehabilitation of disturbed areas, increased research and surveys of the area, accounting for introduced flora and fauna species and their eventual eradication, with the re-introduction of endemic species. Furthermore, swimming in the national park was a popular past time activity, but due to shark attacks swimmers were confined to netted areas, and with the increase in pollution in 1960 all swimming in the national park was prohibited. The plan of management does not permit for the re-opening of netted swimming areas out of fears the water is still far too polluted, 90% due to stormwater run off. The Georges River Keeper program are seeking to clean the river system, collecting on average 100 tonnes of litter, compromising of 68,000 plastic bottles, annually. Since the establishment of the Georges River Keeper program, they have witnessed a significant decrease in river pollution from 2015 to 2017, evident in their annual report. The NSW National Parks Wildlife Service seek to re-open netted swimming areas, however far more rehabilitation needs to be conducted.
* Fire management – The National Parks and Wildlife Act, 1974 also states that all National Parks in NSW should have a plan of management for natural disasters such as Bushfires. In 1985 80% of the Georges River National Park burnt due to a wild fire, therefore establishing the park as a threatened fire area. Since then strict park fire management strategies have been emplaced, most recently the, Georges River Park Fire Management Strategy, 2018. This document is a legal requirement, that outlines operational guidelines for prescribed burning and wildfires. The fire management plan list operations to combat wildfires, such as; Aerial water bombing, Aerial Ignition, Back burning, Containment Lines, Fire Suppression Chemicals, Earth moving equipment, Visitor Management in case of fire, and Rehabilitation methods for burnt areas. The plan additionally maps out the current vegetation status of the whole National Park bush lands. Listing the areas as other vulnerable, frequently burnt, long unburnt or unknown. The management strategy also names and highlights threatened Fauna, which fire services should be aware, for example the Hieraaetus morphnoides (little eagle), and Ninox strenua (Powerful Owl), as well as their habitats (hollow bearing trees).

== Park History ==

*Modern History — Following WW2, the Georges River area and Bankstown City industrial industries accounted for 20% of all the factories located in Sydney. With the increase of industrialisation, pollution became a problem, as of 1971 the Georges river became the second most toxic body of water in all of Sydney. The continual increase in industrial pollution encouraged locals to take action, advocating for the protection and conservation of threatened ecological niches along the river. As a result, between 1961 and 1967 the Georges River National Park was established, and a trust group was founded, in order to manage and protect the park lands. During this period most of the funding for the park came from sand mine leases. However, after the introduction of the 1967 National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Georges River National Park was downgraded and listed as a state park, also known as a &#x27;nature reserve&#x27;. Reasons for this was that the park did not meet certain qualities of having spacious land areas. Finally, in 1992 the park was re-declared a National Park and increased in size from 173 hectares in 1961, to 514 in 2020.
*Indigenous History – The Georges River is known to the Indigenous people as the Tucoerah River, evidence of past indigenous activity is present in the national park, including aboriginal shelters, rock engravings, and axe grinding sites. Upon European settlement of Sydney, the Dharug and Dharawal people of the Georges River were forced up stream by colonist to the now located Georges River National Park. However, fast industrial growth in this area between 1900 and 1930, lead to many native families being forcefully evicted off their land. It wasn&#x27;t until 1930 where an indigenous activist, Joe Anderson, appealed for Salt Pan Creek to become a place of refuge for indigenous people. Salt Pan Creek located near Padstow in the Georges River National Park, became a place of shelter for many indigenous political fighters, such as Jack Patten, Bert Grovers, Ted Thomas, Bill Onus, and Jacko Campbel. Additionally, Salt Pan Creek was the site for many aboriginal families to seek refuge from the Australian Government between 1910 and 1970, during the stolen generations. The park and water ways allowed aboriginal people to hunt and gather food, practice indigenous associated rituals, and stay connected to the dreaming thus the land.

<text>Gibraltar Range is a national park located in northeastern New South Wales, Australia. It is situated 79 kilometres (49 mi) northeast of Glen Innes and north of Sydney. The Park is part of the Washpool and Gibraltar Range area, which is designated as a World Heritage Site Gondwana Rainforests of Australia. This area was inscribed in 1986 and was later added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2007.

==Birds==
The Gibraltar Range a national park encompasses an area of 366-square-kilometre (141 sq mi) and is recognised as the Gibraltar Range Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it is a block of highland forest that supports one of only five remaining populations of the vulnerable rufous scrub-bird, as well as significant populations of green catbirds, Australian logrunners, paradise riflebirds and pale-yellow robins.

<doc id="101034" wikidata="Q1537463" url="?curid=101034" title="Goobang National Park">
<text>Goobang is a national park located in New South Wales, Australia, northwest of Sydney. It protects the largest remnant forest and woodland in the central west region of the state, where interior and coastal New South Wales flora and fauna species overlap. Originally named Herveys Range by John Oxley in 1817, the area was reserved in 1897 as state forest because of its importance as a timber resource, and was designated a national park in 1995.

The park contains a camping ground and a hiking trail, Burrabadine Peak Walking Track, a 3.6 km round trip moderate hike.

==Climate==

Goobang National Park is in a temperate to semi-arid zone experiencing hot summers and cool winters with temperatures ranging from in winter and in summer. The heaviest rain fall is in the summer and can range from on the east side of the ranges to west of the ranges.

==Flora==

There are 459 species recorded in the park, several that are threatened. &quot;Tylophora linearis&quot; is listed as vulnerable according to the TCS ACT 1995 and endangered according to the EPBC ACT 1999. &quot;Eriostemon ericifolius&quot; is vulnerable based on TCS ACT 1995 and &quot;Astrotricha linearis&quot; only known record west of the Great Dividing Range. &quot;Pomaderris queeslandica&quot; endangered TSC ACT 1995 and &quot;Philotheca ericifoia&quot; vulnerable EPBC ACT 1999.

There are 135 ecological communities in the South West Slope bioregion, most are considered poorly protected.(4) There are 11 ecological communities in the park, five of which are only protected at Goobang. These include red stringybark (&quot;Eucalyptus macrorhyncha&quot;) woodland found on siliceous hillslopes of the Hervey Range.
Red stringybark (&quot;Eucalyptus macrorhyncha&quot;), long leaved box (&quot;Eucalyptus goniocalyx&quot;) black cypress pine (&quot;Callitris endicher&quot;), hummock grass (&quot;Triodia scariosa&quot;), shrubby low woodland found on siliceous volcanic and sedimentary ranges.
Red ironbark (&quot;Eucalyptus fibrosa&quot;) in association with black cypress (&quot;Callitris endlicheri&quot;) shrubby woodland found on shallow sandy soils derived from sandstone. 
Red ironbark (&quot;Eucalyptus fibrosa&quot;), red stringybark (&quot;Eucalyptus macrorhyncha&quot;) tumbledown gum (&quot;Eucalyptus dealbata&quot;) heathland found on siliceous ridges and scribbly gum (&quot;Eucalyptus rosii&quot;) dominated open forest in association with black cypress pine and red ironbark.

A further four communities that are protected in Goobang are considered to be of significance.
Mugga ironbark (&quot;Eucalyptus sideroxylon&quot;), black cypress, red stringybark, Blakely&#x27;s red gum (&quot;Eucalyptus blakelyi&quot;) and red ironbark woodland which are found on hillslopes and in valleys on the ranges. 
Buloke (&quot;Allocasuarina leuhnannii&quot;) and white cypress pine (&quot;Callitris glaucophylla&quot;) woodlandis found on alkaline soils. 
Riparian Blakely&#x27;s red gum, apple box (&quot;Eucalyptus bridesana&quot;), yellow box (&quot;Eucalyptus melliodora&quot;) and occasionally inland grey box (&quot;Eucalyptus macrocarpa&quot;), with shrub, sedge and grass tall open forest in valleys. 
White box (&quot;Eucalyptus albens&quot;), with black cypress and red gum (&quot;Eucalyptus polyanthemos&quot;) shrubby woodlands in the hills.

==Fire==
Fires are an intrinsic feature of the Australian bush, to ensure continual biodiversity prescribed burns are carried out at the appropriate times within the park. Wildfires at Goobang have occurred due to dry lightning strikes in the hot summer months. There have been 52 wildfires recorded since 1942.

==Fauna==

There are 31 species of reptiles, 14 species of frogs and 31 species of mammals recorded in the park including echidnas, wallaby, kangaroos, possums and bats as well as exotics such as rabbits, cats, foxes, goats, sheep and dogs. Threatened species include carpet python (&quot;Morelia spilotes&quot;), Sloane&#x27;s froglet (&quot;Crinia sloanei&quot;), koala (&quot;Phascolarctos cinereus&quot;), brush tailed rock wallaby (&quot;Petrogale pencicllata&quot;), grey-headed flying-fox (&quot;Pteropus poliocephalus&quot;), yellow-bellied sheathtail bat (&quot;Saccolaimus flaviventris&quot;), Corben&#x27;s long eared bat (&quot;Nyetophilus corbeni&quot;) and New Holland mouse (&quot;Pseudomys novaehollandiae&quot;).

==Avifauna==

It is becoming evident that due to clearing of eucalyptus forests that woodland birds are on the decline. Birds of significance that have been sighted at Goobang are varied sittella (&quot;Daphoenositta chrysoptera&quot;) painted honeyeater (&quot;Grantiella picta&quot;), black-chinned honeyeater (&quot;Melithreptus gularis&quot;), regent honeyeater (&quot;Anthochaera phrygia&quot;), scarlet robin (&quot;Petroica boodang&quot;), flame robin (&quot;Petrocia phoenice&quot;), hooded robin (&quot;Melanodryas cucullata&quot;), Gilbert&#x27;s whistler (&quot;Pachycephala inornata&quot;), diamond firetail (&quot;Emblema guttata&quot;) grey-crowned babbler (&quot;Pomatostomus temporalis&quot;), speckled warbler (&quot;Chthonicola saggitatus&quot;), brown treecreeper (&quot;Climacteris picumnus&quot;), glossy black cockatoo (&quot;Calyptorhynchus lathami&quot;), superb parrot (&quot;Polytellis swainsonii&quot;), little lorikeet (&quot;Glossopsitta pusilla&quot;), turquoise parrot (&quot;Neophema pulchella&quot;), spotted harrier (&quot;Circus assimilis&quot;), barking owl (&quot;Ninox connivens&quot;), black falcon (&quot;Falco subniger&quot;), and little eagle (&quot;Heiraaetus morphnoides&quot;).

==Environmental threats==

===Feral animals===

Feral animals pose a huge threat to native species due to predation, disease and competition. Feral cats for example have been responsible for reduced numbers and extinction of small mammals and birds.) Rabbits pose a threat to the survival of tree seedlings competition with native herbivores.

===Environmental weeds===

Weeds such as blackberry are significant as far as causing havoc within the natural environment forming large thickets blocking creeks suppressing native ground covers and providing a hiding spot for feral animals such as rabbits. Exotic grasses, pastures and weeds have replaced native undergrowth in most of the scattered white box communities.

===Agriculture practices===

Grazing in and around remnant woodlands. Clearing of native vegetation that might act as connective corridors between the park and any other patchy native landscapes.

===Human – induced climate change===

Species that require specialized niches and or cannot disperse and effectively colonize suitable habitat will be affected if this current trend of human induced climate change continues. It is estimated that 52% of the already declining population of frogs and 35% of birds will be affected. Koalas are listed by the IUCN as one of the top 10 species to become extinct. Koala populations are already at risk because of habitat modification and chlamydia. Increasing levels will affect the nutrient availability of eucalyptus leaves further weakening koala populations, increased frequency of droughts and bushfire will force koalas to seek new habitats, exposing them to the dangers of predation and injury from traffic.

<text>The Commendation Medal is a mid-level United States military decoration presented for sustained acts of heroism or meritorious service. Each branch of the United States Armed Forces issues its own version of the Commendation Medal, with a fifth version existing for acts of joint military service performed under the Department of Defense.

The Commendation Medal was originally only a service ribbon and was first awarded by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard in 1943. An Army Commendation Ribbon followed in 1945 and in 1949 the Navy, Coast Guard, and Army Commendation ribbons were renamed the &quot;Commendation Ribbon with Metal Pendant&quot;. By 1960 the Commendation Ribbons had been authorized as full medals and were subsequently referred to as Commendation Medals.

Additional awards of the Army and Air and Space Commendation Medals are denoted by bronze and silver oak leaf clusters. The Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal and Coast Guard Commendation Medal are authorized gold and silver 5/16 inch stars to denote additional awards. The Operational Distinguishing Device (&quot;O&quot; device) is authorized for wear on the Coast Guard Commendation Medal upon approval of the awarding authority. Order of Precedence is following the Air Medal but before the Prisoner of War Medal and all campaign medals. Each of the military services also awards separate Achievement Medals which are below the Commendation Medals in precedence.
== Variants ==
For valorous actions in direct contact with an enemy but of a lesser degree than required for the award of the Bronze Star Medal, a Commendation Medal with &quot;V&quot; Device or Combat &quot;V&quot; (Navy/Marine Corps/Coast Guard) is awarded; the &quot;V&quot; device may be authorized for wear on the service and suspension ribbon of the medal to denote valor. On January 7, 2016 The &quot;C&quot; Device or Combat &quot;C&quot; was created and may be authorized for wear on the service and suspension ribbon of the Commendation Medal to distinguish an award for meritorious service or achievement under the most arduous combat conditions (while the Soldier/Sailor/Marine was personally exposed to hostile action or in an area where other Servicemembers were actively engaged). A Commendation Medal with Combat Device is unofficially named the &quot;Combat Commendation&quot; and is often considered to be a higher level form of the Commendation Medal, regardless of the Awarding Branch. Retroactive award of the &quot;C&quot; device is not approved for medals awarded before January 7, 2016.
==Commendation Medals by service and branch==

===Joint Service===
The Joint Service Commendation Medal (JSCM) was authorized on June 25, 1963, and is awarded in the name of the Secretary of Defense to members of the Armed Forces of the United States who, after January 1, 1963, distinguished themselves by meritorious achievement or service in a joint duty capacity.

This award is intended for senior service on a joint military staff and is senior in precedence to service-specific Commendation Medals. As such, it is worn above the service Commendation Medals on a military uniform.

; Devices
* Oak leaf cluster (for subsequent awards)
* &quot;V&quot; Device (for valorous actions in direct contact with an enemy)
===Army===
The Army Commendation Medal is awarded to any member of the Armed Forces of the United States other than General Officers who, while serving in any capacity with the U.S. Army after December 6, 1941, distinguished themselves by heroism, meritorious achievement or meritorious service. The medal may be awarded to a member of another branch of the U.S. Armed Forces or of a friendly foreign nation who, after June 1, 1962, distinguishes themselves by an act of heroism, extraordinary achievement, or significant meritorious service which has been of mutual benefit to the friendly nation and the United States.

;Criteria and appearance
The Army Commendation Medal is awarded to American and foreign military personnel in the grade of O-6 (Colonel in the U.S. Army) and below who have performed noteworthy service in any capacity with the United States Army. Qualifying service for the award of the medal can be for distinctive meritorious achievement and service, acts of courage involving no voluntary risk of life, or sustained meritorious performance of duty. Approval of the award must be made by an officer in the grade of Colonel (O-6) or higher.

The medallion of the Army Commendation Medal is a bronze hexagon, 1 inches wide. On the medallion is an American bald eagle with wings spread horizontally, grasping in its talons three crossed arrows. On its breast is a shield paly of thirteen pieces and a chief. The reverse bears a panel for naming between the words &quot;FOR MILITARY&quot; above and &quot;MERIT&quot; below, all placed above a laurel sprig. The ribbon is 1 inches wide primarily of myrtle green. It is edged in white and in the center are five thin white stripes spaced equally apart.

; Devices 
* Oak leaf cluster (for subsequent awards)
* &quot;V&quot; Device (for valorous actions in direct contact with an enemy)
* &quot;C&quot; Device (for meritorious service or achievement under combat conditions. Unofficially called the Combat Commendation. Retroactive Awards are not authorized for medals awarded before January 7, 2016)
* &quot;R&quot; Device (for direct and immediate impact on combat operations from a remote location)
===Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard===

After World War I, the Department of the Navy authorized the Navy Commendation Star, a ribbon device to be placed on the World War I Victory Medal. The inch silver star was identical to the Army Citation Star, but not comparable, as the latter recognized &quot;gallantry in action&quot;, while the Navy Commendation Star denoted those who had been cited and commended for performance of duty by the Secretary of the Navy.

An independent Navy Commendation Ribbon was established in November 1943. On March 22, 1950, a metal pendant (of the same design as the pendant of the Army Commendation Medal) was authorized and the Commendation Ribbon was renamed the Navy Commendation Ribbon with Metal Pendant. This award was re-designated as the Navy Commendation Medal in September 1960, and renamed the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal in 1994. This decoration was previously awarded only by flag rank operational commanders, requiring the signature of an admiral or general officer in the grade of O-7, allowing interpretation of the criteria for which the medal may be awarded. Authority to award this decoration was later expanded to captains and colonels in the grade of O-6 currently holding operational command as a commodore, carrier air wing commander or commanding officer.

Recipient members of the U.S. Marine Corps have always been issued the Navy&#x27;s commendation medal and there is not a separate commendation medal intended only for Marines. This lack of difference was recognized on August 19, 1994, when Secretary of the Navy John Howard Dalton changed the name of the Navy Commendation Medal to the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal.

The U.S. Coast Guard awards a separate Coast Guard Commendation Medal, with a ribbon similar in design to that of its Navy and Marine Corps counterpart. Initially established as the Coast Guard Commendation Ribbon in 1947, it was redesignated as the Coast Guard Commendation Medal in 1959. Criteria for its award has paralleled that of the Navy and Marine Corps.

;Devices
* inch star, Combat &quot;V&quot;, and Operational Distinguishing Device (Coast Guard) 

==== Notable recipients ====
* Richard Nixon: US President

===Air and Space Forces===

The Department of the Air Force began issuing its own Air Force Commendation Medal in 1958 with additional awards denoted by oak leaf clusters. Prior to this time, USAF recipients received the Army Commendation Medal. It was not until 1996 that the &quot;V&quot; device was authorized on the Air Force Commendation Medal; prior to 1996, there was not a valor distinction in effect for the Air Force Commendation Medal. On January 7, 2016, the &quot;C&quot; device and &quot;R&quot; device was authorized on the Air Force Commendation Medal as well. For USAF enlisted personnel, the Air Force Commendation Medal is worth three points under the Air Force enlisted promotion system.

On November 16, 2020, it was renamed the Air and Space Commendation Medal (&quot;ASCOM&quot;) by the Secretary of the Air Force.

;Criteria and appearance
The Air and Space Commendation Medal is awarded to both American and foreign military personnel of any service branch in the U.S. military grade of O-6 and below, the NATO grade of OF-5 and below, or of any other Allied or Coalition nation in the grade of Colonel or equivalent or below, or the naval grade of Captain or equivalent or below, who have performed noteworthy service in any capacity with the United States Air Force or United States Space Force. Qualifying service for the award of the medal can be for distinctive meritorious achievement and service, acts of courage involving no voluntary risk of life, or sustained meritorious performance of duty. Approval of the award must be made by an officer in the grade of Colonel or higher.

The Air and Space Commendation Medal is a bronze hexagonal medallion. On the medallion is a shield surmounted by an eagle superimposed over clouds. On the shield bears a pair of flyer&#x27;s wings and a vertical baton with an eagle&#x27;s claw at either end; behind the shield are eight lightning bolts. The design on the shield is derived from the Seal of the Department of the Air Force. The ribbon of the Air and Space Commendation Medal is golden yellow with blue edges. In the center are three bands of blue, the outer stripes are thin with the center stripe being wider.

; Devices
* Oak leaf cluster (for subsequent awards)
* &quot;V&quot; device (for valorous actions in direct contact with an enemy)
* &quot;C&quot; device (for meritorious service in direct contact with an enemy)
* &quot;R&quot; device (for employment of a remote weapon system during military operations)

<doc id="101038" wikidata="Q1489775" url="?curid=101038" title="Gulaga National Park">
<text>Gulaga National Park is a national park on the south coast of New South Wales, Australia, about south of Narooma. The park is dominated by Gulaga, also known as Mount Gulaga (formerly Mount Dromedary). The former Wallaga Lake National Park, Goura Nature Reserve, and Mount Dromedary Flora Reserve were combined to form this park in 2001. The park features the southernmost subtropical rainforest in New South Wales. 

==History==
Gulaga was an active volcano more than 60 million years ago.

In 2001, as part of the Southern Comprehensive Regional Forest Agreement and at the request of Yuin people, Gulaga National Park was created out of the existing Wallaga Lake National Park, Goura Nature Reserve, and Mt Dromedary Flora Reserve.

On 6 May 2006 the freehold titles to Gulaga and Biamanga National Parks were handed back to the Yuin people, the traditional owners of the land, by the New South Wales Government, represented by then New South Wales Environment Minister Bob Debus. Freehold title of Gulaga National Park is held in trust by land councils for the Aboriginal owners by Merrimans and Wagonga Local Aboriginal Lands Councils, while that of Biamanga will be held in trust by Merrimans and Bega Local Aboriginal Lands Councils.

==Geography==
The mountain is currently high, surrounded by lakes, mining tracks, rainforest and the countryside. The park is in area. It forms part of the Ulladulla to Merimbula Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for swift parrots.

Wallaga Lake, the largest lake in southern NSW, lies within the park. 

Bermagui is about south of the park.

<doc id="101040" wikidata="Q643478" url="?curid=101040" title="Guy Fawkes River National Park">
<text>Guy Fawkes River National Park, a national park comprising , is located on the eastern edge of the New England Tablelands and the western edge of the Dorrigo Plateau, in north eastern New South Wales, Australia.

Access to the national park via Waterfall Way, is near Ebor, south-west of Dorrigo and north-east of Armidale. The national park is approximately north of Sydney. Additional access points to more remote parts of the national park are via the Armidale-Grafton Road, via Marengo Road at Hernani, Sheepstation Creek Road at Dundurrabin, Ellis Road and Boundary Creek Road south of Nymboida; or from the Old Grafton-Glen Innes Road, via Chaelundi Road at Dalmorton. From the west, the national park is accessible via Wards Mistake.

Guy Fawkes River National Park has over 40 different vegetation communities, 28 threatened plant species, 24 threatened fauna species and significant areas of old-growth forest protected within the park. The Guy Fawkes River plunges off the Northern Tablelands at the Ebor Falls. There are spectacular examples of valley and rugged river gorges including the deeply incised Guy Fawkes River Valley along the line of an ancient fault through the park. The rugged gorges of the Aberfoyle, Sara and Henry rivers also run through the park.

==Features==
Wild horses have lived in this park since the 1930s. In October 2000, over 600 horses in the Guy Fawkes River National Park were shot and killed from a helicopter during a controversial cull by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service. In response to public outcry, the Minister for the Environment, Mr Bob Debus, commissioned a study into the heritage value of horses in the park and indicated that, should the horses be found to have genuine heritage significance, they would be humanely removed from the park so that they can be managed properly in another location by people with an interest in their heritage value. In February 2002, the final report by the Heritage Working Party found that these horses had significant historical, military and cultural value. They are direct descendants of Australia&#x27;s wartime cavalry horses, known as Walers, and are the only group of Australian wild horse to have proven heritage value. Since the campaign began to remove horses from there over 400 have been passively trapped, taken from the park, and 200 of these have been found a home elsewhere. The Guy Fawkes Heritage Horse Association (GFHHA) takes possession of horses passively removed from the GFRNP and offer them for sale to the public, they also manage the horses to maintain their inherent characteristics and to preserve the unique genetics of these wild horses. A formal register and Stud Book has been established for these purposes. The GFHHA also actively promotes the GF horse versatility by sponsoring classes held at local Ag Shows and encouraging horse owners to participate in all disciplines.

In the 1970s the Bicentennial National Trail was plotted to run along the western side of Guy Fawkes River on what is a travelling stock route.

<text>Hat Head is a national park on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales, Australia, north-east of Sydney. It lies within the Hastings-Macleay Important Bird Area. Within the park is the eponymous village of Hat Head, with about 320 inhabitants.

==Geography==
===Location===
Hat Head National Park is located on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales near South West Rocks and Kempsey. The park consists of beaches, sand dunes, rocky headlands, rainforest and wetlands. The average altitude is eight metres.

==History==
For the Dunghutti people some parts of the park remain a significant place as of their traditional land. The different areas of the park and the sea provided a rich source of food like fish and shellfish. The park is culturally important to Aboriginal people as it contains ceremonial grounds, burial sites, shell middens and campsites.

==Biodiversity==
Hat Head National Park is rich with birdlife such as kookaburra, black swans, egrets, herons, fantails, and honeyeaters. Also hawks, falcons or eagles like white-bellied sea eagle soaring above the cliffs. Wildlife at Hat Head includes black sheoak, grass trees, glossy black cockatoo, red-necked and swamp wallabies as well as eastern grey kangaroos, sugar gliders, grey-headed flying fox and short-beaked echidna. 
The regent skipper (butterfly) is only found in Hat Head National Park and Limeburners Creek National Park.

==Leisure==
Several walking tracks, fishing and whale watching can be done or just relax at the rocky headlands. Birdwatchers can look for black swans and spoonbills in the park&#x27;s wetlands, hawks and eagles soaring above beach cliffs and shorebirds like curlews and plovers around the beach.

<doc id="101042" wikidata="Q948585" url="?curid=101042" title="Heathcote National Park">
<text>Heathcote National Park is a protected national park that is located in the southern area of Sydney, New South Wales in eastern Australia, and is situated on Dharawal country. The national park is situated approximately southwest of the Sydney central business district, west of the Illawarra railway line, the Princes Highway and Motorway, and the suburbs of and .

==Geography==
The park consists of 2,679 hectares of woodland, predominantly dry schlerophyll forest on the ridges and low heath in the wetter areas. The Hawkesbury sandstone has been carved up by various watercourses like Heathcote Creek, Kingfisher Creek and Myuna Creek, creating deep valleys. The Hawkesbury sandstone has created a sandy, infertile soil that is typical of the Sydney region.

The main walking track is the Bullawarring Track, which stretches from Waterfall to Heathcote. It largely follows the valley of Heathcote Creek, the main watercourse in the park, as well as utilizing a maintenance road that leads from Woronora Dam to Heathcote Road.

It is bounded by Holsworthy and Pleasure Point to the north, Heathcote and Lucas Heights to the east, the Greater Western Sydney region to the west (which include the suburbs of Glenfield, Macquarie Fields and Campbelltown), and Helensburgh to the south in the Illawarra.

==History==
Before European settlement, the Dharawal people, an Aboriginal Australian people, lived in the area. They left their mark at a number of known sites, which include shield trees along the Bullawarring Track and charcoal drawings along Myuna Creek. In addition, a number of Europeans lived in rough huts in the park during the Great Depression, leaving behind meagre ruins at places like Myuna Creek.

In the early 1930s, The Sydney Bushwalkers and the Mountain Trails Club of New South Wales had a lease on of land in the area, and were probably responsible for the creation of some of the early tracks and camp sites. This was the beginning of Heathcote National Park, which eventually grew to over two thousand hectares.

==Features==

===Landscape===
The park consists of a deeply dissected Hawkesbury sandstone plateau, part of the Woronora Plateau The creek gorges include Heathcote Creek, a tributary of the Georges River. The sandstone was formed 200 million years ago, and periods of uplift began about 94 million years ago. Each period of uplift caused stream erosion, which cut more deeply into the plateau surface. Heathcote Creek cascades down a number of rock pools and small waterfalls to the Woronora River at the northern end of the park.

===Flora===

The ridges and drier slopes are covered in forest dominated by angophoras and eucalypts such as bloodwood, greygum, Sydney peppermint, and scribbly gum. Grass-trees are common. Low heath growth consists of shrubs, including ti trees, banksias, hakeas, and waxflowers. Gymea lilies and forest oaks grow on the moister slopes. Blackbutts and grevilleas grow in the Heathcote Creek Valley.

===Fauna===
Sugar gliders, ring tail possums, and possibly eastern pygmy possums inhabit both Mirang Creek and Minda Gully. Swamp wallabies are also present. Honeyeaters are often seen, as well as superb lyrebirds. Fish, eels and crayfish are commonly found in the creeks.

<text>The Kanangra-Boyd National Park is a protected national park that is located in the Central Tablelands region, west of the Southern Highlands and Macarthur regions, in New South Wales, in eastern Australia. The national park is situated approximately south-west of Sydney and is contiguous with the Blue Mountains National Park and the Nattai National Park. The park was established in 1969.

The Kanangra-Boyd National Park is one of the eight protected areas that, in 2000, was inscribed to form part of the UNESCO World Heritagelisted Greater Blue Mountains Area. The Kanangra-Boyd National Park is the most southwesterly of the eight protected areas within the World Heritage Site. The national park forms part of the Great Dividing Range.

Notable features of the national park include the Thurat Spires, Kanangra Walls, Mount Colong, and three waterfall systems – the Kalang, the twotiered drop Kanangara and the Morong falls. The park also features a series of karst landforms that can be explored by those with caving experience.

The movie &quot;Jedda&quot; was filmed in the Kanangra Walls area in 1954.

==Features and location==


Kanangra-Boyd National Park is composed of two land units — the elevated, gently undulating Boyd Plateau and the area of creeks, rivers, gorges and ridges into which the plateau falls away. The plateau is traversed by the Kanangra Walls Road and can be accessed either from Oberon or Jenolan Caves. The road leads to Kanangra Walls. There are several well known landmarks in the park, such as Mount Cloudmaker, Kanangra Walls and the Thurat Spires. The word &quot;Kanangra&quot; is generally held to be a corruption of &quot;Gundangura&quot; and was called Thurat for some time.

The national park is bounded to the north by open farmland; to the east by the Coxs River, the Blue Mountains National Park and the Kowmung River; to the southeast by the Yerranderie State Conservation Area; to the south by the Nattai National Park and the Wombeyan Caves Road; to the southwest by the Blue Mountains National Park; and to the west by the Kowmung River, the Jenolan Karst Conservation Reserve, and open farmland and extensive state forests that surround the town of . The Abercrombie River National Park is situated a short distance, further southwest.

===Geology===
The Kanangra-Boyd Wilderness is among the largest and most rugged wilderness areas in New South Wales. Situated to the south of in the Blue Mountains and the Kanangra-Boyd National Parks, this folded belt or &quot;Rim Rock&quot; area is markedly different from the Permo-Triassic sandstone dominated landforms which comprise the rest of the Blue Mountains. There are isolated residual cappings of Permian sandstone in a few places but here the Palaeozoic basement rocks, which are elsewhere buried well below the Permo-Triassic Measures, are on the surface as high land. Rock types include quartzite, diorite, Devonian rhyolites, rhyo-dacites, Silurian phyllites, slates, siltstones and tuff limestones. The Boyd Plateau comprises a dome of Devonian granite intruded into Devonian quartzites and sedimentaries. There are also intrusive igneous rocks from the Carboniferous period. Kanangra Tops at the south-eastern end of the Plateau is one of the Permian outliers. Its fringing fault scarp – Kanangra Walls – comprises Permian sedimentaries of the Capertee Group which rests unconformably on a Devonian Lambie Group Basement. Nearby Kanangra Gorge is cut deep in rocks of the Lambie Group, and is one of Australia&#x27;s deepest gorges. Cloudmaker and Guouogang are eroded remnants of Ordovician quartzite. Further east, in the Coxs River area, is the large Kanimbla granite batholith, emplaced during the Carboniferous period. Colong Caves is another outstanding feature of the area. The main Upper Silurian limestone belt, in the Jenolan River valley to the north-west, is thick, long and located in a valley deep. This karst topography, created by the Jenolan and its tributaries, is one of the least understood in Australia.

===Flora===
The complex geology, climate, fire regime, and topography has enabled a wide variety of ecosystems to develop. Eucalypt forest with western plain species, such as yellow box and white box, are found in areas of rainshadow. Forests of mountain ash are found on well drained soils and Blaxland&#x27;s stringybark where soil is poor. red spotted gum, Blakely&#x27;s red gum, red stringybark and forest oak are also found. Kurrajong trees are found in abundance where limestone outcrops occur, and in sheltered gullies rainforest species (including red cedar) and blue gum are found. On the Boyd Plateau, the misty mountain forests of brown barrel, messmate, ribbon gum, black sally, snow gum and mallee predominate. High altitude areas subject to strong winds generally support heath and closed scrub communities. In areas of impeded drainage, various swamps occur, dominated by sedges and scrubs such as &quot;Leptospermum&quot; and &quot;Baeckea&quot; species.

About 1,000 flowering plant species occur in the Blue Mountains, in some 40 plant communities. There are over 45 rare or endangered plant species in the wilderness. A unique form of tall open forest occurs in the Kedumba Valley, dominated by Camden white gum, an endangered species limited to these populations.

===Fauna===
The Blue Mountains National Park contains 46 species of mammals, including 27 marsupials and two monotremes. Over 200 birds and 98 reptile species have been recorded. Several species listed on Schedules 1 and 2 of the are found in the Wilderness Area including: The powerful owl (&quot;Ninox strenua&quot;), squirrel glider (&quot;Petaurus norfolcensis&quot;), yellow-bellied glider (&quot;Petaurus volans&quot;), tiger quoll (&quot;Dasyurus maculatus&quot;), and brush-tailed rock wallaby (&quot;Petrogale penicillata&quot;). A species of velvet worm (&quot;Euperipatoides kanangrensis&quot;) has been found on the Boyd Plateau.

==Bushwalking==

There are several walking tracks and other sites in the park, these include the:
* Lookout Walk the easiest and wheelchair accessible, this ten-minute route along well-formed tracks leads to the first lookout which overlooks the gorges of Kanangra Creek and beyond to the high tops of Mt Cloudmaker and the Blue Mountains escarpment, which presents a spectacular vista. The second overlooks rugged ravines at the head of the gorges and Kanangra Falls;
* Waterfall Walk accessible from the Lookout Walk, this route leads down into a gully where the Kalang Falls splash into a pool; and
* Plateau Walk turns off before the main lookout and leads into the Kanangra Wilderness and onto the expansive heath-covered Kanangra Tops Plateau. It is possible to walk continuously from this walk to Katoomba and Narrow Neck.

Camping is available on the banks of Morong Creek, at the Boyd River campground, located on Kanangra Road.

<doc id="101047" wikidata="Q1165427" url="?curid=101047" title="Kings Plains National Park">
<text>Kings Plains is a national park in New South Wales, Australia, 48 km from Inverell, 50 km from Glen Innes and 478 km north of Sydney.

==History==
Kings Plains was founded in January 1988 and was made a national park to preserve and protect the array of wild animals, plants and the Kings Plains creek with its many water features and found in 1988.

==Land features==
Kings Plains National Park is not widely known to people for the land, people mostly enjoy the array of water features joining the Kings Plains creek from non-drying pools to rapids to waterfalls, which leads to a gorge. The land itself is mostly made up of sandy soils with shrub. The soil is more fertile around the creek.

==Vegetation==
Some vegetation in the Kings Plains woodland includes iron-barks, cypress pine, yellow box, stringy-barks, eucalyptus trees, and apple box. Among the shrubs are rare species such as the grey guinea flower, folded leaf waxflower and Rodd&#x27;s star-hair. During spring the park&#x27;s wildflowers are at their most colourful.

==Wildlife==
Amongst the large variety of wildlife are eastern grey kangaroos, wallaroos, wallabies and koalas which live in the park near water and fertile soils. Also the rare brush-tail wallaby has been in the park. Platypus can be seen along the creek, but some of their habitat above the falls is considered fragile. In the area, 82 bird species have been recorded, including eastern and crimson rosellas, king parrots, yellow-tailed black cockatoos, currawongs, wattle birds and many species of honeyeaters. There are also the endangered glossy black cockatoos, turquoise parrots and regent honeyeaters. In and around Kings Plains Creek the straw-necked ibis can be found and high above &quot;birds of prey&quot; such as the wedge-tailed eagle and the peregrine falcon are seen.

==Activities==
The main attraction of Kings Plains National Park is bushwalking along the creek to Kings Plains Falls is seen as an enjoyable trip of about 2.5 hours. The creek banks also make a good attraction. Kings Plains is not well known but I see this is a getaway from the insanity of being crowded in a boring trailer park. The park offers walks, camping, picnic areas and the old style non-flush toilets.

<text>Koreelah is a national park in New South Wales, Australia, 631 km north of Sydney. The park is part of the Scenic Rim Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance in the conservation of several species of threatened birds.

==Description==
The main feature is the gorge just south west of the campsite. At the head of the gorge is a deep water hole surrounded by four metre cliffs that can be dived from. There are bigger waterfalls downstream but no access to the main gorge from the north without ropes. There is some algae in the water if there has not been recent rain.

This is a wonderful place to relax and enjoy nature, and the company will make you platypus, koalas, sugar gliders, brush-tailed rock wallabies and glossy black cockatoos.

==Facilities==
There is a campsite signed west of White Swamp Road, roughly 10 km north of Old Koreelah (which is on the Mount Lindsay Highway). It has a compost toilet and some barbecues, although the grass and weeds are rather long since cattle were evicted about 1999.

<doc id="101050" wikidata="Q1755161" url="?curid=101050" title="Kosciuszko National Park">
<text>The Kosciuszko National Park ( ) is a national park and contains mainland Australia&#x27;s highest peak, Mount Kosciuszko, for which it is named, and Cabramurra, the highest town in Australia. Its borders contain a mix of rugged mountains and wilderness, characterised by an alpine climate, which makes it popular with recreational skiers and bushwalkers.

The park is located in the southeastern corner of New South Wales, southwest of Sydney, and is contiguous with the Alpine National Park in Victoria to the south, and the Namadgi National Park in the Australian Capital Territory to the northeast. The larger towns of Cooma, Tumut and Jindabyne lie just outside and service the park.

The waters of the Snowy River, the Murray River, the Murrumbidgee River, and the Gungarlin River all rise in this park.

Other notable peaks in the park include Gungartan, Mount Jagungal, Bimberi Peak and Mount Townsend.

On 7 November 2008, the park was added to the Australian National Heritage List as one of eleven areas constituting the Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves.

==History==

Multiple Aboriginal groups in the southern part of NSW gathered in the Australian Alps Bioregion in the summer on an annual pilgrimage to the Bogong and Snowy Mountains. Here, the men participated in a feast of bogong moths (&quot;Agrotis infusa&quot;) that were found on the rocky outcrops of the mountains.

The area was explored by Europeans in 1835, and in 1840, Edmund Strzelecki ascended Mount Kosciuszko and renamed it for Polish patriot and military leader Tadeusz Kościuszko. High-country stockmen followed, using the Snowy Mountains for grazing during the summer months. Banjo Paterson&#x27;s poem The Man From Snowy River recalls this era. The cattle graziers have left a legacy of mountain huts scattered across the area. Today these huts are maintained by the National Parks and Wildlife Service or volunteer organisations like the Kosciuszko Huts Association. In the 19th century, gold was mined on the high plains near Kiandra. At its height, this community had a population of about 4,000 people, and ran 14 hotels. It was here that Skiing in Australia commenced around 1861. Since the last resident left in 1974, Kiandra has become a ghost town of ruins and abandoned diggings. In the 20th century, the focus of Skiing in New South Wales shifted south closer to the Kosciuszko Main Range.

The Kosciuszko National Park came into existence as the National Chase Snowy Mountains on 5 December 1906. In April 1944, following the passage of the Kosciusko State Park Act, the Kosciusko State Park was proclaimed. It then became the Kosciuszko National Park in 1967. The name was misspelt as Kosciusko until 1997.

The construction of the Snowy Mountains Scheme between 1949 and 1974 saw much of the area explored, brought improvements to roads and resulted in the construction of several dams and tunnels across the park in one of the world&#x27;s largest engineering achievements.

In December 2024, bushwalker Hadi Nazar went missing in the park. He was lost for 14 days, surviving on berries, water from creeks and two muesli bars found in a hut.

== Heritage listings ==
Kosciuszko National Park has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Currango Homestead

==Climate==
The higher regions of the park experience an alpine climate which is unusual on mainland Australia. However, only the peaks of the main range are subject to consistent heavy winter snow. The climate station at Charlotte Pass recorded
Australia&#x27;s lowest temperature of on 28 June 1994.

==Glaciation==

During the last ice age, which peaked about 20,000 years ago in the Pleistocene epoch, the highest peaks of the main range near Mount Kosciuszko experienced a climate which favoured the formation of glaciers, evidence of which can still be seen today. Cirques moraines, tarn lakes, roche moutonnées and other glacial features can all be seen in the area. Lake Cootapatamba, which was formed by an ice spilling from Mount Kosciuszko&#x27;s southern flank, is the highest lake on the Australian mainland. Lake Albina, Club Lake, Blue Lake, and Hedley Tarn also have glacial origins.

There is some disagreement as to exactly how widespread Pleistocene glaciation was on the main range, and little or no evidence from earlier glacial periods exists. The &#x27;David Moraine&#x27;, a one-kilometre-long ridge running across Spencers Creek valley seems to indicate a larger glacier existed in this area at some time, however the glacial origin of this feature is disputed.

There is evidence of periglacial activity in the area. Solifluction appears to have created terraces on the northwest flank of Mount Northcote. Frost heave is also a significant agent of soil erosion in the Kosciuszko Area.

The park has been experiencing a decline in snow depth since the 1950s.

==Ecology==
The Kosciuszko National Park covers a variety of climatic regions which support several distinct ecosystems.

That which is most closely identified with the park, the alpine area above the tree line, is one of the most fragile and covers the smallest area. This area is a patchwork of alpine heaths, herbfields, feldmarks, bogs and fens. The windswept feldmark ecotope is endemic to the alpine region, and covers a mere . It is most vulnerable to the wandering footsteps of unmindful tourists.

Nine separate wilderness zones have been identified in the latest management scheme. These include the Indi, Byadbo, Pilot, Jagungal, Bogong Peaks, Goobarragandra, Western Falls, Bramina and Bimberi wilderness areas.

===Fauna===
Many rare or threatened plant and animal species occur within the boundaries of the park.

The park is home to one of Australia&#x27;s most threatened species: the corroboree frog. The endangered mountain pygmy possum and the more common dusky antechinus are located in the high country of the park.

There are also significant populations of feral animals in the park, including brumbies or wild horses. Park authorities have coordinated their culling and relocation, leading to public controversy over how to reduce their numbers. The actual number of horses within the park is also difficult to ascertain with estimates ranging from 1,700 in 2008 increasing by 300 each year, 7,679 in 2009, and from 2,500 to 14,000 in 2013–2014. In 2016 the population was estimated to be 6,000. By 2019, this number was found to have more than doubled to 25,000. A 2020 survey placed the number at 14,380. Since the resumption of aerial shooting in Kosciuszko National Park, a total of 5,539 feral horses have been culled. In addition, 427 horses have been removed using other methods such as trapping, rehoming, and ground shooting. According to the latest population surveys conducted in October 2023, it is estimated that there are still approximately 17,000 feral horses in the park.

In June 2021, Federal environment minister Sussan Ley wrote to the NSW environment minister Matt Kean saying she planned to introduce regulation under federal environmental laws to protect the park, because the state was failing in its obligation to do so. A management plan for the wild horses was released on 24 November 2021. By June 2027 numbers are planned to be culled down to 3,000.

===Flora===
Much of the park is dominated by alpine woodlands, characterised by the snow gum. Montane and wet sclerophyll forest also occur across the ranges, supporting large stands of alpine ash and mountain gum. In the southern Byadbo wilderness area, dry sclerophyll and wattle forests predominate. Amongst the many different native trees in the park, the large Chinese elm has become naturalised.

Much of the tree cover in the lower sections of the park was seriously burned in bushfires in 2003. Fires are a natural feature of the park ecosystem, but it will take some time for the region to return to its pre 2003 condition.

==Recreational uses==
=== Winter ===
The mountains are typically covered by metre-deep snow for up to four months of the year. The ski resorts of Thredbo, Selwyn snowfields, Perisher and Charlotte Pass lie within the park. The electric rack railway, called the Skitube Alpine Railway, connects the Alpine Way to the Perisher Valley.

=== Summer ===
The 655 kilometre Australian Alps Walking Track crosses almost the length of the park. Many thousands of people make the walk to Mount Kosciuszko during the summer. It is 9 kilometres from Charlotte Pass, or 6 kilometres from the Thredbo chairlift. Camping is permitted anywhere in the park except within sight of a road or near a watercourse. The lighting of fires is severely restricted in higher altitudes.

Mountain biking is allowed on all management trails outside of wilderness areas, and on a small number within them: Grey Mare Trail, Round Mountain Trail, Valentine Trail, Hellhole Creek Trail, Cascade Trail, Ingegoodbee Trail and Nine Mile Trail.

Canoeing and swimming in the rivers and lakes are popular in the warmer weather. The rivers and dams are stocked with trout from nearby hatcheries. Seasonal trout fishing is allowed after a permit is obtained. Other attractions include the whitewater rafting, trail riding, Yarrangobilly Caves, Cooleman Caves, Tin Mine Falls, Australia&#x27;s highest waterfall and Valentine Falls. Guided tours are conducted through several caves in the karst region of Yarrangobilly. Other tours are also available.

Sawpit Creek has a major campground with facilities for caravans and cabins available for rent.

==The Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Scheme==

The Snowy River originates in the park and flows south to Victoria. Many tunnels, dams, generators and other parts of the Snowy Mountains Scheme hydro-electric system are located within the park, including the Tantangara Reservoir and Snowy 2.0 Pumped Storage Power Station.

The Snowy Scheme, constructed between 1949 and 1974, is a hydroelectricity and irrigation complex consisting of sixteen major dams; seven power stations; a pumping station; and 225 kilometres of tunnels, pipelines and aqueducts. The chief engineer was Sir William Hudson. It is the largest engineering project undertaken in Australia. An 8 km powerline is planned through the area.

<doc id="101052" wikidata="Q1322496" url="?curid=101052" title="Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park">
<text>Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park is a national park on the northern side of Sydney in New South Wales, Australia. The park is north of the Sydney central business district and generally comprises the land east of the M1 Pacific Motorway, south of the Hawkesbury River, west of Pittwater and north of Mona Vale Road. It includes Barrenjoey Headland on the eastern side of Pittwater.

Ku-ring-gai Chase is a popular tourist destination, known for its scenic setting on the Hawkesbury River and Pittwater, significant plant and animal communities, Aboriginal sites and European historic places. Picnic, boating, and fishing facilities can be found throughout the park. There are many walking tracks in Ku-ring-gai Chase. The villages of Cottage Point, Appletree Bay, Elvina Bay, Lovett Bay, Coasters Retreat, Great Mackerel Beach and Bobbin Head are located within the park boundaries.

The park was declared in 1894, and is the third oldest national park in Australia. The park is managed by the NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service and was added to the Australian National Heritage List in December 2006.

The park gets its name from the Guringai Aboriginal people who were long thought to be the traditional owners of the area. However, more contemporary research suggests that this was not the case.

==Geology==

Ku-ring-gai Chase is part of the Hornsby Plateau, a massive block of sandstone tilting upwards to the north. The park comprises a plateau with an elevation of generally 150–200 m above sea level. Between 250 and 200 million years ago, sand silt and mud was deposited by rivers across flood plains. These formed the shales, flagstones and sandstones of the Narrabeen Group that outcrop along the foreshores and ridges. Higher areas of the park are underlain with pink, white and orange layers of Hawkesbury Sandstone that contain small beds of shale. Wianamatta Group shale is present in the higher points of the park. The park&#x27;s terraced landscape is due to the horizontal arrangement of these sediment layers.

Other rock types in the park are less common. Soils derived from the Narrabeen group of shales are around the eastern shore of the Lambert Peninsula, particularly around Elvina Bay and Lovett Bay. These richer soils provide for a vegetation type different from that of the sandy ridge top soils, providing for forests of spotted gums (Corymbia maculata) with forest oaks as a secondary layer. Eroded remnants of volcanic dykes occur including at Resolution Picnic Area at West Head and Campbells Crater near Cowan, which provide for forests of Sydney blue gum (Eucalyptus saligna).

More recent volcanic activity has forced small intrusions of igneous rock into the sandstone. A band of dolerite runs across the West Head peninsula near White Horse Beach, providing fertile soils for a distinct group of plants. The Smith&#x27;s Creek area has intrusions of breccia.

The plateau is divided into separate sections by the steep valleys of Cowan Creek, Coal and Candle Creek, and Smiths Creek. These &quot;flooded&quot; or &quot;drowned&quot; valleys, knowns as rias, were eroded into the sandstone much deeper than the current sea level during the glacial phases of the Pleistocene ice age. When the ice caps melted about 10,000 years ago, the sea levels rose and flooded the valleys of the park, and separated Lion and Scotland islands from the mainland. The tributaries of Pittwater and Cowan Creek became bays and inlets along and extended shoreline.

The dominant rock type is Hawkesbury Sandstone which determines the topography and the vegetation in the sandy soils. Sandstone cliffs, rocky and outcrops, and worn caves are common throughout the park.

Indigenous people engraved the flat sandstone outcrops.

Tessellated pavements are found in the park whereby regular chequered patterns in the stone form along fault lines and lines of weakness.

The park&#x27;s highest point is 246 m at Willunga Trig near West Head Road which runs along the ridge of the Lambert Peninsula.

==History==
===Pre-European history===

The name Ku-ring-gai (also spelled Kuringgai, Kuring-gai, Guringai, Kuriggai) () is an ethnonym referring to (a) an hypothesis regarding an aggregation of Indigenous Australian peoples occupying the territory between the southern borders of the Gamilaraay and the area around Sydney (b) perhaps an historical people with its own distinctive language, located in part of that territory, or (c) people of Aboriginal origin who identify themselves as descending from the original peoples denoted by (a) or (b) and who call themselves Guringai.

Little about the original inhabitants was recorded by Europeans at contact and their communities were soon destroyed through disease and conflict with European settlers.

The national park contains extensive evidence of Aboriginal occupation of the area prior to European contact, across more than 800 sites in the park. These include rock engravings, cave drawings, occupation sites, paintings and stencils, axe grinding grooves and middens providing significant evidence of the way of life of the Guringai people.

===Park history===
In 1788, the first year of English settlement of the Sydney area, Governor Phillip and a small party explored Borken Bay and the Hawkesbury River, but seeking agricultural land, they showed little interest in the steep and stony landscapes.

It was previously underdeveloped by early settlers due to poor accessibility and low soil fertility, except for some of the more fertile ridgetops. The area&#x27;s Sydney Blue Gum, Blackbutt, Turpentine, and Coachwood was extracted in small quantities, but Red Cedar was heavily extracted. Sawmills were established in the 1830s, including at the upper reaches of Cowan Creek where Duffy&#x27;s Wharf was built to transport logs.

The Pacific Highway and Main Northern railway line built along the ridgetop forming the park&#x27;s current western border provided access to Cowan Creek along which pioneers settled. 40 hectares at Gerard Point, now Church Point, were granted to James Terry of Gordon.

Following almost 40 years of lobbying from a local citizen, Eccleston Du Faur, to establish a &quot;National Park for North Sydney&quot;, approximately 13,500 hectares, including not only land areas but also most of Cowan Water, was set aside in 1894 as Ku-ring-gai Chase as a conservation area, and placed under the care, control and management of trustees. Du Faur was a surveyor and engineer by profession, and his interests included science, exploration, natural history and the arts. Upon the gazetting of the gazetting of the park, du Faur was appointed Managing Trustee and during his 10-year tenure, he developed walking trails and a road to Bobbin Head, which is now a fire trail.

Bobbin Head Inn, picnic shelters, and boat shed concessions were established to raise much needed funds for park management. Picnic areas were created with the reclamation of mud flats at Appletree Bay, Bobbin Head, Illawong Bay, and Akuna Bay between 1910 and 1940.

The area around West Head had been held privately until it was added to the park in 1951. In 1918, owners of a 640 hectare lot in Commodore Heights lobbied for a road to be pushed through from the south. A 1927 prospectus proposed a community of 2,500 residences with a country club, casino, golf course, and hotel, however, the plans did not eventuate due to the Great Depression.

Ku-ring-gai Chase became a national park with the proclamation of the National Parks and Wildlife Act in 1967. It is the third oldest national park in Australia, with the Royal National Park being the oldest. Additions to the park have made it 14,882 hectares in size. The park is managed by the NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service and was added to the Australian National Heritage List in December 2006. The term &quot;chase&quot; indicates it was an area of natural bush not enclosed by fences. Ku-ring-gai Chase is also officially classed as a suburb by the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales.

The television series, &quot;Skippy the Bush Kangaroo&quot; was shot in northern Sydney at Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park and the adjacent Waratah Park. Bushfires ravaged the park in January 1994.

A seaplane on its way to Sydney Harbour crashed into Jerusalem Bay shortly after takeoff from on 31 December 2017, killing the pilot and five passengers.

==Locations, access and facilities==
Many of the park&#x27;s attractions are accessible only by walking track. Many kilometres of the park front the shores of Broken Bay, Pittwater and Cowan Creek, making it a good place to explore by boat. Railway stations are at Mount Colah, Mount Kuring-gai, Berowra and Cowan. All roads in the area are sealed and all have collection gates where a daily fee is payable.

*Bobbin Head is located on Cowan Creek and facilities include a marina, picnic areas, a small store, and a lunch-time restaurant in what used to be the Bobbin Head Inn, which also contains an information centre. The area contains many fire trails and a walk through mangroves. Aboriginal engravings can be seen in the area.
*Appletree Bay is a picnic area with a boat ramp and jetty, toilets, picnic tables and barbecues.
*The Basin is a lagoon with a beach on the west side of Pittwater. It has picnic areas and is the only location in the national park where camping is permitted. Access is either by West Head Road via The Basin Track or on a ferry from Palm Beach Wharf.
* West Head is a headland at the north eastern tip of the National Park. A lookout, with views of Barrenjoey, Palm Beach and Broken Bay, has been built on West Head. The Flint &amp; Steel Guesthouse was one of the first buildings on West Head. Gun emplacements were built for WW2 defences, and a bushtrack still leads down to their remnants. 
*Barrenjoey headland is at the northern end of Palm Beach and is not joined to the rest of the Park by land but separated by 1 kilometre of water, the Pittwater. It is the site the historic Barrenjoey Head Lighthouse, constructed in 1880.
*The Sphinx Memorial is a sandstone monument commemorating the fallen Australian Imperial Force comrades of William Shirley during World War I and was created by the returned soldier in the 1920s. The Sphinx took about one and a half years to complete.
*Cottage Point is Sydney&#x27;s smallest locality and is listed as a heritage conservation area. Cottage Point Kiosk and Boat Hire, built around 1918, is situated at Cottage Point at the entrance to Coal and Candle Creek.
* Jerusalem Bay is accessible by a track which is part of the Great North Walk from Cowan railway station next to the Pacific Highway. The track passes through a creek gorge lined with temperate rainforest and large turpentines before opening to the bay. At the bay is an old abandoned habitation site. It opens out to Cowan Water and Broken Bay making it popular with boating and fishing enthusiasts. After the bay the track proceeds up a steep climb past Campbell&#x27;s Crater and along the ridge to Brooklyn. Campbell&#x27;s Crater is a volcanic diatreme containing subtropical rainforest species such as Red Cedars and Cabbage Palms with a floor of ferns.

<text>The Lane Cove National Park is a protected national park that is located within metropolitan Sydney, in New South Wales, Australia. The national park is situated about north-west of the Sydney central business district and features various vegetation types, such as, wet and dry sclerophyll forest, heathland, mangroves and tidal flats. The park consists of land near the banks of the Lane Cove River, which flows generally south-east into Sydney Harbour. It also extends to the outskirts of Pennant Hills and Wahroonga at its northern boundaries.

==Features and location==
The park includes areas of land which are part of Ku-ring-gai, Ryde, and Hornsby local government areas with small areas of the park in Willoughby, Lane Cove and Hunter&#x27;s Hill local government areas on the banks of the lower reaches of the river. The park is surrounded on all sides by developed suburban areas and except for the upper northwestern region is never more than a kilometre wide. Much of the park is of fairly rugged terrain on the slopes of the river valley and covered by dense bush. The characteristics of the bush vary depending upon soils and topography. Parts of the park are affected by weed infestations, such as Fiddens Wharf and Fairyland.

The central section of the park, between De Burghs Bridge on Ryde Road and Fullers Bridge, was set aside as a park in the 1920s and developed with picnic areas interspersed in the bush along the banks of the river. The majority of these picnic areas are located between the Fuller&#x27;s Road bridge and the road that leads towards the Tourist Park. North of this point the area becomes more rugged and there are no picnic areas until the Tunks Hill (previously known as Tunks Farm) area which is away from the river behind the garden nursery on Lane Cove Road.

A weir was constructed in the 1930s near Fullers Bridge which converted the middle section of the river from tidal salt-water to a fresh-water area with constant water level suitable for recreational use in rowing boats and canoes. This area was managed by a trust and was called Lane Cove River Park. In 1982, the Government of New South Wales took over direct control of the park which was then called Lane Cove Regional Park. Various nearby areas of undeveloped government land near the river upstream and downstream from the central area including an area around Pennant Hills Park has also been added to the national park. It was then renamed Lane Cove National Park in 1992. See history for further information.

A fish ladder has been constructed next to the weir to enable Australian bass to access the freshwater breeding grounds upstream of the weir. Fishing is allowed in parts of the Lane Cove River as per restrictions managed by Department of Primary Industries.

The Lane Cove National Park is popular with walkers, joggers and cyclists. The Lane Cove River Tourist Park, operated by the NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service, is located within Lane Cove National Park.

Friends Of Lane Cove National ParkV was formed after the 1994 bushfires and runs volunteer bushcare groups through the park areas. The group also sources grants for bushland regeneration works. 

The main walking track along the Lane Cove River forms part of the Great North Walk from Sydney CBD to Newcastle. This track incorporates a number of old tracks that were, in many cases, old logging trails.

== Flora ==
Common native plant species throughout the park include grass-trees, smooth-barked apples, old man banksias, flannel flowers, scribbly gums, and Wonga Wonga vines. See Friends of Lane Cove National Park list of what&#x27;s flowering in the park.

== Fauna ==
The park is home to a variety of native bird species, including brushturkeys, kookaburras, superb fairywrens, crimson rosellas, sulphur-crested cockatoos, rainbow lorikeets, and eastern whipbirds. Non-native birds such as common mynas and red-whiskered bulbuls also occupy the park. Common reptiles include the Eastern Water Dragon and lace monitors, whilst common mammals include swamp wallabies and echidnas. See Friends of Lane Cove National Park list of fauna observed in the park.

== Urban issues affecting the Park ==
The park&#x27;s position in the middle of a major metropolis necessitates compromises between the social desire for maintaining a pristine environment, and the need for urban development. Two examples of this compromise are: 
# The M2 Hills Motorway crosses the National Park at Epping and is clearly visible for kilometres to bushwalkers traveling along Terry&#x27;s Creek. 
# In 2014 Sydney Water began rebuilding a 3.3 kilometre section of wastewater pipe located beside Terrys Creek, and running through bushland between Forrester Park, Eastwood and Browns Waterhole in the Lane Cove National Park, South Turramurra. This involved upgrading access tracks to the pipeline.

<doc id="101057" wikidata="Q1030926" url="?curid=101057" title="Macquarie Pass National Park">
<text>Macquarie Pass National Park is a national park in New South Wales, Australia, 90 km southwest of Sydney. It is located around the pass of the same name, which is on the Illawarra Highway and part of the Illawarra escarpment.

Macquarie Pass National Park was established in 1970 and protects a range of eucalypt forests and rainforest, including one of Australia&#x27;s most southerly stands of subtropical rainforest. The pass was opened in 1898 and has been a major route into and out of the Illawarra coastal plain ever since. There is a major power line running east–west through the park.

As well as a diverse array of birdlife, the park has swamp wallabies and wombats.

==History==
The area was heavily logged for cedar in the first half of the 19th century.

==Facilities==
Picnic facilities are provided at two sites at the bottom of Macquarie Pass. Barbecues are provided at two other picnic areas.

===Walking tracks===

The Macquarie Rivulet track is two kilometres long and easy to medium grade. A track goes along 30 metres to a parking area near a picnic area and rivulet. An old track continues on along the north side of the rivulet which is flat for several hundred metres, then becomes steeper, dropping back to the rivulet by a large boulder. Birds which may be seen here include dollarbird, azure kingfisher, sacred kingfisher, golden whistler, yellow-throated scrubwren, black-faced monarch and rufous fantail.

The Cascade Falls Walk is a one kilometre track, easy grade. It goes beside Cascade Creek at the base of Macquarie Pass to a small waterfall. Birds found here include green catbird, rose robin, red-browed finch, yellow-throated scrubwren, brown gerygone, Lewin&#x27;s honeyeater, crimson rosella. Fungi are apparent here.

Clover Hill Road is a 3.5 kilometre track, easy grade. It follows a maintenance trail to Macquarie Rivulet and several waterfalls and a large boulder. The track goes to a parking area after 3  kilometres. The track then deteriorates near a Turpentine grove. It then comes to a dilapidated concrete causeway over the rivulet. Crossing it, it goes to Rainbow Falls and a balancing rock. The rock is about 50 metres tall and the waterfall is behind it. Birds here include white-throated treecreeper, large-billed gerygone, Bassian thrush, topknot pigeon, brown cuckoo-dove, wonga pigeon, Australian king parrot, grey goshawk, Lewin&#x27;s honeyeater, and nocturnal spotlighting may produce a powerful or sooty owl.

The Glenview walk is a two kilometre track, easy grade. It goes through tall forest past power lines and eastwards, ceasing at the park boundary. Birds here include variegated fairy-wren, brush cuckoo, fan-tailed cuckoo, crested shrike-tit, golden bronze-cuckoo.

The Upper Cascade Creek Walk is a two kilometre track of moderate grade.

The Brown Barrel Walk is an easy to moderate grade track half a kilometre in length that goes from Nurrewin past power lines and through rainforest and moist eucalypt forest. Birds here include superb lyrebird, pilotbird, cicadabird, logrunner, rose robin, golden whistler, king parrot, topknot pigeon. Its name derives from &quot;Eucalyptus fastigata&quot;, or brown barrel.

The Mount Murray Road Track is a one and a half kilometre track of easy grade. It follows the powerline easement in a loop track. Birds include red-browed treecreeper, satin flycatcher, black-faced monarch and rufous fantails in late spring to autumn months.

==Locality==
The locality of Macquarie Pass is defined as a suburb of the City of Shellharbour, &quot;containing, more or less, the Macquarie Pass National Park, about 11 km west of Albion Park&quot;. At the , it had no population.

The Mallee Cliffs National Park is managed to protect the sand plain and sand dune land systems and ecological communities known colloquially as &quot;Mallee Country&quot;. Emphasis is placed on its value as a wildlife conservation area and it was established primarily to protect the habitat of the malleefowl.

==History==
The park was established in 1977, when the entire property was purchased by the Foundation for National Parks &amp; Wildlife.

==Access==
The park is closed to the public as part of an ongoing policy to protect malleefowl and other threatened animals, and to assist in meeting other conservation objectives. Access is limited to educational activities by schools and colleges, and research activities which are relevant to the management of the park and compatible with conservation policies.

==Environment==

===Geography===
The Mallee Cliffs National Park preserves the original clay red plains of south west New South Wales, protecting extensive areas of flat to undulating sandy red plains and linear sand dunes formed during arid periods from 350,000 to 500,000 years ago.

===Flora===
The park preserves undisturbed tracts of mallee vegetation, and rosewood-belah woodland. Mallee are small eucalyptus trees and shrubs with many small stems and thick underground roots that retain water. Before irrigation farming began, dense thickets of mallee characterized most of northwestern Victoria, and areas of south-western New South Wales. The park contains an important representation of mallee communities, including both bull mallee and whipstick mallee. These flora types are continuing to be extensively cleared on private property for grazing both immediately outside the park and throughout the country. The park contains a number of isolated, relict plant communities that demonstrate shifts in the pattern of vegetation arising from long-term environmental change.

In January 1975 a bushfire ravaged the region which later became national park, making the average age of the vegetation considerably younger than similar protected areas. This makes the park a less attractive option for release of certain animals such as the black-eared miner, which use older trees and mallee bushes as habitat.

===Fauna===
The park lies within the Southern NSW Mallee Important Bird Area, identified by BirdLife International as supporting a significant population of the vulnerable malleefowl. The park is the only reserve in New South Wales with malleefowl habitat. The malleefowl is found in arid areas only where the mallee grows. The males build a nest for the eggs by digging a large pit in winter and filling it with leaves and grass over the next four months. The female lays one egg per day for several days in the spring. The male then covers the resulting mound with sand. As the compost heap rots it generates heat. The male keeps watch over the mound, and tests the temperature of the mound with his tongue, adding or removing sand. When the chick hatches, it digs its way out, and once they emerge at the top of the mound are renowned for standing stationary at the top for up to twenty minutes before racing/staggering off into the bush. The chicks hatch with feathers and are immediately independent, never needing any parental care. Malleefowl grow to a length of around .

Several species of small birds are found in the area, as well as emus. Mammals include a significant population of western grey kangaroos as well as pygmy possums and the little pied bat and greater long-eared bat which use older trees as nesting hollows. The mallee spinifex of the park is the main habitat for the western blue-tongue and southern spinifex slender blue-tongue lizards.

In 2020, the endangered numbat was re-introduced to the Mallee Cliffs. Future releases will help bring the population to an expected maximum of 270 numbats within the national park.

<text>Marramarra National Park is a protected national park that is located in the Hawkesbury region of northwestern Sydney, New South Wales, in eastern Australia. The national park is situated approximately northwest of the Sydney central business district.

==Description==

The park is bounded by the Hawkesbury River in the north; Berowra Creek in the east; and private land to the south and west. The national park may be accessed from via the Old Northern Road or from via the Galston Road through the Galston Gorge.

The park is administered by Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. It offers bushwalkers a wide range of environments, from the mangrove communities along Marramarra Creek to the drier, sclerophyll scrub along the ridges. Access is provided predominantly by fire trails and service roads, frequently alongside power lines, with no dedicated walking tracks.

Marramarra was a traditional area for the Aboriginal people of Darug. There are still places that testify to their traditional life here. Rock engravings, cave art, grinding grooves, scarred trees and other stone arrangements are part of this national park.

<text>Meroo National Park is a national park in on South Coast of New South Wales, Australia.

==History==
Meroo has only recently been designated as a National Park. Previously it was a state forest which contained an unregulated camp ground with beautiful beaches and bushland. The area was badly damaged over ten years ago by bushfires. Because of this damage and its constant use by holiday goers the National Park lands authority decided to create a National Park on this State Forest land in an attempt to help regenerate the bushland.

==Description==
As well as the beaches there are tidal rockpools and a rocky island that can be reached at low tide. Many sea creatures can be found such as crabs, star fish, small fish and sea urchins. Since its creation as a National Park new rules and regulations have been brought in to increase care of the natural bushland and native fauna. Fenced off areas around the headlands to stop erosion have been created and areas for camping have been reduced. This has helped to increase the natural bush regenerate from the devastating fires. The park&#x27;s wildlife appears to be increasing in numbers with wallabies and possums being seen regularly. The sound of native birds can be heard again too. The park forms part of the Ulladulla to Merimbula Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for swift parrots.

Meroo is home to 12 endangered wildlife species, including the nationally endangered green and golden bell frog. 

The average elevation of the terrain is 55 metres above sea level.

<text>The Morton National Park is a national park located in the Southern Highlands, South Coast and Illawarra regions of New South Wales, Australia, situated approximately south southwest of Sydney.

==Location and features==
The most notable attractions are the Fitzroy Falls that are located adjacent to the main road linking the Southern Highlands with the upper South Coast and lower Illawarra regions, via Kangaroo Valley; and the Pigeon House Mountain that is located west of Milton. The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Servicemanaged park consists mostly of a flat plateau dissected by steep gorges, tilting gently to the northeast. The boundaries of the park extend from Bundanoon south to the west of Ulladulla and the park contains part of the Budawang Range. To the south of the park is the adjacent Budawang National Park. In the north section of the park, the Fitzroy Falls and the Belmore Falls plunge off the plateaux into rainforest gullies. The Shoalhaven River flows in the north and northwest sections of the park. In the east is Mount Tianjara, with an elevation of above sea level.

== History ==
The Morton National Park was opened in 1938 and was named after Mark Morton, a state legislative assembly member, who passionately advocated for its establishment. It is estimated to have been inhabited by the aboriginal people almost 20,000 years ago. The Yuin people attach great significance to the park and its surrounding areas along with the Didthul mountain, which is a part of the aboriginal mythology.

<text>Mount Imlay is a national park in New South Wales (Australia), 387 km south of Sydney, named after the Imlay brothers, who were early pioneers to the district. It is accessed from the Princes Highway, south of Eden, New South Wales. The mountain is called &quot;Balawan&quot; by Bidwell and Yuin peoples, and it is very important for their culture and spiritual teachings.

The vegetation is mostly eucalyptus forest. The Imlay Mallee and Imlay Boronia are rare plants growing near the mountain&#x27;s summit. However, there is a rainforest remnant surviving in a fire-free gully. It consists mostly of Black Olive Berry trees. The park contains large populations of wombats and superb lyrebirds.

== Geology==

Most of Mt Imlay National Park was formed during the Ordovician Period, 500 to 435 million years ago, from sedimentary and metamorphosed rocks of the Mallacoota Beds, part of the Southern Highlands Fold Belt, including greywacke, sandstone and shale. The summit of Mt Imlay and the upper slopes are younger, with Devonian (395 to 345 Million years ago) rocks of the Merimbula Group, lying above the Ordovician sediments. The Merimbula Group includes sandstone, conglomerates, quartzite, siltstone and shale. Quaternary sediments form narrow river flats along the Towamba River on the northern edge of the park.

The park forms the outer rim of Tweed Caldera, a volcano that was active 21 million years ago. Its establishment followed campaigns against logging in the area, including a blockade in the Nullum State Forest in 1995.

==Important Bird Area==
The park lies within the Nightcap Range Important Bird Area, so identified by BirdLife International because it contains the largest known population of Albert&#x27;s lyrebirds, as well as several other significant bird species.

<doc id="101072" wikidata="Q1950327" url="?curid=101072" title="Mount Kaputar National Park">
<text>The Mount Kaputar National Park is a national park located in New South Wales, Australia, surrounding the proximities of Mount Kaputar, a volcano active between 17 and 21 million years ago. It is located east of Narrabri and northwest of Sydney. Millions of years of erosion have since carved the volcanic region into the lava terraces, volcanic plugs, and dykes of Nandewar Range. The central feature of the region is Mount Kaputar, the park&#x27;s namesake, which rises to an altitude of . The 360 degree view from the summit of the mountain encompasses one-tenth of New South Wales&#x27; area or .

The park protects a wide range of biomes, including semi-arid woodland, subalpine heath, and eucalypt forests, and provides a habitat for a range of animals, including bats, birds, wallabies, quolls, and the unique red triangle slug (&quot;Triboniophorus graeffei&quot;) and pink slug (&quot;Triboniophorus sp. nov. &#x27;Kaputar&#x27;&quot;), which are known to appear after rainfall.

==History==
Before it was a national park, the area was used largely as grazing land for domestic animals. The conditions in the park are very harsh, but several pioneering families lived there, and remnants of their occupation remain. Sheep and cattle continued to graze on the plateau until around the 1950s. It was an isolated place, and the stockmen in charge of the cattle often would not see another human for months at a time.

In 1925, some of land around Mount Kaputar were declared a &quot;Reserve for Public Recreation&quot;. Two years later, a trust, known as the Mount Kaputar Trust, was formed to give guidance on managing the park. The area was expanded to and proclaimed a full national park in 1959. Eight years later, in 1967, the Fund relinquished the duties of controlling the park to the newly established National Parks and Wildlife Service, and the park is still administered by a regional advisory board.

==Facilities and activities==
In 1965, two cabins were constructed at Dawsons Spring, providing accommodations including a permanent water supply for showers and toilets, and a picnic facility. Today there are 3 cabins, including the one facilitated from Bark Hut.

The park is popular with rockclimbers, and there are 11 walks in the park, as well as a camping ground. However, the most popular site in the park is Scutts Hut, located upward of Kurrawonga Falls. The hut is the former home of the Scutt family, a pioneer family living in the vicinity of the park. it is accessible via a fire trail from the Bark Hut camping grounds. The hut has been restored to its original livery, with an earthen floor and an open fireplace. The hut is built on the banks of Horsearm Creek, which flows into Kurrawonga Falls.

<text>Wollumbin National Park (previously known as &#x27;Mount Warning National Park&#x27;) is a national park located in northern New South Wales, Australia, north of Sydney near the border with the state of Queensland. It surrounds Mount Warning, part of a remnant caldera of a much larger extinct volcano (the Tweed volcano). The park is administered by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service. The park is part of the Scenic Rim Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance in the conservation of several species of threatened birds. In addition to numerous bird species, carpet python, land mullet, eastern small-eyed snake, lace monitor, black-bellied marsh snake and long-nosed potoroo can be found here.

Wollumbin rises to 1157 metres above sea level.

==History==

The park incorporates lands of traditional significance to the local Bundjalung people. The local Aboriginal name for the mountain is &quot;Wollumbin&quot;; meaning, &quot;cloud-catcher&quot;, or alternatively &quot;fighting chief of the mountains&quot;. The mountain&#x27;s English name was bestowed on it by Lieutenant James Cook in May 1770, as his expedition in command of the &quot;Endeavour&quot; passed it by on their route northwards along the eastern coastline of Australia. The designation &quot;Mount Warning&quot; was meant to indicate the danger of the offshore reefs they encountered. The park was reserved for public recreation in 1928 and dedicated as a national park in 1966. The Park is part of the Shield Volcano Group of the World Heritage Site Gondwana Rainforests of Australia inscribed in 1986 and added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2007.

<doc id="101077" wikidata="Q581883" url="?curid=101077" title="Mummel Gulf National Park">
<text>Mummel Gulf is a national park located in New South Wales, Australia, approximately by road north of Sydney. It is situated approximately southeast of Walcha on the unsealed Enfield Forest Road and south of the Oxley Highway.

The Mummel River has formed the deep V-shaped gorge of the Mummel Gulf, which exceeds in the head of this gorge.

==Flora and fauna==
The Mummel Gulf National Park protects tall, open eucalypt forest on the south-eastern escarpment of the New England region. The park communities also include wet sclerophyll forest and snow gum (&quot;Eucalyptus pauciflora&quot;) forest in the higher parts of the park, around Porters Camp. Messmate (&quot;Eucalyptus obliqua&quot;) and less commonly Mountain Ribbon Gum (&quot;Eucalyptus nobilis&quot;) dominate old-growth forests in this area which drops from 1,450 metres down to 470 m. Other trees in the region include silvertop stringybark (&quot;Eucalyptus laevopinea&quot;), blue gum (&quot;Eucalyptus saligna&quot;), diehard stringybark (&quot;Eucalyptus cameronii&quot;) and New England blackbutt (&quot;Eucalyptus andrewsii&quot;). Broad-leaved pepperbush (&quot;Tasmannia purpurascens&quot;) is at its northern limit in the area. Many species of shrubs flower here during spring and summer.

Bushwalkers accessing the remote central and southern sections of the park&#x27;s moist subtropical rainforest will find a mix of corkwood, sassafras (&quot;Doryphora sassafras&quot;), large tree ferns (&quot;Dicksonia&quot;) and silver sycamore (&quot;Cryptocarya glaucescens&quot;).

The park also protects threatened species such as the koala, tiger quoll, sugar glider, yellow-bellied glider, superb lyrebird, boobook owl, sooty owl, powerful owl, tawny frogmouth and parma wallaby.

==History==

This region and its escarpment served as the boundary between the Nganyaywana people of the Northern Tablelands and the Danggati who had the hinterland valleys leading up to the tableland.

The explorer John Oxley passed by the Apsley Falls in September 1818 and travelled eastwards through this area en route to Port Macquarie. Timber-getters and illegal settlers soon followed. The Wool Road (now the Oxley Highway), was built through here in 1842 with convict labour to link the wool-growing settlement of Walcha with Port Macquarie. Some of the park has been logged, although only small sections of the park have been cleared. Some areas have also been used for cattle grazing and for small-scale manganese mining.

In the 1970s Enfield and Riamukka State Forests were expanded over former Crown lands to include the steep areas of the Mummel River catchment.

The Bicentennial National Trail which was first used in the 1970s follows the Mummel Forest Road to the east of the park.

Porters (Camp) air navigation facility and Country Energy towers are situated at in the northern portion of the park.

In 1992 North-East Forest Alliance Forest (NEFA) protesters set up a camp in what is now Mummel Gulf National Park. NEFA protested against logging here and won an agreement to delay logging to allow a joint study by NEFA and the New South Wales Forestry Commission. Mummel Gulf National Park was created in 1999, as part of the national regional forest agreement process.

==Pest animals and weeds==
Some wild pigs and wild dogs live in the park. The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) staff conduct pig trapping and shooting programs. A ground-baiting program is run in conjunction with Forests NSW and private landholders to help control wild dogs.

Crofton weed (&quot;Ageratina adenophora&quot;) and blackberry (&quot;Rubus fruticosus&quot;) are the main weeds of concern in the park.

==Access and facilities==
The gravel road is accessible by all vehicles but it would be advisable to have a four-wheel drive (4WD) in wet conditions. The Panhandle Fire Trail is a 9.5 km four-wheel drive trail located within the park.

New Country Swamp has a basic camping area with toilets, picnic tables and barbecues situated 13 km from the highway and inside the National Park. Campsites are suitable for camper trailers or camping beside ones vehicle. Not suitable for caravans.

<doc id="101078" wikidata="Q1670728" url="?curid=101078" title="Mungo National Park">
<text>Mungo National Park is a protected national park that is located in south-western New South Wales, in eastern Australia. The national park is situated approximately west of Sydney in the Balranald Shire. 

Mungo National Park is the traditional meeting place of the Muthi Muthi, Nyiampaar and Barkinji Aboriginal Nations. People are no longer able to climb the sand dunes by themselves as stricter rules have been enforced, all visitors groups need to be accompanied by an accredited tour guide to access the sand dunes.

The national park is part of the UNESCO World Heritagelisted Willandra Lakes Region, an area of that incorporates seventeen dry lakes. The seventeen dry lakes are not all called Mungo but are all declared world heritage. The creek that used to flow into Mungo is being preserved as a sacred site. The national park is about south-east of Pooncarie, north-east of Mildura and approximately , 90 minutes drive south-west of . The roads to, in or around the park are unsealed and can be accessed in 2-wheel-drive cars, but councils will close the road in wet weather.

==History==
The area that in 1979 was declared a National Park is the traditional land of the Barkindji, Ngiyampaa and Mutthi Mutthi. These original inhabitants were driven off by European squatters for their sheep farming in the 1840s, a remnant of which is the 45m woodshed, constructed from Murray pine in 1869 by Chinese labourers. The indigenous who survived the seizure of their homeland, and European-introduced diseases, were moved to a mission at Balranald. Mungo sheep station (15,700 ha.) was subdivided from Gol-Gol holdings after WWI for returned soldiers, the Cameron Brothers, who named it after St Mungo’s Church in Scotland. The station lease included the eastern lake lunette, while a small section at the southern end was covered by Jounli station.

==Features and location==
The central feature of Mungo National Park is Lake Mungo, the second largest of the ancient dry lakes. The Mungo National Park is noted for the archaeological remains discovered in the park the remains of Mungo Man, the oldest human remains discovered in Australia, and Mungo Lady, the oldest known human to have been ritually cremated. They were buried on the shore of Lake Mungo, beneath the &#x27;Walls of China&#x27;, a series of lunettes on the South eastern edge of the lake.

A visitor centre, where further information and a map may be acquired, is located near the old Mungo woolshed and the entrance to the park. A signposted circular vehicle track allows visitors to drive to the spectacular Walls of China and around the lakes. The Shearers&#x27; Quarters can provide bunk accommodation and a communal kitchen for a daily fee. Camping and park access fees may be paid at the visitor centre.

Mungo National Park was acquired for the National Reserve System in 1979 by the Foundation for National Parks and Wildlife. This organisation fundraised the $101,000 required to purchase the property. The Foundation also funded a resident archaeologist to work on the site from 1979 to 1983. With funds donated by Dick Smith, the Foundation established the Mungo Visitors Centre and Laboratory in 1983. With further sponsorship from BHP, the Foundation implemented the Mungo National Park long guided vehicle drive in 1990. , the Foundation put together a prospectus to create a new Centre at Mungo for education and research. Glenn Murcutt, an Australian architect and winner of the 2002 Pritzker Prize and 2009 AIA Gold Medal, along with Wendy Lewin, were scheduled to design the building.

== Accommodation ==
The National Park campground provides accommodation for visiting residents.

An Eco lodge provides cabin accommodation, caravan sites and glamping. There is also a restaurant and bar onsite, tours can be booked at the lodge.

<text>The Mutawintji National Park, formerly the Mootwingee National Park, is a protected national park that is located in the Far West region of New South Wales, in eastern Australia. The national park is situated approximately west of Sydney and about north-east of .

==Features and location==

The rugged, mulga-clad Byngnano Range is dissected by colourful gorges, rockpools and creek beds lined with red gums. Scattered among the caves and overhangs are Aboriginal rock art and engravings.

In 1979, the Foundation for National Parks &amp; Wildlife purchased and fenced , in the Coturaundee Ranges, now part of Mutawintji National Park, for the conservation and protection of the yellow-footed rock wallaby.

Follow-up funding of fox eradication in the reserve ensured the survival of this last population of yellow-footed rock-wallabies in New South Wales. Of the wild animals, wedge-tailed eagle, peregrine falcon, short-billed correllas, zebra finches, budgerigars, apostle birds and magpies can also be found here.

The park also protects Mutawintji Historic Site, containing one of the best collections of Australian Aboriginal rock art.

<text>Myall Lakes National Park is a national park located in New South Wales, Australia, north of Sydney. It encompasses one of the state&#x27;s largest coastal lake systems Myall Lakes, and includes Broughton Island. The park includes 40 kilometres of beaches and rolling sand dunes. Myall Lakes is also one of the most visited parks in New South Wales.

==History==
The Worimi Aboriginal people had inhabited the Myall Lakes National Park land area for its abundance of natural resources. These natural resources had offered a traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle for the Worimi people. The park includes important spiritual sites that are an important part of the identity of local Aboriginal people. Dark Point Aboriginal Place served as a location for the Worimi people to gather together for ceremonies and feasts and has been of significance to Worimi people for at least 4000 years.

==Environment==
Myall Lakes National Park incorporates a patchwork of freshwater lakes, the ocean, islands, native flora, dense littoral rainforest and beaches.

Since 1999, Myall Lakes has been listed under the Ramsar Convention.

===Fauna===
The lakes support a large variety of birds including bowerbirds, white-bellied sea eagle and tawny frogmouths.

Other native Fauna which can be seen in the park includes the nocturnal long-nosed bandicoot which has grey-brown fur and a pointed snout for which it uses to forage for worms and insects. The Striped marsh frog can be found near ponds and swamps and has a distinct sound which can be heard all year round. The Eastern swamp crayfish was first discovered here.

==Climate==
The average high temperature during the summer season averages between 19 °C and 27 °C. The highest temperature recorded at the park is 41.5 °C. The average temperature during the winter season averages between 10 °C and 19 °C with the lowest temperature on record being 1.1 °C. The wettest month typically occurs in May while the driest month occurs in November. The area&#x27;s highest recorded rainfall in one day is 257.8mm.

<text>Nangar is a national park in located New South Wales, Australia, west of Sydney. The park is located in the Nangar-Murga Range between Eugowra and Canowindra. It features Nangar Mountain, which rises to .

Trees consist of eucalyptus, blackpine, scribbly gum and ironbark. Shrubs include spider flowers, thyme spurge, nodding blue lily and waxlip orchids.

Birds recorded include wrens, thornbills, falcons, hawks, peregrine falcons and glossy black cockatoos. Eastern grey kangaroos and grey, redneck and swamp wallabies are common.

The park was originally established in 1983 when 1,550 hectares of bushland were declared a national park. &quot;Dripping Rock&quot; was added to the park in 1988 and, in 1994, the Nangar State Forest was added to the park to expand its size to 9,196 hectares. &quot;Dripping Rock&quot; was a grazing property established in 1928 and named after a local seasonal waterfall. The original &quot;Dripping Rock&quot; homestead was converted to a shearing shed and a new homestead, built in 1935, was destroyed by a bushfire in September 2009.

<doc id="101083" wikidata="Q1571056" url="?curid=101083" title="Nattai National Park">
<text>The Nattai National Park is a protected area located in the Macarthur and Southern Highlands regions of New South Wales, Australia. The area is situated approximately southwest of the Sydney central business district and primarily encompasses the valley of the Nattai River, which is surrounded by sandstone cliffs. Part of the Southern Highlands Shale Forest and Woodland, the park is covered in dry sclerophyll (hard-leafed) forest – mostly eucalypt, and has frequent forest fires. As of May 2024, the park has no facilities.

The Nattai National Park is one of the eight protected areas that, in 2000, was inscribed to form part of the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Greater Blue Mountains Area. The Nattai National Park is the most southern of the eight protected areas within the World Heritage Site. The national park forms part of the Great Dividing Range.

The national park is bounded to the north by the Nattai State Conservation Area, the Burragorang State Conservation Area, and Lake Burragorang, inclusive of a exclusion zone surrounding the lake; to the east by the Bargo State Conservation Area and the now partly disused Picton – Mittagong loop railway line; to the south by the Wombeyan Caves Road; to the southwest by the Kanangra-Boyd National Park; and to the west by the Yerranderie State Conservation Area. Blue Mountains National Park does not directly adjoin the Nattai National Park, but is located on the northwestern shore of Lake Burragorang.

The Nattai National Park contains much of the course and catchment of the Little, Nattai, Allum and Wollondilly rivers.

==History==
The area now known as Nattai National Park has had a limited impact from Europeans. Several early expeditions attempting to cross the Blue Mountains passed through the area at the end of the 18th century, and settlers settled in the lower Nattai and Burragorang Valleys in 1827. Early conservationists Myles Dunphy and Herb Gallop went on bushwalks in the region from 1912 onward. An area of note was a forest of &quot;Eucalyptus saligna,&quot; commonly referred to as Sydney blue gum around Blue Gum Creek which was held in high regard.

Dunphy lobbied for the stand to be preserved upon becoming aware of plans to log the area but was unsuccessful, and the area was logged in the 1920s and 30s. Dunphy put forward a plan for a Greater Blue Mountains National Park, which incorporated what is now Nattai National Park in the southeast in 1932. The creation of Warragamba Dam in 1960 limited access for the development of land upstream, but it was not until 1991 that plans for permanent protection and national park status looked to become realized.

==Access==
The national park can be accessed via Wattle Ridge Fire Road, located northeast of the small town of Hill Top. Access to a small, unsealed car park situated at the edge of the park is through an unsealed road. There are no facilities available except for an information board and a logbook. Visitors are required to sign in and out of the logbook when entering and exiting the park.

Alternate access is via the Wombeyan Caves Road.

==Activities==
===Bushwalking===
Nattai National Park has several bushwalk trails. Backpack camping is allowed, with a remote campground by the Nattai River known as Emitts Flat at the end of the Starlights Trail.

The difficulties on the park&#x27;s trails include: limited mobile reception, all trails requiring bushwalking experience and encounters with wildlife, such as snakes or wombats, being common.

=== Trails ===
; The Starlights Trail: Starlights Trail is a scenic bushwalk in Nattai National Park, part of the Greater Blue Mountains trail network between Mittagong and Katoomba in Country NSW. Designed for experienced hikers, the trail spans 11 kilometers round trip and typically takes 4 to 5 hours to complete. It is classified as a Grade 4 hike, indicating a challenging route through varied landscapes in the Sydney surrounds.
; Russells Needle: An extension of Starlights Trail from Emmetts Flat south along the Nattai River to a tall rock spire.
; Katoomba to Mittagong Trail: A long-distance trail starting in the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area – in length.
; Couridjah Corridor walk: Couridjah Corridor Walk is a 14-kilometer return trail that traverses both Thirlmere Lakes National Park and Nattai National Park in Sydney and surrounds, Country NSW. This trail is ideal for hiking, bushwalking, and birdwatching. The walk typically takes between 4 and 6 hours to complete and is classified as a Grade 4 hike, indicating a challenging route suited for experienced hikers.

<text>The New England National Park is a protected national park located on the Northern Tablelands in the New England region of New South Wales, Australia. The park was created in May 1935 and is situated approximately north of Sydney, and south of Waterfall Way, just east of Armidale and west of Coffs Harbour. The closest village to New England National Park is Ebor, located away.

The park is part of the New England Group World Heritage Site Gondwana Rainforests of Australia inscribed in 1986 and added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2007.

More than 1,000 plant species are found within the park, attracting prolific birdlife.

==History==
In the 1920s Phillip Wright of Wollomombi led the push to have this area declared a National Park. Most of the area was declared a reserve in 1931 and in 1935 dedicated for public recreation. Between 1934 and 1956 mining leases for antimony were granted.

The national park was officially opened by the Governor General Lord Gowrie in 1937, although the wilderness area was recognised for its beauty as early as the 1920s.

New England National Park (NENP) was World Heritage listed in 1986 and forms part of the New England Group of the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia (previously the Central Eastern Rainforest Reserves of Australia) (CERRA). In 1999 the Mount Killekrankie area, which had been subject to anti-logging blockade earlier in the decade, was added to the park. The Gondwana Rainforests of Australia was added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2007.

==Geography==

Located on the precipitous escarpment on the east of the undulating Northern Tablelands plateau, the wilderness consists of impressive cliffs, rugged ridges, spurs and streams. To the west the Nymboida, Guy Fawkes and Styx Rivers drain across the tablelands. To the east is the thickly forested Bellinger River valley.

The Cunnawarra National Park adjoins the New England National Park on the north-western boundary and the Bellinger River National Park joins it on the north-eastern corner.

Public access to the park focuses on the Point Lookout area, at above sea level, from where on a clear day the Tasman Sea is visible. This lookout is the second tallest mountain in the region and one of the highest places north of the Snowy Mountains.

==Flora and fauna==

The park lies within the Eastern Australian temperate forests ecoregion. It is noted for the wide variety of plant and animal species. The diverse vegetation in the park includes sub-tropical, warm temperate and cool temperate rainforest in the higher altitudes. There are also areas of sclerophyll forest, sub-alpine woodland, heathland and swampland. In the eucalpyt forests Brush box, Sydney blue gum and Tallow-wood predominate.

Heathland is found at Wrights Lookout and in other patches. Previous estimates of the number of different plant species in the park place the figure at 500. This figure has been revised upwards to around 1,000. This includes snow gums (&quot;Eucalyptus pauciflora&quot;), Antarctic beech, tree ferns and red cedars (&quot;Toona ciliata&quot;).

Dingos, koalas, tiger quolls, common bentwing bats, brown antechinuses, and northern brown bandicoots are some of the mammals found in the park.

===Birds===
At least 100 species of birds have been recorded. Larger species include the wedge-tailed eagle, greater sooty owl, sulphur-crested cockatoo and superb lyrebird. Eastern whipbirds, eastern bristlebirds, crimson rosellas, Australian king parrots and several kinds of honeyeaters also inhabit the reserve.

The park has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports one of five remaining populations of rufous scrub-birds, as well as of flame and pale-yellow robins, paradise riflebirds, green catbirds, regent bowerbirds and Australian logrunners.

==Facilities==
There is an extensive walking track system that traverses the higher areas of the park.

Limited accommodation is available in the park at Banksia Point. If visiting in winter it is a good idea to bring warm clothes because at such a high altitude the region experiences frequent snow falls and cold temperatures.

<doc id="101086" wikidata="Q1573530" url="?curid=101086" title="Nightcap National Park">
<text>The Nightcap National Park is a national park situated within the Nightcap Range in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Australia. The park was created in April 1983 and is situated north of . The park was established following campaigns and blockades against logging at Terania Creek, Grier&#x27;s Scrub and Mount Nardi between 1979 and 1982. Sections of the Whian Whian state forest were added to it following blockading and campaigning in 1998. The national park is classed by the IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas as Category II and is part of the Shield Volcano Group of the World Heritage Site Gondwana Rainforests of Australia inscribed in 1986 and added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2007.

==Regional geology and climate==
The park is on the south-eastern edge of the Mount Warning erosion caldera. Creating features of gullies, ridges and a massif of peaks that form the eroded remnants of the Tweed shield volcano. The tallest peak at Nightcap is Mount Burrell also known as Blue Knob with an elevation of 933m above sea level. The Nightcap Range is mostly situated in the park and is a spur off the Great Dividing Range.

The basalt and rhyolite lava that once flowed from the Tweed volcano (known as Mount Warning), which erupted over 23 million years ago, has produced various vegetation communities. On soil with a rhyolitic base is warm temperate rainforest that covers much of the park, and the nutrient rich basalt soil produces sub-tropical rainforest.

Nightcap has the highest rainfall in NSW with rain exceeding 2500mm per annum. The mean temperature ranges from 19.1 °C to 29.7 °C; the region can experience high humidity and temperatures can get close to 40 °C. High rainfall events and storms of cyclonic strength can occur during the summer.

== Aboriginal heritage ==
Several Aboriginal communities inhabited the region and had a spiritual connection to the land, including the Wiyabal people, Nganduwal people, and Galibal, Githabul speaking peoples. The Wiyabal people lived at Nightcap Range for at least 4000 years. The region is the base for the Bundjalung nation. Historically the park provides rock shelters for the Aboriginal people. The park&#x27;s landscapes, plants and animals feature prominently in Aboriginal culture and dreaming stories and there are sacred sites of high cultural significance in the area.

== Park history ==
Before it became a national park, it provided the historic link between the Richmond and Tweed valleys known as the Historic Nightcap Track. It provided the first bridle track in 1871 and as of 1874 a telegraph line between the two valleys. A section of this historic link is now part of a walking track at the park.

The beginning of the modern conservation movement involving direct action occurred during 1972 to 1982 in the upper Northern Rivers region. The conservation campaigns started in an attempt to prevent further logging of the rainforest in the region. Terania Creek at Nightcap was the site of the first rainforest anti-logging demonstrations in Australia. By 1979 the campaign against logging increased in intensity, starting an event known as the three-year Rainforest War involving a group of dedicated activists being supported by former NSW Premier Neville Wran. At one point, 100 people took radical action, forming a human barricade to block bulldozers.
&quot;So overpowering was the draw of these trees that people risked their lives. A spirit of transformation emanated from the forest.&quot; - Ian Cohen, Green MLC, 1997
Nightcap became a national park in 1983 under the Forestry Revocation and National Park Reservation Act 1983 (NSW) involving an area of the former Goonimbar State Forest (SF). The remainder of Goonimbar SF and part of Whian Whian SF were added to the national park later that year. By 1989 UNESCO created world heritage protection for 41 reserves in south-eastern Queensland and north-eastern NSW including the western half of Nightcap. The world heritage area is known as the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia that protects several remnants of subtropical rainforest with high biodiversity and unique geological landforms, with evolutionary links to Gondwana.

In 2009 BirdLife International identified the Nightcap Range as important bird and biodiversity areas (IBA). The Nightcap Range IBA includes Nightcap NP, Mount Jerusalem NP, Goonengerry NP and Whian Whian State Conservation Area (SCA). It has been recognised for its populations of Albert&#x27;s lyrebird &quot;(Menura alberti)&quot;, green catbird &quot;(Ailuroedus crassirostris)&quot;, pale-yellow robin &quot;(Tregellasia capito)&quot;, Australian logrunner &quot;(Orthonyx temminckii)&quot;, paradise riflebird &quot;(Ptiloris paradiseus)&quot; and regent bowerbird &quot;(Sericulus chrysocephalus)&quot;.

==Ecology==

Approximately 70% of Nightcap NP is covered by a variety of rainforest communities, and the rest is covered by mostly wet sclerophyll forest and partly dry sclerophyll forest. The park also supports lowland species of the former Big Scrub, which was the largest area of subtropical lowland rainforest that was intensively cleared; now less than 1% remains. Of all the known native vascular flora in NSW about 10% of it can be found here with 72 that are identified as threatened with extinction. The park supports a rich diversity of species that includes more than 40 species of mammals, 27 reptiles, 23 frogs, over 140 bird species, over 650 known plant species including numerous ferns and various orchids, and a diverse variety of fungus and lichens.

As of 2011, Forests of East Australia became the 35th Biodiversity Hotspot, which includes Nightcap NP. The concept of the Biodiversity Hotspot is that there are &quot;exceptional concentrations of endemic species that are undergoing exceptional loss of habitat&quot;.

== Threatened flora and fauna ==

=== Mammals ===
Spotted-tailed quoll &quot;(Dasyurus maculatus)&quot; is an endangered species listed on the EPBC Act. It is a medium-sized marsupial carnivore, the largest of the &quot;Dasyurus&quot; species, distinguished by the white spots on the tail. The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is listed as vulnerable under the EPBC Act. The Parma wallaby &quot;(Macropus parma)&quot; is listed as vulnerable in NSW under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 (TSC Act), is a small nocturnal, cryptic wallaby that was once thought to be extinct. Another species listed as vulnerable under the TSC Act is the yellow-bellied glider &quot;(Petaurus australis)&quot; often found in old-growth wet sclerophyll forests. The rufous bettong &quot;(Aepyprymnus rufescens)&quot; is a roughly 3 kg marsupial that has significantly declined in range since European settlement. Long-nosed potoroo &quot;(Potorous tridactylus)&quot; and red-legged pademelon &quot;(Thylogale stigmatica)&quot; are also listed.

=== Bats ===

Many microbat and megabat species inhabit the park, several of which are threatened. The following bats are listed as vulnerable on the TSC Act: greater broad-nosed bat &quot;(Scoteanax rueppellii)&quot;, eastern long-eared bat &quot;(Nyctophilus bifax)&quot;, golden-tipped bat &quot;(Kerivoula papuensis)&quot;, eastern false pipistrelle &quot;(Falsistrellus tasmaniensis)&quot;, large-eared pied bat &quot;(Chalinolobus dwyeri)&quot;, yellow-bellied sheathtail-bat &quot;(Saccolaimus flaviventris)&quot;, eastern tube-nosed bat &quot;(Nyctimene robinsoni)&quot;, little bentwing-bat &quot;(Miniopterus australis)&quot;, Eastern bentwing-bat &quot;(Miniopterus schreibersii oceanensis)&quot; and southern myotis &quot;(Myotis macropus).&quot;
=== Birds ===

The red goshawk &quot;(Erythrotriorchis radiatus)&quot; is listed as critically endangered under the TSC Act and is vulnerable under the EPBC Act. It is a large raptor with a wingspan of up to 60 cm that often preys upon smaller birds. It can be found nesting in tall trees along riparian vegetation. The black-breasted button-quail (&quot;Turnix melanogaster)&quot; is also listed as critically endangered, due to 90% of its habitat being cleared since European settlement and the remainder of its rainforest habitat being highly fragmented. The rufous scrub-bird &quot;(Atrichornis rufescens)&quot; is a threatened bird on the TSC Act. This medium size (about 17 cm body size) ground-dwelling bird that relies on dense ground vegetation for nesting. Another threatened species is the white-eared monarch &quot;(Carterornis leucotis)&quot;, a small bird which relies on insects for the majority of its diet and nests high in the canopy near the rainforest edges. The marbled frogmouth &quot;(Podargus ocellatus)&quot;, related to the nightjars family, is a threatened bird listed on the TSC Act. It prefers rainforest creeks with Bangalow palms or ferns. Several fruit-doves are listed as threatened on the TSC Act, including the superb fruit-dove &quot;(Ptilinopus superbus),&quot; the rose-crowned fruit-dove &quot;(Ptilinopus Regina)&quot; and the wompoo fruit-dove &quot;(Ptilinopus magnificus).&quot; The park contains the largest known population of the threatened Albert&#x27;s lyrebird &quot;(Menura alberti)&quot;, which is listed on the TSC Act. There has been a single sighting of the regent honeyeater &quot;(Anthochaera Phrygia)&quot; at the park. Due to loss of habitat it is listed as critically endangered on the TSC Act and endangered on the EPBC Act. The black and yellow bird with a wing span of 30 cm has been for the last two decades the focus of a national conservation effort to save the species from extinction.

=== Frogs ===
Two frog species are classified as endangered on the EPBC Act. One is the Fleay&#x27;s barred frog &quot;(Mixophyes fleayi)&quot;, a large frog of 90mm that relies on small streams in rainforest habitat. The other is the giant barred frog &quot;(Mixophyes iteratus)&quot;, a large frog up to 108mm with a powerful build. There is an endangered species listed under the TSC Act called Loveridge&#x27;s frog &quot;(Philoria loveridgei)&quot;, a small ground-dwelling frog of 30mm in size. The pouched frog &quot;(Assa darlingtoni)&quot; and green-thighed frog &quot;(Litoria brevipalmata)&quot; are both listed as vulnerable under the TSC Act. All of these frogs are mainly threatened by the chytrid fungus.

=== Reptiles ===

Two species of reptiles are listed as vulnerable on the TSC Act. The Stephens&#x27; banded snake &quot;(Hoplocephalus stephensii)&quot; is a one metre long tree-dwelling snake that hunts at night. The three-toed snake-tooth skink &quot;(Coeranoscincus reticulatus)&quot; is a borrowing lizard that has a body length of 23 cm and is also listed as vulnerable under the EPBC Act. 
=== Trees ===

The Nightcap oak &quot;(Eidothea hardeniana)&quot; is listed as critically endangered under the EPBC Act. It was discovered in 2000 and has a locally restricted single population on the southern side of the Nightcap Range. 15–20 million years old fossil fruits found near Ballarat, Victoria suggest that the genus Eidothea and rainforest were historically widespread. There are also several endangered species of trees on the EPBC Act, including the southern ochrosia &quot;(Ochrosia moorei)&quot; with a range from the Gold Coast to Coffs Harbour. The Minyon quandong &quot;(Elaeocarpus sedentarius)&quot; was thought to be extinct until 1992, and is found in only three nature reserves: Nightcap NP, Jerusalem NP and Whian Whian SCA. The peach myrtle &quot;(Uromyrtus australis)&quot; has a similar range to the Minyon Quandong.

=== Other flora ===
The following species are all listed as Endangered under the TSC Act: Coast Euodia &quot;(Melicope vitiflora)&quot;, &quot;Amyema plicatula&quot;, short-footed screw fern &quot;(Lindsaea brachypoda)&quot;, green-leaved rose walnut (&quot;Endiandra muelleri&quot; subsp. &quot;bracteata&quot;), narrow-leaf finger fern &quot;(Grammitis stenophylla)&quot; and tree guinea flower &quot;(Hibbertia hexandra)&quot;. The majority of these are listed because of their restricted range, and are threatened by habitat clearing, fragmentation, fire, and local extinction due to small populations and illegal collection.

== Environmental threats ==

=== Pest animals ===

Wild dogs &quot;(Canis spp.)&quot;, feral cats &quot;(Felis catus)&quot; and red foxes &quot;(Vulpes vulpes)&quot; are all predatory threats to native animals that live at the park, especially small mammals and ground-nesting birds and their eggs. These introduced predatory species can also outcompete native predators like the endangered spotted-tailed quoll. Black rats &quot;(Rattus rattus)&quot; are opportunistic feeders, eating both vegetation and animals such as large insects, lizards, birds and eggs. While rats have more of an impact on islands they still pose a threat to mainland habitats. By 2010 cane toads &quot;(Bufo marinus)&quot; started appearing around the outside region of the park but in lower numbers than at the nearby Borders Ranges NP. The cane toad is highly poisonous at every stage of its life, from egg to fully grown, and any animal that tries to eat it would likely die. Cane toads also prey upon and outcompete native endangered frogs for vital spawning habitats.
=== Weeds ===

Lantana &quot;(Lantana camara)&quot; is a weed of national significant that threatens the park, other weeds that are a significant threat include whiskey grass &quot;(Andropogon virginicus)&quot;, crofton weed &quot;(Ageratina adenophora)&quot; and mistflower &quot;(Ageratina riparia)&quot;. Weeds that are becoming a concern at the park include camphor laurel &quot;(Cinnamomum camphora)&quot;, devil&#x27;s fig &quot;(Solanum torvum)&quot; and Parramatta grass &quot;(Sporobolus africanus).&quot;

=== Fire ===

Fire is not a requirement for rainforest species to germinate or to reproduce. If a fire did occur it would change habitat conditions and have an adverse impact on threatened rainforest species like the Nightcap oak. A suspicious fire occurred in September 2014 near Minyon Falls Road at the park. Fortunately no one was harmed and it only burned dry sclerophyll forest. The park was devastated by the 2019-2020 Australian brushfire season, raising grave fears about the fate of its inhabitants. However, many of the burned nightcap oak trees managed to regenerate after the fires, with only less than a fifth dying, and some of the inhabitants such as red-legged pademelon and long-nosed potoroo were shown to not be significantly affected, although others such as the golden-tipped bat were likely negatively affected.

=== &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot; ===
&quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot; is a microscopic soil-borne pathogen (a fungus), that causes root rot of plants and may eventually lead to the death of the plant. It has now spread across much of Australia primarily in areas of rainfall above 600mm and south of latitude 30°. On the EPBC Act the disease caused by this pathogen is listed as a key threatening process and has the potential to impact the Nightcap oak.

=== Chytridiomycosis ===


Chytridiomycosis, caused by the chytrid fungus, is the world&#x27;s worst disease affecting vertebrates. In Australia it is thought that the disease led to the extinction of four frog species and is threatening the survival of at least ten more frog species. Fifty species of frogs in Australia have been identified as being infected with the chytrid fungus. The disease has been found throughout Gondwana Rainforests of Australia World Heritage area of the Northern-Rivers NSW. The disease has been found in individuals of the giant barred frog and is a key threatening process to the endangered frog. Other frogs at the park are also threatened by the disease including the Fleay&#x27;s barred frog and Loveridge&#x27;s frog.

== Management ==
The management plan for Nightcap NP is the Parks &amp; Reserves of the Tweed Caldera Plan of Management created by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service. The main objectives are as follows:

Maintain ecosystems or, if needed, rehabilitate areas in the park in accordance to the principles of the World Heritage convention and to assess the extension of Nightcap NP as potential addition to the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia World Heritage area. Promote and provide information on World Heritage Gondwana Rainforests of Australia, by signage and brochures.

Conserve the full range of native plants and animals including habitats at the park. Neighbouring land with habitat is managed via cooperative agreements. Support neighbouring landholders to protect and manage adjoining ecological corridors. Ensure that no swimming occurs downstream of Protesters Falls at the park, so that high water quality remains for the threatened Fleays barred frog.

Control and when possible eradicate weeds and replace with locally native species that would occur in the way of natural regeneration. In the park control the dispersal of the introduced Queensland maple &quot;(Flindersia brayleyana)&quot;, a tree that is grown for its timber. Control pest species (wild dog, red fox, feral cat, black rat, cane toad and invertebrate pests) in line with the Pest Management Strategy for the Northern Rivers Region of NPWS.

Prevent fire from affecting rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest and manage the correct intensity, frequency and patchiness of fire in other vegetation communities, to ensure ecological succession occurs. Complete and implement the Fire Management Strategies for Nightcap NP.
==Access==

The park has three main sections. Access to the Mount Nardi section, including Tuntable Falls and the Pholis Walk to Pholis Gap, is via sealed road from Nimbin. The park contains Old Googarna walking track past Mount Neville, and the Historic Nightcap Track from Doon Doon south through the Whian Whian SCA to Dorroughby or east to Huonbrook and Mullumbimby. From Dunoon via The Channon along Terania Creek Road vehicle access is possible to the Terania Creek Basin and a walk to Protesters Falls. Terania was the site of one of the biggest conservation battles of the late 1970s. Also in the Whian Whian SCA, Minyon Falls is a waterfall which rises from a subtropical rainforest valley. It has some popular walking tracks and a road-accessible lookout and picnic area.

<text>Nowendoc National Park is a protected area on the southern end of the Northern Tablelands and west of Nowendoc, New South Wales, Australia. It is located approximately 70 km south of Walcha and about 375 km north of Sydney.

The park is in the rugged escarpment terrain with eucalypt forests dominating the region, along with some rainforest along creeks. This park includes parts of the Myall and Callaghans Creeks which form part of the headwaters of the Barnard River.

== Access and facilities==
All access roads to the park have a gravel surface, winding and steep in places and are unsuitable for caravans. The park is in two sections. The largest section can be reached from north-west of Nowendoc to visit the Myall Creek Camp Ground or view Callaghans Canyon. The south-eastern section with Wrights Hut is only accessible by a Four-wheel drive (4WD) and obtaining a key from the National Parks and Wildlife Service for the locked gate on the trail south of Nowendoc The smaller, separate forested section is located on Millers Road.

There is a small, very basic camping area situated in a tall eucalypt forest beside Myall Creek with a wood-fired pit barbecue, but no other facilities. This and the Wrights Hut section area are accessible in dry weather with a 4WD. Self-reliant bushwalkers can explore local scenic waterfalls and rainforest. Further afield from the campground there are scenic canyons, waterfalls and heritage places.

<doc id="101090" wikidata="Q2042871" url="?curid=101090" title="Oxley Wild Rivers National Park">
<text>The Oxley Wild Rivers National Park is a protected national park that is located in the Northern Tablelands region of New South Wales, Australia in the Port Macquarie-Hastings City Council and Walcha Shire councils. The park is situated north of Sydney and is named in memory of the Australian explorer John Oxley, who passed through the area in 1818 and is one of the largest national parks in New South Wales.

The park is part of the Hastings-Macleay Group World Heritage Site Gondwana Rainforests of Australia inscribed in 1986 and added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2007.

The Oxley Wild Rivers National Park (OWRNP) was World Heritage listed in recognition of the extensive dry rainforest that occurs within the park, and the associated rich biodiversity that includes several rare or threatened plants and animals. There are at least fourteen waterfalls in the park.

== History ==

For thousands of years, the Northern Tablelands and these valleys were the tribal lands of the Dangaddi aboriginal people, whose descendants are now concentrated in the lower Macleay River. Some marked trees have been found and a limestone cave shelter has been excavated near Kunderang Brook.

In 1818 explorer John Oxley and his party tried to descend the Apsley valley, but steep gorges blocked the way until they proceeded around the head of the Apsley Falls. After Oxley passed through the cedar-getters were the first white people to penetrate these remote gorges and valleys in search of Australian red cedar (&quot;Toona ciliata&quot;) which was floated down-river to Kempsey.
There have been cattle grazing through the Macleay River Gorges, called &#x27;The Falls&#x27;, since the 1840s, with mustering points (yards and huts) occurring at Top Creek, (Sunderlands) Middle Yards, Kunderang, Left Hand, Oven Camp, Youdales Hut, Green Gully, Yarrowitch River and Front Tableland. The recently restored Middle Yards Hut was once part of the East Kunderang cattle station on the Macleay River.

In the late 19th century several gold and antimony mines were established around the rim of the gorges, at places such as Halls Peak and Hillgrove, as well as two ambitious hydro-electric schemes to power them, the remains of which can be seen today along the Styx River and at Gara Gorge.

In 1976 the Apsley Macleay Gorges were identified as being of true wilderness quality. At that stage the public protection offered to the area was limited to two small reserves in the south, and a few local council run recreation areas at sites such as Wollomombi Falls, Dangars and Apsley Falls. With future land-use undecided, the NSW Electricity Commission began surveying the Apsley Valley for a hydro-electric scheme in the late 1970s. The Apsley Gorge National Park of was gazetted followed by the Yarrowitch Gorge National Park soon after.

During late 1981 the track to the Apsley River at Riverside was improved and Elcom installed a river gauging station. The project was shelved following a land use study recommending a national park be established. In 1986 the park was gazetted to foster nature conservation, cultural heritage and tourism on the Northern Tablelands. In 1989 East Kunderang Station of passed to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and was proclaimed the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park.

In 1994 Oxley Wild Rivers National Park was inscribed on the Register of World Heritage sites, as part of the Central Eastern Rainforest Reserves of Australia (CERRA); subsequently renamed as the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia. Later of Winterbourne State Forest, also known at the Big Lease, was added to the wilderness. The remaining of Winterbourne and of Enmore State Forests are to be added to the national park. Further inclusions include Green Gully headwaters and of leasehold land in the lower Chandler River gorge. The Macleay Gorges Wilderness Area was declared in 1996 and extended in 1997 and covers over , mainly in the central part of the park.

In December 2009 a lightning strike started a bushfire in the Youdales Hut area. The hut was unaffected, but of inaccessible steep country was burnt out before it was brought under control. Another lightning strike started a large bushfire in the Reedy Creek region of the park. This fire has burnt out over of rough country.

== Geography ==

The Oxley Wild Rivers National Park lies along the Great Escarpment between the Northern Tablelands, and the east coast and has dramatic gorges and waterfalls, extensive wilderness and dry rainforest. The main rivers in the national park are the: Apsley River, Macleay River, Wollomombi River, Chandler River, Tia River, Styx River, Gara River, Yarrowitch River, Oaky River and the Kunderang Brook. There are a number of waterfalls situated throughout the park including: Wollomombi Falls, Apsley Falls, Tia Falls and Dangars Falls as well as numerous cascades. The waterfalls in the park are at their best after rains and the main ones are accessible by car.

== Geology ==

The formation of the area began with muddy sediments under ancient oceans that were changed by heat and pressure into hard rocks, then uplifted by movements of the continental plate and volcanic eruptions. This resulted in the formation of the Great Dividing Range, an undulating plateau that sloped gently to the west and fell away steeply to the east.

Erosion by wind, rain, storms and ice over millions of years carved out the plateaus of the Northern Tablelands, and rivers and streams gradually cut back the eastern edge of the tableland creating deep gorges that eventually formed one continuous escarpment. The jagged scarp is slowly retreating west and this movement can be seen today in the erosion of steep cliffs at places like Wollomombi, Dangars and Apsley Gorges.

== Flora ==

The Apsley Macleay Gorges are a converging point for moister eastern coastal and dry western floras, and some 950 native plant species have been identified, of which 36 are rare or threatened.

The rare plants found include: &quot;Grevillea obtusiflora&quot;, &quot;Acacia blakei&quot; (subsp. &quot;diphylla&quot;) (Wollomombi or gorge wattle) and &quot;Acacia ingramii&quot; which grows at Dangars Gorge. Some Australian red cedar trees may also be seen in the more remote locations. Threatened flora of the area includes the wedge-leaved guinea flower (&quot;Hibbertia hermanniifolia&quot;), &quot;Grevillea beadleana&quot; and &quot;Hakea fraseri&quot; (gorge hakea). Hillgrove spotted gum (&quot;Eucalyptus michaeliana&quot;) may be seen south of Hillgrove and in the Big Lease, north-east of Walcha. The beautiful &quot;Caladenia&quot; orchid has been spotted at Long Point.

Dry rainforests in the OWRNP contain at least 187 plant species and they are visible as dense, dark green patches of brush box (&quot;Lophostemon confertus&quot;), favouring hollows where there is shelter from wind and sun. The adaptable bird&#x27;s nest fern (&quot;Asplenium australasicum&quot;) grows in a variety of sites as an epiphyte on large trees, independently growing on the forest floor or attached to rocks. Other plants that could be found in or around dry rainforests include: native rosella (&quot;Hibiscus heterophyllus&quot;), gorge mock-olive (&quot;Notelaea microcarpa&quot;), &quot;Brachychiton discolor&quot; (lacebark), Moreton Bay fig (&quot;Ficus macrophylla&quot;), native olive (&quot;Olea paniculata&quot;), red kamala (&quot;Mallotus philippensis&quot;), scentless rosewood (&quot;Synoum glandulosum&quot;) and shatterwood (&quot;Backhousia sciadophora&quot;).

The open forest and woodlands are dominated by various trees. The main species are: &quot;Angophora floribunda&quot; (rough-barked apple), &quot;Eucalyptus retinens&quot; (Hillgrove box), &quot;Eucalyptus andrewsii&quot; (New England blackbutt), &quot;Eucalyptus caliginosa&quot; (broadleaved New England stringybark), &quot;Eucalyptus laevopinea&quot; (silvertop stringybark), &quot;Eucalyptus melliodora&quot; (yellow box) and wild cherry. &quot;Eucalyptus tereticornis&quot; (forest red gum) identified by the bark on its trunk which sheds to expose white, grey or bluish patches may also be seen, too. Epiphytic orchids may be observed growing in some of these trees, as well.

The hazardous stinging tree (&quot;Dendrocnide excelsa&quot;) is found in various locations throughout the park. This is a dangerous plant and physical contact with it should be avoided. The stems and leaves are coated with fine hairs which when imbedded in the skin cause severe pain and irritation for prolonged periods. &quot;Smilax australis&quot; (lawyer vine or wait-a-while) is another plant to be avoided as it has prickly climbing stems that are up to eight metres long and will catch in clothing or the skin.

The understorey is often sparse except for occasional &quot;Acacia&quot; (wattles), &quot;Bursaria spinosa&quot; (blackthorn), &quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot; (grass trees) and The cassinia, geebung (&quot;Persoonia&quot; spp.), &quot;Pomaderris lanigera&quot; (woolly pomaderris), &quot;Jacksonia scoparia&quot; (dogwood) and &quot;Prostanthera&quot; (mint bush) are the most common species in the area.

Because the conditions are extreme on the cliffs, quite a number of rare and uncommon shrubs are found there. These include: broadleaf hopbush (&quot;Dodonaea rhombifolia&quot;), &quot;Dodonaea serratifolia&quot;, &quot;Grevillea beadleana&quot;, &quot;Grevillea obtustiflora&quot;, &quot;Hakea fraseri&quot; (gorge hakea), climbing fig, orchids and &quot;Westringia&quot; sp. &quot;Bertya ingramii&quot; (narrow-leaved bertya) is an endangered species of shrub that is found in two locations, growing among rocks or in thin soils close to cliff-edges in dry woodland with she-oaks, wattles and tea-trees.

== Fauna ==

The park is rich in fauna, with over 350 species recorded, including 55 mammals. Oxley Wild Rivers National Park is a major refuge for the brush-tailed rock-wallaby (&quot;Petrogale pencillata&quot;), with the largest confirmed population in the Green Gully area of Yarrowitch.

Other species found in the park include bandicoots, bats, koalas, wombats and numerous small ground mammals. Quolls, common brushtail possums, sugar gliders, platypus, echidnas, wedge-tailed eagles, peregrine falcons and dingoes may also be seen.

Over 173 bird species have been recorded in Oxley Wild Rivers National Park.

There have been 38 reptile and 19 amphibian species recorded in Oxley Wild Rivers National Park. Skinks, goannas, tortoises, lizards, snakes, frogs and fish occur in the park, particularly on the river flats. A number of fish species have been recorded. Notable, is the speckled longfin eel (&quot;Anguilla reinhardtii&quot;), which breeds in the ocean with the juveniles eventually returning to the Apsley–Macleay River system.

Twelve species listed as threatened under the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 are found in the wilderness area. There are five mammals (brush-tailed phascogale, brush-tailed rock wallaby, koala, squirrel glider and tiger quoll); four birds (glossy black cockatoo, greater sooty owl, superb fruit-dove and turquoise parrot); one reptile (&quot;Morelia spilota variegata&quot; (carpet python)); and two frogs (&quot;Litoria piperata&quot; and &quot;Litoria subglandulosa&quot;). The national park is also home to the Macleay River tortoise, a recently discovered species, and a rare mammal, the Hastings River mouse (&quot;Pseudomys oralis&quot;), which is considered to be in imminent danger of extinction.

==Attractions==
Car access to the park is mainly via the Waterfall Way, east of Armidale and Oxley Highway, east of Walcha. All roads to visitor facilities are suitable for conventional cars except the 4WD tracks to Riverside, Youdales Hut and East Kunderang. A permit and key is required to gain vehicle access to these three sites.

There are several visitor entry points where visitors may enter with a 2WD car and camp overnight:

The Apsley Falls are located east of Walcha, off the Oxley Highway. Here the Northern Tablelands plateau drops precipitously into the rugged gorges carved out by the Aspley and upper Macleay Rivers which meander through the park. There is a steel stairway leading to an observation deck (with disabled access) where there are great views of the deep gorge and the falls. There are two large falls, with two walking tracks taking in the Gorge Rim Walk and the Oxley Walk, picnic facilities and camping area for overnight stays. On 28 December 2009 the steel footbridge leading to Gorge Rim Walk was washed away.

===Tia Falls===

The Tia Falls, located near Tia, east of Walcha and off the Oxley Highway. The turnoff for this road is past the Apsley Falls turnoff (travelling from Walcha). There are waterfalls, with two walking tracks taking in the Falls and Gorge Walk, being return;, and the Tiara Walk, being return, picnic facilities and bush camp sites are available for overnight stays.

===Budds Mare===
The Budds Mare campground is east of Walcha via the Moona Plains Road. The route includes of unpaved roads, which is unsuitable for standard 2WD cars, because of washouts. Budds Mare is set in bushland and a short walk takes you to the lookout which has extensive views over Gondwana dry rainforest in the Apsley River Gorge. Across the first gorge is the obvious feature of Paradise Rocks and to the north it is possible to see Round Mountain and Point Lookout. Heading to the right from the shelter shed is a track to a vantage point that overlooks Rusden Creek Gorge. There is a good walk from here down the ridge to the Riverside Visitor Area on the Apsley River, but it is only for well prepared bushwalkers with a sound knowledge of steep country. Return up the same track or follow the road from Riverside up to the top. The return routes are a demanding climb, suitable for fit, experienced bushwalkers only, carrying ample provisions. Alternatively, a 4WD vehicle pick-up may be arranged at Riverside. Facilities here include: Campsites, toilets, picnic tables, wood barbecues, a supply of firewood.

===Wollomombi Falls===

An extensive gorge, the Wollomombi Falls gorge houses two waterfalls: Wollomombi Falls itself (one of Australia&#x27;s highest), and Chandler Falls. Located east of Armidale along the Waterfall Way, visitors to the gorge are attracted by the rugged scenery, picnic sites, walks along the gorge rim trails, or hikes to the gorge riverbed. Facilities include drinking water, toilets, a shelter shed and fireplace and bush camp sites for overnight stays.

===Dangars Gorge and Falls===

The Dangars Gorge and Falls are located south-east of Armidale along the Dangersleigh Road and are home to the beautiful Dangars Falls, and the starting point for several great walks. McDirtys Walk - 6.9 km, 3 hours, medium difficulty. From the carpark at Dangars Gorge, cross the river and follow the track to the lookout above the falls (1.4 kilometres return), and Rock Wallaby Lookout (2.1 kilometres return). The track follows the gorge rim along a ridge to McDirtys Lookout (6.9 kilometres return). There are good places for picnics, camping and bushwalking. Salisbury Waters Walk - 14 km, 8 hours, difficult. This walk is an excellent introduction to gorge bushwalking, and can be undertaken in one strenuous or two leisurely days. From Dangars carpark cross the river (if the river is high do not attempt to cross), and follow the track past the turn off to McDirtys, heading out along the ridge as sign-posted to Sarum Hill Lookout (10.7 kilometres return), descending 500 metres to Salisbury Waters (14 kilometres return).

===Other campgrounds===
The Long Point campground is accessible via the historic gold mining town of Hillgrove from the Waterfall Way, east of Armidale to the Hillgrove turnoff. Head south from Hillgrove for along the gravel road. Located in a small forest clearing, this campground gives ready access to the easy Cassinia Walk; the medium difficulty Chandler View Circuit Walk; and the difficult Long Point to Wollomombi overnight bushwalk. For the latter walk a vehicle drop-off and pick-up and suitable equipment are needed. Basic track notes are available from the NPWS Armidale office. Long Point has two formal lookouts along the Chandler View Circuit walk and Cassinia Walk offering views over the Chandler and Macleay Gorges. Facilities include a carpark, shelter shed with fireplace, picnic tables with small wood barbecues, tank water, pit toilets, an information display and bush camping with firewood supplied.

4WD vehicles are permitted to access Riverside, Youdales Hut and East Kunderang Homestead where a permit and key are required. Riverside and Youdales Hut require a low range 4WD vehicle and trailers are not permitted.

The Riverside Rest Area is on the banks of the Apsley River, east of Walcha and is reached by the Moona Plains Road. The trail from Budds Mare Rest Area is a steep gravel track and a 4WD with low range is necessary. Trailers are not permitted. Fees apply, a locked gate key and permit are essential to use this trail with a vehicle. The Riverside Trail was opened in April 1997 to permit vehicle access to the Macleay Gorges area. The road down to the river shows the diversity of flora as you drop in elevation and visitors can experience groves of native hibiscus (&quot;Hibiscus heterophyllus&quot;) and get to see river bank terraces shaded with large, fuzzy box (&quot;Eucalyptus conica&quot;). Bluff Rock (or The Terrace) walk - , one hour, medium difficulty, is reached by heading north-west from the visitor area, across a gully and up the hill to the management trail which leads to the top of the bluff rock, overlooking the river and across to Paradise Rocks. Activities: swimming, hiking, fishing and photography. Facilities: 13 camp sites, toilets, picnic tables, electric/gas barbecues, wood barbecues, firewood supplied.

The Halls Peak camping area is located off Raspberry Road, east of Armidale. The very steep 4WD trail, suitable only for vehicles with a low range, continues on down to a good camping area on the Chandler River. The new facility consists of thirteen camping sites with pit fires, tables, barbecues and toilets. There are several mines in this area and the Halls Peak Mine may be seen from near the camping area.

===Youdales Hut===
The Youdales Hut is an historic pioneering timber slab walled hut that was built in the 1930s on a small pastoral run established in the Kunderang Gorges. Alan Youdale is believed to have been guided here by an Aboriginal man, and he then settled here in circa 1939. This camping ground is approximately from Walcha and can be accessed via Kangaroo Flat Road, which leaves the Oxley Highway from Walcha. The trail is narrow and steep and a 4WD with low range is necessary. Trailers are not permitted. Access is also possible via Carrai Road, Coachwood Road and the Racecourse Trail from Kempsey, or the Hastings Forest Way and Racecourse Trail from Port Macquarie. Visitor numbers are limited so bookings are essential. A permit and key is necessary to gain entry to this area and they may be obtained from Apsley Motors or the Park office, Walcha. The area caters for both picnickers and campers, with wood barbecues (wood provided), toilet and interpretation display at the hut. It&#x27;s ideal for picnics, swimming and short walks.

===East Kunderang Homestead===

The East Kunderang Homestead is set on the banks of the Macleay River, east of Armidale via Wollomombi and the Kempsey Road. Access to the homestead is along steep gravel roads and a 4WD is required along with a permit. This historic homestead built in the 1890s, of solid cedar throughout, was once the centre of a grazing empire. It has now been carefully restored by the National Parks and Wildlife Service to provide comfortable and modern accommodation. Edward Fitzgerald&#x27;s grave is uphill from the rear of the homestead near a clump of gum trees along the fence line. Edward was drowned in 1900 while returning on horseback from the mail run. The homestead may be booked for up to ten people for a minimum of two nights.

Marys View, a lookout situated on a bluff about south east of East Kunderang homestead, has perhaps the best view of any lookout of the Macleay Gorges. This lookout can be accessed as a day walk from East Kunderang. From here you have a 300 degree view almost from Point Lookout in New England National Park near Dorrigo back to Mummel Gulf National Park near Walcha. On a clear day you can see Mount Duval near Armidale, more than away. A 4WD vehicle is needed to access Marys View, from outside the national park, and it is at least a sevenhour return trip from either Walcha or Armidale and onto the Carrai tableland. There is no vehicle access from East Kunderang.

===Bicentennial National Trail===

The Bicentennial National Trail for walking and horse riding passes from Cedar Creek on the edge of Werrikimbe National Park past Youdales Hut via East Kunderang to Georges Junction on the Armidale to Kempsey road, which is a distance of some through the national park. The track is mostly unmarked but follows Kunderang Brook as it descends into the Macleay past East Kunderang Homestead in Oxley Wild Rivers National Park. The walk takes at least five days and all food and equipment has to be carried and there are numerous creek and river crossings, with some steep ascents and descents. This route generally takes at least four days to ride, and can be impassable after rain – check with Armidale or Walcha NPWS for details. Huts at Left Hand and Middle Yards are managed for their cultural heritage value, but are available for use while on the National Trail. The historic, remote Middle Yards Hut, located on Kunderang Brook deep within Oxley Wild Rivers National Park, has been restored to its original condition by the NPWS. A holding yard for horse trekkers was constructed here, along with a hitching rail, period furniture inside the hut, an outdoor barbecue and new water tank. Horses are not permitted at East Kunderang homestead.

===Gara Gorge===

The Gara Gorge is located south-east of Armidale along the Castledoyle Road off the Waterfall Way just east of Armidale. The remains of Australia&#x27;s first public hydro-electric scheme can be viewed here. Gara Gorge is a picnic area with tables, drinking water, toilets and gas barbecues. Known for scenic bush strolls and the Blue Hole which is commonly used for swimming. The Threlfall Walk follows the route of the historic 1894 hydro-electric scheme, along old embankments and through ancient cuttings, to a lookout platform high above the river. Crombies Cave, the longest granite cave in Australia at , can be found in the next small creek, Powers Creek, an easy walk to the south of the Blue Hole. As the creek flows under the fence from the surrounding grazing country, within it begins its journey underground to come out down stream. The cave can be accessed from here and negotiated for at least half its length. It contains very beautiful granite sculptures, gnammas and potholes, some big caverns and a small sandy beach near the lower exit. A climb down a small waterfall and a curving squeeze can be difficult for some to negotiate. The exits downstream can be difficult to find from the outside.

==Weeds and feral animals==

=== Weeds ===
The most significant introduced species are giant Parramatta grass (&quot;Sporobolus fertilis&quot;), lantana (&quot;Lantana camara&quot;), prickly pear (&quot;Opuntia&quot;), blue heliotrope and blackberry. Lantana was widely distributed in warmer lower areas of the park and also invaded rainforest thickets, where it has affected World Heritage values. Burrs of the &quot;Xanthium&quot; spp. are found on river flats, banks and associated tributaries.

Blackberry, giant Parramatta grass, lantana and sweet briar (&quot;Rosa rubiginosa&quot;) are being controlled using herbicide. Spraying results have been encouraging but follow-up spraying is imperative to ensure long-term effectiveness. The release of the cactus moth &quot;Cactoblastis cactorum&quot; within the park has facilitated the biological control of prickly pear.

=== Feral animals ===

Feral cats and foxes occur in moderate numbers and can impact on native fauna. Wild dogs occur in the park and include dingoes, hybrids with domestic dogs. The National Parks and Wildlife Service give assistance to nearby landowners with respect to the control of these canine species. Wild dogs are controlled using a combination of methods, including baiting, aerial shooting and cooperative fencing with neighbours. Feral pigs have a large impact on the park and cause ground disturbance that encourages soil erosion and weed invasion. Pigs are trapped, poisoned and are also controlled with ground and aerial shooting. Feral goats are confined to the upper Chandler, Styx, Oaky, and Apsley rivers. They compete with the threatened brush-tailed rock-wallabies for food and shelter. The goats are controlled using ground and aerial shooting. Over 100 head of feral horses (brumbies) have been passively trapped in the Apsley catchment then re-homed.

<text>Popran National Park is a protected national park that is located west of the M1 Pacific Motorway in the Central Coast region of New South Wales, in eastern Australia. The park is situated north of Sydney. The Park takes its name from Popran Creek which rises in the locality of Central Mangrove and then flows for approximately 24 km in a mostly southern direction until it reaches Mangrove Creek. Popran Creek flows through the Glenworth Valley, also known as the Popran Valley. The average elevation of the terrain is 135 metres.

The Aboriginal heritage is felt at every step, so a historical connection with this land cannot be avoided.

Various types of recreation are available here, from horse riding, mountain biking, fishing, picnicking and bird watching.

<text>The Royal National Park is a protected national park that is located in Sutherland Shire local government area in the southern portion of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

The national park is about south of the Sydney central business district near the localities of , and .

It was founded by Sir John Robertson, Acting Premier of New South Wales,&lt;ref name=&quot;environment.gov.au/ahdb/place_id=105893&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and formally proclaimed on 26 April 1879, a mere 7 years after Yellowstone National Park (1872) and 11 years before Yosemite National Park in the United States. Although Yosemite had been federally protected land since 1864, it did not become a &#x27;National Park&#x27; until 1890. It was the first national park to be declared in Australia. Its original name was just National Park, but it was renamed in 1955 after Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia passed by in the train during her 1954 tour.&lt;ref name=&#x27;cultureandrecreation.gov.au/natparks&#x27;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The park was added to the Australian National Heritage List in December 2006.

==Features==
The park is situated in traditional lands of the Dharawal, an Aboriginal Australian people.
The park includes today&#x27;s settlements of Audley, Maianbar and Bundeena. There was once a railway line connected to the Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra Line but this closed and was converted to a heritage tramway operated by the Sydney Tramway Museum in Loftus.

Audley can be accessed by road from Loftus, Waterfall or Otford, and there are several railway stations (Loftus, Engadine, Heathcote, Waterfall, Helensburgh and Otford) on the outskirts of the park. Bundeena and Maianbar can also be accessed by road through the park or by the passenger ferry service from Cronulla.

There are numerous cycling and walking trails, barbecue areas and picnic sites throughout the park. Over of walking tracks take in a wide range of scenery. Cycling is allowed on some fire trails and only on specially marked tracks within the Park. The specially marked mountain biking tracks are bi-directional; care should be taken when traversing these trails. A fee of $12.00 applies when taking a car into the Park.

The most popular walk is the Coast Walk, which skirts the park&#x27;s eastern edge and delivers exceptional coastal scenery. It is a 30 kilometre track, involving walking from Bundeena to Otford, or vice versa. It&#x27;s recommended that walkers allow 2 days for the walk. This walk is often done as part of The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award. The Wallumarra Track (Wallumarra is an Aboriginal word for education/protect) was constructed in 1975 to meet the growing need for Environmental Education and as a supplement to the park&#x27;s walking track system. The park is intensely used for environmental education by schools, TAFEs, universities and other groups.

The park has been burnt in bushfires on several occasions, most notably in 1939, 1994 and in the 2001 Black Christmas fires. Australian native bush naturally regenerates after bushfires and as of 2008 few signs of these fires remain visible. In times of extreme fire danger the parks service might close the park to ensure visitor safety.

There are camping sites at Bonnie Vale, North Era and Uloola Falls. These are the only places where camping is permitted within the park, and they are regulated with a booking/registration system, which requires pre-booking a site. The park charges a vehicle access fee, but is free for people on foot.&lt;ref name=&#x27;environment.nsw.gov.au/annualpass/DailyVehicleEntryFees.htm&#x27;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography, flora and fauna==

Royal National Park contains a wide variety of terrain. Roughly, landscapes in the park vary from coastal cliffs broken by beaches and small inlets to an ancient high plateau broken by extensive and deep river valleys. The river valleys drain from south to north where they run into Port Hacking, the extensive but generally shallow harbor inlet which forms the northern border of the park. When looking across the park from east to west (or vice versa) the rugged folds of valley after valley fade into the distance.

The geology of the site consists mostly of the Triassic Hawkesbury Sandstone with some sections of the park having the more recent richer Wianamatta shale capping. Deep below the Hawkesbury sandstone belt lies Narrabeen Shales which is mixture of shale and sandstone under which and within which are untapped coal seams which run right through Sydney and are mined extensively where they come closer to the surface south of the National Park near Wollongong. Sections of recent alluvium fringes of estuarine watercourse where the endangered ecological communities; swamp oak woodlands and swamp mahogany woodlands grow still.

===Coastal heathland===

Running the full coastal length of the park is a coastal heathland characterised by hardy, low-growing, salt-tolerant shrubs that spread across rocky, hard terrain with very little topsoil. The coast itself is composed mostly of high cliffs reaching a height of nearly one hundred metres at the southern end. These cliffs are punctuated by a number of fine, sandy beaches open to the ocean and providing fine swimming and surfing. Several of the beaches can be reached by road, others only by several hours of bush walking. There are a small number of rocky coves. The beaches, two of which have volunteer surf life-saving clubs and large car parks, are amongst the most visited areas of the park. These heath lands are a hotspot for many small birds that have forsaken the suburbs of Sydney such as the New Holland honeyeater.

Common vegetation on the exposed heaths on the headlands and cliffside paths include Coastal rosemary, darwinia, bracelet honey-myrtle, she-oak, white kunzea, sundew, grass trees, ridged heath-myrtle, snakehood orchids, prostrate forms of coast banksia and long-leaf matrush.

Common vegetation on top of the ancient sand dunes above the coastal path includes Silver banksia (&quot;Banksia marginata&quot;), scrub-oak (&quot;Allocasuarina distyla&quot;), silky hakea (&quot;Hakea sericea&quot;), and pine heath (&quot;Astroloma pinifolium&quot;).

Sections of rare and threatened clifftop grasslands occur along exposed and windy sites which are generally dominated by long-leaf mat-rush and kangaroo grass (&quot;Themeda australis&quot;).

Many heath specialist birds are present in the heaths which include Lewin&#x27;s honeyeater (&quot;Meliphaga lewinii&quot;), New Holland honeyeater (&quot;Phylidonyris novaehollandiae&quot;), beautiful firetail (&quot;Stagonopleura bella&quot;), chestnut-rumped heathwren (&quot;Hylacola pyrrhopygia&quot;) and the southern emu-wren.

===Littoral rainforest===
In Royal National Park, littoral rainforest (often the first type of vegetation destroyed during coastal development) has survived the ravages that occurred elsewhere during the 19th and 20th centuries. An example of this vegetation occurs in the southern stretch of the Coast Walk, often referred to as the &quot;Palm Jungle&quot;, and includes a typical tuckeroo (&quot;Cupaniopsis anacardioides&quot;) forest, under grown by coastal tea tree (&quot;Leptospermum laevigatum&quot;) and long-Leaf matrush (&quot;Lomandra longifolia&quot;).

===Exposed uplands===
Moving farther inland the terrain rises to a series of very rocky ridges and plateaus characterized by hardy, low-growing shrubs and very poor, rocky soil. These ridges are the remnants of an ancient, much larger plateau that has been deeply eroded into an extensive series of river valleys. This specific ridge land habitat is particularly significant for Sydney as most similar habitat was left unprotected and was subsequently destroyed to make way for cheap development which has made many species only found ridges threatened with extinction due to extreme habitat clearance/fragmentation. Soils on plateau land are often up to 2m deep and consist of on sandstone ridges: sandy podsol interspersed with pockets of clay derived. Clay Ridges and Plateaus also have deep Soils but are far rarer due to lack of representation in the park on these sites the soil is derived from Wianamatta clay and is considered rich land producing good quality forest.

===Valley sides===

On the sides of the steep river valleys that punctuate the uplands the terrain changes to exposed rock with collected pockets of soil. Although still fairly rocky, a large number of eucalyptus and other tree species are prevalent. Small streams are to be found reasonably frequently and understory plants cohabitate with the larger trees, although the terrain is still fairly open and easy to move through. Tree heights in this area reach an average maximum of about ten metres. The plant mix and geography conditions in this area are typical of much of the terrain in the coastal areas of New South Wales but with many widespread having highly localized species in the Royal National Park. This sort of habitat is one of the most floristically diverse in Sydney Basin.

This environment is classed as sclerophyll open forest and is divided into &quot;dry&quot; and &quot;wet&quot; sclerophyll forest. Factors that shape this habitat are primarily bushfires, low phosphorus/nitrogen levels, intense summer heat and low water levels. Resulting in a diverse floristic assembly of flora and fauna with apparently divergent paths in similar habitats, for example scribbly gums (&quot;Eucalyptus racemosa/sclerophylla/haemastoma&quot;) have smooth barked trees in a manner which reduces their chance of catching on fire while stringy barks (&quot;Eucalyptus sp.&quot;) have bark which easily catches alight clearing the way for its fire-stimulated seedlings.
Commonly encountered vegetation in this environments include but are not limited to; Sydney redgums (&quot;Angophora costata&quot;), Sydney peppermints (&quot;Eucalyptus piperita&quot;), Port Jackson pine (&quot;Callitris rhomboidea&quot;), red bloodwoods (&quot;Corymbia gummifera&quot;), &quot;Pomaderris sp.&quot;, old man banksia (&quot;Banksia serrata&quot;), hairpin banksia (&quot;Banksia spinulosa&quot;), rock banksia (&quot;Banksia oblongifolia&quot;), Sydney boronia (&quot;Boronia ledifolia&quot;), native sarsaparilla (&quot;Smilax glyciphylla&quot;), violet twining pea (&quot;Hardenbergia violacea&quot;), dusky coral pea (&quot;Kennedia rubicunda&quot;), the traditional narcotic hop bush (&quot;Dodonaea triquetra&quot;), native pea (&quot;Dillwynia sieberi&quot;), sometimes dwarf apple (&quot;Angophora hispida&quot;), parasitic devils twine (&quot;Cassytha sp&quot;.), native panic (&quot;Entolasia stricta&quot;), &quot;Lepidosperma sp.&quot; grass, forest grass trees (&quot;Xanthorrhoea arborea&quot;), Sydney waratah (&quot;Telopea speciosissima&quot;), flannel flowers (&quot;Actinotus minor&quot; as well as &quot;Actinotus helianthi&quot;), blueberry ash (&quot;Elaeocarpus reticulatus&quot;), silky hakea (&quot;Hakea sericea&quot;), variable bossiaea (&quot;Bossiaea heterophylla&quot;), bonnet orchids (&quot;Cryptostylis erecta&quot;), hyacinth orchids (&quot;Dipodium variegatum/punctatum/roseum&quot;), &quot;Pomax umbellata&quot;, native parsley (&quot;Lomatia silaifolia&quot;), edible native currants (&quot;Leptomeria acida&quot;), broad leaved geebungs (&quot;Persoonia levis&quot;), Sydney golden wattles (&quot;Acacia longifolia&quot;), gymea lilies (&quot;Doryanthes excelsa&quot;), various sheo-oaks (&quot;Allocasuarina littoralis/distyla/verticillata&quot; etc.), flax leafed wattle (&quot;Acacia linifolia&quot;), bracken (&quot;Pteridium esculentum&quot;), grey spider flower (&quot;Grevillea buxifolia/sphacelata&quot;), red spider flower (&quot;Grevillea oleoides&quot;), pink spider flower (&quot;Grevillea sericea&quot;) and native iris (&quot;Patersonia sericea/glabrata/longifolia&quot;) to literally name a few of the hundreds of beautiful flora encountered in this diverse and widespread habitat. Even certain hybrid species may be encountered such as the common &quot;Banksia ericifolia x spinulosus&quot; or the rarer &quot;Angophora costata x hispida&quot;.

Birds that frequent this habitat include Golden whistlers (&quot;Pachycephala pectoralis&quot;), yellow-tailed black cockatoos (&quot;Calyptorhynchus funereus&quot;), laughing kookaburra (&quot;Dacelo novaeguineae&quot;), eastern whipbirds (&quot;Psophodes olivaceus&quot;), New Holland honeyeaters (&quot;Phylidonyris novaehollandiae&quot;), eastern spinebill (&quot;Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris&quot;), rufous whistlers (&quot;Pachycephala rufiventris&quot;), willie wagtails (&quot;Rhipidura leucophrys&quot;), superb fairywrens (&quot;Malurus cyaneus&quot;), crimson rosellas/mountain lowry (&quot;Platycercus elegans&quot;), yellow-rumped thornbills (&quot;Acanthiza chrysorrhoa)&quot; and white-browed scrubwrens (&quot;Sericornis frontalis&quot;).

Other commonly encountered animals in this habitat include native honeybees, wallaroos (&quot;Macropus robustus&quot;), common echidnas (&quot;Tachyglossus aculeatus&quot;) as well as other far rarer species such as the koala (&quot;Phascolarctos cinereus&quot;), the dingo (&quot;Canis lupus dingo&quot;) or the predatory native marsupial the spotted quoll (&quot;Dasyurus maculatus spp. maculatus&quot;).

===Valley floors===
With rich soils and good supply of water the valley floors are cooler and more humid than any other part of the park. Large tree species such as Australian cedar (&quot;Toona cilliata&quot; prev. &quot;T. australis&quot;) and the larger eucalypt species dominate. Tree height reach 50 metres or more and a rich understory of fern, wattles, and other medium-size plants proliferate. Some small areas are classified as temperate rainforest. These areas are characterized by dense groves of very large trees including the iconic Port Jackson fig (&quot;Ficus rubiginosa&quot;) and Moreton Bay fig (&quot;Ficus macrophylla&quot;) trees. The absence of light leads to a lack of undergrowth other than a profusion of ferns. These are among the more popular areas for visitors to the park. The park service is also very careful to protect these areas due to their general rarity in the hot, arid Australian landscape.

Impressive groves of turpentine (&quot;Syncarpia glomulifera&quot;) and blackbutt (&quot;Eucalyptus pilularis&quot;) trees may be seen growing straight up into the sky forming an open canopy with widely spaced trunks. In these characteristic areas they are generally considered open forest, they may have a grassy understory, a sclerophyll shrubbery or alternatively they may have a rainforest subcanopy or a rainforest understory with growth being densest nearest to the valley floor or permanent watercourses. In these turpentine forests often hundreds of cabbage palms (&quot;Livistona australis&quot;) may be seen growing in dense tall thickets which are rarely touched by fire or they may exist as young plants in open grassy spaces which are burnt regularly enough not to form visible trunks. Rainforest pockets are dominated by jackwood and sassafras. The lilli pilli (&quot;Acmena smithii&quot;) produces a fruit edible raw. Another common species is the coachwood (&quot;Ceratopetalum apetalum&quot;) which were used extensively from Australian rainforests to manufacture horse-drawn coaches.

Birds distinctive to these rich rainforest habitats include Topknot pigeons (&quot;Lopholaimus antarcticus&quot;), green catbirds (&quot;Ailuroedus crassirostris&quot;), rufous fantails (&quot;Rhipidura rufifrons&quot;) and black-faced monarchs (&quot;Monarcha melanopsis&quot;). Two interesting birds often encountered in dense scrub or rainforest include the flightless brush turkey (&quot;Alectura lathami&quot;) and the noise mimicking superb lyrebird (&quot;Menura novaehollandiae&quot;).

Platypus once found habitat in the Hacking River. In May 2023, the species was returned to the national park under a relocation program jointly conducted by the University of New South Wales, NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service and the World Wildlife Fund. The platypus have been fitted with transmitters, so monitoring in their new environment can continue.

===Riparian forest===
In a zone generally up to 10-25m away from running water grows a distinct vegetation community often containing many rare or threatened species only found along several streams in the world. Common vegetation growing in this zone include Blackbutt (&quot;Eucalyptus pilularis&quot;), Sydney red gum (&quot;Angophora costata&quot;), water gums (&quot;Tristaniopsis laurina&quot;), bottlebrush (&quot;Melaleuca sp.&quot;), tea trees (&quot;Leptospermum sp.&quot;), woolsia (&quot;Woollsia pungens&quot;), &quot;Epacris sp.&quot;, heath banksia (&quot;Banksia ericifolia&quot;), &quot;Pittosporum undulatum&quot;, pine leafed geebungs (&quot;Persoonia pinifolia&quot;), willow leaved hakea (&quot;Hakea salicifolia&quot;), &quot;Lomandra fluviatilis&quot;, bulrushes (&quot;Typha orientalis&quot; / &quot;dominigensis&quot;), rushes (&quot;Juncus sp.&quot;), reeds (&quot;Phragmites australis&quot;) and tree ferns (&quot;Cyathea and Dicksonia sp.&quot;.)

A variety of different molluscs, crustaceans, insects, fish and birds call the riparian zone their home with a variety of life living near on in the creeks of the Royal National Park. Long-finned eels (&quot;Anguilla reinhardtii&quot;) which migrate from oceanic spawning grounds as babies and adults mature in the creeks and streams of the Royal National Park and can often be seen in the murky depths of pools and ponds along freshwater courses such as the Hacking River.

===Mangroves and salt marsh===
Mudflats exist along the shoreline of the Royal National Park which is substantial enough to sustain a simplistic system of mangrove woodlands especially along the Port Hacking Estuary with the occasional clump of stunted tree on the seaward coastline in sheltered coves. Vegetation in the mangroves consists almost exclusively of the grey mangrove (&quot;Avicennia marina var. australasica&quot;) growing up to 4m as well as the river mangrove (&quot;Aegiceras corniculatum&quot;) which is usually only found on the shoreward edge of mangrove woods or in the brackish end of the Port Hacking Estuary.

These mangroves are important nursery grounds for nearly all major angling fish including yellowfin bream (&quot;Acanthopagrus australis&quot;), flat-tail sea-mullet (&quot;Liza argentea&quot;), luderick (&quot;Girella tricuspidata&quot;) and sand whiting (&quot;Sillago ciliata&quot;) which are caught in adjoining waters as adults, mangroves also provide rich organic matter to the Port Hacking Estuary by fixing carbon into the river system through the addition of leaves into the thick rich black mud. Many crustacean and mollusc species rely on mangroves as a source of food whether by providing foraging through leaf litter, mud or direct predation of the mangrove trees and seeds. Soldier crabs (&quot;Mictyris longicarpus&quot;), semaphore crab (&quot;Heloecius cordiformis&quot;), blue swimmer crabs (&quot;Portunus pelagicus&quot;) and hermit crabs (&quot;Pagurus sinuatus&quot;) also call the mangroves home. A more casual visitor to the mangroves at high tide is the eastern sea garfish (&quot;Hyporhamphus australis&quot;) which scoots around just an inch from the surface and is virtually invisible unless viewed through a snorkel.

Dozens of different bird species may be seen foraging in the rich mudflats in and around mangrove flats many of these birds being threatened with extinction and protected by international agreements. Commonly seen bird species include Eastern curlews (&quot;Numenius madagascariensis&quot;), striated herons (&quot;Butorides striatus&quot;), brown honeyeaters (&quot;Lichmera indistincta&quot;), little egrets (&quot;Egretta garzetta&quot;), royal spoonbills (&quot;Platalea regia&quot;), white-faced grey herons (&quot;Egretta novaehollandiae&quot;), Australasian little bitterns (&quot;Ixobrychus dubius&quot;), pied oystercatchers (&quot;Haematopus longirostris&quot;), Australasian pelican (&quot;Pelecanus conspicillatus&quot;), sacred ibis (&quot;Threskiornis moluccus&quot;), chestnut teal (&quot;Anas castanea&quot;) and azure kingfishers (&quot;Alcedo azurea&quot;).

===Tidal rockshelves and rock pools===
A series of sandstone rockshelves and rock pools fringe the entire coastline and Port Hacking Estuary Line of the National Park broken on by small sandy beaches and gentle freshwater inlets. Some of the most commonly encountered molluscs in this habitat include black nerites (&quot;Nerita atramentosa&quot;), turban snails (&quot;Turbo undulata&quot;), zebra snails (&quot;Austrocochlea porcata&quot;) as well as the commercially farmed Sydney rock oyster (&quot;Saccostrea glomerata&quot;). One of the most common and distinctive seaweed species that grow among the rock pools and the nearshore rockshelves is Neptunes necklace (&quot;Hormosira banksii&quot;) a seaweed made of small buoyant fleshy bead-like structures which resemble strongly that of a necklace. Beds of the primitive sea-squirt cunjevoi (&quot;Pyura stolonifera&quot;) are common along coastal rockshelves which are covered by high tide and near sea spray. Considered the most beautiful and obvious of the Royal National Parks&#x27; sea anemone is the waratah anemone (&quot;Actinia tenebrosa&quot;) named after the waratah flower due to its corresponding flame red coloration. A common sea-star found growing in the rock pools is the biscuit sea star (&quot;Tosia australis&quot;).

The fatally toxic blue-lined octopus (&quot;Hapalochlaena fasciata&quot;), the most common of the blue-ringed octopus species in the area, can, when touched, prove to be fatal within minutes. They are nearly impossible to spot unless pointed out, and can be found in small or large rock pools. The best way to avoid stings completely is to not allow any part of one&#x27;s body to enter any rock pool.
==Park highlights==


* Audleya large, flat area at the base of one of the larger valleys in the park. The main road into the park from the north drops quickly from the heights to Audley, where it crosses the Hacking River on a weir before climbing up the other side of the valley to continue further into the park. Audley was developed in the late 19th century as a picnic area for Sydneysiders on a day trip. A large, heritage listed timber boathouse from that time still exists on the western bank of the weir and currently rents rowing boats and canoes to allow leisurely exploration of the upper reaches of the river. It also rents mountain bikes. A timber dance hall built in the early 20th century on the eastern bank is available for functions. Large picnic areas, grassy meadows and a café, rest rooms and a colony of hungry ducks complete the picnic picture. Audley is as popular with families today as it was in the 19th century. After a heavy rain the weir floods, closing the road and forcing the residents of Bundeena to drive an extra 30 kilometres to the southern end of the park if they wish to drive to Sydney.
* Jibbon PointThis is the southern head of Port Hacking and has fine views over the Sutherland peninsula. Aboriginal rock art sites are visible which were used as initiation sites, the name Jibbon stems from the Dharawal word for Port Hacking, &quot;Djeebun&quot;.
*Eagle RockA unique rock formation near Curracarong, about halfway down the length of the park on the coast. It is a large rock outcrop that looks like an eagle&#x27;s head when viewed from the side. The other remarkable feature of Curracarong are the several waterfalls which tumble over the cliffs and into the sea over one hundred metres below.
* Garie BeachOne of the most popular coastal surf beaches in the park.
* Wattamolla Beacha large lagoon tucked behind the beach, which then enters the sea via an ankle-deep stream at one end of the beach. Families enjoy playing in the calm lagoon with their young children whilst adults enjoy the clean, even surf. There is substantial parking places provided but on busy summer Sundays and public holidays, it can fill up early. Wattamolla is a sheltered cove with a sandy bar at the inlet behind which lies a lagoon fed by the waters of Wattamolla Creek and Coote Creek. Coote Creek finds its way down another valley, then as a beautiful waterfall, it rushes over a sandstone rock face into the lagoon below.
* &#x27;Figure 8&#x27; pool south of Burning Palms
*Werrong Beachthe only legal naturist beach in the park. It faces east towards the Tasman Sea. The hill behind the beach is covered in trees and undergrowth. Those who camp overnight can be woken at dawn by wallabies wandering around the campsite or a Ranger who might fine you for illegal camping.
* Lady Carrington Drive was one of the early roads through the park. It runs south from Audley, roughly following the Hacking River upstream from the weir for a distance of about to its end, where it meets the main sealed road through the park (there is limited parking at the southern end). The road was a popular carriage drive in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It had long been closed to traffic and now forms one of the most popular walking and cycling tracks in the park. It is mostly flat and well formed (although unsealed) and being a former road averages in width. It passes through valley floor vegetation and in spring is lit up by brilliant yellow displays of wattle trees and oranges and reds of the Australian native banksia trees and waratah flowers. Many secondary schools in the Sutherland Shire area use Lady Carrington Drive for an annual sports or fundraising event where their students walk from the southern end through to Audley where a large barbecue picnic is held.
*North and South Era beaches. Camping at North Era campground overlooking North Era beach in Royal National Park is allowed. North Era&#x27;s bush campsites are perfectly located for an overnight stop while walking the Coast Track.Burning Palms Beach - A common rest place for hikers travelling along the royal coastal walk. Surrounded by the distinctive palms the beach is known for the adjacent &#x27;Figure 8&#x27; rock pools.
*Winnifred Falls and South West Arm Pool – Natural formed freshwater and saltwater waterholes at the base of Winnifred Falls on South West Arm Creek.
*Royal Coastal Walk – Most popular track in the park spanning from Bundeena to Burning Palms and up to the Otford Cliffs.

<text>The Scheyville National Park () is a protected national park that is located in the northwestern suburbs of Sydney in New South Wales, in eastern Australia. The national park is situated approximately northwest of the Sydney central business district, northeast of , near the settlement of . Longneck Lagoon lies in the northern section of the park. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 9 April 2010.

==Overview==
The cultural sites of Scheyville reflect many major themes in Australia&#x27;s development since European settlement.
Beginning in 1804, the area was set aside as a public common for the people of the district. The Pitt Town Cooperative Labour Settlement was established in 1893, followed by a Casual Labour Farm where unemployed men could live while finding other work.

William Frances Schey, MP for Redfern and Darlington, helped this tradition of experimental farming continue in the form of the Government Agricultural Training Farm. The training scheme was a program to promote and assist the migration of British Youths willing to become farm workers.

After the outbreak of World War II the training farm was taken over the Commonwealth with the 73rd Australian Anti Aircraft Search Light Company and the RAAF 244 1ST Parachute Battalion being stationed there.
During the post-war immigration wave of the 1950s the lands and buildings at Scheyville became the starting point for thousands of immigrants seeking a new life in Australia.

From 1965 to 1973 Scheyville became the home of the Officer Training Unit. An intense six-month course designed to turn out officers capable of leading a platoon in Vietnam was offered to National Servicemen. After years of neglect and many development proposals for the land, Scheyville was finally gazetted as a national park in early 1996.

==History==

===Aboriginal occupation===

The land now known as Scheyville National Park and Pitt Town Nature Reserve was originally Dharug land. The Cattai clan of the Dharug people inhabited the area around Cattai Creek and Pitt Town at least 30,000-year ago. The area along the Hawkesbury Rivers and its tributaries provided fertile alluvial soils sustaining consistent supplies of food for the local Aboriginal people from the fish and wildlife stock and edible vegetation.

On two occasions, one in 1789 and the other 1791, the earliest contact with the Dharug of the Hawkesbury area was made by Governor Phillip and his party. By 1794 the first European settlers had established themselves in the area, carving out farms on the same rich soils that had sustained the Aboriginal population for thousands of years. First interactions between the Dharug and European settlers were cordial, but soon deteriorated as land was cleared for farming, trees were cut down for fuel and firewood, and the Dharug were denied access to their traditional hunting, fishing and gathering areas along the Hawkesbury River and other watercourses by European settlers.

As settlement in the area continued and spread further inland along the river, the local Aboriginal population began to diminish. This was due to a number of reasons most significantly, mortality from introduced diseases and migration of the Dharug out of the area because of the disruption to traditional lifestyle and competition for natural resources. This pattern continued and by 1851 it was reported that there were no Aboriginal people living in the Pitt Town area.

===Pitt Town village settlement===
In 1804 an area of approximately was set aside as a grazing common for the local settlers. This area originally called the Nelson Common finally became known as the Pitt Town Common. By 1889 the Common had increased to in size, and extended from Maraylya to South Windsor.

In 1893 the government resumed of the Pitt Town Common in order to establish an experimental agricultural settlement. It was declared the Pitt Town Village Settlement, operating as a cooperative farm, established to allow the unemployed and their families to make a living during the economic depression of the 1890s. Each family was expected to work the common land, clear and tend their own small allotment and contribute to the construction of community facilities in exchange for a set ration of food. By 1896 the settlement had failed due to the difficulties of farming the country.

===Labour farms and the Dreadnought scheme===

Despite the paucity of the soils for agriculture, the government persisted with endeavours to assist the needy by putting them to work on the farm at Pitt Town and in 1896 a Casual Labour Farm was established on the site of the Cooperative Farm. Here the poor and unemployed worked collecting firewood or tending pigs, for a small wage, for a limited term of three or four months. In 1905, dairy cattle were added to the farm&#x27;s livestock. A scheme was introduced to train young men in the skills of raising livestock and farming. The Pitt Town Village Settlement and later Casual Labour Farm. tell a resonant and significant story in the history of NSW as they were radical and often controversial government responses to social problems experienced by families and individuals in the economic depression of the 1890s. As such, they were a significant early example of government intervention in the welfare of its constituents.

The Farm Training for Australian Boys scheme ran until 1910 when under the vision and management of William Schey, Director of Labour and Industry in the first years of Federation, the farm was established as a training farm for young British Migrants who arrived in Australia under the Dreadnought scheme. The scheme was a State government incentive and offered the boys 13 months of training in all aspects of farming, dairying, livestock care, care and use of farm equipment orcharding and cropping. After the training, the boys were placed with a NSW farmer. Many of the existing facilities were retained to accommodate the boys and facilitate the training and farming activities although Schey oversaw the construction of a number of new buildings. his was the first of several youth migration schemes in Australia established with the sole focus of bringing youth to Australia for training in areas of skills shortage such as agriculture and domestic work. Later schemes included the Fairbridge Farm scheme, the Barwell Boys scheme and the Big Brother scheme.

The Dreadnought scheme at Scheyville ran from 1911 to 1915 when the outbreak of World War I saw a reduction in number of trainees at the farm from 800 in 1913 to 30 in 1915.

By this time the agriculture sector, like other sectors of the workforce in NSW was experiencing a serve lack of skilled workers due to the enlistment of many men in the armed forces and their engagement in active service in the European theatre of war. The government decided to call on the women of Australia to fill the skills shortage. To address these problems in the agricultural sector the facilities and training course at Scheyville were opened to the women of NSW in 1915. While there was a significant increase in women entering the workforce between 1914 and 1918 (from 24% to 34%) these were mainly into areas women traditionally worked in, clothing, footwear, food industries with some increases in clerical, retail and teaching. This resistance to stretching gender roles and taking on work outside the traditional areas was reflected in the noticeable lack of interest among NSW women in taking up the offer of training in agricultural skills at Scheyville. Between 1915 and 1917 when the incentive was abandoned, about 25 women had trained at Scheyville.

At the close of the war when the thousands of soldiers returned home many found that there were no longer jobs for them. In recognition of their service to the nation and to give them a helping hand the Commonwealth and State governments joined forces to put in place a soldier settlement scheme whereby, on application, returning soldiers were allocated by or leased land from the State Government and financially assisted to establish farms by the Commonwealth government. Many of the returnees had no previous farming experience and so during 1917 and 1918, the Government Agricultural Training Farm at Scheyville was opened to returned soldiers who received basic agricultural training there.

In 1919, the Dreadnought training scheme restarted and it continued to run up until 1929. The last five years of the scheme were funded jointly by the Commonwealth and State governments and also the British government.

In 1928 plans were drawn up by the Government Architect&#x27;s Office for a handsome set of buildings in the Georgian Revival and Inter-War Mediterranean style. These building formed the &quot;Quadrangle Precinct&quot; and comprised an administrative block, kitchen dining room and two dormitories.

While the Scheme was officially suspended in 1929 due to the looming economic crisis of the Great Depression, the farm continued to train both Australian and Immigrant boys through the 1930s when it was known as the Government Training Farm. During the 1930s many changes were made to the farm facilities including the construction of a double silo, and a new dairy and tank base.

===World War II===

With the outbreak of World War II, the farm was commandeered by the military. Initially, it was intended to use the farm for artillery and anti-tank warfare training but little record of this is available. In early 1942 the Scheyville Dreadnought Farm became the home of the newly formed 73rd Anti-Aircraft Searchlight Company.

The new and highly specialised force was an essential element in the defence of Australia particularly after the Japanese surprise air Attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. The 73rd Company used the land at Scheyville to carry out basic training while waiting for its ranks to fill.

73rd Company administration was carried out in the former farm administration building of the Quadrangle Precinct. Officers were housed in the Quadrangle dormitories suitably adapted as single person rooms. The dining room became the Officer&#x27;s mess. Other ranks were housed in tents pitched to the southeast of the quadrangle buildings. The Company moved out of Scheyville in November 1942. They first moved to a Staging Camp in Brisbane and then to Townsville where on 29 December 1942 they boarded the MV Duntroon and were shipped to New Guinea where they served at Port Moresby, Nadzab and Lae during 1943 and 1944. Initially illuminating anti-aircraft artillery they soon were also employed illuminating enemy aircraft. Their most commended function by both the Australian and American forces was their work guiding Allied aircraft, damaged in battle, back to their bases in Port Moresby and Lae. Often these aircraft had lost radar and radio contact and the lives of those airmen depended on the assistance provided by the 73rd Company men.

At the outset of the war the allied nations had no effective paratrooper forces. They were quickly convinced of the necessity to train paratroopers as Germany successfully deployed paratroopers in battles to annex Austria, Norway, the Netherlands and Crete. As part of Australia&#x27;s contribution to the defence of the British Empire and our own shores then under threat by the Japanese, the 1st Parachute Battalion was formed in late 1942 and was the first airborne combat battalion to exist in the Australian armed forces. The members of the Battalion were recruited from the ranks of the army and most of the men had already seen active service in other theatres of war. A number of those who joined the Battalion were decorated and there were ten soldiers who had earned the Military Cross for their war service.

Extensive training was required for those volunteering to join the new force. They began training with Australia&#x27;s first Parachute Training Unit at RAAF Station Tocumwal under the command of Wing Commander P. Glasscock (RAAF). Training at Tocumwal was in specific aspects of airborne combat and culminated in their first parachute jump. The paratroopers continued training for a short period of time at RAAF Base Richmond. During flight training members of the Battalion had to qualify for the winged insignia and the &quot;Red Beret&quot; by performing a total of seven jumps. Once flight training was completed the men were then marshalled at Scheyville where, while waiting for their Battalion ranks to fill, they received general combat and fitness training.

Like the Searchlight Company before them, the Parachute Battalion took over the facilities at the &quot;Scheyville Camp&quot;, utilising the quadrangle buildings for administration, officer accommodation and the slopes to the south-east of the quadrangle.

Under the command of Lt. Col. Sir John Overall CBE, MC &amp; Bar, a seasoned and distinguished Officer, the Company moved out of Scheyville in late 1944 eventually arriving at Canungra where they received training in jungle combat. The Battalion finally moved to Mareeba Airfield in northern Queensland to await orders. This was where the Battalion spent the final months of the war.

===Scheyville Migrant Holding Centre===

In the immediate post-war years there was a huge influx of migrants from Europe, people traumatised and left homeless and with few resources for survival. By 1950 Australia had received 153,685 assisted migrants who were initially housed in government run migrant accommodation. In 1949 as the need for migrant accommodation continued to grow, it was decided that the facility at Scheyville would be established as a Migrant Holding Centre. Between 1950 and 1964 thousands of migrants had passed through Scheyville Migrant Holding Centre which was largest of the migrant centres in Australia during those years.

The Quadrangle buildings were adapted to accommodate the centre&#x27;s staff and administration and prefabricated huts were located on site to house the migrants. Two large SAARS huts were installed on site, one of which contained kitchen facilities to augment those in the quadrangle building. The other huts and some new buildings housed many other health and amenity facilities including a community hall. A large number of prefabricated huts were installed on site to accommodate the migrants. A sewage treatment works was constructed on site in 1949. The installation of a sewage plant and electrical network during the post-WWII phases of use allowed the migrant camp and the later Officer Training Unit to operate as an almost self sufficient community. The Scheyville Migrant Holding Centre accommodated new migrants up until 1964.

===Officer Training Unit, Scheyville===
In 1965 Scheyville was once again commandeered for military uses, specifically to house an Officer Training Unit for National Servicemen. The OTU provided and intensive 22-week program of training in military leadership skills for select National Servicemen. The Unit was the first of its kind in Australia as previously Officers were traditionally educated and trained in the elite military schools such as Royal Military College, Duntroon and not selected from those drafted into National Service.

Between 1965 and 1973, and under the command of the noted soldier and military educationist Ian Geddes, 1871 conscripts passed through Scheyville OTU making use of the classroom-based training as well as the extensive field exercises and physical fitness training.

Once again the quadrangle buildings formed the nexus of the site&#x27;s activities. The administration block on the southern end of the quadrangle housed the Commanding Officer&#x27;s and Sergeant Major&#x27;s administrative quarters The dormitory buildings on the east and west sides were further adapted to house the Officers who provided the training, and the dining room and kitchen was the Officer&#x27;s Mess.

The Commandant and his family were housed in the old farm managers house and the Sergeant Major and family in the overseers cottage. The prefabricated buildings, a legacy of the Migrant Holding Centre period accommodated the Officer Cadets. The SAARs huts were converted to provide gymnasium facilities and the Officer Cadet&#x27;s dining and recreation facility. A parade ground was established to the north east of the quadrangle and adjacent to that on the west of the parade ground, a &quot;t&quot; shaped teaching facility was constructed.

In addition to reusing existing buildings, the OTU made extensive use of the surrounding farmlands and scrub, establishing obstacle courses, a small arms range, challenge courses and a tough rout march trail.

The Officer training was tough physically, emotionally and mentally. It was intended to remake, remould and train the potential Officer &quot;in a way that was similar to tearing the insides out of an old factory and completely renovating the insides.&quot;

330 graduates of the Scheyville Officer Training Unit served in the Vietnam War, eight of whom died in action. Other graduates did not see active service in Vietnam but went on to other areas of the Army where 130 became Lieutenant Colonels and 13 Brigadiers. Many who trained at the OTU, such as Tim Fischer and Jeff Kennet have achieved positions of importance in civilian life and attribute their success to their training at Scheyville.

Direct entry aviation cadets were also trained at Scheyville, in the same 6-month courses as the National Servicemen. There were three 12-month Officer Cadet School (OCS) Portsea courses at Scheyville in 1972 and 1973. The first six months of these courses were the same as that for National Servicemen and the latter six months concentrating on subjects more suited to careers with the Regular Army. The Officer Training Unit continued to function until 1973 (the last intake was October 1972 to March 1973), after the Australian Labor Party abolished further National Service in December 1972. However, a small number of the Regular Army officer cadets were still training there until December 1973 before travelling to OCS Portsea to graduate.

===Hawkesbury Agricultural College campus===

In 1973 the OTU left Scheyville and it was left vacant for some years. In 1977 the facility was rented from the Commonwealth by Hawkesbury College of Advanced Education which was in need of residential facilities for its students. The Scheyville residential campus began operating in 1978 and closed down in 1983.

===Post-1980===

In 1985 the NSW Police Tactical Response Group used the site at Scheyville to train and practise tactical response skills. Since this time there have been plans to develop the site as an international airport, a maximum security prison and a large housing development. These plans did not reach fruition and in 1996 the land was put under the care of the National Parks and Wildlife Service when the Scheyville National Park was gazetted.

Early management practices of the National Parks and Wildlife Service reflected the organisation&#x27;s primary concern at the time, the conservation of natural values of items under its care. Because of this NPWS allowed the demolition of a number of structures damaged by the police and military uses of the property. Since that time there has been a growing awareness of the importance of conserving all the values, including cultural heritage and natural heritage values in National Parks and the Department of Environment and Climate Change has taken up this challenge.

The Phoenix Pistol Club has been running from 1992 in Scheyville National Park, near the corner of Dormitory Hill Road and Scheyville Rd, Scheyville NSW. The club is using part of the original rifle range built by the Australian Government during World War 1 as a part of the officer training camp originally located in the quarry.

== Surviving aspects of historical significance ==
Scheyville National Park is located in the Hawkesbury region on the edge of the Cumberland Plain near the Hawkesbury River and Pitt Town Bottoms. The park comprises an area of 954 hectares and is bound by Midson Road and Scheyville Road to the east, Old Pitt Town Road and Old Stock Route Road to the West, Pitt Town Dural Road to the north and residential properties facing Saunders road to the south and boundaries with properties along Avondale, Whitmore, Greenfiled, Phipps and Old Stock Route Roads in the lower Longneck Catchment.

The park contains the largest remnant of Cumberland Plain Grey Box/Ironbark Woodland in the region. To the north west of the site on a ridge between Pitt Town and Avondale roads is a small area of Castlereagh Scribbly Gum Woodland which is considered as vulnerable. Between Llewellyn Creek, Longneck Lagoon and Avondale road there is Shale /Gravel Transition Forest vegetation containing 2 vulnerable species, &quot;Dilwynia tenuifolia&quot; and &quot;Acacia pubescens&quot;. The park also contains Longneck Lagoon, part of the Hawkesbury wetlands which is home a wide variety of birdlife and a number of threatened and endangered species. Much of the Scheyville National Park has been cleared since European settlement and supports species of introduced grasses such as paspalum, Kikuyu, Couch and African Love grass and regenerating Cumberland Plan Woodland.

While much of the fabric demonstrating the history and development of the site is archaeological, ruins or in poor condition, there is a range of evidence that clearly demonstrates the way the place used and functioned through all its phases of development

Within the larger curtilage of the Park there are 4 main areas each of which contains remnant evidence of structures, buildings and evidence of land use from all stages of the history of the Scheyville National Park. The four areas are the Longneck Lagoon area, the Scheyville Camp area, the Dreadnought Farm area and the Sewage works/Military training area.

===Area 1: Long Neck Lagoon===
The Longneck Lagoon area is located in the north west corner of the park and surrounds Long Neck Lagoon. Aside from its important natural values as a wetlands and vegetation reserve containing endangered and vulnerable species, the area contains earliest evidence of one colonial use associated with the park when it was still the Pitt Town Common. The large sandstone quarry located between the end of Phipps Road, Cattai Road and the Longneck Lagoon Field Studies Centre commenced operation in the mid 19th Century and continued well into the 20th Century after the Common was decommissioned. Stone from the quarry was used in local buildings such as St James Anglican Church and Bona Vista Homestead at Pitt Town.

The sandstone quarry is a substantial feature of this area and demonstrates quarrying techniques dating from the mid 19th Century to the 1930s.

===Area 2: The Scheyville Camp area===
The area lying between Midson Road, Old Pitt Town Road, Scheyville Road and Dormitory Hill Road. This area was the site of the Pitt Town Village Settlement and was later used by the Scheyville Government Training Farm, WWII military uses, post-WWII Migrant Holding Centre and the Vietnam War era Officers Training Unit. It contains the majority of structures and archaeological remains at Scheyville. The earliest remnant farm structures are generally located in a basin near Longneck Creek to the south east of the quadrangle buildings.

Remnants and archaeological sites in this area include;
* Allotments site and former roadway relating to the Pitt Town
Settlement Village period 1893–1896;
* Site of the old dairy and silo relating to the Pitt Town Settlement Village period, and the early Dreadnought farm period 1911–1929;
* Underground concrete tank relating to the last phase of the Scheyville Government Agricultural Training farm 1930–1939;
* Single silo, relating to the early Scheyville Government Agricultural Training farm period;
* Old dairy, Scheyville relating to the Pitt Town Settlement Village and Government Agricultural Training farm periods;
* Ruins of barn and sheep dipping area, relating to the early Scheyville Government Agricultural Training farm period;
* Supervisors Cottage and Post Office, Scheyville Government Agricultural Training farm period;
* Group of archaeological sites, relating to early Scheyville Government Agricultural Training farm era;
* Log bridge over the Longneck Creek, relating to the early Scheyville Government Agricultural Training Farm period;
* The Avenue, relating to the early Scheyville Government Agricultural Training farm era;
* Site of the social hall and tennis court, relating to the early and later Scheyville Government Agricultural Training farm era;
* Farm Manager&#x27;s house, relating to the early and later Scheyville Government Agricultural Training farm era;
* Site of orchard adjacent to the Farm Managers house, second phase of the Scheyville Government Agricultural Training farm
1919–1929
* New Dairy, relating to the third phase of the Scheyville Government Agricultural Training farm;
* Double Silos, relating to the third phase of the Scheyville Government Agricultural Training farm;
* Site of vegetable garden, pump house and existing dam, relating to the Scheyville Government Agricultural Training Farm;
* Sites of Orchards, relating to the Scheyville Government Agricultural Training farm;
* Site of poultry yards, relating to Scheyville Government Agricultural Training farm,

In 1929 the establishment of the quadrangle accommodation and facilities on the ridge marked the reorientation of the farm and relocation of land use in the area. There are a number of buildings and features in the ridge top location, often known as the Scheyville camp because of its military uses, that are still extant. These include;

* The Interwar Mediterranean style quadrangle buildings with Georgian Revival elements, (roof lanterns, door fanlights and 12 panelled windows). Designed by the Government Architects Office in 1928, these buildings use architectural elements such as the gabled roofs, long, deep verandahs which were the trademark of the Government Architect&#x27;s Office at the time.
* An important feature of the buildings is the rainwater recovery system with gutters connected into standing water tanks and underground storage tanks.
* The central courtyard contains its original path layout and the walkway connecting the dormitory with the kitchen/dining room block. The courtyard still retains the Phoenix palms which are remnant original planting and also the cypress planted in 1936.
* The administration block is located at the northern end of the quadrangle complex. It accommodated the administration of the later phase of the Government Training Farm, the WWII military uses, the Migrant Holding Centre and the Officer Training Unit. It currently houses the administrative offices for the National Park.
* The east and west flanks of the quadrangle complex were originally two dormitories for the Dreadnought Migrant Boys training at Scheyville Government Agricultural Training Farm. They have since been adapted to single person accommodate for Officer accommodation during WWII, post-WWII Migrant Holding Centre staff and later Training Officers for the Officer Training Unit.
* The Kitchen and dining room stand at the southern end of the quadrangle to the administration block. This was first used by the Government Training Farm boys and staff and later by the Officers of the 73rd Australian Search Light Company and Paratroops Battalion and later staff of the Migrant Holding centre. During the Officer Training Unit period this building was the Officer&#x27;s Mess for the Officer Training Unit.
* Two large SAARS Huts sit to the south of the Officer&#x27;s Mess/ Dining Hall. SAARS huts are prefabricated semi circular structures commonly mistaken for &quot;Nissen huts&quot;. SAARS huts are also known as Quonset huts and the two at Scheyville are the very large Quonset warehouse type huts. These two structures were installed to provide dining facilities for the Migrant Holding Centre. Timber kitchens were attached to the north end of the hut and the hut proper was for dining and recreation. In fact the whole of the western hut was used for dining and the eastern hut was a combination dining room, Adult Education Centre and recreation area. Later this area became a kindergarten. A garden/playground lay between the two huts and a boiler house was situated at the northern end of the garden. During the OTU period, the Eastern SAARS hut was divided in two and the northern end used as a Mess for regular army Other Ranks and the other end became the gymnasium. The western hut was the Cadet&#x27;s Mess and recreation area complete with bar. The garden was divided in two to provide outdoor recreation areas for the Other Ranks and the Cadets.
* The concrete foundations for the &quot;lines&quot; of prefabricated accommodation are situated on the slope to the east of the quadrangle buildings. These accommodated the migrant families at the Holding Centre and later were adapted for use by the Officer Cadets. Two ablution blocks originally constructed for the Migrant Holding Centre and later used by the army are still in situ.
* On the western side of Ridge Road across from the administration building are situated three Nissen huts which operated as a store for the Migrant Holding Centre and as stores and quartermaster&#x27;s stores during the OTU period.
* There is also an area known as Transport Compound No C situated on the western side of Ridge Road and a little south of the end of the SAARS huts. This was established by the Officer Training Unit.
* The Parade Ground area is situated on the south western side of the quadrangle building and comprises a large, level area of tarmac. This feature was constructed during the Officer Training Unit period.
* An area near the water tanks are the remains of the OTU challenge course. This was established during the Officer Training Unit period.
* The front gates on Scheyville Road and the monument in front of the Administration building. The gates were constructed during the OTU period and the Monument was established in recent years to commemorate the various military uses of Scheyville and marking the death in the Vietnam hostilities of 8 officers who trained at Scheyville.

Archaeological evidence and remnants of the Pitt Town Village Settlement, Casual Labour Farm and the early phase of the Scheyville Government Agricultural Training School are found in the basin near Longneck Creek to the southeast of the quadrangle buildings.

Fabric relating to the later phase of the Scheyville Government Agricultural Training Farm, the WWII uses, post WWII Migrant Holding Centre and OTU periods is in varying condition. The quadrangle buildings have been subject to termite activity but they still stand and are undergoing conservation works with plans to reuse these buildings. The Administration building is in good condition and is used as the Scheyville National Park Central Office.

The SAARS Huts are in disrepair but are still standing as are the Nissen huts. The garden adjoining the SAARS huts is overgrown but evidence relating to its use remains. The boilers located near the SAARS huts remain standing in a state of deterioration due to the destruction of the building originally containing them and their subsequent exposure to the elements.

The &quot;lines&quot; of prefabricated accommodation and ablutions blocks for the migrant and OTU period have been demolished ( except for one ablution block) but the concrete foundations remain which clearly demonstrates the layout and function of the &quot;camp&quot; area overall.
The Parade Ground is in a state of disrepair but still an important and eminently readable part of the landscape

The challenge course is still evident although not completely intact.

There are a number of plantings, roadways and features such as the obelisk and entrance gates that are in good condition.

===Area 3: The Dreadnought Farm area===
The area lying between Dormitory Hill Road, Midson Road, and Scheyville Road. This area was the central to the Dreadnought Farm.

This area has archaeological potential relating to the Scheyville Government Agricultural Training Farm.

===Area 4: Migrant Holding Centre Sewage Works and Officer Training Unit remnant structures===
The area between Scheyville Road, Pitt Town Dural Road, Avondale Road and Schofields Road. This area contains the sewage treatment works installed during the Migrant Holding Centre period. It also contains remnant structures relating to the Officer Training Unit period such as the rifle range and the obstacle course.

The sewage works for the Migrant Holding Centre and OTU periods is still in situ although deteriorating. Remains of the obstacle course are to be found although they are in poor condition.

=== Condition and integrity ===

The long history of European occupation and use of the area has heavily disturbed some areas and is likely to have destroyed many Aboriginal sites, however a total of 16 sites have been recorded on the national park. The highest number of sites were found on the margins of Longneck Lagoon and along Longneck and Llewellyn Creeks. The sites, which include stone cores and occupation sites, have generally been heavily disturbed by previous farming activities and floods and are not easily recognisable or interpreted to visitors. No Aboriginal sites have been found on Pitt Town Nature Reserve, however it is possible that sites and artefacts are buried beneath alluvial deposits.

A conservation plan prepared by Edds (1991) identified the following sites and structures as being of considerable to high significance and that consequently should be retained as archaeological sites relating to use of the area prior to 1929; the twin silos from the Dreadnought era (built around 1930); the 1929 Georgian revival style masonry buildings and quadrangle; the palm trees and avenue of pine trees to and around the buildings, which may have been part of the architect&#x27;s design for the buildings; the two large Nissen huts used during the migrant period; the 1929 electrical sub-station; and the small water storage tank built in 1911. Gates erected during the Officer Training period remain as evidence of the involvement of the place with the Vietnam War.

The areas now Scheyville National Park and Pitt Town Nature Reserve, like much of the fertile Cumberland Plain, have been subject to vegetation clearing since the early days of European settlement in Australia. Approximately 30% of Scheyville National Park and the majority of Pitt Town Nature Reserve are still covered with introduced and native grasses.

Most introduced plants within Scheyville National Park occur in the previously cleared areas of the park. Species include African love grass (Eragrostis curvula), blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), lantana (Lantana camara), bridal veil creeper (Myrsiphyllum asparagoides), mother-of-millions (Bryophyllum syksii), prickly pear (Opuntia stricta), paspalum (Paspalum dilatatum), kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum), common couch (Cynodon dactylon), willow (Salix spp.), oleander (Nerium oleander) and liquidambar (Liquidambar styraciflua). Blackberry is of particular concern, with large clumps occurring in cleared areas and along Longneck Creek.

Introduced animals can destroy native vegetation, compete with and prey on native animals, adversely affect the breeding and feeding of native animals, and can detract from the experience for people visiting natural areas. The use of Scheyville National Park and Pitt Town Nature Reserve as commons mean that both have been grazed by domestic stock for long periods of time. Grazing ceased in the nature reserve in 1991 and in the national park in 1997.

Introduced animals observed in the national park and nature reserve include the red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), cat (&quot;Felis catus&quot;), dog (&quot;Canis familiaris&quot;), rabbit (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;), brown hare (&quot;Lepis capensis&quot;), black rat (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot;), house mouse (&quot;Mus musculus&quot;), starling (&quot;Sturnus vulgaris&quot;), sparrow (&quot;Passer domesticus&quot;) and Indian myna (&quot;Acridotheres tristis&quot;). In addition, sheep and cattle from neighbouring properties have been occasionally observed in the national park and nature reserve. European carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;) are present within both Longneck and Pitt Town Lagoons. Carp are of concern as they are believed to compete with native species and contribute to muddiness of the water and loss of aquatic vegetation.

The national park retains its ability to demonstrate the reasons for its natural and cultural significance, and the interplay between the values for which it was established.

=== Modifications and dates ===
* 1804: Gazetted as a Common and subject to clearing and grazing
* From 1850s to 1930s: sandstone quarrying
* 1893: a central portion of the old Common was established as a cooperative farm - 3 dams established on Longneck Creek and a well dug. erection of timber housing, farm buildings and other amenities including a schoolhouse in 1894.
* 1896: the area became a Casual Labour farm
* 1911: The farm taken over by the Scheyville Government Agricultural Training Farm and while retaining some existing facilities developed many new buildings including dormitories, dining room, ablutions blocks, recreation facilities, farm manager&#x27;s residence and many new farm buildings. The Avenue was established as the main roadway into the farm.
* 1928–1929:
** construction of the quadrangle buildings containing two large dormitories and administration wing and a kitchen dining room
** reorientation of farming activities out of the area around Longneck creek to the ridgetop. Many new farm buildings erected including the double silos new dairy and piggery. Importantly a new entrance and roadway was constructed (Ridge Road) superseding the Avenue as the way into the farm.
* WWII: Quadrangle buildings adapted to provide accommodation for Officers and an Officers Mess and a sergeants&#x27; mess.
* In 1949 in preparation for the use of Scheyville as a Migrant Holding Centre a substantial number of prefabricated huts were installed on site for use as accommodation. Two SAARS huts were installed and adapted as dining and recreation accommodation and later to house a kindergarten.
* 1949: quadrangle buildings further modified to meet need of Migrant Holding Centre Staff
* All these buildings were again adapted to suit the needs of the Officer Training Unit when it took up residence in 1973. The Farm manager&#x27;s residence was at this time refurbished to house the Commandant. Physical training courses and small firearms ranges were set up in the paddocks surrounding the Scheyville camp.
* In 1977–78 the quadrangle buildings and prefabricated hut accommodation was refurbished for use by the Hawkesbury CAE.
* During the latter half of the 1980s the Police Tactical Response Group used of the site a number of the buildings in this area were damaged.
* In the initial years of NPWS management of the site (from 1996) a number of the hut buildings were demolished.

== Heritage listing ==
Scheyville National Park is of State heritage significance as it demonstrates a continuous history of significant use since pre-European settlement when the area supported the Dharug people with plentiful food supplies. The park also contains a number of historic features and places which demonstrate the early settlement of the Cumberland Plain, farming, defence and migrant uses of the area, and is significant as a relatively large surviving element of the first commons declared in the colony. The ongoing use and development of the area closely reflects and articulates the economic and agricultural development of the colony and later the development of the nation in relation to its autonomy, defence and populating the land. It is a rare example of a site demonstrating the continuous layers of history which reflects the history of the State and the Nation.

In addition to its culturally historic values, the Scheyville National Park&#x27;s natural values demonstrate a significant phase of evolution in the natural history of the Hawkesbury area. The park contains the largest and most intact remnants of Cumberland Plain native plant and animal communities which once dominated Western Sydney. As such it offers a living snapshot of the early natural history of Western Sydney and the State.

The state heritage significance of the Scheyville National Park is enhanced through its close association with a number of people important to the history and development of the colony and later State and Nation such as Governor Phillip King, William Francis Schey, Sir John Overall, Brigadier Ian Geddes, Tim Fischer and Jeff Kennet. The Park has aesthetic significance at a State level as an extensive landscape of woodlands and wetlands with many birds and wildlife.

The place retains significant and special associations to a number of identifiable groups of people located through the State such as the former Dreadnought Boys, members of the 73rd Searchlight Company and 1st Parachute Battalion, a number of post-WWII migrants to Australia and former Officer Training Unit cadets. It is of State heritage significance for these strong social associations.

The site has State heritage significance for its potential archaeological evidence of Aboriginal occupation as well as potential archaeological resource relating to all layers of the site&#x27;s rich history as a Common, a farming concern, military uses and migrant hostel. This potential resource is capable of delivering a deeper understanding of the history of the site and the way in which it was used over time.

The site is of State heritage significance as a rare and unique site containing evidence of all layers of significant historical use which closely reflects the history of the State and the Nation. It is also rare as a site containing the most extensive remnant vegetation on the Cumberland Plain and providing habitat for endangered vegetation and birdlife.

The park is significant as a representative example of all its land uses over time, including its most recent use as a National Park. It is representative of the national park concept that was introduced into Australia through the establishment of the (Royal) National Park in 1879.

Scheyville National Park was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 9 April 2010 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

Scheyville National Park is of State heritage significance as it demonstrates a continuous history of significant use since pre-European settlement when the area supported the Dharug people with plentiful food supplies. The park also contains a number of historic features and places which demonstrate the early settlement of the Cumberland Plain, farming, defence and migrant uses of the area, and is significant as a relatively large surviving element of the first commons declared in the colony. The ongoing use and development of the area closely reflects and articulates the economic and agricultural development of the colony and later the development of the nation in relation to its autonomy, defence and populating the land. It is a rare example of a site demonstrating the continuous layers of history which reflects the history of the State and the Nation.

The park is of historic significance at a state level as a number of the Parks boundaries are those of the Nelson (later Pitt Town) Common declared in NSW by Governor King in 1804. The 6 commons declared at that time were the earliest officially declared in the Colony and the 954 ha Scheyville National Park is the largest unsettled remnant of those Commons. In addition, land uses of the colonial common such as quarrying are still evident.

Scheyville National Park is of State heritage significance as the site of three rare and often controversial social and agricultural ventures in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: the Pitt Town Co-operative Labour Settlement for the unemployed; a Casual Labour Farm for men who could not find work through ill health; and the Scheyville Government Agricultural Training Farm, a Dreadnought Farm for English boys, the earliest of the child immigrant training farms to operate and an agricultural; training farm for women during WWI. It was also one of the major migrant reception centre in Australia during the 1950s and early 1960s.

Scheyville National Park is historically significant at a State level for its long associations with the military forces, being used as a military training camp during World War II for Australia&#x27;s first parachute battalion and the 73rd Search Light Company which saw distinguished Service in New Guinea during WWII. It was also the first officer training School for National Servicemen during the Vietnam War.

In addition to these culturally historic values, the Scheyville National Park&#x27;s natural values demonstrate a significant phase of evolution in the natural history of the Hawkesbury area. The park contains the largest and most intact remnants of Cumberland Plain native plant and animal communities which once dominated Western Sydney. As such it offers a living snapshot of the early natural history of Western Sydney.

The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales&#x27;s history.

Scheyville&#x27;s historic significance at a State level is enhanced through its association with a number of groups and individuals important in the history of NSW. Scheyville National Park is significant for its association with the Dharug Nation who occupied the area for at least 13,000 years prior to colonial settlement, and for the ongoing associations between contemporary Dharug communities and the parklands (HO)

The first important figure associated with the site is Governor King who reserved an area which includes the Scheyville National Park as a Common in 1804.

The driving force in establishing the Dreadnought scheme and Scheyville Agricultural training farm for young British migrants was William Schey. Schey was keenly involved in the politics of labour and industry from late 1877 through to the early decade of the 20th century. He was a pioneering unionist with the Railways and Tramways Employees Association, a parliamentarian tirelessly campaigning for the 8-hour day. He became Chief Labour Commissioner in the late 1890s and Director of State Labour Bureau in the first years of the new Federation.

The Commander of the 1st Parachute Battalion, the first airborne combat troop in Australia which was encamped at Scheyville was Lt. Col. Sir John Overall who had received the Military Cross and Bar for distinguished Service in WWII. In civilian life he returned to his work as a distinguished architect where his work with the National Capital Development Commission made a significant contribution to the development of Canberra. He was awarded the RAIA Gold Medal in 1982 and played an important part in the development and oversight of the construction of the new Parliament House.

The first and longest Commandant of the OTU at Scheyville was Brigadier Ian Geddes, a soldier with a long and distinguished record of active service during WWII both in Europe and Asia, during the Malayan Emergency and finally in Vietnam. In Vietnam he headed a team of 128 members of the Australian Assistance Group whose task it was to instruct South Vietnamese and Cambodian Troops before the ceasefire discussion were concluded. Geddes also had a long and influential career in military education at the Joint Services Staff College in Canberra, Scheyville OTU and has several achievement awards in his honour and also a number of military educational facilities named after him.

The leadership training offered by the Officer Training Unit at Scheyville produced many strong and well-equipped leaders who used their skills during the Vietnam war and well after, two significant graduates who have gone on to influence the direction of the State and Nation are Jeff Kennet and Tim Fischer.

Scheyville National Park is significant for its associations with community groups involved in the environmental conservation movement in western Sydney during the late 20th century, including the National Parks Association and Concerned Residents Against Development of Longneck Lagoon (CRADLE).

The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

Scheyville National Park is of state significance as an extensive landscape of woodlands and wetlands that crown the high land above the rural and village countryside of the Pitt Town Bottoms and the Hawkesbury Valley. Within the park the landscapes have aesthetic value for the combinations of eucalypt woodlands, open grasslands and shady glades with reedy water bodies and many evident birds and other wildlife. Because of its height above the surrounding plains and valleys, there are clear views over the Hawkesbury River and villages such as Pitt Town and Windsor towards the rugged escarpments and peaks of the Blue Mountains. It is an increasingly rare example of such landscape combinations on the western Cumberland Plain.

The inter-war period built complex in the centre of the national park has aesthetic significance as an example of institutional design in a Mediterranean style, with all the principal buildings hierarchically arranged around a central courtyard on top of a commanding knoll. The complex design is supported by the arrangement of the central driveway which features sandstone gateways from the Officer Training establishment and a central memorial stone obelisk that commemorates the various military forces previously stationed in the complex.

The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

Scheyville National Park is of local and regional significance for its associations with contemporary Aboriginal communities in Western Sydney for whom it retains memories and physical evidence of historical settlement by the Dharug people, and of their resistance and adaptation to colonial settlement of the Hawkesbury Valley and Cumberland Plain.

Scheyville National Park meets this criterion of State significance because it retains a significant and special association to a number of identifiable groups of people who are now located throughout NSW and beyond.

While their number is diminishing the place has a special association for the surviving former Dreadnought boys who trained there and later went onto work on farms throughout NSW. Those surviving are mainly from the period 1919 to 1939 and their oral testimony evidences the lasting association they have with Scheyville as a significant formative experience in their lives and careers.

Similarly, the place is held in regard by the members of the 73rd Searchlight Company and the 1st Parachute Battalion who camped and trained in the fields surrounding the &quot;Scheyville camp&quot;.

The buildings and surrounds at Scheyville hold particular special meanings and memories for thousands of migrants who made Scheyville their home when they first settled in Australia. A demonstration of the lasting association many migrants have with the place was the very well attended &quot;Back to Scheyville Day&quot; held in 2005 where many people revisited their experience of first settling in Australia and reconnected with old friends and acquaintances.

Scheyville has enduring association with the former officer cadets who trained there. The nature of the training at Scheyville was so dramatic that all cadets who have contributed to the oral history of their time at Scheyville note their time there as profoundly character and life-changing. The OTU regularly holds reunions at the site and have established a monument at Scheyville to commemorate their fellow Officers who died in action in Vietnam as well as those associated with the earlier military uses of the site, the 73rd Searchlight Company and the 1st Parachute Battalion.

The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

Scheyville National Park is of significance for the research potential of the archaeological evidence of Aboriginal occupation found on the margins of Longneck Lagoon and along Longneck and Llewellyn Creeks, including stone cores and occupation sites.

It also contains significant archaeological potential, known archaeological resources and remnant fabric which can provide an understanding of the layout and functioning of the place during all its periods of use including its earliest European use as a Common and then later when it accommodated the Pitt Town Settlers. There is archaeology and remnant fabric relating to its 3 phases of use as a Government Agricultural Training Farm for British youth and also of its periods of military use and as a Migrant Holding Centre.

In addition, the Park as the largest intact area of Cumberland Plains vegetation the area is an important research resource to study and protect several rare and endangered species of fauna and flora. The natural areas of the national park are becoming increasingly significant as areas for researching the impacts of changing flora and fauna composition and ecological communities in response to urbanisation and other human-induced environment changes (HO).

The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

It meets this criterion of State significance because as it is a site unique in its ability to demonstrate all the layers of its significant historical use which closely reflect and articulate the history of the state and the nation. Scheyville National Park is of State significance for the rarity of several of its constituent elements.

The naturally vegetated areas of the national park represent the most extensive remnant of vegetation on Wianamatta Shale remaining on the Cumberland Plain, notably the Cumberland Plain Grey Box/ Ironbark Woodland (listed as an endangered community under the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995), as well as Castlereagh Scribbly Gum Woodland and Shale/Gravel Transition Forest.

The national park protects three threatened native plants and a number of regionally rare plant species. Ten birds listed under the Threatened Species Conservation Act have been recorded in the national park (PoM).

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

The Park is of significance as a representative example of all its land uses over time; as a colonial Common, a cooperative farming concern and agricultural training farm, as an encampment site for the military forces during WWII, as a migrant holding hostel for displaced persons at the end of WWII and as an Officer Training Unit specifically set up for National Servicemen during the Vietnam War.

Scheyville National Park is of local and regional significance for its flora and fauna communities that are representative of the native ecologies of the Cumberland Plain.

The park itself is representative of the national park concept that was introduced into Australia through the establishment of the Royal National Park in 1879, as evidenced by its establishment in 1996 as one of the most recent metropolitan national parks gazetted in New South Wales .

<text>The South East Forests National Park is a national park located in between the Monaro and South Coast regions of New South Wales, Australia. The national park is situated southwest of Sydney. It features high quality old growth eucalyptus forest and remnant patches of temperate rainforest.

==History==
The park was created in 1997 by the amalgamation of Genoa, Tantawangalo, Bemboka, Yowaka and Coolangubra National Parks, all of which had been gazetted in 1994. Genoa National Park in turn was the result of the amalgamation of Nalbaugh and Nungatta National Parks, which had been established in 1972 and 1973 respectively.

Until 1968, much of the inland southeastern corner of New South Wales was rugged forest terrain known as the Wallagaraugh Wilderness, and was vacant crown land. At the time, a scientific committee appointed by the New South Wales state government recommended the area of around be protected as a national park. However, the Japanese company Harris-Daishowa sought to log the area for woodchips, and most of the land was categorised as state forest, with only Nalbaugh and Nungatta National Parks declared in what is now South East Forests National Park. Nearby, Mount Imlay and Beowa National Park were gazetted.

Logging began in October 1969, and continued for 25 years despite increasing opposition. The Unsworth Labor State government had proposed an park as a reelection promise in the 1988 state election, but was not reelected. Later, under the Fahey government, the Genoa, Tantawangalo, Bemboka Yowaka and Coolangubra national parks came into existence in 1994.

Combined with the adjoining Coopracambra National Park located in Victoria across the Black-Allan Line, the South East Forests National Park forms one of the largest contiguous areas of high quality wilderness in south-eastern Australia that spans from in New South Wales to the town of in Victoria.

==Environment==
The region is known for its variety of eucalypt species, and wet sclerophyll (eucalypt) forests cover 42% of the park. Temperate rainforest is found in sheltered areas, and subalpine bogs at high elevations.

A great variety of animals are found within the park boundaries, including threatened species such as the smoky mouse (&quot;Pseudomys fumeus&quot;), and other species which are vulnerable in New South Wales such as the olive whistler (&quot;Pachycephala olivacea&quot;). The park forms part of the Ulladulla to Merimbula Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for swift parrots.

== Name ==

The legal name of the park is &quot;South East Forest National Park&quot;, as prescribed in the Act of the New South Wales Parliament establishing the park. Common usage typically pluralises &quot;Forests&quot;, which is used in official signage for the Park.

<doc id="101099" wikidata="Q972962" url="?curid=101099" title="Sturt National Park">
<text>The Sturt National Park is a protected national park that is located in the arid far north-western corner of New South Wales, in eastern Australia. The national park is situated approximately northwest of Sydney and the nearest town is , away.

Established in 1972, the park is named in honour of Charles Sturt, a colonial explorer. The park features typical outback scenery of flat, reddish-brown landscapes. It was resumed from five pastoral properties. The Sturt National Park was featured in British documentary called &quot;Planet Earth&quot;. The Dingo Fence was built along the national park&#x27;s northern boundary.

==Flora==
Flora consists mostly of mulga bushland and arid shrubland, particularly Saltbush. After good rain the harsh landscape is transformed by the growth of wildflowers including Sturt&#x27;s desert pea.

==Fauna==
===Mammals===
At least 31 species of mammal have been recorded in the park. The most obvious to visitors include the red kangaroo, western grey kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo and Euro. Other terrestrial mammals found at Sturt NP also include the dingo, stripe-faced dunnart, paucident planigale, narrow-nosed planigale, dusky hopping mouse and desert mouse. Nine species of bat have also been recorded in the park, including the eastern long-eared bat, little broad-nosed bat, yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat, inland forest bat and little pied bat. Several introduced pest species occur, including the European fox, European rabbit, feral cat, feral goat and feral pig.

Several mammal species that previously occurred prior to the arrival of Europeans are also being reintroduced into the park. These include the Crest-tailed Mulgara, Greater Bilby, Western barred bandicoot, Burrowing bettong, Greater stick-nest rat, Golden bandicoot and Western quoll.

===Reptiles and amphibians===
At least 67 species of reptile have been recorded in the park. Commonly found species include the central bearded dragon, shingleback, tree dtella and Bynoe&#x27;s gecko. The Gould&#x27;s goanna, ringed brown snake, whip snake and mulga snake are also common, but less likely to be seen. Several cryptic species also inhabit the park, such as the Interior blind snake and woma python.

Several frog species can also be found in the park, including the desert tree frog, common around the residential and accommodation areas, the burrowing frog and the water-holding frog.

===Birds===
At least 197 bird species have been recorded in the park, with the most obvious to visitors being the emu. Significant ground-nesting birds include the inland dotterel, stubble quail, Australian pratincole and spotted nightjar. 13 species of parrot, which rely on tree hollows for nesting, have also been recorded in the park. These include flocks of cockatiels, galahs, corellas and less frequently budgerigars that appear after rain events. A wide variety of birds of prey are also present in the park, including the wedge-tailed eagle, black-breasted buzzard, Grey falcon, Australian hobby and nankeen kestrel.

The Ramsar-listed Lake Pinaroo, present within the park, also acts as an important stopover and drought refuge for at least 40 species of waterbird, including several threatened species, such as the Australian painted-snipe. Other waterbird species also include the Freckled duck, Blue-billed duck and Caspian tern.

===Invertebrates===
Ants, termites, native bees and spiders are all common within the park, however existing knowledge of species and interactions are poor. The aquatic invertebrates found in the park include the common yabby and freshwater crab, while populations of shield shrimp can commonly be found in temporary water pools after rain events.

==Attractions==
The park contains aboriginal middens and stone relics. There are many walking trails and an extensive network of roads. Most roads in the park are gravel with some sandy stretches and can be driven on with a conventional vehicle. A 4WD vehicle is needed after heavy rains.

In the east of the park are flood plains, dotted with occasional trees which then give way to small rocky gorges and creek beds. Located here is Mount Wood, Gorge Lookout and the Mount Wood camping ground.

Towards the middle of the park, The Olive Downs, or &quot;Jump Up&quot; country has flat topped mesas rising up to above the surrounding plains, granite outcrops and flat valleys. The Jump Ups are the remains of an ancient mountain range. The park&#x27;s second camping site called Dead Horse Gully camping ground is located here. Amongst the boulders north of Tibooburra is another camping ground. All camp grounds have toilets, gas barbecues and water provided.

In the far west of the national park, the gibber plains are replaced by sandhills of the Strzelecki Desert. Cameron Corner is a remote but popular tourist destination where the states of New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland meet. Also in this part of the park is Fort Grey—the fourth camp ground and a heritage site. The holding yards visible here and a remnant from the explorer Charles Sturt. The fort is a stockade that was built to protect Sturt&#x27;s supplies and prevent the exploration party&#x27;s sheep from wandering away. While searching for a fabled inland sea, Captain Charles Sturt, after whom the park is named, spent a year in the area. Fort Grey is sited on the edge of the ephemeral, and Ramsar-listed, Lake Pinaroo - an important breeding and drought refuge for waterbirds when it contains water.

==Heritage listings==
The Mount Wood Station is a heritage-listed former cattle station in the national park.

==Conservation projects==
===Wild Deserts program===

The Wild Deserts program is an ongoing program aiming to reintroduce 7 locally extinct mammals back into Sturt National Park. A partnership between the University of New South Wales and Ecological Horizons, in collaboration with the Office of Environment and Heritage and Taronga Conservation Society, the project is using large fenced exclosures to assist with the reintroduction. The species being reintroduced include the Crest-tailed Mulgara, Greater Bilby, Western barred bandicoot, Burrowing bettong, Greater stick-nest rat, Golden bandicoot and Western quoll.

<doc id="101100" wikidata="Q746452" url="?curid=101100" title="Sydney Harbour National Park">
<text>The Sydney Harbour National Park is an Australian national park comprising parts of Port Jackson, Sydney and its foreshores and various islands. The national park lies in New South Wales and was created progressively, from 1975.

The national park protects the landforms of Bradleys Head, Clark Island, Dobroyd Head, Fort Denison, Georges Head, Goat Island, Middle Head, Nielsen Park, Rodd Island, Shark Island, Sydney Heads including the Quarantine Station at North Head and The Gap bluff at South Head. The national park also protects the waterway between North Head and Dobroyd Head, defined as the North Sydney Harbour Aquatic Reserve. Parts of the national park lie outside the harbour and face the Tasman Sea.

The national park is managed by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service.

==History==

Residential development has impacted a significant amount of the harbour foreshores over many years. Much of what remained was preserved partly due to the presence of military bases, and partly because of the work of conservationists. Early conservationists were responsible for stopping mining at Ashton Park in the 19th Century. Other places were saved because of people such as Niels Neilsen, who became the New South Wales Minister for Lands and a strong advocate of a public reserve around Sydney Harbour. Nielsen was ahead of his time when he used the phrase &quot;national park&quot; in regard to the harbour foreshores, but Sydney eventually caught up with him.

It was not possible to undo all the damage done in past decades, but there was still much that could be preserved, and the 1960s were a particularly active time in this regard. In 1965 the Government of New South Wales began buying land around the foreshores, and the National Trust suggested a national park in 1968. In the following year, the NSW Government announced a plan whereby it would buy Commonwealth land around the harbour. The Sydney Harbour National Park was finally gazetted in 1975, with Nielsen Park at Shark Bay being added in 1978. Extra land was transferred from Commonwealth to State Government control, and added to the national park in 1979; the historically important quarantine station at Manly was added in 1984.

==Features==
The national park is renowned for its sheltered beaches, tranquil picnic spots, rich Aboriginal, colonial and military heritage, aquatic reserves and harbour islands.

The Guringai Resting Places, at both Reef Beach and Quarantine Station, are Aboriginal reburial sites where ancestral remains have been returned to Country. Access to the Aboriginal burial sites is restricted at the request of the Aboriginal community.

Military fortifications, at the Georges Head Battery, Fort Denison, and North, Middle and South Heads stretch back to the early years of the colony. At the Quarantine Station there are archaeological features and over a thousand engravings. Historic sites include Greycliffe House, erected at Shark Bay by the Wentworth family in neo-Gothic style during the 1850s; and the mast of the first at Bradleys Head. There is also a swimming beach at Nielsen Park, a restaurant and a cafe.

<text>Tapin Tops National Park ( or ) is a national park that is located in the Mid North Coast region of New South Wales, Australia.

==Location and features==
The Tapin Tops National Park is situated approximately northeast of Sydney, with the closest town being . Access to the park from Wingham is reached via Elands Road, Wherrol Flat Road, Dingo Tops Road and Knodingbul Road, generally unsealed roads accessible via 2WD vehicles. The park is bounded by the Bulga, Knorrit, and Dingo state forests to the north, south, and southwest respectively, and by Killabakh nature reserve to the east.

Within the park are a number of threatened species including the common and little bent-wing bat and greater broad-nosed bat, the spotted-tailed quoll, the koala, the Parma wallaby, the red-legged pademelon, the glossy black cockatoo, the wompoo fruit dove, and the powerful owl. Threats to these species habitat led to a blockade of logging in the Dingo and Bulgar Forests in 1993, sections of which were added to the park.

Scenic lookouts such as Rowley&#x27;s Peak provide panoramic views via a platform with a 360–degree view, across and the Tasman Sea to the east, the catchment area of Caparra Creek to the southeast, and the extensive forested hinterland toward in the west. The platform has an estimated elevation of .

Mountain Brush circuit is a 15-minute walk through a rainforest which contain red cedar and coachwood, brush box, soft corkwood and the yellow carabeen.

Camping is permitted in the Dingo Tops campground. A walking track from Potoroo Falls picnic area can be accessed alongside the Little Run Creek to view Potoroo Falls, approximately upstream. Several swimming holes are also located in the area.

Parts of the Rowleys and Nowendoc rivers and the Dingo and Bobin creeks lie within the Tapin Tops National Park.

==Etymology==
The traditional custodians of the land now containing the Tapin Tops National Park are the Australian Aboriginal Birpai people of the Bundjalung nation. &quot;Tapin&quot; is the Aboriginal Kattang word meaning dingo, a subspecies of the grey wolf.

<doc id="101104" wikidata="Q1134729" url="?curid=101104" title="Thirlmere Lakes National Park">
<text>The Thirlmere Lakes National Park is a protected national park that is located in the Macarthur region of New South Wales, in eastern Australia. The national park is situated approximately southwest of the Sydney central business district, and just to the west of . It was gazetted in 1972 as Thirlmere Lakes State Park, before being subsequently reclassified as a national park.

==History==

The national park is one of the eight protected areas that, in 2000, was inscribed to form part of the UNESCO World Heritagelisted Greater Blue Mountains Area. The Thirlmere Lakes National Park is the most southeasterly and the smallest of the eight protected areas within the World Heritage Site.

===Crisis===
Two of the lakes have dried out since the mid 1980s due to removal of groundwater in the region secondary to coal mining at the Tahmoor Colliery. The local community is investigating plans to revive the lakes, which might take decades otherwise.

==Features==
The main feature of the park are the lakes, thought to have formed around 15 million years ago by geological activity, the land lifting and largely cutting them off from the local river system. Their outflow is reduced to the small Blue Gum Creek, which flows west into the Little River in the adjacent Nattai National Park to the west.

The lakes and their environs contain an unusual and diverse array of flora and fauna. It contains the rare freshwater sponge &quot;Radiospongilla sceptroides&quot;, and is notable for an absence of freshwater snails. The lakes contain the rare watershield (&quot;Brasenia schreberi&quot;) and are lined with rare species such as the grey sedge (&quot;Lepironia articulata&quot;) and the wooly frogsmouth lily (&quot;Philydrum lanuginosum&quot;). The habitat provides a home for the otherwise scarce Australasian bittern (&quot;Botaurus poiciloptilus&quot;), and migratory Latham&#x27;s snipe &quot;Gallinago hardwickii&quot;.

The habitat around the lakes is open sclerophyll forest, the dominant trees being rough-barked apple (&quot;Angophora floribunda&quot;) nearby and sydney peppermint (&quot;Eucalyptus piperita&quot;) and red bloodwood (&quot;Corymbia gummifera&quot;) on elevated areas. The understory species include many familiar sydney sandstone flora such as members of the genera &quot;Banksia&quot;, &quot;Acacia&quot;, pea flowers, and the New South Wales waratah (&quot;Telopea speciosissima&quot;)

<text>Tomaree is a national park located in New South Wales, Australia, northeast of Sydney in the Port Stephens local government area. It is located on the shores of the Tasman Sea, extending north from Fishermans Bay to Shoal Bay passing through Boat Harbour, One Mile, Nelson Bay and Fingal Bay.

Most entry points to the park are indicated by signs installed by the NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service which usually indicate any activities that may be prohibited within park boundaries. One can for a walk on the beach or do whale watching, and one can also come across koalas dozing in the trees.

Two prominent locations in the park are Point Stephens Light, a lighthouse built in 1862 and the Tomaree Head Fortifications, World War II gun emplacements on Tomaree Head which were built in 1941, the location of the No. 20 Radar Station RAAF.

This is the traditional land of the Aboriginal people of Worimi, and provides important resources such as food, medicine and shelter.

<text>Dentition pertains to the development of teeth and their arrangement in the mouth. In particular, it is the characteristic arrangement, kind, and number of teeth in a given species at a given age. That is, the number, type, and morpho-physiology (that is, the relationship between the shape and form of the tooth in question and its inferred function) of the teeth of an animal.

==Terminology==
Animals whose teeth are all of the same type, such as most non-mammalian vertebrates, are said to have &quot;homodont&quot; dentition, whereas those whose teeth differ morphologically are said to have &quot;heterodont&quot; dentition. The dentition of animals with two successions of teeth (deciduous, permanent) is referred to as &quot;diphyodont&quot;, while the dentition of animals with only one set of teeth throughout life is &quot;monophyodont&quot;. The dentition of animals in which the teeth are continuously discarded and replaced throughout life is termed &quot;polyphyodont&quot;. The dentition of animals in which the teeth are set in sockets in the jawbones is termed &quot;thecodont&quot;.

==Overview==
The evolutionary origin of the vertebrate dentition remains contentious. Current theories suggest either an &quot;outside-in&quot; or &quot;inside-out&quot; evolutionary origin to teeth, with the dentition arising from odontodes on the skin surface moving into the mouth, or vice versa. Despite this debate, it is accepted that vertebrate teeth are homologous to the dermal denticles found on the skin of basal Gnathostomes (i.e. Chondrichtyans). Since the origin of teeth some 450 mya, the vertebrate dentition has diversified within the reptiles, amphibians, and fish: however most of these groups continue to possess a long row of pointed or sharp-sided, undifferentiated teeth (&quot;homodont&quot;) that are completely replaceable. The mammalian pattern is significantly different. The teeth in the upper and lower jaws in mammals have evolved a close-fitting relationship such that they operate together as a unit. &quot;They &#x27;occlude&#x27;, that is, the chewing surfaces of the teeth are so constructed that the upper and lower teeth are able to fit precisely together, cutting, crushing, grinding or tearing the food caught between.&quot;

Mammals have up to four distinct types of teeth, though not all types are present in all mammals. These are the incisor (&quot;cutting&quot;), the canine, the premolar, and the molar (&quot;grinding&quot;). The incisors occupy the front of the tooth row in both upper and lower jaws. They are normally flat, chisel-shaped teeth that meet in an edge-to-edge bite. Their function is cutting, slicing, or gnawing food into manageable pieces that fit into the mouth for further chewing. The canines are immediately behind the incisors. In many mammals, the canines are pointed, tusk-shaped teeth, projecting beyond the level of the other teeth. In carnivores, they are primarily offensive weapons for bringing down prey. In other mammals such as some primates, they are used to split open hard-surfaced food. In humans, the canine teeth are the main components in occlusal function and articulation. The mandibular teeth function against the maxillary teeth in a particular movement that is harmonious to the shape of the occluding surfaces. This creates the incising and grinding functions. The teeth must mesh together the way gears mesh in a transmission. If the interdigitation of the opposing cusps and incisal edges are not directed properly the teeth will wear abnormally (attrition), break away irregular crystalline enamel structures from the surface (abrasion), or fracture larger pieces (abfraction). This is a three-dimensional movement of the mandible in relation to the maxilla. There are three points of guidance: the two posterior points provided by the temporomandibular joints and the anterior component provided by the incisors and canines. The incisors mostly control the vertical opening of the chewing cycle when the muscles of mastication move the jaw forwards and backwards (protrusion/retrusion). The canines come into function guiding the vertical movement when the chewing is side to side (lateral). The canines alone can cause the other teeth to separate at the extreme end of the cycle (cuspid guided function) or all the posterior teeth can continue to stay in contact (group function). The entire range of this movement is the envelope of masticatory function. The initial movement inside this envelope is directed by the shape of the teeth in contact and the Glenoid Fossa/Condyle shape. The outer extremities of this envelope are limited by muscles, ligaments and the articular disc of the TMJ. Without the guidance of anterior incisors and canines, this envelope of function can be destructive to the remaining teeth resulting in periodontal trauma from occlusion seen as wear, fracture or tooth loosening and loss. The premolars and molars are at the back of the mouth. Depending on the particular mammal and its diet, these two kinds of teeth prepare pieces of food to be swallowed by grinding, shearing, or crushing. The specialised teeth—incisors, canines, premolars, and molars—are found in the same order in every mammal. In many mammals, the infants have a set of teeth that fall out and are replaced by adult teeth. These are called deciduous teeth, primary teeth, baby teeth or milk teeth. Animals that have two sets of teeth, one followed by the other, are said to be diphyodont. Normally the dental formula for milk teeth is the same as for adult teeth except that the molars are missing.

==Dental formula==
Because every mammal&#x27;s teeth are specialised for different functions, many mammal groups have lost the teeth that are not needed in their adaptation. Tooth form has also undergone evolutionary modification as a result of natural selection for specialised feeding or other adaptations. Over time, different mammal groups have evolved distinct dental features, both in the number and type of teeth and in the shape and size of the chewing surface.

The number of teeth of each type is written as a dental formula for one side of the mouth, or quadrant, with the upper and lower teeth shown on separate rows. The number of teeth in a mouth is twice that listed, as there are two sides. In each set, incisors (I) are indicated first, canines (C) second, premolars (P) third, and finally molars (M), giving I:C:P:M. So for example, the formula 2.1.2.3 for upper teeth indicates 2 incisors, 1 canine, 2 premolars, and 3 molars on one side of the upper mouth. The deciduous dental formula is notated in lowercase lettering preceded by the letter d: for example: di:dc:dp.

An animal&#x27;s dentition for either deciduous or permanent teeth can thus be expressed as a dental formula, written in the form of a fraction, which can be written as , or I.C.P.M / I.C.P.M. For example, the following formulae show the deciduous and usual permanent dentition of all catarrhine primates, including humans:

#Deciduous: formula_1 This can also be written as . Superscript and subscript denote upper and lower jaw, i.e. do not indicate mathematical operations; the numbers are the count of the teeth of each type. The dashes (-) in the formula are likewise not mathematical operators, but spacers, meaning &quot;to&quot;: for instance the human formula is meaning that people may have 2 or 3 molars on each side of each jaw. &#x27;d&#x27; denotes deciduous teeth (i.e. milk or baby teeth); lower case also indicates temporary teeth. Another annotation is , &quot;if&quot; the fact that it pertains to deciduous teeth is clearly stated, per examples found in some texts such as &quot;The Cambridge Dictionary of Human Biology and Evolution.&quot;
#Permanent: formula_2 This can also be written as . When the upper and lower dental formulae are the same, some texts write the formula without a fraction (in this case, 2.1.2.3), on the implicit assumption that the reader will realise it must apply to both upper and lower quadrants. This is seen, for example, throughout &quot;The Cambridge Dictionary of Human Biology and Evolution&quot;.

The greatest number of teeth in any known placental land mammal was 48, with a formula of . However, no living placental mammal has this number. In extant placental mammals, the maximum dental formula is for pigs. Mammalian tooth counts are usually identical in the upper and lower jaws, but not always. For example, the aye-aye has a formula of , demonstrating the need for both upper and lower quadrant counts.

===Tooth naming discrepancies===
Teeth are numbered starting at 1 in each group. Thus the human teeth are I1, I2, C1, P3, P4, M1, M2, and M3. (See next paragraph for premolar naming etymology.) In humans, the third molar is known as the wisdom tooth, whether or not it has erupted.

Regarding premolars, there is disagreement regarding whether the third type of deciduous tooth is a premolar (the general consensus among mammalogists) or a molar (commonly held among human anatomists). There is thus some discrepancy between nomenclature in zoology and in dentistry. This is because the terms of human dentistry, which have generally prevailed over time, have not included mammalian dental evolutionary theory. There were originally four premolars in each quadrant of early mammalian jaws. However, all living primates have lost at least the first premolar. &quot;Hence most of the prosimians and platyrrhines have three premolars. Some genera have also lost more than one. A second premolar has been lost in all catarrhines. The remaining permanent premolars are then properly identified as P2, P3 and P4 or P3 and P4; however, traditional dentistry refers to them as P1 and P2&quot;.

===Dental eruption sequence===
The order in which teeth emerge through the gums is known as the dental eruption sequence. Rapidly developing anthropoid primates such as macaques, chimpanzees, and australopithecines have an eruption sequence of M1 I1 I2 M2 P3 P4 C M3, whereas anatomically modern humans have the sequence M1 I1 I2 C P3 P4 M2 M3. The later that tooth emergence begins, the earlier the anterior teeth (I1–P4) appear in the sequence.

==Dentition use in archaeology==
Dentition, or the study of teeth, is an important area of study for archaeologists, especially those specializing in the study of older remains. Dentition affords many advantages over studying the rest of the skeleton itself (osteometry). The structure and arrangement of teeth is constant and, although it is inherited, does not undergo extensive change during environmental change, dietary specializations, or alterations in use patterns. The rest of the skeleton is much more likely to exhibit change because of adaptation. Teeth also preserve better than bone, and so the sample of teeth available to archaeologists is much more extensive and therefore more representative.

Dentition is particularly useful in tracking ancient populations&#x27; movements, because there are differences in the shapes of incisors, the number of grooves on molars, presence/absence of wisdom teeth, and extra cusps on particular teeth. These differences can not only be associated with different populations across space, but also change over time so that the study of the characteristics of teeth could say which population one is dealing with, and at what point in that population&#x27;s history they are.

==Dinosaurs==
A dinosaur&#x27;s dentition included all the teeth in its jawbones, which consist of the dentary, maxillary, and in some cases the premaxillary bones. The maxilla is the main bone of the upper jaw. The premaxilla is a smaller bone forming the anterior of the animal&#x27;s upper jaw. The dentary is the main bone that forms the lower jaw (mandible). The predentary is a smaller bone that forms the anterior end of the lower jaw in ornithischian dinosaurs; it is always edentulous and supported a horny beak.

Unlike modern lizards, dinosaur teeth grew individually in the sockets of the jawbones, which are known as the dental alveoli. This thecodont dentition is also present in crocodilians and mammals, but is not found among the non-archosaur reptiles, which instead have acrodont or pleurodont dentition. Teeth that were lost were replaced by teeth below the roots in each tooth socket. Occlusion refers to the closing of the dinosaur&#x27;s mouth, where the teeth from the upper and lower parts of the jaw meet. If the occlusion causes teeth from the maxillary or premaxillary bones to cover the teeth of the dentary and predentary, the dinosaur is said to have an overbite, the most common condition in this group. The opposite condition is considered to be an underbite, which is rare in theropod dinosaurs.

The majority of dinosaurs had teeth that were similarly shaped throughout their jaws but varied in size. Dinosaur tooth shapes included cylindrical, peg-like, teardrop-shaped, leaf-like, diamond-shaped and blade-like. A dinosaur that has a variety of tooth shapes is said to have heterodont dentition. An example of this are dinosaurs of the group Heterodontosauridae and the enigmatic early dinosaur, &quot;Eoraptor&quot;. While most dinosaurs had a single row of teeth on each side of their jaws, others had dental batteries where teeth in the cheek region were fused together to form compound teeth. Individually these teeth were not suitable for grinding food, but when joined together with other teeth they would form a large surface area for the mechanical digestion of tough plant materials. This type of dental strategy is observed in ornithopod and ceratopsian dinosaurs as well as the duck-billed hadrosaurs, which had more than one hundred teeth in each dental battery. The teeth of carnivorous dinosaurs, called ziphodont, were typically blade-like or cone-shaped, curved, with serrated edges. This dentition was adapted for grasping and cutting through flesh. In some cases, as observed in the railroad-spike-sized teeth of &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, the teeth were designed to puncture and crush bone. Some dinosaurs had procumbent teeth, which projected forward in the mouth.

<text>The Toonumbar National Park is a protected national park located in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Australia. The park is situated approximately north of Sydney, near the town of .

The park is part of the Focal Peak Group World Heritage Site Gondwana Rainforests of Australia inscribed in 1986 and added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2007.

==Description==
The park features subtropical rainforests protecting threatened plants and animals, such as the sooty owl, red-legged pademelon and yellow-bellied glider. The rainforests on Dome Mountain and the Murray Scrub are part of the World Heritage listed Gondwana Rainforests of Australia. The rugged landscape of Mount Lindesay, Dome Mountain and Edinburgh Castle have provided the inspiration for many local Aboriginal legends.

The Murray Scrub and the Dome Mountain Forest contain significant areas of subtropical and temperate rainforest and are listed as part of the World Heritage Gondwana Rainforests of Australia. There are also drier and cooler places in the park and this has resulted in incredible diversity of flora, from eucalypt woodlands and tall gum forests, to forests of bangalow palms.

Animals in the park include marbled frogmouth, koala, Albert lyrebird and rainforest reptiles and frogs. The rainforest area is an important refuge for a number of fruit-eating pigeons and insectivorous bats. Pademelons also live there.

Focal Peak Volcano situated in Mt Barney National Park was active 23 million years ago and was responsible for the eroded volcanic remains of Mount Lindesay, Dome Mountain and Edinburgh Castle that dominate the landscape today. The high rainfall combined with fertile soil have created lush rainforests.

On average, the park receives of rain each year. Its highest recorded rainfall was in one day.

==Native title claim==
Toonumbar National Park was part of the successful Githabul Nation native title claim. The Native title claimant Trevor Close an Aboriginal lawyer fought the NSW Government fifteen years probono to win the historic Native Title claim in memory of his grandfather Rory Close and his children Nea Close, Marnie Close Sera Close, Issiah Close and Tomika Close, Yartha Close and Kory Close. Trevor Close Githabul Tribal name is Mudargun which means lawman.

Inside Toonumbar National Park there are a number of jurabihls (increase sites) which were recorded with the assistance of the late Auntie Millie Boyd in 1974 by Howard Creamer. These types of sites (involving a complex set of religious and ritualistic beliefs) are of National significance due to their rarity in Australia and the rest of the world. Dome Mountain is the Githabul sacred site for the rain ceremony. Edinburgh Castle is the Goanna site and owned by the Clara Williams descendants who reside at the Aboriginal Reservation Muli Muli, which is 10 km (6 mi) west of the town of Woodenbong.

<text>Wallaga Lake National Park is a former national park in New South Wales, south-west of Sydney and north of Bermagui. It now forms part of a greater Gulaga National Park.

In 2001, as part of the Southern Comprehensive Regional Forest Agreement and at the request of Yuin people, Gulaga National Park was created out of the existing Wallaga Lake National Park, Goura Nature Reserve, and Mt Dromedary Flora Reserve.

In May 2006, ownership to this former National Park, plus the rest of the Gulaga National Park, was restored to the area&#x27;s traditional owners, in whom legal tenure was vested (in trust) as part of an agreement signed by then New South Wales Environment Minister Bob Debus and representatives for the Yuin people.

The name of the park derived from Wallaga Lake, which is of cultural significance as well as being a source of food for the Yuin people. The black duck, Umbarra, who lives here, is the totem of the Yuin-Monaro people.
