<text>A wetland is a distinct semi-aquatic ecosystem whose groundcovers are flooded or saturated in water, either permanently, for years or decades, or only seasonally. Flooding results in oxygen-poor (anoxic) processes taking place, especially in the soils. Wetlands form a transitional zone between waterbodies and dry lands, and are different from other terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems due to their vegetation&#x27;s roots having adapted to oxygen-poor waterlogged soils. They are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as habitats to a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals, with often improved water quality due to plant removal of excess nutrients such as nitrates and phosphorus.

Wetlands exist on every continent, except Antarctica. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish or saltwater. The main types of wetland are defined based on the dominant plants and the source of the water. For example, &quot;marshes&quot; are wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous vegetation such as reeds, cattails and sedges. &quot;Swamps&quot; are dominated by woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs (although reed swamps in Europe are dominated by reeds, not trees). Mangrove forest are wetlands with mangroves, halophytic woody plants that have evolved to tolerate salty water.

Examples of wetlands classified by the sources of water include &quot;tidal wetlands&quot;, where the water source is ocean tides; &quot;estuaries&quot;, water source is mixed tidal and river waters; &quot;floodplains&quot;, water source is excess water from overflowed rivers or lakes; and &quot;bogs&quot; and &quot;vernal ponds&quot;, water source is rainfall or meltwater. The world&#x27;s largest wetlands include the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, the Pantanal in South America, and the Sundarbans in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. 

Wetlands contribute many ecosystem services that benefit people. These include for example water purification, stabilization of shorelines, storm protection and flood control. In addition, wetlands also process and condense carbon (in processes called carbon fixation and sequestration), and other nutrients and water pollutants. Wetlands can act as a sink or a source of carbon, depending on the specific wetland. If they function as a carbon sink, they can help with climate change mitigation. However, wetlands can also be a significant source of methane emissions due to anaerobic decomposition of soaked detritus, and some are also emitters of nitrous oxide. 

Humans are disturbing and damaging wetlands in many ways, including oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution, and water pollution. Wetlands are more threatened by environmental degradation than any other ecosystem on Earth, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment from 2005. Methods exist for assessing wetland ecological health. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation by raising public awareness of the functions that wetlands can provide. Since 1971, work under an international treaty seeks to identify and protect &quot;wetlands of international importance.&quot; 

==Definitions and terminology==
===Technical definitions===
A simplified definition of wetland is &quot;an area of land that is usually saturated with water&quot;. More precisely, wetlands are areas where &quot;water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil all year or for varying periods of time during the year, including during the growing season&quot;. A patch of land that develops pools of water after a rain storm would not necessarily be considered a &quot;wetland&quot;, even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other water bodies or landforms based on their water level and on the types of plants that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a water table that stands at or near the land surface for a long enough period each year to support aquatic plants.

A more concise definition is a community composed of hydric soil and hydrophytes.

Wetlands have also been described as ecotones, providing a transition between dry land and water bodies. Wetlands exist &quot;...at the interface between truly terrestrial ecosystems and aquatic systems, making them inherently different from each other, yet highly dependent on both.&quot;

In environmental decision-making, there are subsets of definitions that are agreed upon to make regulatory and policy decisions.

Under the Ramsar international wetland conservation treaty, wetlands are defined as follows:
* Article 1.1: &quot;...wetlands are areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six meters.&quot;
* Article 2.1: &quot;[Wetlands] may incorporate riparian and coastal zones adjacent to the wetlands, and islands or bodies of marine water deeper than six meters at low tide lying within the wetlands.&quot;
An ecological definition of a wetland is &quot;an ecosystem that arises when inundation by water produces soils dominated by anaerobic and aerobic processes, which, in turn, forces the biota, particularly rooted plants, to adapt to flooding&quot;.

Sometimes a precise legal definition of a wetland is required. The definition used for regulation by the United States government is: &#x27;The term &quot;wetlands&quot; means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally included swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.&#x27;

For each of these definitions and others, regardless of the purpose, hydrology is emphasized (shallow waters, water-logged soils). The soil characteristics and the plants and animals controlled by the wetland hydrology are often additional components of the definitions.

=== Types ===
Wetlands can be tidal (inundated by tides) or non-tidal. The water in wetlands is either freshwater, brackish, saline, or alkaline. There are four main kinds of wetlands – marsh, swamp, bog, and fen (bogs and fens being types of peatlands or mires). Some experts also recognize wet meadows and aquatic ecosystems as additional wetland types. Sub-types include mangrove forests, carrs, pocosins, floodplains, peatlands, vernal pools, sinks, and many others.

The following three groups are used within Australia to classify wetland by type: Marine and coastal zone wetlands, inland wetlands and human-made wetlands. In the US, the best known classifications are the Cowardin classification system and the hydrogeomorphic (HGM) classification system. The Cowardin system includes five main types of wetlands: marine (ocean-associated), estuarine (mixed ocean- and river-associated), riverine (within river channels), lacustrine (lake-associated) and palustrine (inland nontidal habitats).

==== Peatlands ====
Peatlands are a unique kind of wetland where lush plant growth and slow decay of dead plants (under anoxic conditions) results in organic peat accumulating; bogs, fens, and mires are different names for peatlands.

=== Wetland names ===
Variations of names for wetland systems:
* Bayou
* Flooded grasslands and savannas
* Marsh
** Brackish marsh
** Freshwater marsh
* Mire
** Fen
** Bog
* Riparian zone
* Swamp
** Freshwater swamp forest
**Tidal Freshwater forest
** Coniferous swamp
** Peat swamp forest
** Mangrove swamp
* Vernal pool
Some wetlands have localized names unique to a region such as the prairie potholes of North America&#x27;s northern plain, pocosins, Carolina bays and baygalls of the Southeastern US, mallines of Argentina, Mediterranean seasonal ponds of Europe and California, turloughs of Ireland, billabongs of Australia, among many others.

=== Locations ===

==== By temperature zone ====

Wetlands are found throughout the world in different climates. Temperatures vary greatly depending on the location of the wetland. Many of the world&#x27;s wetlands are in the temperate zones, midway between the North or South Poles and the equator. In these zones, summers are warm and winters are cold, but temperatures are not extreme. In subtropical zone wetlands, such as along the Gulf of Mexico, average temperatures might be . Wetlands in the tropics are subjected to much higher temperatures for a large portion of the year. Temperatures for wetlands on the Arabian Peninsula can exceed and these habitats would therefore be subject to rapid evaporation. In northeastern Siberia, which has a polar climate, wetland temperatures can be as low as . Peatlands in arctic and subarctic regions insulate the permafrost, thus delaying or preventing its thawing during summer, as well as inducing its formation.

==== By precipitation amount ====
The amount of precipitation a wetland receives varies widely according to its area. Wetlands in Wales, Scotland, and western Ireland typically receive about per year. In some places in Southeast Asia, where heavy rains occur, they can receive up to . In some drier regions, wetlands exist where as little as precipitation occurs each year.

Temporal variation:
* Perennial systems
* Seasonal systems
* Episodic (periodic or intermittent) systems
* Ephemeral (short-lived) systems
Surface flow may occur in some segments, with subsurface flow in other segments.

==Processes==
Wetlands vary widely due to local and regional differences in topography, hydrology, vegetation, and other factors, including human involvement. Other important factors include fertility, natural disturbance, competition, herbivory, burial and salinity. When peat accumulates, bogs and fens arise.

===Hydrology===
The most important factor producing wetlands is hydrology, or flooding. The duration of flooding or prolonged soil saturation by groundwater determines whether the resulting wetland has aquatic, marsh or swamp vegetation. Other important factors include soil fertility, natural disturbance, competition, herbivory, burial, and salinity. When peat from dead plants accumulates, bogs and fens develop.

Wetland hydrology is associated with the spatial and temporal dispersion, flow, and physio-chemical attributes of surface and ground waters. Sources of hydrological flows into wetlands are predominantly precipitation, surface water (saltwater or freshwater), and groundwater. Water flows out of wetlands by evapotranspiration, surface flows and tides, and subsurface water outflow. Hydrodynamics (the movement of water through and from a wetland) affects hydro-periods (temporal fluctuations in water levels) by controlling the water balance and water storage within a wetland.

Landscape characteristics control wetland hydrology and water chemistry. The O2 and CO2 concentrations of water depend upon temperature, atmospheric pressure and mixing with the air (from winds or water flows). Water chemistry within wetlands is determined by the pH, salinity, nutrients, conductivity, soil composition, hardness, and the sources of water. Water chemistry varies across landscapes and climatic regions. Wetlands are generally minerotrophic (waters contain dissolved materials from soils) with the exception of ombrotrophic bogs that are fed only by water from precipitation.

Because bogs receive most of their water from precipitation and humidity from the atmosphere, their water usually has low mineral ionic composition. In contrast, wetlands fed by groundwater or tides have a higher concentration of dissolved nutrients and minerals.

Fen peatlands receive water both from precipitation and ground water in varying amounts so their water chemistry ranges from acidic with low levels of dissolved minerals to alkaline with high accumulation of calcium and magnesium.

===Role of salinity===

Salinity has a strong influence on wetland water chemistry, particularly in coastal wetlands and in arid and semiarid regions with large precipitation deficits. Natural salinity is regulated by interactions between ground and surface water, which may be influenced by human activity.

===Soil===
Carbon is the major nutrient cycled within wetlands. Most nutrients, such as sulfur, phosphorus, carbon, and nitrogen are found within the soil of wetlands. Anaerobic and aerobic respiration in the soil influences the nutrient cycling of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and the solubility of phosphorus thus contributing to the chemical variations in its water. Wetlands with low pH and saline conductivity may reflect the presence of acid sulfates and wetlands with average salinity levels can be heavily influenced by calcium or magnesium. Biogeochemical processes in wetlands are determined by soils with low redox potential.

== Biology ==
The life forms of a wetland system includes its plants (flora) and animals (fauna) and microbes (bacteria, fungi). The most important factor is the wetland&#x27;s duration of flooding. Other important factors include fertility and salinity of the water or soils. The chemistry of water flowing into wetlands depends on the source of water, the geological material that it flows through and the nutrients discharged from organic matter in the soils and plants at higher elevations. Plants and animals may vary within a wetland seasonally or in response to flood regimes.
=== Flora ===
There are four main groups of hydrophytes that are found in wetland systems throughout the world.

Submerged wetland vegetation can grow in saline and fresh-water conditions. Some species have underwater flowers, while others have long stems to allow the flowers to reach the surface. Submerged species provide a food source for native fauna, habitat for invertebrates, and also possess filtration capabilities. Examples include seagrasses and eelgrass.

Floating water plants or floating vegetation are usually small, like those in the Lemnoideae subfamily (duckweeds).
Emergent vegetation like the cattails (&quot;Typha&quot; spp.), sedges (&quot;Carex&quot; spp.) and arrow arum (&quot;Peltandra virginica&quot;) rise above the surface of the water.

When trees and shrubs comprise much of the plant cover in saturated soils, those areas in most cases are called swamps. The upland boundary of swamps is determined partly by water levels. This can be affected by dams Some swamps can be dominated by a single species, such as silver maple swamps around the Great Lakes. Others, like those of the Amazon basin, have large numbers of different tree species. Other examples include cypress (&quot;Taxodium&quot;) and mangrove swamps.

=== Fauna ===
Many species of fish are highly dependent on wetland ecosystems. Seventy-five percent of the United States&#x27; commercial fish and shellfish stocks depend solely on estuaries to survive.

Amphibians such as frogs and salamanders need both terrestrial and aquatic habitats in which to reproduce and feed. Because amphibians often inhabit depressional wetlands like prairie potholes and Carolina bays, the connectivity among these isolated wetlands is an important control of regional populations. While tadpoles feed on algae, adult frogs forage on insects. Frogs are sometimes used as an indicator of ecosystem health because their thin skin permits absorption of nutrients and toxins from the surrounding environment resulting in increased extinction rates in unfavorable and polluted environmental conditions.

Reptiles such as snakes, lizards, turtles, alligators and crocodiles are common in wetlands of some regions. In freshwater wetlands of the Southeastern US, alligators are common and a freshwater species of crocodile occurs in South Florida. The Florida Everglades is the only place in the world where both crocodiles and alligators coexist. The saltwater crocodile inhabits estuaries and mangroves. Snapping turtles also inhabit wetlands.

Birds, particularly waterfowl and waders use wetlands extensively.

Mammals of wetlands include numerous small and medium-sized species such as voles, bats, muskrats and platypus in addition to large herbivorous and apex predator species such as the beavers, coypu, swamp rabbit, Florida panther, jaguar, and moose. Wetlands attract many mammals due to abundant seeds, berries, and other vegetation as food for herbivores, as well as abundant populations of invertebrates, small reptiles and amphibians as prey for predators.

Invertebrates of wetlands include aquatic insects such as dragonflies, aquatic bugs and beetles, midges, mosquitos, crustaceans such as crabs, crayfish, shrimps, microcrustaceans, mollusks like clams, mussels, snails and worms. Invertebrates comprise more than half of the known animal species in wetlands, and are considered the primary food web link between plants and higher animals (such as fish and birds).

== Ecosystem services ==
Depending on a wetland&#x27;s geographic and topographic location, the functions it performs can support multiple ecosystem services, values, or benefits. United Nations Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and Ramsar Convention described wetlands as a whole to be of biosphere significance and societal importance in the following areas:
* Water storage (flood control)
* Groundwater replenishment
* Shoreline stabilization and storm protection
* Water purification
* Wastewater treatment (in constructed wetlands)
* Reservoirs of biodiversity
* Pollination
* Wetland products
* Cultural values
* Recreation and tourism
* Climate change mitigation and adaptation

According to the Ramsar Convention:

The economic worth of the ecosystem services provided to society by intact, naturally functioning wetlands is frequently much greater than the perceived benefits of converting them to &#x27;more valuable&#x27; intensive land use – particularly as the profits from unsustainable use often go to relatively few individuals or corporations, rather than being shared by society as a whole.

To replace these wetland ecosystem services, enormous amounts of money would need to be spent on water purification plants, dams, levees, and other hard infrastructure, and many of the services are impossible to replace.

=== Storage reservoirs and flood protection ===

Floodplains and closed-depression wetlands can provide the functions of storage reservoirs and flood protection. The wetland system of floodplains is formed from major rivers downstream from their headwaters. &quot;The floodplains of major rivers act as natural storage reservoirs, enabling excess water to spread out over a wide area, which reduces its depth and speed. Wetlands close to the headwaters of streams and rivers can slow down rainwater runoff and spring snowmelt so that it does not run straight off the land into water courses. This can help prevent sudden, damaging floods downstream.&quot; 

Notable river systems that produce wide floodplains include the Nile River, the Niger river inland delta, the Zambezi River flood plain, the Okavango River inland delta, the Kafue River flood plain, the Lake Bangweulu flood plain (Africa), Mississippi River (US), Amazon River (South America), Yangtze River (China), Danube River (Central Europe) and Murray-Darling River (Australia).

===Groundwater replenishment===
Groundwater replenishment can be achieved for example by marsh, swamp, and subterranean karst and cave hydrological systems. The surface water visibly seen in wetlands only represents a portion of the overall water cycle, which also includes atmospheric water (precipitation) and groundwater. Many wetlands are directly linked to groundwater and they can be a crucial regulator of both the quantity and quality of water found below the ground. Wetlands that have permeable substrates like limestone or occur in areas with highly variable and fluctuating water tables have especially important roles in groundwater replenishment or water recharge. 

Substrates that are porous allow water to filter down through the soil and underlying rock into aquifers which are the source of much of the world&#x27;s drinking water. Wetlands can also act as recharge areas when the surrounding water table is low and as a discharge zone when it is high. 

===Shoreline stabilization and storm protection===

Mangroves, coral reefs, salt marsh can help with shoreline stabilization and storm protection. Tidal and inter-tidal wetland systems protect and stabilize coastal zones. Coral reefs provide a protective barrier to coastal shoreline. Mangroves stabilize the coastal zone from the interior and will migrate with the shoreline to remain adjacent to the boundary of the water. The main conservation benefit these systems have against storms and storm surges is the ability to reduce the speed and height of waves and floodwaters.

The United Kingdom has begun the concept of managed coastal realignment. This management technique provides shoreline protection through restoration of natural wetlands rather than through applied engineering. In East Asia, reclamation of coastal wetlands has resulted in widespread transformation of the coastal zone, and up to 65% of coastal wetlands have been destroyed by coastal development. One analysis using the impact of hurricanes versus storm protection provided naturally by wetlands projected the value of this service at US$33,000/hectare/year.

===Water purification===
Water purification can be provided by floodplains, closed-depression wetlands, mudflat, freshwater marsh, salt marsh, mangroves. Wetlands cycle both sediments and nutrients, sometimes serving as buffers between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. A natural function of wetland vegetation is the up-take, storage, and (for nitrate) the removal of nutrients found in runoff water from the surrounding landscapes. 

Precipitation and surface runoff induces soil erosion, transporting sediment in suspension into and through waterways. All types of sediments whether composed of clay, silt, sand or gravel and rock can be carried into wetland systems through erosion. Wetland vegetation acts as a physical barrier to slow water flow and then trap sediment for both short or long periods of time. Suspended sediment can contain heavy metals that are also retained when wetlands trap the sediment. 

The ability of wetland systems to store or remove nutrients and trap sediment is highly efficient and effective but each system has a threshold. An overabundance of nutrient input from fertilizer run-off, sewage effluent, or non-point pollution will cause eutrophication. Upstream erosion from deforestation can overwhelm wetlands making them shrink in size and cause dramatic biodiversity loss through excessive sedimentation load. 

===Wastewater treatment===
Constructed wetlands are built for wastewater treatment. An example of how a natural wetland is used to provide some degree of sewage treatment is the East Kolkata Wetlands in Kolkata, India. The wetlands cover , and are used to treat Kolkata&#x27;s sewage. The nutrients contained in the wastewater sustain fish farms and agriculture.
===Reservoirs of biodiversity===
Wetland systems&#x27; rich biodiversity has become a focal point catalysed by the Ramsar Convention and World Wildlife Fund. The impact of maintaining biodiversity is seen at the local level through job creation, sustainability, and community productivity. A good example is the Lower Mekong basin which runs through Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, supporting over 55 million people.

A key fish species which is overfished, the Piramutaba catfish, &quot;Brachyplatystoma vaillantii&quot;, migrates more than from its nursery grounds near the mouth of the Amazon River to its spawning grounds in Andean tributaries, above sea level, distributing plant seeds along the route.

Intertidal mudflats have a level of productivity similar to that of some wetlands even while possessing a low number of species. The abundant invertebrates found within the mud are a food source for migratory waterfowl.

Mudflats, saltmarshes, mangroves, and seagrass beds have high levels of both species richness and productivity, and are home to important nursery areas for many commercial fish stocks.

Populations of many species are confined geographically to only one or a few wetland systems, often due to the long period of time that the wetlands have been physically isolated from other aquatic sources. For example, the number of endemic species in the Selenga River Delta of Lake Baikal in Russia classifies it as a hotspot for biodiversity and one of the most biodiverse wetlands in the entire world.

===Wetland products===
Wetlands naturally produce an array of vegetation and other ecological products that can be harvested for personal and commercial use. Many fishes have all or part of their life-cycle occurring within a wetland system. Fresh and saltwater fish are the main source of protein for about one billion people and comprise 15% of an additional 3.5 billion people&#x27;s protein intake. Another food staple found in wetland systems is rice, a popular grain that is consumed at the rate of one fifth of the total global calorie count. In Bangladesh, Cambodia and Vietnam, where rice paddies are predominant on the landscape, rice consumption reach 70%. Some native wetland plants in the Caribbean and Australia are harvested sustainably for medicinal compounds; these include the red mangrove (&quot;Rhizophora mangle&quot;) which possesses antibacterial, wound-healing, anti-ulcer effects, and antioxidant properties.

Other mangrove-derived products include fuelwood, salt (produced by evaporating seawater), animal fodder, traditional medicines (e.g. from mangrove bark), fibers for textiles and dyes and tannins.

=== Additional services and uses of wetlands ===
Some types of wetlands can serve as fire breaks that help slow the spread of minor wildfires. Larger wetland systems can influence local precipitation patterns. Some boreal wetland systems in catchment headwaters may help extend the period of flow and maintain water temperature in connected downstream waters. Pollination services are supported by many wetlands which may provide the only suitable habitat for pollinating insects, birds, and mammals in highly developed areas.

== Disturbances and human impacts ==
Wetlands, the functions and services they provide as well as their flora and fauna, can be affected by several types of disturbances. The disturbances (sometimes termed stressors or alterations) can be human-associated or natural, direct or indirect, reversible or not, and isolated or cumulative.

Disturbances include exogenous factors such as flooding or drought. Humans are disturbing and damaging wetlands for example by oil and gas extraction, building infrastructure, overgrazing of livestock, overfishing, alteration of wetlands including dredging and draining, nutrient pollution and water pollution. Disturbance puts different levels of stress on an environment depending on the type and duration of disturbance. 

Predominant disturbances of wetlands include:
* Enrichment/eutrophication
* Organic loading and reduced dissolved oxygen
* Contaminant toxicity
* Acidification
* Salinization
* Sedimentation
* Altered solar input (turbidity/shade)
* Vegetation removal
* Thermal alteration
* Drying/aridification
* Inundation/flooding
* Habitat fragmentation
* Other human impacts
Disturbances can be further categorized as follows:
* Minor disturbance: Stress that maintains ecosystem integrity.
* Moderate disturbance: Ecosystem integrity is damaged but can recover in time without assistance.
* Impairment or severe disturbance: Human intervention may be needed in order for ecosystem to recover.
Nutrient pollution comes from nitrogen inputs to aquatic systems and have drastically effected the dissolved nitrogen content of wetlands, introducing higher nutrient availability which leads to eutrophication.

Biodiversity loss occurs in wetland systems through land use changes, habitat destruction, pollution, exploitation of resources, and invasive species. For example, the introduction of water hyacinth, a native plant of South America into Lake Victoria in East Africa as well as duckweed into non-native areas of Queensland, Australia, have overtaken entire wetland systems overwhelming the habitats and reducing the diversity of native plants and animals. 

=== Conversion to dry land ===
To increase economic productivity, wetlands are often converted into dry land with dykes and drains and used for agricultural purposes. The construction of dykes, and dams, has negative consequences for individual wetlands and entire watersheds. Their proximity to lakes and rivers means that they are often developed for human settlement. Once settlements are constructed and protected by dykes, the settlements then become vulnerable to land subsidence and ever increasing risk of flooding. The Mississippi River Delta around New Orleans, Louisiana is a well-known example; the Danube Delta in Europe is another.

=== Drainage of floodplains ===
Drainage of floodplains or development activities that narrow floodplain corridors (such as the construction of levees) reduces the ability of coupled river-floodplain systems to control flood damage. That is because modified and less expansive systems must still manage the same amount of precipitation, causing flood peaks to be higher or deeper and floodwaters to travel faster.

Water management engineering developments in the past century have degraded floodplain wetlands through the construction of artificial embankments such as dykes, bunds, levees, weirs, barrages and dams. All concentrate water into a main channel and waters that historically spread slowly over a large, shallow area are concentrated. Loss of wetland floodplains results in more severe and damaging flooding. Catastrophic human impact in the Mississippi River floodplains was seen in death of several hundred individuals during a levee breach in New Orleans caused by Hurricane Katrina. Human-made embankments along the Yangtze River floodplains have caused the main channel of the river to become prone to more frequent and damaging flooding. Some of these events include the loss of riparian vegetation, a 30% loss of the vegetation cover throughout the river&#x27;s basin, a doubling of the percentage of the land affected by soil erosion, and a reduction in reservoir capacity through siltation build-up in floodplain lakes.

=== Overfishing ===
Overfishing is a major problem for sustainable use of wetlands. Concerns are developing over certain aspects of farm fishing, which uses natural wetlands and waterways to harvest fish for human consumption. Aquaculture is continuing to develop rapidly throughout the Asia-Pacific region especially in China where 90% of the total number of aquaculture farms occur, contributing 80% of global value. Some aquaculture has eliminated massive areas of wetland through practices such as the shrimp farming industry&#x27;s destruction of mangroves. Even though the damaging impact of large-scale shrimp farming on the coastal ecosystem in many Asian countries has been widely recognized for quite some time now, it has proved difficult to mitigate since other employment avenues for people are lacking. Also burgeoning demand for shrimp globally has provided a large and ready market.

== Conservation ==

Wetlands have historically subjected to large draining efforts for development (real estate or agriculture), and flooding to create recreational lakes or generate hydropower. Some of the world&#x27;s most important agricultural areas were wetlands that have been converted to farmland. Since the 1970s, more focus has been put on preserving wetlands for their natural functions. Since 1900, 65–70% of the world&#x27;s wetlands have been lost. In order to maintain wetlands and sustain their functions, alterations and disturbances that are outside the normal range of variation should be minimized.

===Balancing wetland conservation with the needs of people===
Wetlands are vital ecosystems that enhance the livelihoods for the millions of people who live in and around them. Studies have shown that it is possible to conserve wetlands while improving the livelihoods of people living among them. Case studies conducted in Malawi and Zambia looked at how dambos – wet, grassy valleys or depressions where water seeps to the surface – can be farmed sustainably. Project outcomes included a high yield of crops, development of sustainable farming techniques, and water management strategies that generate enough water for irrigation.

===Ramsar Convention===
The Ramsar Convention (full title: &quot;Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, especially as Waterfowl Habitat&quot;), is an international treaty designed to address global concerns regarding wetland loss and degradation. The primary purposes of the treaty are to list wetlands of international importance and to promote their wise use, with the ultimate goal of preserving the world&#x27;s wetlands. Methods include restricting access to some wetland areas, as well as educating the public to combat the misconception that wetlands are wastelands. The Convention works closely with five International Organisation Partners (IOPs). These are: Birdlife International, the IUCN, the International Water Management Institute, Wetlands International and the World Wide Fund for Nature. The partners provide technical expertise, help conduct or facilitate field studies and provide financial support. 

==Restoration==
Restoration and restoration ecologists intend to return wetlands to their natural trajectory by aiding directly with the natural processes of the ecosystem. These direct methods vary with respect to the degree of physical manipulation of the natural environment and each are associated with different levels of restoration. Restoration is needed after disturbance or perturbation of a wetland. There is no one way to restore a wetland and the level of restoration required will be based on the level of disturbance although, each method of restoration does require preparation and administration.

===Levels of restoration===
Factors influencing selected approach may include budget, time scale limitations, project goals, level of disturbance, landscape and ecological constraints, political and administrative agendas and socioeconomic priorities.

==== Prescribed natural or assisted regeneration ====
For this strategy, there is no biophysical manipulation and the ecosystem is left to recover based on the process of succession alone. The focus is to eliminate and prevent further disturbance from occurring and for this type of restoration requires prior research to understand the probability that the wetland will recover naturally. This is likely to be the first method of approach since it is the least intrusive and least expensive although some biophysical non-intrusive manipulation may be required to enhance the rate of succession to an acceptable level. Example methods include prescribed burns to small areas, promotion of site specific soil microbiota and plant growth using nucleation planting whereby plants radiate from an initial planting site, and promotion of niche diversity or increasing the range of niches to promote use by a variety of different species. These methods can make it easier for the natural species to flourish by removing environmental impediments and can speed up the process of succession.

==== Partial reconstruction ====
For this strategy, a mixture of natural regeneration and manipulated environmental control is used. This may require some engineering, and more intensive biophysical manipulations including ripping of subsoil, agrichemical applications of herbicides or insecticides, laying of mulch, mechanical seed dispersal, and tree planting on a large scale. In these circumstances the wetland is impaired and without human assistance it would not recover within an acceptable period of time as determined by ecologists. Methods of restoration used will have to be determined on a site by site basis as each location will require a different approach based on levels of disturbance and the local ecosystem dynamics.

==== Complete reconstruction ====

This most expensive and intrusive method of reconstruction requires engineering and ground up reconstruction. Because there is a redesign of the entire ecosystem it is important that the natural trajectory of the ecosystem be considered and that the plant species promoted will eventually return the ecosystem towards its natural trajectory.

In many cases constructed wetlands are often designed to treat stormwater/wastewater runoff. They can be used in developments as part of water-sensitive urban design systems and have benefits such as flood mitigation, removing pollutants, carbon sequestration, providing habitat for wildlife and biodiversity in often highly urbanised and fragmented landscapes.

====Traditional knowledge====
The ideas from traditional ecological knowledge can be applied as a holistic approach to the restoration of wetlands. These ideas focus more on responding to the observations detected from the environment considering that each part of a wetland ecosystem is interconnected. Applying these practices on specific locations of wetlands increase productivity, biodiversity, and improve its resilience. These practices include monitoring wetland resources, planting propagules, and addition of key species in order to create a self-sustaining wetland ecosystem. 

== Climate change aspects ==

=== Greenhouse gas emissions ===
In Southeast Asia, peat swamp forests and soils are being drained, burnt, mined, and overgrazed, contributing to climate change. As a result of peat drainage, the organic carbon that had built up over thousands of years and is normally under water is suddenly exposed to the air. The peat decomposes and is converted into carbon dioxide (CO2), which is then released into the atmosphere. Peat fires cause the same process to occur rapidly and in addition create enormous clouds of smoke that cross international borders, which now happens almost yearly in Southeast Asia. While peatlands constitute only 3% of the world&#x27;s land area, their degradation produces 7% of all CO2 emissions.

===Climate change mitigation===
Studies have favorably identified the potential for coastal wetlands (also called blue carbon ecosystems) to provide some degree of climate change mitigation in two ways: by conservation, reducing the greenhouse gas emissions arising from the loss and degradation of such habitats, and by restoration, to increase carbon dioxide drawdown and its long-term storage. However, CO2 removal using coastal blue carbon restoration has questionable cost-effectiveness when considered only as a climate mitigation action, either for carbon-offsetting or for inclusion in Nationally Determined Contributions.

When wetlands are restored they have mitigation effects through their ability to sink carbon, converting a greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide) to solid plant material through the process of photosynthesis, and also through their ability to store and regulate water.

Wetlands store approximately 44.6 million tonnes of carbon per year globally (estimate from 2003). In salt marshes and mangrove swamps in particular, the average carbon sequestration rate is while peatlands sequester approximately .

Coastal wetlands, such as tropical mangroves and some temperate salt marshes, are known to be sinks for carbon that otherwise contribute to climate change in its gaseous forms (carbon dioxide and methane). The ability of many tidal wetlands to store carbon and minimize methane flux from tidal sediments has led to sponsorship of blue carbon initiatives that are intended to enhance those processes.

=== Climate change adaptation ===
The restoration of coastal blue carbon ecosystems is highly advantageous for climate change adaptation, coastal protection, food provision and biodiversity conservation.

Since the middle of the 20th century, human-caused climate change has resulted in observable changes in the global water cycle. A warming climate makes extremely wet and very dry occurrences more severe, causing more severe floods and droughts. For this reason, some of the ecosystem services that wetlands provide (e.g. water storage and flood control, groundwater replenishment, shoreline stabilization and storm protection) are important for climate change adaptation measures. In most parts of the world and under all emission scenarios, water cycle variability and accompanying extremes are anticipated to rise more quickly than the changes of average values.

== Valuation ==
The value of a wetland to local communities typically involves first mapping a region&#x27;s wetlands, then assessing the functions and ecosystem services the wetlands provide individually and cumulatively, and finally evaluating that information to prioritize or rank individual wetlands or wetland types for conservation, management, restoration, or development. Over the longer term, it requires keeping inventories of known wetlands and monitoring a representative sample of the wetlands to determine changes due to both natural and human factors.

===Assessment===

Rapid assessment methods are used to score, rank, rate, or categorize various functions, ecosystem services, species, communities, levels of disturbance, and/or ecological health of a wetland or group of wetlands. This is often done to prioritize particular wetlands for conservation (avoidance) or to determine the degree to which loss or alteration of wetland functions should be compensated, such as by restoring degraded wetlands elsewhere or providing additional protections to existing wetlands. Rapid assessment methods are also applied before and after a wetland has been restored or altered to help monitor or predict the effects of those actions on various wetland functions and the services they provide. Assessments are typically considered to be &quot;rapid&quot; when they require only a single visit to the wetland lasting less than one day, which in some cases may include interpretation of aerial imagery and geographic information system (GIS) analyses of existing spatial data, but not detailed post-visit laboratory analyses of water or biological samples.

To achieve consistency among persons doing the assessment, rapid methods present indicator variables as questions or checklists on standardized data forms, and most methods standardize the scoring or rating procedure that is used to combine question responses into estimates of the levels of specified functions relative to the levels estimated in other wetlands (&quot;calibration sites&quot;) assessed previously in a region. Rapid assessment methods, partly because they often use dozens of indicators of conditions surrounding a wetland as well as within the wetland itself, aim to provide estimates of wetland functions and services that are more accurate and repeatable than simply describing a wetland&#x27;s class type. A need for wetland assessments to be rapid arises mainly when government agencies set deadlines for decisions affecting a wetland or when the number of wetlands needing information on their functions or condition is large.

===Inventory===

Although developing a global inventory of wetlands has proven to be a large and difficult undertaking, many efforts at more local scales have been successful. Current efforts are based on available data, but both classification and spatial resolution have sometimes proven to be inadequate for regional or site-specific environmental management decision making. Identifying small, long, and narrow wetlands within the landscape is difficult. Many of today&#x27;s remote sensing satellites do not have sufficient spatial and spectral resolution to monitor wetland conditions, although multispectral IKONOS and QuickBird data may offer improved spatial resolutions once it is 4 m or higher. Most of the pixels are just mixtures of several plant species or vegetation types. They are difficult to isolate, translating into an inability to classify the vegetation that defines the wetland. The growing availability of 3D vegetation and topography data from LiDAR has partially addressed the limitation of traditional multispectral imagery, as demonstrated in some case studies worldwide.

===Monitoring and mapping===

A wetland needs to be monitored over time to assess whether it is functioning at an ecologically sustainable level or whether it is becoming degraded. Degraded wetlands will suffer a loss in water quality, loss of sensitive species, and aberrant functioning of soil geochemical processes.

Practically, many natural wetlands are difficult to monitor from the ground as they quite often are difficult to access and may require exposure to dangerous plants and animals as well as diseases borne by insects or other invertebrates. Remote sensing such as aerial imagery and satellite imaging provides effective tools to map and monitor wetlands across large geographic regions and over time. Many remote sensing methods can be used to map wetlands. The integration of multi-sourced data such as LiDAR and aerial photos proves more effective at mapping wetlands than the use of aerial photos alone, especially with the aid of modern machine learning methods (e.g., deep learning). Overall, using digital data provides a standardized data-collection procedure and an opportunity for data integration within a geographic information system.

====United States====
Each country and region tends to have a codified definition of wetlands for legal purposes. In the United States, wetlands are defined as &quot;those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas&quot;. This definition has been used in the enforcement of the Clean Water Act. Some US states, such as Massachusetts and New York, have separate definitions that may differ from the federal government&#x27;s.

In the United States Code, the term wetland is defined &quot;as land that (A) has a predominance of hydric soils, (B) is inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions and (C) under normal circumstances supports a prevalence of such vegetation.&quot; Related to these legal definitions, &quot;normal circumstances&quot; are expected to occur during the wet portion of the growing season under normal climatic conditions (not unusually dry or unusually wet) and in the absence of significant disturbance. It is not uncommon for a wetland to be dry for long portions of the growing season. Still, under normal environmental conditions, the soils will be inundated to the surface, creating anaerobic conditions persisting through the wet portion of the growing season.

<text>That Thing You Do! is a 1996 American musical comedy-drama film written and directed by Tom Hanks, in his feature writing and directorial debut. Set in 1960s rock and roll culture, it chronicles the rise and fall of a fictional one-hit wonder pop band and stars Tom Everett Scott in his film debut along with Johnathon Schaech, Steve Zahn, and Ethan Embry as the band&#x27;s members, with Liv Tyler and Hanks appearing in supporting roles. Its production and music are key to its narrative, with original scores by a collaboration of artists including Hanks, Adam Schlesinger, and Howard Shore. The soundtrack peaked at #21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, featuring a mix of diegetic and non-diegetic tracks. The cast practiced for weeks to perform convincingly on camera, blurring the lines between reality and fiction.

Despite being well-received by critics, receiving several accolades, and producing a musical hit with the titular song of the same title, which was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, the film was a commercial disappointment, grossing $34.6 million against a $26 million budget.

That Thing You Do! is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of America. 

==Plot==
In 1964, aspiring jazz drummer Guy Patterson is working in his family&#x27;s appliance store in Erie, Pennsylvania, when his friends Jimmy Mattingly II and Lenny Haise ask him to perform a song Jimmy wrote at a talent show with their band. They rehearse the song, a slow-tempo ballad called &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot;, in Jimmy&#x27;s garage, and Jimmy&#x27;s girlfriend Faye Dolan proposes &quot;The Oneders&quot;, a play on the Beatles, as the band&#x27;s name. At the talent show, the group performs the song at a faster tempo and wins the competition, earning a paying gig at Villapiano&#x27;s, a local pizza parlor. After they decide to record the song and sell 45s of it, produced by Guy&#x27;s Uncle Bob, local talent promoter Phil Horace notices the band, promising them radio airplay within 10 days. Lenny convinces the band to sign with him.

Phil arranges for the song to debut on Pennsylvania radio, and eventually books them for a showcase concert in Pittsburgh, where technical difficulties and the band&#x27;s lack of stagecraft result in a disastrous performance. Afterward, Phil introduces a dispirited Guy to Mr. Amos White, an A&amp;R representative for Play-Tone Records, who offers the band a contract and becomes their manager. He renames the band &quot;the Wonders&quot; (as many people had misinterpreted &quot;Oneders&quot; as &quot;O&#x27;Neders&quot;, pronounced &quot;Oh-nee-ders&quot;), advises them on style and presentation (including matching suits, with Guy sporting sunglasses as his trademark), and places them on the Play-Tone tour of Midwestern state fairs, with Faye handling their wardrobes.

During the tour, the Wonders meet other acts, learn about the business, and improve their performing skills. Jimmy flirts with singer Diane Dane, while the bass player falls for a member of female R&amp;B trio the Chantrellines. &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot; garners national radio airplay, raising the band&#x27;s popularity and eventually reaching number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; Mr. White then sends them to Los Angeles for publicity, including radio and film appearances. On the day of their appearance on The Hollywood Television Showcase, a nationally televised live variety show, Mr. White replaces the absent T.B., who has joined the Marine Corps, with experienced session bassist Scott Pell. Guy is hungover after meeting his idol, jazz pianist Del Paxton, while Jimmy is nervously vomiting and Lenny is preoccupied with his new girlfriend; still, the Wonders manage to successfully cooperate. When television captions display the individual members, Jimmy is visibly angered by the caption announcing his engagement.

After the performance, Jimmy criticizes Faye in the dressing room, insinuating that she disclosed the engagement (although White implies that it was him). Faye, already disillusioned with Jimmy&#x27;s increasing preoccupation with the band, breaks up with him. Lenny, meanwhile, elopes with his girlfriend in Las Vegas. The next day, at a scheduled recording session at Play-Tone&#x27;s studio, Mr. White has provided new material for Jimmy and Guy to record, but Jimmy, insistent on recording his original songs, immediately quits when he is reminded that per their contract, Play-Tone dictates their material; Mr. White reassures Guy that short-lived one-hit wonders are common in the music industry. When Del visits the recording studio, he is impressed by Guy&#x27;s impromptu drumming and they improvise a jazz song entitled &quot;I Am Spartacus&quot; after Guy&#x27;s catchphrase. Returning to the hotel to check out, Guy tells a dejected Faye that he plans to stay in Los Angeles, while she says she will return to Erie. He pursues her and they finally admit their long-hidden feelings for each other before sharing a kiss.

An epilogue reveals that Jimmy formed a new band known as the Heardsmen, which made three albums for Play-Tone, all of which were certified Gold, before becoming a successful record producer in Los Angeles. Lenny, currently single, manages the Golden Eagle Hotel and Casino in Laughlin, Nevada, while T.B. served 2 tours of duty in Vietnam with the Marines and earned a Purple Heart for wounds sustained at the Battle of Khe Sanh, then worked in construction in Orlando, Florida as a building contractor. Finally, Guy and Faye married on April 30, 1965, and raised four children in Venice, California, before moving to Bainbridge Island, Washington, and founding the Puget Sound Conservatory of Music, where Guy teaches jazz composition.

==Cast==
==Production and music==
The film features original music by Tom Hanks, Adam Schlesinger, Rick Elias, Scott Rogness, Mike Piccirillo, Gary Goetzman and Howard Shore. In the film, the Wonders rise to brief stardom on the strength of &quot;That Thing You Do&quot;, a song written as a wistful ballad but which becomes an uptempo rocker during the band&#x27;s first performance at a talent show. Written and composed for the film by Adam Schlesinger, bassist for Fountains of Wayne and Ivy and released on the film&#x27;s soundtrack, the song became a genuine hit for the Wonders in 1996 (the song peaked at number 41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number 22 on the Adult Contemporary charts, number 18 on the Adult Top 40, and number 24 on the Top 40 Mainstream charts). The track was nominated for a 1996 Golden Globe Award as well as a 1996 Academy Award for Best Original Song. Mike Viola of the Candy Butchers provided the lead vocals for the Wonders.

In the film, the title song is referenced with &quot;All My Only Dreams&quot; as the B-side. The actual 45 rpm single, released to record stores in North America, features &quot;Dance with Me Tonight&quot; as its B-side. The song has since been recorded by the Knack, Billie Joe Armstrong, and Bubblegum Lemonade. The Wonders are also seen playing the song &quot;Little Wild One&quot;. This was written by the band Gigolo Aunts as a &quot;faux-Beatles&quot;-style tune at the request of their record label to be submitted for consideration for inclusion in the film.

To perform the Wonders&#x27; songs convincingly on-camera, Scott, Schaech, Zahn and Embry took several weeks of individual lessons, followed by daily practice as a group. Of the four, only Zahn and Embry had any prior experience of playing their assigned instruments. They eventually honed their performance to the point where extras on the set thought they were actually playing the songs, when in reality they were miming along to recordings by professional musicians.

The song that plays during the film&#x27;s opening credits, &quot;Lovin&#x27; You Lots and Lots&quot;, is credited to the fictitious Norm Wooster Singers and was actually written by Hanks. This song is a send-up of Ray Conniff, Mitch Miller, and other practitioners of the &quot;beautiful music&quot; or proto-Muzak formats that were a staple of adult radio during the early 1960s such as on KPOL (AM) 1540 in Los Angeles. Hanks also composed Guy&#x27;s jazzy signature drum solo, &quot;I Am Spartacus&quot;.

The Wonders&#x27; bassist (played by Ethan Embry) is unnamed in the film; in the end credits, he is credited as &quot;T.B. Player&quot;. This is short for &quot;the Bass Player&quot;, and is a joke based on the perception that bass players are often unknown and unappreciated. Embry later provided his own take on the character&#x27;s real name: &quot;I just said my name was Tobias, because he&#x27;s &quot;such&quot; a Tobias. You just take the vowels out [and it&#x27;s T.B.] His nickname was Toby, but his mom calls him Tobias. And his last name actually was Player, because he was a player, dude! That carousel ride with the Chantrellines? Total player.&quot;

===The real Wonders===
There were at least two real groups named the Wonders who made the record charts at various radio stations in the early 1960s. One was a soul group who had a record called &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; (b/w &quot;With These Hands&quot;; Bamboo 523) that was cited in the September 1, 1962, issue of &quot;Billboard&quot; as having &quot;moderate sales potential&quot;, but it was not successful. (The flip, however, was played by KCRG in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in the fall of 1962.)

The other Wonders had a regional hit record called &quot;Say There&quot; (b/w &quot;Marilyn&quot;; Colpix 699), released in August 1963. A mixed race doo wop group from New York City, they also recorded as the . &quot;Say There&quot; hit the Top 20 at WCOL in Columbus, Ohio, and made the top 30 at KQV in Pittsburgh. In addition, the tune made the radio publication &quot;The Gavin Report&quot; as a regional hit in their August 16, 1963, issue.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack album (released under the Playtone name in conjunction with Epic Records) was also a hit, peaking at #21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. The CD artwork is a replica of the fictional Playtone label used in the movie, and the liner notes are done in a mockumentary style, as if the Wonders had been a real group and the events of the film had actually happened. Hanks later used the success of &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot; as a springboard to launch the actual Playtone Records label, through which the soundtracks of all his subsequent films, as well as other films such as &quot;Bring It On&quot; and television programs such as &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, were released as albums.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film grossed $25.9 million domestically and $8.7 million internationally for a total worldwide gross of $34.6 million.
The film debuted at No. 3.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 94% based on reviews from 62 critics, with an average rating of 7.30/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;A light, sweet, and thoroughly entertaining debut for director Tom Hanks, &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot; makes up in charm what it lacks in complexity&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 71 out of 100 based on reviews from 22 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. 

Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;A top-notch production, exuberant period music and Hanks the actor in an important role cunningly disguised a rather slight and inconsequential narrative.&quot;
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it 3 out of 4 and wrote: &quot;The movie may be inconsequential, but in some ways that&#x27;s a strength. Without hauling in a lot of deep meanings, it remembers with great warmth a time and a place.&quot;

===Accolades===
== Reunion ==
The Erie SeaWolves hosted Wonders Night on September 4, 2021, at UPMC Park. Cast members Johnathon Schaech, Tom Everett Scott, and Steve Zahn traveled to Erie for the occasion and participated in a panel discussion, autograph session, and elements of the ballgame presentation. Cast member Ethan Embry joined the panel discussion virtually. As a result of funds collected from VIP experiences as well as memorabilia and jersey auctions, the 25th anniversary event raised $25,500 for Notice Ability, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping students with dyslexia. Additional donations were made to Notice Ability, bringing the total sum raised to nearly a quarter of a million dollars. Wonders Night also earned the SeaWolves Promotion of the Year recognition by &quot;Ballpark Digest&quot;.

==Home media==
===Initial release===
&quot;That Thing You Do!&quot; was first released in mid-1997 on VHS and Laserdisc. In 1998, the film became available in the DIVX format (as with all 20th Century Fox films), rather than DVD.

===First DVD===
After DIVX failed, the film was released on DVD on June 5, 2001. It included the featurette &quot;The Making of &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot;&quot;, and two music videos.

===Extended Edition DVD===
On May 8, 2007, &quot;Tom Hanks&#x27; Extended Edition&quot; was released on DVD. The film&#x27;s theatrical cut and an extended cut with 39 additional minutes of deleted scenes are included.

Many of the deleted scenes are devoted to character development. A tastefully steamy look at Guy&#x27;s &quot;make-out&quot; session with Tina at his apartment is included. The extended version also goes more in-depth with Guy&#x27;s developing relationship with Faye (via mild flirting) and his deteriorating relationship with Tina, as well as Tina&#x27;s budding relationship with her dentist, Dr. Collins. It also suggests that the character portrayed by Tom Hanks (Mr. White) is not only gay but in a relationship with a man played by former NFL defensive lineman Howie Long.

More camera time is also devoted to the tryst between the bass player and one of the singers of the Chantrellines. In the theatrical cut, this romance was depicted mainly as an unrequited crush on the part of the bass player; in the extended cut it is clearly shown that his efforts were successful.

At the end of the Extended Edition, rather than becoming a studio drummer on the recommendation of Del Paxton, Guy becomes a disc jockey for the jazz station KJZZ and records a documentary series of interviews with legendary jazz musicians.

===2007 DVD repackage re-release===
&quot;That Thing You Do!&quot; was packaged with &quot;Bachelor Party&quot; and &quot;The Man with One Red Shoe&quot; in the &quot;Tom Hanks Triple Feature&quot; DVD anthology set. The actual DVD appears to be the original 2001 disc, with the featurette and music videos.

===Blu-ray release===
20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray on April 2, 2013. The Blu-ray includes the Theatrical and Extended cuts as well as all of the bonus features found on the two-disc DVD.

<text>Cottbus () or  (; Polish: &quot;Chociebuż&quot; ) is a university city and the second-largest city in the German state of Brandenburg after the state capital of Potsdam. With around 100,000 inhabitants, it is the most populous city in Lusatia. Cottbus lies in the Sorbian settlement area () of Lower Lusatia, and is the second-largest city on the River Spree after Berlin, which is situated around downstream. The city is located on the shores of Germany&#x27;s largest artificial lake, the Cottbuser Ostsee ().

Cottbus is considered the political and cultural center of the Lower Sorbian-speaking Sorbs (in Lower Lusatia also called the Wends), while the overall center of all Sorbs (Lower and Upper) is Bautzen (&quot;Budyšin&quot;). Cottbus is the largest bilingual city in Germany. Signage is mostly in German and Lower Sorbian. The city is the seat of several Lower Sorbian institutions like the Lower Sorbian version of the Sorbischer Rundfunk (/), the Lower Sorbian Gymnasium, and the Wendish Museum (). The use of the Lower Sorbian language, however, is more widespread in the surrounding villages than in the city itself. Cottbus Hauptbahnhof (&quot;Chóśebuz głowne dwórnišćo&quot;) is a major railway junction with extensive sidings/depots.

In the 10th century, the Wends constructed the largest Slavic castle of Lower Lusatia, a gord, on a Spree island. This former gord is considered the nucleus of the city. On it rises the massive 13th century Castle Tower () with its blue clock.

Cottbus is the seat of the Brandenburg University of Technology (, ). Due to this, the city has the official names / (&#x27;University City Cottbus&#x27;). Branitz Castle, built in 1770–71, in the southeast of the city, was a residence of the Prince of Pückler-Muskau. The prince, who also created Muskau Park, designed the extensive Branitz Park on the shores of the Spree, with its two grass pyramids. Cottbus State Theater () is the only state theater in Brandenburg. The Wendish Quarter is a part of the city supposed to resemble the traditional Sorbian architectural style, constructed of prefabricated concrete slabs in East Germany between 1984 and 1989.

== Spelling ==
Until the beginning of the 20th century, the spelling of the city&#x27;s name was disputed. In Berlin, the spelling &quot;Kottbus&quot; was preferred, and it is still used for the capital&#x27;s (&quot;Cottbus Gate&quot;). Locally the traditional spelling &quot;Cottbus&quot; (which defies standard German-language rules) was preferred, and it is now used in most circumstances. Because the official spelling used locally before the spelling reforms of 1996 had contravened even the standardized spelling rules already in place, the () stress their urgent recommendation that geographical names should respect the national spelling standards. A citizen of the city may be identified as either a &quot;Cottbuser&quot; or a &quot;Cottbusser&quot;.

Names in different languages:
* 
* , 
* 

== History ==
The settlement was established in the tenth century, when Sorbs erected a castle on a sandy island in the River Spree. It was captured by the March of Lusatia in 965, then it passed to Poland under Bolesław I the Brave in 1002, and back to the March of Lusatia in 1032. The first recorded mention of the town&#x27;s name was in 1156. In the 13th century German settlers came to the town and thereafter lived side by side with the Sorbs.

In the Middle Ages Cottbus was known for wool, and the town&#x27;s drapery was exported throughout Brandenburg, Bohemia and Saxony. It was also located on an important trade route, called the &quot;Salt Road&quot;, which was used to transport salt from Halle to Lusatia and further east to Poland. It was part of the Margraviate of Lusatia and later Lower Lusatia, which was held by the House of Wettin until it became a Bohemian Crown Land in 1367.
In 1445 Cottbus was acquired by the Margraviate of Brandenburg from Bohemia. It was an exclave almost completely surrounded by Bohemian Lower Lusatia (with a short border with the Electorate of Saxony to the south-west). In 1514 Jan Rak founded the , a Sorbian gymnasium, in the city. In 1635 Lower Lusatia was ceded by Bohemia to Saxony, thereby making Cottbus an enclave of Saxony. In 1701 Brandenburg-Prussia became the Kingdom of Prussia.

In 1807, following the War of the Fourth Coalition, Cottbus was ceded by Prussia to the Kingdom of Saxony by the Treaty of Tilsit, reuniting it with Lower Lusatia. Cottbus was returned to Prussia by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 after the Napoleonic wars. Lower Lusatia was also ceded to Prussia and both became part of the Prussian Province of Brandenburg (and ), where they remained until 1947. In the 19th century, the &quot;Bramborski Serbski Casnik&quot; Sorbian newspaper was published in the city, and in 1880, the first Lower Lusatian department of the Maćica Serbska organization was established there.

In 1871 Prussia, and therefore Cottbus, became part of the German Empire. According to the Prussian census of 1905, the city of Cottbus had a population of 46,270, of which 97% were Germans, 2% were Sorbs and 1% were Poles.

In interwar Germany, the town was the site of a concentration camp for unwanted Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe.

During World War II, a Nazi prison for women was operated in the city with multiple forced labour subcamps located both in the city and other places in the region. Polish actor Władysław Hańcza was imprisoned in a forced labour camp in the city in 1944–1945. In the final weeks of the war, Cottbus was taken by the Red Army on 22 April 1945. In January 1946, Cottbus issued 34 semi-postal postage stamps to help finance rebuilding the city. From 1949 until German reunification in 1990, Cottbus was part of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). From 1952 to 1990, Cottbus was the administrative seat of Bezirk Cottbus.

== Boroughs ==

== Demography ==


==Climate==
Cottbus has an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) in spite of being far inland on a relatively high latitude. Summers are very warm for being so far north, while winters are often mild due to prevailing trade winds from the Atlantic Ocean facing little natural obstacles on the way to the area. When wind directions come from elsewhere, hard freezes occasionally take place. As a result, the annual temperature amplitude is quite high for an oceanic climate, ranging from in summer to in winter. Precipitation is frequent, although usually light in accumulation. Snowfall is a regular occurrence with 36 days of snow cover annually, but Cottbus remains mild enough that it usually thaws quickly. Most of the year is gloomy, with a notable exception in late spring.

== Culture and education ==
Cottbus is the cultural centre of the Lower Sorbian minority. Many signs in the town are bilingual, and there is a Lower Sorbian-medium &quot;Gymnasium&quot; and a Sorbian Quarter, but Sorbian is rarely spoken on the streets.

Next to Cottbus is the famous Branitz Park, created by Prince Hermann von Pückler-Muskau after 1845. Schloss Branitz (Branitz Castle) was rebuilt by Gottfried Semper in a late Baroque style between 1846 and 1852, and the gardens Prince Hermann laid feature two pyramids. One of these, the Seepyramide, is in the middle of an artificial lake and serves as his mausoleum.

Cottbus is also home to the Brandenburg University of Technology (BTU) and the maths/science-oriented Max-Steenbeck-Gymnasium, named after the physicist Max Steenbeck.

Every year Cottbus hosts the East Europe International Film Festival.

Cottbus has a football team, Energie Cottbus, that plays in the Regionalliga Nordost as of the 2021–2022 season. Their home matches are played at the city&#x27;s Stadion der Freundschaft.

==Economy==

===Transportation===

Cottbus is served by Cottbus Hauptbahnhof main railway station.

Two airports serve the city: Cottbus-Drewitz Airport (approximately 25 kilometres (16 mi) north-east of Cottbus), and Cottbus-Neuhausen Airport (approximately 10 km (6.2 miles) south-east of Cottbus).

Berlin Brandenburg Airport can be reached in one hour from Cottbus.

Local public transport is served by trams and buses operated by Cottbusverkehr GmbH and DB Regio Bus Ost GmbH, both of which are members of the Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg (VBB).

=== Power generation ===
There are several lignite-fired power stations in the area around Cottbus (Lausitz) fed through local open pit mining. The biggest stations are &quot;Schwarze Pumpe&quot; (1600 MW), &quot;Boxberg&quot; (1900 MW) and &quot;Jänschwalde&quot; (3000 MW). Some of the open-pit mines have already been shut down with the former being converted into an artificial lake with surface area called Cottbuser Ostsee (Cottbus eastern lake).

<text>Giorgio Vasari (30 July 1511 – 27 June 1574) was an Italian Renaissance painter, architect, art historian, and biographer who is best known for his work &quot;Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot;, considered the ideological foundation of Western art-historical writing, and still much cited in modern biographies of the many Italian Renaissance artists he covers, including Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, although he is now regarded as including many factual errors, especially when covering artists from before he was born.

Vasari was a Mannerist painter who was highly regarded both as a painter and architect in his day but rather less so in later centuries. He was effectively what would now be called the minister of culture to the Medici court in Florence, and the &quot;Lives&quot; promoted, with enduring success, the idea of Florentine superiority in the visual arts.

Vasari designed the &quot;Tomb of Michelangelo&quot;, his hero, in the Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence, that was completed in 1578. Based on Vasari&#x27;s text in print about Giotto&#x27;s new manner of painting as a &quot;rinascita&quot; (rebirth), author Jules Michelet, in his &quot;Histoire de France&quot; (1835), suggested the adoption of Vasari&#x27;s concept, using the term &quot;Renaissance&quot; (from French) to distinguish the cultural change. The term was adopted thereafter in historiography and is still in use today.

==Life==
Vasari was born prematurely on 30 July 1511 in Arezzo, Tuscany. Recommended at an early age by his cousin Luca Signorelli, he became a pupil of Guglielmo da Marsiglia, a skillful painter of stained glass. Sent to Florence at the age of sixteen by Cardinal Silvio Passerini, he joined the circle of Andrea del Sarto and his pupils, Rosso Fiorentino and Jacopo Pontormo, where his humanist education was encouraged. He was befriended by Michelangelo, whose painting style would influence his own. Vasari enjoyed high repute during his lifetime and amassed a considerable fortune. He married Niccolosa Bacci, a member of one of the richest and most prominent families of Arezzo. He was made Knight of the Golden Spur by the Pope. He was elected to the municipal council of his native town and finally, rose to the supreme office of gonfaloniere.

Vasari built a fine house in Arezzo in 1547 and decorated its walls and vaults with paintings. It is now a museum in his honour named the Casa Vasari, whilst his residence in Florence is also preserved. In 1563, he helped found the Florentine &quot;Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno&quot;, with Grand Duke Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici and Michelangelo as &quot;capi&quot; of the institution. Thirty-six artists were chosen as members. He died on 27 June 1574 in Florence, Grand Duchy of Tuscany, aged 62.

==Painting==
In 1529, he visited Rome where he studied the works of Raphael and other artists of the Roman High Renaissance. Vasari&#x27;s own Mannerist paintings were more admired in his lifetime than afterwards. In 1547, he completed the hall of the chancery in Palazzo della Cancelleria in Rome with frescoes that received the name Sala dei Cento Giorni. He was regularly employed by members of the Medici family in Florence and Rome. He also worked in Naples (for example on the Vasari Sacristy), Arezzo, and other places. Many of his paintings still exist, the most important being on the wall and ceiling of the Sala di Cosimo I in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, where he and his assistants worked from 1555. Vasari also helped to organize the decoration of the Studiolo, now reassembled in the Palazzo Vecchio.In Rome, Vasari painted frescos in the &quot;Sala Regia&quot;. Among his better-known pupils or followers are Sebastiano Flori, Bartolomeo Carducci, Mirabello Cavalori (Salincorno), Stefano Veltroni (of Monte San Savino), and Alessandro Fortori (of Arezzo). His last major commission was a vast &quot;The Last Judgement&quot; fresco on the ceiling of the cupola of the Florence Cathedral that he began in 1572 with the assistance of the Bolognese painter Lorenzo Sabatini. Unfinished at the time of Vasari&#x27;s death, it was completed by Federico Zuccari.

==Architecture==

Aside from his career as a painter, Vasari was successful as an architect. His loggia of the Palazzo degli Uffizi by the Arno opens up the vista at the far end of its long narrow courtyard. It is a unique piece of urban planning that functions as a public piazza, and which, if considered as a short street, is unique as a Renaissance street with a unified architectural treatment. The view of the Loggia from the Arno reveals that, with the Vasari Corridor, it is one of the very few structures lining the river that is open to the river and appears to embrace the riverside environment.

In Florence, Vasari also designed the long passage, now called Vasari Corridor, which connects the Uffizi with the Palazzo Pitti on the other side of the river. The corridor passes alongside the River Arno on an arcade, crosses the Ponte Vecchio, and winds around the exterior of several buildings. It was once the location of the Mercado de Vecchio. He renovated the medieval churches of Santa Maria Novella and Santa Croce. In both buildings, he removed the original rood screen and loft, and remodeled the retro-choirs in the Mannerist taste of his time.

In Santa Croce, Vasari produced the painting of &quot;The Adoration of the Magi&quot; commissioned by Pope Pius V in 1566 and completed in February 1567. It was restored recently, before being exhibited in 2011 in Rome and Naples. Eventually, it will be returned to the church of Santa Croce in Bosco Marengo (Province of Alessandria, Piedmont). In 1562, Vasari built the octagonal dome on the Basilica of Our Lady of Humility in Pistoia, an important example of High Renaissance architecture. In Rome, Vasari worked with Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola and Bartolomeo Ammannati at Pope Julius III&#x27;s Villa Giulia.

==&quot;The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot;==

Often called &quot;the first art historian&quot;, Vasari invented the genre of the encyclopedia of artistic biographies with his &quot;Le Vite de&#x27; più eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori&quot; (&quot;Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot;). This work was first published in 1550 and dedicated to Grand Duke Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici. Vasari introduced the term &quot;Rinascita&quot; (rebirth in Italian) in printed works – although an awareness of an ongoing &quot;rebirth&quot; in the arts had been in the air since the time of Alberti. Vasari&#x27;s term, applied to the change in artistic styles with the work of Giotto, eventually would become the French term &quot;Renaissance&quot; (rebirth) widely applied to the era that followed. Vasari was responsible for the modern use of the term Gothic art, as well, although he only used the word &quot;Goth&quot; in association with the German style that preceded the rebirth, which he identified as &quot;barbaric&quot;. The &quot;Lives&quot; also included a novel treatise on the technical methods employed in the arts. The book was partly rewritten and extended in 1568, with the addition of woodcut portraits of artists (some conjectural). The work shows a consistent and notorious bias in favour of Florentines and tends to attribute to them all the developments in Renaissance art – for example, the invention of engraving. Venetian art in particular (along with arts from other parts of Europe), is ignored systematically in the first edition. Between his first and second editions, Vasari visited Venice and while the second edition gave more attention to Venetian art (finally including Titian), it did so without achieving a neutral point of view.

Many inaccuracies exist within his &quot;Lives&quot;. For example, Vasari writes that Andrea del Castagno killed Domenico Veneziano, which is incorrect; Andrea died several years before Domenico. In another example, Vasari&#x27;s biography of Giovanni Antonio Bazzi, whom he calls &quot;Il Sodoma&quot;, published only in the second edition of the &quot;Lives&quot; (1568) after Bazzi&#x27;s death, condemns the artist as being immoral, bestial, and vain. Vasari dismisses Bazzi&#x27;s work as lazy and offensive, despite the artist&#x27;s having been named a Cavalier of the Supreme Order of Christ by Pope Leo X and having received important commissions for the Villa Farnese and other sites.

Vasari&#x27;s biographies are interspersed with amusing gossip. Many of his anecdotes seem plausible, while others are assumed fictions, such as the tale of young Giotto painting a fly on the surface of a painting by Cimabue that supposedly, the older master repeatedly tried to brush away (a genre tale that echoes anecdotes told of the Greek painter Apelles). He did carry out research archives for exact dates, as modern art historians do, and his biographies are considered more reliable in the case of his contemporary painters and those of the preceding generation. Modern criticism – with new materials produced by research – has revised many of his dates and facts. Vasari included a short autobiography at the end of the &quot;Lives&quot;, and added further details about himself and his family in his lives of Lazzaro Vasari and Francesco Salviati.

According to the historian Richard Goldthwaite, Vasari was one of the earliest authors to use the term &quot;competition&quot; (or &quot;concorrenza&quot; in Italian) in its economic sense. He used it repeatedly, and stressed the concept in his introduction to the life of Pietro Perugino, in explaining the reasons for Florentine artistic preeminence. In Vasari&#x27;s view, Florentine artists excelled because they were hungry, and they were hungry because their fierce competition amongst themselves for commissions kept them so. Competition, he said, is &quot;one of the nourishments that maintain them&quot;.

<doc id="102047" wikidata="Q184540" url="?curid=102047" title="Deșteaptă-te, române!">
<text>&quot;&quot; (; ) is the national anthem of Romania. It originated from a poem written during the Wallachian Revolution of 1848.

The lyrics were composed by Andrei Mureșanu and published during the 1848 revolution, initially with the name &quot;Un răsunet&quot; (&#x27;An Echo&#x27;), as a lyrical response to Vasile Alecsandri&#x27;s poem &quot;Către Români&quot; (&#x27;To Romanians&#x27;), later known as &quot;Deșteptarea României&quot; (&#x27;The Awakening of Romania&#x27;), from which Mureșanu took inspiration for many of the themes and motifs of his own lyrics, a fact that is reflected in the overall similarity between the two poems. The original text was written in the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet. It was first sung in late June in the same year in the city of Brașov, on the streets of the Șcheii Brașovului neighborhood and it became immediately the revolutionary anthem.

Since then, this patriotic song has been sung during all major Romanian conflicts, including during the 1989 anti-communist revolution. After the revolution, it became the national anthem on 24 January 1990, replacing the communist-era national anthem &quot;Trei culori&quot; (&#x27;Three Colours&#x27;).

29 July, the National Anthem Day (), is an annual observance in Romania.
The anthem was also used on various solemn occasions in the Moldavian Democratic Republic during its brief existence between 1917 and 1918. Between 1991 and 1994, &quot;&quot; was the national anthem of Moldova before it was subsequently replaced by &quot;Limba noastră&quot; (&#x27;Our Language&#x27;).

As a side note, in modern vernacular, the word, and according family, of the word “deștept” can be interpreted as “smart”. As such, a common joke for fluent speakers, when lyrics begin “ ” Can be loosely translated into “smarten-up, dear Romanian”. 

== History ==

The melody was originally a sentimental song called &quot;Din sânul maicii mele&quot; composed by Anton Pann after hearing the poem. In 1848 Andrei Mureșanu wrote the poem &quot;Un răsunet&quot; and asked Gheorghe Ucenescu, a Șcheii Brașovului Church singer, to find him a suitable melody. After Ucenescu sang him several lay melodies, Mureșanu chose Anton Pann&#x27;s song instead.

First sung during the uprisings of 1848, &quot;Deșteaptă-te române!&quot; became a favourite among Romanians and it has seen play during various historical events, including as part of Romania&#x27;s declaration of independence from the Ottoman Empire during the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), and during World War I. The song received particularly heavy radio broadcast in the days following Romanian coup d&#x27;état of 23 August 1944, when Romania switched sides, turning against Nazi Germany and joining the Allies in World War II.

After the Communist Party abolished the monarchy on 30 December 1947, &quot;Deșteaptă-te române!&quot; and other patriotic songs closely associated with the previous regime were outlawed. Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s government permitted the song to be played and sung in public, but it was not given state recognition as the national anthem of the Socialist Republic of Romania.

The song was officially adopted as the national anthem on 24 January 1990, shortly after the Romanian Revolution of December 1989.

The overall message of the anthem is a &quot;call to action&quot;; it proposes a &quot;now or never&quot; urge for change present in many national anthems like the French revolutionary song &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; – hence why Nicolae Bălcescu called it the &quot;Romanian Marseillaise&quot;.

===Another anthem===
&quot;Hora Unirii&quot; (&#x27; of the Union&#x27;), written by poet Vasile Alecsandri, which was sung a great deal on the occasion of the Union of the Principalities (1859) and on other occasions. &quot;Hora Unirii&quot; is sung on the Romanian folk tune of a slow but energetic round dance joined by the whole attendance (hora).

==Lyrics==
Romania&#x27;s national anthem has eleven stanzas. Today, only the first, second, fourth, and last are sung on official occasions, as established by Romanian law. At major events such as the National Holiday on 1 December, the full version is sung, accompanied by 21-gun salute when the President is present at the event.

<text>Transport puzzles are logistical puzzles, which often represent real-life transportation problems. The classic transport puzzle is the river crossing puzzle in which three objects are transported across a river one at time while avoiding leaving certain pairs of objects together. The term should not be confused with the usage of transport puzzle as a shortened form of transportation puzzle, representing children&#x27;s puzzles with different transportation vehicles used as puzzle pieces.

==Description==
A transport problem is one in which objects are moved from a starting position to a destination position following the logical rules of the puzzle. Transport puzzles do not necessarily involve any physical movement of objects, although they often do. Rather, they are those puzzles that consist of finding a path through the state space of the puzzle to reach the goal state. State changes can include rotations and distortions of the object being transported as well as its translation in space.

As in rearrangement puzzles, no piece is ever lost or added to the board. In contrast to rearrangement puzzles, however, transport puzzles have all persons and objects follow certain routes given on the board; they cannot be lifted off the board and placed on faraway positions that have no visible connection to the from-position. Hence transport puzzles often mean that the player has to move (physical) objects in a very restricted space. The player may or may not be part of the game (either directly, or as a player character on the board).

==Types of transport puzzles==
* Tour puzzles are first-person transport puzzles: the player does the tour him/herself or is represented by a player character on the board.
** labyrinths: player runs one convoluted path way, no dead ends.
** mazes: player runs fixed set of pathways, many dead ends.
** Sokoban-type puzzles: player pushes objects into place.
** sliding puzzles with single player, for example Rush Hour
** other first-person transport puzzles. Some of them are elimination puzzles: these are similar to Sokoban-type puzzles, but one eliminates pieces on the way rather than pushing them around.
* Other transport games: The player is not represented in the game.
** sliding puzzles: slide pieces (on a board) into place.
*** The fifteen puzzle is the best known example of these.
** train shunting puzzles: move trains and carriages along tracks.
** river crossing puzzles: move a set of pieces across a river using a bridge or boat. Certain conditions apply.

==Math==
The Seven Bridges of Königsberg is a historically notable problem in mathematics. Its negative resolution by Leonhard Euler in 1736 laid the foundations of graph theory and prefigured the idea of topology.

==Literature==
The famous British puzzler Henry Dudeney added several puzzles to this category.

Transportation puzzles can be used to study intelligence and educational issues. They are good for this purpose because, as logic puzzles, they require no outside information. Everything needed is contained within the puzzle. Also, the state-space representation makes them amenable to computer analysis, but at the same time they are appealing to human subjects of cognitive psychology experiments.

<text>Antonio Allegri da Correggio (August 1489 – 5 March 1534), usually known as just Correggio (, , , ) was an Italian Renaissance painter who was the foremost painter of the Parma school of the High Renaissance, who was responsible for some of the most vigorous and sensuous works of the sixteenth century. In his use of dynamic composition, illusionistic perspective and dramatic foreshortening, Correggio prefigured the Baroque art of the seventeenth century and the Rococo art of the eighteenth century. He is considered a master of chiaroscuro.

==Early life==
Antonio Allegri was born in Correggio, a small town near Reggio Emilia. His date of birth is uncertain (around 1489). His father was a merchant. Otherwise little is known about Correggio&#x27;s early life or training. It is, however, often assumed that he had his first artistic education from his father&#x27;s brother, the painter Lorenzo Allegri.

In 1503–1505, he was apprenticed to Francesco Bianchi Ferrara in Modena, where he probably became familiar with the classicism of artists like Lorenzo Costa and Francesco Francia, evidence of which can be found in his first works. After a trip to Mantua in 1506, he returned to Correggio, where he stayed until 1510. To this period is assigned the &quot;Adoration of the Child with St. Elizabeth and John&quot;, which shows clear influences from Costa and Mantegna. In 1514, he probably finished three tondos for the entrance of the church of Sant&#x27;Andrea in Mantua, and then returned to Correggio, where, as an independent and increasingly renowned artist, he signed a contract for the Madonna altarpiece in the local monastery of St. Francis (now in the Dresden Gemäldegalerie).

One of his sons, Pomponio Allegri, became an undistinguished painter. Both father and son occasionally referred to themselves using the Latinized form of the family name, Laeti.

==Works in Parma==
By 1516, Correggio was in Parma, where he spent most of the remainder of his career. Here, he befriended Michelangelo Anselmi, a prominent Mannerist painter. In 1519 he married Girolama Francesca di Braghetis, also of Correggio, who died in 1529. From this period are the &quot;Madonna and Child with the Young Saint John&quot;, &quot;Christ Leaving His Mother&quot; and the lost &quot;Madonna of Albinea&quot;.

Correggio&#x27;s first major commission (February–September 1519) was the ceiling decoration of a private chamber of the mother-superior (abbess Giovanna Piacenza) of the convent of St. Paul in Parma, now known as Camera di San Paolo. Here he painted an arbor pierced by oculi opening to glimpses of playful cherubs. Below the oculi are lunettes with images of statues in feigned monochromic marble. The fireplace is frescoed with an image of Diana. The iconography of the scheme is complex, combining images of classical marbles with whimsical colorful &quot;bambini&quot;.

He then painted the illusionistic &quot;Vision of St. John on Patmos&quot; (1520–21) for the dome of the church of San Giovanni Evangelista. Three years later he decorated the dome of the Cathedral of Parma with a startling &quot;Assumption of the Virgin&quot;, crowded with layers of receding figures in Melozzo&#x27;s perspective (&quot;sotto in su&quot;, from down to up). These two works represented a highly novel illusionistic &quot;sotto in su&quot; treatment of dome decoration that would exert a profound influence upon future fresco artists, from Carlo Cignani in his fresco &quot;Assumption of the Virgin&quot;, in the cathedral church of Forlì, to Gaudenzio Ferrari in his frescoes for the cupola of &quot;Santa Maria dei Miracoli&quot; in Saronno, to Pordenone in his now-lost fresco from Treviso, and to the baroque elaborations of Lanfranco and Baciccio in Roman churches. The massing of spectators in a vortex, creating both narrative and decoration, the illusionistic obliteration of the architectural roof-plane, and the thrusting perspective toward divine infinity, were devices without precedent, and which depended on the extrapolation of the mechanics of perspective. The recession and movement implied by the figures presage the dynamism that would characterize Baroque painting.

Other masterpieces include &quot;The Lamentation&quot; and &quot;The Martyrdom of Four Saints&quot;, both at the Galleria Nazionale of Parma. The &quot;Lamentation&quot; is haunted by a lambency rarely seen in Italian painting prior to this time. The &quot;Martyrdom&quot; is also remarkable for resembling later Baroque compositions such as Bernini&#x27;s &quot;Truth&quot; and Ercole Ferrata&#x27;s &quot;Death of Saint Agnes&quot;, showing a gleeful saint entering martyrdom.

==Mythological series==
Aside from his religious output, Correggio conceived a now-famous set of paintings depicting the &quot;Loves of Jupiter&quot; as described in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. The voluptuous series was commissioned by Federico II Gonzaga of Mantua, probably to decorate his private Ovid Room in the Palazzo Te. However, they were given to the visiting Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and thus left Italy within years of their completion.

&quot;Leda and the Swan&quot; – acquired by Frederick the Great in 1753; now in Staatliche Museen of Berlin – is a tumult of incidents: in the centre Leda straddles a swan, and on the right, a shy but satisfied maiden. &quot;Danaë&quot;, now in Rome&#x27;s Borghese Gallery, depicts the maiden as she is impregnated by a curtain of gilded divine rain. Her lower torso semi-obscured by sheets, Danae appears more demure and gleeful than Titian&#x27;s 1545 version of the same topic, where the rain is more accurately numismatic. The picture once called &quot;Antiope and the Satyr&quot; is now correctly identified as &quot;Venus and Cupid with a Satyr&quot;.

&quot;Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle&quot; depicts the young man aloft in literal amorous flight. Some have interpreted the conjunction of man and eagle as a metaphor for the evangelist John; however, given the erotic context of this and other paintings, this seems unlikely. This painting and its partner, the masterpiece of &quot;Jupiter and Io&quot;, are in Kunsthistorisches Museum of Vienna. &quot;Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle&quot;, one of the four mythological paintings commissioned by Federico II Gonzaga, is a proto-Baroque work due to its depiction of movement, drama, and diagonal compositional arrangement.

==Death==
Returning to his home town in later years, Correggio died there suddenly on 5 March 1534. The following day he was buried in San Francesco in Correggio near his youthful masterpiece, the &#x27;Madonna di San Francesco&#x27;, housed today in Dresden. The precise location of his tomb is now unknown.

==Evaluation==
Correggio was remembered by his contemporaries as a shadowy, melancholic, and introverted character. An enigmatic and eclectic artist, he appears to have emerged from no major apprenticeship. In addition to the influence of Costa, there are echoes of Mantegna&#x27;s style in his work, and a response to Leonardo da Vinci, as well. Correggio had little immediate influence in terms of apprenticed successors, but his works are now considered to have been revolutionary and influential on subsequent artists. A half-century after his death Correggio&#x27;s work was well known to Vasari, who felt that he had not had enough &quot;Roman&quot; exposure to make him a better painter. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, his works were often noted in the diaries of foreign visitors to Italy, which led to a reevaluation of his art during the period of Romanticism. The flight of the Madonna in the vault of the cupola of the Cathedral of Parma inspired many scenographical decorations in lay and religious palaces during those centuries.

Correggio&#x27;s illusionistic experiments, in which imaginary spaces replace the natural reality, seem to prefigure many elements of Mannerist, Baroque, and Rococo stylistic approaches. He appears to have fostered artistic grandchildren, for example, Giovannino di Pomponio Allegri (1521–1593). Correggio had no direct disciples outside of Parma, where he was influential on the work of Giovanni Maria Francesco Rondani, Parmigianino, Bernardo Gatti, Francesco Madonnina, and Giorgio Gandini del Grano.

<text>Dionysius Exiguus (Latin for &quot;Dionysius the Humble&quot;; Greek: Διονύσιος; – ) was a 6th-century Eastern Roman monk born in Scythia Minor. He was a member of a community of Scythian monks concentrated in Tomis (present-day Constanța, Romania), the major city of Scythia Minor. Dionysius is best known as the inventor of Anno Domini (AD) dating, which is used to number the years of both the Gregorian calendar and the (Christianised) Julian calendar. Almost all churches adopted his &quot;computus&quot; for the dates of Easter.

From around the year 500 until his death, Dionysius lived in Rome. He translated 401 Church canons from Greek into Latin, including the Apostolic Canons and the decrees of the First Council of Nicaea, First Council of Constantinople, Council of Chalcedon, and Council of Sardica, and a collection of the decretals of the popes from Siricius to Anastasius II. These &quot;Collectiones canonum Dionysianae&quot; had great authority in the West, and they continue to guide church administrations. Dionysius also wrote a treatise on elementary mathematics.

The author of a continuation of Dionysius&#x27;s &quot;Computus&quot;, writing in 616, described Dionysius as a &quot;most learned abbot of the city of Rome&quot;, and the Venerable Bede accorded him the honorific &quot;abbas&quot; (which could be applied to any monk, especially a senior and respected monk, and does not necessarily imply that Dionysius ever headed a monastery; indeed, Dionysius&#x27;s friend Cassiodorus stated in &quot;Institutiones&quot; that he was still an ordinary monk late in life).

==Origins==
According to his friend and fellow-student, Cassiodorus, Dionysius, although by birth a &quot;Scythian&quot;, was in character a true Roman, most learned in both tongues (by which he meant Greek and Latin). He was also a thorough catholic Christian and an accomplished Scripturist. The use of such an ambiguous, dated term as &quot;Scythian&quot; raises the suspicion that his contemporaries had difficulties classifying him, either from lack of knowledge about him personally or about his native land, Scythia Minor. By the 6th century, the term &quot;Scythian&quot; could mean an inhabitant of Scythia Minor, or simply someone from the north-east of the Greco-Roman world, centred on the Mediterranean. The term had a widely encompassing meaning, devoid of clear ethnic attributes. Even for the &quot;Scythian monk&quot; Joannes Maxentius, friend and companion of Dionysius, the two monks are &quot;Scythian&quot; by virtue of their geographical origin relative to Rome, just as Faustus of Riez is a &quot;Gaul&quot;.

The dubious assertion, based on a single Syriac source, that the Eastern-Roman rebel general Vitalian, to whom Dionysius seems to have been related, was of Gothic extraction was the basis for labelling, without any further evidence, all of the Scythian monks, Dionysius included, as &quot;Goths&quot;. In Greek and Latin sources, Vitalian is sometimes labelled with the same ambiguous term &quot;Scytha&quot;; he is presented as commanding &quot;Hunnic&quot;, &quot;Gothic&quot;, &quot;Scythian&quot;, &quot;Bessian&quot; soldiers, but this information says more about the general&#x27;s military endeavours, and bears little relevance to clarifying his origins. Furthermore, since none of the Scythian monks expressed any kinship, by blood or spiritual, with the Arian Goths who at that time ruled Italy, a Gothic origin for Dionysius is questionable. Vitalian seems to have been of local Latinised Thracian stock, born in Scythia Minor or in Moesia; his father bore a Latin name, Patriciolus, while two of his sons had Thracian names and one a Gothic name. By the time of the flourishing of the Scythian monks, the provinces from the Lower Danube, long since Latinised, were already a centre for the production of Latin-speaking theologians. Most likely Dionysius was also of local Thraco-Roman origin (romanized Geto–Dacian), like Vitalian&#x27;s family to whom he was related, and the rest of the Scythian monks and other Thraco-Roman personalities of the era (Justin I, Justinian, Flavius Aetius, etc.).

==Works and translations==
Dionysius translated standard works from Greek into Latin, principally the &quot;Life of St. Pachomius&quot;, the &quot;Instruction of St. Proclus of Constantinople&quot; for the Armenians, the &quot;De opificio hominis&quot; of St. Gregory of Nyssa, and the history of the discovery of the head of St. John the Baptist (written by Archimandrite Markellos). The translation of St. Cyril of Alexandria&#x27;s synodical letter against Nestorius, and some other works long attributed to Dionysius are now acknowledged to be earlier and are assigned to Marius Mercator.

Of great importance were the contributions of Dionysius to the tradition of canon law. His several collections embrace:

==Anno Domini==

Dionysius is best known as the inventor of Anno Domini dating, which is used to number the years of both the Gregorian calendar and the Julian calendar. He used it to identify the several Easters in his Easter table, but did not use it to date any historical event. When he devised his table, Julian calendar years were identified by naming the consuls who held office that year; he himself stated that the &quot;present year&quot; was &quot;the consulship of Probus Junior&quot;, which he also stated was 525 years &quot;since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;. How he arrived at that number is unknown, but there is evidence of the system he applied. He invented a new system of numbering years to replace the Diocletian years that had been used in an old Easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. It has been suggested that he arranged the numbers so that leap years would be exactly divisible by four, and that his new table would begin one &quot;Victorian cycle&quot; (see below), i.e. 532 years, after his new epoch.

Evidence exists that Dionysius&#x27; desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was to prevent people from believing the imminent end of the world. At the time, some believed that the Second Coming and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus. The current Anno Mundi calendar commenced with the creation of the world based on information in the Greek Septuagint. It was believed that, based on the Anno Mundi calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the Anno Mundi calendar marking the end of the world. Anno Mundi 6000 (c. 500) was thus equated with the second coming of Christ and the end of the world.

==Easter tables==
In 525, Dionysius prepared a table of 95 future dates of Easter (532–626) and a set of rules (&quot;argumenta&quot;) explaining their calculation (computus). This followed a request by Pope John I, possibly influenced by the fact that the then current Victorian table gave an Easter date for 526 (19 April) which was the 22nd day of the moon. In a previous embarrassment, this table had given Saturday, 24 April as the date of the Greek Easter in 482. Note well that only the first nine arguments are by Dionysius – arguments 10 to 16 as well as the second paragraphs of 3 and 4 and the third paragraph of 9 are later interpolations. Arguments 11 and 12 imply that these were interpolated in the year 675, shortly before Bede. Dionysius also introduced his table and arguments via a letter to a bishop Petronius (also written in 525) and added another explanatory letter (written in 526). These works in volume 67 of the 217-volume &quot;Patrologia Latina&quot; also include a letter from Bishop Proterius of Alexandria to Pope Leo (written before 457). Though not named by Dionysius, this collection was recently called his &quot;Liber de Paschate&quot; (&quot;Book on Easter&quot;) by Audette.

Dionysius ignored the existing table used by the Patriarchate of Rome, which was prepared in 457 by Victorius of Aquitaine, complaining that it did not obey Alexandrian principles, without actually acknowledging their existence. To be sure that his own table was correct, he simply extended a table prepared in Alexandria that had circulated in the west in Latin, but was never used in the west to determine the date of Easter (however, a variant of it was used in the Byzantine Empire, in Greek). The Latin table was prepared by a subordinate of Bishop Cyril of Alexandria shortly before Cyril&#x27;s death in 444. It covered a period of 95 years or five decennovenal (19-year) cycles with years dated in the Diocletian Era, whose first year was 285 (the modern historical year in progress at Easter). Diocletian years were advantageous because their division by 19 yielded a remainder equal to the year of the decennovenal cycle 

Ultimately, Dionysius Exiguus&#x27; Easter table, meanwhile extended from the years 532–626 to the years 532–721, must have been adopted at Rome and also have arrived in Britain and Ireland, where, however in both cases certainly not before the second quarter of the seventh century, Victorius of Aquitaine&#x27;s lunar limits 16–22 were gradually replaced with Dionysius’ lunar limits 15–21; only then the discord between the churches of Rome and Alexandria regarding the correct date for the celebration of Easter came to an end, and only from then both these authoritative churches used identical tables and hence observed Easter on the same day.

The Greek tables had begun with the new moon which fell (on 29 August) the day before the starting date of their chronology, which was 30 August 284. The epact thus calculated was carried over unchanged by Dionysius into his tables together with a number from one to seven, calculated annually, called by the Greeks the &quot;day of the [planetary] gods&quot; and in the west the &quot;concurrent&quot;. This number the Greeks used for calculating the day of the week for any date in the Alexandrian civil calendar (a late form of the Egyptian solar calendar which included a final leap day every four years), which involved no more than simple arithmetic because the twelve months ran consecutively and all had thirty days. These two variables were understood neither by Dionysius nor by the other western computists, who were used to working with the age of the moon on 1 January and the Sunday letters to determine the Sundays. This is why the tables took so long to gain acceptance, but the values were eventually assimilated into the theory, the concurrent as the weekday of 24 March and the epact as the age of the moon on 22 March.

Dionysius Exiguus’ Paschal table owes its strong structure to his distant predecessor Anatolius, who invented the Metonic 19-year lunar cycle, which is an application of the Metonic cycle in the Julian calendar. Its lunar cycle is the nearby variant of Theophilus&#x27; 19-year lunar cycle proposed by Annianus and adopted by bishop Cyril of Alexandria in the first half of the fifth century. The Metonic structure of this so-called classical Alexandrian 19-year lunar cycle contained in Dionysius Exiguus’ Paschal table is reflected by the structure of its 19-year periodic sequence of epacts.

The epact, since it originally marked the new moon, was zero in all first decennovenal years. The Latin word &quot;nulla&quot; meaning &quot;no/none&quot; was used because no Roman numeral for zero existed. To determine the decennovenal year, the Dionysian year plus one was divided by 19. If the result was zero (to be replaced by 19), it was represented by the Latin word &quot;nvlla&quot;, also meaning &quot;nothing&quot;. Both &quot;zeros&quot; continued to be used by (among others) Bede, by whose extension of Dionysius Exiguus’ Easter table to a great Easter cycle all future Julian calendar dates of Easter Sunday were fixed unambiguously at last. However, in medieval Europe one had to wait as late as the second millennium to see the number zero itself come into use, although it had come into being around the year 600 in India.

Dionysius copied the last decennovenal cycle of the Cyrillian table ending with Diocletian 247, and then added a new 95-year table with numbered &quot;Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi&quot; (&quot;Years of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;) because, as he explained to Petronius, he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The only reason he gave for beginning his new 95-year table with the year 532 was that six years were still left in the Cyrillian table after the year during which he wrote. For the current year he only stated that it was 525 years after the Incarnation of Christ, without stating when this event occurred in any other calendar. He did &quot;not&quot; realise that the dates of the Alexandrian Easter repeated after 532 years, despite his apparent knowledge of the Victorian 532-year &#x27;cycle&#x27;, indicating only that Easter did not repeat after 95 years. He knew that Victorian Easters did not agree with Alexandrian Easters, thus he no doubt assumed that they had no bearing on any Alexandrian cycle. Furthermore, he obviously did not realise that simply multiplying 19 by 4 by 7 (decennovenal cycle × cycle of leap years × days in a week) fixed the Alexandrian cycle at 532 years.

Most of the British Church accepted the Dionysian tables after the Synod of Whitby in 664, which agreed that the old British method (the &quot;insular latercus&quot;) should be dropped in favour of the Roman one. Quite a few individual churches and monasteries refused to accept them, the last holdout finally accepting them during the early 10th century. After the first Frankish adaptation of Bede&#x27;s &quot;The Reckoning of Time&quot; was published (by 771), the Church of the Franks (France) accepted them during the late 8th century under the tutelage of Alcuin, after he arrived from Britain.

Ever since the 2nd century, some bishoprics in the eastern Roman Empire had counted years from the birth of Christ, but there was no agreement on the correct epoch – Clement of Alexandria () and Eusebius of Caesarea () wrote about these attempts. Because Dionysius did not place the Incarnation in an explicit year, competent scholars have deduced both AD 1 and 1 BC. The reason for his omission may be simply that the starting date was computationally convenient, or that he did not believe that the date of the Nativity could be pinpointed exactly. Ambiguities arise from the fact that eras may be either elapsed or current years, there are discrepancies in the lists of consuls, and there is disagreement as to whether the Incarnation should be reckoned from the Annunciation or the Nativity. Most scholars have selected 1 BC (historians do not use a year zero), arguing that because the anniversary of the Incarnation was 25 March, which was near Easter, a year that was 525 years &quot;since the Incarnation&quot; implied that 525 whole years were completed near that Easter. Consequently, one year since the Incarnation would have meant 25 March AD 1, meaning that Dionysius placed the Incarnation on 25 March 1 BC. Because the birth of Jesus was nine calendar months later, Dionysius implied, but never stated, that Jesus was born 25 December 1 BC. Only one scholar, Georges Declerq (Declerq, 2002), thinks that Dionysius placed the Incarnation and Nativity in AD 1, basing his conclusion on the structure of Dionysius&#x27;s Easter tables. In either case, Dionysius ignored his predecessors, who usually placed the Nativity in the year we now label 2 BC. In his 1605 thesis, the Polish historian Laurentius Suslyga was the first to suggest that Christ was actually born around 4 BC, deriving this from the chronology of Herod the Great, his son Philip the Tetrarch, and the daughter of Augustus, Julia. Having read Suslyga&#x27;s work, Kepler noted that Christ was born during the reign of King Herod the Great (2:1–18), whose death he placed in 4 BC. Kepler chose this year because Josephus stated that a lunar eclipse occurred shortly before Herod&#x27;s death. John Pratt of the International Planetarium Society proposed the 29 December 1 BC eclipse as another eclipse. According to Josephus, Herod died in the year 4 or 3 BC.

Although Dionysius stated that the First Council of Nicaea in 325 sanctioned his method of dating Easter, that is only generally true. There was no formal canon – the Council echoed Canon 1 of the first Council of Arles (314) which had decreed that the Christian Passover be celebrated &quot;uno die et uno tempore per omnem orbem&quot; (on one day and at one time through all the world) – but added that all &quot;celebrate Pascha at the same time as&quot; the churches of Alexandria and Rome.

A synodal letter to the church of Alexandria states:
All our eastern brothers who up until now have not been in agreement with the Romans or you or with all those who from the beginning have done as you do, will henceforth celebrate Pascha at the same time as you.

And the letter of the Emperor Constantine to bishops who had not attended the council states:
It was judged good and proper, all questions and contradictions being left aside, that the eastern brothers follow the example of the Romans and Alexandrians and all the others so that everyone should let their prayers rise to heaven on one single day of holy Pascha.
Dionysius&#x27; method had actually been used by the Church of Alexandria (but not by the Church of Rome) at least as early as 311, and probably began during the first decade of the 4th century, its dates naturally being given in the Alexandrian calendar. Thus Dionysius did not develop a new method of dating Easter. The most that he may have done was convert its arguments from the Alexandrian calendar into the Julian calendar. The resulting Julian date for Easter was the Sunday following the first Luna XIV (the 14th day of the moon) that occurred on or after the &quot;XII Kalendas Aprilis&quot; (21 March) (12 days before the first of April, inclusive). The 14th day of the moon, Nisan 14, was the date that paschal lambs were slain (in late afternoon) until the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 prevented their continuing sacrifice, as well as the day when all leavened bread crumbs had to be collected and burned, hence Nisan 14 was the day of preparation for Passover (). Alexandria may have chosen it because it was the day that Christ was crucified according to the Gospel of John (18:28, 19:14), in direct contradiction to the Synoptic Gospels (, Mark 14:12, and Luke 22:7), who state that he was crucified after he ate the Seder, his Last Supper. Then and now, the Seder was eaten after sundown at the beginning of Nisan 15. Because Dionysius&#x27;s method of computing Easter used dates in the Julian calendar, it is also called the Julian Easter. This Easter is still used by all Orthodox churches, even those which have regularized the rest of their calendars with the West. The Gregorian Easter still uses the same definition, but relative to its own solar and lunar dates.

<text>Basutoland was a British Crown colony that existed from 1884 to 1966 in present-day Lesotho, bordered with the Cape Colony, Natal Colony and Orange River Colony until 1910 and completely surrounded by South Africa from 1910. Though the Basotho (then known as Basuto) and their territory had been under British control starting in 1868 (and ruled by Cape Colony from 1871), the rule by Cape Colony was unpopular and unable to control the territory. As a result, Basutoland was brought under direct authority of Queen Victoria, via the High Commissioner, and run by an Executive Council presided over by a series of British Resident Commissioners.

It was divided into seven administrative districts: Berea, Leribe, Maseru, Mohale&#x27;s Hoek, Mafeteng, Qacha&#x27;s Nek and Quthing.

Basutoland gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 4 October 1966 and was renamed the Kingdom of Lesotho.

==History==

===Background===
Between 1856 and 1868 the Basotho engaged in conflict with the Orange Free State. Their king, Moshoeshoe I, sought British protection. On 29 August 1865, he wrote to Sir Philip Wodehouse, the Governor of Cape Colony:

In July 1866, after referring to the former letter, the Chief said:

Eventually, in January 1868, the Governor received a document dated 9 December 1867, signed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, authorizing the annexation of Basutoland to the Colony of Natal (not to the Cape as Wodehouse had wished). On 12 March 1868, a proclamation declared the Basotho to be British subjects and Basutoland to be British territory. It was not in fact annexed to Natal, as Natal attempted unsuccessfully to condition its acceptance on Basotho land being made available for European settlement; so for some time Basutoland remained under the direct authority of Wodehouse as British High Commissioner for South Africa.
Three years later, Basutoland was annexed to the Cape Colony by Act No. 12 of 1871 of the Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope, confirmed by an Order in Council of 3 November 1871. The rule of the Cape Colony then proved unpopular with the people, leading to the Basuto Gun War of 1880–1881.

By an Order in Council dated 2 February 1884, which came into force on 18 March 1884, royal assent was given to a Cape bill repealing the Act of 1871. Basutoland was thus brought under the direct authority of the Queen, with legislative and executive powers again vested in the High Commissioner.

===As a crown colony===
Moshoeshoe had been succeeded as paramount chief by his son, Letsie I, and he in turn was succeeded in 1891 by Lerotholi Letsie I. These chieftains acted in concert with the British representative in the country, to whom was given the title of resident commissioner. The first commissioner was Sir Marshal James Clarke. The period of warfare over, the Basotho turned their attention more and more to agricultural pursuits and Christian missionaries entered the territory. Trade increased, and in 1891 Basutoland was admitted to the customs union, which already existed between Orange Free State, Cape Colony and British Bechuanaland. When Alfred Milner visited Basutoland in 1898, on his way to Bloemfontein, he was received by 15,000 mounted Basotho. The chiefs also attended a large meeting at Maseru. On the outbreak of the Boer War in 1899, these same chiefs proclaimed loyalty to the British Crown. They remained passive throughout the War and the neutrality of the country was respected by both armies. One chief alone sought to take advantage of the situation by disloyal action, and his offence was met by a year&#x27;s imprisonment.

In pursuance of the policy of encouraging the self-governing powers of the Basotho, a national council was instituted and held its first sitting in July 1903. In August 1905 the paramount chief Lerotholi died. In early life he had distinguished himself in the wars with the Boers, and in 1880 he took an active part in the revolt against the Cape government. Since 1884 he had been a loyal supporter of the imperial authorities, and carried a reputation for high diplomatic gifts. On the 19th of September following Lerotholi&#x27;s death, the national council, with the concurrence of the imperial government, elected his son Letsie II as paramount chief. The completion in October 1905 of a railway connecting Maseru with the South African railway system proved a great boon to the community. During the Bambatha Rebellion in 1906 the Basotho remained perfectly quiet.

===Interwar period===
The first task of the Basuto National Council was to revise and draft the &quot;old laws of Moshoeshoe I&quot;, which they did within three days. These new laws were called the &quot; Laws of Lerotholi&quot; after the sitting Paramount Chief. However the commoners believed that the Chiefs who sat on the council did not follow these laws, leading to opposition by the Commoners Council, one of the earliest political organizations in the territory. This forced the council to pass reforms, recommended in a 1935 study of Basutoland by British official Alan Pim. This reduced the number of chiefs and their judicial powers. The legality of the National Council itself and the laws it passed came to the forefront in 1940, with a succession crisis caused by the death of Paramount Chief Seeiso Griffith. The regency for his two-year-old son was disputed by his brother Bereng Griffith and his first wife Mantsebo, who had the support of the Resident Commissioner. It was ruled in 1942 in the Basutoland High Court that the &quot;Laws of Lerotholi&quot; were not legally binding and that the British High Commissioner for Southern Africa could choose who they wanted as the Paramount Chief. This led to efforts by the Basotho to convert the National Council into a legislative institution. The country was also badly affected by a combination of land shortages, drought and the arrival of railways. This led to the colony being a net importer of food and an exporter of labor, mostly to the neighboring South Africa. This was addressed in the 1935 study by Pim, who recommended increased investment in agriculture and efforts to stop soil erosion in the territory. This resulted in reforms by the Basutoland government to reduce erosion such as creating buffer strips and cattle grazing schedules. These were met with opposition from the native Basuto due to the fact that it was run mostly by South African administrators and often increased erosion in many places. Development projects that took place in the 1950s also met with similar opposition from the natives, due to the fact that they had very little input into how these projects were managed.

===Self government===

From the creation of the Union of South Africa in 1910 the South African government made numerous overtures to take over the High Commission Territories, which included Basutoland. However these demands were refused by Britain, wanting to consult with the inhabitants of the territories regarding their future. With the election of the National Party 1948 opposition to union with South Africa increased both amongst the Basuto and the British, due to the apartheid policies implemented by the new government. This hastened the progress towards independence. After WW2 progress towards self government and independence was slow due to opposition from local Basotho chiefs who feared losing their power and resistance from local colonial officials. In 1959 the Basutoland National Council, a body established in 1903, became a semi legislative body consisting of 80 members, half of whom were to be elected by the district councils. The others were tribal chiefs, nominated by the Paramount Chief and four officials. In the elections that followed the African nationalist Basutoland Congress Party achieved the overwhelming majority of elected seats.

===Independence===

In 1964 a constitutional conference in London resulted in the enactment of a new constitution which gave the country full self government with the Paramount Chief at its head assisted by a bicameral Parliament. The British Resident Commissioner was left only with the responsibilities of external affairs, defense and internal security. It was also decided that one year after elections were held under the new constitution the new Parliament could request independence. In the 1965 elections the conservative and pro South African Basutoland National Party, under chief Leabua Jonathon, won a narrow majority, with 31 seats out of the 60 seats in the National Assembly. Independence came as promised a year later in 1966, despite opposition from both the Paramount Chief who resented the reductions in his power as established by the 1964 Constitution and the opposition, who feared that Jonathon&#x27;s pro South African stance would result in the country becoming a vassal to the Apartheid regime. The challenge the country faced at independence was that it was underdeveloped and completely economically dependent on neighboring South Africa. This was mostly due to a lack of interest from Britain in developing the territory. This fact was acknowledged by the last British Commissioner, Sir Alexander Giles who wrote:

==Government==

===Executive branch===
Basutoland&#x27;s Executive Council members were the resident commissioner, who presided, three &quot;ex-officio&quot; members and four council members from the Basutoland National Council, appointed by the resident commissioner, one by the Paramount Chief and three nominated by the Council itself, selected by secret ballot.

===Legislative branch===
The legislative council, known as the Basutoland National Council, consisted of a non-voting President appointed by the Resident Commissioner, four official members (ex officio), twenty-two Chiefs, forty elected members elected by District Councils, and fourteen nominated members appointed by the Resident Commissioner on the nomination of the Paramount Chief. The Resident Commissioner had the right to address the council.

The Commissioner had authority to make laws by Proclamation on certain subjects, such as external affairs, defence and the public service. These matters were excluded from the powers of the National Council, but the Commissioner was required to lay a draft of any Proclamation before the council and to consider their observations. The Constitution made special provision regarding particular objections made by the council.

===Paramount Chief===
There was a College of Chiefs of Basutoland whose function related to matters pertaining to the offices of the Paramount Chief, Chief and Headman. Their decisions and recommendations were submitted for acceptance to the Paramount Chief. They were subject to review by the High Court.

The Constitution vested a number of functions in the Paramount Chief. In exercising these, he was required in most cases to consult either with the Executive Council or with the Resident Commissioner, a Council member of the Executive and a member of the Basotho Nation appointed by himself.

Land in Basutoland was vested by the Constitution in the Paramount Chief in trust for the Basotho Nation, subject to lawfully acquired rights.

==Demographics==
Considering the extensive area of uninhabitable mountain land it contained, the territory supported a mediocre population. The inhabitants increased from 128,206 in 1875, to 348,848 in 1904. Women outnumbered men by about 20,000, which was, however, about the number of adult men away from the country at any given period. The majority lived in the district between the Maloti Mountains and the Caledon River. The great bulk of the people were Basotho, but there were some thousands of Barolong and other natives. The White inhabitants in 1904 numbered 895. Maseru, the seat of government, had in 1904 a population of about 1,000 including some 100 Europeans.

==Economy== 
Throughout the period of British rule the country remained economically underdeveloped and under the control of the tribal chiefs. This lack of interest in development can be explained by the fact that until the 1950s the primary focus of the colonial administration was the maintenance of law and order rather than economic development. This, combined with a desire from the Colonial Office in London not to spend much money through aid on what it considered a backwater and low government revenue meant that until independence little significant economic development took place in the territory. This lack of development meant that the colony was reliant on food and health services from South Africa. Furthermore, key part of its economy was also dependent on remittances from Basotho workers in South Africa. This led to the perception amongst the Basotho that they were little more than a &quot;Bantustan&quot; of South Africa. However, as independence approached more international organisations, like the American Peace Corps and the World Bank began to provide funding towards economic growth and development. The British also began providing more money to the government through the Colonial Development Fund throughout the 1950s and 1960s.

<doc id="102062" wikidata="Q5290328" url="?curid=102062" title="Dominator culture">
<text>Dominator culture refers to a model of society where fear and force maintain rigid understandings of power and superiority within a hierarchical structure. Futurist and writer Riane Eisler first popularized this term in her book &quot;The Chalice and the Blade&quot; (HarperCollins San Francisco, 1987). In it, Eisler positions the dominator model in contrast to the partnership model, a more egalitarian structure of society founded on mutual respect among its inhabitants. In dominator culture, men rule over women, whereas partnership culture values men and women equally.

Other theorists, including Terence McKenna and bell hooks, have expanded on the implications and impact of dominator culture. They, among others, argue that adherence to the dominator model over the partnership model denies the possibility of a more equal society, systematically allowing for the persecution of those who are &quot;dominated&quot;—including racial and ethnic minorities, LGBT people, and women.

== Concept and terminology ==
Riane Eisler presents dominator culture as a cultural construction of the roles and relations of women and men, where men &quot;dominate&quot;, or are in control within society. Regardless of the location, time period, religious beliefs, or advancements in technology, a society might follow the dominator culture model. Eisler characterizes dominator culture as featuring four core elements:
* an authoritarian social and family structure
* rigid male dominance
* a high level of violence and abuse
* and a system of beliefs that normalizes such a society 
The dominator model is framed in contrast to the partnership model. In a sort of reversal of the elements of dominator culture, the partnership model is characterized by:
* organization according to the ideals of a democratic structure
* equal partnership between men and women
* a lack of tolerance for abuse and violence
* and belief systems that validate an empathetic perspective 
By juxtaposing dominator culture with partnership culture, Eisler creates a continuum between the two. She argues that where a society falls on this spectrum influences its culture, beliefs, and actions. Adherence to dominator culture affects people from a personal to a public level, as seen in its societal impact.

=== Historical context ===

The prevalence of dominator culture has shifted over time. Eisler claims that, in the prehistory of humans, partnership used to be the norm. In both the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods, there are examples of matriarchal societies preceding patriarchies. British archaeologist James Mellaart, for example, reported a Neolithic site with many female images and no signs of destructive warfare for almost 1000 years. For thousands of years, people lived in these peaceful partnership societies, until warlike nomadic tribes disrupted the balance with their dominator cultures. Since then, fluctuations between dominator and partnership societies have occurred over time, but the primary shift has been towards dominator culture.

== Societal impact ==
Dominator culture impacts the way a society appears and functions. Eisler posits that &quot;narratives about our cultural origins&quot;, like dominator culture, &quot;reflect and guide how we think, feel, and act.&quot; Though no culture is fully dominator or fully partnership in its construction, the degree to which it aligns with one of these models impacts the beliefs, institutions, and relationships of that society.

=== Gender inequalities ===
The main distinction between the dominator and partnership models, according to Eisler, is their treatment of the relationships between men and women. She argues that, historically, men have been the dominators, leading to patriarchal society that upholds constricting, traditional gender roles. Surveys by anthropologists Peggy R. Sanday and Scott Coltrane support this connection, showing the correlation between a society&#x27;s structure and the expectations for men and women. They found that greater equality between men and women led to greater male involvement in childcare. However, because dominator culture upholds a harsh division between masculinity and femininity, it dissociates masculinity from anything stereotypically feminine—even at the expense of benefits such as those reported by Sanday and Coltrane. Accordingly, in these societies that prize domination and power, the societal value for qualities like empathy, caregiving, and nonviolence diminishes. Instead, by viewing femininity as undesirable and inferior, these dominator societies accept and perpetuate violent and inequitable behavior.

=== Power disparities ===
In dominator culture, society reinforces such hierarchies by presenting the dominator model as the natural order of society. According to Eisler, some sociobiologists and psychologists claim that male dominance is inherent in human genes and a product of evolution, demonstrating dominator thinking. Theorist bell hooks has expanded on this, indicating that dominator culture &quot;teaches us that we are all natural-born killers but that males are more able to realize the predator role.&quot; By accepting male dominance as a genetic imperative, society justifies a dominator structure. Consequently, this situates the desire to overpower and control others as part of human identity, according to hooks.

This hierarchical disparity is not only explained genetically but societally reinforced, extending to &quot;power&quot; more generally. Although Eisler often distinguishes between the two models on the basis of gender, she also applies these hierarchies more broadly to other societal constructions of power, like race, class, and age. Terence McKenna, a friend of Eisler&#x27;s and fellow writer, asserts that Eisler&#x27;s book &quot;The Chalice and the Blade&quot; &quot;de-genderized the terminology&quot;, framing it as a contrast between dominator and partnership ideologies, rather than just an indictment of patriarchy. Supporting this interpretation, Eisler argues that society&#x27;s requirement of children to be submissive and obedient to their parents reflects the influence of dominator culture. Dominator culture encourages the ideology, from childhood, that one either dominates or is dominated. Accordingly, dominator culture not only equates the difference between men and women to superiority and inferiority, but rather &quot;frame[s] all relationships as power struggles.&quot;

== Historical and cultural implications ==
Dominator culture has had varying manifestations in society throughout the course of human history, from the prehistoric warlike tribes of the Neolithic era to present-day displays. The dominator structure of society dictates and shapes the culture that accompanies it. Other authors have used, expanded on, and interpreted Eisler&#x27;s idea of dominator culture to apply it to a wide range of fields, as far-reaching as nursing, war, language learning, economics, and ecofeminism.

=== Historical and cultural manifestations ===

Author Malcolm Hollick cites Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and Islamic fundamentalist states as modern, though severe, examples of dominator societies. The Nazi claim to power, for example, was also accompanied by the call for women&#x27;s return to &quot;traditional&quot;, or subservient, places in family structures. However, manifestations of dominator culture are not always so extreme; the effects of dominator culture often manifest in pervasive and subtle ways in society. In the United States, the wars on terror, drugs, and crime perpetuate the use of force to achieve an end and indicate a lessening of certain freedoms. On a larger scale, sex-slavery, forced marriage, and the acceptance of wife-beating persist around the world. Though the Western world has made considerable strides towards a more partnership society in the past few centuries—Western society boasts of freedom of speech, access to education, political participation, gay rights, and women in the workforce—the shift towards the partnership model is neither universal nor complete.

Similarly, dominator culture threatens the preservation of the environment. Hierarchical societies that value claiming control justify humans&#x27; claims of dominion over nature. McKenna expanded on Eisler&#x27;s work, using the idea of dominator culture to illuminate the character of what he sees as Western patriarchal culture—indicating, for example, his claims that it perennially lacks social conscience and lacks concern for the environment. He argues that, &quot;The entire structure of dominator culture ... is based upon our alienation from nature, from ourselves, and from each other.&quot; As a result, dominator culture not only accepts but justifies the pollution and destruction of the environment. Daniel Quinn, a philosophical and environmental writer, takes on these issues in his novel &quot;Ishmael&quot;, characterizing dominator culture as Taker culture and detailing its incompatibility with the environment.

The term has been used and expanded upon by other writers, such as
* Carol J. Adams in &quot;The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory&quot; (1990)
* Fritjof Capra in &quot;The Turning Point&quot; (1982)
* Thom Hartmann in &quot;The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight&quot; (1999)
* Leonard Shlain in &quot;The Alphabet Versus the Goddess&quot; (1998)
* Starhawk in &quot;Dreaming the Dark&quot; (1982)
* bell hooks in &quot;Teaching Community: A Pedagogy of Hope&quot; (2003)
* Walter Wink in &quot;Engaging the Powers: Discernment and Resistance in a World of Domination&quot; (1992) and other books on the Myth of Redemptive Violence

=== Consequences for the future ===

Despite the stability and fairness characteristic of partnership society, dominator culture often still takes precedence. Eisler argues that blindly accepting dominator culture as part of the genetic, natural order of the world excuses human responsibility. When people understand dominator culture as a genetic imperative, they ignore environmental influences, including parenting. This perpetuates the cycle of dominator culture and ignores scientific findings that contradict the supposedly genetic nature of violence. By accepting dominator culture as the norm, people discount their own claim to agency. However, in her article &quot;Love as the Practice of Freedom&quot;, bell hooks offers a potential counter to dominator culture. She states that love—the &quot;longing to connect with someone radically different&quot;—led people to overcome dominator thinking in action, whether the issue was &quot;ending racism, sexism, homophobia, or class elitism.&quot; Ultimately, Eisler acknowledges that cultural transformation does not happen on its own; however, she asserts, &quot;Many of us worldwide are working for cultural transformation, for a shift to a more peaceful, equitable, and sustainable way of relating to one another and our Mother Earth.&quot;

<doc id="102063" wikidata="Q2431741" url="?curid=102063" title="Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve">
<text>Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve is a protected area, on the fringe of Namadgi National Park. Tidbinbilla is a short drive from the capital city of Australia, Canberra, in the Australian Capital Territory. 

The nature reserve consists of a large valley floor, the Tidbinbilla Mountain and the Gibraltar range. The sides of the valley are steep and relatively undisturbed. The lower slopes of the valley are partly cleared and have a significant history of Aboriginal and European use. Tidbinbilla Mountain is believed to have been used for Aboriginal initiation ceremonies. The word &#x27;Tidbinbilla&#x27; is Aboriginal in origin and comes from the word &quot;Jedbinbilla&quot; – a place where boys become men.

Known sites of Aboriginal significance at Tidbinbilla include the Birriagi Rock Shelter, which is the oldest Aboriginal site within the Australian Capital Territory. Bogong Rocks is a shelter where the oldest evidence of Aboriginal occupation was found at a bogong moth resting site.

The nature reserve is classified as an IUCN Category II protected area. It is the traditional Country of the Ngunnawal people.

==History==

===Indigenous history===

Aboriginal people have inhabited the Tidbinbilla area since antiquity. Archaeological digs at Birrigai, over the hill from Tidbinbilla, found the earliest evidence of the use of fire, dated at 20,000 years old. This was at the time of the last ice age. Excavations at Hanging Rock has dated occupation of that site to some 16,000 years.

The name Tidbinbilla is derived from the Aboriginal word &#x27;Jedbinbilla&#x27; meaning a place where boys become men. The last corroboree, an Australian Aboriginal dance ceremony, held at Tidbinbilla was circa 1904. There are aboriginal rock paintings to be found at Gibraltar Peak in a small cave.

===European history===
There are over 100 years of European occupancy within the nature reserve. &quot;Nil Desperandum&quot; and &quot;Rock Valley&quot; Homestead are both pise rammed earth buildings built in the 1890s. Both buildings were built by George Green and George Hatcliff. &quot;Nil Desperandum&quot; is a historic four-roomed residence alongside Hurdle Creek first occupied by Henry French Gillman. The remains of a commercial camellia plantation and the best preserved eucalyptus distillery in the ACT are also nearby.

The &quot;Rock Valley&quot; Homestead was occupied by the Green family. &quot;Nil Desperandum&quot; was later occupied by George Greens daughter Elsie Jane and her husband Eric Blewitt from the early 1930s to the early 1950s when Eric was killed drenching a horse.

Both &quot;Nil Desperandum&quot; and the &quot;Rock Valley Homestead&quot; buildings were severely damaged during the 2003 Canberra bushfires. Nil Desperandum has since been rebuilt in its original condition and design with the kitchen extension but not the enclosed side verandah that the two brothers John Douglas (Doug) &amp; Cyril Leslie (Ned) both slept in.

== History of the nature reserve ==

In 1936 about were set aside as a public reserve. In 1939 a koala enclosure was built by the Institute of Anatomy. The government acquired additional land to establish a national park and fauna reserve in 1962, extending the national park to . Tidbinbilla was later expanded again to its current size.

In 1966 the park saw the appointment of park ranger and later manager, David Bruce Kerr. He developed many of the bush walking tracks, enclosures, water fowl areas and roads throughout the park. Under his management the Cape Barren goose enclosure and conservation scheme was developed which has significantly contributed to the survival of the endangered species. In 1969 the first wildlife displays were created. David oversaw the importation of Victorian koalas to the park, the establishment of kangaroo enclosures and the creation of the water fowl areas. Many of the picnic areas enjoyed by generations of visitors were established under his management. David left Tidbinbilla in 1974 to oversee the foundation of Namadgi National Park.

In 1971 the nature reserve was officially gazetted.

The Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve is located adjacent to the Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex, part of the NASA Deep Space Network.

1988 saw one of the world&#x27;s first international TV satellite linkups &quot;World Safari&quot; be broadcast from Tidbinbilla&#x27;s kangaroo enclosure. The ABC linked up with fellow broadcasters across the globe in a live natural history program, which was an idea from David&#x27;s daughter, Fiona Kerr.

In 2003, bush fires devastated the nature reserve with many of the koala population being lost to the fires. The Manager&#x27;s Residence was also lost and there was damage to the Heritage listed Rock Valley and Nil Desperandum homesteads.

On 7 November 2008, the nature reserve was added to the Australian National Heritage List as one of eleven areas constituting the Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves.

Since 2011, Tidbinbilla has taken the charge of breeding of the critically endangered Northern Corroboree Frog, the Southern Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby and the Eastern Bettong on behalf of the ACT Government. It has been successful in the endeavour over the years.

== Fauna ==
Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve has a wide variety of bushwalks - ranging from 30 minutes to over 6 hours. It is a native habitat for kangaroos, wallabies, platypus, koalas, lyrebirds, emus, and other wildlife. Ninety-nine percent of the park was burnt out in the Bendora bushfire of 18 January 2003, resulting in the loss of countless numbers of wildlife. Of the captive animals, only one koala, six rock wallabies, five potoroos, four freckled ducks, and nine black swans survived the bushfire.

== Walking tracks ==
There are a variety of walking trails which enable people to explore the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve. There is a trail to suit all fitness levels and lengths of walks range from 30 minutes to 6 hours.

=== Congwarra Trail ===
The Congwarra trail is ideal for families. It is a 3–4 km walk that will take visitors approximately 1 hour to complete. This trail starts at the Visitor Centre and leads to the Nature Discovery Playground and picnic area. The playground design is inspired by the Tidbinbilla Valley and blends into the surrounding environment in an effort to preserve the park&#x27;s natural beauty.

=== Birrigai Time Trail ===
The Birrigai Time Trail is an easy 3 km walk that takes visitors back in time to explore the local Aboriginal and European heritage. Birrigai is the Ngunnawal word for laughter. This trail is a predominantly flat walk that starts at the Visitor Centre and ends at the Birrigai Rock Shelter. Birrigai is the Ngunnawal word for laughter.

The Birrigai Rock Shelter is the oldest Aboriginal rock shelter in the ACT. It is highly valued by the local Aboriginal community as it has a high level of cultural significance. Artefacts have been found at the shelter dating back 25,000 years.

=== Turkey Hill Trail ===
This short trail is approximately 500m and will take visitors 15 minutes. Granite boulders and panoramic mountains surround this  as visitors make their way up to Turkey Hill. Drive from the Visitor Centre to the Dalsetta carpark to access the start of this trail.

=== Xanthorrhoea Loop ===
Start this walk at Dalsetta carpark and follow the small brown signs that line the trail. This trail overlaps with the longer Gibraltar Peak trail.

Xanthorrhoea Loop is named after the Xanthorrhoea group of 30 species of native Australian plants. This group of plants are commonly referred to as grass trees are seen along the trail.

=== Church Rock Heritage Loop ===
This walk starts at the Flints BBQ area in Tidbinbilla and is 2.5 km long. It is an easy walk designed for low intensity exercise.

The walk takes visitors past early European settler sites and remains which date back to the late 1800s. Explore the history of the Flints Homestead and Sheedy&#x27;s Home Site as the path slowly winds up the hillside and loops around the reserve.

The slowly winds up the hillside and crosses over the main road that loops around the reserve. On the walk visitors will come across a bench that they can rest on while they take in the spectacular mountain views.

After taking in the views of the Gibraltar Ranges there will be a short walk to the Church Rock. Diaries dating back to the 1800s indicate the bass of the rock was the meeting point for children to receive religious lessons. There is also evidence the local Aboriginal people used this rock as meeting place.

=== Sanctuary Loop ===
The Sanctuary Loop allows visitors at Tidbinbilla to be up close and personal with a range of native animals in their natural habitat. The 2.5 km loop is easy and flat walk with well signposted with information about the local history and the native flora and fauna. The wheelchair accessible and child friendly pathway winds through a series of interconnected habitats.

In the Sanctuary visitors will be able to get close to Brush-tailed Rock-wallabies, platypus, echidnas, birds, and other animals in their natural habitats. While they are interesting to look at it is important that visitors do not touch or disturb these wild animals.

=== Gibraltar Peak ===
This moderate to hard level walking trail is 8.2 km long and will take approximately 2–3 hours to complete. Starting at Dalsetta the trail passes through open grassland before it climbs to Eliza Saddle. After taking a short break at the picnic table here continue up the steep climb through rugged bushland to the Gibraltar Peak viewpoint.

As visitors ascend the boulders of the viewpoint they are able to take in 360-degree views of Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve, Canberra and Black Mountain Tower.

<doc id="102065" wikidata="Q840625" url="?curid=102065" title="Shibboleth">
<text>A shibboleth (; ) is any custom or tradition, usually a choice of phrasing or single word, that distinguishes one group of people from another. Historically, shibboleths have been used as passwords, ways of self-identification, signals of loyalty and affinity, ways of maintaining traditional segregation, or protection from real or perceived threats.

==Origin==
The term originates from the Hebrew word (), which means the part of a plant containing grain, such as the ear of a stalk of wheat or rye; or less commonly (but arguably more appropriately) &#x27;flood, torrent&#x27;.

===Biblical account===
The modern use derives from an account in the Hebrew Bible, in which pronunciation of this word was used to distinguish Ephraimites, whose dialect used a different first consonant. The difference concerns the Hebrew letter &quot;shin&quot;, which is now pronounced as (as in &quot;shoe&quot;). In the Book of Judges chapter 12, after the inhabitants of Gilead under the command of Jephthah inflicted a military defeat upon the invading tribe of Ephraim (around 1370–1070 BC), the surviving Ephraimites tried to cross the river Jordan back into their home territory, but the Gileadites secured the river&#x27;s fords to stop them. To identify and kill these Ephraimites, the Gileadites told each suspected survivor to say the word &quot;shibboleth&quot;. The Ephraimite dialect resulted in a pronunciation that, to Gileadites, sounded like &quot;sibboleth&quot;. In Judges 12:5–6 in the King James Bible, the anecdote appears thus (with the word already in its current English spelling):
===Phonetics of the biblical test===
&quot;Shibboleth&quot; has been described as the first &quot;password&quot; in Western literature but exactly how it worked is not known; it has long been debated by scholars of Semitic languages. It may have been quite subtle: the men of Ephraim were unlikely to be &quot;caught totally napping by any test that involved some gross and readily detectable difference of pronunciation&quot;; On a superficial reading the fleeing Ephraimites were betrayed by their dialect: they said &quot;sibbōleth&quot;. But it has been asked why they did not simply repeat what the Gileadite sentries told them to say — &quot;they surely would have used the required sound to save their necks&quot;, since peoples in the region could say both &quot;sh&quot; and &quot;s&quot;. &quot;We have yet to learn how the suspects were caught by the catchword&quot;. A related problem (akin to false positives) is how the test spared neutral tribes with whom the Gileadite guards had no quarrel, yet pinpointed the Ephraimite enemy.
Ephraim Avigdor Speiser therefore proposed that the test involved a more challenging sound than could be written down in the later biblical Hebrew narrative, namely the phoneme (≈ English &quot;th&quot;). Present in archaic Hebrew (said Speiser) but later lost in most dialects, the Gileadites, who lived across a dialect boundary (the river Jordan), had retained it in theirs. Thus, what the Gileadite guards would have demanded was the password &quot;thibbōlet&quot;. The phoneme is difficult for naive users — to this day, wrote Speiser, most non-Arab Muslims cannot pronounce the classical Arabic equivalent — hence the best the Ephraimite refugees could manage was &quot;sibbōlet&quot;. Speiser&#x27;s solution has had a mixed reception, but has been revived by Gary A. Rendsburg.

John Emerton argued that &quot;Perhaps [the Ephraimites] could pronounce &quot;š&quot;, but they articulated the consonant in a different way from the Gileadites, and their pronunciation sounded to the men of Gilead like &quot;s&quot;&quot;. There is a range of ways of pronouncing the two phonemes. &quot;An old clergyman of my acquaintance used to say &#x27;O Lord, save the Queen&#x27; in such a way that it sounded [to me] like &#x27;O Lord, shave the Queen&#x27;&quot;, and analogies could be found amongst Hebrew users in modern Lithuania and Morocco. Berkeley scholar Ronald Hendel agreed, saying the theory was supported by a document recently dug up near modern Amman. It tended to show that, across the Jordan, the pronunciation of the phoneme &quot;sh&quot; was heard as &quot;s&quot; by Hebrew speakers from the opposite side of the river. &quot;This is why Gileadite &quot;šibbōlet&quot; is repeated by the Ephraimites as &quot;sibbōlet&quot;: they simply repeated the word as they heard it&quot;. Other solutions have been proposed.

David Marcus has contended that linguistic scholars have missed the point of the biblical anecdote: The purpose of the later Judean narrator was not to record some phonetic detail, but to satirise the incompetence of &quot;the high and mighty northern Ephraimites&quot;. &quot;The shibboleth episode ridicules the Ephraimites who are portrayed as incompetent nincompoops who cannot even repeat a test-word spoken by the Gileadite guards&quot;.

==Modern use==
In modern English, a shibboleth can have a sociological meaning, referring to any in-group word or phrase that can distinguish members from outsiders. It is also sometimes used in a broader sense to mean jargon, the proper use of which identifies speakers as members of a particular group or subculture.

In information technology, Shibboleth is a community-wide password that enables members of that community to access an online resource without revealing their individual identities. The origin server can vouch for the identity of the individual user without giving the target server any further identifying information. Hence the individual user does not know the password that is actually employed – it is generated internally by the origin server – and so cannot betray it to outsiders.

The term can also be used pejoratively, suggesting that the original meaning of a symbol has in effect been lost and that the symbol now serves merely to identify allegiance, being described as &quot;nothing more than a shibboleth&quot;. In 1956, economist Paul Samuelson applied the term &quot;shibboleth&quot; in works including &quot;Foundations of Economic Analysis&quot; to mean an idea for which &quot;the means becomes the end, and the letter of the law takes precedence over the spirit.&quot; Samuelson admitted that &quot;shibboleth&quot; is an imperfect term for this phenomenon.

==Examples==
Shibboleths have been used by different subcultures throughout the world at different times. Regional differences, level of expertise, and computer coding techniques are several forms that shibboleths have taken.

There is a legend that before the Battle of the Golden Spurs in May 1302, the Flemish slaughtered every Frenchman they could find in the city of Bruges, an act known as the Matins of Bruges. They identified Frenchmen based on their inability to pronounce the Flemish phrase , &#x27;shield and friend&#x27;, or possibly , &#x27;friend of the Guilds&#x27;. However, many Medieval Flemish dialects did not contain the cluster &quot;sch-&quot; either (even today&#x27;s Kortrijk dialect has &quot;sk-&quot;), and Medieval French rolled the r just as Flemish did.

There is an anecdote in Sicily that, during the rebellion of the Sicilian Vespers in 1282, the inhabitants of the island killed the French occupiers who, when questioned, could not correctly pronounce the Sicilian word &#x27;chickpeas&#x27;.

Following Mayor Albert&#x27;s Rebellion in 1312 Kraków, Poles used the Polish language shibboleth &quot;Soczewica, koło, miele, młyn&quot; (&#x27;Lentil, wheel, grinds (verb), mill&#x27;) to distinguish the German-speaking burghers. Those who could not properly pronounce this phrase were executed.
 (&#x27;Butter, rye bread and green cheese, whoever cannot say that is not a genuine Frisian&#x27;) was a phrase used by the Frisian Pier Gerlofs Donia during a Frisian rebellion (1515–1523). Ships whose crew could not pronounce this properly were usually plundered and soldiers who could not were beheaded by Donia.

Newspaper advertisements in 18th-century America seeking absconding servants or apprentices frequently used the shibboleth method to identify them. Since most runaways were from the British Isles originally, they were identified by their distinctive regional accents, e.g. &quot;speaks broad Yorkshire&quot;. Studying a large number of these advertisements, Allen Walker Read noticed an exception: runaways were never advertised as having London or eastern counties accents. From this he inferred that their speech did not differ from the bulk of the American population. &quot;Thus in the colonial period American English had a consistency of its own, most closely approximating the type of the region around London&quot;.
In Japan during the 1923 Kantō Massacre, in which ethnic Koreans in Japan were hunted down and killed by vigilantes after rumors spread that they were committing crimes, shibboleths were attested to having been used to identify Koreans. The Japanese poet Shigeji Tsuboi wrote that he overheard vigilantes asking people to pronounce the phrase &quot;jūgoen gojissen&quot; (). If the person pronounced it as &quot;chūkoen kochissen&quot;, he was reportedly dragged away for punishment. Both Korean and Japanese people recalled similar shibboleths being used, including &quot;ichien gojissen&quot; (). Other strings attested to were &quot;ga-gi-gu-ge-go&quot; () and &quot;ka-ki-ku-ke-ko&quot; (), which were thought difficult for Koreans to pronounce.

In October 1937, the Spanish word for parsley, , was used as a shibboleth to identify Haitian immigrants living along the border in the Dominican Republic. The Dominican dictator, Rafael Trujillo, ordered the execution of these people. It is alleged that between 20,000 and 30,000 individuals were murdered within a few days in the Parsley Massacre, although more recent scholarship and the lack of evidence such as mass graves puts the actual estimate closer to between 1,000 and 12,168.

During the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, the Dutch used the name of the seaside town of Scheveningen as a shibboleth to tell Germans from Dutch (&quot;Sch&quot; in Dutch is analyzed as the letter &quot;s&quot; combined with the digraph &quot;ch&quot;, producing the consonant cluster , while in German &quot;Sch&quot; is read as the trigraph &quot;sch&quot;, pronounced , closer to &quot;sh&quot; sound in English).

Some American soldiers in the Pacific theater in World War II used the word &quot;&quot; as a shibboleth to challenge unidentified persons, on the premise that Japanese people would often pronounce both letters L and R as rolled Rs. In Oliver Gramling&#x27;s &quot;Free Men Are Fighting: The Story of World War II&quot; (1942) the author notes that, in the war, Japanese spies would often approach checkpoints posing as American or Filipino military personnel. A shibboleth such as &quot;lollapalooza&quot; would be used by the sentry, who, if the first two syllables come back as &quot;rorra,&quot; would &quot;open fire without waiting to hear the remainder&quot;. Another sign/countersign used by the Allied forces: the challenge/sign was &quot;flash&quot;, the password &quot;thunder&quot;, and the countersign &quot;Welcome&quot;. This was used during D-Day during World War II due to the rarity of the voiceless dental fricative (th-sound) and voiced labial–velar approximant (w-sound) in German.

During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, use of the name Derry or Londonderry for the province&#x27;s second-largest city was often taken as an indication of the speaker&#x27;s political stance, and as such frequently implied more than simply naming the location. The pronunciation of the name of the letter H is a related shibboleth, with Catholics pronouncing it as &quot;haitch&quot; and Protestants often pronouncing the letter differently.

During the Black July riots of Sri Lanka in 1983, many Tamils were massacred by Sinhalese youths. In many cases these massacres took the form of boarding buses and getting the passengers to pronounce words that had at the beginning (like &#x27;bucket&#x27;) and executing the people who found it difficult.

In Australia and New Zealand, the words &quot;fish and chips&quot; are often used to highlight the difference in each country&#x27;s short-i vowel sound [ɪ] and asking someone to say the phrase can identify which country they are from. Australian English has a higher forward sound [i], close to the y in happy and city, while New Zealand English has a lower backward sound [ɘ], a slightly higher version of the a in about and comma. Thus, New Zealanders hear Australians say &quot;feesh and cheeps&quot;, while Australians hear New Zealanders say &quot;fush and chups&quot;. A long drawn out pronunciation of the names of the cities Brisbane and Melbourne rather than the typically Australian rapid &quot;bun&quot; ending is a common way for someone to be exposed as new to the country. Within Australia, what someone calls &quot;devon&quot;, or how he names the size of beer he orders can often pinpoint what state he is from, as both of these have varied names across the country.

In Canada, the name of Canada&#x27;s second largest city, Montreal, is pronounced by English-speaking locals. This contrasts with the typical American pronunciation of the city as .

In the United States, the name of the state Nevada comes from the Spanish , meaning &#x27;snow-covered&#x27;. Nevadans pronounce the second syllable with the &quot;a&quot; as in &quot;trap&quot; () while some people from outside of the state can pronounce it with the &quot;a&quot; as in &quot;palm&quot; (). Although many Americans interpret the latter back vowel as being closer to the Spanish pronunciation, it is not the pronunciation used by Nevadans. Likewise, the same test can be used to identify someone unfamiliar with southwest Missouri, as the city of Nevada, Missouri is pronounced with the &quot;a&quot; as in &quot;cape&quot; ().

During the Russo-Ukrainian War (2014–present), Ukrainians have used the word (a type of Ukrainian bread) to distinguish between Ukrainians and Russians.

==Furtive shibboleths==
A &quot;furtive shibboleth&quot; is a type of a shibboleth that identifies individuals as being part of a group, not based on their ability to pronounce one or more words, but on their ability to recognize a seemingly innocuous phrase as a secret message. For example, members of Alcoholics Anonymous sometimes refer to themselves as &quot;a friend of Bill W.&quot;, which is a reference to AA&#x27;s founder, William Griffith Wilson. To the uninitiated, this would seem like a casual – if off-topic – remark, but other AA members would understand its meaning.

Similarly, during World War II, a homosexual US sailor might call himself a &quot;friend of Dorothy&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek acknowledgment of a stereotypical affinity for Judy Garland in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. This code was so effective that the Naval Investigative Service, upon learning that the phrase was a way for gay sailors to identify each other, undertook a search for this &quot;Dorothy&quot;, whom they believed to be an actual woman with connections to homosexual servicemen in the Chicago area. Many cruise lines still host &quot;Friends of Dorothy&quot; meetings for LGBT guests to gather.

Likewise, homosexuals in Britain might use the cant language Polari.

Mark Twain used an explicit shibboleth to conceal a furtive shibboleth. In &quot;The Innocents Abroad&quot; he told the Shibboleth story in seemingly &quot;inept and uninteresting&quot; detail. To the initiated, however, the wording revealed that Twain was a freemason.

&quot;Fourteen Words&quot;, &quot;14&quot;, or &quot;14/88&quot; are furtive shibboleths used among white supremacists in the Anglosphere.

==In art==

Colombian conceptual artist Doris Salcedo created a work titled &quot;Shibboleth&quot; at Tate Modern, London, in 2007–2008. The piece consisted of a 548-foot-long crack that bisected the floor of the Tate&#x27;s lobby space.

Salcedo said of the work:

<doc id="102067" wikidata="Q1319206" url="?curid=102067" title="Hojōjutsu">
<text>or or just , is the traditional Japanese martial art of restraining a person using cord or rope (called in Japanese), as a precursor to modern-day handcuffs. Encompassing many different materials, techniques and methods from many different schools, Hojōjutsu is a quintessentially Japanese art that is a unique product of Japanese history and culture.

As a martial arts practice, Hojōjutsu is seldom if ever taught on its own but as part of a curriculum under the aegis of the body of study encompassed by a larger school of bugei or budō, often as an advanced study in jujutsu. Regardless of the source, Hojōjutsu techniques and methods are seldom demonstrated outside Japan.

==Techniques and methods==
Generally speaking, Hojōjutsu can be divided into two broad categories. The first is the capture and restraint of a prisoner that was effected with strong, thin cord (usually 3–4 millimeters in diameter) called a , and sometimes the sageo carried by samurai on the sword-sheaths was used. In law-enforcement, this cord was carried by constables who secreted the rope in a small bundle that fed cord from one end. This &quot;torinawa&quot; (&quot;capture-rope&quot;) was coiled so that the cord would pay out from one end as the bundled cord was passed around the prisoner&#x27;s body, neck and arms as he or she was tied. This was usually accomplished by one constable in the course of performing an arrest while the prisoner was actively resisting and had to be accomplished quickly.

Even at this stage, attention was still paid to visual and aesthetic concerns in the tying method as well as to the cultural needs of Japanese society. According to experts, an accused but not convicted prisoner would be tied using methods which allowed the prisoner to be securely restrained but which contained no knots to save the prisoner the shame of being publicly bound. Instead of securing the tie with knots, the constable held on to the free end of the rope and walked behind the prisoner to keep him or her under control as the prisoner was taken for an interrogation which could involve the application of one or more forms of judicial torture to elicit a confession.

The second category utilized with one or occasionally two “main ropes” or “honnawa” which, like the hayanawa, could be any one of many different lengths, but was usually hemp in material. The thickness of this rope averaged at six or more millimeters in diameter, while the length could be as much as 25 meters long. This was used to provide a more secure, long-term binding than is possible with the hayanawa for transportation to a place of incarceration, restraint at legal proceedings, and—in the case of particularly severe crimes—for the public display of the prisoner prior to execution by such methods as beheading, crucifixion (i.e., the prisoner was displayed tied to a cross before spears were driven through the body), or, in arson convictions, death by fire.

Honnawa ties were applied by a group of people, usually not less than four, whose presence allowed the use of more intricate and ornate patterns than was the case with the hayanawa. Both forms combined effective restraint with a distinct visual aesthetic.

In either form, the Hojōjutsu ties known today display a shrewd understanding of human anatomy through several recurrent themes. This can include leverage-removal (tying limbs in positions that decrease the force they can generate), rope-placement to discourage struggling or to make it less effective by placing one or more loops of rope around the neck and constricting restraint around points on the upper arms where determined struggle put pressure on blood vessels and nerves numbing the extremities.

==Persistence in modern times==
Hojōjutsu shows limited survival in the modern world, both in Japan and elsewhere. Torinawa techniques are taught as part of the curriculum learned by modern Japanese police officers and it remains an advanced topic within schools of jujutsu, following it and other Japanese traditional martial arts as they make their way around the world from Brazil to Eastern Europe. Yoshida ha Shidare Yanagi ryu, art of the late Don Angier, contains an extensive hojōjutsu curriculum.

Although the Honnawa techniques have long been supplanted by handcuffs and leg-irons, some teachers of traditional martial arts in Japan work to continue to maintain the art form. The Soke (head of, and heir to the style) of Masaki-ryu Bujutsu, Nawa Yumio, has written several books on the subject and has worked as an historical consultant on matters dealing with law-enforcement and Mizukoshi Hiro&#x27;s recently reprinted book &quot;Torinawajutsu&quot; offers historical background followed by thorough, practical instruction in more than 25 traditional ties including some recreated from rare and very old texts. The Koryu cited are Seigo Ryu Jujutsu, Seishin Ryu Jujutsu, Koden Enshin Ryu Iaijutsu, Nanbu Handen Hojo Jutsu, Kurokawa Ryu Ninjutsu, Kurama Yoshin Ryu Jujutsu, Nagano Ryu Heihou, Mitsuo (Mippa) Muteki Ryu, Bo Ryu and Tenfu Muso Ryu.

That is the late Seiko Fujita’s monumental work, &quot;Zukai Torinawajutsu&quot;, which could be considered as the encyclopedia of this art, by showing hundreds of ties from many different schools.

<text>Segeberg (; ) is a district in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is bounded by (from the southwest and clockwise) the districts of Pinneberg, Steinburg and Rendsburg-Eckernförde, the city of Neumünster, the districts of Plön, Ostholstein and Stormarn, and the city state of Hamburg.

==History==
The history of the district is connected to the history of Holstein. In 1134, the castle of Segeberg was erected as a regional centre from where the reeve of Segeberg ruled. When Schleswig-Holstein became a Prussian province in 1865, the Prussian administration established the district of Segeberg.

Since then, the district has grown considerably twice: In 1932 parts of the dissolved district of Bordesholm joined the district; in 1970 the city of Norderstedt became part of the district.

==Geography==
The district of Segeberg consists of the agricultural plains between the cities of Neumünster and Hamburg. A southwestern portion of the hilly lakeland called &quot;Holsteinische Schweiz&quot; (Holsatian Switzerland) belongs to the district, as well as some northern suburbs of Hamburg.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* four steeples forming a cross, commemorating the missionary activities of bishop Vizelin of Segeberg who Christianised Holstein in the early Middle Ages
* the heraldic nettle leaf of Holstein in the middle of the cross
* four green water lily leaves from the arms of Segeberg&#x27;s reeves

<text>Oss () is a municipality and a city in the southern Netherlands, in the province of North Brabant, situated between Nijmegen and &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch.

== Population centres ==
== Topography ==
&quot;Dutch Topographic map of Oss (municipality), June 2015&quot;

== City center of Oss ==
Oss has a shopping center with many squares, however, the only real shopping streets (also the best known) are the Heuvelstraat, Walstraat and the Peperstraat. The squares are connected with these shopping streets and passages that contain shops. One of the passages (The Passage, Dutch: de Passage, Local Dialect: &#x27;t Gengske) had an overhauling renovation in 2014. It now resembles an old Dutch street.

=== The city of Oss ===
There is archaeological evidence that humans have lived in and around Oss for 4,000 years. Major archaeological finds were the Vorstengraf burial sites and the indigenous-Roman burial fields of Oss-Ussen.

Oss was first mentioned in a letter by Pope Alexander II on 6 May 1069.
Oss was granted city rights in 1399 by Hertogin (Duchess) Johanna van Brabant. Present-day Oss has several chemical and pharmaceutical industries like Merck &amp; Co. (previously Schering-Plough, Organon and Diosynth).
Oss is also host to the professional football team TOP Oss, and is the birthplace of former Manchester United and Real Madrid star Ruud van Nistelrooy, although he did not play for the local side, but for rivals FC Den Bosch.

The gothic metal/alternative rock band The Gathering, formed in 1989, originally hails from Oss.

=== Berghem ===

Berghem is a small town east of Oss (population: 6,900). Berghem is currently being expanded with many new houses in the Piekenhoef.

=== Megen ===

Megen is a small city (population: 1,686) close to the river Maas.

Megen used to be the &#x27;capital&#x27; of the county Megen (including Haren, Macharen and Teeffelen) that was founded around 1145. City rights were obtained in 1357.
In 1810, the County Megen became a municipality to which Haren and Macharen also belonged. It became part of the municipality of Oss in 1994.

Currently, there are two monasteries in Megen. One is inhabited by the Clarissas (also called the Poor Clares), followers of St. Clare of Assisi. The other is occupied by the Franciscans, followers of St. Francis of Assisi. Of the two castles Megen used to have, only one tower remains.

=== Ravenstein ===

Ravenstein (population: 3,728) is a city and was a municipality until 2003, when it was added to the Oss municipality. The municipality covered an area of 42.68 km² and also included villages: Demen, Dennenburg, Deursen, Dieden, Herpen, Huisseling, Keent, Koolwijk, Neerlangel, Neerloon, Overlangel.

Ravenstein received city rights in 1380.

<text>Helmond (; called &quot;Héllemond&quot; in the local dialect) is a city and municipality in the Metropoolregio Eindhoven of the province of North Brabant in the Southern Netherlands.

Helmond is home to several textile and metal companies. The Vlisco factory is located next to the Zuid-Willemsvaart canal, which runs through the city.

The spoken language is Helmonds (an East Brabantian dialect).

== History ==
=== Etymology and coat of arms ===
Helmond&#x27;s coat of arms, first appearing in 1241, displays a helmet, and is a canting arms for the city&#x27;s name, as &quot;helm&quot; means helmet in Dutch. However, the actual etymology of Helmond&#x27;s name is probably derived from the combination of &quot;Hel&quot;, which means &quot;low-lying&quot; (from Proto-Germanic &quot;*haljæ&quot; / &quot;Hel&quot;), and &quot;Mond&quot;, which referred to higher ground or a secure place.

The helmet on the coat of arms originally was depicted as a medieval great helm, however, the design eventually came to depict a jousting helmet. The oak sprigs symbolize freedom, while the bird perched on them is thought to be purely decorative.

=== Medieval and early modern periods ===
During the Merovingian period, the site of what is now Helmond was an only partially habitable convergence of streams. As the streams began to silt over, settlement was made possible, and by the year 1000, a settlement arose west of what is the current city center. Additionally, a precursor to the current Helmond Castle, named &quot;&#x27;t Oude Huys&quot; (&quot;the old house&quot;), was built around this time. Documents from 1108 mention Lord Hazelo von Helmond, the first feudal lord of the allodium of Helmond.

In 1179, a bull of Pope Alexander III mentions Helmond being donated to the Abbey of Floreffe. At this point, the local feudal administration was probably moved to t&#x27; Oude Huys. In 1220, Helmond came under the control of Henry I of Brabant. In 1225, the town was founded by Henry, it received its Town Privileges in 1232. Following his death in 1235, it was passed down to his daughter, Maria of Brabant, Holy Roman Empress, who spent much time at t&#x27; Oude Huys and whose founding of Binderen Abbey benefited the growth of the city. Upon her death in 1260, the town passed back to the Dukes of Brabant, who, in 1315, leased it to the van Berlaer family. In 1325, Jan II Berthout van Berlaer started the construction of a stone keep on the site of the current Helmond Castle, supplanting t&#x27; Oude Huys. By 1400, the city ramparts were built.

Having gained market rights in 1376, Helmond&#x27;s textile industry began to develop, and in 1389, seven guilds were authorized to operate in the town. Merchants from Helmond sold wool and textiles throughout Brabant. Despite the commercial growth, the town&#x27;s population remained small. Helmond&#x27;s prosperity soon ended due to war and instability in the Duchy of Guelders, and following Charles V&#x27;s ascension to the Duchy of Brabant, Helmond was put under siege and sacked by the army of Maarten van Rossum in 1543.

=== Under the Dutch Republic and the Revolutionary era ===
Helmond was also embroiled in the Eighty Years War. Since it remained loyal to Philip II of Spain, the army of the Dutch Republic twice captured and lost the city, with only the castle remaining uncaptured. The effects of the war and a plague outbreak in 1636 decimated the textile industry in Helmond, and many weavers fled to Haarlem. Only with the peace of 1648 could the city start to recover. The weavers of Helmond gained a fruitful partnership with merchants in Haarlem, and the city could rebuild from the war. Catholics were pushed underground. Although the city recovered its prosperity, it was once again plunged into instability during the &quot;Patriottentijd&quot; of the late 18th century. Following several skirmishes and political maneuvers in the city, the Patriots were crushed through the intervention of Prussia in 1787, but only five years later in 1793, the French Republic invaded. The liberal French administration allowed the Patriots to re-assert themselves in the city, and in 1795, universal male suffrage came to Helmond. By 1798, the vestiges of the Dutch Republic were abolished, and Catholics were once again allowed to take part in city governance. 

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===
By the late 18th and early 19th century, local entrepreneurs also started to grow the textile business unassisted by the Haarlem merchants, facilitating industrial production. It became a city with a seat in the Estates of Brabant in 1814. The 1826 opening of the Zuid-Willemsvaart canal, which runs through the city, brought more prosperity to the city. In addition to the weaving mills and the associated yarn dyeing and bleaching plants, other branches of the textile industry also developed, such as cotton printing. 

The introduction of steam power and construction of a railway station in 1866 greatly accelerated the development of Helmond, and its population greatly increased. By the early 20th century, industry in Helmond started to branch out from textiles: metal products, such as machines and wires, were produced in the city, along with a cocoa factory, a margarine factory, and the grocery chain EDAH.

In 1940, Helmond was captured by the Wehrmacht, and its city administration was taken over by NSB collaborators. The city was liberated by the British Army on 24 and 25 September 1944.

After the war, industry once again flourished, with new companies establishing themselves in the city while old industries continued. Pursuing a modern image, prominent projects such as the Cube Houses were built. Helmond gained its 80,000th resident in 1999, and continues to grow.

<doc id="102075" wikidata="Q1415635" url="?curid=102075" title="Sweatshop">
<text>A sweatshop or sweat factory is a crowded workplace with very poor or illegal working conditions, including little to no breaks, inadequate work space, insufficient lighting and ventilation, or uncomfortably or dangerously high or low temperatures. The work may be difficult, tiresome, dangerous, climatically challenging, or underpaid. Employees in sweatshops may work long hours with unfair wages, regardless of laws mandating overtime pay or a minimum wage; child labor laws may also be violated. Women make up 85 to 90% of sweatshop workers and may be forced by employers to take birth control and routine pregnancy tests to avoid supporting maternity leave or providing health benefits. 

The Fair Labor Association&#x27;s &quot;2006 Annual Public Report&quot; inspected factories for FLA compliance in 18 countries including Bangladesh, El Salvador, Colombia, Guatemala, Malaysia, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, China, India, Vietnam, Honduras, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, and the United States. The U.S. Department of Labor&#x27;s &quot;2015 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor&quot; found that &quot;18 countries did not meet the International Labour Organization&#x27;s recommendation for an adequate number of inspectors.&quot;

==Use of the term==
The phrase sweatshop was coined in 1850, meaning a factory or workshop where workers are treated unfairly, for example, by having low wages, working long hours, and living in poor conditions. Since 1850, immigrants flocked to work at sweatshops in cities like London, New York, and Paris for over a century. Many of them worked in tiny, stuffy rooms that were prone to fire hazards and rat infestations. The term sweatshop was used in Charles Kingsley&#x27;s &quot;Cheap Clothes and Nasty&quot; (1850) describing how such workplaces create a ‘sweating system’ of workers. The idea of minimum wage and labour unions was not developed until the 1890s. This issue appears to be solved by some anti-sweatshop organizations. However, the phrase is still used because sweatshops are still common in countries around the world.

==History==
===19th and early 20th centuries===

Many workplaces through history have been crowded, low-paying, and without job security; but the concept of a sweatshop originated between 1830 and 1850 as a specific type of workshop in which a certain type of middleman, the sweater, directed others in garment making (the process of producing clothing) under arduous conditions. The terms &quot;sweater&quot; for the middleman and &quot;sweat system&quot; for the process of subcontracting piecework were used in early critiques like Charles Kingsley&#x27;s &quot;Cheap Clothes and Nasty&quot;, written in 1850, which described conditions in London, England. The workplaces created for the sweating system (a system of subcontracting in the tailoring trade) were called &quot;sweatshops&quot; and might contain only a few workers or as many as 300 or more. All those workers were illegally underpaid in terms of regular time and even overtime. 

Between 1832 and 1850, sweatshops attracted individuals with lower incomes to growing cities, and attracted immigrants to locations such as London and New York City&#x27;s garment district, located near the tenements of New York&#x27;s Lower East Side. These sweatshops incurred criticism: labor leaders cited them as crowded, poorly ventilated, and prone to fires and rodent infestations: in many cases, there were many workers crowded into small tenement rooms.

In the 1890s, the National Anti-Sweating League was formed in Melbourne and campaigned successfully for a minimum wage via trade boards. A group with the same name campaigned from 1906 in the UK, resulting in the Trade Boards Act 1909.

In 1910, the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union was founded in attempt to improve the condition of these workers.

Criticism of garment sweatshops became a major force behind workplace safety regulations and labor laws. As some journalists strove to change working conditions, the term &quot;sweatshop&quot; came to refer to a broader set of workplaces whose conditions were considered inferior. In the United States, investigative journalists, known as muckrakers, wrote exposés of business practices, and progressive politicians campaigned for new laws. Notable exposés of sweatshop conditions include Jacob Riis&#x27; photo documentary &quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot; and Upton Sinclair&#x27;s book, &quot;The Jungle&quot;, a fictionalized account of the meat packing industry.

In 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire galvanized negative public perceptions of sweatshops in New York City. The pivotal role of this event is chronicled at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, part of the Lower East Side Tenement National Historic Site. While trade unions, minimum wage laws, fire safety codes, and labour laws have made sweatshops (in the original sense) rarer in the developed world, they did not eliminate them, and the term is increasingly associated with factories in the developing world.

===Late 20th century to present===

In 1994, the United States Government Accountability Office reported that there were still thousands of sweatshops in the United States, using a definition of a &quot;sweatshop&quot; as any &quot;employer that violates more than one federal or state labor law governing minimum wage and overtime, child labor, industrial homework, occupational safety and health, workers&#x27; compensation, or industry registration&quot;. This recent definition eliminates any historical distinction about the role of a middleman or the items produced and focuses on the legal standards of developed country workplaces. An area of controversy between supporters of outsourcing production to the Third World and the anti-sweatshop movement is whether such standards can or should be applied to the workplaces of the developing world.

Sweatshops are also sometimes implicated in human trafficking when workers have been tricked into starting work without informed consent, or when workers are kept at work through debt bondage or mental duress, all of which are more likely if the workforce is drawn from children or the uneducated rural poor. Because they often exist in places without effective workplace safety or environmental laws, sweatshops sometimes injure their workers or the environment at greater rates than would be acceptable in developed countries. Penal labor facilities (employing prisoners) may be grouped under the sweatshop label due to underpaid work conditions. 

Sweatshop conditions resemble prison labor in many cases, especially from a commonly found Western perspective. In 2014 Apple was caught &quot;failing to protect its workers&quot; in one of its Pegatron factories. Overwhelmed workers were caught falling asleep during their 12-hour shifts and an undercover reporter had to work 18 days in a row. Sweatshops in question carry characteristics such as compulsory pregnancy tests for female laborers and terrorization from supervisors into submission. Workers then go into a state of forced labor, and if even one day of work is not accounted for they could be immediately fired. These working conditions have been the source of suicidal unrest within factories in the past. Chinese sweatshops known to have increased numbers of suicidal employees have suicide nets covering the whole site, in place to stop overworked and stressed employees from leaping to their deaths, such as in the case of the Foxconn suicides.

Recently, Boohoo came under light since auditors uncovered a large chain of factories in Leicester producing clothes for Boohoo that were only paying their workers between £3-4. The conditions of the factories were described as terrible and workers received &quot;illegally low pay&quot;.

==Industries using sweatshop labor==
World-famous fashion brands such as H&amp;M, Nike, Adidas and Uniqlo have all been criticized for their use of sweatshops. In 2015, anti-sweatshop protesters marched against the Japanese fast-fashion brand Uniqlo in Hong Kong. Along with the Japanese anti-sweatshops organisation , the Hong Kong labour organisation SACOM (Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour) protested the &quot;harsh and dangerous&quot; working conditions in Uniqlo&#x27;s value-added factories in China. According to a recent report published by SACOM, Uniqlo’s suppliers were blamed for &quot;systematically underpaying their labour, forcing them to work excessive hours and subjecting them to unsafe working conditions, which included sewage-covered floors, poor ventilation, and sweltering temperatures&quot;. According to the 2016 Clean Clothes Campaign, H&amp;M strategic suppliers in Bangladesh were reported for dangerous working environments, which lacked vital equipment for workers and adequate fire exits.

The German sportswear giant Adidas was criticized for its Indonesian sweatshops in 2000, and accused of underpayment, overtime working, physical abuse and child labour. Another sportswear giant, Nike, faced a heavy wave of anti-sweatshop protests, organised by the United Students Against Sweatshops (USAS) and held in Boston, Washington D.C., Bangalore, and San Pedro Sula. They claimed that workers in Nike&#x27;s contract factory in Vietnam were suffering from wage theft, verbal abuse and harsh working conditions with &quot;temperatures over the legal limit of 90 degrees&quot;. Since the 1990s, Nike has been reported to employ sweat factories and child labour. Regardless of its effort to turn things around, Nike&#x27;s image has been affected by the issue during the past two decades. Nike established an independent department which aimed to improve workers’ livelihoods in 1996. It was renamed the Fair Labor Association in 1999, as a non-profit organisation which includes representatives from companies, human rights organizations, and labour unions to work on the monitoring and management of labour rights. To improve its brand image of being immoral, Nike has been publishing annual sustainable business reports since 2001 and annual corporate social responsibility reports continuously since 2005, mentioning its commitments, standards and audits. Similar stories have been common in the fashion industry over the past few decades. Brands such as Shein, Nike, H&amp;M, Zara, Disney, and Victoria&#x27;s Secret to name a few examples, are still using sweatshops. 

In 2016, the United States Department of Labor investigated 77 garment factories in Los Angeles that produced clothing for the aforementioned brands, and found labor violations at 85% of the factories it visited.

==Contributing factors==
===Fast fashion===

A trend called &quot;fast fashion&quot; is believed to contribute towards the rise of sweatshops. Fast fashion refers to &quot;rapid reorders and new orders that retailers now exert as they discern sales trends in real time&quot; (Ross, 2015) To keep up with the fast-changing trends and demands within the fashion industry, these fast-fashion brands have to react and arrange production accordingly. To lower production and storage costs, these brands outsource labour to other countries with low production costs which can produce orders in a short time. This may result in workers suffering from long working hours without reasonable payment. A documentary, &quot;The True Cost&quot; (2015), claims that sweatshops relieve pressure on retailers by passing it to factory owners and, ultimately, workers.

===Government corruption and inadequate labour protection legislation===
Government corruption and inadequate labour protection legislation in developing countries have also contributed to the suffering of their employees. Weak law enforcement has attracted outside investment in these developing countries, which is a serious problem generating sweatshops. Without reasonable law restrictions, outside investors can set up fashion manufacturing plants at a lower cost. According to Zamen (2012), governments in developing countries often fail to enforce safety standards in local factories because of corruption and weak law enforcement. These circumstances allow factories to provide dangerous working conditions for workers. According to the Corruption Perception Index 2016 (2017), those countries with a high risk of corruption such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Pakistan and China are reported to have larger numbers of unsafe garment factories operating inside the countries. When Zamen (2012) said &quot;corruption kills&quot;, sweatshops in developing countries would be the prime cases.

In some places the government or media do not show the full picture. An example of this may be seen in Dubai where some labour camps do not have proper conditions for workers. If they protest, they can be deported if they are foreigners.

===Low education level===
It is suggested that these workers should fight back and protect their labour rights, yet a lot of them in developing countries are ignorant about their rights because of their low education levels. According to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (2016), most of these sweatshops are located in countries that have low education levels. Harrison and Scorse mention that most of them do not know about their rights, such as matters about wages and supposed working conditions, thus they have no skill set to fight for their labour rights through collective bargaining (such as strikes or work to rule). Their lack of knowledge makes it hard for them to improve working conditions on their own.

===Artificial Intelligence===
The recent boom in Artificial Intelligence is a major contributor to the existence of sweatshops in the Global South. Workers in &quot;digital sweatshops&quot; differentiate images in videos to develop algorithms for automated driving, label images so AI can generate representations of politicians and celebrities, edit text to ensure language models like ChatGPT don&#x27;t produce poor answers. The workers in digital sweatshops are known as data workers- they categorize data to train AI systems. These digital sweatshops are often internet cafes, small office spaces, or homes full of many workers performing these repetitive tasks.

More than 2 million people in the Philippines perform this type of work supporting AI systems. [2] The platform Remotasks, owned by Scale AI, employs at least 10,000 workers in the Philippines. Workers are paid at extremely low rates, routinely delayed or withheld payments, and provided few channels for workers to seek recourse. Wages for these Filipino workers are far below the average Philippine minimum wages.

Ethical AI also requires human workers to filter and sort images. Sama, an &quot;ethical AI&quot; company outsourced work to Kenya where workers were tasked to watch videos of murdeers, rapes, suicides, and child sexual abuse. Sama employees in Nairobi work as outsourced Facebook content moderators- they view and remove illegal or banned content from Facebook. The workers in this particular office are among the lowest-paid workers for Facebook earning as little as $1.50 an hour.

Data workers face barriers to redressing some labor issues in the AI industry. Because AI seems automated, few people imagine the human labor it takes to produce the automated results. The Fairwork project evaluates companies against the principles of decent work and gives every company a score out of 10.

==Impacts of sweatshops==
===Child labour===

Child labour is one of the most serious impacts that sweatshops have brought. According to the International Labour Office, more than 250 million children are employed in sweatshops, of which 170 million are engaged in the textile industry in developing countries. In hopes of earning a living, many girls in these countries, such as Bangladesh and India, are willing to work at low wages for long working hours, said Sofie Ovaa, an officer of Stop Child Labour. Most fashion manufacturing chains employ low-skilled labour and as child laborers are easier to manage and even more suitable than adult labour for certain jobs such as cotton picking, it becomes a particular problem in sweatshops as they are vulnerable with no backups.

In the United States, sweatshops supporting the cotton textile industry were a contentious topic in American economic and political debate surrounding the use of child labor. In his book &quot;Child Labor: An American History&quot;, Hugh D. Hindman stated, &quot;In 1870, when New England dominated textiles, 13,767, or 14.5 percent of its workforce was children under sixteen&quot;. By the most conservative estimate, from the Census of Manufacturers, there were 27,538 under sixteen in southern mills. According to the household census in 1900, the number was 60,000. To curb this matter, the United States enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to prohibit the employment of minors under the age of sixteen.

===Environmental pollution===
Not only workers are impacted by sweatshops, but the neighboring environment as well, through lax environmental laws set up in developing countries to help reduce the production cost of the fashion industry. Clothing manufacturing is still one of the most polluting industries in the world. Nevertheless, the environment of developing countries remained deeply polluted by untreated waste. The Buriganga River in Bangladesh is now black and pronounced biologically dead because neighbouring leather tanneries are discharging more than 150 cubics of liquid waste daily. (Stanko, 2013) The daily life of local people is significantly affected as the Buriganga River is their source of bathing, irrigation and transportation. Many workers in the tanneries suffer from serious skin illnesses since they are exposed to toxic chemicals for a long time. Air is being highly polluted in such areas because the factories do not install proper ventilation facilities. Sweatshops are also an environmental issue as it is not only the human right of labour but also their living environment.

==Anti-sweatshop movement==
===History===
====19th and early 20th centuries====

Some of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th-century abolitionist movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel slavery, and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the Factory Act 1833) was passed in the United Kingdom several years after the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) was made illegal.

Ultimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common causes with trade unions Marxists and socialist political groups, or progressive movement and the muckrakers. Others focused on the continued slave trade and involuntary servitude in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the League of Nations and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery – human trafficking.

Those focused on working conditions included Friedrich Engels, whose book &quot;The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844&quot; would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, Karl Marx. In the United Kingdom, the first effective Factory Act was introduced in 1833 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor; but this applied only to textile factories. Later Acts extended protection to factories in other industries, but not until 1867 was there any similar protection for employees in small workshops, and not until 1891 was it possible to effectively enforce the legislation where the workplace was a dwelling (as was often the case for sweatshops). The formation of the International Labour Organization in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the Progressive Era in the United States saw the passage of new workers&#x27; rights laws and ultimately resulted in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, passed during the New Deal.

====Late 20th century to present====

On February 4, 1997, Mayor Ed Boyle of North Olmsted, in the U.S. state of Ohio, introduced the first piece of legislation prohibiting the government from purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners and incarcerated criminals. Similar legislation was subsequently passed in other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco. Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately endorsed, and he was invited by President Bill Clinton to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.

Clothing and footwear factories overseas have progressively improved working conditions because of the high demand of anti-sweatshop movement labor rights advocates. Sweatshops overseas have been receiving enormous amounts of pressure. The working conditions from college students, and other opponents of sweatshops have led to some of the powerful companies like Nike and the Gap who have agreed to cut back on child labour, restrict the use of dangerous and poisonous chemicals, and drop the average rate of employees working 80-hour weeks, according to groups that monitor such factories. Labour advocates say this could be a major turning point after 4 decades of workers in Asia and Latin American factories being underpaid, underappreciated and working in an unsafe environment.

Recently, there have been strides to eradicate sweatshops through government action, for example by increasing the minimum wage. In China, a developing country that is known to be a hub for sweatshops due to relaxed labor laws, high population and low minimum wage, the minimum wage is set to be raised by approximately 7% in 10 provinces by the end of 2018. As well as these governments also enforced stricter labor laws in 2013 after the collapse of Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, a large 5 storied sweatshop that killed 1135 people due to the building not being up to code, Bangladeshi police shut down many other factories after safety checks were completed and not met. However, no action has been as beneficial to the anti-sweatshop movement as that of the rise of social media. Social media has allowed for the world to see exactly what companies are doing and how they are doing it instantaneously, for free and is distributed to a wide audience. The platforms have allowed for viral videos, hundreds of thousands of retweets of quotes or statistics, millions of liked and shared pictures etc. to be spread to consumers in regards to companies&#x27; production methods without any censorship and thus force brands to be more transparent and ethical with their production practices. This is because a brand&#x27;s reputation can be destroyed by a bystander with a smartphone who records a brand&#x27;s product being made in a sweatshop where its workers are treated inhumanely. 

However, social media isn’t just helping to expose brands who are using sweatshops and unethical production practices but also is allowing companies that are trying to increase awareness of the anti-sweatshop movement to spread their message quickly and efficiently. In some cases, it isn&#x27;t sure that name-calling and shaming is the most effective strategy. Globalization is a big factor in sweatshops within the firm. These lead firms depend on structural and cultural position. In which many are targeting the leading globalizer and lawmakers. A solution, that is offered is to combine structural and cultural values, to be embedded into policy. The anti-sweatshop activism states how firms lack structural power and cultural vulnerability. For example, in May 2017 Mama Cash and The Clean Clothes Campaign, both organizations that are working towards abolishing sweatshops as well as creating a world of sustainable and ethical apparel practices, worked together to create The Women Power Fashion Pop-up. The event took place in Amsterdam and allowed consumers to sit in a room designed to look and feel like a sweatshop and were forced to create 100 ties in an hour which is synonymous to that of the expectations of women working in sweatshops today. This pop-up allowed consumers to actually experience the life of a sweatshop worker for a limited time and thus made them more sympathetic to the cause. Outside of the pop-up was a petition that consumers could sign to convince brands to be more transparent with their clothing manufacturing processes. The campaign went viral and created a significant buzz for the anti-sweatshop movement as well as the work of Mama Cash and The Clean Clothes Campaign.
In recent years, the notion of the ethical consumer has risen. Consumers not only are important to modern markets but also influence the decisions made by companies. These consumers make buying decisions based on how the product was made, by whom and under what conditions, as well as the environmental consequences of production and consumption. This set of criteria means that consumption decisions are not only based on one&#x27;s satisfaction with a purchase but also other aspects such as the environment and the well-being of workers in clothing factories.

===Sweatshop-free===

Sweatshop-free is a term the fashion brand American Apparel created to mean coercion-free, fair compensation for garment workers who make their products. American Apparel claims its employees earn on average double the federal minimum wage. They receive some employee benefits, from health insurance to subsidized transportation and meals, and have access to an onsite medical clinic. It has been heavily featured in the company&#x27;s advertisements for nearly a decade and has become a common term in the garment industry.

==Debate over the effects of globalization and sweatshops==

===Criticisms===
More recently, the anti-globalization movement has arisen in opposition to corporate globalization, the process by which multinational corporations move their operations overseas to lower costs and increase profits. The anti-sweatshop movement has much in common with the anti-globalization movement. Both consider sweatshops harmful, and both have accused many companies (such as the Walt Disney Company, The Gap, and Nike) of using sweatshops. Some in these movements charge that neoliberal globalization is similar to the sweating system, arguing that there tends to be a &quot;race to the bottom&quot; as multinationals leap from one low-wage country to another searching for lower production costs, in the same way that &quot;sweaters&quot; would have steered production to the lowest cost sub-contractor.Various groups support or embody the anti-sweatshop movement today. The National Labor Committee brought sweatshops into the mainstream media in the 1990s when it exposed the use of sweatshop and child labor to sew clothing for Kathie Lee Gifford&#x27;s Wal-Mart label. United Students Against Sweatshops is active on college campuses. The International Labor Rights Fund filed a lawsuit on behalf of workers in China, Nicaragua, Swaziland, Indonesia, and Bangladesh against Wal-Mart charging the company with knowingly developing purchasing policies particularly relating to price and delivery time that are impossible to meet while following the Wal-Mart code of conduct. Labor unions, such as the AFL–CIO, have helped support the anti-sweatshop movement out of concern both for the welfare of workers in the developing world and those in the United States.

Social critics complain that sweatshop workers often do not earn enough money to buy the products that they make, even though such items are often commonplace goods such as T-shirts, shoes, and toys. In 2003, Honduran garment factory workers were paid US$0.24 for each $50 Sean John sweatshirt, $0.15 for each long-sleeved T-shirt, and only five cents for each short-sleeved shirt – less than one-half of one percent of the retail price. Even comparing international costs of living, the $0.15 that a Honduran worker earned for the long-sleeved T-shirt was equal in purchasing power to $0.50 in the United States. In countries where labor costs are low, bras that cost US$5–7 apiece retail for US$50 or more in American stores. , female garment workers in India earned about US$2.20 per day.

Anti-globalization proponents cite high savings, increased capital investment in developing nations, diversification of their exports and their status as trade ports as the reason for their economic success rather than sweatshops and cite the numerous cases in the East Asian &quot;Tiger Economies&quot; where sweatshops have reduced living standards and wages. They believe that better-paying jobs, increased capital investment and domestic ownership of resources will improve the economies of sub-Saharan Africa rather than sweatshops. They point to good labor standards developing strong manufacturing export sectors in wealthier sub-Saharan countries such as Mauritius.

Anti-globalization organizations argue that the minor gains made by employees of some of these institutions are outweighed by the negative costs such as lowered wages to increase profit margins and that the institutions pay less than the daily expenses of their workers. They also point to the fact that sometimes local jobs offered higher wages before trade liberalization provided tax incentives to allow sweatshops to replace former local unionized jobs. They further contend that sweatshop jobs are not necessarily inevitable. Éric Toussaint claims that quality of life in developing countries was actually higher between 1945 and 1980 before the international debt crisis of 1982 harmed economies in developing countries causing them to turn to IMF and World Bank-organized &quot;structural adjustments&quot; and that unionized jobs pay more than sweatshop ones overall – &quot;several studies of workers producing for US firms in Mexico are instructive: workers at the Aluminum Company of America&#x27;s Ciudad Acuna plant earn between $21.44 and $24.60 per week, but a weekly basket of basic food items costs $26.87. Mexican GM workers earn enough to buy a pound of apples in 30 minutes of work, while GM workers in the US earn as much in 5 minutes.&quot; People critical of sweatshops believe that &quot;free trade agreements&quot; do not truly promote free trade at all but instead seek to protect multinational corporations from competition by local industries (which are sometimes unionized). They believe free trade should only involve reducing tariffs and barriers to entry and that multinational businesses should operate within the laws in the countries they want to do business in rather than seeking immunity from obeying local environmental and labor laws. They believe these conditions are what give rise to sweatshops rather than natural industrialization or economic progression.

In some countries, such as China, it is not uncommon for these institutions to withhold workers&#x27; pay.
Furthermore, anti-globalization proponents argue that those in the West who defend sweatshops show double standards by complaining about sweatshop labor conditions in countries considered enemies or hostile by Western governments, while still gladly consuming their exports but complaining about the quality. They contend that multinational jobs should be expected to operate according to international labor and environmental laws and minimum wage standards like businesses in the West do.

Labor historian Erik Loomis claims that the conditions faced by workers in the United States in the Gilded Age have been replicated in developing countries where Western corporations utilize sweatshop labor. In particular, he compares the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911 New York to the collapse of Rana Plaza in 2013 Bangladesh. He argues that the former galvanized the population to political activism that eventually pushed through reforms not only pertaining to workplace safety, but also the minimum wage, the eight-hour day, workers&#x27; compensation, Social Security the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act. American corporations responded by shifting production to developing nations where such protections did not exist. Loomis elaborates:

===Support===
In 1997, economist Jeffrey Sachs said, &quot;My concern is not that there are too many sweatshops, but that there are too few.&quot; Sachs and other proponents of free trade and the global movement of capital cite the economic theory of comparative advantage, which states that international trade will, in the long run, make all parties better off. The theory holds that developing countries improve their condition by doing something that they do &quot;better&quot; than industrialized nations (in this case, they charge less but do the same work). Developed countries will also be better off because their workers can shift to jobs that they do better. These are jobs that some economists say usually entail a level of education and training that is exceptionally difficult to obtain in the developing world. Thus, economists like Sachs say, developing countries get factories and jobs that they would not otherwise. Some would say with this situation occurs when developing countries try to increase wages because sweatshops tend to just get moved on to a new state that is more welcoming. This leads to a situation where states often don&#x27;t try to increase wages for sweatshop workers for fear of losing investment and boosted GDP. However, this only means average wages around the world will increase at a steady rate. A nation only gets left behind if it demands wages higher than the current market price for that labor.

When asked about the working condition in sweatshops, proponents say that although wages and working conditions may appear inferior by the standards of developed nations, they are actually improvements over what the people in developing countries had before. It is said that if jobs in such factories did not improve their workers&#x27; standard of living, those workers would not have taken the jobs when they appeared. It is also often pointed out that, unlike in the industrialized world, the sweatshops are not replacing high-paying jobs. Rather, sweatshops offer an improvement over subsistence farming and other back-breaking tasks, or even prostitution, trash picking, or starvation by unemployment.

Sweatshops can mentally and physically affect the workers who work there due to unacceptable conditions which include working long hours. Despite the hardships, sweatshops were a source of income for their workers. The absence of the work opportunities provided by sweatshops can quickly lead to malnourishment or starvation. After the Child Labor Deterrence Act was introduced in the US, an estimated 50,000 children were dismissed from their garment industry jobs in Bangladesh, leaving many to resort to jobs such as &quot;stone-crushing, street hustling, and prostitution&quot;. UNICEF&#x27;s 1997 &quot;State of the World&#x27;s Children&quot; study found these alternative jobs &quot;more hazardous and exploitative than garment production&quot;. As Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman states in a 1997 article for Slate, &quot;as manufacturing grows in poor countries, it creates a ripple effect that benefits ordinary people: &#x27;The pressure on the land becomes less intense, so rural wages rise; the pool of unemployed urban dwellers always anxious for work shrinks, so factories start to compete with each other for workers, and urban wages also begin to rise.&#x27; In time average wages creep up to a level comparable to minimum-wage jobs in the United States.&quot;

Writer Johan Norberg, a proponent of market economics, points out an irony:
Heavy-handed responses to reports of child labor and worker rights abuses such as widespread boycotts can be counterproductive if the net effect is simply to eliminate contracts with suppliers rather than to reform their employment practices. A 2005 article in the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; states, &quot;For example, in Honduras, the site of the infamous Kathy Lee Gifford sweatshop scandal, the average apparel worker earns $13.10 per day, yet 44 percent of the country&#x27;s population lives on less than $2 per day... In Cambodia, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Honduras, the average wage paid by a firm accused of being a sweatshop is more than double the average income in that country&#x27;s economy.&quot; Journalist Radley Balko reported in 2004 that on three documented occasions during the 1990s, anti-sweatshop activists apparently caused increases in child prostitution in poor countries: in Bangladesh, the closure of several sweatshops run by a German company put Bangladeshi children out of work, and some ended up working as prostitutes, turning to crime, or starving to death; in Pakistan, several sweatshops closed, run by Nike and Reebok, which caused some of those Pakistani children to turn to prostitution; and in Nepal, a boycott of Nepal&#x27;s carpet industry forced thousands of child laborers out of work, resulting in &quot;a large percentage&quot; of them turning to prostitution.

A 1996 study of corporate codes of conduct in the apparel industry by the U.S. Department of Labor has concluded that corporate codes of conduct that monitor labor norms in the apparel industry, rather than boycott or eliminate contracts upon the discovery of violations of internationally recognized labor norms, are a more effective way to eliminate child labor and the exploitation of children, provided they provide for effective monitoring that includes the participation of workers and their knowledge of the standards to which their employers are subject.

Arguably, the United States underwent a similar process during its own industrialization where child labor and the suppression of worker organizations were prevalent. According to an article in Gale Opposing Viewpoints in Context, sweatshops became prevalent in the United States during the Industrial Revolution. Although the working conditions and wages in these factories were very poor, as new jobs in factories began to appear, people left the hard life of farming to work in these factories, and the agricultural nature of the economy shifted into a manufacturing one because of this industrialization. However, during this new industrialized economy, the labor movement drove the rise in the average level of income as factory workers began to demand better wages and working conditions. Through much struggle, sufficient wealth was created and a large middle class began to emerge. Workers and advocates were able to achieve basic rights for workers, which included the right to form unions, and negotiate terms such as wages, overtime pay, health insurance, and retirement pensions; and eventually they were also able to attain legal protections such as minimum wage standards, and discrimination and sexual abuse protections. Furthermore, Congress set forth to ensure a minimum set of safety standards were followed in workplaces by passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in 1970. These developments were able to improve working environments for Americans but it was through sweatshops that the economy grew and people were able to accumulate wealth and move out of poverty.

In contrast, similar efforts in developing nations have not produced the same results, because of corruption and lack of democracy in communist nations such as China and Vietnam, worker intimidation and murder in Latin America—and corruption throughout the developing world. These barriers prevent creation of similar legal protections for workers in these countries, as numerous studies by the International Labour Organization show. Nonetheless, a boycott approach to protesting these conditions is likely to hurt workers willing to accept employment even under poor working conditions, as a loss of employment would result in a comparatively worse level of poverty. According to a November 2001 BBC article, in the previous two months, 100,000 sweatshop workers in Bangladesh had been put off work. The workers petitioned their government to lobby the U.S. government to repeal its trade barriers on their behalf to retain their jobs.

Defenders of sweatshops cite Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan as recent examples of countries that benefited from having sweatshops.

In these countries, legislative and regulatory frameworks to protect and promote labor rights and the rights of workers against unsafe and exploitative working conditions exist, and studies have shown no systematic relationship between labor rights, such as collective bargaining and the freedom of association, and national economic growth.

A major issue for the anti-sweatshop movement is the fate of workers displaced by the closing of sweatshops. Even after escaping the sweatshop industry the workers need a job to sustain themselves and their families. For example, in Bangladesh, a country with one of the lowest minimum wages in the world, of $68 per month, the Rana Plaza a known sweatshop that hosted garment factories for retailers such as Primark, JC Penney, Joe Fresh and Benetton, collapsed as it was visibly not structurally sound. After the incident many of the workers were displaced as not only did the Rana Plaza close down but the government also called for safety checks of many factories that were then shut down as a result of not being up to code. Although this may seem like a positive consequence many of those workers were then unable to get jobs and support their families. The garment industry in Bangladesh is worth $28 billion.

<text>Den Helder () is a municipality and a city in the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. Den Helder occupies the northernmost point of the North Holland peninsula. It is home to the country&#x27;s main naval base.
From here the Royal TESO ferryboat service operates the transportation link between Den Helder and the nearby Dutch Wadden island of Texel to the north.

== Etymology ==
Before the year 1928, the official name of Den Helder was Helder. The origin of the name Helder is not entirely clear. The name Helder may have come from &quot;Helle/Helde&quot;, which means &quot;hill&quot; or &quot;hilly grounds&quot;, or from &quot;Helre&quot;, which means a sandy ridge. Another explanation is that the name derived from &quot;Helsdeur&quot; (Hell&#x27;s Door), likely because in the water between Den Helder and Texel (called Marsdiep) the current was so strong that many ships were lost.

== History ==
Huisduinen was the original older part of the city, whereas Helder itself was a nearby smaller hamlet. When a harbour was built near Helder the village began to grow and later became the seat of governance instead of Huisduinen. Due to its strategic location at the tip of the North Holland peninsula, multiple fortifications were built in the area.

Den Helder has played an important part in Dutch shipping. During the Dutch Golden Age, ships would be assembled near Den Helder and sail the world&#x27;s oceans from there.

On 23January 1795, the French captured 14 Dutch ships and 850 guns in the town&#x27;s deep-frozen harbour. In 1799 the city was the target of the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland.

During the 1820s, the North Holland Canal was dug from Amsterdam to Den Helder. The lighthouse &quot;Lange Jaap&quot; was built in 1877 and is the tallest cast-iron lighthouse in Europe, at . In the Second World War most of the city was evacuated and the old city center was destroyed.

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
Den Helder is on the tip of a lowland peninsula jutting out into the North Sea Because of this, Den Helder&#x27;s climate is heavily moderated by the maritime environment. Also, Den Helder is one of the sunniest cities in the Netherlands.

=== Population centres ===
The municipality of Den Helder consists of the following cities, towns, villages and/or districts: Den Helder, Huisduinen, Julianadorp, and the hamlets Friese Buurt and De Kooy.

The major areas of Den Helder are the Stad Binnen de Linie (a city within the city&#x27;s defence line), Nieuw-Den Helder, and De Schooten. Nieuw-Den Helder was built in the 1950s, following World War II, when there was a great need for additional housing. De Schooten was constructed in the 1960s.

=== Topography ===

== Naval base and fortifications ==

Den Helder was the site of a naval base as early as the 18th century. An Anglo-Russian invasion force landed at Den Helder in August 1799 and captured the Batavian navy there (see Battle of Castricum). French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, visiting Den Helder in 1811, was impressed with the town&#x27;s strategic location and ordered the construction of a fort (Kijkduin) and naval dockyards (Willemsoord). The docks were built during the years 1813–1827. In 1947, it officially became the Royal Netherlands Navy&#x27;s main centre of operations. Den Helder continues to be the navy&#x27;s main base today. The Royal Netherlands Naval College is also located in the city, as is the Dutch Navy Museum.
The old naval dockyards of Willemsoord, located in the north of the city, now house restaurants, a cinema, and other recreational facilities. The naval docks and administration have been moved to a new location further east.
The Fortifications of Den Helder, which protected the naval base and the entrance to the Noordhollandsch Kanaal significantly altered the landscape around Den Helder. A number of the old fortresses have now been repurposed for tourism and related industries and can be visited.

== Transport ==

The town is served by two railway stations:

<text>Four on the Floor is a sketch comedy series which aired on CBC Television in 1986. Consisting of only 13 episodes, the series was a showcase for The Frantics, a comedy troupe consisting of Paul Chato, Rick Green, Dan Redican and Peter Wildman. In the U.K., it aired in Channel 4&#x27;s traditional Friday night comedy slot, from 10 June to 2 September 1988.

The introduction was voiced by Dan and Rick alternating each line, with video clips and sound effects interspersed in the opening.

Although the series was quickly cancelled due to CBC budget constraints, it was an important influence on later Canadian sketch comedy, such as &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;.

==Character==
The show&#x27;s most famous character was Mr. Canoehead, a quintessentially Canadian superhero: on a canoeing trip in Algonquin Park, he was hit by lightning while portaging his aluminum canoe, which became permanently welded to his head. As a crime fighter, he would capture criminals by turning around so that the canoe knocked them over.

The character had been originally developed for the radio show &quot;Frantic Times&quot;, with the troupe initially uncertain how to make the sketch work for television.

<doc id="102078" wikidata="Q936482" url="?curid=102078" title="Murray-Sunset National Park">
<text>The Murray-Sunset National Park is the second largest national park in Victoria, Australia, located in the Mallee district in the northwestern corner of the state, bordering South Australia. The national park is situated approximately northwest of Melbourne and was proclaimed in 1991. It is in the northwestern corner of the state, bordering South Australia to the west and the Murray River to the north. The Sturt Highway passes through the northern part of the park, but most of the park is in the remote area between the Sturt Highway and the Mallee Highway, west of the Calder Highway.

==History==
The park was created in 1991, and expanded to encompass Pink Lakes State Park in 1999. The lakes are dubbed &quot;pink&quot; after the beta-carotene pigment that colours it in late summer, caused by the algae &quot;Dunaliella salina&quot;. This area was the site of a major salt industry from 1916 to 1975. At its peak, ten thousand tons of salt was harvested and railed from Lake Crosbie, Lake Becking and Lake Kenyon to the nearby town of Linga. For management purposes, the Murray-Sunset National Park is managed with the Hattah-Kulkyne National Park, Wyperfeld National Park, Lake Albacutya Park and Murray-Kulkyne Park as part of the Victorian Mallee Parks.

Another defunct railway, the Nowingi line, terminates at the remains of a gypsum mine hopper on the Raak Plain. Other historical relics include Shearer&#x27;s Quarters and Mopoke Hut, built as grazier accommodation in the 1960s.

==Flora and fauna==

Over 600 species of plants have been recorded, and 300 species of birds. Notable plants include Murray lily, silvery emu-bush, saltbush, buloke, porcupine grass, blue-leaved mallee and other mallee eucalypts. In spring, wildflowers include spider orchids, azure sun orchids, desert heath-myrtles and poached-egg daisies.

Emus, wedge-tailed eagles, and both western grey and red kangaroos are present.

===Important Bird Area===
Most of the park lies within the Murray-Sunset, Hattah and Annuello Important Bird Area (IBA), so identified by BirdLife International because it contains mallee habitat supporting a suite of threatened mallee bird species, including the malleefowl, black-eared miner and mallee emu-wren.

==Attractions==
The park is attractive to bushwalkers as the nearest semi-arid region to Melbourne. Walks include circuits of Lake Crosbie and Lake Kenyon, and the three-day Sunset walking track. Groundwater is scarce, and hikers generally rely on water tanks maintained by rangers.

The Pink Lakes are medium-sized salt lakes. In late summer a red pigment, carotene, is secreted from the alga &quot;Dunaliella salina&quot; and gives a distinct pink colour to the lakes.

<text>The Great Otway National Park is a national park located in the Barwon South West region of Victoria, Australia. The national park is situated approximately southwest of Melbourne, in the Otway Ranges, a low coastal mountain range. It contains a diverse range of landscapes and vegetation types.

==History==
Commercial logging began in the Otway Ranges in the 1880s. After World War One, with improvements to the roads and railways, logging increased massively, peaking in 1961, almost entirely stripping the Otway Ranges of its old-growth forest and causing land degradation issues, but has since been greatly reduced. The forest standing today highlights the lengthy period needed to regrow the giant trees of the past and to reproduce the ecological complexity nearing that of the original wild forest. Historically, several bushfires have burnt through the park&#x27;s predecessor reserves, shaping its ecology and plant and animal diversity. The last major fire was part of the Ash Wednesday bushfires that swept southeastern Australia in 1983.

The park was declared in 2004 when Otway National Park, Angahook-Lorne State Park, Carlisle State Park, Melba Gully State Park, areas of the Otway State Forest and a number of Crown Land reserves were combined into one park. The parks were combined after a campaign by the local community and the Otway Ranges Environment Network and was officially gazetted on 11 December 2005.

==Features==
The Great Otway National Park is popular with Victorian, interstate, and international tourists, with a number of companies operating tours in the region. It contains three camping areas at &quot;Johanna&quot;, &quot;Aire River&quot; and &quot;Blanket Bay&quot;. The park is accessed from the east via Apollo Bay, from the north via Forrest or Beech Forest, or from the west via Princetown. The park covers both coastline and hinterland in the Otway Ranges and so includes both beaches and forest, accessible via walking trails. The park and the Aire River campground are home to a significant koala population. The Cape Otway Lighthouse is adjacent to the park and is open to tourists throughout the week. Migrating whales and dolphins such as southern right and southern humpback, and bottlenose dolphins can be observed from the coasts.

Glow worms (&quot;Arachnocampa otwayensis&quot;), which are the bioluminescent larvae of small flies known as fungus gnats, can be seen at night along the stream banks and walking tracks, particularly at Angahook-Lorne State Park, Beauchamp Falls, Hopetoun Falls, Stevenson Falls and Melba Gully State Park.

===Important Bird Area===
The park has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of rufous bristlebirds, striated fieldwrens and pink robins, as well as numerous other species.

==Climate==

The area has a very wet temperate oceanic climate (&quot;cfb&quot;). 

Climate data for the Otway Ranges are sourced from Weeaproinah, at an elevation of ; operating between 1965 and 2012. The Otway Ranges feature a cold rainforest biome with extreme winter rainfall, which owes to its highly exposed location in the far south-west of the state. Heavy snowfalls occur on the higher peaks each year, such as Mount Cowley at ; wet snow can also fall nearer to sea level on rare occasions. 

It has the greatest amount of precipitation days in mainland Australia (219), narrowly beating out Mount William&#x27;s 215 days, though the latter site has only nineteen years of record.

== Fungi ==
The Great Otway National Park is extremely rich in fungal diversity. Although hundreds of species of flora and fauna are listed in the Great Otway National Park Management Plan , there is only a single reference to fungi. The reference is to the fungal pathogen, &quot;Chalara australis&quot; that affects myrtle beech. However, the great majority of fungi in the Park perform beneficial ecological roles. In fact, most fungi perform positive rather than negative roles. Even parasitic fungi – often regarded only negatively – are a vital part of healthy ecosystems, regulating ecosystem functions.

As primary recyclers of organic matter, saprobic fungi break down fallen branches and leaf litter, making vital nutrients available to other organisms. Other fungi form symbiotic relationships with other organisms. Although rarely acknowledged, the great majority of plants in the Great Otway National Park (indeed in the world) form mutually beneficial mycorrhizal relationships with fungi.

Given the great diversity of plants, specialist habitats and micro-climates in the park, a great diversity of fungi, including lichens, is also expected to occur there. Two hundred and seventy-eight species of fungi are listed in the Atlas of Living Australia. This is likely to be only a fraction of the total number of fungal species that grow in the Park.

Despite their essential roles in underpinning terrestrial ecosystems, fungi are barely recognised as a vital part of Australia&#x27;s biodiversity. Although Australia has national and state level biodiversity conservation strategies and has ratified international conventions, most overlook fungi. There is currently no statewide biodiversity strategy for managing biodiversity in Victoria and the Colac Otway Shire Environment Strategy makes no reference to fungi. There is however, a great deal of interest in fungi among the local community. The Southern Otways Landcare Network have been actively involved in learning about and surveying the Park&#x27;s fungi in recent years and produced a guide to one hundred of the more easily recognisable fungal species found in the park.

The Australian citizen-science organisation, Fungimap is also documenting and mapping the distribution of fungi including those that occur in the Great Otway National Park.

One of the tiniest yet conspicuous species found in the wetter parts of the park is the ruby bonnet (&quot;Mycena viscidocruenta&quot;). The ghost fungus (&quot;Omphalotus nidiformis&quot;) grows on trees and is another easily recognisable species, especially at night when it glows a pale green. The rosette fungus (&quot;Podoscypha petalodes&quot;) often appears in funnel-shaped rosettes at the base of trees and among leaf litter and is widespread throughout the park. The flame fungus (&quot;Clavaria miniata&quot;) grows singly or in groups on soil.

<doc id="102081" wikidata="Q84125" url="?curid=102081" title="Gouda, South Holland">
<text>Gouda () is a city and municipality in the west of the Netherlands, between Rotterdam and Utrecht, in the province of South Holland. Gouda has a population of 75,000 and is famous for its Gouda cheese, stroopwafels, many , smoking pipes, and its 15th-century city hall. Its array of historic churches and other buildings makes it a very popular day-trip destination.

In the Middle Ages the family founded a settlement at the location of the current city and built a fortified castle alongside the banks of the Gouwe River, from which the family and the city took their names. Locals long called the settlement , or or &quot;&quot; for short.
The area, originally marshland, developed over the course of two centuries. By 1225, a canal was linked to the Gouwe and its estuary became a harbour. In 1272 Floris V, Count of Holland granted the city city rights.

==History==

Around the year 1100, the area of present-day Gouda was swampy and covered with a peat forest, crossed by small creeks such as the Gouwe. Along the shores of this stream near the current market and city hall, peat harvesting began in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1139, the name &quot;Gouda&quot; was first mentioned in a document of the Bishop of Utrecht.

In the 13th century, the Gouwe was connected to the Oude Rijn (Old Rhine) by means of a canal and its mouth at the Hollandse IJssel was developed into a harbour. Castle Gouda was built to protect this harbour. This shipping route was used for trade between Flanders and France with Holland and the Baltic Sea. In 1272, Floris V, Count of Holland, granted city rights to Gouda, which by then had become an important location. City-canals () were dug and served as transport ways through the town.

Great fires in 1361 and 1438 destroyed the city. In 1572, the city was occupied by les Gueux (Dutch rebels against the Spanish King) who also committed arson and destruction. In 1577 the demolition of Castle Gouda began.

1551 marked the founding of the oldest still-functioning inn, De Zalm, located on Markt 34, near the historic Waag building.

In 1574, 1625, 1636, and 1673, Gouda suffered from deadly plague epidemics, of which the last one was the most severe: 2995 persons died, constituting 20% of its population.

In the last quarter of the 16th century, Gouda had serious economic problems. It recovered in the first half of the 17th century and even prospered between 1665 and 1672. However, its economy collapsed again when the Franco-Dutch War broke out in 1672 and the plague decimated the city in 1673, even affecting the pipe industry. After 1700, Gouda enjoyed a period of progress and prosperity until 1730. Then another recession followed, resulting in a long period of decline that lasted well into the 19th century. Gouda was one of the poorest cities in the Netherlands during that period: the terms &quot;Goudaner&quot; and &quot;beggar&quot; were considered synonymous.

Starting in 1830, demolition of the city walls began. The last city gate was torn down in 1854. Only from the second half of the 19th century onward did Gouda start to profit from improved economic conditions. New companies, such as &quot;Stearine Kaarsenfabriek&quot; (Stearine Candle Factory) and &quot;Machinale Garenspinnerij&quot; (Mechanized Yarn Spinnery), gave impetus to its economy. In 1855, the Gouda-Utrecht railway began operations. At the beginning of the 20th century, large-scale development began, extending the city beyond its moats. First the new neighbourhoods Korte Akkeren, Kort Haarlem and Kadebuurt were built, followed by , , and after World War II.

From 1940 on, back-filling of the city moats and city-canals, the grachten, began: the Nieuwehaven, Raam, Naaierstraat, and Achter de Vismarkt. However, because of protests from city dwellers and revised policies of city planners, Gouda did not continue back-filling moats and city-canals, now considered historically valuable. In 1944, the railway station was damaged during an Allied bombardment which killed eight and wounded ten persons. This bombardment was intended to destroy the railroad connecting The Hague and Rotterdam to Utrecht.

After the war, the city started to expand and nearly tripled in size. New neighbourhoods, such as Gouda-Oost, Bloemendaal and Goverwelle were built. In recent years there has been a shift from expanding the city towards urban renewal and gentrification.

==Demographics==
==Economy==

Gouda is known for its Gouda cheese, which is still traded on its cheese market, held each Thursday. Gouda is also known for the fabrication of candles, smoking pipes, and stroopwafels. Gouda used to have a considerable linen industry and several beer breweries.

Gouda cheese is not made in the city itself, but rather in the surrounding region. It derives its name from being traded in Gouda where the city council imposes stringent quality controls.

The economy of the city centre is based on tourism, leisure and retail, while offices are located at the outskirts of the city. Currently, there are over 32,000 jobs in the city, mainly in commercial and healthcare services.

==Attractions==
* Old City Hall at the Markt square - built between 1448 and 1450, one of the oldest Gothic city halls in the Netherlands;
* The &quot;Waag&quot; (weigh house) - built in 1667 across from the Old City Hall, this building was used for weighing goods (especially cheese) to levy taxes. It now is a national monument. It currently hosts a small cheese museum;
* Grote or St. Jans Kerk (Great or Saint John&#x27;s Church) - longest church in the Netherlands, famous for its stained glass windows which were made between 1530 and 1603, considered the most significant stained glass collection in the Netherlands. Even in the 17th century, it already was a tourist attraction;
* - museum about the history and arts of the city;
* Verzetsmuseum - a museum about the Dutch resistance during World War II, the collection currently in storage as museum building closed in November 2018;
* Museumhaven Gouda - small harbour with historic ships;
* Goudse Schouwburg - large theatre;
* Waaiersluis (Waaier Locks) - a historic lock on the Hollandse IJssel just east of Gouda.

==Events==
* Gouda Cheese &amp; Craft Market, every Thursday from 10:00 - 13:00h (April–August). According to &quot;Stichting Goudse Kaas&quot;, it attracted 60,000 tourists each year (as of 2017).
* Gouda Ceramics Days, a yearly two-day event of ceramists from the Netherlands and several other countries. Several exhibitions. May 29 10:00 - 17:00h and May 30 10:00 - 16:00h around the Old City Hall.
* Gouda&#x27;s Monmartre, antique/curio/flea/collector&#x27;s market, weekly on Wednesdays around the Old City Hall during summer from June 4 - Sept. 10, 2014.
* Gouda Water City Festival weekend of June 21, 2014
* Gouda by Candlelight - an annual Christmas event held in mid-December, featuring attractions in the city centre. In the evening, a Christmas tree, an annual gift from the sister city of Kongsberg, is lit in the market place. Carols are sung by famous Dutch singers accompanied by choirs. The windows of the Old City Hall and the surrounding houses are lit by Gouda candles.

===Music===
*Warmaster, old school death metal band

==Transport==
Gouda is served by two railway stations, Gouda and Gouda Goverwelle. The main railway station is served by Intercity services to The Hague, Rotterdam, and Utrecht and local trains to Amsterdam and Alphen aan den Rijn/Leiden.

The city also lies alongside the A12 and A20 motorways.

<text>The Port Campbell National Park is a national park in the south-western district of Victoria, Australia. The national park is situated approximately south-west of Melbourne and approximately east of Warrnambool. The park is located adjacent to the Great Otway National Park and the Bay of Islands Coastal Park.

==History==
The Port Campbell National Park was dedicated on , initially with , in order to protect the limestone formations on and near the coastline adjacent to the Great Ocean Road. By 1981 the park had grown to ; extending from the eastern side of Curdies Inlet at Peterborough to Point Ronald at Princetown. In 2002, the Port Campbell Professional Fishermen&#x27;s Association unsuccessfully attempted to block the creation of a proposed marine national park at the Twelve Apostles location, but were satisfied with the later Victorian Government decision not to allow seismic exploration at the same site by Benaris Energy; believing it would harm marine life.

==Features==
The Port Campbell National Park features an array of sheer cliffs overlooking offshore islets, rock stacks, gorges, arches, and blow-holes. As part of the &quot;Shipwreck Coast&quot;, it hosts several tourist attractions; including The Twelve Apostles, the London Bridge, Loch Ard Gorge, the Gibson Steps, and The Grotto.

The park is subject to salt-laden breezes, and the cliff-tops are particularly exposed to the harsh weather conditions from the Southern Ocean. However, fragile grasslands and heaths are still able to develop, supporting plant species such as sun orchid and spider orchid. In protected areas, plant life includes beard-heath, bower spinach, coast daisy bush, daisies and cushion bush. The wilder terrain hosts an assortment of she-oaks, dogwoods, correa, messmate, trailing guinea-flower, woolly tea-tree and scented paperbark.

The fauna in the park is largely ornithological; and includes honeyeaters, southern emu and fairy wrens, swamp harriers, rufous bristlebird, peregrine falcons, pelicans, ducks, black swans and egrets. Penguins, terns and dotterels are located along the shoreline, with hooded plovers nesting in exposed locations. Australasian gannets, wandering albatrosses and short-tailed shearwaters live out at sea. Land animals in the park include southern brown bandicoot, swamp antechinuse and echidna.

<text>The Snowy River National Park is a national park located in the Alpine and East Gippsland regions of Victoria, Australia. The national park is situated approximately northeast of Melbourne and southwest of Canberra, south of the Black-Allan Line that marks part of the border between Victoria and New South Wales.

On 7 November 2008, the park was added to the Australian National Heritage List as one of eleven areas constituting the Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves.

== History ==
Some Aboriginal relics were discovered on the Snowy River which indicated that the Kruatungulung group of the Kurnai people used to hunt here. It was in the 1840s that cattlemen and miners visited the region and started using the higher land for summer grazing and introduced silver mining. The proposal for the national park was submitted in 1935, but the establishment took place in 1979.

==Location and features==
Declared on , much of the park is classified as wilderness area, where vehicles are unable to visit. Within the national park is the Little River Gorge, Victoria&#x27;s deepest gorge, with the Little River descending off the Wulgulmerang plateau over to the Snowy River at an elevation of above sea level.

The park provides one of the last natural habitats at the Little River Gorge for the endangered brush-tailed rock wallaby. Numbers for this species are estimated as extremely small, with the rugged terrain making it difficult to accurately monitor the species population. Over 250 native species have been recorded in the park, 29 of which are considered rare or threatened in Victoria, including the long-footed potoroo, spotted quoll (tiger quoll), giant burrowing frog and &quot;Cyclodomorphus michaeli&quot;.

McKillops Road is the northern park boundary, with the Alpine National Park to the north of the road. The road is designated unsuitable for caravans, trailers and semi-trailers due to its long, narrow, and steep descent down to McKillops Bridge which crosses the Snowy River near its juncture with the Deddick River. The park is also located adjacent to the Errinundra National Park, the Coopracambra National Park, and the nearby Croajingolong National Park and Cape Conran Coastal Park.

<doc id="102084" wikidata="Q1792589" url="?curid=102084" title="Tarra-Bulga National Park">
<text>The Tarra-Bulga National Park is a small national park located in the South Gippsland region of eastern Victoria, Australia approximately south east of Melbourne. The park is located south of Traralgon on the Traralgon-Balook Road and north of .

The national park is situated in the eastern part of the Strzelecki Ranges. The national park is home to one of the last undisturbed remnants of the native eucalypt temperate rainforest that once covered the Strzelecki Ranges until the last decades of the nineteenth century. The pocket of undisturbed mountain ash forest, fern gully communities and associated native Myrtle Beech stands within the park are of considerable biogeographical significance.

==History==

Alberton Shire Council asked the Victorian Government to set aside forest with fern gullies near Balook as a public park in 1903. The first area to be reserved was in 1904 and named Bulga National Park after the Gunai language word &quot;bulga&quot;, meaning mountain.

In 1906 Tarra Valley National Park was designated nearby, temporarily comprising , then later reduced to . Tarra Valley is named after Indigenous Burra Burra man Charley Tarra, who guided Count Paweł Strzelecki on his expedition through this area of Gippsland in 1840.

The two parks were merged to form Tarra-Bulga National Park following recommendations by the Land Conservation Council. The parks were joined through a land exchange with APM Forests Pty Ltd. An enlarged and renamed park of hectares was declared on . By 1990 Tarra-Bulga National Park covered , increasing to in 2005.

===Kara Healey===
Maori-Australian woman Kara Moana Healey was a park ranger in the Tarra Valley from 1952 to 1963, who was celebrated for her contribution to the park with a ceremony and plaque as part of the centenary celebration of the park in 2007.

A field collector, conservationist, preservationist and naturalist, Healey became the first female National Park Ranger in Victoria after responding to a call from the CSIRO to collect specimens for the National Herbarium of Victoria.

Over ten years, Healey collected specimens within the Tarra Valley, often visiting dangerous areas alone, where some of the unspoilt specimens were located and the nests of the lyrebird could be found. By 1961 Healey had collected over 160 specimens of fungi and including two new types that were named after her. The first was &quot;Poria healeyi&quot;, a fungus causing yellow straw rot in Mountain Ash, and the second was &quot;Lambertella healeyi&quot;, a fungus growing on another fungus.

Healey collected animal and insect specimens using dead animals that she found. In total, she collected over 500 specimens, including 80 species of moss. Subsequently, Tarra Valley was the most thoroughly studied and recorded area in Australia at the time.

== Features ==
There are many walking tracks that emanate from the picnic areas. The Tarra Valley Rainforest Walk is a short and easy walk taking in Cyathea Falls, and the Fern Gully Nature Walk, passes over Corrigan&#x27;s Suspension Bridge, which stretches through the rainforest canopy with views of the fern gully below. The three- to four-day Grand Strzelecki Track connects the park with the adjacent Morwell National Park.

The park is a popular tourist attraction with a visitor centre, picnic areas with tables, fireplaces shelters and toilets. The visitors centre is open on weekends and school and public holidays. It is staffed by members of the Friends of Tarra-Bulga National Park who also undertake restoration and monitoring activities.

Since 22 October 2010, the national park has been jointly managed by Parks Victoria in partnership with the Gunaikurnai people, who are the traditional owners of the land.

==Flora and fauna==
The deeply incised river valleys of the park are dominated by wet sclerophyll tall open forest of mountain ash (&quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot;), with an understory of blackwood (&quot;Acacia melanoxylon&quot;), hazel pomaderris (&quot;Pomaderris aspera&quot;) and tree ferns (&quot;Dicksonia antarctica&quot; and &quot;Cyathea australis&quot;). Pockets of the park feature cool temperate rainforest, including Myrtle Beech Nothofagus cunninghamii. The ridges are dominated by open forest and low open forest of stringybark eucalypts and gums. The park is also noted for its diversity of Fungi species, which are prominent in autumn.

The rainforest is a haven for plants and wildlife, and is particularly well known for its giant mountain ash trees and lush fern gullies. There are a wide variety of birds residing in the park including the pilotbird, yellow tailed black cockatoo, eastern whipbird, and currawongs. In the evening possums, owls and bats emerge to feed. Lyrebirds, wombats, swamp wallabies, gliders and platypuses can also be found within the park.

<text>The Terrick Terrick National Park is a national park located in the region of Victoria, Australia. The national park was declared in June 1988 and is situated approximately northwest of Melbourne, north of the town of Mitiamo and north of Bendigo. The national park is an important remnant of Box-Ironbark forests and northern grass plains and is close to Kow Swamp, the site of a major palaeontological find providing insight into the origins of Indigenous Australians. There are many walking tracks and one basic campground. Drinking water is not available in the park and must be carried.

Terrick Terrick National Park is one of the last remaining strongholds for the Plains-wanderer, an endangered Australian endemic bird species. The park is part of the Patho Plains Important Bird Area, so identified by BirdLife International principally because of its importance for the conservation of Plains-wanderers.

The minimum elevation of the terrain is 82m, and the maximum is 196m.

<doc id="102087" wikidata="Q273972" url="?curid=102087" title="Bondage (BDSM)">
<text>Bondage, in the BDSM subculture, is the practice of consensually tying, binding, or restraining a partner for erotic, aesthetic, or somatosensory stimulation. A partner may be physically restrained in a variety of ways, including the use of rope, cuffs, bondage tape, or self-adhering bandage.

Bondage itself does not necessarily imply sadomasochism. Bondage may be used as an end in itself, as in the case of rope bondage and breast bondage. It may also be used as a part of sex or in conjunction with other BDSM activities. The letter &quot;B&quot; in the acronym &quot;BDSM&quot; comes from the word &quot;bondage&quot;. Sexuality and erotica are an important aspect of bondage, but are often not the end in itself. Aesthetics also plays an important role in bondage.

A common reason for the active partner to tie up their partner is so both may gain pleasure from the restrained partner&#x27;s submission and the feeling of the temporary transfer of control and power. For sadomasochistic people, bondage is often used as a means to an end, where the restrained partner is more accessible to other sadomasochistic behaviour. However, bondage can also be used for its own sake. The restrained partner can derive sensual pleasure from the feeling of helplessness and immobility, and the active partner can derive visual pleasure and satisfaction from seeing their partner tied up.

==Bedroom==

Many couples incorporate bondage into their sex lives, often sporadically but sometimes more regularly, and find sexual bondage to be relationship-affirming. This sometimes takes the form of a sex game or sexual fantasy enactment. Bedroom bondage games may be used for sexual arousal or as a form of foreplay, that requires and implies a level of trust and a surrender of control by the restrained to the active partner. The restrained partner (called a &quot;submissive&quot;) surrenders control to the other partner (called a &quot;dominant&quot;). This surrender of control happens voluntarily and under mutual understanding and consent.

The main feature of sexual bondage is that it renders the restrained person vulnerable to a variety of sex acts, including some that they may be inhibited from otherwise engaging. The restrained partner is dependent for their sexual satisfaction on the actions of their partner, who may treat the restrained partner as their sex object.

There are many reasons why people allow themselves to be bound. Some people feel a kind of freedom during corporal passivity, they can concentrate on their inner spirituality and feel at peace, as a participant in a study about motivation for bondage explained: &quot;Some people have to be tied up to be free&quot;. Others experience helplessness, struggle against their bonds, and feel a degree of masochistic pleasure from the restraint and pain, as well as being unobstructed for erotic stimulation by their partner.

Bondage can be relatively simple to apply, enabling improvisation using household items and little experience, though sophisticated commercial apparatus is available. Bedroom bondage is usually mild bondage, with one partner voluntarily being put into restraints by being tied up or handcuffed. It may involve simple hand ties, bed restraints, being tied to a chair, etc. Blindfolds are a common part of bedroom play. The restrained partner may then be sexually stimulated by masturbation, manual sex, oral sex, a vibrator, intercourse or other sex acts. Bondage can also be used for purposes other than sexual foreplay, for example, it may be used in erotic tickling or for sexual teasing.

The free partner may derive erotic pleasure or achieve sexual arousal from being in a dominant situation, while the tied partner may achieve arousal from being in a largely &quot;helpless&quot; position in the hands of a trusted partner. Either way, the partners are usually acting out their sexual fantasies.

In 1995, psychologists Kurt Ernulf and Sune Innala from Sweden published an analysis based on answers from members of the bondage-oriented Usenet group &quot;alt.sex.bondage&quot;. Most of the answers (76%) were from men. In 71% of the answers, the active (restraining) role in bondage was played by heterosexual men, 11% by heterosexual women and 12% by homosexual men. 29% of the heterosexual men, 89% of the heterosexual women and 88% of the homosexual men played the passive (restrained) role. A third of the people who answered said they practised bondage in connection with sadomasochistic activities or at least thought bondage and sadomasochism belonged together.

In a survey of American students conducted by a magazine in 1996, 24% of the people who replied claimed to have sexual fantasies involving bondage. This was claimed by 40% of the homosexual and bisexual men, 32% of the lesbian and bisexual women, 24% of the heterosexual women and 21% of the heterosexual men. 48% of the lesbian and bisexual women, 34% of the homosexual and bisexual men, and 25% of the heterosexual men and women had had practical experiences of bondage. In a survey conducted in the US in 1985, about half of the men considered bondage erotic, but according to the 1993 publication &quot;Janus Report on Sexual Behavior&quot;, only 11% of the representatives had had practical experiences of bondage.

==Types==
Because of the diversity in its forms, bondage can be divided into various types based on its motivation.

===Bondage for a purpose===
This form of bondage is the best known in BDSM and denotes restraining the passive partner for an ulterior purpose, such as making them more accessible for a spanking session. Bondage for its own sake is not considered in this category.

===Decorative bondage===
In this form of bondage, the restrained partner is bound for a decorative purpose, to be used as an aesthetic object, for example for erotic photography, or a form of human furniture in a BDSM party.

===Torture bondage===

In this form of bondage, the restrained partner is purposefully bound in an uncomfortable or painful position, for example as a punishment in connection of a dominant/submissive sexual play. Almost any form of bondage, when the restrained partner is left tied up long enough, can be used as torture bondage. How long this punitive form of bondage is used varies greatly, however in bondage erotica such as John Willie&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Gwendoline&quot; or Japanese bondage photography, it is often extensive and long-lasting.

===Film bondage===
Film bondage is a form of completely non-violent bondage for aesthetic purposes only. In this form of bondage, the restrained partner is bound lightly and is capable of escaping without great effort.

===Meditative bondage===
This form of bondage is seldom used in Western bondage. However, in Japanese bondage (Japanese: ), it is an important aspect, possibly originally having evolved from a religious tradition, where the interest is in the restrained partner&#x27;s spiritual situation rather than their corporal situation.

==Public==
A subculture of gay men, sometimes called leathermen, were among the first groups to make obvious hints of their taste in bondage in public spaces. Other groups, including pansexual and heterosexual BDSM enthusiasts, later followed suit. Early public displays were mainly limited to the wearing of certain fashion items, such as collars and cuffs.

Over time, more explicit public displays arose. The most prominent examples are LGBT street fairs, such as the famous Folsom Street Fair. These events are few in number and highly controversial in most regions.

Exhibitionist displays are another manifestation of public bondage. They are typically undertaken by individuals who fetishize public displays of sex and sexuality. However, some exhibitionist bondage is done as a social or political statement. This could be an effort to raise awareness of alternative sexuality or a political metaphor for oppression.

BDSM clubs feature semi-public bondage. While the clubs and events are considered private, play parties feature open spaces where play occurs that allows other attendees to watch scenes in progress. Public play of this variety is more rooted in social activity and the safe space afforded by such clubs than exhibitionist fetishism.

==BDSM==
Bondage features prominently in BDSM scenes and sexual roleplay. It is the best-known aspect of BDSM even outside the BDSM scene, and does not require a BDSM-oriented sexual identity to practice. People who routinely engage in conventional sex sometimes become proficient in the technical aspects of tying their partners up.

Bondage has a sexual appeal to people of all sexes and all sexual orientations, in a switch, dominant (top) or submissive (bottom) role.

There are also some common fantasy settings in which bondage may be a component. These include:
* Rape, ravishment or abduction: The top fictitiously seizes or abducts the consenting bottom and has complete control.
* Dominance/submission: A training session occurs in which rewards for obedience and punishment for defiance are given. Erotic humiliation is usually involved.
* Predicament bondage: In it a person is restrained with an option of placing themself in one of a pair of uncomfortable positions, such that the person keeps shifting between the two positions from time to time.

Self-bondage is more complex, and may involve special techniques to apply bondage to oneself, and also to effect a release after a lapsed period of time. Self-bondage is also notably risky: see the safety notes below. 
A large variety of bondage equipment is available for use in BDSM scenes for a number of results. These include rope, straps, or harnesses which can be used to hold limbs together; spreader bars, X-frames which can be used to keep limbs apart; the body or limbs can be tied to an object, such as to chairs or stocks; the body may be suspended from another object, as in suspension bondage; or it may used to restrict normal movement, such as use of hobble skirts, handcuffs, or pony harness. Bondage may also be used to wrap the whole body or a part of it in bindings, such as cloth or plastic (saran wrap or cling film &quot;mummification&quot;) as well as sleepsack bondage.

One of the purposes of bondage in BDSM is to restrain a person (typically called the bottom) in a BDSM position. This may involve simply tying the hands together in front or behind. Other positions involve the use of a waist belt to anchor the hands to the front, back or sides. Other popular positions are the spread eagle, with the limbs splayed out and fastened by wrists and ankles to bedposts, door frame or some other anchoring point; the hogtie, which secures each wrist to its corresponding ankle behind the back (wider, padded restraints such as bondage cuffs are recommended for this); the balltie, which secures wrists to ankles, in front, with the knees drawn up to the chest; the crotch rope, which involves pulling a rope between the labia to apply pressure to the female genitals. Sometimes a knot is placed in the rope at the position of the clitoris to intensify the sensation. A crotch rope can also be used on males, either placing pressure directly on the scrotum or including a tie to capture the scrotum. Other positions include the reverse prayer position (not recommended unless the subject has flexible shoulders), and an over-arm tie, in which the arms are brought over the head, and the wrists fastened together behind the head and then by a length of rope, chain or strapping to a belt at the waist.

The types of restraints used in bondage include rope, which is often preferred because of its flexibility. Rigging, however, requires considerable skill and practice to do safely. Other types of restraints include chains, handcuffs, thumbcuffs and belly chains. Institutional restraints, such as straitjackets may be used in some roleplays, and purpose-made bondage gear, such as monogloves, sleepsacks, bondage hooks and bondage tables, are also available.

Some BDSM play parties offer &quot;bondage workshops&quot;, where couples, or people otherwise consenting with each other, can practice tying under the instruction and supervision of an experienced bondage rigger.

== Safety ==

Bondage is safer when conducted between sober, trusted partners who are fully aware of the risks involved and the precautions necessary to ensure safety, such as informed consent. Partners who are in committed relationships may have a greater basis for trusting each other. Performing acts in a supervised location, such as a dungeon, or with a group of trusted friends may also increase safety.

There is also a subculture of people who seek out others interested in bondage and pursue such activities with people who they do not know well. This subculture has given rise to the set of principles known as safe, sane and consensual.

===Precautions===
Safety precautions include:

* The use of a &quot;safeword&quot;, or some clear way for the subject to indicate genuine distress and a wish to discontinue, temporarily stop or vary the activities of the play. 
* Never leaving a bound person alone.
* Avoiding positions or restraints which may induce postural asphyxia.
* Making sure that the subject changes positions at least once an hour (to avoid circulation problems).
* Making sure that the subject can be released quickly in an emergency.
* Avoiding restraints which impair breathing (gags or hoods which block the mouth can become asphyxial hazards if the subject vomits or the nose becomes otherwise blocked).
* Remaining sober; alcohol and drugs should be avoided.
Accidents and lasting damage can generally be avoided by very simple security precautions and a rudimentary knowledge of the human anatomy. One very simple safety measure is to ask the subject every so often if they are all right. Another is to check body parts like hands and feet for numbness or coldness, which can happen if nerves have been pinched or blood circulation has been blocked. Another is to check for skin discoloration. Skin that does not get enough oxygen turns bluish. If blood can get in, but cannot get out because one of the veins has been blocked, that part of the body turns purple.

If the subject has been gagged or can otherwise not verbally communicate, a different form of the safeword is needed. For instance, they may hum a simple tune, or opening and closing one or both hands repeatedly, or releasing an object held in one hand (such as a rubber ball, or a scarf).

Suspension bondage by hanging upside-down can be especially risky. The danger most often associated with it is falling on your head. Other dangers include nerve compression, circulation problems and fainting due to increase in blood pressure.

===Preparations===
Some simple preparations may also be helpful:
* Food. It is common for people (especially those on diets) to faint during a long session. Having a regular meal beforehand is recommended; being fed small snacks during play may also help prevent fainting.
* Cutting tools. A pair of EMT scissors is recommended (useful for safely cutting rope and tape off skin).
* Keyed-alike padlocks, if chains are being used.

Scenes depicted in bondage photographs and videos are chosen for their visual appeal and fantasy value. Sometimes these positions are dangerous or cannot be maintained for more than a few minutes (i.e., &quot;don&#x27;t try this at home&quot;) such as inverted bondage or suspension from the wrists and ankles. In many cases they cannot be &quot;acted out&quot; with good results and are only for extremely physically fit and very experienced BDSM participants. Especially in highly artistic Japanese bondage, years of experience of bondage is required to avoid the risks.

Self-bondage carries a higher risk, particularly because it violates an important principle of bondage safety; to never leave a bound person alone. For the feeling of being tied up to be as authentic as possible, practitioners of self-bondage can use time-limit clocks, freeze their keys in blocks of ice, or use self-invented devices, in order to temporarily abandon power over their own restraint and freedom (called &quot;tunnel play&quot;).

Without someone to release them in the event of an emergency or medical crisis, self-bondage can lead to severe and permanent physical damage. Especially in combination with asphyxiation, self-bondage can be lethal to its practitioners.

==Techniques==

Bondage techniques can be divided into six main categories:
* Binding body parts, such as arms or legs, together.
* Spreading out body parts, such as arms or legs.
* Binding the restrained partner to an outside object, such as a Saint Andrew&#x27;s cross, a chair, or a table.
* Suspending the restrained partner.
* Hindering or slowing down the movement of the restrained partner, such as with a hobble skirt or a corset.
* Wrapping the restrained partner up in soft, elastic material, thus restraining their entire body. This is known as mummification.

Many people feel that bondage must be &quot;rough and tough&quot;, as seen in many images of bondage erotica, but this is not always true. In so-called &quot;soft bondage&quot;, the active partner can simply hold the restrained partner&#x27;s hands together with their own hands, handcuff the restrained partner, or simply order the restrained partner not to move their hands, without using any physical restraint. This latter case, called &quot;verbal bondage&quot;, appeals to many people and is far more common than most people think.

A popular variant of bondage considers the artistic and aesthetic part of tying a person up more than the transfer of power and control, or the sexual pleasure. This type of bondage is called &quot;shibari&quot; or &quot;kinbaku&quot;, and comes originally from Japanese bondage. Shibari / kinbaku can be practiced either in the traditional Japanese way or in conjunction with Western bondage.

===Terms used in bondage===
In the American-European bondage scene, specific terms have developed for different kinds of bondage. The terms most often used in the European bondage subculture are in English, although some bondage term come from the Japanese language, such as &quot;kata&quot; (bondage position) or &quot;musubime&quot; (bondage knot). Examples of simple bondage techniques are the &quot;spread eagle&quot;, where the restrained partner&#x27;s each limb is tied to a different corner of a bed, or the &quot;hogtie&quot;, where the restrained partner&#x27;s hands and feet are both tied, and the ropes tying these are connected with each other, holding the restrained partner in a bent position. A &quot;crotch rope&quot; is sometimes used, where a rope is passed between the partner&#x27;s legs, applying pressure to the genitals.

==Materials==
Just about any material that can be used to hinder or restrain a person&#x27;s movement can be used in bondage. Bondage can be performed with everyday objects or specially designed BDSM equipment.

In less BDSM-oriented vanilla bondage everyday objects, such as silk scarves, stockings, neckties and belts are often used. Soft objects such as these can also be used for binding in front of the restrained partner&#x27;s eyes, temporarily blinding them.

&quot;Verbal bondage&quot; is bondage without physical restraint; the subject is simply given orders not to move, or only move in a restrained fashion. The technique is sometimes known as &quot;honor bondage&quot;.

===Rope===

Rope bondage is perhaps the best known and most used form of bondage, and rope is very often used in bondage as a material for physical restraint. In the western world, almost any kind of rope can be used for bondage, such as cotton, artificial fibers, or other materials. However, in Japanese bondage (shibari), only ropes made of hemp or jute are usually used. In Japanese bondage, the rope is usually well prepared before it can be used, so that it becomes soft and easily bendable. Between bondage sessions, the rope is cleaned by washing it.

Regardless of the type of rope used for bondage, temporary superficial damage to the skin can appear where the rope has applied pressure, this is called &quot;rope burns&quot;. In emergency situations, EMT scissors provide a quick way to free the restrained partner, however this destroys the rope.

There are several forms of rope bondage:
; Rope wrapping: The rope is simply wrapped around the restrained partner&#x27;s upper body, or in some cases, his/her entire body.
; Rope weaving: A more complicated technique, where a rope is first wrapped around the restrained partner&#x27;s body in a zig-zag pattern, and then a second rope is woven around it.
; Double rope technique: The restrained partner is bound by two ropes at once, allowing decorative rope patterns to be applied quickly.
; Single rope technique: A sure technique, most often used in conjunction with sadomasochism, where the restrained partner is bound by only one rope.

===Metal===
Metal bondage involves the use of a wide range of metal devices (usually steel) such as handcuffs, legcuffs, thumbcuffs, hooks and chains, specifically designed erotic furniture such as bondage chairs, and complex bar linkages. The metal is often used in combination with other materials.

In contrast to the use of rope bondage to secure a body, metal bondage normally requires greater preparation, since more complex devices have either to be built or bought from a specialist. Chains are occasionally preferred to rope for suspension bondage due to their tensile strength and ability to hold heavy weights.

Metal bondage appeals to some people because of the material&#x27;s tough image and the fact that its physical hardness makes it difficult to struggle or escape from. The cold sensation and clanking sound of chains provides auditory and tactile sensory stimulation and can be used to enhance the atmosphere of a BDSM dungeon.

===Leather, latex and polish===
Products made of leather are often used in bondage because of their flexibility and resistance to tearing. Because leather is easy to acquire, care for and work upon, it is one of the most popular materials for home-made bondage items. Many people have a fetish for leather, latex and polish and use these materials in connection with bondage, for example for cuffs, belts or neck bands. There are special bondage skirts, trousers or sacks made of these materials, as well as clothing and equipment for BDSM role play that can be used in connection with bondage. For example, harnesses are used in pony play, but would not be used without the corresponding role play.

===Other materials===
Plastic cable ties are also sometimes used as a quick way to tie someone up securely. These ties can leave burn marks on the skin when applied too tightly, and because of their durability and resistance to struggling, must be handled carefully when applied to joints or being left in place for a longer time.

== Bondage erotica ==
Some people regard bondage to be erotically stimulating or sexually arousing. Bondage features in some sexual fantasy scenarios. Bondage themes are present in some erotica and pornography.

Bondage pornography for heterosexual men almost overwhelmingly depicts bound women, rather than bound men, despite the fact that one of the most common fantasies in both sexes is being bound.

After George W. Bush&#x27;s 2000 election, there was concern within the pornography industry regarding possible future U.S. Justice Department prosecution over obscene material. In 2001, Paul Cambria was commissioned by adult entertainment company Vivid Entertainment to create a list of sex acts that pornography film producers should avoid filming, in order to prevent possible legal problems with the U.S. government; it became known as &quot;The Cambria List&quot;. The PBS series &quot;Frontline&quot; in their 2002 program &quot;American Porn&quot; revealed some of the items on the list, which included anything other than very light bondage. However, as of 2019, the Cambria List is generally regarded as obsolete within the pornography industry.

Bondage fantasies often involve dressing in a role outfit. Typical outfits for the submissive person invoke common icons of passivity or sexual innocence (e.g. a shepherdess, nun or schoolgirl outfit for women, or a leather slave harness and cuffs, thong, or ancient slave outfit for men). In a similar respect, the dominant person&#x27;s attire often reflect images of power, control, and extreme discipline (a Nazi officer, military officer, police or prison warden uniform).

In bondage erotica, metal chains are often associated with historical torture and prison scenarios.

Examples of bondage erotica include Anne Desclos&#x27;s &quot;Story of O&quot; (published under the pen name Pauline Réage), Frank E. Campbell&#x27;s books and the artwork of Robert Bishop.

==In art==

Bondage is depicted in erotic art, such as some of the works of Gustave Doré and John Everett Millais. The mythical Andromeda was a popular subject for bondage in art by painters including Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;Andromeda Chained to the Rocks&quot; (1630), Théodore Chassériau (1840), Edward Poynter (1869) and Gustave Doré (1869).

Another popular scenario for bondage in art was that of Angelica from the 15th century epic poem &quot;Orlando Innamorato&quot;, which is itself a continuation of the romantic epic saga &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;, which is similar to that of Andromeda in that the heroine is offered as a sacrifice to the sea gods. The traditional damsel in distress theme, also found in bondage art, was used in the motion picture serial &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot; (1914), which found Pearl White in mortal danger on a weekly basis.

Depictions of bondage in art may be erotic, in which case they follow a heteronormative model and tend to depict a young woman in danger and fear. Examples can be found in &quot;Bizarre&quot;, which was a fetish and bondage magazine published between 1946 and 1959 by bondage artist John Willie. It included drawings and photographs using professional models in bondage or sadomasochistic scenes.

Sweet Gwendoline was the main female character in John Willie&#x27;s works, and possibly the most famous bondage icon after Bettie Page. Sweet Gwendoline was repeatedly depicted as the stereotypical naïve blonde damsel in distress. A serial about that character was published in Robert Harrison&#x27;s mainstream girlie magazine &quot;Wink&quot; from June 1947 to February 1950 and later in several other magazines over the years. Bettie Page was the first famous bondage model. Specifically, from late 1951 or early 1952 through 1957, she posed for photographer Irving Klaw for mail-order photographs with pin-up and BDSM themes, making her the first famous bondage model.

==In popular culture==
Bondage received a positive (if brief) treatment in &quot;The Joy of Sex&quot;, a mainstream sex manual popular in the 1970s.

&quot;The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty&quot; was an erotic trilogy published in the 1980s by Anne Rice which contained bondage scenarios, as part of a wide range of BDSM acts.

A table in Larry Townsend&#x27;s &quot;The Leatherman&#x27;s Handbook II&quot; (the 1983 second edition; the 1972 first edition did not include this list) which is generally considered authoritative states that a grey handkerchief is a symbol for bondage in the handkerchief code, which is employed usually among gay male casual-sex seekers or BDSM practitioners in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. Wearing the handkerchief on the left indicates the top, dominant, or active partner; right the bottom, submissive, or passive partner. However, negotiation with a prospective partner remains important because, as Townsend noted, people may wear hankies of any color &quot;only because the idea of the hankie turns them on&quot; or &quot;may not even know what it means&quot;.

By the 1990s, references to bondage could be found in mainstream prime-time television series such as &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, where equipment such as handcuffs or collars and concepts such as the safeword were included as a matter of course.

The publication of Madonna&#x27;s book, &quot;Sex&quot; (1992), which included photographs of bound nudes, did a great deal to improve public awareness of the acceptance of bondage.

The &quot;Fifty Shades&quot; trilogy by E.L. James was first published in ebook in 2011 and subsequently went on to become a bestseller. The print edition of the first book, &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;, was published in 2012 and became the fastest selling bestseller, breaking multiple sales records. The trilogy revolves entirely around a fictional BDSM relationship, though it is widely considered a poor representation of BDSM relationships by those in the BDSM scene.

<text>The Wyperfeld National Park is the third-largest national park in Victoria, Australia, located in the Mallee district, approximately north-west of Melbourne. The national park was declared in 1921 and has been expanded significantly since, to protect of mallee, woodland, and heathland. Along with the Hattah-Kulkyne National Park, Murray-Sunset National Park, Lake Albacutya Park and Murray-Kulkyne Park, Wyperfeld National Park is managed as part of the Victorian Mallee Parks.

==History==
Like most of north-western Victoria, Wyperfeld was a shallow sea from about 25 million years ago until fairly recent times. The current landforms took shape as the sea gradually retreated from 40,000 to 15,000 years ago, leaving a vast expanse of sandy sediment which formed into sand dunes as it dried. 

Before European settlement, a network of ephemeral lakes in the area filled and emptied, on average, about every 20 years, typically remaining dry for about half that period. More recently, agricultural irrigation and drainage projects in the surrounding areas have cut off a significant part of Wyperfeld&#x27;s water supply. Consequently, the lakes have not been completely filled since 1975, and had drained again just two years later.

==Environment==
In good years, the Wimmera River fills Lake Hindmarsh to the south of the park, which overflows along Outlet Creek and then fills Lake Albacutya to the immediate south of the park. Given sufficient rain in the catchment, the water flows further north into Wyperfeld itself, forming a series of smaller lakes, which support rich floral and faunal communities based around black box and river red gum. Despite downstream flooding in 2011, the park has seen no inflow of water for many years.

The reserve is part of the Wyperfeld, Big Desert and Ngarkat Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for the conservation of malleefowl and other species of mallee birds.

<text>Yarra Ranges National Park is located in the Central Highlands of Australia&#x27;s southeastern state, Victoria, roughly 107 km (66.5 mi) northeast of Melbourne. Established in 1995, and managed by the statutory authority Parks Victoria, the park features a carbon-rich, temperate rainforest as well as a subalpine, eucalypt-dominant forest on its northern plateau. The park is home to large groves of mountain ash (&quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot;), the tallest species of tree in Australia, and among the tallest in the world, with specimens reaching 80 metres (262 ft) in height. A wide diversity of flora, fauna and fungi (nearly 6,000 documented species on iNaturalist.org) make their home across the park&#x27;s 76,003 hectares, including iconic Australian species such as bandicoots, echidnas, kangaroos, koalas, platypuses, possums, sugar and greater gliders, wallabies and wombats. There are nearly 200 documented species of birds in the area, with at least 60 herpetofaunal (reptile and amphibian) species, thousands of invertebrates and worms, over 900 types of fungi and mushrooms, and over 1,000 plant species. Among the conservation challenges facing Yarra Ranges National Park are climate change and invasive species of weeds, as well as the interaction of native species with non-native, introduced invasive animals, such as European hares and rabbits, domestic sheep, feral cats and dogs, red foxes, South Asian sambar deer, and European red and fallow deer. 

In winter, Lake Mountain, located on the plateau at the northern end of the park, provides cross-country skiing on both groomed and ungroomed ski trails. 

== Description ==
The Yarra Ranges National Park was created in December 1995, and spans 76,003 hectares within Victoria&#x27;s Central Highlands. This National Park has been given &quot;the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Category 2 (National Parks) of the United Nations List of National Parks and Protected Areas&quot;. By being category 2, it means that the park is primarily managed for the ecosystem conservation and appropriate recreation within it. The park is made up of wet Mountain Ash Forest and Cool Temperate Rainforest, as well as a diverse range of flora and fauna species. Mount Donna Buang, standing 1,245 metres above the town of Warburton is the parks largest mountain. The park encompasses the headwaters of the Yarra, O&#x27;Shannassy and Taggerty Rivers, as well as their reservoirs, which make up 70% of Melbourne&#x27;s water supply. This is because 84% of the park is within the Designated Water Supply Catchment Area (DWSCA) which is managed under the Government&#x27;s Closed Catchment Policy. Because of this, much of the park has limited access to the public to better protect the water supply catchments.

== Ecology ==
Victoria&#x27;s Mountain Ash trees (&quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot;) are among the most spectacular trees in the world being one of the world&#x27;s tallest tree species, as well as the tallest flowering plant. 

The Mountain ash trees have a lifespan of 400 years and tower up to 90 metres, though have been known to grow taller with the highest ever recorded being the &quot;Ferguson Tree,&quot; discovered near Healesville in 1872 standing at over 154 metres high. They grow in stands that have the highest above-ground biomass of any trees in the world, allowing them to store large quantities of carbon dioxide. In 2009, a study was conducted by Professor Brendan Mackey of the Australian National University, who found that Mountain Ash forests are the best in the world at locking up carbon, storing 1,867 tonnes of carbon per hectare. Once they have reached the end of their lifespan, their dead tree stumps and fallen logs continue to provide homes for at least 40 hollow-dependant species, including Victoria&#x27;s faunal emblem – the endangered Leadbeater&#x27;s Possum (&quot;Gymnobelideus leadbeateri&quot;) – as well as the Mountain Brushtail Possum (&quot;Trichosurus cunninghami&quot;) and the Greater Glider (Petauroides volans). There have also been nine epiphyte species that have been observed growing on the Mountain Ash trees, the most prevalent of these being Liverwort (&quot;Bazzania adnexa&quot;). Other than Mountain Ash trees, the park also contains several threatened species of flora, including the Slender Tree Fern (&quot;Cyathea cunninghamii&quot;). 
The park provides a habitat for many native species of fauna. There are over 120 recorded species of native birds, with some notable species being the Pink Robin (&quot;Petroica rodinogaster&quot;), Yellow-tailed black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus funereus), Australian King Parrot (&quot;Alisterus scapularis&quot;) and the Grey Goshawk (&quot;Accipiter novaehollandiae&quot;). The park also contains three species of threatened owl – Sooty Owl (&quot;Tyto tenebricosa&quot;), Powerful Owl (&quot;Ninox strenua&quot;) and the Barking Owl (&quot;Ninox connivens&quot;). Native mammals that are frequently seen within the park are Kangaroos, Wallabies and Wombats. The waterways are abundant with Platypuses, as well as many species of fish, including Redfin perch (&quot;Perca fluviatillis&quot;), European carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;) and Golden perch (&quot;Macquaria ambigua&quot;). When it comes to insects, Mount Doona Buang is home to an endemic rare species known as the Mount Donna Buang Wingless Stonefly (&quot;Riekoperla darlingtoni&quot;).

== Environmental threats ==

=== Weeds and feral animals ===
One of the most major environmental threats against the Yarra Ranges National Park is invasive weeds. The park is rich with native plants that are being overcome by competition by the 200 species of weeds that are spreading into the park from private gardens. In the park there are three significant types of weeds:
*Weeds of National Significance (WONS) are plants that have the most significant impacts across Australia both environmentally and economically, and are a priority for control. In the Yarra Ranges National Park some WONS are Willow (&quot;Salix&quot; app.), Blackberry (&quot;Rubus fruticosus&quot; spp.aggregate), Boneseed (&quot;Chrysanthemoides monilifera&quot;) and Bridal Creeper (&quot;Asparagus asparagoides&quot;).
*Native species as weeds. There are some Australian native species that can have weed characteristics when they grow outside of their normal range and can cause harm to the park&#x27;s environment. Some native weeds in the park are Bluebell Creeper (&quot;Billardieria heterophylla&quot;), Cedar Wattle (&quot;Acacia elata&quot;) and Cootamundra Wattle (&quot;Acacia baileyana&quot;).
*Declared Noxious Weeds. These plants have been declared noxious under the Catchment and Land Protection Act 1994. These plants have the potential to cause serious environmental harm and therefore must be managed. Ragwort (&quot;Senecio jacobaea&quot;), Spear Thistle (&quot;Cirsium vulgare&quot;) and Hawthorn (&quot;Crataegus monogyna&quot;) are all declared noxious weeds.

Invasive pest animals can have detrimental effects on the park because they prey on native wildlife and can &quot;out-compete and displace native animals by competing for their habitat, food and water resources&quot;. Red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) are an established pest animal in all of Victoria. When it comes to the Yarra Ranges National Park, mainly trapping methods are employed to manage the issue. In Victoria there is a program that rewards eligible Victorian hunters with a $10 bounty reward for each individual fox killed, subject to the Victorian Fox Bounty Terms and Conditions. Due to this, and the amount of foxes in the park, Parks Victoria opens up the park occasionally to allow hunters in to help manage the fox issue. Other pest animals within the park are European Rabbits (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;) and feral cats.

=== Fires ===
Fires are a natural part of Australian environment because they are needed for the renewal of ecosystems; however, in recent times these bushfires have been occurring outside normal frequencies, intensities, seasons and scale of what fauna and flora can tolerate. To reduce the potential impact of fire on the park, controlled burns are conducted throughout specific months of the year and are carefully managed by Parks Victoria and the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP). The controlled burns are used to reduce the amount of fuel, such as dead wood, leaf litter, bark or shrubs that could easily catch alight during the summer months. A reduced amount of fuel decreases the impact of a bushfire because it lowers its intensity.

=== Climate change ===
Climate change is having a major impact on all ecosystems within Australia, and the Yarra Ranges National Park is no exception. As the temperature increases, the average rainfall decreases, meaning less water flowing in the waterways. Less water reduces water quality that is supplied to Melbourne and used by the fauna and flora within the park. The annual surface temperature is predicted to increase by 0.6-1C and wind speed is set to increase by 6%. All these changes will impact what makes up the park&#x27;s ecosystem and how it functions.

==Heritage==
European colonists found it difficult to access the area. It was eventually settled in 1860 and was seen as a valuable area for timber. Soon after, the area was recognised as a good place for water catchments, so the Maroondah and Upper Yarra dams were built.

== Management ==
Yarra Ranges National Park is managed by Parks Victoria, the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) and Melbourne Water. Parks Victoria released a Management Plan for the park in 2002 in which they outlined the significant management directions for the Park, all of which are still used today.

Parks Victoria aims to preserve significant conservation areas by; 
Preserving old-growth forests, as well as specific significant flora species. Parks will do this by improving knowledge of flora in the park by encouraging flora surveys and research on significant species to improve conservation management schemes for specific species. To provide special protection for significant plant species by actively managing threatening processes, such as weed invasion. To protect the parks native fauna species and maintain genetic diversity. This will be done by maintaining and enhancing fauna habitat through the control of potentially threatening processes, such as pest plant and animal control. To encourage surveys of fauna and faunal habitats in the park, giving priority to threatened species to ensure that the park continues to support viable populations of each endangered species. The last management strategy to protect fauna species is to communicate the policy of no feeding of wildlife in the park, and to prohibit the distribution and sale of birdseed within the park. When it comes to fire management, Parks Victoria allows open days for locals to come into the park and gather wood. This helps to get rid of fire fuel that is present in the understory of the forest.

Protecting water resources in the water supply catchments. This will be done by maintaining the Restricted Access Policy for the Designated Water Supply Catchment Area (DWSCA), by continuing to prohibit domestic pets and control feral animals in the DWSCA to protect the water resources from any potential forms of contamination. The DWSCA will also be protected from wildfire in accordance with the Draft Yarra Ranges National Park Fire Protection Plan. The last management strategy to protect the water supply catchments is to monitor the effects of roads and traffic that transverse the DWSCA to ensure that there is minimal soil erosion that could affect the water supply.

== Are the management directions effective? ==
The current management strategies outlined in the Yarra Ranges National Park Management Plan regarding the Restricted Access Policy, is efficient at maintaining the parks water resources. By limiting human access to the Designated Water Supply Catchment Area (DWSCA) it prevents some forms of contaminants from entering the supply catchments because the area remains clear of rubbish. If rubbish left behind in the park by people entered the water catchments, it could have a damaging effect on the purity of the water that is supplied to Melbourne. The restriction on people feeding wildlife has also benefited the native species within the park because it allows the ecosystem to function and evolve without human interference.

One of the main reasons the park was established was to protect Mountain Ash trees, however, their numbers have declined due to climate change, bush fires and close-proximity logging to the park. Climate change cannot be prevented, but significant fire damage can be. To decrease the severity of fires within the Park, more planned burns to get rid of a majority of fire fuel could be implemented by Parks Victoria and DELWP. When it comes to close-proximity logging, the effect on Mountain Ash trees is detrimental. To help prevent the further loss of these endangered carbon-rich forests, a policy could be implement by the Victorian Government to prevent logging from occurring within a 20 kilometre area of the park.

With the number of Mountain Ash trees decreasing, faunal habitat is also being lost. This is of great concern when it comes to Victoria&#x27;s faunal emblem – the Leadbeater&#x27;s Possum, as well as many other threatened species of fauna within the park. Parks Victoria and DELWP have management strategies in place that do protect these threatened species from pest species and human interaction, however there are no measures to combat the increased threat of climate change. When it comes to protecting threatened species of fauna, there are breeding programs implemented in Healesville Sanctuary to increase specific species population rates. Once these animals reach a certain age, Zoo&#x27;s Victoria coordinates their efforts with the Parks Ranger, to release these animals into the park. In regards to faunal habitat being lost, the parks open wood days may be displacing animals if people do not stick to the restriction for wood collection in the park. This cannot be managed, so the only way to prevent this is to find a way to manage it, or to stop the open wood days altogether.

To help better protect endangered fauna and flora within the area, there is a proposal for the creation of the Great Forest National Park. This proposed park will add 355,000 hectares to existing parks and reserves. The proposed park will supply over 4 million people with some of the highest quality drinking water, help to protect a greater portion of Mountain Ash forest and provide a greater area for protecting endangered and rare wildlife. Overall, the proposed park will protect approximately all of Victoria&#x27;s Central Highlands.

<text>Robert Hofstadter (February 5, 1915 – November 17, 1990) was an American physicist. He was the joint winner of the 1961 Nobel Prize in Physics (together with Rudolf Mössbauer) &quot;for his pioneering studies of electron scattering in atomic nuclei and for his consequent discoveries concerning the structure of nucleons&quot;.

== Biography ==
Hofstadter was born in New York City on February 5, 1915, to Polish Jewish immigrants Louis Hofstadter, a salesman, and Henrietta, née Koenigsberg. He attended elementary and high schools in New York City and entered City College of New York, graduating with a B.S. degree &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1935 at the age of 20, and was awarded the Kenyon Prize in Mathematics and Physics. He also received a Charles A. Coffin Foundation Fellowship from the General Electric Company, which enabled him to attend graduate school at Princeton University, where he earned his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees at the age of 23. His doctoral dissertation was titled &quot;Infra-red absorption by light and heavy formic and acetic acids.&quot; He did his post-doctoral research at the University of Pennsylvania and was an assistant professor at Princeton before joining Stanford University. Hofstadter taught at Stanford from 1950 to 1985.
In 1942 he married Nancy Givan (1920–2007), a native of Baltimore. They had three children: Laura, Molly (who was disabled and not able to communicate), and Pulitzer Prize-winner Douglas Hofstadter.

==Opus==
===Thallium-activated sodium iodide gamma ray detector===
In 1948 Hofstadter filed a patent on this for the detection of ionizing radiation by this crystal. These thallium-activated sodium iodide detectors are widely used for gamma ray detection to this day.

===Coining of the fermi (unit) and 1961 Nobel Lecture===

Robert Hofstadter coined the term fermi, symbol fm,
in honor of the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi (1901–1954), one of the founders of nuclear physics, in Hofstadter&#x27;s 1956 paper published in the &quot;Reviews of Modern Physics&quot; journal, &quot;Electron Scattering and Nuclear Structure&quot;. The term is widely used by nuclear and particle physicists. When Hofstadter was awarded the 1961 Nobel Prize in Physics, it subsequently appeared in the text of his 1961 Nobel Lecture, &quot;The electron-scattering method and its application to the structure of nuclei and nucleons&quot; (December 11, 1961).

===Compton Gamma Ray Observatory and EGRET Telescope===
In his last few years, Hofstadter became interested in astrophysics and applied his knowledge of scintillators to the design of the EGRET gamma-ray telescope of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory named for fellow Nobel Laureate in Physics (1927), Arthur Holly Compton. Stanford University&#x27;s Department of Physics credits Hofstadter with being &quot;one of the principal scientists who developed the Compton Observatory.&quot;

<text>James Patrick Page (born 9 January 1944) is an English musician and producer who achieved international success as the guitarist and founder of the rock band Led Zeppelin. Prolific in creating guitar riffs, Page&#x27;s style involves various alternative guitar tunings and melodic solos, coupled with aggressive, distorted guitar tones. It is also characterized by his folk and eastern-influenced acoustic work. He is notable for occasionally playing his guitar with a cello bow to create a droning sound texture to the music.

Page began his career as a studio session musician in London and, by the mid-1960s, alongside Big Jim Sullivan, was one of the most sought-after session guitarists in Britain. He was a member of the Yardbirds from 1966 to 1968. When the Yardbirds broke up, he founded Led Zeppelin, which was active from 1968 to 1980. Following the death of Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham, he participated in a number of musical groups throughout the 1980s and 1990s, more specifically XYZ, the Firm, the Honeydrippers, Coverdale–Page, and Page and Plant. Since 2000, Page has participated in various guest performances with many artists, both live and in studio recordings, and participated in a one-off Led Zeppelin reunion in 2007 that was released as the 2012 concert film &quot;Celebration Day&quot;. Along with the Edge and Jack White, he participated in the 2008 documentary &quot;It Might Get Loud&quot;.

Page is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential guitarists of all time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine has described Page as &quot;the pontiff of power riffing&quot; and ranked him number three in their 2015 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;, behind Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton, and ranking 3rd again in 2023 behind Chuck Berry and Jimi Hendrix. In 2010, he was ranked number two in Gibson&#x27;s list of &quot;Top 50 Guitarists of All Time&quot; and, in 2007, number four on &quot;Classic Rock&quot;″s &quot;100 Wildest Guitar Heroes&quot;. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice: once as a member of the Yardbirds (1992) and once as a member of Led Zeppelin (1995).
== Early life ==
Page was born to James Patrick Page and Patricia Elizabeth Gaffikin in the west London suburb of Heston on 9 January 1944. His father was a personnel manager at a plastic-coatings plant and his mother, who was of Irish descent, was a doctor&#x27;s secretary. In 1952, they moved to Feltham, and then to Miles Road, Epsom, in Surrey. Page was educated from the age of eight at Epsom County Pound Lane Primary School, and when he was eleven he went to Ewell County Secondary School in West Ewell. He came across his first guitar, a Spanish guitar, in the Miles Road house: &quot;I don&#x27;t know whether [the guitar] was left behind by the people [in the house] before [us], or whether it was a friend of the family&#x27;s—nobody seemed to know why it was there.&quot; First playing the instrument when aged 12, he took a few lessons in nearby Kingston, but was largely self-taught:

When I grew up there weren&#x27;t many other guitarists ... There was one other guitarist in my school who actually showed me the first chords that I learned and I went on from there. I was bored so I taught myself the guitar from listening to records. So obviously it was a very personal thing.

This &quot;other guitarist&quot; was a boy called Rod Wyatt, a few years his senior, and together with another boy, Pete Calvert, they would practise at Page&#x27;s house; Page would devote six or seven hours on some days to practising and would always take his guitar with him to secondary school, only to have it confiscated and returned to him after class. 
Among Page&#x27;s early influences were rockabilly guitarists Scotty Moore and James Burton, who both played on recordings made by Elvis Presley. Presley&#x27;s song &quot;Baby Let&#x27;s Play House&quot; is cited by Page as being his inspiration to take up the guitar, and he would reprise Moore&#x27;s playing on the song in the live version of &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; on &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;. He appeared on BBC1 in 1957 with a Höfner President acoustic, which he&#x27;d bought from money saved up from his milk round in the summer holidays and which had a pickup so it could be amplified, but his first solid-bodied electric guitar was a second-hand 1959 Futurama Grazioso, later replaced by a Fender Telecaster, a model he had seen Buddy Holly playing on the TV and a real-life example of which he&#x27;d played at an electronics exhibition at the Earls Court Exhibition Centre in London.

Page&#x27;s musical tastes included skiffle (a popular English music genre of the time) and acoustic folk playing, and the blues sounds of Elmore James, B.B. King, Otis Rush, Buddy Guy, Freddie King, and Hubert Sumlin. &quot;Basically, that was the start: a mixture between rock and blues.&quot;

At the age of 13, Page appeared on Huw Wheldon&#x27;s &quot;All Your Own&quot; talent quest programme in a skiffle quartet, one performance of which aired on BBC1 in 1957. The group played &quot;Mama Don&#x27;t Want to Skiffle Anymore&quot; and another American-flavoured song, &quot;In Them Ol&#x27; Cottonfields Back Home&quot;. When asked by Wheldon what he wanted to do after schooling, Page said, &quot;I want to do biological research [to find a cure for] cancer, if it isn&#x27;t discovered by then.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine, Page stated that &quot;there was a lot of busking in the early days, but as they say, I had to come to grips with it and it was a good schooling.&quot; When he was fourteen, and billed as James Page, he played in a group called Malcolm Austin and Whirlwinds, alongside Tony Busson on bass, Stuart Cockett on rhythm and a drummer named Tom, playing Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis numbers. This band was short-lived, as Page soon found a drummer for a band he&#x27;d previously been playing in with Rod Wyatt, David Williams and Pete Calvert, and came up with a name for them: The Paramounts. The Paramounts played gigs in Epsom, once supporting a group who would later become Johnny Kidd &amp; the Pirates.

Although interviewed for a job as a laboratory assistant, he ultimately chose to leave secondary school in West Ewell to pursue music, doing so at the age of fifteen – the earliest age permitted at the time – having gained four GCE O levels and on the back of a major row with the school Deputy Head Miss Nicholson about his musical ambitions, about which she was wholly scathing.

Page had difficulty finding other musicians with whom he could play on a regular basis. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t as though there was an abundance. I used to play in many groups ... anyone who could get a gig together, really.&quot; Following stints backing recitals by Beat poet Royston Ellis at the Mermaid Theatre between 1960 and 1961, and singer Red E. Lewis, who&#x27;d seen him playing with the Paramounts at the Contemporary club in Epsom and told his manager Chris Tidmarsh to ask Page to join his backing band, the Redcaps, after the departure of guitarist Bobby Oats, Page was asked by singer Neil Christian to join his band, the Crusaders. Christian had seen a fifteen-year-old Page playing in a local hall, and the guitarist toured with Christian for approximately two years and later played on several of his records, including the 1962 single, &quot;The Road to Love&quot;.

During his stint with Christian, Page fell seriously ill with glandular fever and could not continue touring. While recovering, he decided to put his musical career on hold and concentrate on his other love, painting, and enrolled at Sutton Art College in Surrey. As he explained in 1975:

== Career ==
=== Early 1960s: session musician ===
While still a student, Page often performed on stage at the Marquee Club with bands such as Cyril Davies&#x27; All Stars, Alexis Korner&#x27;s Blues Incorporated, and fellow guitarists Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton. He was spotted one night by John Gibb of Brian Howard &amp; the Silhouettes, who asked him to help record some singles for Columbia Graphophone Company, including &quot;The Worrying Kind&quot;. Mike Leander of Decca Records first offered Page regular studio work. His first session for the label was the recording &quot;Diamonds&quot; by Jet Harris and Tony Meehan, which went to Number 1 on the singles chart in early 1963.

After brief stints with Carter-Lewis and the Southerners, Mike Hurst and the Method and Mickey Finn and the Blue Men, Page committed himself to full-time session work. As a session guitarist, he was known as &#x27;Lil&#x27; Jim Pea&#x27; to prevent confusion with the other noted English session guitarist Big Jim Sullivan. Page was mainly called into sessions as &quot;insurance&quot; in instances when a replacement or second guitarist was required by the recording artist. &quot;It was usually myself and a drummer&quot;, he explained, &quot;though they never mention the drummer these days, just me ... Anyone needing a guitarist either went to Big Jim [Sullivan] or myself.&quot; He stated that &quot;In the initial stages they just said, play what you want, cos at that time I couldn&#x27;t read music or anything.&quot;

Page was the favoured session guitarist of record producer Shel Talmy. As a result, he secured session work on songs for the Who and the Kinks. Page is credited with playing acoustic twelve-string guitar on two tracks on the Kinks&#x27; debut album, &quot;I&#x27;m a Lover Not a Fighter&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Driving on Bald Mountain&quot;, and possibly on the B-side &quot;I Gotta Move&quot;. He played rhythm guitar on the sessions for the Who&#x27;s first single &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot; (although Pete Townshend was reluctant to allow Page&#x27;s contribution on the final recording; Page also played lead guitar on the B-side, &quot;Bald Headed Woman&quot;). Page&#x27;s studio gigs in 1964 and 1965 included Marianne Faithfull&#x27;s &quot;As Tears Go By&quot;, Jonathan King&#x27;s &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Gone to the Moon&quot;, the Nashville Teens&#x27; &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;, the Rolling Stones &quot;Heart of Stone&quot; (along with &quot;We&#x27;re Wasting Time&quot;) (also, Van Morrison &amp; Them&#x27;s &quot;Baby, Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, &quot;Mystic Eyes&quot;, and &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot;, Dave Berry&#x27;s &quot;The Crying Game&quot; and &quot;My Baby Left Me&quot;, Brenda Lee&#x27;s &quot;Is It True&quot;, Shirley Bassey&#x27;s &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, and Petula Clark&#x27;s &quot;Downtown&quot;.

In 1964, Page contributed guitar to the incidental music of the Beatles&#x27; 1964 film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;.

In 1965, Page was hired by Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham to act as house producer and A&amp;R man for the newly formed Immediate Records label, which allowed him to play on and/or produce tracks by John Mayall, Nico, Chris Farlowe, Twice as Much and Clapton. Also in 1965, Page produced one of Dana Gillespie&#x27;s early singles, &quot;Thank You Boy&quot;. Page also formed a brief songwriting partnership with then romantic interest Jackie DeShannon. He composed and recorded songs for the John Williams (not to be confused with the film composer John Williams) album &quot;The Maureeny Wishful Album&quot; with Big Jim Sullivan. Page worked as session musician on Donovan Leitch&#x27;s &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot;, on Engelbert Humperdinck&#x27;s &quot;Release Me&quot;, the Johnny Hallyday albums &quot;Jeune homme&quot; and &quot;Je suis né dans la rue&quot;, the Al Stewart album &quot;Love Chronicles&quot; and played guitar on five tracks of Joe Cocker&#x27;s debut album, &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;. Over the years since 1970, Page played lead guitar on 10 Roy Harper tracks, comprising 81 minutes of music.

When questioned about which songs he played on, especially ones where there exists some controversy as to what his exact role was, Page often points out that it is hard to remember exactly what he did given the enormous number of sessions he was playing at the time. In a radio interview, he explained that &quot;I was doing three sessions a day, fifteen sessions a week. Sometimes I would be playing with a group, sometimes I could be doing film music, it could be a folk session ... I was able to fit all these different roles.&quot;

Although Page recorded with many notable musicians, many of these early tracks are only available as bootleg recordings, several of which were released by the Led Zeppelin fan club in the late 1970s. Examples include early jam sessions featuring him and guitarists Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton covering various blues themes, which were included on compilations released by Immediate Records. Several early tracks were compiled on the twin album release, &quot;Jimmy Page: Session Man&quot;. He also recorded with Keith Richards on guitar and vocals in Olympic Sound Studios on 15 October 1974. Along with Ric Grech on bass and Bruce Rowland on drums, a track called &quot;Scarlet&quot; was cut (the same year he played acoustic guitar on The Stones&#x27; &quot;Through the Lonely Nights&quot;). Page reflected later in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Cameron Crowe: &quot;I did what could possibly be the next Stones B side. It was Ric Grech, Keith and me doing a number called &quot;Scarlet&quot;. I can&#x27;t remember the drummer. It sounded very similar in style and mood to those &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; tracks. It was great, really good. We stayed up all night and went down to Island Studios where Keith put some reggae guitars over one section. I just put some solos on it, but it was eight in the morning of the next day before I did that. He took the tapes to Switzerland and someone found out about them. Richards told people that it was a track from my album&quot;.

Page left studio work when the increasing influence of Stax Records on popular music led to the greater incorporation of brass and orchestral arrangements into recordings at the expense of guitars. He stated that his time as a session player served as extremely good schooling:
=== Late 1960s: The Yardbirds ===
In late 1964, Page was approached about the possibility of replacing Eric Clapton in the Yardbirds, but he declined out of loyalty to his friend. In February 1965, Clapton quit the Yardbirds and Page was formally offered his spot, but unwilling to give up his lucrative career as a session musician and worried about his health under touring conditions, he suggested his friend Jeff Beck. On 16 May 1966, drummer Keith Moon, bass player John Paul Jones, keyboardist Nicky Hopkins, Jeff Beck and Page recorded &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; in London&#x27;s IBC Studios. The experience gave Page an idea to form a new supergroup featuring Beck, along with The Who&#x27;s John Entwistle on bass and Moon on drums. However, the lack of a quality vocalist and contractual problems prevented the project from getting off the ground. During this time, Moon suggested the name &quot;Lead Zeppelin&quot; for the first time, after Entwistle commented that the proceedings would take to the air like a lead balloon.

Within weeks, Page attended a Yardbirds concert at Oxford. After the show, he went backstage where Paul Samwell-Smith announced that he was leaving the group. Page offered to replace Samwell-Smith, and this was accepted by the group. He initially played electric bass with the Yardbirds before finally switching to twin lead guitar with Beck when Chris Dreja moved to bass. The musical potential of the line-up was scuttled, however, by interpersonal conflicts caused by constant touring and a lack of commercial success, although they released one single, &quot;Happenings Ten Years Time Ago&quot;. While Page and Beck played together in the Yardbirds, the trio of Page, Beck and Clapton never played in the original group at the same time. The three guitarists did appear on stage together at the ARMS Charity Concerts in 1983.

After Beck&#x27;s departure, the Yardbirds remained a quartet. They recorded one album with Page on lead guitar, &quot;Little Games&quot;. The album received indifferent reviews and was not a commercial success, peaking at number 80 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Though their studio sound was fairly commercial at the time, the band&#x27;s live performances were just the opposite, becoming heavier and more experimental. These concerts featured musical aspects that Page would later perfect with Led Zeppelin, most notably performances of &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;.

After the departure of Keith Relf and Jim McCarty in 1968, Page reconfigured the group with a new line-up to fulfill unfinished tour dates in Scandinavia. To this end, Page recruited vocalist Robert Plant and drummer John Bonham, and he was also contacted by John Paul Jones, who asked to join. During the Scandinavian tour, the new group appeared as the New Yardbirds, but soon recalled the old joke by Keith Moon and John Entwistle. Page stuck with that name to use for his new band. Manager Peter Grant changed it to &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot;, to avoid a mispronunciation as &quot;&quot;Leed Zeppelin&quot;.&quot;

=== 1968–1980: Led Zeppelin ===

Led Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music groups in the history of audio recording. Various sources estimate the group&#x27;s worldwide sales at more than 200 or even 300 million albums. With 111.5 million RIAA-certified units, they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums reached the top 10 of the US Billboard album chart, and six reached the number-one spot.

Led Zeppelin were the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock, and their sound was largely the product of Page&#x27;s input as a producer and musician. The band&#x27;s individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences. They performed on multiple record-breaking concert tours, which also earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band&#x27;s output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties of the members.

Page explained that he had a very specific idea in mind as to what he wanted Led Zeppelin to be, from the very beginning:
Led Zeppelin broke up in 1980 following the death of Bonham at Page&#x27;s home. Page initially refused to touch a guitar, grieving for his friend. For the rest of the 1980s, his work consisted of a series of short-term collaborations in the bands the Firm, the Honeydrippers, reunions and individual work, including film soundtracks. He also became active in philanthropic work.

===1980s===

Page made a return to the stage at a Jeff Beck show in March 1981 at the Hammersmith Odeon. Also in 1981, Page joined with Yes bassist Chris Squire and drummer Alan White to form a supergroup called XYZ (for former Yes-Zeppelin). They rehearsed several times, but the project was shelved. Bootlegs of these sessions revealed that some of the material emerged on later projects, notably The Firm&#x27;s &quot;Fortune Hunter&quot; and Yes songs &quot;Mind Drive&quot; and &quot;Can You Imagine?&quot;. Page joined Yes on stage in 1984 at Westfalenhalle in Dortmund, Germany, playing &quot;I&#x27;m Down&quot;.

In 1982, Page collaborated with director Michael Winner to record the &quot;Death Wish II&quot; soundtrack. This and several subsequent Page recordings, including the &quot;Death Wish III&quot; soundtrack, were recorded and produced at his recording studio, The Sol in Cookham, which he had purchased from Gus Dudgeon in the early 1980s.

In 1983, Page appeared with the A.R.M.S. (Action Research for Multiple Sclerosis) charity series of concerts which honoured Small Faces bassist Ronnie Lane, who suffered from the disease. For the first shows at the Royal Albert Hall in London, Page&#x27;s set consisted of songs from the &quot;Death Wish II&quot; soundtrack (with Steve Winwood on vocals) and an instrumental version of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;. A four-city tour of the United States followed, with Paul Rodgers of Bad Company replacing Winwood. During the tour, Page and Rodgers performed &quot;Midnight Moonlight&quot;, which would later appear on The Firm&#x27;s first album. All of the shows featured an on stage jam of &quot;Layla&quot; that reunited Page with Beck and Clapton. According to the book &quot;Hammer of the Gods&quot;, it was reportedly around this time that Page told friends that he had just ended seven years of heroin use. On 13 December 1983, Page joined Plant on stage for one encore at the Hammersmith Odeon in London.

Page next linked up with Roy Harper for the 1984 album &quot;Whatever Happened to Jugula?&quot; and occasional concerts, performing a predominantly acoustic set at folk festivals under various guises such as the MacGregors and Themselves. Also in 1984, Page recorded with Plant as the Honeydrippers the album &quot;The Honeydrippers: Volume 1&quot; and with John Paul Jones on the film soundtrack &quot;Scream for Help&quot;.

Page subsequently collaborated with Rodgers on two albums under the name The Firm. The first album, released in 1985, was the self-titled &quot;The Firm&quot;. Popular songs included &quot;Radioactive&quot; and &quot;Satisfaction Guaranteed&quot;. The album peaked at number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop albums chart and went gold in the US. It was followed by &quot;Mean Business&quot; in 1986. The band toured in support of both albums, but soon split up.

Various other projects followed, such as session work for Graham Nash, Stephen Stills and the Rolling Stones (on their 1986 single &quot;One Hit (To the Body)&quot;). In 1986, Page reunited temporarily with his former Yardbirds bandmates to play on several tracks of the Box of Frogs album &quot;Strange Land&quot;. Page released a solo album entitled &quot;Outrider&quot; in 1988, which featured contributions from Plant, with Page contributing in turn to Plant&#x27;s solo album &quot;Now and Zen&quot;, which was released the same year. &quot;Outrider&quot; also featured singer John Miles on the album&#x27;s opening track &quot;Wasting My Time&quot;.

Throughout these years, Page also reunited with the other former bandmates of Led Zeppelin to perform live on a few occasions, most notably in 1985 for the Live Aid concert with both Phil Collins and Tony Thompson filling drum duties. However, the band members considered this performance to be sub-standard, with Page having been let down by a poorly tuned Les Paul. Page, Plant and Jones, as well as John Bonham&#x27;s son Jason, performed at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary show on 14 May 1988, closing the 12-hour show.

=== 1990s: Coverdale–Page, Page and Plant ===
In 1990, a Knebworth concert to aid the Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy Centre and the British School for Performing Arts and Technology saw Plant unexpectedly joined by Page to perform &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot;, &quot;Wearing and Tearing&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;. The same year, Page appeared with Aerosmith at the Monsters of Rock festival. Page also performed with the band&#x27;s former members at Jason Bonham&#x27;s wedding. In 1993, Page collaborated with David Coverdale (of English rock band Whitesnake) for the album &quot;Coverdale–Page&quot; and a brief tour of Japan.

In 1994, Page and Robert Plant reunited as &quot;Page and Plant&quot; for an initial performance as part of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Unplugged&quot; series. The 90-minute special, dubbed &quot;Unledded&quot;, premiered to the highest ratings in MTV&#x27;s history. In October of the same year, the session was released as the live album &quot;No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded&quot;, and on DVD as &quot;No Quarter Unledded&quot; in 2004. Following a highly successful mid-1990s tour to support &quot;No Quarter&quot;, Page and Plant recorded 1998&#x27;s &quot;Walking into Clarksdale&quot;, featuring the Grammy Award-winning songs &quot;Most High&quot; and &quot;Please Read the Letter&quot;.

Page was heavily involved in remastering the Led Zeppelin catalogue. He participated in various charity concerts and charity work, particularly the &quot;Action for Brazil&#x27;s Children Trust&quot; (ABC Trust), founded by his wife Jimena Gomez-Paratcha in 1998. 

In the same year, Page played guitar for rap singer/producer Puff Daddy&#x27;s song &quot;Come with Me&quot;, which heavily samples Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Kashmir&quot; and was included in the soundtrack of &quot;Godzilla&quot;. The two later performed the song on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

Following a benefit performance in the summer where the Black Crowes guested with him, Page teamed up with the band for six shows in October 1999, playing material from the Led Zeppelin catalogue and old blues and rock standards. The last two concerts were recorded in Los Angeles and released as a double live album, &quot;Live at the Greek&quot; in 2000.

===2000s===
Following the release of the live album, Page and the Black Crowes continued their collaboration by joining a package tour with the Who in 2000, which Page ultimately quit before completion.

In 2001, after guesting with Fred Durst and Wes Scantlin&#x27;s performance of &quot;Thank You&quot; at the MTV Europe Video Music Awards, Page once again continued his collaboration with Robert Plant. After recording a cover of &quot;My Bucket&#x27;s Got a Hole in It&quot; for a tribute album, the duo performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival.

In 2005, Page was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in recognition of his Brazilian charity work for Task Brazil and Action For Brazil&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Trust, made an honorary citizen of Rio de Janeiro later that year and won a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award with Led Zeppelin.

In November 2006, Led Zeppelin was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame. The television broadcasting of the event consisted of an introduction to the band by various famous admirers (including Roger Taylor, Slash, Joe Perry, Steven Tyler, Jack White and Tony Iommi), an award presentation to Page and a short speech by him. After this, rock group Wolfmother played a tribute to Led Zeppelin. During an interview for the BBC in connection with the induction, Page expressed plans to record new material in 2007, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s an album that I really need to get out of my system ... there&#x27;s a good album in there and it&#x27;s ready to come out&quot; and &quot;Also there will be some Zeppelin things on the horizon.&quot;

On 10 December 2007, the surviving members of Led Zeppelin, as well as John Bonham&#x27;s son, Jason Bonham played a charity concert at the O2 Arena London. According to &quot;Guinness World Records 2009&quot;, Led Zeppelin set the world record for the &quot;Highest Demand for Tickets for One Music Concert&quot; as 20 million requests for the reunion show were rendered online. On 7 June 2008, Page and John Paul Jones appeared with the Foo Fighters to close the band&#x27;s concert at Wembley Stadium, performing &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; and &quot;Ramble On&quot;. On 20 June 2008, at a ceremony at Guildford Cathedral, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Surrey. For the 2008 Summer Olympics, Page, David Beckham and Leona Lewis represented Britain during the closing ceremonies on 24 August 2008. Beckham rode a double-decker bus into the stadium, and Page and Lewis performed &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot;.
In 2008, Page co-produced a documentary film directed by Davis Guggenheim entitled &quot;It Might Get Loud&quot;. The film examines the history of the electric guitar, focusing on the careers and styles of Page, The Edge and Jack White. The film premiered on 5 September 2008 at the Toronto International Film Festival. Page also participated in the three-part BBC documentary &quot;London Calling: The making of the Olympic handover ceremony&quot; on 4 March 2009. On 4 April 2009, Page inducted Jeff Beck into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Page announced his 2010 solo tour while talking to Sky News on 16 December 2009.

===2010s===
In January 2010, Page announced an autobiography published by Genesis Publications, in a hand-crafted, limited edition of 2,150 copies. Page was honoured with a first-ever Global Peace Award by the United Nations&#x27; Pathways to Peace organisation after confirming reports that he would be among the headliners at a planned Show of Peace Concert in Beijing, on 10 October 2010.

On 3 June 2011, Page played with Donovan at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The concert was filmed. Page made an unannounced appearance with The Black Crowes at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London on 13 July 2011. He also played alongside Roy Harper at Harper&#x27;s 70th-birthday celebratory concert, in London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall on 5 November 2011.
In November 2011, British Conservative MP Louise Mensch launched a campaign to have Page knighted for his contributions to the music industry. In December 2012, Page, along with Plant and Jones, received the annual Kennedy Center Honors from President Barack Obama in a White House ceremony. The honour is the U.S.&#x27;s highest award for those who have influenced American culture through the arts. In February 2013, Plant hinted that he was open to a Led Zeppelin reunion in 2014, stating that he is not the reason for the band&#x27;s dormancy, saying &quot;Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones are quite contained in their own worlds and leave it to [him]&quot;, adding that he is &quot;not the bad guy&quot; and that he has &quot;got nothing to do in 2014.&quot;

In 2013, Page (with Led Zeppelin) was awarded a Grammy Award &quot;Best Rock Album&quot; for &quot;Celebration Day&quot;.

In May 2014, Page was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Berklee College of Music in Boston. In a spring 2014 interview with the BBC about the then forthcoming reissue of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s first three albums, Page said he was confident fans would be keen on another reunion show, but Plant later replied that &quot;the chances of it happening [were] zero.&quot; Page then told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he was &quot;fed up&quot; with Plant&#x27;s refusal to play, stating &quot;I was told last year that Robert Plant said he is doing nothing in 2014, and what do the other two guys think? Well, he knows what the other guys think. Everyone would love to play more concerts for the band. He&#x27;s just playing games, and I&#x27;m fed up with it, to be honest with you. I don&#x27;t sing, so I can&#x27;t do much about it&quot;, adding, &quot;I definitely want to play live. Because, you know, I&#x27;ve still got a twinkle in my eye. I can still play. So, yeah, I&#x27;ll just get myself into musical shape, just concentrating on the guitar.&quot;

In July 2014, an &quot;NME&quot; article revealed that Plant was &quot;slightly disappointed and baffled&quot; by Page in ongoing Led Zeppelin dispute during which Page declared he was &quot;fed up&quot; with Plant delaying Led Zeppelin reunion plans. Instead, Plant offered Led Zeppelin&#x27;s guitarist to write acoustically with him as he is interested in working with Page again but only in an unplugged way.

In September 2014, Page – who has not toured as a solo act since 1988 – announced that he would start a new band and perform material spanning his entire career. He spoke about his prospects for hitting the road, saying: &quot;I haven&#x27;t put [musicians] together yet but I&#x27;m going to do that next year [i.e. 2015]. If I went out to play, I would play material that spanned everything from my recording career right back to my very, very early days with The Yardbirds. There would certainly be some new material in there as well ...&quot;.

In December 2015, Page was featured in the two-hour long BBC Radio 2 programme &quot;Johnny Walker Meets&quot;, in conversation with DJ Johnny Walker. In October 2017, Page spoke at the Oxford Union about his career in music.

=== 2020s ===
Page is among the people interviewed for the documentary film &quot;If These Walls Could Sing&quot; directed by Mary McCartney about the recording studios at Abbey Road.

== Legacy ==
Page is considered – by musical peers – one of the greatest and most influential guitarists. His experiences in the studio and with the Yardbirds were key to the success of Led Zeppelin. As a producer, songwriter and guitarist, he helped make Zeppelin a prototype for countless bands and was one of the major driving forces behind the rock sound of that era, influencing a host of guitarists.

Guitarists influenced by Page include Eddie Van Halen, Ace Frehley, Joe Satriani, John Frusciante, Kirk Hammett, Joe Perry, Richie Sambora, Slash, Dave Mustaine, Mick Mars, Alex Lifeson, Steve Vai, Dan Hawkins, and Char, among others. John McGeoch was described as &quot;the new wave Jimmy Page&quot; by &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine.

Queen&#x27;s Brian May told &quot;Guitarist&quot; in 2004: &quot;I don&#x27;t think anyone has epitomised riff writing better than Jimmy Page—he&#x27;s one of the great brains of rock music.&quot;

&quot;If Jimmy Page would play guitar with me,&quot; remarked Stevie Nicks, &quot;I&#x27;d put a band around us tomorrow.&quot;

== Equipment and techniques ==

===Guitars===
For the recording of most of Led Zeppelin material from Led Zeppelin&#x27;s second album onwards, Page used a Gibson Les Paul guitar (sold to him by Joe Walsh) with Marshall amplification. A Harmony Sovereign H-1260 was used in-studio on &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; and &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; and on-stage from 5 March 1971 to 28 June 1972. During the studio sessions for &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot; and later for recording the guitar solo in &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, he used a Fender Telecaster (a gift from Jeff Beck). He also used a Danelectro 3021, tuned to DADGAD, most notably on live performances of &quot;Kashmir&quot;.

Page also plays his guitar with a cello bow, as on the live versions of the songs &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; and &quot;How Many More Times&quot;. This was a technique he developed during his session days. On MTV&#x27;s &quot;Led Zeppelin Rockumentary&quot;, Page said that he obtained the idea of playing the guitar with a bow from David McCallum, Sr. who was also a session musician. Page used his Fender Telecaster and later his Gibson Les Paul for his bow solos.

====Notable guitars====
;6-string electric guitars

*1959 Fender Telecaster (The Dragon). Given to Page by Jeff Beck and repainted with a psychedelic dragon design by Page. Played with the Yardbirds. Used to record the first Led Zeppelin album and used on the early tours during 1968–69. In 1971, it was used for recording the &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; solo. It was later disassembled and parts used in other guitars.
*1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard (No. 1). Sold to Page by Joe Walsh for $500. This guitar was also used by Gibson as the model for the company&#x27;s second run of Page signature models in 2004. Produced by Gibson and aged by luthier Tom Murphy, this second generation of Page tribute models was limited to 25 guitars signed by Page himself; and only 150 guitars in total for the aged model issue.
*1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard (No. 2) with a shaved-down neck to match the profile on his No. 1. He added four push/pull pots to coil split the humbuckers as well as phase and series switches which were added under the pick guard after the break-up of Led Zeppelin. Used primarily as an alternate-tuning guitar (DADGAD) and as a back-up for his No. 1 guitar.
*1969 Gibson Les Paul DeLuxe (No. 3). Seen in &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; during the theremin/solo section of &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; and for &quot;Kashmir&quot; at the O2 reunion concert. In 1985, the guitar was fitted with a Parsons-White B-string bender and used extensively by Page from the mid-to-late 1980s onward, including the Outrider tour and the Page/Plant &quot;Unledded&quot; special on MTV.
*1969 Gibson Les Paul Deluxe. Used only for &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; during the 1977 North American tour. Slightly different from the Les Paul Deluxe (No. 3) due to its smaller headstock and thin cutaway binding. Refinished in a solid brick-red paint.
*1991 Gibson Les Paul Custom Shop. English luthier Roger Giffin built a guitar for Page-based loosely on Page&#x27;s No. 2. Giffin&#x27;s work was later copied for Gibson&#x27;s original run of Jimmy Page Signature model Les Pauls in the mid-1990s.
*1961 Danelectro 3021. Tuned to DADGAD and used live for &quot;White Summer&quot;, &quot;Black Mountain Side&quot;, &quot;Kashmir&quot; and &quot;Midnight Moonlight&quot; with The Firm. Also tuned to open G live for &quot;In My Time of Dying&quot;.
*1958 Danelectro 3021. Tuned to open G and used on the Outrider tour. This one has a smaller pickguard, as opposed to the large &quot;seal&quot; pickguard on his 1961 Danelectro.
*1960 Black Gibson Les Paul Custom (with Bigsby tremolo) – stolen in 1970. Page ran an ad requesting the return of this highly modified instrument but the guitar was not recovered until 2015–2016. In 2008 the Gibson Custom Shop produced a limited run of 25 re-creations of the guitar, each with a Bigsby tremolo and a new custom six-way toggle switch.
*1953 Botswana Brown Fender Telecaster featuring a Parsons and White B-string bender, originally with a maple neck, and later refitted with the rosewood neck originally from the &quot;Dragon Telecaster&quot;. Seen primarily during the 1980s since it was one of his main guitars on stage during The Firm and &quot;Outrider&quot; era. Also used on the Led Zeppelin&#x27;s 1977 North American concert tour and at Knebworth in 1979, notably on &quot;Ten Years Gone&quot; and &quot;Hot Dog&quot;.
*1964 Lake Placid Blue Fender Stratocaster. Used during recording sessions for &quot;In Through the Out Door&quot;, at Earls Court in 1975, Knebworth in 1979 and the Tour Over Europe 1980 for &quot;In the Evening&quot;.
*1966 Cream Fender Telecaster (used on &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; and on &quot;All My Love&quot; during the Tour Over Europe in 1980).

;12-string electric guitars

*1967 black Vox Phantom 12-string used during the recording for the Yardbirds album &quot;Little Games&quot; and for onstage appearances. This was also the electric twelve-string guitar used to record &quot;Travelling Riverside Blues&quot; on the BBC Sessions and it was used to record &quot;Thank You&quot; and &quot;Living Loving Maid (She&#x27;s Just A Woman)&quot; on &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot;.
*1965 Fender Electric XII (12-String) used to record &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;, &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; and &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot;.

;Acoustic guitars

*1963 Gibson J-200, used to record acoustic parts for &quot;Led Zeppelin I&quot;. It was loaned to Page by its owner, Big Jim Sullivan, and returned to him after recording the album. Page would later own a re-issue built to the same specs as the 1963 model.
*1972 Martin D-28, used to record acoustic songs after &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;, used live at Earls Court in 1975
*Harmony Sovereign H-1260 (year unknown), used on &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot;, for the acoustic intro to &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, and in live shows from 1970 to 1972.
*1970 Giannini Craviola twelve-string acoustic used in recording &quot;Tangerine&quot; and in live performances of the same.

;Multi-neck guitars

*1971 Gibson EDS-1275. Used during live concerts for playing &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;, &quot;The Rain Song&quot;, &quot;Celebration Day&quot; (1971, 1972, and 1979 performances), &quot;Tangerine&quot; (1975 Earls Court shows) and &quot;Sick Again&quot; (1977 North American tour). Jimmy Page says: &quot;My original idea for the opening tracks for &#x27;Houses Of The Holy&#x27; was that a short overture would be a rousing instrumental introduction with layered electric guitars that would segue in to &#x27;The Seasons&#x27;, later to be titled &#x27;The Rain Song&#x27;.&quot;
*In 1994 Andy Manson was commissioned to make another triple neck guitar for Page. It was used during the &quot;Unledded&quot; performances.

====Strings====
*Ernie Ball Super Slinky electric guitar strings .009s-.042s

====Signature models====
Gibson released a Jimmy Page Signature Les Paul, discontinued in 1999, then released another version in 2004, which was also discontinued. The 2004 version included 25 guitars signed by Page, 150 aged by Tom Murphy (an acknowledged ageing &quot;master&quot;) and 840 &quot;unlimited&quot; production guitars. The Jimmy Page Signature EDS-1275 has been produced by Gibson. Recently, Gibson reproduced Page&#x27;s 1960 Les Paul Black Beauty, the one stolen from him in 1970, with modern modifications. This guitar was sold in 2008 with a run of 25, again signed by Page, plus an additional 500 unsigned guitars.

In December 2009, Gibson released the &#x27;Jimmy Page &quot;Number Two&quot; Les Paul&#x27;. This is a re-creation of Page&#x27;s famous &quot;Number Two&quot; Les Paul used by him since about 1974. The model includes the same pick-up switching setup as devised by Page, shaved-down neck profile, Burstbucker pick-up at neck and &quot;Pagebucker&quot; at the bridge. A total of 325 were made in three finishes: 25 Aged by Gibson&#x27;s Tom Murphy, signed and played by Page ($26,000), 100 aged ($16,000) and 200 with VOS finish ($12,000).

In 2019, Fender released two signature models, both based on Page&#x27;s 1959 Telecaster (which he received as a gift from Jeff Beck):
* Page&#x27;s &quot;Mirror&quot; design, which features the guitar in a white blond finish with eight mirrors attached throughout the body.
* Page&#x27;s &quot;Dragon&quot; design. After the dissolution of the Yardbirds, Page removed the mirrors from the guitar, stripped the finish and applied a dragon design himself.

===Other instruments===
Theremin

Page frequently employed a scaled-down version of the Theremin known as the Sonic Wave, first using the instrument during live performances with the Yardbirds. As a member of Led Zeppelin, Page played the Sonic Wave on the studio recordings of &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; and &quot;No Quarter&quot;, and frequently played the instrument at the band&#x27;s live shows.

Hurdy-gurdy

Page owns two hurdy-gurdies, and is shown playing one of the instruments in the 1976 film &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;. The second hurdy-gurdy owned by Page was produced by Christopher Eaton, father of renowned English hurdy-gurdist Nigel Eaton.

===Amplifiers and effects===
Page usually recorded in studio with assorted amplifiers by Vox, Axis, Fender and Orange amplification. Live, he used Hiwatt and Marshall amplification. The first Led Zeppelin album was played on a Fender Telecaster through a Supro amplifier.

Page used a limited number of effects, including a Maestro Echoplex, a Dunlop Cry Baby, an MXR Phase 90, a Vox Cry Baby Wah, a Boss CE-2 Chorus, a Yamaha CH-10Mk II Chorus, a Sola Sound Tone Bender Professional Mk II, an MXR Blue Box (distortion/octaver) and a DigiTech Whammy.

===Music production techniques===

Page is credited for the innovations in sound recording he brought to the studio during the years he was a member of Led Zeppelin, many of which he had initially developed as a session musician:

This apprenticeship ... became a part of [learning] how things were recorded. I started to learn microphone placements and things like that, what did and what didn&#x27;t work. I certainly knew what did and didn&#x27;t work with drummers because they put drummers in these little sound booths that had no sound deflection at all and the drums would just sound awful. The reality of it is the drum is a musical instrument, it relies on having a bright room and a live room ... And so bit by bit I was learning really how &quot;not&quot; to record.

He developed a reputation for employing effects in new ways and trying out different methods of using microphones and amplification. During the late 1960s, most British music producers placed microphones directly in front of amplifiers and drums, resulting in the sometimes &quot;tinny&quot; sound of the recordings of the era. Page commented to &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine that he felt the drum sounds of the day in particular &quot;sounded like cardboard boxes.&quot; Instead, Page was a fan of 1950s recording techniques, Sun Studio being a particular favourite. In the same &quot;Guitar World&quot; interview, Page remarked: &quot;Recording used to be a science&quot; and &quot;[engineers] used to have a maxim: distance equals depth.&quot; Taking this maxim to heart, Page developed the idea of placing an additional microphone some distance from the amplifier (as much as twenty feet) and then recording the balance between the two. By adopting this technique, Page became one of the first British producers to record a band&#x27;s &quot;ambient sound&quot; – the distance of a note&#x27;s time-lag from one end of the room to the other.

For the recording of several Led Zeppelin tracks, such as &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; and &quot;You Shook Me&quot;, Page additionally utilised &quot;reverse echo&quot; – a technique which he claims to have invented himself while with the Yardbirds (he had originally developed the method when recording the 1967 single &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;). This production technique involved hearing the echo before the main sound instead of after it, achieved by turning the tape over and employing the echo on a spare track, then turning the tape back over again to get the echo preceding the signal.

Page has stated that, as producer, he deliberately changed the audio engineers on Led Zeppelin albums, from Glyn Johns for the first album, to Eddie Kramer for &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot;, to Andy Johns for &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; and later albums. He explained: &quot;I consciously kept changing engineers because I didn&#x27;t want people to think that they were responsible for our sound. I wanted people to know it was me.&quot;

John Paul Jones acknowledged that Page&#x27;s production techniques were a key component of the success of Led Zeppelin:

In an interview that Page himself gave to &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine in 1993, he remarked on his work as a producer:

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
During the 1960s Page was with American recording artist Jackie DeShannon, who is cited as a possible inspiration for the Page composition and Led Zeppelin recording &quot;Tangerine&quot;.

French model Charlotte Martin was Page&#x27;s partner from 1970 to about 1982 or 1983. Page called her &quot;My Lady&quot; and together they had a daughter, Scarlet Page (born in 1971), who is a photographer.

While touring with Led Zeppelin, Page&#x27;s view on groupies was described as &quot;the younger, the better,&quot; according to tour manager Richard Cole. For example, Page had a well-documented, one-year-long relationship with &quot;baby groupie&quot; Lori Mattix (also known as Lori Maddox), beginning when she was 14 or 15 and while he was 28. In light of the Me Too movement four decades later, their relationship attracted renewed attention.

From 1986 to 1995, Page was married to Patricia Ecker, a model and waitress. They have a son, James Patrick Page (born April 1988). Page later married Jimena Gómez-Paratcha, whom he met in Brazil on the No Quarter tour. He adopted her oldest daughter Jana (born 1994) and they have two children together: Zofia Jade (born 1997) and Ashen Josan (born 1999). Page and Gómez-Paratcha divorced in 2008.

Page has been in a relationship with actress and poet Scarlett Sabet, forty-five years his junior, since August 2014.

===Properties===
In 1967, when Page was still with The Yardbirds, he purchased the Thames Boathouse on the River Thames in Pangbourne, Berkshire and resided there until 1973. The Boathouse was also the place where Page and Plant first officially got together in the summer of 1968 and Led Zeppelin was formed.

In 1972, Page bought the Tower House from Richard Harris. It was the home that William Burges (1827–81) had designed for himself in London. &quot;I had an interest going back to my teens in the pre-Raphaelite movement and the architecture of Burges&quot;, Page said. &quot;What a wonderful world to discover.&quot; The reputation of Burges rests on his extravagant designs and his contribution to the Gothic revival in architecture in the nineteenth century.

From 1980 to 2004 Page owned the Mill House, Mill Lane, Windsor, which was formerly the home of actor Michael Caine. Fellow Led Zeppelin band member John Bonham died at the house in 1980.

From the early 1970s to the early 1990s, Page owned Boleskine House, the former residence of occultist Aleister Crowley. Sections of Page&#x27;s fantasy sequence in the film &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; were filmed at night on the mountainside directly behind Boleskine House.

Page also previously owned Plumpton Place in Sussex, formerly owned by Edward Hudson, the owner of &quot;Country Life&quot; magazine and with certain parts of the house designed by Edwin Lutyens. This house features in the Zeppelin film &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot; where Page is seen sitting on the lawn playing a hurdy-gurdy.

He currently resides in Sonning, Berkshire in Deanery Garden, a house also designed by Edwin Lutyens for Edward Hudson.

===Recreational drug use===
Page has acknowledged heavy recreational drug use throughout the 1970s. In an interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine in 2003, he stated: &quot;I can&#x27;t speak for the [other members of the band], but for me drugs were an integral part of the whole thing, right from the beginning, right to the end.&quot; After the band&#x27;s 1973 North American tour, Page told Nick Kent: &quot;Oh, everyone went over the top a few times. I know I did and, to be honest with you, I don&#x27;t really remember much of what happened.&quot;

In 1975, Page began to use heroin, according to Richard Cole. Cole claims that he and Page took the drug during the recording sessions of the album &quot;Presence,&quot; and Page admitted shortly afterward that he was addicted to the drug.

By Led Zeppelin&#x27;s 1977 North American tour, Page&#x27;s heroin addiction was beginning to hamper his guitar playing performances. By this time the guitarist had lost a noticeable amount of weight. His onstage appearance was not the only obvious change; his addiction caused Page to become so inward and isolated it altered the dynamics between him and Plant considerably. During the recording sessions for &quot;In Through the Out Door&quot; in 1978, Page&#x27;s diminished influence on the album (relative to bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones) is partly attributed to his heroin addiction, which resulted in his absence from the studio for long periods of time.

Page reportedly overcame his heroin habit in the early 1980s, although he was arrested for possession of cocaine in both 1982 and 1984. He was given a 12-month conditional discharge in 1982 and, despite a second offence usually carrying a jail sentence, he was only fined.

In a 1988 interview with &quot;Musician&quot; magazine, Page took offence when the interviewer noted that heroin had been associated with his name and insisted: &quot;Do I look as if I&#x27;m a smack addict? Well, I&#x27;m not. Thank you very much.&quot;

In an interview he gave to &quot;Q magazine&quot; in 2003, Page responded to a question as to whether he regrets getting so involved in heroin and cocaine:

===Interest in the occult===

Page&#x27;s interest in the occult started as a schoolboy at the age of fifteen, when he read English occultist&#x27;s Aleister Crowley&#x27;s &quot;Magick in Theory and Practice&quot;. He later said that following this discovery, he thought: &quot;Yes, that&#x27;s it. My thing: I&#x27;ve found it.&quot;
The appearance of four symbols on the jacket of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s fourth album has been linked to Page&#x27;s interest in the occult. The four symbols represented each member of the band. Page&#x27;s own so-called &quot;Zoso&quot; symbol originated in &quot;Ars Magica Arteficii&quot; (1557) by Gerolamo Cardano, an old alchemical grimoire, where it has been identified as a sigil consisting of zodiac signs. The sigil is reproduced in &quot;Dictionary of Occult, Hermetic and Alchemical Sigils&quot; by Fred Gettings.

During tours and performances after the release of the fourth album, Page often had the &quot;Zoso&quot; symbol embroidered on his clothes, along with zodiac symbols. These were visible most notably on his &quot;Dragon Suit&quot;, which included the signs for Capricorn, Scorpio and Cancer which are Page&#x27;s Sun, Ascendant and Moon signs, respectively. The &quot;Zoso&quot; symbol also appeared on Page&#x27;s amplifiers.

The artwork inside the album cover of &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; is from a painting attributed to the artist Barrington Colby, influenced by the traditional Rider/Waite Tarot card design for the card called &quot;The Hermit&quot;. Very little is known about Colby and rumours have persisted down the years that Page himself is responsible for the painting. Page transforms into this character during his fantasy sequence in Led Zeppelin&#x27;s concert film &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;.

In the early 1970s Page owned an occult bookshop and publishing house, The Equinox Booksellers and Publishers, at 4 Holland Street in Kensington, London, named after Crowley&#x27;s biannual magazine, &quot;The Equinox&quot;. The design of the interior incorporated Egyptian and Art Deco motifs, with Crowley&#x27;s birth chart affixed to a wall. Page&#x27;s reasons for setting up the bookshop were straightforward:
There was not one bookshop in London with a good collection of occult books and I was so pissed off at not being able to get the books I wanted.

The company published two books: a facsimile of Crowley&#x27;s 1904 edition of &quot;The Goetia&quot; and &quot;Astrology, A Cosmic Science&quot; by Isabel Hickey. The lease eventually expired on the premises and was not renewed. As Page said: &quot;It obviously wasn&#x27;t going to run the way it should without some drastic business changes, and I didn&#x27;t really want to have to agree to all that. I basically just wanted the shop to be the nucleus, that&#x27;s all.&quot;

Page has maintained a strong interest in Crowley for many years. In 1978, he explained:

Page was commissioned to write the soundtrack music for the film &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot; by Crowley admirer and underground movie director Kenneth Anger. Page ultimately produced 23 minutes of music, which Anger felt was insufficient because the film ran for 28 minutes and Anger wanted the film to have a full soundtrack. Anger claimed Page took three years to deliver the music and the final product was only 23 minutes of &quot;droning&quot;. The director also slammed the guitarist in the press by calling him a &quot;dabbler&quot; in the occult and an addict and being too strung out on drugs to complete the project. Page countered that he had fulfilled all his obligations, even going so far as to lend Anger his own film editing equipment to help him finish the project. Page released the Lucifer Rising music on vinyl in 2012 via his website on &quot;Lucifer Rising and other sound tracks&quot;. Side one contained &quot;Lucifer Rising – Main Track&quot;, whilst side two contained the tracks &quot;Incubus&quot;, &quot;Damask&quot;, &quot;Unharmonics&quot;, &quot;Damask – Ambient&quot;, and &quot;Lucifer Rising – Percussive Return&quot;. In the December 2012 Rolling Stone cover story &quot;Jimmy Page: The Rolling Stone Interview&quot;, Page said: &quot;... there was a request, suggesting that Lucifer Rising should come out again with my music on. I ignored it.&quot;

Although Page collected works by Crowley, he has never described himself as a Thelemite nor was he ever initiated into Ordo Templi Orientis. The Equinox Bookstore and Boleskine House were both sold off during the 1980s, as Page settled into family life and participated in charity work.

<doc id="102100" wikidata="Q232711" url="?curid=102100" title="Annika Sörenstam">
<text>Annika Charlotta Sörenstam (; born 9 October 1970) is a Swedish professional golfer regarded as one of the best female golfers in history. Before stepping away from competitive golf at the end of the 2008 season, she had won 96 international professional tournaments, making her the female golfer with the most wins to her name. She has won 72 official LPGA tournaments including ten majors and 24 other tournaments internationally. 

In 2003, she achieved a career grand slam, winning, at least once in her career, each of the four tournaments recognized as major championships during the main part of her career. In 2003, Sörenstam played in the Bank of America Colonial tournament to become the first woman to play in a PGA Tour event since 1945.

Representing Europe in the Solheim Cup on eight occasions between 1994 and 2007, Sörenstam was the event&#x27;s all-time leading points earner until her record was surpassed by England&#x27;s Laura Davies during the 2011 Solheim Cup. Sörenstam also was captain of the 2017 European Solheim Cup team.

Despite retiring from regular tournament golf in 2008, as of the end of 2022, she still topped the LPGA&#x27;s career money list with earnings of over $22 million—over $2 million ahead of her nearest rival while playing 187 fewer events. After turning 50, she came back from her retirement and added a win in the 2021 U.S. Senior Women&#x27;s Open.

The winner of a record eight Player of the Year awards, and six Vare Trophies given to the LPGA player with the lowest seasonal scoring average, she still holds various all-time scoring records including the lowest season scoring average: 68.6969 in 2004. Sörenstam is the only female golfer to shoot a 59 in competition.

On 7 January 2021, she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Donald Trump.

==Childhood and amateur career==
She was born in Bro near Stockholm, Sweden. Sörenstam&#x27;s father Tom was an IBM executive and her mother Gunilla worked in a bank. Her younger sister Charlotta also became a professional golfer and LPGA Tour winner, and, after her playing career, coached at her sister&#x27;s academy. Annika and Charlotta Sörenstam became the first two sisters to both win $1 million on the LPGA Tour.

As a child, Sörenstam was a talented all-around athlete. She was a nationally ranked junior tennis player, played association football (soccer) in her hometown team Bro IK, and was such a good skier that the coach of the Swedish national ski team suggested the family move to northern Sweden to improve her skiing year round.

===Junior golf===
The Sörenstam family began playing golf at Viksjö Golf Club in Jakobsberg, north of Stockholm, and later switched to nearby Bro-Bålsta Golf Club, opened in 1980, initially with a 9-hole course. At the age of 12, Annika shared her first set of golf clubs with her sister. Annika got the odd numbered clubs and Charlotta the even - and earned her first handicap of 54.

At the European Tour tournament Scandinavian Enterprise Open in Stockholm in July 1986, she tried to be a volunteer caddie and was asked to stand in a line with all other candidates. When all male volunteer caddies finally had been chosen by the tournament professionals, three teen-age girls were left without a bag yet. It was Annika, Charlotta and Fanny Sunesson.

She was so shy as a junior, she used to deliberately three-putt at the end of a tournament to avoid giving the victory speech. The coaches noticed and at the next tournament both the winner and the runner-up had to give a speech. Sörenstam decided that if she were going to have to face the crowd anyway she might as well win and the deliberate misses stopped.

===Swedish national team===
Her successful amateur career included a win in the St Rule Trophy played at St Andrews and a runner-up finish in the Swedish national mother/daughter Championship. As a member of the Swedish National Team from 1987 to 1992, she played in the 1990 and 1992 Espirito Santo Trophy, winning the individual competition in 1992. While waiting to start college in Sweden, Sörenstam worked as a personal assistant at the Swedish PGA and played on the Swedish Golf Tour, winning three tournaments during 1990/1991.

===University of Arizona===
After a coach spotted Sörenstam playing in a collegiate event in Tokyo, she moved to the U.S. to play college golf at the University of Arizona in Tucson. She won seven collegiate titles and in 1991, became the first non-American and first freshman to win the individual NCAA Division I Championship. Sörenstam was 1991 NCAA Co-Player of the Year with Kelly Robbins, runner-up in the 1992 NCAA championship, 1992 Pac-10 champion and a 1991–92 NCAA All-American. She qualified for the U.S. Women&#x27;s Open at Oakmont in July, made the cut, and tied for 63rd. A few weeks later at the U.S. Women&#x27;s Amateur at Kemper Lakes near Chicago, she was the runner-up to Vicki Goetze, bogeying the last hole in the 36-hole final.

==Professional career==

===1990s===
Sörenstam turned professional in 1992, but missed her LPGA Tour card at the final qualifying tournament by one shot, and began her professional career on the Ladies European Tour (LET), formerly known as the WPGET. She was invited to play in three LPGA Tour events in 1993, where she finished T38th, 4th, and T9th, earning more than $47,000. She finished second four times on the Ladies European Tour and was 1993 Ladies European Tour Rookie of the Year. By tying for 28th at the LPGA Final Qualifying Tournament she earned non-exempt status for the 1994 season. Sörenstam&#x27;s first professional win came at the 1994 Holden Women&#x27;s Australian Open on the ALPG Tour.

In the United States, Sörenstam was LPGA Rookie of the Year, had three top-10 finishes including a tie for second at the Women&#x27;s British Open and made her Solheim Cup debut. Her breakout year was 1995, when she won her first LPGA Tour title at the U.S. Women&#x27;s Open. She finished at the top of the Money List and was the first non-American winner of the Vare Trophy. She became the second player ever to be Player of the Year and Vare Trophy winner the year after being Rookie of the Year. A win at the 1995 Australian Ladies Masters and two other wins on the Ladies European Tour put her top of the LET Order of Merit and made her the first player to top both the European and LPGA Tour money lists in the same season. Her success worldwide resulted in her winning the Jerringpriset award in Sweden, as well as being awarded the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal, the country&#x27;s most prestigious award in sports.

1996 saw Sörenstam win her home LET tournament, the Trygg Hansa Ladies&#x27; Open in Sweden and three LPGA tournaments including the U.S. Women&#x27;s Open. In defending her title, she became the first non-American to win back to back U.S. Women&#x27;s Open titles, passed the $1 million mark in LPGA career earnings, and won her second consecutive Vare Trophy.

She won six tour events in 1997, regaining the money list and player of the year titles. Internationally, she won on the JLPGA and defended her home LET title at the renamed Compaq Open. She became the first player in LPGA history to finish a season with a sub-70 scoring average of 69.99 en route to retaining the 1998 Player of the Year and Money List titles as well as winning the LET Swedish tour stop for the third time running. September 1999 saw Sörenstam change her on-course team replacing her caddie of six years, Colin Cann, with Terry McNamara.

===2000s===
At this point in her career, Sörenstam says she lost focus having reached her biggest goals. Karrie Webb became the best LPGA Tour player but Sörenstam still managed to win more LPGA tournaments than any other LPGA Tour player during the 1990s. She qualified for the World Golf Hall of Fame when she won the 2000 Welch&#x27;s/Circle K Championship, but was not eligible for induction until finishing her tenth year on the LPGA tour in October 2003. Sörenstam was the first international player to be inducted into the Hall of Fame through the LPGA criteria.

Having lost her preeminent position, Sörenstam embarked on a new five-day-a-week exercise program including weight-lifting and balance work which by 2003 added over to her driving distance. During the 2001 season, she had eight LPGA wins, became the only female golfer to shoot a 59 in competition and the first LPGA player to cross the $2 million mark in single-season earnings. She set or tied a total of 30 LPGA records en route to regaining the Vare Trophy and winning her fourth Player of the Year and Money List titles in 2001. In a made-for-TV alternate shot competition between the two best male and female players in the world, Sörenstam and Tiger Woods beat Karrie Webb and David Duval.
At the end of that season Karrie Webb said she &quot;would eat her hat&quot; if Sörenstam repeated her eight wins in 2002. Sörenstam accomplished that feat, joining Mickey Wright as the only players to win 11 LPGA tournaments in one season, earning her fifth Player of the Year title and fifth Vare Trophy. She successfully defended the Kraft Nabisco Championship, her fourth major victory, and also won the ANZ Ladies Masters in Australia and Compaq Open in Sweden on the Ladies European Tour giving her 13 wins in 25 starts worldwide in 2002.

Sörenstam was invited to play in the PGA Tour&#x27;s Bank of America Colonial golf tournament in Fort Worth, Texas, in May 2003, making her the first woman to play in a PGA Tour event since Babe Zaharias, who qualified for the 1945 Los Angeles Open. Vijay Singh, fourth in the world rankings at the time, criticised her invitation, saying that she should have to qualify like the men and that he did not want to be beaten by a woman. Cheered through each hole, she shot five over par, tying for 96th out of the 111 who finished the first two rounds. After shooting 1-over-par 71 in the first round, finishing in 73rd and on pace to challenge for a weekend spot, Sörenstam said she was nervous all day but pleased by her performance. In the first round she led the field in driving accuracy, was in the top 20 in greens in regulation, and was 84th out of 111 in driving distance. Poor putting (last in the field, averaging over a two-putt) caused her to miss the cut.

Later in the 2003 season, she won the LPGA Championship and the Women&#x27;s British Open, becoming only the sixth player to complete the LPGA Career Grand Slam, winning, at least once in her career, each of the four tournaments recognized as major championships during the main part of her career. Five years earlier, in 1998, she finished second in the fifth major at the time, du Maurier Classic, which she won in 2001, the first year when it was not recognized as a major tournament anymore. She had won the Evian Masters twice, in 2000 and 2002, before it became recognized as the fifth major from 2013, which was after Sörenstam&#x27;s retirement in 2008.

She had five other victories worldwide in 2003, set or tied a total of 22 LPGA records and earned her sixth Player of the Year award. She competed against Fred Couples, Phil Mickelson and Mark O&#x27;Meara in the 2003 Skins Game, finishing second with five skins worth $225,000; Sörenstam holed a bunker shot on the ninth hole—the eighth eagle in Skins Game history. In September, she was part of the winning European Solheim Cup team in her native Sweden. She was awarded her second Jerringpriset award in Sweden plus the 2003 Golf Writers&#x27; Trophy by the Association of Golf Writers.

Sörenstam&#x27;s dominance continued in 2004 with her seventh LPGA Player of the Year award tying Kathy Whitworth for the most in LPGA history. She posted 16 top-10 finishes in 18 LPGA starts, including eight wins, had two additional international wins, became the first player to reach $15 million in LPGA career earnings and took her own LPGA single-season scoring average record to 68.69696, but played too few rounds to win the Vare Trophy. The Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation gave her the 2004 Sportswoman of the Year Award, and the Laureus World Sports Academy named her World Sportswoman of the Year. She also released a combination autobiography and golf instructional book, &quot;Golf Annika&#x27;s Way&quot;.

Sörenstam&#x27;s life both on and off the golf course changed in 2005. In February, she announced that she had filed for divorce from David Esch, her husband of eight years, and this was finalised in August but it did not adversely affect her golf. Her achievements included being the first player in LPGA history to win a major three consecutive years at the LPGA Championship and the first golfer in LPGA or PGA history to win the same event five consecutive years at the Mizuno Classic. 11 wins in 21 tournaments entered worldwide included victory in the Scandinavian TPC hosted by Annika where she presented &quot;herself&quot; the trophy, giving her an eighth Money List title, tying the LPGA record, an eighth Rolex Player of the Year (POY) award (a record) and a sixth Vare Trophy. She is the only LPGA player ever to win Money List, POY award and Vare trophy in the same year in five different years. Team competition saw her make her seventh consecutive Solheim Cup appearance, her 4 points making her total 21, the event&#x27;s all-time leading points earner, and the inaugural Lexus Cup was played with Sörenstam as the Captain of the victorious International Team.

These events resulted in her receiving numerous awards. The Golf Writers Association of America named Sörenstam Female Player of the Year for the eighth time (1995,1997, 2000–2005), Associated Press voted her Female Athlete of the Year for the third consecutive year and she became the first woman to win the Golf Writers&#x27; Trophy twice in the 55-year history of European golf&#x27;s most prestigious award. Having previously won six Best Female Golfer ESPY Awards (1996, 1998–99, 2002–04), Sörenstam also received the 2005 ESPY Award as Best Female Athlete

When the first-ever official Women&#x27;s World Golf Rankings were unveiled in February 2006, Sörenstam was confirmed as the number-one player in women&#x27;s golf, a position she relinquished to Lorena Ochoa on 22 April 2007. In partnership with Liselotte Neumann in team Sweden, she won the Women&#x27;s World Cup of Golf, opened her LPGA season with a defence of her title in the MasterCard Classic. She then went winless in eight starts, causing some to talk of a slump. Her winning drought ended at the U.S. Women&#x27;s Open, where she won an 18-hole playoff over Pat Hurst for her tenth major championship title, tying her for third on the list of players with most major championship titles. She totalled 3 wins on the LPGA and two on the Ladies European Tour, the inaugural Dubai Ladies Masters and the Swedish tournament she hosts, which she defended in her home town at the course where she learned to play. Her International team lost the second Lexus Cup competition to Team Asia.

Sörenstam started 2007 by losing a playoff while defending of her MasterCard Classic title. At the Kraft Nabisco Championship she shot her highest 72-hole score in a major in nine years, a result explained by her subsequent diagnosis with ruptured and bulging discs in her neck, the first major injury in Sörenstam&#x27;s 13-year LPGA career. After a two-month injury rehabilitation break, Sörenstam returned as the Ginn Tribute tournament hostess where she admitted to being at only 85% fitness and finished tied for 36th place. She was still not fully fit in her next two tournaments, the LPGA Championship where she finished tied for 15th place, and the 2007 U.S. Women&#x27;s Open, where, as defending champion, she finished tied for 32nd.

After an early round defeat at the World Matchplay Championship, Sörenstam finished sixth at the Evian Masters, 16th at the Women&#x27;s British Open and ninth in the Swedish tournament she hosts on the Ladies European Tour. On her return to the US, Sörenstam had three top ten finishes but missed the weekend at the season closing ADT Playoffs for the second year running. However, Sörenstam did win a worldwide title at the Dubai Ladies Masters on the Ladies European Tour in November 2007.

Declaring herself recovered from injury and ready to return to a complete season of competitive golf in 2008, Sörenstam opened the year at the SBS Open at Turtle Bay where she captured her 70th LPGA Tour victory and first since September 2006. She won next at the Stanford International Pro-Am in April then following a week off, won again at the Michelob ULTRA Open at Kingsmill in a tournament record score, giving her three wins and over $1 million in earnings by mid-May. It was her 72nd and final ever win on the LPGA Tour.

In 2008, Sörenstam was highly critical of other female golfers who tried to play in the PGA Tour – her comments to Michelle Wie for playing on the men&#x27;s tour: &quot;I really don&#x27;t know why Michelle continues to do this. We have a major this week and, if you can&#x27;t qualify for a major, I don&#x27;t see any reason why you should play with the men.&quot;

===Retirement===
On 13 May 2008, Sörenstam announced at a press conference at the Sybase Classic that she would &quot;step away&quot; from competitive golf at the conclusion of the 2008 season. That night, she threw out the first pitch of the Washington Nationals/New York Mets baseball game at Shea Stadium in New York and the following day read the Top Ten on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. Her last tournament victory came in a playoff at the Suzhou Taihu Ladies Open, an event co-sanctioned by the Ladies European Tour and the Ladies Asian Golf tour. Her last scheduled tournament on the LPGA Tour was the season-ending ADT Championship in November, where she failed to make the weekend play in the event&#x27;s unique playoff structure. Her final sanctioned LPGA appearance was as the winning captain of Team International at the 2008 Lexus Cup in Singapore. Her last professional tournament was the Dubai Ladies Masters on the Ladies European Tour in December 2008, where she finished tied for 7th.

===Solheim Cup captaincy===
At the 2013 Solheim Cup at the Colorado Golf Club in Parker, Colorado, United States, Sörenstam participated as a non-playing assistant captain, selected by European Team captain Liselotte Neumann. During the match, the Americans accused Sörenstam of telling a European caddie that European player Jodi Ewart Shadoff should concede a putt for par to Paula Creamer, so it could not show teammate Lexi Thompson the line for a coming putt. By the rules, only the captain was allowed to give advice to players during the competition. In the end, the 2013 match became an 18–10 triumph for the European team, winning on American soil for the first time and defending the cup for the first time.

For the 2015 Solheim Cup at Golf Club St. Leon-Rot, Germany, Sörenstam again was appointed an assistant captain by a Swedish European Team captain, this time Carin Koch. Two controversies with Sörenstam involved, given a lot of public attention, occurred during the match. The second day afternoon four-ball match between Suzann Pettersen and Charley Hull for Europe against Alison Lee and Brittany Lincicome, United States, was all square, when Lee missed a putt to win the 17th hole. Taking for granted that the next 18-inch putt was conceded, Lee picked up her ball. However, Pettersen pointed out that it was not conceded, and the Europeans won the hole. Koch and Sörenstam tried to convince Pettersen to change her mind and concede the putt, but as it was a fact that Lee had picked up her ball without the putt being given to her, it was not a possibility within the rules of golf, for the players to agree on the outcome of the hole and change the sequence of events afterwards. Pettersen/Hull eventually won the match.

Later during the 2015 Solheim Cup, after Koch and Sörenstam was seen in a discussion with U.S. captain Juli Inkster, Sörenstam explained that she was accused of giving advice, which she strongly denied. The 2015 match ended in a U.S. win 14–13, after a strong American come-back the last day, said to have been inspired by the incident with the not conceded putt.

Sörenstam was appointed captain of the 2017 European Solhem Cup team. The match, played at Des Moines Golf and Country Club, Iowa, United States, was won by the U.S. team 16–11.

===Comeback as a senior===
After turning 50 in October 2020, Sörenstam became eligible for the 2021 U.S. Senior Women&#x27;s Open. It was played at Brooklawn Country Club, Fairfield, Connecticut and Sörenstam won by 8 shots, ahead of fellow countrywoman Liselotte Neumann after leading the tournament wire to wire, with her husband Mike McGee as her caddie. Ahead of the Senior Open, she played her first LPGA Tour event since 2008, finishing 74th at the 2021 Gainbridge LPGA at Boca Rio.

Her win at the Senior Open qualified her to play in the 2022 U.S. Women&#x27;s Open, at which she missed the cut by shooting 13-over.

==Affiliations, honors==

In 1998, Sörenstam was awarded honorary member of the PGA of Sweden.

In four years, 2005-2008, Sörenstam was host for a Ladies European Tour tournament in Sweden, Scandinavian TPC hosted by Annika. She won the tournament twice herself during those years and another four times before that.

In 2012, Sörenstam founded the ANNIKA Invitational Europe, an annual amateur golf tournament in Sweden for European girls under 18. The tournament is a qualifying event for the European team in the Junior Solheim Cup since 2015 and has been rated up to level &quot;A&quot; in the World Amateur Golf Ranking.

In 2014, the LPGA established the yearly Rolex Annika Major Award, named after Sörenstam, to recognize the overall best performance in the LPGA majors. Points are award for top-10 finishes in each major. The major winner with the most points at the end of the season wins the award.

In February 2015, Sörenstam became one of seven women, invited as the first female honorary members of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. The other six women were HRH Princess Anne, Dame Laura Davies, Renee Powell, Belle Robertson, Lally Segard and Louise Suggs.

On 2 December 2020, Sörenstam was appointed president of the International Golf Federation from 1 January 2021.

In June 2021, Sörenstam hosted, together with fellow countryman Henrik Stenson, the Scandinavian Mixed hosted by Henrik and Annika, co-sanctioned by the European Tour and the Ladies European Tour, taking place in Sweden, for the first time bringing 78 men and 78 women together to compete in the same tournament for the same prize money, but playing from different tees. Sörenstam played in the first edition of the tournament at Vallda Golf &amp; Country Club as well as in the second edition in 2022 at Halmstad Golf Club and the third edition in 2023 at Ullna Golf &amp; Country Club.

In 2021, it was announced that Sörenstam will host an LPGA tournament in 2023; the ANNIKA Driven by Gainbridge at Pelican.

In 2022 Sörenstam accepted an invitation to become the first woman vice-president of the Association of Golf Writers, following in the footsteps of Sir Michael Bonallack, Tony Jacklin, Bernhard Langer, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player.

In October 2023, Sörenstam became, as the first LPGA player and one of few women, a member of Augusta National Golf Club.

==Business career==
Sörenstam began the transition from professional golfer to entrepreneur during the later years of her career, attempting to combine golf, fitness and charitable works into various businesses under the ANNIKA brand with the brand statement &quot;Share my Passion&quot;. They are all promoted by her website on which there is a blog to which she and her staff regularly contribute.

===Golf course design===
Since 2003, Sörenstam has also worked as a golf course architect, undertaken a number of course design projects. Her first, the Annika Course, was completed at Mission Hills Golf Club in Shenzhen, China, in 2003; the second was officially launched in January 2006 and opened in 2008 at Euphoria Golf Estate &amp; Hydro in South Africa. In 2008 she also announced a new project at Mines Golf City, near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Projects closer to home include a redesign of the Patriots Point Links Course near Charleston, South Carolina and a course at Red Mountain Resort, British Columbia.

She and Jack Nicklaus lost out on a bid to build the Olympic golf course in Rio to Gil Hanse and his consultant Amy Alcott. In 2010, a golf course she designed was opened in South Korea at Golden Bay Resort. This was the first project for her after-retirement golf course design.

In an interview with CNN in October 2017, Sörenstam spoke about the difficulties of being a woman in the golf course design industry, saying that a common stereotype is that courses she designs will be &quot;short and easy&quot;.

===The ANNIKA Academy===
The ANNIKA Academy at Ginn Reunion Resort in Reunion, Florida began construction in 2006 and opened in April 2007 with Sörenstam&#x27;s longtime coach Henri Reis serving as head instructor, her sister Charlotta an instructor and club fitter, her personal trainer Kai Fusser focusing on overall fitness training, and with Sörenstam available for coaching on certain golfing packages. The opening ceremony included a Make-A-Wish Foundation golf clinic conducted by Sörenstam who is a United States ambassador for the Make-A-Wish Foundation and it also hosted clinics for junior golfers during The Annika Invitational, an American Junior Golf Association invitation-only event featuring the top 60 girls from around the world hosted by The ANNIKA Foundation.

The Annika Academy closed in May 2016.

===Other business ventures===
Other branches of the ANNIKA business include a clothing line with Cutter &amp; Buck, a limited label wine produced in partnership with Wente Vineyards, and a signature fragrance developed by SA Fragrances. Sörenstam also hosted the Ginn Tribute Hosted by Annika, an event on the LPGA Tour in 2007 and 2008, and the Scandinavian TPC hosted by Annika on the Ladies European Tour during its last four years from 2005 through 2008. She won the latter tournament in 2005 and 2006.

One of Sörenstam&#x27;s hobbies is cooking. She has participated in cooking demonstrations during LPGA tournaments and has talked about enrolling in cooking school. Before the 2003 season Sörenstam took the opportunity to improve her culinary skills by working eight-hour shifts in the kitchens of the Lake Nona Country Club. Sörenstam has had a serious interest in investments, real estate and the stock market since she earned her first LPGA check and in August 2006 was invited to ring the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange.

<text>Paulus Potter (; 20 November 1625 (baptised) – 17 January 1654 (buried)) was a Dutch painter who specialized in animals within landscapes, usually with a low vantage point.

Before Potter died of tuberculosis at the age of 28 he succeeded in producing about 100 paintings, working continuously.

==Life==
Paulus Potter was born in Enkhuizen. He was baptized on 20 November 1625. In 1628 his family moved to Leiden, and in 1631 to Amsterdam, where young Paulus studied painting with his father, Pieter Symonsz Potter. After his mother died, his father started an affair with the wife of Pieter Codde, also living in the fancy Sint Antoniesbreestraat. For some time his father was a manufacturer of gilded leather hangings outside the city walls.

Potter became a member of the Guild of Saint Luke in Delft, but by 1649, he moved to The Hague, next to Jan van Goyen. In July 1650, Potter married Adriana van Balckeneynde (1627-1690). His father-in-law was a leading building contractor in the Hague and introduced him to the Dutch elite. Amalia of Solms-Braunfels, a member of the stadholder&#x27;s family and an art-lover, bought one of Potter&#x27;s paintings, &quot;The Farmyard&quot;, but some court ladies seemed to have advised against it. In May 1652, he returned to Amsterdam on invitation of Nicolaes Tulp, who owned a number of his paintings. Tulp was impressed by his civilized behavior and politeness and had Potter paint his son, Dirck Tulp, as a noble equestrian. Potter composed a will in January of 1653 and died a year later of tuberculosis, two months after his 28th birthday.

Paulus painted a self-portrait which was at Hackwood Park, Hampshire until 1998.

==Paintings==
Potter&#x27;s most famous painting is &quot;The Young Bull&quot; (circa 1647), and is not to be confused with his work &quot;The Bull&quot;. &quot;The Young Bull&quot; was composed after drawings Potter made in nature, and is now located in Mauritshuis in The Hague. Though this painting was criticized, it was greatly admired during the 19th century as an early example of Romanticism. &quot;The Young Bull&quot; features as the canvas being studied in Mark Tansey&#x27;s 1981 monochromatic oil on canvas &quot;The Innocent Eye Test&quot;.

==Memorials==

A statue of Potter (sketching a distant statue of a goat) was erected at the Drommedaris in Enkhuizen in 1991.

<doc id="102103" wikidata="Q1547646" url="?curid=102103" title="Alexander Morrison National Park">
<text>Alexander Morrison National Park is a national park in Western Australia, located north of Perth in the Shire of Coorow along the Green Head-Coorow Road. It was named for Alexander Morrison, the first Government Botanist of Western Australia.

==Description==
The park contains sandplains and low lateritic breakaways over sandstones and shales of the Lower Jurassic Cockleshell Gully Formation. Sand heaths are the dominant vegetation, but the park also contains extensive stands of low woodland and mallee typical of the area, especially in the western parts of the park. Prominent eucalypt species in the area are Powder-barked Wandoo (&quot;Eucalyptus accedens&quot;) and Mallalie (&quot;E. eudesmoides&quot;), while the heaths are rich in species typical of the region and include rare species such as spiral bush (&quot;Spirogardnera rubescens&quot;). The northern variant of &quot;Banksia vestita&quot; is also common.

==History==
Land for the national park was set aside by the Department of Lands and Surveys under Reserves ↑26800, ↑26803 and ↑26804 on 23 May 1969, and over 1970 and 1971, the land was classified as an &quot;A&quot; Class reserve, meaning its purpose could not be changed except by an Act of Parliament, and vested in the National Parks Authority of Western Australia. The park was officially named on 8 October 1971.

The Environmental Protection Authority recommended in 1974 that a one-kilometre-wide strip of vacant Crown land on the south side of Green Head-Coorow Road be added to the reserve – however, this was not actioned.

<text>Avon Valley is a national park in Western Australia, 47 kilometres northeast of Perth. It was named after the Avon River, which flows through it. The area is an undulating plateau with the sides of the valley steeply sloping back to the river approximately below. The area contains granite outcrops and a mix of soil types including loams, gravels and lateritic sands.

There is also an eponymous locality of the City of Swan, but the boundaries of the national park and the locality are not identical.

==Description==
It was officially named on 15 October 1971.

Jarrah, marri and wandoo trees are found in the park along with 90 different species of birds, making it an ideal place for bird watching. Christmas trees and grasstrees are interspersed through the woodlands.

In the springtime the park is visited by wildflower enthusiasts to view the diverse range of flowers, including dryandras, donkey orchids and lechenaultias. Other plants found in the area are Conostylis, and the rare fringed lily is also found within the park.

The bushranger Moondyne Joe used the area as a hide-out with his cave and corral situated within the park boundaries. Both have since been damaged by a series of bushfires within the park. The area was subsequently designated as a reserve within the National Park in the Moondyne Nature Reserve in 1981.

The third route of the Eastern Railway is in parts the southern border of the park, on the southern side of the Avon River, and provides - at times of bushfires and other emergencies - a track and point of access.

== Facilities ==
Entry and camping fees apply for visitors to the park. Toilets, water, shaded areas and wood barbecues are available for use. Trail signage and an information shelter are located within the park and a dedicated ranger is on site ( No longer on site).

<doc id="102107" wikidata="Q814030" url="?curid=102107" title="Greater Beedelup National Park">
<text>Greater Beedelup National Park is a national park in Western Australia, 277 km south of Perth. It is situated on the Vasse Highway 10 km west of Pemberton. The park is especially lush and damp due to an abundance of water.

Gazetted in 1910, the park was declared an A Class Reserve in 1915. The Pemberton National Parks Board has been responsible for management of the park since 1957. Controlled burns occur within the park and some clear felling operations have been conducted in selected areas that used to be State Forests but have also been regenerated since.

The park is mostly karri forest, with mixed areas of jarrah and marri. The loamy soil supports large colonies of moss and plants such as the swamp peppermint, hibbertia, karri hazel, waterbush, myrtle wattle and lemon-scented darwinia, all of which thrive in the damp conditions. Some of the forest is an excellent example of uncut old-growth forest. Some of the upland areas are sandy and support communities of heath vegetation. Other plants of interest in the area include &quot;Crowea dentata&quot;, &quot;Crowea augustifolia&quot; and &quot;Choretrum lateriflorum&quot;.

Some rare fauna are thought to inhabit the area, including the woylie, numbat and the tammar.

Its major attraction is the Beedelup Falls, which are in full flow during winter and spring. A suspension bridge, built in 1995, offers passage across Beedelup Brook and good views of the falls.

Another feature of the park is the &quot;walk through karri tree&quot;, a 400-year-old tree with a large man-made hole cut through at the base large enough for a person to stand in.

The park is named after Beedelup Brook, named in 1875. It is thought the name Beedelup is derived from the Noongar word &quot;Beejalup&quot; meaning &quot;place of rest&quot; or &quot;place of sleep&quot;.

== Facilities ==

An admission fee applies for this park, and camping is not permitted.
A signed walking trail around Beedelup Falls, a rest area, picnic area and toilets are available for use by visitors.

<doc id="102108" wikidata="Q893086" url="?curid=102108" title="Boorabbin National Park">
<text>Boorabbin National Park is a national park in Western Australia, between Coolgardie and Southern Cross. It is located along the Great Eastern Highway for a distance of approximately 25 km with a width of 5 km on each side in Western Australia&#x27;s eastern goldfields. The park gets its name from the Aboriginal named rock on the edge of the park and also the Boorabbin settlement, established in 1898.

The Boorabbin National Park is situated on top of a plateau. The landscape is primarily sand and the vegetation there is quite distinctive growing in deep sands deposited over 50 million years ago. Today the erosion of this significant landscape is lessening, but as a result of past degradation, the sands are left very weathered, leached and lacking in nutrients.

Despite this, the vegetation is diverse with countless species thriving in this environment. Vegetation ranges from the rich kwongan heaths, woodlands and mallee shrublands. The area is recognised for its unique variety of vegetation, with its own designated plateau vegetation system. Other attributes that the park is known for are the wildflowers, samphire and salt lakes.

Other vegetation that can be found include species of banksia, acacia, hakea, sandalwood, melaleuca and grasstree. Two restricted species found in the heathland are &quot;Philotheca pachyphylla&quot; and &quot;Philotheca coccinea&quot;.

Fauna surveys in the park indicate that 17 native mammal species, including the wongai ningaui, dunnarts and bush rats, are found within the park boundaries. Other animals including 4 frog species, 52 species of reptile and 51 bird species are also resident in the park. The park is also home to a rich array of dragon lizards.

A bushfire in the park killed three men after a roadblock was lifted on Great Eastern Highway in Coolgardie in December 2007 after a long queue of vehicles were waiting for the highway to open after being closed for most of the day. The three truck drivers tried to turn around and flee the fire but could not escape and died from smoke burns. The bushfire continued to burn for two weeks before being extinguished by fire fighters, and authorities then had the highway reopened. An inquiry into the fire was commenced in 2008; the coroner found that extreme incompetence by the Department of Environment and Conservation had contributed toward the deaths.
The fire burnt out an area of more than of the National Park and unallocated crown land. The fire jumped containment lines onto the southern side of Great Eastern Highway.

A memorial garden and shelter was opened near the old town site in 2010 for those who died in the 2007 bushfire.

<text>Brockman National Park is a national park in the South West region of Western Australia, south of Perth and south of Pemberton.

The park, situated on both sides of the Pemberton-Northcliffe road, is a eucalypt forest composed of karri &quot;Eucalyptus diversicolor&quot; interspersed with marri &quot;Corymbia calophylla&quot;. The forest understorey is made up of a mix of plants including the swamp peppermint &quot;Taxandria linearifolia&quot;, karri hazel, karri wattle (&quot;Acacia pentadenia&quot;) and the karri sheoak &quot;Allocasuarina decussata &quot;, all of which thrive in the damp conditions.

The northern border of the park is the Warren River and the Warren National Park borders it to the west.

No entry fee applies for the park and no facilities are available to visitors.

The name is taken from the nearby Yeagarup Homestead that used to be known as Brockman Station.

<doc id="102110" wikidata="Q442279" url="?curid=102110" title="Cape Arid National Park">
<text>Cape Arid National Park is a national park located in Western Australia, southeast of Perth. The park is situated east of Esperance and lies on the shore of the south coast from the eastern end of the Recherche Archipelago.

The bay at its eastern side is Israelite Bay, a locality often mentioned in Bureau of Meteorology weather reports as a geographical marker. The western end is known as Duke of Orleans Bay.
Its coastline is defined by Cape Arid, a bay called Sandy Bight and, further east, Cape Pasley.

The locality of Cape Arid of the Shire of Esperance shares almost identical boundaries with the national park, the exception being a number of roads passing through the park and locality which are part of the later but not the former.

==History==
The first European to discover the area was the French Admiral Bruni D&#x27;Entrecasteaux in 1792 and he named it &quot;Cap Aride&quot;; Matthew Flinders anglicized the name in 1802 and the park took its name from this feature.

Pioneer graziers arrived in the area in the 1870s and the ruins of homesteads, dams and buildings as well as gravesites can be found near Pine Hill and Thomas Fishery.

Bay whaling was conducted by Thomas Sherratt at Barrier Anchorage in the 1870s. John Thomas also seems to have had a bay whaling operation in the 1860s at Thomas&#x27;s Fishery.

As a result of the 2015 Esperance bushfires up to 90% of the remaining Western Ground Parrot habitat within the park was burned. Much of the habitat had already been burned by a bushfire in Cape Arid National Park during October of the same year. Prior to the fires, there were believed to be only 140 individual parrots living in the wild, and the number was estimated to have been reduced to only 30–40 as a result of the damage caused by the fires. The widespread destruction of dense vegetation the ground-dwelling birds rely on for nesting prompted discussion that the critically endangered parrot could &quot;... become the first bird in at least 200 years to become extinct in Western Australia&quot;. Two parrots—a male and a female—were rescued from the Cape Arid fire ground and taken to Perth Zoo for inclusion in a captive breeding program, however both birds died in captivity.

==Environment==

===Geography===
The area is composed of sandy beaches and rocky headlands to the south with low granite hills extending to the north to join the jagged Russell Range that is primarily composed of pre-cambrian quartzite. The highest point of the park is Tower Peak, located within the Range, which reaches a height of . Sand-plains that are rich in flora surround the hill areas.

The eastern boundary of the park joins the western side of Nuytsland Nature Reserve. Ngadju Indigenous Protected Area adjoins the park on the north.

===Fauna===
A wide variety of habitat exists within the park which supports a wide variety of flora and fauna. The park is an important site for the bird life in Western Australia. It is home to over 160 species of birds including some that are endangered and restricted. Some of the birds found in the park include: the western ground parrot, the Australasian bittern, Carnaby&#x27;s cockatoo and Cape Barren geese.

Fauna that can be found include the western brush wallaby, quenda, the southern bush rat, many small marsupial predators and a variety of reptiles and amphibians.

A rare and primitive species of ant of the genus &quot;Nothomyrmecia&quot; is thought to inhabit the area.

===Flora===
Vegetation found within the park is mostly on young dune systems that have large communities of coastal heath with smaller systems of yate, banksia, paperbark and mallee.
Species of orchid and ferns exist near Mount Ragged including a small population of the sticky-tail flower (&quot;Anthocersis viscosa&quot;).

===Trails===
Many walk trails can be found in the park, including the Len Otte Nature Trail, Tagon Coastal Trail, Boolenup Walk Trail and walks up both Mount Ragged and Mount Arid. The most accessible campsite is at Thomas River with conventional drive access, barbecues, toilets and water tanks. Other campsites at Mount Ragged, Poison Creek and Deal Creek are only accessible by four-wheel drive vehicles.

<text>Cape Le Grand National Park is a national park in Western Australia, south-east of Perth and east of Esperance. The park covers an area of 
The area is an ancient landscape which has been above sea level for well over 200 million years and remained unglaciated. As a result, the area is home to many primitive relict species.
Established in 1966, the park is managed by the Department of Parks and Wildlife.
The name Le Grand is from one of the officers on &quot;L&#x27;Espérance&quot;, one of the ships in the 1792 expedition of Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux.

The locality of Cape Le Grand of the Shire of Esperance shares almost identical boundaries with the national park, the exception being a number of roads in the west of the park and locality, which are part of the later but not the former.

== Geography ==
The largely granite shoreline and white sand beaches are picturesque features of the area. The park is a used for fishing, off-roading, tourism, and hiking.
Beaches within the Park include those at Lucky Bay, Rossiter Bay, Hellfire Bay, Le Grand Beach, and Thistle Cove.
The islands and waters to the south of the park are known as the &quot;Recherche Archipelago Nature Reserve&quot;, another protected area of the Recherche Archipelago and nearby coastal regions. The Cape Arid National Park is located to the east.
The southwest section of the park is dominated by rock outcrops of gneiss and granite. These form a distinctive chain of peaks including Mount Le Grand (345 m), Frenchman Peak (262 m), and Mississippi Hill (180 m, named after the &quot;Mississippi&quot;, a French whaler).
Further inland, the park comprises mostly heath-covered sandplain, interspersed with swamps and pools of fresh water.

== Wildlife ==
The sandplains support dense stands of banksias (&quot;Banksia speciosa&quot; and &quot;Banksia pulchella&quot;).

Other flora that can be found around the park include species of &quot;Melaleuca&quot;, &quot;Grevillea&quot;, sheoak, Christmas tree and grass trees.
Wildflower blooms peak in the austral spring, lasting until October and species such as blue china orchid &quot;Cyanicula gemmata&quot;, &quot;Diuris corymbosa&quot;, &quot;Hakea laurina&quot;, &quot;Thysanotus sparteus&quot; and &quot;Thelymitra macrophylla&quot; are represented within the park.

Fauna that are commonly found within the park include bandicoots, pygmy honey possums, ring tailed possums, quenda and western grey kangaroos.
Some of the relict species with gondwanan links that are found within the park include species of legless lizard, like the common scaly-foot &quot;Pygopus lepidopodus&quot;, and &quot;Delma fraseri&quot;, &quot;Delma australis&quot; and &quot;Aprasia striolata&quot;. The ancient, although non-gondwanan, blind snake &quot;Ramphotyphlops australis&quot; is also found within the park.
Endemic frogs found within the area include the quacking frog &quot;Crinia georgiana&quot;, the banjo frog &quot;Limnodynastes dorsalis&quot; and the humming frog &quot;Neobatrachus pelobatoides&quot;.

== Facilities ==
Facilities include toilets, barbecues, campsites, tables, sheltered areas, walk trails, information bays, and water tanks. Two full-time rangers are residents of the park. Check the Cape LeGrand Campground website for booking details. During busy holiday periods, there is a &#x27;camp host&#x27; couple who helps manage the site.

<text>Cape Range National Park is a national park in the Gascoyne region of Western Australia, north of Perth. The park occupies the western side of the North West Cape peninsula over an area of . The nearest town is Exmouth, and directly off the coast is the Ningaloo Reef. The area resulted from a gradual uplifting from the sea floor followed by fluctuating sea levels, wind and water erosion that have slowly eroded the range and plain leaving behind a range of rugged limestone, deep canyons, and pristine beaches.

There is also an eponymous locality of the Shire of Exmouth, but the boundaries of the national park and the locality are not identical.

==Overview==
The Cape is the only elevated plateau composed of limestone on the North West Coast. The range has plateaus to an elevation of and forms the backbone of the peninsula which extends as far as North West Cape.

Yardie Creek, a spectacular gorge where the water is trapped by a sandbar, is located within the park.

Over 700 caves are located within the park and it is probable that many others remain undiscovered.
Over 630 species of wildflower are found within the park, that generally bloom toward the end of winter, including the bird flower and the desert sturt pea.

The area was under pastoral lease beginning in 1876 when J Brockman acquired leases in the area covering North West Cape to run cattle. Brockman sold parts of the lease in 1888 to ornithologist Thomas Carter including Yardie Creek and Ningaloo Station. Carter was the first settler in the area and established a pastoral station in 1889. The area was declared a national park in 1964, the off-shore area, Ningaloo Marine Park, was declared in 1987.

An abundance of flora and fauna are found within the park. Flora species include mangroves, acacia, spinifex, grevillea, verticordia, eucalyptus and minilya lily. Fauna found within the park include rock wallabies, red kangaroos, emus, euros, 100 different species of bird and 80 species of reptile.

<text>Collier Range National Park is a national park in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, northeast of Perth.

The nearest major town to the park is Newman located about north near Kumarina. The park is one of many in the Pilbara and was established in 1978.

The ranges vary from low hills to high ridges with many cliffs. The vegetation found in the area is mostly spinifex and mulga with creeklines being surrounded by eucalypts. Mulga scrub and mulla mulla are found in dense scrubland in the northeastern plains with spinifex and sand dunes being found in the western end.

The park is the home of the threatened Pilbara Pebble-Mound Mouse &quot;Pseudomys chapmani&quot; which is also found in the Millstream-Chichester National Park and the Karlamilyi National Park.

The mulga habitat is a refuge for the critical weight range mammals such as &quot;Macrotis lagotis&quot; (greater bilby), &quot;Dasycercus cristicauda&quot; (mulgara) and &quot;dasyurids&quot;.

The standard of management in the park is poor and is only visited occasionally by Department of Parks and Wildlife staff from Karratha. The park is baited for wild dogs but suffers damage from feral donkeys and wandering cattle. No fire management is in practice and weed problems are unknown.

<text>D&#x27;Entrecasteaux National Park is a national park in Western Australia, south of Perth. The park is named after the French Admiral Bruni D&#x27;Entrecasteaux who was the first European to sight the area and name Point D&#x27;Entrecasteaux in 1792.
The park received 168,497 visitors through 2008–2009.

==Description==
The park stretches from Black Point in the west to Long Point in the east and extends inland as far as . Black Point is made of basalt columns from a lava flow that occurred 135 million years ago. An interesting feature in the park is Yeagarup dune, a mobile long sand dune found to the west of Lake Jasper.

The park contains a great variety of scenery, including beaches, sand-dunes, coastal cliffs, coastal heath and pockets of karri forest. Rivers such as the Warren, the Donnelly and the Shannon flow through the park and discharge into the waters off-shore.

Important large scale wetlands, known as the Blackwater, and lakes such as Lake Jasper and Lake Yeagarup are found within the park boundaries.

Broke Inlet is contained within the park boundaries at the eastern end; it is the only inlet in the South West that has not been significantly altered within the catchment area. The gneiss basement rocks project through the shallow waters to form small islands in the Inlet.

Sandy Island in Windy Harbour is part of the park; it is an important nesting site for seabirds, with up to 300,000 breeding pairs of flesh-footed shearwaters, a high proportion of the global population.

==Facilities==
The park has an entry fee that applies to all visitors.
Facilities available to visitors include barbecues, toilets, 4WD tracks, camp sites, disabled access and picnic areas. Canoeing facilities also exist within the park on the Deep River. Rangers regularly patrol the area.

The Bibbulmun Track passes through the park area.

The outdoor education organisation, Outward Bound, operate within the park taking school groups on hiking expeditions.

<text>Drovers Cave National Park is a national park in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, northwest of Perth. The nearest town is Jurien Bay to the west.

The area is composed of limestone and numerous caves are known to exist within the park boundaries. Many of the caves are locked with screens to keep visitors out in the interest of public safety and to prevent vandalism.

Some of the other caves found within the park include Hastings, Moora, Old River and Mystery Caves. Hastings cave is known to contain fossils.

Drovers Cave was well known to early explorers and stockmen; the location of the site near to the Canning Stock Route meant it was often visited by drovers, hence the name. The first known visit to the cave was a drover who signed the cave wall in 1886. Many more visits occurred between 1930 and 1940. The cave was surveyed in 1973 and gazetted as part of the National Park the same year.

Native flora within the park includes shrub banksia, one-sided bottlebrush and parrot bush. Fauna includes emus, honey possums, western pygmy possums, short-beaked echidnas, western grey kangaroos, Australian bustards and many reptiles.

<text>Drysdale River National Park is a national park in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, northeast of Perth.

The park lies about south of Kalumburu and west of Wyndham.

The park is the largest and least accessible in the Kimberley, with no public road leading to it and no airstrip within its boundaries. Access to the park is gained via the track from Carson River Station from the Kalumburu Road. Permission must be obtained from the Kalumburu Aboriginal Corporation prior to entering the park. There are no visitor facilities or marked walk trails in the park. Rangers do not patrol the park and no food, fuel or mechanical services exist within the park or at Carson River Station.

The park is a good example of untouched Kimberley, wilderness featuring open woodland, gorges, cliffs, and the pools, waterfalls and creeks of the Drysdale River. The park is home to two large waterfalls, Morgan Falls and Solea Falls, with numerous smaller falls along the course of the river.

The area provides habitat for many rare plants and animals. Almost 600 species of plants are known to exist within the park. About 30 of these plants are aquatic and swamp varieties that inhabit the permanent pools found along the Drysdale and Carson Rivers. About 25 species of fern also inhabit the area, two of which are not found elsewhere. Species such as fan palms, kalumbaru gums and paperbarks are also found along the watercourses.

A variety of fauna also exist within the park, including over 100 species of birds, sugar gliders, bats, wallabies, and salt water crocodiles.

The traditional owners of the area that the river flows through are the Ngarinjin, Miwa and Wilawila peoples.

The first European to visit the area was a surveyor with a squatting company, CA Burrowes, who did so in 1886. Both Brockman and Crossland visited the area in separate expeditions in 1901. The first vehicular track was constructed through the region during an expedition and survey in 1954; it ran from Gibb River Station to Kalumburu. The park was gazetted in September 1974, using the boundaries recommended by the Australian Academy of Science committee on National Parks in 1955.

<text>Eucla National Park is a national park in Western Australia, east of Perth.

The southern edge of the park borders a section of the Great Australian Bight. Other notable features of the park include Wilson Bluff and Delisser sandhills.

The area is composed of mallee scrub and heath vegetation, typical of the southern coast. Wildflowers such as Cockie&#x27;s Tongue (&quot;Templetonia retusa&quot;), with its distinctive red, pink or yellow flowers are common throughout the park. A rare plant species of senecio that is native to the limestone cliff area is known to exist in the park.

Access to the area is via the Eyre Highway found on the northern border of the park. No facilities are available for visitors in the park and no sealed roads exist within the park, only 4WD tracks.

No camping is permitted within the park; the nearest camping facilities are at Eucla and Border Village.

Historical ruins such as the Eucla Telegraph station and the original Eucla township can be found at the western end of the park. Both are partially buried by encroaching sand dunes.

<text>Fitzgerald River National Park is a national park in the Shires of Ravensthorpe and the Shire of Jerramungup in Western Australia, southeast of Perth. The park is recognised on Australia&#x27;s National Heritage List for its outstanding diversity of native plant species, including many plants which are unique to the local area. Although the park only occupies 0.2 percent of Western Australia&#x27;s land surface, it is home to over 20% of the state&#x27;s native plant species.

There is also an eponymous locality, stretching across the shires of Jerramungup and Ravensthorpe, but the boundaries of the national park and the locality are not identical.

==Description==
The park includes the Barren Mountains (East, Middle, and West Mount Barren), the Eyre Range and the Fitzgerald River as well as incorporating the Fitzgerald Biosphere. There are 62 plant species which are unique to the park and a further 48 are rarely found elsewhere.

Recording almost 40,000 visitors in 2008, the park received $20 million in funding from the federal government&#x27;s economic stimulus plan with the state government contributing an additional $20 million. The investment is to be used to redevelop and seal of roads within the park, construct a walking trail from Bremer Bay to Hopetoun, and upgrade existing recreational facilities.

Point Ann is one of the two places (the other is Head of the Bight) along Australia&#x27;s coast where southern right whales come to calve during their winter migration.
Within the National Park is the Quaalup Homestead Wilderness Retreat (now run as a hotel) that was built in 1858 by the Wellstead Family. In 1890, the Hassell family took over the pastoral lease and the homestead.
The park can be accessed from the western side via Bremer Bay, or from the eastern side via Hopetoun. The central area of the park is only accessible with a four-wheel-drive vehicle or on foot.
Many of the peaks in the park are off limits to climbers to prevent the spread of dieback or root rot from &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot;.

The northwest precinct of the park is referred to as &quot;Twertup&quot;, a name applied to several plants and features of the landscape. The Twertup Field Studies Centre, so named, previously occupied a former residence known as Twertup Cottage until the spongolite construction was destroyed by fire. Twertup is given in formal names associated with the area, for the watercourse Twertup Creek, a road, and several plant taxa, the Twertup mallee &quot;Eucalyptus arborella&quot;, Twertup feather-flower &quot;Verticordia crebra&quot;, and &quot;Leucopogon&quot; sp. Twertup for an unknown species described by K.R. Newbey that was found in the area. The nineteenth century author Ethel Hassell, who lived nearby at Jerramungup station, gives a chapter with this title. A warning that the young woman should avoid staying in the area, while heeded, was mysterious about the actual threat. This was later explained by Hassel&#x27;s Nyungar friend, Gimbuck, who now advised her to sleep with two fires and away from water because of the reputation of groups of &#x27;wild dogs&#x27; (dingos) in the area; this practical concern was accompanied by the ancestral story of their abundance.

In February 2023, a Coulson Aviation Boeing 737-300 crashed while fighting fires in the national park; both pilots survived the crash.

==Flora and fauna==
The park forms the basis of the internationally recognised Biosphere Reserve recognised by the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Program. The latest floral inventory lists 1693 taxa of plants with 250 of these being rare and 62 being known to be found only within the confines of the park. Some species of interest include the royal hakea, qualup bell, scarlet banksia, showy banksia, bell-fruit mallee, pea flowers, feather flowers, many species of eucalypts and bottlebrushes (&quot;Callistemon&quot; and &quot;Beaufortia&quot;).

Three populations of the crowned mallee all exist within the park and have a total number of 140 trees.
An endangered species, &quot;Boronia clavata&quot;, has five populations totalling only 100 individuals all of which are located in the area. Another two endangered species, the barrens wedding bush and the fan-leaf grevillea, are also found within the park although in the case of the barrens wedding bush, not exclusively.

The park is also home to 22 species of mammal, 200 bird species, 41 species of reptile and 12 species of frog. It is recognised as an Important Bird Area; some of the rarer species are the western bristlebird, western ground parrot and the western whipbird. The endangered malleefowl is also known to inhabit the park with seven known and recorded sightings having been made in 1998.
Some of the mammals found are the very rare dibbler and the heath rat, both of which were thought to be extinct at one time or another. The tammar wallaby and woylie, both of which are threatened species, are known to inhabit the mallee and heath areas of the park. Other species such as the quenda, chuditch and the red-tailed phascogale also inhabit the area.

Migratory birds find refuge in the wetland and coastal regions and species that temporarily inhabit the area include the white-bellied sea eagle, Pacific swift, and the Caspian tern.

<text>Francois Peron National Park is a national park on the Peron Peninsula in Western Australia, north of Perth, and located within the boundary of the Shark Bay World Heritage area. The nearest towns to the park are Denham, which is found on the southern edge of the park and Carnarvon which is found about to the north.
There is also an eponymous locality of the Shire of Shark Bay, but the boundaries of the national park and the locality are not identical.

==Names and earlier uses==
Aboriginal Australians are the initial inhabitants of the area and have been living in it for over 26,000 years. The local peoples, who speak the Malgana language, call the area .

It is named after the French naturalist and explorer François Péron who was the zoologist aboard Nicolas Baudin&#x27;s 1801 and 1803 scientific expeditions to Western Australia, and is situated within the bounds of the earlier pastoral lease of the Peron Station.

Locations from the French exploration era include:
* Guichenault (east coast of the Peron Peninsula)
* Cape Lesueur (west coast of the Peron Peninsula)
* Lake Montbazin

A pearling camp was established on the peninsula at Herald Bight in the 1880s and the remains of shells can still be found along the beach.

Used as a sheep station from the early 1900s onwards the station was sold to the state government in 1990.

It was gazetted on 8 January 1993 as a National Parkthrough the purchase of Peron Station (Pastoral Lease 3114/761) in 1990.

==Location==
It is adjacent to and surrounded by the Shark Bay Marine Park to the west, north and east, and by the Denham to Monkey Mia road to the south.

==Facilities==
Picnic, boat launching and camping areas along the west coast of the Peninsula include:
* Big Lagoon
* Cape Lesueur
* Cattle Well
* South Gregories
* Gregories
* Bottle Bay

<text>Danggu (Geikie) Gorge National Park is a national park in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, (great-circle distance) northeast of Perth and approximately east of Broome by road.

 it is closed owing to damage caused by flooding of the Fitzroy River in 2023.

==Dan͟ggu Geikie Gorge==

Dan͟ggu Geikie Gorge (), formerly Geikie Gorge, is a feature of the Napier Range located within the National Park, from Fitzroy Crossing. It is believed to be one of the best-known and most easily accessed gorges in the region.

Along with Tunnel Creek and Windjana Gorge, Geikie Gorge is part of an ancient barrier reef that developed during the Devonian Period. The walls of the gorge are high. The gorge was created by the flowing waters of the Fitzroy River, which still flows through the region. Freshwater crocodiles, Leichhardt&#x27;s sawfish and coach-whip stingrays inhabit the river. The level of the river in the wet season can rise by up to , and the flood level can be clearly seen on the walls where the abrasive action of the floodwaters on the limestone has scoured the surface white.

==Geology==
The limestone was originally a reef formed not by corals but by algae and lime-secreting organisms that are now extinct. The reef was formed in the Devonian period when the receding waters allowed the organisms to build a reef up to thick. The remains of the reef now stand as the limestone range that wind across the countryside up to above the plains. Fossils from the Devonian can be found within the limestone strata.

==History==
The gorge was originally named in honour of Sir Archibald Geikie, the Director General of Geological Survey for Great Britain and Ireland when it was named in 1883. Known by local Bunuba people as Darngku or as it is more usually spelt, Danggu, the gorge was later (sometime before June 2019) renamed Dan͟ggu Geikie Gorge. &quot;Danggu&quot; means &quot;the area where the water is very deep under the cave&quot; in the Bunuba language.

In 2023, many of the park&#x27;s facilities were damaged by heavy flooding when the Fitzroy River rose , and the river itself was changed permanently in some places. The park had to be closed, and a recovery plan has been undertaken, with hopes to reopen the park sometime in 2024.

==Park access and facilities==
Danggu Geikie Gorge National Park is part of the Balili (Devonian Reef) Conservation Park.

It lies around (great-circle distance) northeast of Perth and approximately east of Broome by road.

The park is one of the most accessible in the Kimberley as it is only from Fitzroy Crossing and is serviced by a sealed road. No camping is allowed in the park and visitors can only enter during the day. The park has picnic shelters, barbecue areas, toilets and water available.

A walk trail exists along the western base of the gorge walls; although the terrain is rough and uneven it does offer an excellent view. The eastern side of the gorge is closed to visitors as it is a nature preserve. Tour boats also operate in the gorge and a boat ramp is available for the public to use. Hours of use of the boat ramp are restricted to outside of boat tour times.

However, , the park is closed owing to flood damage sustained in 2023.

==Flora and fauna==
The river water sustains an abundance of life, including barramundi, sawfish and freshwater crocodiles, all of which can be found in the gorge.

The vegetation that fringes the river bank includes river gums, freshwater mangroves, pandanus, cadjeput and native figs. Dense banks of reeds are also found along the banks. The flora provides a suitable habitat for a range of fauna, including fruit bats, lilac-crowned wren, reed warbler and the great bowerbird.

<doc id="102123" wikidata="Q8028571" url="?curid=102123" title="Wittenberg University">
<text>Wittenberg University is a private liberal arts college in Springfield, Ohio. It has 1,326 full-time students drawn from 33 states and 9 foreign countries. Wittenberg University is associated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

==History==

Wittenberg College was founded in 1845 by a group of ministers in the English Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Ohio, which had previously separated from the recently established German-speaking Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Ohio and Other States. The college was named for the historic University of Wittenberg in Wittenberg, Germany, the town in which Martin Luther famously posted his &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot; on the church door on October 31, 1517.

A German American pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, the Rev. Ezra Keller was the principal founder and first president of the college. Its initial focus was to train clergy with the Hamma School of Divinity as its theological department. One of its main missions was to &quot;Americanize&quot; Lutherans by teaching courses in the English language instead of German, unlike the nearby Capital University in Columbus, Ohio.

The first class originally consisted of eight students at the beginning of the academic year, but grew to seventy-one by the end. With a faculty of one professor and two tutors, classes were held in Springfield, Ohio, in a church on land that was donated. That city was selected for its location on the National Road, running from the eastern cities of Baltimore and Cumberland, Maryland, to the west in the Illinois Country, eventually to the territorial capital of Vandalia, near the Mississippi River.

In 1874, women were admitted to the college, and, the following year, black people were admitted. The college attained university status in 1957 and was renamed accordingly. In 1993, the university and its namesake city Wittenberg entered into an official partnership. 

In 1995, the American Philosophical Association censured Wittenberg University when the Wittenberg administration overruled the faculty personnel board and denied a faculty member tenure. The university was sanctioned in 2021 by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), for discontinuing eight academic programs and firing two tenured faculty members without, in the AAUP&#x27;s opinion, respecting faculty rights.

===Hamma Divinity School===
Luther Alexander Gotwald, Professor of Theology in the Hamma Divinity School that served as the theological department of the college, was famously tried for and unanimously acquitted of heresy by the board of directors at Wittenberg on April 4–5, 1893. The trial concerned many key issues that Evangelical Lutherans still debate today.

For decades, Hamma and Wittenberg were associated with the local English-speaking regional Lutheran synods in the Midwest.

In 1978, Hamma Divinity School merged with the nearby Evangelical Lutheran Theological Seminary (associated with Capital University) in the Bexley suburb of Columbus, Ohio, to form Trinity Lutheran Seminary.

==Residence life==

Wittenberg&#x27;s residence halls on campus are Tower Hall, Myers Hall, Firestine Hall, Ferncliff Hall, Woodlawn Hall, New Residence Hall, and Polis House. Each residence hall includes TV-lounges, ping-pong tables, vending machines, cooking appliances, student printers, and laundry facilities. The only residence halls without air conditioning include Woodlawn Hall, Ferncliff Hall, and Myers Hall. Some residence halls include a technology or computer lab within the buildings, including Woodlawn, Myers, and New Hall.

Myers Hall is the oldest, the first campus building when the university opened. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Myers Hall is four-stories tall, but does not include an elevator, as the build was finished in 1851. It has housed the University Honors Program for many years, but was eventually moved to Woodlawn Hall. Myers is currently offline, or unavailable for students to live in for the 2024-2025 academic year.

Right across from the University&#x27;s President and Provost&#x27;s residence, holds Ferncliff Hall with 151 students across four-floors. Including a vintage freight elevator, Ferncliff includes various amenities throughout the building and is in close proximity to the WittenBurbs (upperclassmen housing), Commencement Hollow, and Koch Hall.

Being closely located to the residence halls and Benham-Pence Student Center, the air conditioned and co-ed Firestine Hall is home to 220 students. Right outside of Firestine Hall includes recreational sports courts, including basketball and sand volleyball courts. 

Another residence hall known for its central location on campus is Woodlawn Hall, a four-floor building with no elevator. Previously known as Beta Theta Pi&#x27;s fraternity house until 1939, Woodlawn provides various amenities and houses the University Honors Program. 

The newest residence hall, New Hall, opened in 2006. It is centrally located on campus and in close proximity to the Benham-Pence Student Center, Thomas Library, and Blair Hall. New Hall is co-ed, includes 3-floors with an elevator, and houses the Ubuntu Themed Living Community. Ubuntu, or &quot;I am because we are,&quot; was created for students who seek an inclusive and diverse space of living, in specifically Black and Brown cultures. Students have compared New Hall to that of a hotel, given its interesting amenities. Previously, New Hall contained a higher tuition price than other residence halls on campus, but has since been equalized with the other six residence halls on campus since the COVID-19 pandemic beginning in 2020.

The Polis House was formerly the international residence hall on campus, and is now the Tiger Pride Themed Living Community, beginning in 2021. It is the gender-inclusive residence hall on campus, along with the first floor of Ferncliff Hall. Polis House is the smallest residence hall on campus, housing 30 students across all three floors, and contains no elevator.

The tallest building and residence hall on campus is Tower Hall, including 10 residential floors with two elevators, and is home for 230 students each year. Tower Hall includes various amenities and has a lively bottom-floor that includes a ping-pong table, laundry appliances, and a TV-lounge. Tower Hall is connected to, or adjacent with the University Theatre &amp; Dance building, Chakeres Theatre. 

Students who are at junior or senior standing have the option to live in the university-provided on-campus apartments or off-campus in apartments or university rental houses, as living on campus is required each year for full-time students. 

The Benham-Pence Student Center houses most of the university&#x27;s dining services. The main floor of the student center houses Post 95 which offers four different options, including Champ City Grill, Ward &amp; Wood Subs, The Pour, and Ezra&#x27;s (serving prepared-to-order stirfry). Founders Pub, in the basement of the student center, was opened in 2009. The Campus Dining Room is on the second floor of the Student Center along with the faculty dining room. Breakfast and lunch are also served on weekdays in the Barbara Deer Kuss Science Center&#x27;s &quot;Simply To Go&quot; cafe. Beginning in the 2024-2025 school year, all students (Freshmen-Senior) are required to select a meal plan along with their housing accommodations.

<text>Gloucester National Park is a national park in Western Australia, 281 km south of Perth and about 3 km from Pemberton.

This park contains the Gloucester Tree, a renowned karri tree. Visitors can climb up to a viewing platform 60 m above the ground, using the climbing pegs inserted into the tree. The tree and the park are named after the city of Gloucester, England in 1946.

The tree served as a fire lookout and had the platform, cabin and climbing pegs installed in 1947, it was one of eight lookout trees constructed in the area between 1937 and 1952.

By 1963, it was estimated that over 3,000 people had climbed the tree, and in 1973 the original wooden cabin was demolished and replaced with an aluminium and steel cabin and gallery.

Another attraction in the park is The Cascades, a cascade waterfall in Lefroy Brook.

<text>Goongarrie National Park is a national park in Western Australia, east of Perth and about north of Kalgoorlie.

The park was part of Goongarrie Station that was purchased by the state government in 1995. The area also includes the abandoned townsite of Goongarrie. The name comes from nearby Lake Gongarrie which is Indigenous Australian in origin and of unknown meaning.

Infrastructure in the park was upgraded in 2007 after it received $70,000 in funding from the government.

The park is dominated by arid zone woodlands and is situated along the mulga-eucalypt line. Species of acacia and eucalypt make up the bulk of the vegetation. The southern end of Lake Marmion can be found at the northern end of the park along with many smaller salt lakes and clay pans.

Goongarrie is the transition area between the Coolgardie and Murchison bioregions.

<doc id="102127" wikidata="Q1130247" url="?curid=102127" title="Coraopolis, Pennsylvania">
<text>Coraopolis () is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 5,559 at the 2020 census.

Coraopolis is located west of Pittsburgh along the Ohio River and to the east of the Pittsburgh International Airport. The borough has steep topography, numerous brick streets and many large, old houses. Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods is headquartered in Coraopolis, as is the American Bridge Company.

==History==
===Early history===
On April 3, 1769, Andrew Montour, an Indian interpreter who had provided service to English settlers during the French and Indian War, was granted a land patent for approximately of what would later become the borough of Coraopolis and Neville Island. However, there is no evidence that Montour ever lived on this tract. The first permanent white settler in Coraopolis was Capt. Robert Vance, who settled in the vicinity of Montour&#x27;s tract around 1773, just prior to the beginning of the American Revolution. Vance, a Virginian, had been a member of the regiment commanded by George Washington at the Braddock expedition during the French and Indian War. For the protection of himself and his neighbors, of whom several arrived within a few years, Vance had a log stockade built with a stone blockhouse to protect the area against Indian raids. This was known as Vance Fort (or Fort Vance). The site of the fort was around present-day Broadway and Chestnut streets, near Second Avenue. Over time the community grew and developed, and it became known as Middletown in the 1800s, either because it was situated midway between Pittsburgh and Beaver, Pennsylvania, or perhaps after an early settler named Alexander Middleton who supposedly ran &quot;Middleton&#x27;s Tavern&quot; in the area.

One of the most important early industries in the area was begun by the Watson family, English immigrants who arrived in America in 1830. The Watsons built a sawmill on the site of the former municipal building on Fifth Avenue. Later, they operated a much larger grist mill on the river bank at Mill Street, until 1887.

===Founding===
The borough was incorporated on June 7, 1886. It was previously known as a village under the name of Middletown, while the post office name was Vancefort. It was established in August 1861, and changed to Coraopolis in March 1886. Legend has it that the borough was named for a member of the Watson family, Cora Watson, who was born on February 2, 1870. However, an old newspaper uncovered by longtime resident and local historian Dr. Frank Braden, Jr. suggests it more likely took the appellation from a Greek word for &quot;maiden city&quot;. According to page 7 of the book &quot;Coraopolis&quot;, by Gia Tatone, Coraopolis Historical Society (2007), &quot;The newspaper [Dr. Frank Braden, Jr. uncovered] was simply called the &quot;News&quot; and was published in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania, on June 5, 1897. The newspaper discusses the confusion that was occurring with the post offices in regard to the name Middletown, because several other areas in the state of Pennsylvania shared the same name. With a borough now being established, the Reverend Josiah Dillon, a pioneer clergyman, suggested the name to be changed to Coraopolis. Dillon knew Greek and was also the first burgess (mayor) at the time. So he suggested combining &quot;&quot; meaning &#x27;maiden&#x27; and &quot;opolis&quot; meaning &#x27;city&#x27; (&#x27;maiden city&#x27;) to achieve &quot;Koreopolis&quot;. However, when Greek letters and pronunciation were turned to English, it is said the spelling therefore accidentally got changed.&quot; The borough was built on land then owned by James Harvey McCabe and when the borough charter was granted, he was elected first burgess. &quot;and, under his careful and interested administration the departments of the new government and were, in an astonishing short time, working with great lubricity and resulting high efficiency. As he took the lead in the matter of establishing the new form of government, so it was his energetic championing of the projected laying of the tracks of the Pittsburg and Lake Erie through the borough that made that enterprise possible, his active assistance in securing rights of way being an important factor in its success.&quot;

===Growth to modern day===
Community development in Coraopolis moved along gradually with the building of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad in 1877. Several Coraopolis residents were stockholders in this enterprise. Eventually the P&amp;LE spun off the Montour Railroad as a subsidiary to bring coal in from the many mines south of town. Its headquarters and main yard remained in Coraopolis. The Montour at its peak ran 50 miles to Clairton with mines all along the way. The railroad ran until the 1980s, when the coal ran out and it was closed. Its old right of way is now part of the Montour Trail.

In 1892, community development took off with the construction of the first high-speed electric street railway in the United States. The railway ran from downtown Pittsburgh through McKees Rocks, Neville Island and Coraopolis to Sewickley. Streetcars ran until 1955. Along with the railway came Consolidated Lamp and Glass Company to Coraopolis, moving from its location in Fostoria, Ohio. Consolidated Glass employed up to 350 people, and was located in Coraopolis from 1895 until 1963. Other Coraopolis residents worked for the new industries established on Neville Island. Shafer Bus Line was headquartered in Coraopolis and served the western part of Allegheny County south of the Ohio River until 1960, when it was bought out by the government agency PennDot, which continues to run buses between Coraopolis, the Airport and downtown Pittsburgh. Standard Steel Spring Company, which was bought out by North American Rockwell Steel Corporation, operated from 1900 until 1960, when it moved to Mishewaka, Indiana. The plant made springs, bumpers and frames for vehicles. It employed 10,000 men working three shifts a day seven days a week.

Coraopolis&#x27; first municipal building was built in 1897 on State Avenue and was used until 1929, when next building was constructed on Fifth Ave. Coraopolis dedicated a new municipal complex on Fourth Ave in 2017 that houses all municipal departments, including the police and fire stations.

Two significant contributions to modern educational practice took place in the area. In 1955, Dr. Harry Houtz published a six-year study in the &quot;National Education Journal&quot; demonstrating that phonics was a more effective way of teaching reading, and in 1957, Herbert Snell published his study of performance-based academic tracking in junior high, which became widely adopted. Coraopolis and Neville Township merged their schools to form Cornell School District in 1971, and all students reported to the new Cornell Educational Center in 1976.

Coraopolis is the birthplace of actors Michael Keaton and S. William Hinzman. Jerry Gibson, a Negro league baseball player, played here for the Coraopolis Grays. The corporate headquarters for American Bridge Company are located in Corapolis.

Coraopolis is experiencing a period of revitalization highlighted by new storefront businesses and façade improvements in the central business district. In 2017, two new brewpubs, a craft distillery, a coffee shop, a restaurant, and several other small businesses opened their doors. Coraopolis also shares a new athletic complex with neighboring Robinson and Moon Townships that will feature soccer, rugby, and lacrosse fields, when completed. The 1896 Richardsonian Romanesque train station is also being restored, and will become a community center and event space once completed.

===Surrounding and adjacent communities===

Situated along the southern bank of the Ohio River, Coraopolis has two land borders, including Moon Township to the south and west and Robinson Township to the southeast. Across the Ohio River&#x27;s back channel, Coraopolis is connected to Neville Island (Neville Township) via the Coraopolis Bridge to the northeast and is adjacent to the boroughs of Haysville, Glen Osborne, and Sewickley across the Ohio River&#x27;s confluence at the northeast end of Neville Island.

<text>Greenmount National Park is a national park in the locality of Greenmount, Western Australia, 22 km east of Perth.

It is one of the smaller national parks along the Darling Scarp and is a component of the Darling Range Regional Park.
Due to its proximity to John Forrest National Park, which used to be known as Greenmount National Park until 1928, and relationship to subsequent reserves to the south it is a vital scarp wildlife corridor.

Bus tours were available from Perth in 1933 with Hill&#x27;s Bus Tours offering passengers a tour around the park on Sundays in September. Beam Transport Ltd. offered a similar service through the Park to Mundaring Weir in 1937.

As a feature adjacent to the Helena River Valley it has significance in Aboriginal folklore, and also featured very early on in early European settler&#x27;s diaries.

Mountain Quarry is one of several blue stone quarries located within the park, popular with rock climbers and walkers. Vehicle access to the quarry site is restricted; however a car-park and picnic facilities including toilets are within walking distance of the main site, which is completely accessible on foot. There are several panels containing historical information about the site spread around as part of the popular Railway Reserves Heritage Trail, which runs close to the quarry.

The Boya/Koongamia leg of the Railway Reserves Heritage Trail, also known as the &quot;Bridle Trail&quot;, curves around the south-western edge of the park, crossing through the Mountain Quarry car-park and picnic area.


In the early 2000s significant bushfire damage occurred on the southern slopes of this park. Large fire-breaks bisect the park, serving as popular walking routes among locals.

The western and northern slopes, visible from Great Eastern Highway, have extensive &quot;Watsonia&quot; infestations.

In late 2005, the government authority in charge of the national park was taking steps to prevent vehicular access along the top of the ridge to the lookout due to vandalism and issues with residents adjacent to the park.

The park is situated along the side of Greenmount Hill and has views over the Swan Coastal Plain below and Perth to the west. The dominant vegetation in the park is eucalypts such as marri and wandoo along with an array of wild flowers and heathland along the northern slopes.
The hill is steep and contain several breakaways and rocky outcrops.

<text>Hassell National Park is a national park in the Great Southern region of Western Australia, southeast of Perth and north east of Albany.

Named after John Hassell, a retired sea captain, who was responsible for opening up extensive areas in the south of the state during the 1850s as he extended his pastoral leases east from Frankland as far as Jerramungup.

The park straddles the South Coast Highway between Manypeaks and Wellstead.

The site is regarded as an important ecological area as a result of it being a largely intact vegetation and wildlife corridor that serves to link the Mount Manypeaks and Waychinicup areas with the Cheynes Beach and Pallinup areas.

The park has no entry fee and has no facilities provided for visitors.

A population of the very rare Brown&#x27;s Banksia, composed of 100 to 200 plants, can be found within the confines of the park.

<text>Mirima National Park also commonly known as Hidden Valley National Park is a National Park in far northern Western Australia located at the eastern side of the Kimberley region. It is located approximately from Perth just outside the township of Kununurra.
The park covers a total area of and was declared a national park in 1982.

Unusual sandstone formations dominate the park and are often compared to the Bungle Bungles.

The area is of great significance to the local indigenous peoples, the &quot;Miriuwung&quot;, and several examples of rock art can be found within the park.

&quot;Mirima&quot; is the name given by the Miriwoong people to the area extending some 150 kilometres to the north and south, and 170 kilometres to the east and west from Kununurra.

Access to the park is via a sealed bitumen road and an entry fee to the park applies. Camping and fires within the park are not permitted. Facilities include toilets, tables, information shelters and three walk trails around the park.

<text>John Forrest National Park is a national park in the Darling Scarp, east of Perth, Western Australia. Proclaimed as a national park in November 1900, it was the first national park in Western Australia.

== Name ==
As early as 1898, the land was reserved for conservation and recreation. Two years later, it was named &quot;Greenmount National Park&quot;. It was still being identified as &quot;National Park&quot; in the late 1930s, and it was not until 1947 that the name change occurred to commemorate Sir John Forrest, the first Premier of Western Australia.

== Location ==
The park is on the edge of the Darling Scarp east of Perth, north of the Great Eastern Highway.
To the west is the suburb of Swan View, with Pechey Road as a natural western boundary. To the south of the Great Eastern Highway the suburbs adjacent are Darlington and Glen Forrest. To the east is Hovea.

== History ==
It was bisected by the Eastern Railway when it was constructed in the 1890s and rail traffic passed through until 1966, when the line was closed due to the opening of the Avon Valley route.
The alignment through the Swan View Tunnel and through the park was commonly known as the &quot;National Park&quot; railway line.

During the Great Depression of the 1930s many features near the main park buildings were built as part of relief employment. Some have been restored.

It was a popular railway excursion location while the railway was in existence (1890s to 1960s). Initially Hovea was the nearest railway station but in 1936 the National Park railway station was built. Also often photographed were National Park Falls, and the Hovea Falls.

After the railway line was closed and removed the formation became part of the Railway Reserves Heritage Trail vested in the Mundaring Shire Council. The section within the park is now known as the John Forrest Heritage Trail.

== Current conditions ==

While larger kangaroos remain, significant populations of smaller marsupials have been devastated by foxes, feral cats and dogs in this park.

Drought and dieback have affected the jarrah forest within the park. At the edges of the park, introduced species of weed and problematic vegetation threaten the integrity of the park. In some areas wildflowers remain a feature to the edge of the internal roads despite the changes.

Also with rationalising of staff within the Department of Environment and Conservation management, earlier levels of staffing on parks such as this one have been reduced to minimal levels.

Significant damaging bushfires occurred in the western and northern sections of the park in the 1990s and early 2000s. In November 2010 a bushfire, believed to have been deliberately lit, damaged a significant area of the park including part of the Eagle&#x27;s View trail.

At various stages parts of the park have been accessed by mountain bike activity.

==John Forrest Tavern==
John Forrest Wildflower Tavern and Restaurant was opened in 1978. It was centrally located within the park just uphill from the ranger&#x27;s office. It become a landmark for events such as car club rallies and orienteering clubs. The outside court yard was a popular tourist attraction as native birds and kangaroos, seeking food, approach close to the building.

The Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions closed the venue in 2022.

== Walking trails ==
John Forrest National Park has several walk trail options that cater for different abilities and fitness level. All walks start at the main picnic area. Walks include: 

* Christmas Tree Creek Walk ()
* Eagle View Walk Trail ()
* Glen Brook Walk ()
* Jane Brook Promenade ( loop)
* John Forrest Bridle Trail ()
* National Parks Falls Walk ()
* Wildflower Walk ()

<text>Kalamunda National Park is a national park in Western Australia, east of Perth, near the town of Kalamunda.

==Description==
The park is composed of typical Darling Scarp woodland including species of marri, jarrah and wandoo with a diverse understorey including a range of wildflowers.

Piesse Brook flows through the park before joining the Helena River, making the park and important catchment area for both the Helena and the Swan Rivers.

No fees apply to enter the park but facilities exist within the park for visitors apart from several walk trails including the northern end of the Bibbulmun Track.

==Important Bird Area==
The park lies within the Mundaring-Kalamunda Important Bird Area, so identified by BirdLife International because of its importance as a non-breeding season roost site and foraging base for long-billed black cockatoos.

<doc id="102133" wikidata="Q1722083" url="?curid=102133" title="Kalbarri National Park">
<text>Kalbarri National Park is located north of Perth, in the Mid West region of Western Australia.

The major geographical features of the park include the Murchison River gorge which runs for nearly on the lower reaches of the Murchison River. Spectacular coastal cliffs are located on the coast near the mouth of the Murchison River and the town of Kalbarri.

There is also an eponymous locality of the Shire of Northampton, but the boundaries of the national park and the locality are not identical.

==Geography==

Kalbarri National Park preserves the inland desert regions of red and white striped Tumblagooda sandstone east of the town of Kalbarri, particularly the lower reaches of the Murchison River and its gorge, as well as the mouth of the river by Meanarra Hill.

The western edge of the park protects the coastline south of the town which features cliffs more than high. The coastal area contains several wind and water eroded rock formations including a sea stack and a natural bridge.

==Climate==
The park is open all year round though temperatures can be extremely high from December through April. The park lies in the northernmost limits of the transition zone between a Mediterranean and a semi-arid climate. Winters are warm with moderate precipitation. Summers are hot and dry with temperatures that frequently exceed in the inland part of the park. Inland areas can often be more than higher than along the coast and in town. Monthly precipitation levels are low with most rain falling from May through August. Heavy rainfalls may cause the roads to the gorge to be closed.

==Flora==

The Kalbarri area is known for its diversity and extent of wildflowers. More than 800 species of wildflowers bloom from late winter through early summer with peak times in August and September. Twenty-one plant species are found only in the coastal cliff tops and gorge country predominantly in the National Park. One of the best known local plants is the Kalbarri catspaw, a small yellow or red plant that is usually seen on recently burnt country from August to September. Several orchids can only be seen in and near the park, including the Kalbarri spider orchid and the Murchison hammer orchid.

The small-petalled Beyeria or short-petalled Beyeria, once thought to be extinct, was re-discovered in the park in 1994. The population in the park is one of only three known populations.

==Fauna==

The park area has observation records for about 200 different animal species in the interior of the park along the Murchison River. More than 400 species have been recorded near the coast and around the town of Kalbarri. The threatened tammar wallaby was observed previously in the area but not lately.

Approximately 150 bird species have been observed including the emu (&quot;Dromaius novaehollandiae&quot;), osprey (&quot;Pandion haliaetus&quot;), wedge-tailed eagle (&quot;Aquila audax&quot;) and Australian pelican (&quot;Pelecanus conspicillatus&quot;). Some of the recorded mammal species in the interior include the western grey kangaroo (&quot;Macropus fuliginosus&quot;), short-beaked echidna (&quot;Tachyglossus aculeatus&quot;) and spinifex hopping mouse (&quot;Notomys alexis&quot;). The only observed bat in the park is the Finlayson&#x27;s cave bat (&quot;Vespadelus finlaysoni&quot;). The recorded reptile species include the thorny devil (&quot;Moloch horridus&quot;), western bearded dragon (&quot;Pogona minor&quot;) and central netted dragon (&quot;Ctenophorus nuchalis&quot;). The only observed amphibian is Günther&#x27;s toadlet (&quot;Pseudophryne guentheri&quot;). About 30 different arthropods have been recorded including a dragonfly called the Pilbara tiger (&quot;Ictinogomphus dobsoni&quot;) and the savanna black tree ant (&quot;Tetraponera punctulata&quot;).

==Activities==
The most popular activities are sightseeing, boating, fishing, picnicking and bushwalking. Other activities include abseiling in the gorge and horseback riding, as well as scuba diving, snorkelling, surfing and swimming in the Indian Ocean at Red Bluff Beach and the small beach at Pot Alley. From Kalbarri there are scenic cruises along the Murchison River and flights over Kalbarri National Park. Construction of the two Kalbarri Skywalk platforms are now completed and offer expansive views of the Murchison River Gorge and Kalbarri National Park.
==Facilities==
There are no campsites or other accommodations and no water available within the park boundaries. All overnight visitors must use the facilities in the town unless they are on a multi-day bushwalk or boat tour.

==Features==

<doc id="102134" wikidata="Q1729357" url="?curid=102134" title="Karijini National Park">
<text>Karijini National Park is an Australian national park centred in the Hamersley Ranges of the Pilbara region in the northwestern section of Western Australia. The park is located north of the Tropic of Capricorn, from the state&#x27;s capital city, Perth. Formerly known as Hamersley Range National Park, the park was officially renamed in 1991.

At , Karijini is the second largest national park in Western Australia (behind Karlamilyi National Park), with rock formations that are estimated at 2.5 billion years old. The ideal time to visit Karijini National Park is between May and September, during Australia&#x27;s late autumn, winter and early spring. The days are warm but the nights are cold. Summer temperatures which regularly reach in excess of make it less practical to visit, with added risk of bushfires.

The park is physically split into a northern and a southern half by a corridor containing the Hamersley and Robe River railway and the Marandoo iron ore mine. Tourist attractions such as gorges and waterfalls are located in the northern half of the park, accessible via sealed and gravel roads. There are no sealed access roads in the southern half. 

The park is served by the Paraburdoo Airport (PBO) located from Karijini National Park and Newman Airport (ZNE) is from Karijini National Park. Hire cars are available from both airports. Solomon Airport, located to the west services some of the nearby iron ore mines.

== History ==
The park is the traditional home of the Banyjima, Kurrama and Innawonga Aboriginal people. The Banyjima name for the Hamersley Range is , meaning &#x27;hilly place&#x27;. Evidence of their early occupation dates back more than 20,000 years. During that period, Aboriginal land management practices, such as fire-stick farming, resulted in a diversity of vegetation types and stages of succession that helped determine the nature of the plants and animals found in the park today.

A party led by explorer Francis Thomas Gregory explored the area in 1861. He named the Hamersley Range, on which the park is centred, after his friend Edward Hamersley.

== Climate ==
The park is located in the Pilbara region, and is mostly tropical semi-arid climate. In summer, thunderstorms and cyclones are common, bringing of rain annually. Temperatures on summer days frequently exceed , while winter nights can bring frost.

== Geology ==
Several gorges that flow north out of the parkincluding Dales, Kalamina, Wittenoom and Yampire Gorgesprovide notable displays of the rock layers:
* Banded iron formation – Brockman iron formation
* Dolomite – Wittenoom dolomite
* Shale – Mount McRae Shale

== Fauna ==

The park&#x27;s wildlife includes red kangaroos, euros, rock-wallabies, echidnas, geckos, goannas, bats, legless lizards and a large variety of birds and snakes, including pythons.

== Features ==

The park is most notable for its many gorges containing slot canyons, waterfalls and water holes with visitors sometimes swimming in the cold pools of water.

Hamersley Gorge is located in the northwestern region of the park, while Range Gorge is in the north, Munjina Gorge is in the east, and Hancock, Joffre, Knox, Red and Weano Gorges converge in the park&#x27;s centre.

While the park is fully open to the public, visitors are warned to exercise due caution when walking in and around the vicinity of Yampire and Wittenoom Gorges near the northern boundary of the park due to the presence of blue asbestosa known cancer-causing agent when inhaledwhich occurs in a number of the rock formations.

<doc id="102136" wikidata="Q37710" url="?curid=102136" title="Border Collie">
<text>The Border Collie is a British breed of herding dog of the collie type of medium size. It originates in the region of the Anglo-Scottish border, and descends from the traditional sheepdogs once found all over the British Isles. It is kept mostly as a working sheep-herding dog or as a companion animal. It competes with success in sheepdog trials. It has been claimed that it is the most intelligent breed of dog.

==History==

The Border Collie is descended from landrace collies, a type found widely in the British Isles. The name for the breed came from its probable place of origin along the Anglo-Scottish border. Mention of the &quot;collie&quot; or &quot;Colley&quot; type first appeared toward the end of the 19th century, although the word &quot;collie&quot; is older than this and has its origin in the Scots language. It is also thought that the word &#x27;collie&#x27; comes from the old Celtic word for useful. Many Border Collies today can be traced back to a dog known as Old Hemp.

In 1915, James Reid, Secretary of the International Sheep Dog Society (ISDS) in the United Kingdom first used the term &quot;border collie&quot; to distinguish those dogs registered by the ISDS from the Kennel Club&#x27;s collie (or Scotch collie, including the rough collie and smooth collie) which originally came from the same working stock but had developed a different, standardised appearance following introduction to the show ring in 1860 and mixture with different breeds.

===Old Hemp===
 Old Hemp, a tricolour dog, was born in Northumberland, England in September 1893 and died in May 1901. He was bred by Adam Telfer from Roy, a black and tan dog, and Meg, a black-coated, strong-eyed dog. Hemp was a quiet, powerful dog to which sheep responded easily. Many shepherds used him for stud and Hemp&#x27;s working style became the Border Collie style. All purebred Border Collies alive today can trace an ancestral line back to Old Hemp. He was believed to have sired as many as 200 pups over the span of his life.

===Wiston Cap===
Wiston Cap (b. 28 September 1963)&lt;ref name=&quot;http://db.kennel.dk/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is the dog that the International Sheep Dog Society (ISDS) badge portrays in the characteristic Border Collie herding pose. He was a popular stud dog in the history of the breed, and his bloodline can be seen in most bloodlines of the modern-day collie. Bred by W. S. Hetherington and trained and handled by John Richardson, Cap was a biddable and good-natured dog. His bloodlines all trace back to the early registered dogs of the studbook, and to J. M. Wilson&#x27;s Cap, whose name occurs 16 times within seven generations in his pedigree. Wiston Cap sired three Supreme Champions and is grand-sire of three others, one of whom was E. W. Edwards&#x27; Bill, who won the championship twice.

===Introduction to New Zealand and Australia===
Collies were listed as imports to New Zealand as early as 1858, but the type was not specified. In the late 1890s James Lilico (1861?–1945) of Christchurch, New Zealand, imported a number of working dogs from the United Kingdom. These included Hindhope Jed, a black, tan and white born in Hindhope, Scotland in 1895, as well as Maudie, Moss of Ancrum, Ness and Old Bob.

It is unclear whether Hindhope Jed was a descendant of Old Hemp. Born two years after him, she is mentioned in a &quot;British Hunts and Huntsmen&quot; article concerning a Mr John Elliot of Jedburgh:

Mr. Elliot himself is well known for his breed of collies. His father supplied Noble to the late Queen Victoria and it was from our subject that the McLeod got Hindhope Jed, now the champion of New Zealand and Australia.

On her departure to New Zealand, Hindhope Jed was already in pup to &quot;Captain&quot;, another of the then-new &quot;border&quot; strain. Hindhope Jed had won three trials in her native Scotland, and was considered to be the &quot;best to cross the equator&quot;.

In 1901 the King and Mcleod stud was created by Charles Beechworth King (b. 1855, Murrumbidgee, NSW), his brother and Alec McLeod at Canonbar, near Nyngan (north-west of Sydney), brought Hindhope Jed to Australia, where she enjoyed considerable success at sheepdog trials.

The New Zealand Heading Dog breed was developed from Border Collies.

==Description==


Border Collies are, on average, medium-sized dogs with a moderate amount of coat, which is often thick and prone to shedding. They have a double coat that varies from smooth to rough and is occasionally curled. While black and white is the most common colouring of the Border Collie, the breed appears in just about any colour and pattern known to occur in dogs. Some of these include black tricolour (black/tan/white), liver and white, and red tricolour (red/tan/white) which have also been seen regularly, and other colours such as blue, lilac, red merle, blue merle, brindle, and Australian red (also known as ee red, blonde, recessive red, or gold) which is seen less frequently. Some Border Collies may also have single-colour coats.

Eye colour varies from brown to green, and occasionally eyes of differing colour occur; this is usually seen with merles. This trait is known as heterochromia. The ears of the Border Collie are also variable — some have fully erect ears, some fully dropped ears, and others semi-erect ears (similar to those of the rough collie). 

Although working Border Collie handlers sometimes have superstitions about the appearance of their dogs (handlers may avoid mostly white dogs due to the unfounded idea that sheep will not respect a white or almost all white dog), in general, the American Border Collie Association considers a dog&#x27;s appearance to be irrelevant. Instead, it is considered more useful to identify a working Border Collie by its attitude and ability.

Dogs bred for show are more homogeneous in appearance than working Border Collies since to win in conformation showing they must conform closely to breed club standards that are specific on many points of the structure, coat, and colour. Kennel clubs specify, for example, that the Border Collie must have a &quot;keen and intelligent&quot; expression, and that the preferred eye colour is dark brown. In deference to the dog&#x27;s working origin, scars and broken teeth received in the line of duty are not to be counted against a Border Collie in the show ring. The males&#x27; height from withers comes from , females from .

It has been claimed to be the most intelligent breed of dog.

==Health==

===Life span===
A 2022 study in England of veterinary records found a life expectancy of 12.1 years, slightly higher than the 11.82 life expectancy for crossbreed dogs. A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.1 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

Leading causes of death in a 2004 Kennel Club survey were cancer (23.6%), old age (17.9%) and cerebral vascular afflictions (9.4%).

===Conditions===
Collie eye anomaly is an autosomal recessive condition caused by an autosomal recessive mutation in the NHEJ1 gene that affects Collies and related breeds, such as the Border Collie.

Two types of hearing loss occur in the breed. The first type is pigment associated and is found in Border Collie puppies, although the puppies can have congenital sensorineural deafness from birth as well. The second type is known as adult-onset hearing loss. These dogs have a normal auditory brainstem response test as pups but gradually lose their hearing some time between one and eight years of age. The American Border Collie Association&#x27;s Health &amp; Education Foundation (ABCA HEF) is supporting research into the genetic causes of this disease. Suspect regions of the genome have been identified, but the exact causal mutation(s) have not so far been located.

Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) is a rare but serious disease that is limited to show Border Collies. NCL results in severe neurological impairment and early death; afflicted dogs rarely survive beyond two years of age. The mutation causing the form of the disease found in Border Collies was identified by Scott Melville in the laboratory of Alan Wilton of the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales. There is no treatment or cure, but a DNA test is now available to detect carriers as well as affected dogs.

Trapped Neutrophil Syndrome (TNS) is a hereditary disease in which the bone marrow produces neutrophils (white cells) but is unable to effectively release them into the bloodstream. Affected puppies have an impaired immune system and will eventually die from infections they cannot fight. The mutation responsible for TNS has been found in Border Collies, in English working dogs, in show dogs that had originated in Australia and New Zealand, and in unrelated Australian working dogs. This indicates that the gene is widespread and probably as old as the breed itself. TNS was identified by Jeremy Shearman in the laboratory of Alan Wilton of the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales. There is no cure, but a DNA test is now available to detect carriers as well as affected dogs.

Other diseases found less commonly include juvenile cataracts, osteochondritis, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus and canine cyclic neutropaenia, carpal soft-tissue injury.

A syndrome of exercise-induced collapse similar to that seen in Labrador retrievers, otherwise termed Border Collie Collapse and triggered by episodes of collapse associated with periods of intense exercise has been described in Border Collies in North America, Europe and Australia; and is currently the subject of further investigation. Border Collie Collapse or &quot;the wobbles&quot; is a disease found in many herding/working breeds. The cause is currently unknown. Border Collie Collapse seems to be related to high-intensity exercises that are found to be particularly exciting to the individual dog. For example, some dogs cannot retrieve a tennis ball, as they find this activity highly stimulating, but can run for several miles with no symptoms of Border Collie Collapse. Symptoms commonly include disorientation, mental dullness, loss of attention, unsteady hind legs, dragging of hind legs, and ultimately the need to sit or lie down. Loss of consciousness and seizure-like trembling/spasms are not characteristics of Border Collie Collapse. There is no current diagnostic test or veterinary workup that can confirm Border Collie Collapse and the diagnosis is often given as a diagnosis of exclusion or based on clinical symptoms. There is no current treatment recommended, and it is advised to limit the episodes by avoiding the activities that trigger the collapse.

A study in the UK looking at clinical records found the Border Collie to have the highest prevalence of hepatic neoplasia. Border Collies were 2.67 times more likely to acquire the condition than other breeds.

The Border Collie is one of the more commonly affected breeds for a mutation in the MDR1 gene. This mutation results in the affected animal being more susceptible to negative effects of drugs at volumes that are otherwise safe. Common drugs such as doramectin and ivermectin will cause neurotoxicosis. The mutation has a frequency of 1–4.8% depending on the country.

==Breed standards==

There are two types of tests, or standards, to determine the breeding quality of a Border Collie: the original ISDS sheepdog trial and appearance.

===ISDS sheepdog trial===
The original test is the ISDS sheepdog trial. It is still used today, where a dog and handler collect groups of livestock and move them quietly around a course. There are certain standard elements to this test depending on the level: national or international. For both levels, sheep must be gathered as calmly as possible without being distressed. For a national competition, normally held between England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, trials run over a 400-yard course. International courses use a 400-yard course for the qualifying trials, but on the third and final day, trials are held in a course of 800 yards.

The international test involves a &quot;double fetch&quot;, where the sheepdog must gather 10 sheep from 800 yards away, bring them on an angle to the centre of the field, and then be sent back in another direction to gather another 10 sheep, also placed 800 yards from the handler. Five of those 20 sheep will have collars on, and at the end of a triangular drive, the sheep are gathered into a circular &quot;shedding ring&quot; and the 15 sheep without collars are driven away as the five collared sheep are kept inside the ring and then penned. Sheepdogs must be directed through obstacles at varying distance from the handler, and then the dog must demonstrate the ability to do work close at hand by penning the sheep and sorting them out.

==Registries==
=== United Kingdom ===

In the United Kingdom the dogs can be registered with the national Kennel Club like any other recognised breed; a breed society, the International Sheep Dog Society, registers only dogs with proven herding ability.

===United States===
The principal registry for Border Collies in the United States is the American Border Collie Association (ABCA), which is dedicated to the preservation of the traditional working dog. The breed was also recognised in 1995 by the American Kennel Club (AKC) after occupying the AKC&#x27;s Miscellaneous Class for over 50 years. The recognition was under protest from the majority of Border Collie affiliated groups, such as the United States Border Collie Club, which felt that emphasis on the breed&#x27;s working skills would be lost under AKC recognition. AKC registrations have gradually increased since recognition and by 2004 there were 1,984 new AKC registrations of Border Collies, with a further 2,378 for the year 2005. By contrast, the American Border Collie Association registers approximately 20,000 Border Collies annually. Because of the inherent tension between the goals of breeding to a working standard and to an appearance standard, the American Border Collie Association voted in 2003 that dogs who attained a conformation championship would be delisted from the ABCA registry, regardless of ability. Cross-registration is allowed between the working registries, and AKC accepts dogs registered with ABCA, but none of the working registries in the U.S. honor AKC pedigrees.

===Australia===
In Australia, Border Collies are registered with an Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) affiliated state control body or with a working dog registry. Between 2,011 and 2,701 ANKC pedigreed Border Collies have been registered with the ANKC each year since 1986. Inclusion on the ANKC affiliate&#x27;s main register allows Border Collies to compete in conformation, obedience, agility, tracking, disc dog, herding and other ANKC-sanctioned events held by an ANKC affiliated club, while inclusion on the limited register prohibits entry in conformation events. The ANKC provides a breed standard; however, this applies to conformation events only and has no influence on dogs entering performance events. Non-ANKC pedigreed dogs may also be eligible for inclusion on an ANKC associate or sporting register and be able to compete in ANKC performance or herding events. Agility organisations such as the Agility Dog Association of Australia (ADAA) have their own registry which allows the inclusion of any dog wishing to compete in their events.

===Canada===
In Canada, Agriculture Canada has recognised the Canadian Border Collie Association as the registry under the Animal Pedigree Act for any Border Collie that is designated as a &quot;Pure Breed&quot; in Canada.

The criteria used are based on herding lineage rather than appearance. It is a two-tiered registry in that dogs imported that are registered with a foreign Kennel Club that does hold conformation shows are given a &quot;B&quot; registration, whereas those that come directly from other working registries are placed on the &quot;A&quot; registry.

Recently, the Canadian Kennel Club has polled its members to decide if Border Collies should be included on the CKC &quot;Miscellaneous List&quot;. This designation would allow Border Collie owners the ability to compete in all CKC events, but the CKC would not be the registering body. People who compete in performance events support the move. The CBCA is against this designation.

===South Africa===
The registration of working sheepdogs in South Africa is the responsibility of the South African Sheepdog Association. ISDS-registered dogs imported into the country can be transferred onto the SASDA register. Dogs not registered can become eligible for registration by being awarded a certificate of working ability by a registered judge. Occasionally they will facilitate the testing of dogs used for breeding, for hip dysplasia and collie eye anomaly, to encourage the breeding of dogs without these genetic flaws.

===Turkey===
The registration of working Border Collies in Turkey is the province of the Border Collie Dernegi (Turkish Border Collie Association) established in 2007.

===Elsewhere===
The Border Collie breed is also recognised as the prime sheepdog by the International Stock Dog Federation (ISDF), based in Piccadilly, London, UK.

==Activities==
Border Collies are one of the most popular breeds for dog agility competitions. They also excel at competitive obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and sheepdog trials and herding events.

==Livestock work==
Working Border Collies can take direction by voice and by whistle at long distances when herding. Their great energy and herding instinct are still used to herd a variety of animals, from the traditional sheep and cattle, to free-range poultry, pigs, and ostriches. They are also used to remove unwanted wild birds from airport runways, golf courses, and other public and private areas.

Shepherds in the UK have taken the most critical elements of herding and incorporated them into a sheepdog trial. The first recorded sheepdog trials were held in Bala, North Wales, in 1873. These competitions enable farmers and shepherds to evaluate possible mates for their working dogs, but they have developed a sport aspect as well, with competitors from outside the farming community also taking part.

In the US, the national sanctioning body for these competitions is the USBCHA. In the UK it is the International Sheep Dog Society, in Canada the Canadian Border Collie Association (CBCA) and in South Africa it is the South African Sheepdog Association.

===Dog sports===
They perform well at some higher jump heights at dog agility competitions, so much so that in England, competitions often include classes for ABC dogs, &quot;Anything But Collies&quot;.

The Border Collie&#x27;s speed, agility, and stamina have allowed them to dominate in dog activities like flyball and disc dog competitions. Their trainability has also given them a berth in dog dancing competitions.

Border Collies have a highly developed sense of smell and with their high drive make excellent and easily motivated tracking dogs for tracking trials. These trials simulate the finding of a lost person in a controlled situation where the performance of the dog can be evaluated, with titles awarded for successful dogs. Border Collies are used as search dogs in mountain rescue in Britain. They are particularly useful for searching large areas of hillside and avalanche debris. Hamish MacInnes believed that dark-coated dogs are less prone to snow blindness.

==Research==
The impressive intelligence of the Border Collie has made it a viable subject for research. In particular, the Georgia Institute of Technology&#x27;s FIDO (Facilitating Interactions for Dogs with Occupations) project demonstrated the ability of intelligent dogs to communicate with humans. In particular, Professor Melody Jackson, director of the institute&#x27;s BrainLab, instrumented a Border Collie named Sky to activate a sensor worn by the dog which allowed Sky to communicate in audible English with its handler. One intent was to allow service dogs to warn their owners of impending danger, or to alert others to emergency situations involving their handler, especially those situations which might have resulted in the incapacitation of their handler.
