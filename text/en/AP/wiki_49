<text>Postal codes used in the United Kingdom, British Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies are known as postcodes (originally, postal codes). They are alphanumeric (the UK is one of only 11 countries or territories to use alphanumeric codes out of the 160 postcode using members of the ICU) and were adopted nationally between 11 October 1959 and 1974, having been devised by the General Post Office (Royal Mail).

The system was designed to aid in sorting mail for delivery. It uses alphanumeric codes to designate geographic areas. A full postcode identifies a group of addresses (typically around 10) or a major delivery point. It consists of an outward code and inward code. The outward code indicates the area and district, while the inward code specifies the sector and delivery point.

The initial postcode system evolved from named postal districts introduced in London and other large cities from 1857. Districts in London were then subdivided in 1917, with each allocated a distinct number, which extended to other cities by 1934. The territory of the UK is broken down into 121 postcode areas. Each postcode area contains multiple post towns and districts. Postcode areas are mnemonically named after the area&#x27;s major post town (such as TR for TRuro) although some are named after smaller towns or regional areas.

Postcodes have since been additionally used in various applications. Postcodes help calculate insurance premiums, designate destinations in route planning software, and serve as aggregation units in census enumeration. The Postcode Address File (PAF) database stores and updates the boundaries and address data for around 29 million addresses, ensuring accurate delivery and extensive utility beyond postal services.

== Overview ==
=== Structure ===
A full postcode is known as a &quot;postcode unit&quot; and designates an area with several addresses or a single major delivery point. The structure of a postcode is two alphanumeric codes that show, first, the post town and, second, a small group of addresses in that post town. The first alphanumeric code (the outward code or outcode) has between two and four characters and the second (the inward code or incode) always has three characters. The outcode indicates the postcode area and postcode district. It consists of one or two letters, followed by one digit, two digits, or one digit and one letter. This is followed by a space and then the incode which indicates the postcode sector and delivery point (usually a group of around 10-15 addresses, but can vary). The incode (always three characters), starts with a number (denoting a sector within the district), and ends with two letters (denoting delivery points which are allocated to streets, sides of a street or individual properties).

=== Postcode area names ===
Postcode areas are usually, but not always, named after a major town or city – such as B for Birmingham. Some are named after a smaller town (e.g. Southall postcode area is UB after Uxbridge) or a combination of towns (e.g. SM appears to be named after Sutton and Morden). A small number are regional – such as HS for the Outer Hebrides, FY for Fylde (the region around Blackpool) and ME for the Medway conurbation, with Rochester as its main post town. In the case of London (a Post Town), there is not a single &quot;London&quot; postcode area (such as &quot;LO&quot;); rather there are eight (N, E, EC, SE, SW, W, WC and NW) reflecting the preceding system for coding London based on compass points. In the case of Northern Ireland, the entire province has a single postcode area BT (named for Belfast). The mnemonic features various combinations - most commonly, first two letters (CH for CHester); first and last letters (BH for BournemoutH); first and key syllable letters (IV for InVerness). Postcodes generally do not align with historical county or local authority boundaries, and can also cross national boundaries (e.g. the CH and TD postcode areas).

=== Postcode districts and numbering ===
Each postcode area contains a number of post towns and postcode districts. All districts are defined by either one or two digits (AA9 or AA99); in London (only), some districts are additionally defined by one digit and one letter (A9A or AA9A).

As a general rule, the central part of the town/city the postcode area is named after will have the number 1 e.g. B1 (central Birmingham) – but there a limited number of postcode areas that start 0 or 10, e.g. SL0 and AB10. Croydon uniquely has no CR1 despite having CR0 and CR2-CR10 (an unintended outcome from the initial pilot of three letter postcode areas, where &quot;CRO&quot; for Croydon was transferred to the new format and became CR0, rather than CR1). Large post towns are generally numbered from the centre outward such that outlying parts have higher numbered districts. In most post towns, the postcode &quot;aa1 1AA&quot; was allocated to the crown or principal post office. These are increasingly defunct, as post offices have closed or moved.

Alternatively, but less commonly, post towns and postcode districts within the area may be numbered according to a different pattern -

* geographical direction (e.g. the Outer Hebrides postcode area HS, where the districts are numbered from north to south)
* alphabetical order of district sub-offices, which is used only in London postcode areas (e.g. E2 is Bethnal Green, E3 is Bow, E4 is Chingford etc., which results in intuitive anomalies such as SE1 and SE2 being far from neighbours, with SE1 being large part of Central London south of the Thames (Waterloo and the borough of Southwark) and SE2 covering Abbey Wood at the far eastern end of the Elizabeth Line.
* clusters particularly if the postcode area encompasses several major towns or cities (e.g. S postcode area with Sheffield S1-S36, Chesterfield S40-S49, Rotherham S60-S65, Barnsley S70-S75 and Worksop S80-S81)
* earlier districts where preceding postal districts have been adopted or translated into the current system (such as Glasgow&#x27;s &quot;compass points&quot;) - see Earlier Postal Districts.

Numbering of postcode districts is normally consecutive, starting from &quot;aa1&quot; (e.g. Halifax which has seven districts numbered consecutively HX1 to HX7), but this is not universal. Non-consecutive numbering can arise when geographic realities are faced and consecutive numbering would be potentially misleading or unhelpful, or when new districts are created or added/removed from the postcode area.

* geographic reality: particularly in larger postcode areas, the scale of the districts prevents consecutive numbering e.g. NE postcode area&#x27;s NE50-PH60 are not allocated due to the substantial distance between NE49 (Haltwhistle) and the next district to be numbered (Morpeth, which was numbered NE61 rather than NE50), recognising the geographic separation of districts in the west (up to NE49) from those to the north (NE61 upwards).
* new postcode districts: new postcode districts are occasionally created, usually due to increased demand for addresses following housing/business development and exhaustion of available postcodes for the existing district. There appear to be no clear rules for numbering new districts. If no sequential numbers are available, then new non-consecutive numbers are allocated. For example, in the CV postcode area, the CV47 district was formed in 1999 from parts of the CV23 and CV33 districts, where the highest numbered district then allocated was CV37.
* transfer of postcode districts: postcodes districts can be transferred for operational reasons e.g. PH49 and PH50 postcode districts which resulted from the transfer and recoding of PA39 and PA40 districts (PH39 and PH40 were already allocated although PH45-PH48 were not allocated). This also occurred with the creation of the HS postcode area, the only new geographic postcode area created since 1973, from the previous PA80 to PA87 districts.

London uniquely uses letters for subdivisions of some of its postcode districts (E1, N1, W1, WC1, WC2, EC1-EC4, NW1, SE1, SW1) with letters used substantively in three areas: W (W1), WC (WC1 and WC2) and EC (EC1-EC4), these being the most central areas with the densest concentration of addresses. These are effectively postcode districts in their own right, and could have been given double digit numbers (e.g. for WC in the range WC10-WC19 and WC20-WC29). The districts are geographically extremely small. Using double digit numbering may have encountered resistance due to their &quot;micro-size&quot; and also due to the long-standing use of &quot;WC1&quot; etc. which signified in some cases a cultural or wealth status which may have been diluted or lost if re-coded from WC1 to, say, WC15. Even if London had dropped the initial compass points systems to create a single post code area, the challenge of the large number of districts (169) would require a bespoke numbering system:

Accordingly, many postcode districts are not physically contiguous, despite the inference from their numbering. Likewise, the centrality of a postcode district within a postcode area cannot be reliably inferred from the postcode alone. See postcode area.

=== Postcode use ===
Postcodes have been adopted for a wide range of purposes in addition to aiding the sorting of mail: for calculating insurance premiums, designating destinations in route planning software and as the lowest level of aggregation in census enumeration. The boundaries of each postcode unit and within these the full address data of currently about 29 million addresses (delivery points) are stored, maintained and periodically updated in the Postcode Address File database.

Theoretically, deliveries can reach their destination using the house number (or name if the house has no number) and postcode alone; however, this is against Royal Mail guidelines, which request the use of a full address.

==History==
===Earlier postal districts===
====London====

The London post town covers 40% of Greater London. On inception (in 1857/8), it was divided into ten postal districts: EC (East Central), WC (West Central), N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, and NW. The S and NE sectors were later abolished. In 1917, as a wartime measure to improve efficiency, each postal district was subdivided into sub-districts each identified by a number; the area served directly by the district head office was allocated the number 1; the other numbers were allocated alphabetically by delivery office, e.g. N2 East Finchley delivery office, N3 Finchley delivery office, N4 Finsbury Park delivery office etc. Since then these sub-districts have changed little.

Some older road signs in Hackney still show the North East (NE) sector/district.

====Other large cities and towns====

Following the successful introduction of postal districts in London, the system was extended to other large towns and cities. Liverpool was divided into Eastern, Northern, Southern and Western districts in 1864/65, and Manchester and Salford into eight numbered districts in 1867/68.

In 1917, Dublin—then still part of the United Kingdom—was divided into numbered postal districts. These continue in use in a modified form by An Post, the postal service of the Republic of Ireland. In 1923, Glasgow was divided in a similar way to London, with numbered districts preceded by a letter denoting the compass point (C, W, NW, N, E, S, SW, SE).

In January 1932 the Postmaster General approved the designation of some predominantly urban areas into numbered districts. In November 1934 the Post Office announced the introduction of numbered districts (short postal codes) in &quot;every provincial town in the United Kingdom large enough to justify it&quot;. Pamphlets were issued to each householder and business in ten areas notifying them of the number of the district in which their premises lay. The pamphlets included a map of the districts, and copies were made available at local head post offices. The public were &quot;particularly invited&quot; to include the district number in the address at the head of letters.

A publicity campaign in the following year encouraged the use of the district numbers. The slogan for the campaign was &quot;For speed and certainty always use a postal district number on your letters and notepaper&quot;. A poster was fixed to every pillar box in the affected areas bearing the number of the district and appealing for the public&#x27;s co-operation. Every post office in the numbered district was also to display this information. Printers of Christmas cards and stationery were requested to always include district numbers in addresses, and election agents for candidates in the upcoming general election were asked to ensure they correctly addressed the 100 million items of mail they were expected to post. Businesses were issued with a free booklet containing maps and listings of the correct district number for every street in the ten areas.

The ten areas were:
*Birmingham
*Brighton/Hove
*Bristol
*Edinburgh
*Glasgow
*Leeds/Bradford
*Liverpool
*Manchester/Salford
*Newcastle upon Tyne
*Sheffield

For example, Toxteth was &quot;Liverpool 8&quot;. A single numbering sequence was shared by Manchester and Salford: letters would be addressed to Manchester 1 or Salford 7 (lowest digits, respectively). Some Birmingham codes were sub-divided with a letter, such as &quot;Great Barr, Birmingham 22&quot; or &quot;Birmingham 22a&quot;, as can still be seen on many older street-name signs.

===Modern postcode system===
The Post Office experimented with electromechanical sorting machines in the late 1950s. These devices presented an envelope to an operator, who would press a button indicating which bin to sort the letter into. Postcodes were suggested to increase the efficiency of this process by removing the need for the sorter to remember the correct sorting for as many places. In January 1959 the Post Office analysed the results of a survey on public attitudes towards the use of postal codes, choosing a town in which to experiment with codes. The envisaged format was a six-character alphanumeric code with three letters designating the geographical area and three numbers to identify the individual address. On 28 July Ernest Marples, the Postmaster General, announced that Norwich had been selected, and that each of the 150,000 private and business addresses would receive a code by October. Norwich had been selected as it already had eight automatic mail sorting machines in use. The original Norwich format consisted of &quot;NOR&quot;, followed by a space, then a two-digit number (which, unlike the current format, could include a leading zero), and finally a single letter (instead of the two final letters in the current format).

In October 1965, Tony Benn as Postmaster General announced that postal coding was to be extended to the rest of the country in the next few years.

On 1 May 1967 postcodes were introduced in Croydon. The many postcodes for central Croydon began with &quot;CRO&quot;, while those of the surrounding post towns with CR2, CR3 and CR4. The uniform system of a set of three final characters after the space (such as 0AA, known as the inward code) was adopted. This was to be the beginning of a ten-year plan, costing an estimated £24 million. Within two years it was expected that full coding would be used in Aberdeen, Belfast, Brighton, Bristol, Bromley, Cardiff, Coventry, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Newport, Reading, Sheffield, Southampton and the Western district of London. By 1967, codes had been introduced to Aberdeen, Southampton, Brighton and Derby. In 1970, codes were introduced to the London Western and North Western postal districts. In December 1970, much Christmas mail was postmarked with the message &quot;Remember to use the Postal Code&quot; although codes were used to sort mail in only a handful of sorting offices.

During 1971, occupants of addresses began to receive notification of their postcode. Asked in the House of Commons about the completion of the coding exercise, the Minister of State for Posts and Telecommunications (whose role superseded that of Postmaster General in 1969), Sir John Eden, stated that it was expected to be completed during 1972. The scheme was finalised in 1974 when Norwich was completely re-coded but the scheme tested in Croydon was sufficiently close to the final design for it to be retained, with CRO standardised as CR0 (district zero) thus removing the need to create a CR1 district.

A quirk remained: the central Newport (Gwent) area was allocated NPT at a similar time to Croydon becoming CRO, and surrounding areas were (as today) allocated NP1–NP8. NPT lasted until the end of 1984 when it was recoded NP9.

Girobank&#x27;s GIR 0AA was the last domestic postcode with a fully alphabetical outward code. That code no longer exists in the Royal Mail&#x27;s PAF system, but was taken over by the bank&#x27;s current owners, Santander UK.

====Adaptation of earlier systems into national system====
When the national postcode system was introduced, many existing postal districts were incorporated into it, so that postcodes in Toxteth (Liverpool 8) start with L8. The districts in both Manchester and Salford gained M postcodes, so Salford 7 became M7 and so on (and similarly in Brighton and Hove, both using the prefix BN). The old coding lives on in a small number of street signs with (for example) &quot;Salford 7&quot; at the bottom. In other cases, the district numbers were replaced with unrelated numbers. In Glasgow many of its G-prefixed numbers are not used following the transposition of the earlier compass point districts to &quot;G&quot; districts: C1 became G1, W1 became G11, N1 became G21, E1 became G31, S1 became G41, SW1 became G51, and so on. In London (as postally defined), 1917-created postal districts are mapped unchanged today despite Greater London, created in April 1965, covering a much larger administrative area. The London post town covers 40% of Greater London and the remaining 60% of Greater London&#x27;s area has postcodes referring to 13 other post towns. Additionally, there were too few postcodes to adequately cover districts in central London (particularly in the WC and EC areas), so these were subdivided with a letter suffix rather than being split into new numbered districts so as to retain the familiar codes.

====GB postcodes available as OpenData====
Prior to 1 April 2010, the Royal Mail licensed use of the postcode database for a charge of about £4,000 per year. Following a campaign and a government consultation in 2009, the Ordnance Survey released Code-Point Open, detailing each current postcode in Great Britain together with a geo-code for re-use free of charge under an attribution-only licence (Open Government Licence as part of OS OpenData).

====Postcodes linked to a variety of UK geographies==== 
The Office for National Statistics (ONS Geography) maintains and publishes a series of freely available, downloadable postcode products that link all current and terminated UK postcodes to a range of administrative, health, statistical and other geographies using the Code-Point Open grid reference.

==Formatting==
===Overview===
The postcodes are alphanumeric, and are (possibly uniquely) variable in length: ranging from six to eight characters (including a space). Each postcode is divided into two parts separated by a single space: the &quot;outward code&quot; and the &quot;inward code&quot; respectively. The &quot;outward code&quot; includes the &quot;postcode area&quot; and the &quot;postcode district&quot;, respectively. The &quot;inward code&quot; includes the &quot;postcode sector&quot; and the &quot;postcode unit&quot; respectively. Examples of postcodes are &quot;SW1W 0NY&quot;, &quot;PO16 7GZ&quot;, &quot;GU16 7HF&quot;, and &quot;L1 8JQ&quot;.

===Outward code===
The outward code is the part of the postcode before the single space in the middle. It is between two and four characters long. Examples of outward codes are &quot;L1&quot;, &quot;W1A&quot;, &quot;RH1&quot;, &quot;RH10&quot; or &quot;SE1P&quot;. A few outward codes are non-geographic, not divulging where mail is to be sent. These postcodes cannot be used for navigation purposes.

====Postcode area====
The postcode area is part of the outward code. The postcode area is either one or two characters long and is alphabetical, with there being 121 such areas. Examples of postcode areas are &quot;L&quot; for Liverpool, &quot;RH&quot; for Redhill and &quot;EH&quot; for Edinburgh. A postal area may cover a wide area, for example &quot;RH&quot; covers various settlements in eastern Surrey and north eastern West Sussex, and &quot;BT&quot; (Belfast) covers the whole of Northern Ireland.

====Postcode district====
The postcode district is one digit, two digits or a digit followed by a letter.

===Inward code===
The inward code is the part of the postcode after the single space in the middle. It is three characters long. The inward code assists in the delivery of post within a postal district. Examples of inward codes are &quot;0NY&quot;, &quot;7GZ&quot;, &quot;7HF&quot;, or &quot;8JQ&quot;.

====Postcode sector====
The postcode sector is made up of a single digit (the first character of the inward code). Most postcode areas do not use all of the sectors 0–9 in order to allow for the possibility of more sectors being added in the face of new development. Rather, in the initial allocation of postcodes, neighbouring postcode districts were often assigned to contain the ten sectors between them. For example, across the three postcode districts BS6-8 (which are next to each other in north west Bristol), sectors 1-4 were assigned to BS8, sectors 5-7 were assigned to BS6, and sectors 8-9 and 0 were assigned to BS7 (more recent changes have resulted in all three of those areas now having a sector 9).

====Postcode unit====
The postcode unit is two characters added to the end of the postcode sector. A postcode unit generally represents a street, part of a street, a single address, a group of properties, a single property, a sub-section of the property, an individual organisation or (for instance Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency) a subsection of the organisation. The level of discrimination is often based on the amount of mail received by the premises or business.

===Validation===
The format is as follows, where A signifies a letter and 9 a digit:

Notes:
* As all formats end with 9AA, the first part of a postcode can easily be extracted by ignoring the last three characters.
* Areas with only single-digit districts: BL, BR, FY, HA, HD, HG, HR, HS, HX, JE, LD, SM, SR, WC, WN, ZE (although WC is always subdivided by a further letter, e.g. WC1A)
* Areas with only double-digit districts: AB, LL, SO (for AB this arose from decoding of the original five districts AB1-AB5 by adding a second digit, to enable additional postcodes to become available, thus AB1 was divided into AB10-AB16).
* Areas with a district &#x27;0&#x27; (zero): BL, BS, CM, CR, FY, HA, PR, SL, SS (BS is the only area to have both a district 0 and a district 10)
* The following central London single-digit districts have been further divided by inserting a letter after the digit and before the space: EC1–EC4 (but not EC50), SW1, W1, WC1, WC2 and parts of E1 (E1W), N1 (N1C and N1P), NW1 (NW1W) and SE1 (SE1P).
* The letters &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;V&quot; and &quot;X&quot; are not used in the first position.
* The letters &quot;I&quot;, &quot;J&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; are not used in the second position.
* The only letters to appear in the third position are &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, P, S, T, U&quot; and &quot;W&quot; when the structure starts with A9A.
* The only letters to appear in the fourth position are &quot;A, B, E, H, M, N, P, R, V, W, X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; when the structure starts with AA9A.
* The final two letters do not use &quot;C, I, K, M, O&quot; or &quot;V&quot;, so as not to resemble digits or each other when hand-written.
* Postcode districts are one of ten digits: 0 to 9, with 0 only used once 9 has been used in a post town, save for Croydon (see above).
* Postcode sectors can also be one of ten digits: 0 to 9, though in some postcode areas the 0 is the beginning of the sequence (for example in LE), while in other areas it is the end of the sequence (i.e. 10, as in CV).

A postcode can be validated against a table of all 1.7 million postcodes in Code-Point Open. The full delivery address including postcode can be validated against the Royal Mail Postcode Address File (PAF), which lists 29 million valid delivery addresses, constituting most (but not all) addresses in the UK. A regular expression for validating UK postcodes is specified in the British Standards document BS 7666.

===Post towns===
All or part of one or more postcode districts are grouped into post towns. Larger post towns may use more than one postcode district, for example Crawley uses RH10 and RH11. In a minority of cases, a single number can cover two or more post towns – for example, the WN8 district includes Wigan and Skelmersdale post towns; and the GL17 district contains five post towns.

==Special cases==
===Crown dependencies===
The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man established their own postal administrations separate from the UK in 1969. Despite this, they adopted the UK-format postcodes in 1993–94: Guernsey using GY, the Isle of Man using IM, and Jersey using JE.

The independent jurisdiction of Sark was assigned a unique postcode district GY10 in 2011 to differentiate it from Alderney. The CEO of Guernsey Post, Boley Smillie, said &quot;this has been a long time coming&quot; and &quot;... Sark should have had its own identity back then [when postcodes were adopted in 1993]&quot;.

===British Overseas Territories===

Some of the British Overseas Territories have postcodes that broadly follow the format of the UK postcode system or, in Gibraltar&#x27;s case, adopts the UK format:

These were introduced because mail was often sent to the wrong place, e.g., to St Helena instead of St Helens, Merseyside or St Helens, Isle of Wight. and to Edinburgh instead of Edinburgh, Tristan da Cunha, and many online companies would not accept addresses without a postcode. Mail from the UK continues to be treated as international, not inland, and sufficient postage must be used.

Bermuda has developed its own postcode system, with unique postcodes for street and PO Box addresses, as have the Cayman Islands, Montserrat and the British Virgin Islands. Montserrat recently introduced postal codes, and a system has been under consideration in Gibraltar with the code GX11 1AA being introduced as the generic postcode for the territory in the interim.

The separate postal code systems for those territories are shown below:
The British Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia in Cyprus use Cypriot postal codes for civilian use. The British military use BFPO addresses.

=== British Forces Post Office (BFPO)===

The British Forces Post Office (BFPO) provides a postal service to HM Forces separate from that provided by Royal Mail in the United Kingdom, with BFPO addresses used for the delivery of mail in the UK and around the world. BFPO codes such as &quot;BFPO 801&quot; serve the same function as postal codes for civilian addresses, with the last line of the address consisting of &quot;BFPO&quot; followed a space and a number of 1 to 4 digits.

For consistency with the format of other UK addresses, in 2012 BFPO and Royal Mail jointly introduced an optional alternative postcode format for BFPO addresses, using the new non-geographic postcode area &quot;BF&quot; and the notional post town &quot;BFPO&quot;. Each BFPO number is assigned to a postcode in the standard UK format, beginning &quot;BF1&quot;. Inward codes are assigned: 0 – Germany, 1 – UK, 2 – Rest of Europe, 3 – Rest of World, 4 – Ships and Naval Parties, 5 – Rest of World, Operations and Exercises, 6 – Rest of World, Operations and Exercises. The database was released commercially in March 2012 as part of the Royal Mail Postal Address File (PAF). A postcode is not required if the traditional &quot;BFPO nnnn&quot; format is used.

===Non-geographic postcodes===
Overview: Almost all postcodes areas and almost all postcodes apply to a geographic area (buildings or streets) but some (areas, districts and specific postcodes) are used only for sorting/routing and thus cannot be used for identifying location, estimating distance or route finding in SatNav systems. They are commonly termed “non-geographic” postcodes in the sense that they refer not to physical addresses but to specific recipients (who have made arrangements for the delivery of incoming mail).

&quot;Non-geographic&quot; postcodes are used for various purposes, many of which were introduced after, or have significantly evolved since, the introduction of the current post code system, including: Admail, &quot;bulk mail&quot; or large volumes (government and business), centralised scanning of inward mail, competitions, parcel returns, direct marketing and PO boxes. They are also referred to as &quot;business service indicator addresses&quot;.

Some may be defunct or transferred e.g. Jobcentre typically had the aa98 or aa99 district in each postcode area but each office is now allocated a specific post code in the WV98 and WV99 districts, with the mail digitally scanned after delivery). A limited number are shared with geographic postcode districts, but are differentiated by their post town.

These postcodes cover -

* Post boxes: e.g. in the Brighton BN postcode area, BN50-BN52 are allocated to PO Boxes in Brighton, Rottingdean and Hove.
* Post boxes in London: London postcode districts ending in -P, such as SE1P, are usually allocated to PO Boxes (inconsistently, other letters are also used, and -P has been allocated to geographic addresses, such as SW1P).
* Postcode district: many geographic postcode areas also contain postcode districts that are &quot;non-geographic&quot; and are allocated to specific recipients which are government departments or commercial businesses (e.g. WV98 and WV99 for the Department of Work and Pensions correspondence.). These are referred to as Large User (LU) in the Postcode Address File.
* Postcode area BF: BF is entirely non-geographic (see above).
* Postcode area BX: BX is entirely non-geographic, with all its codes independent of the location of the recipient.
* Postcode area XX: the XX postcode area is non-geographic and is allocated for parcel returns of large volume online retailers (and was used for medical sample testing during the COVID pandemic).

Numbering rules: There appear to be no binding rules publicly available for numbering of non-geographic districts, and therefore can be numbered anywhere in the range 0 to 99, but many such districts are allocated a number higher than the currently existing postcode districts and often in the range 90-99 (several government departments use the AA98 or AA99 district in a number of postcode areas) - retrieved from PAF file, List of postcode areas in the United Kingdom. This is possible in most postcode areas as only a very small number have allocated geographic districts in that number range (B90-B98, BT92-BT94 and M90 seem to be the only geographic districts in this range). However, there are many non-geographic districts numbered outside this range (e.g. American Express has the postcode district BN88; in Glasgow G58 is allocated to National Savings, as part of a mnemonic postcode G58 1SB, though it is located in G43 postcode district).

Significant addressees: Some postcodes in the &quot;non-geographic&quot; range 90-99 are in fact geographic, but specific to the institution or entity and not part of the surrounding numbering sequence (and thus quite different from the neighbouring properties) - for example, EH99 1SP can be used with GPS mapping to locate and navigate to the Scottish Parliament (which is directly opposite the Palace of Holyrood House, EH8 8DX, and across the road from 7/4 Canongate, EH8 8BX).

Postcode ending nHQ: The letters HQ for the last two letters may also mean it is most likely a non-geographic postcode or that Royal Mail holds the mail where a redirection, bulk mail delivery or open and scan to email service is available.

Girobank&#x27;s headquarters in Bootle used the non-geographic postcode GIR 0AA.

There is also a special postcode for letters to Santa/Father Christmas, XM4 5HQ.

Publication: Many non-geographic postcodes do not appear on Royal Mail&#x27;s own online postcode finder tool or their Click and Drop online postage printing tool, which can add to confusion when responding to organisations that use such addresses. Likewise, delivery services or couriers other than Royal Mail may not be able to deliver to such non-physical addresses. The UK government provides for couriers alternative geographic addresses to their BX addresses.

Extent: Non-geographic postcode districts have been allocated in 63 of the 121 postcode areas (and also in two of three three postcode areas of the Crown Dependencies). 
===Special postcodes===
Postcodes are allocated by Royal Mail&#x27;s Address Management Unit and cannot be purchased or specified by the recipient. However, Royal Mail sometimes assigns semi-mnemonic postcodes (sometimes based on the actual geographic postcode district) to high-profile organisations.

Prominent examples are:
The postcode printed on Business Reply envelopes (which do not require a stamp) often ends with the letters BR.

Post codes ending 1AA are usually allocated to post offices (Crown, main and sub-) such as NR3 1AA for Magdalen Street post office in Norwich. Some are defunct following disposal of former Post Office buildings (e.g. EH1 1AA in Edinburgh).

==Operation==
===Sorting===
Postcodes are used to sort letters to their destination either manually, where sorters use labelled frames, or increasingly with letter-coding systems, where machines assist in sorting. A variation of automated sorting uses optical character recognition (OCR) to read printed postcodes, best suited to mail that uses a standard layout and addressing format.

A long string of &quot;faced&quot; letters (i.e. turned to allow the address to be read) is presented to a keyboard operator at a coding desk, who types the postcodes onto the envelopes in coloured phosphor dots. The associated machine uses the outward codes in these dots to direct bundles of letters into the correct bags for specific delivery offices. With a machine knowledge of the specific addresses handled by each postal walk at each office, the bundles can be further sorted using the dots of the inward sorting code so that each delivery round receives only its own letters. This feature depends upon whether it is cost effective to second-sort outward letters, and tends to be used only at main sorting offices where high volumes are handled.

When postcodes are incomplete or missing, the operator reads the post town name and inserts a code sufficient for outward sorting to the post town, where others can further direct it. The mail bags of letter bundles are sent by road, air or train, and eventually by road to the delivery office. At the delivery office the mail that is handled manually is inward sorted to the postal walk that will deliver it; it is then &quot;set in&quot;, i.e. sorted into the walk order that allows the deliverer the most convenient progress in the round. The latter process is now being automated, as the roll-out of walk sequencing machines continues.

====Integrated Mail Processors====
Integrated Mail Processors (IMPs) read the postcode on the item and translate it into two phosphorus barcodes representing the inward and outward parts of the postcode, which the machines subsequently print and read to sort the mail to the correct outward postcode. Letters may also be sequentially sorted by a Compact Sequence Sorter (CSS) reading the outward postcode in the order that a walking postman/woman will deliver, door to door. On such items the top phosphorous barcode is the inward part of the code, the bottom is the outward.

IMPs can also read RM4SCC items, as used in Cleanmail, a different format to the above.

====Mailsort and Walksort====
A newer system of five-digit codes called Mailsort was designed for users who send &quot;a minimum of 4,000 letter-sized items&quot;. It encodes the outward part of the postcode in a way that is useful for mail routing, so that a particular range of Mailsort codes goes on a particular plane or lorry. Mailsort users are supplied with a database to allow them to convert from postcodes to Mailsort codes and receive a discount if they deliver mail to the post office split up by Mailsort code. Users providing outgoing mail sorted by postcode receive no such incentive since postcode areas and districts are assigned using permanent mnemonics and do not therefore assist with grouping items together into operationally significant blocks. Walksort was discontinued in May 2012.

==Listings and availability==

There are approximately 1.7 million postcodes in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.

Each postcode is divided by a space into two parts. As mentioned above, the first part starts with the postcode area and ends with the postcode district. The second part begins with a single digit, which indicates the postcode sector, and ends with the postcode unit.

Postcode areas are also divided into several post towns, which predate the introduction of postcodes, with the London post town uniquely covering more than one postcode area.

As of June 2016, there are 124 postcode areas, 2,987 postcode districts, 11,192 postcode sectors, and 1,500 post towns. , 55,540 full postcodes in England and Wales contain only one household. Addresses receiving large volumes of mail are each assigned separate &quot;large user&quot; postcodes. But most postcodes are shared by several neighbouring properties, typically covering about 15 addresses.

===Life-cycle of postcodes===
There are also significant numbers of discontinued (terminated) codes. Each month some 2,750 postcodes are created and 2,500 terminated.

===Postcode Address File (PAF)===
The Address Management Unit of Royal Mail maintains an official database of UK postal addresses and postcodes in its Postcode Address File (PAF), which is made available under licence for a fee regulated by Ofcom. The PAF is commercially licensable and is often incorporated in address management software packages. The capabilities of such packages allow most addresses to be constructed solely from the postcode and house number. By including the map references of postcodes in the address database, the postcode can be used to pinpoint a postcode area on a map. PAF is updated daily.

On its website, Royal Mail publishes summary information about major changes to postcode sectors and postal localities (including post towns). Individual postcodes or postal addresses can be found using Royal Mail&#x27;s Postcode and Address Finder website, but this is limited to 50 free searches per user per day.

===Code-Point Open===
A complete list of all current Great Britain postcodes, known as Code-Point Open, has been made available online (since 1 April 2010) by Ordnance Survey. Under the government&#x27;s OS OpenData initiative, it is available for re-use without charge under an attribution-only licence. The Code-Point Open list includes median coordinates for each postcode but excludes postcodes in Northern Ireland and the Crown dependencies. Unlike the PAF products provided by Royal Mail, the Code-Point Open list does not include postal address text.

===ONS Postcode Directory and National Statistics Postcode Lookup===
The Office for National Statistics also produces postcode directories, under similar licence terms to the OS product. Both the ONSPD and NSPL contain Northern Ireland postcodes, with centroid coordinates in the OSI grid as opposed to the OSGB grid, although Northern Ireland postcodes are subject to a more restrictive licence permitting internal business use only. Postcodes for the Crown Dependencies are also included, without co-ordinates. A further difference is that non-current postcodes and dates of introduction and withdrawal of postcodes are included.

==Other uses==

While postcodes were introduced to expedite the delivery of mail, they are useful tools for other purposes, particularly because codes are very fine-grained and identify just a few addresses. Among these uses are:
* With satellite navigation systems, to navigate to an address by street number and postcode
* By life insurance companies and pension funds to assess longevity for pricing and reserving
* By other types of insurance companies to assess premiums for motoring/business/domestic policies
* To determine catchment areas for school places or doctors&#x27; surgeries
*Finding the nearest branch of an organisation to a given address. A computer program uses the postcodes of the target address and the branches to list the closest branches in order of distance as the crow flies (or, if used in conjunction with street-map software, by road distance). This can be used by companies to inform potential customers where to go, by job centres to find jobs for job-seekers, to alert people of town planning applications in their area, and a great many other applications.

The phrase &quot;postcode lottery&quot; refers to the variation in the availability of services by region, though not always because of postcodes.

For these and related reasons, postcodes in some areas have become indicators of social status. Some residents have campaigned to change their postcode to associate themselves with a more desirable area, to disassociate with a poorer area, to reduce insurance premiums or to be associated with an area with a lower cost of living. In all these cases Royal Mail has said that there is &quot;virtually no hope&quot; of changing the postcode, referring to their policy of changing postcodes only to match changes in their operations.

Postcode areas rarely align with local government boundaries. The phenomenon whereby postcodes overlap administrative boundaries is known as &#x27;straddling&#x27;. Some postcodes straddle England&#x27;s borders with Wales and Scotland, such as CH and TD. This has led to British Sky Broadcasting subscribers receiving the wrong BBC and ITV regions, and newly licensed radio amateurs being given incorrect call signs.

<text>Millport () is the only town on the island of Great Cumbrae in the Firth of Clyde off the coast of mainland Scotland, in the council area of North Ayrshire. The town is south of the ferry terminal that links the island to the Scottish mainland.

Due to its small size, the island and its town are often linked in the minds of visitors and residents and Cumbrae is often referred to as Millport. The island offers views across to the Isle of Arran as well as of its smaller neighbour which lies barely a kilometre away, called Little Cumbrae. The Cumbraes are referred to as the &quot;Kumreyiar&quot; in the medieval Norse &quot;Saga of Haakon Haakonarson&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The Gaelic name &quot;Cumaradh&quot; means &quot;place of the Cymric people&quot;, referring to the Brittonic-speaking inhabitants of the Kingdom of Strathclyde. Alternatively, the name Cumbrae may derive from &quot;Kil Maura&quot; meaning &quot;cell or church of a female saint&quot;.

== History ==
During the development of the River Clyde as a main thoroughfare for goods, shipbuilding and smuggling, Millport was a strategic base for Customs and Excise. Several of the streets in Millport are named after crew members of the Revenue cutter &quot;Royal George&quot;. The Victorian era was a period of rapid growth, both in terms of population, governance, amenities and property. To the west and east of the old harbour, many fine Victorian and Edwardian villas were built, along with new tenements. Many of these used rock mined from The Eileans. These large houses still form the backbone of the housing stock.

The Cathedral of the Isles of the Scottish Episcopal Church, completed in 1851, seats only 100 people. It is the smallest cathedral in Great Britain and is variously described as &quot;the smallest cathedral in Europe&quot;, &quot;the second smallest in Europe&quot;, or &quot;probably the smallest in Europe&quot;. Various other churches such as the cathedrals in Nin and Zadar in Croatia lay claim to this title.

The local Lady Margaret Hospital was founded in 1900 and bears the name of Lady Margaret Crichton-Stuart, daughter of John Patrick Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute as a tribute and mark of respect to the eldest daughter of Lord Bute.

== Population and demographics ==

The usual island population of 1,376 as recorded by the 2011 census was a slight fall from the 2001 figure of 1,434. The population increases substantially during the summer tourist season.

The island has an active and engaged community with a wide range of interest groups represented in the many clubs and associations on the island. The island has its own radio online station, Radio Millport. The Guardian reported that Cumbrae was number 8 in British online property searches in 2021, attributing this to the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown then in force.

As well as its numerous beaches, Millport has an 18-hole golf course with views over the Arran hills and the Firth of Clyde. Other recreational facilities include a crazy golf course, Millport Bowling Club with a putting green, and two football pitches. In addition to coastal sea fishing, primarily for mackerel, fly fishing is available at two fresh water reservoirs. 

The perimeter road around the island is used by walkers and cyclists and provides access to the island&#x27;s beaches.

The community is represented by The Cumbrae Community Council. Council members are elected by the residents, and all groups and individuals on the island are invited to its monthly meetings. The community council provides a connection with North Ayrshire council, and its members are formal members of Locality Planning Partnerships. Millport is part of North Ayrshire, and is represented on North Ayrshire Council as part of the North Coast council ward which is based at Cunningham House in Irvine, the administrative centre of North Ayrshire Council.

== Developments ==
The Garrison House in the centre of town, constructed in 1745, was formerly the barracks/Captain&#x27;s mansion, then the home of the Earl of Glasgow, and is now in community ownership (see &quot;Current Developments&quot; below).

The Garrison House was badly damaged after an arson attack in 2001. Cumbrae Community Development Company, the local development trust, made a successful bid to the National Lottery and other funders to enable the building to be re-constructed for community benefit. After several years of work renovation of the property was completed in 2008 at a total cost of £5 million. It now houses the Museum of the Cumbraes, a library, council offices, a GP surgery and the Garrison Café.

, developments on the island include:
* A flood protection scheme is being developed for the south of the island.
* A marina is proposed as part of the flood protection scheme works.
* Millport Town Hall is being brought back into use.
* A proposal is underway to buy the former National Watersports Centre and make it into a community facility called The Wave.
* A large development of around 40 family sized homes is underway between Millport Bowling Club and Penmachrie Farm.
* In 2011, Millport considered applying for city status, on the basis of having a cathedral. It would have been the smallest city in the UK.

== Economy and education ==

Millport has a hotel and guest house, and many properties are available as holiday lets. A motorhome site caters for short term stays.

The wide sandy beaches close to the centre of the town are popular for paddling and swimming.
One of the best known landmarks in Millport is the Crocodile Rock, a rock on the foreshore that has been painted to look like a crocodile. It has been a feature since at least 1913 when Robert Brown was acknowledged by the council for the work.

Millport has the world&#x27;s narrowest house, The Wedge, which measures at its front. The house is 22 feet long by 11 feet wide at its widest point ().

Millport Bay is a popular destination for sailors in the summer, and has a number of donation-based visitor moorings. There is a small boatyard at the western end of the town. The town hosts Scotland&#x27;s biggest independent country music festival, the Millport Country Music Festival, in September each year, and a fireworks display is held during September. The historic paddle steamer calls at Millport twice a week during the summer, on trips originating at Ayr and Glasgow.

Primary-aged children on the island attend Cumbrae Primary School. Older children attend Largs Academy on the mainland. FSC Millport is a biological teaching and research centre operated by the Field Studies Council. The centre&#x27;s origins can be traced back to 1885, when the oceanographer Sir John Murray set up a floating laboratory in a lighter which he called &#x27;The Ark&#x27;. This led to the establishment of the Millport Marine Biological Station in 1897 by the naturalist David Robertson, also known as the &#x27;Cumbrae Naturalist&#x27;.

In 1970 the station became the University Marine Biological Station Millport of the University of London. In 2014 ownership transferred to the Field Studies Council, which built new classrooms and accommodation for school and university visitors as well as providing holiday accommodation. The National Watersports Training Centre was a Sportscotland facility that taught a wide range of courses including sailing, windsurfing, paddlesports, cruising and yachting. The centre closed in 2020, and a local group is planning to reopen the site for community use..

The island also has it&#x27;s own Coastguard Rescue Team whose station is on the South East of the island, adjacent to the FSC Millport and which forms part of His Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard, one of around 350 such teams based around the coast of the UK..

== Transport ==
In spite of its relatively remote feel, Millport is only one hour&#x27;s travel from major transport hubs of Glasgow Airport and Glasgow Central railway station. Millport is accessible by public transport via the train at , with a ferry journey of eight minutes. A bus to Millport meets each ferry.

== In popular culture ==
The town of Millport was the titular setting for the BBC Radio 4 comedy &quot;Millport&quot;; written by Lynn Ferguson. The series was broadcast between 2000 and 2002, and recounts the lives of several Millport inhabitants including Irene Bruce (played by Ferguson) and her sister Moira, with the former desperate to leave the isolate community and start her life anew in the mainland. The radio series resulted in a television adaptation in 2002 that did not progress beyond the pilot, the latter being not well received by the islanders

<doc id="99656" wikidata="Q1570382" url="?curid=99656" title="Creative destruction">
<text>Creative destruction (German: &quot;schöpferische Zerstörung&quot;) is a concept in economics that describes a process in which new innovations replace and make obsolete older innovations.

The concept is usually identified with the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, who derived it from the work of Karl Marx and popularized it as a theory of economic innovation and the business cycle. It is also sometimes known as Schumpeter&#x27;s gale. In Marxian economic theory, the concept refers more broadly to the linked processes of the accumulation and annihilation of wealth under capitalism.

The German sociologist Werner Sombart has been credited with the first use of these terms in his work &quot;Krieg und Kapitalismus&quot; (&quot;War and Capitalism&quot;, 1913). In the earlier work of Marx, however, the idea of creative destruction or annihilation (German: &quot;Vernichtung&quot;) implies not only that capitalism destroys and reconfigures previous economic orders, but also that it must continuously devalue existing wealth (whether through war, dereliction, or regular and periodic economic crises) in order to clear the ground for the creation of new wealth.

In &quot;Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy&quot; (1942), Joseph Schumpeter developed the concept out of a careful reading of Marx&#x27;s thought. In contrast with Marx - who argued that the creative-destructive forces unleashed by capitalism would eventually lead to its demise as a system - Schumpeter reinforced the evolutionary nature of capitalist economies, downplaying the concerns of static competition analysis (i.e., market concentration), and reinforcing the importance of dynamic competition analysis (i.e., threat of entry, new technologies and means of production, competition in dimensions different than price). In his words, &quot;This process of Creative
Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism. It is what capitalism consists in and what every capitalist concern has got to live in [...] The problem that is usually being visualized is how capitalism administers existing structures, whereas the relevant problem is how it creates and destroys them. As long as this is not recognized, the investigator does a meaningless job. As soon as it is recognized, his outlook on capitalist practice and its social results changes considerably.&quot; Despite this, the term subsequently gained popularity within mainstream economics as a description of processes such as downsizing to increase the efficiency and dynamism of a company. The Marxian usage has, however, been retained and further developed in the work of social scientists such as David Harvey, Marshall Berman, Manuel Castells and Daniele Archibugi.

In modern economics, creative destruction is one of the central concepts in the endogenous growth theory. 
In Why Nations Fail, a popular book on long-term economic development, Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson argue the major reason countries stagnate and go into decline is the willingness of the ruling elites to block creative destruction, a beneficial process that promotes innovation.

==History==

=== In Marx&#x27;s thought ===
Although the modern term &quot;creative destruction&quot; is not used explicitly by Marx, it is largely derived from his analyses, particularly in the work of Werner Sombart (whom Engels described as the only German professor who understood Marx&#x27;s &quot;Capital&quot;), and of Joseph Schumpeter, who discussed at length the origin of the idea in Marx&#x27;s work (see below).

In &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; of 1848, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels described the crisis tendencies of capitalism in terms of &quot;the enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces&quot;:
Modern bourgeois society, with its relations of production, of exchange and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells. ... It is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the whole of bourgeois society on trial, each time more threateningly. In these crises, &quot;a great part not only of existing production, but also of previously created productive forces, are periodically destroyed&quot;. In these crises, there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would have seemed an absurdity – the epidemic of over-production. Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of devastation, had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence; industry and commerce seem to be destroyed; and why? Because there is too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce. The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions. ... And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises? On the one hand by &quot;enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces&quot;; on the other, by the conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones. That is to say, by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented.
A few years later, in the &quot;Grundrisse&quot;, Marx was writing of &quot;the violent destruction of capital not by relations external to it, but rather as a condition of its self-preservation&quot;. In other words, he establishes a necessary link between the generative or creative forces of production in capitalism and the destruction of capital value as one of the key ways in which capitalism attempts to overcome its internal contradictions:
These contradictions lead to explosions, cataclysms, crises, in which ... momentaneous suspension of labour and annihilation of a great portion of capital ... violently lead it back to the point where it is enabled [to go on] fully employing its productive powers without committing suicide.
In the &quot;Theories of Surplus Value&quot; (&quot;Volume IV&quot; of &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, 1863), Marx refines this theory to distinguish between scenarios where the destruction of (commodity) values affects either use values or exchange values or both together. The destruction of exchange value combined with the preservation of use value presents clear opportunities for new capital investment and hence for the repetition of the production-devaluation cycle:
the destruction of capital through crises means the depreciation of values which prevents them from later renewing their reproduction process as capital on the same scale. This is the ruinous effect of the fall in the prices of commodities. It does not cause the destruction of any use-values. What one loses, the other gains. Values used as capital are prevented from acting again as capital in the hands of the same person. The old capitalists go bankrupt. ... A large part of the nominal capital of the society, i.e., of the exchange-value of the existing capital, is once for all destroyed, although this very destruction, since it does not affect the use-value, may very much expedite the new reproduction. This is also the period during which moneyed interest enriches itself at the cost of industrial interest.
Social geographer David Harvey sums up the differences between Marx&#x27;s usage of these concepts and Schumpeter&#x27;s: &quot;Both Karl Marx and Joseph Schumpeter wrote at length on the &#x27;creative-destructive&#x27; tendencies inherent in capitalism. While Marx clearly admired capitalism&#x27;s creativity he ... strongly emphasised its self-destructiveness. The Schumpeterians have all along gloried in capitalism&#x27;s endless creativity while treating the destructiveness as mostly a matter of the normal costs of doing business&quot;.

=== Other early usage ===

In the &quot;Origin of Species&quot;, which was published in 1859, Charles Darwin wrote that the &quot;extinction of old forms is the almost inevitable consequence of the production of new forms.&quot; One notable exception to this rule is how the extinction of the dinosaurs facilitated the adaptive radiation of mammals. In this case creation was the consequence, rather than the cause, of destruction.

In philosophical terms, the concept of &quot;creative destruction&quot; is close to Hegel&#x27;s concept of sublation. In German economic discourse it was taken up from Marx&#x27;s writings by Werner Sombart, particularly in his 1913 text &quot;Krieg und Kapitalismus&quot;:
Again, however, &quot;from destruction a new spirit of creation arises;&quot; the scarcity of wood and the needs of everyday life... forced the discovery or invention of substitutes for wood, forced the use of coal for heating, forced the invention of coke for the production of iron.
Hugo Reinert has argued that Sombart&#x27;s formulation of the concept was influenced by Eastern mysticism, specifically the image of the Hindu god Shiva, who is presented in the paradoxical aspect of simultaneous destroyer and creator. Conceivably this influence passed from Johann Gottfried Herder, who brought Hindu thought to German philosophy in his &quot;Philosophy of Human History&quot; (Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit) (Herder 1790–92), specifically volume III, pp. 41–64. via Arthur Schopenhauer and the Orientalist Friedrich Maier through Friedrich Nietzsche´s writings. Nietzsche represented the creative destruction of modernity through the mythical figure of Dionysus, a figure whom he saw as at one and the same time &quot;destructively creative&quot; and &quot;creatively destructive&quot;. In the following passage from &quot;On the Genealogy of Morality&quot; (1887), Nietzsche argues for a universal principle of a cycle of creation and destruction, such that every creative act has its destructive consequence:
But have you ever asked yourselves sufficiently how much the erection of every ideal on earth has cost? How much reality has had to be misunderstood and slandered, how many lies have had to be sanctified, how many consciences disturbed, how much &quot;God&quot; sacrificed every time? If a temple is to be erected a temple must be destroyed: that is the law – let anyone who can show me a case in which it is not fulfilled! – Friedrich Nietzsche, &quot;On the Genealogy of Morality&quot;

Other nineteenth-century formulations of this idea include Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin, who wrote in 1842, &quot;The passion for destruction is a creative passion, too!&quot; Note, however, that this earlier formulation might more accurately be termed &quot;destructive creation&quot;, and differs sharply from Marx&#x27;s and Schumpeter&#x27;s formulations in its focus on the active destruction of the existing social and political order by human agents (as opposed to systemic forces or contradictions in the case of both Marx and Schumpeter).

==Association with Joseph Schumpeter==
The expression &quot;creative destruction&quot; was popularized by and is most associated with Joseph Schumpeter, particularly in his book &quot;Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy&quot;, first published in 1942. Already in his 1939 book &quot;Business Cycles&quot;, he attempted to refine the innovative ideas of Nikolai Kondratieff and his long-wave cycle which Schumpeter believed was driven by technological innovation. Three years later, in &quot;Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy&quot;, Schumpeter introduced the term &quot;creative destruction&quot;, which he explicitly derived from Marxist thought (analysed extensively in Part I of the book) and used it to describe the disruptive process of transformation that accompanies such innovation:
Capitalism ... is by nature a form or method of economic change and not only never is but never can be stationary. ... The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers&#x27; goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates... The opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic, and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory to such concerns as U.S. Steel illustrate the process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure &quot;from within&quot;, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. This process of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism. It is what capitalism consists in and what every capitalist concern has got to live in.[... Capitalism requires] the perennial gale of Creative Destruction.
In Schumpeter&#x27;s vision of capitalism, innovative entry by entrepreneurs was the disruptive force that sustained economic growth, even as it destroyed the value of established companies and laborers that enjoyed some degree of monopoly power derived from previous technological, organizational, regulatory, and economic paradigms. However, Schumpeter was pessimistic about the sustainability of this process, seeing it as leading eventually to the undermining of capitalism&#x27;s own institutional frameworks:
In breaking down the pre-capitalist framework of society, capitalism thus broke not only barriers that impeded its progress but also flying buttresses that prevented its collapse. That process, impressive in its relentless necessity, was not merely a matter of removing institutional deadwood, but of removing partners of the capitalist stratum, symbiosis with whom was an essential element of the capitalist schema. [... T]he capitalist process in much the same way in which it destroyed the institutional framework of feudal society also undermines its own.

=== Examples ===
 Schumpeter (1949) in one of his examples used &quot;the railroadization of the Middle West as it was initiated by the Illinois Central.&quot; He wrote, &quot;The Illinois Central not only meant very good business whilst it was built and whilst new cities were built around it and land was cultivated, but it spelled the death sentence for the [old] agriculture of the West.&quot;

Companies that once revolutionized and dominated new industries – for example, Xerox in copiers or Polaroid in instant photography – have seen their profits fall and their dominance vanish as rivals launched improved designs or cut manufacturing costs. In technology, the cassette tape replaced the 8-track, only to be replaced in turn by the compact disc, which was undercut by downloads to MP3 players, which is now being usurped by web-based streaming services. Companies that made money out of technology which eventually becomes obsolete do not necessarily adapt well to the business environment created by the new technologies.

One such example is how online ad-supported news sites such as &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; are leading to creative destruction of the traditional newspaper. &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; announced in January 2009 that it would no longer continue to publish a daily paper edition, but would be available online daily and provide a weekly print edition. The &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; became online-only in March 2009. At a national level in USA, employment in the newspaper business fell from 455,700 in 1990 to 225,100 in 2013. Over that same period, employment in internet publishing and broadcasting grew from 29,400 to 121,200. Traditional French alumni networks, which typically charge their students to network online or through paper directories, are in danger of creative destruction from free social networking sites such as LinkedIn and Viadeo.

In fact, successful innovation is normally a source of temporary market power, eroding the profits and position of old firms, yet ultimately succumbing to the pressure of new inventions commercialised by competing entrants. Creative destruction is a powerful economic concept because it can explain many of the dynamics or kinetics of industrial change: the transition from a competitive to a monopolistic market, and back again. It has been the inspiration of endogenous growth theory and also of evolutionary economics.

David Ames Wells (1890), who was a leading authority on the effects of technology on the economy in the late 19th century, gave many examples of creative destruction (without using the term) brought about by improvements in steam engine efficiency, shipping, the international telegraph network, and agricultural mechanization.

==Later developments==

===Ludwig Lachmann===

=== David Harvey ===
Geographer and historian David Harvey in a series of works from the 1970s onwards (&quot;Social Justice and the City&quot;, 1973; &quot;The Limits to Capital&quot;, 1982; &quot;The Urbanization of Capital&quot;, 1985; &quot;Spaces of Hope&quot;, 2000; &quot;Spaces of Capital&quot;, 2001; &quot;Spaces of Neoliberalization&quot;, 2005; &quot;The Enigma of Capital and the Crises of Capitalism&quot;, 2010), elaborated Marx&#x27;s thought on the systemic contradictions of capitalism, particularly in relation to the production of the urban environment (and to the production of space more broadly). He developed the notion that capitalism finds a &quot;spatial fix&quot; for its periodic crises of overaccumulation through investment in fixed assets of infrastructure, buildings, etc.: &quot;The built environment that constitutes a vast field of collective means of production and consumption absorbs huge amounts of capital in both its construction and its maintenance. Urbanization is one way to absorb the capital surplus&quot;. While the creation of the built environment can act as a form of crisis displacement, it can also constitute a limit in its own right, as it tends to freeze productive forces into a fixed spatial form. As capital cannot abide a limit to profitability, ever more frantic forms of &quot;time-space compression&quot; (increased speed of turnover, innovation of ever faster transport and communications&#x27; infrastructure, &quot;flexible accumulation&quot;) ensue, often impelling technological innovation. Such innovation, however, is a double-edged sword:

Globalization can be viewed as some ultimate form of time-space compression, allowing capital investment to move almost instantaneously from one corner of the globe to another, devaluing fixed assets and laying off labour in one urban conglomeration while opening up new centres of manufacture in more profitable sites for production operations. Hence, in this continual process of creative destruction, capitalism does not resolve its contradictions and crises, but merely &quot;moves them around geographically&quot;.

=== Marshall Berman ===
In his 1987 book &quot;All That is Solid Melts into Air: The Experience of Modernity&quot;, particularly in the chapter entitled &quot;Innovative Self-Destruction&quot; (pp. 98–104), Marshall Berman provides a reading of Marxist &quot;creative destruction&quot; to explain key processes at work within modernity. The title of the book is taken from a well-known passage from &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;. Berman elaborates this into something of a &quot;Zeitgeist&quot; which has profound social and cultural consequences:

Here Berman emphasizes Marx&#x27;s perception of the fragility and evanescence of capitalism&#x27;s immense creative forces, and makes this apparent contradiction into one of the key explanatory figures of modernity.

In 2021, Berman&#x27;s younger son applied the elder&#x27;s conception of creative destruction to the field of art history, writing in Hunter College&#x27;s graduate art history journal. The essay reconsiders the modern media of photography, photomontage, and collage through the lens of &quot;creative destruction&quot;. In doing so, the younger Berman attempts to show that in certain works of art of the above-mentioned media, referents (such as nature, real people, other works of art, newspaper clippings, etc.) can be given new and unique significance even while necessarily being obscured by the very nature of their presentation.

=== Manuel Castells ===
The sociologist Manuel Castells, in his trilogy on &quot;The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture&quot; (the first volume of which, &quot;The Rise of the Network Society&quot;, appeared in 1996), reinterpreted the processes by which capitalism invests in certain regions of the globe, while divesting from others, using the new paradigm of &quot;informational networks&quot;. In the era of globalization, capitalism is characterized by near-instantaneous flow, creating a new spatial dimension, &quot;the space of flows&quot;. While technological innovation has enabled this unprecedented fluidity, this very process makes redundant whole areas and populations who are bypassed by informational networks. Indeed, the new spatial form of the mega-city or megalopolis, is defined by Castells as having the contradictory quality of being &quot;globally connected and locally disconnected, physically and socially&quot;. Castells explicitly links these arguments to the notion of creative destruction:

===Daniele Archibugi===
Developing the Schumpeterian legacy, the school of the Science Policy Research Unit of the University of Sussex further detailed the importance of creative destruction. In particular, new technologies are often incompatible with the existing productive regimes and will bankrupt companies and even industries that change too slowly. Chris Freeman and Carlota Perez developed these insights. More recently, Daniele Archibugi and Andrea Filippetti associated the 2008 economic crisis with the slow-down of opportunities offered by information and communication technologies (ICTs). Archibugi used the 1982 film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; as a metaphor to argue that of the innovations shown, all those associated with ICTs have become part of everyday life. However, none in the field of biotechnology have been fully commercialized. A new economic recovery will occur when some key technological opportunities are identified and sustained.

=== Others ===
In 1992, the idea of creative destruction was put into formal mathematical terms by Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt, giving an alternative model of endogenous growth compared to Paul Romer&#x27;s expanding varieties model.

In 1995, Harvard Business School authors Richard L. Nolan and David C. Croson released a book advocating downsizing to free up slack resources, which could then be reinvested to create competitive advantage.

More recently, the idea of &quot;creative destruction&quot; was utilized by Max Page in his 1999 book, &quot;The Creative Destruction of Manhattan, 1900–1940.&quot; The book traces Manhattan&#x27;s constant reinvention, often at the expense of preserving a concrete past. Describing this process as &quot;creative destruction,&quot; Page describes the complex historical circumstances, economics, social conditions and personalities that have produced crucial changes in Manhattan&#x27;s cityscape.

In addition to Max Page, others have used the term &quot;creative destruction&quot; to describe the process of urban renewal and modernization. T.C. Chang and Shirlena Huang referenced &quot;creative destruction&quot; in their paper &quot;Recreating place, replacing memory: Creative Destruction at the Singapore River.&quot; The authors explored the efforts to redevelop a waterfront area that reflected a vibrant new culture while paying sufficient homage to the history of the region. Rosemary Wakeman chronicled the evolution of an area in central Paris, France known as Les Halles. Les Halles housed a vibrant marketplace starting in the twelfth century. Ultimately, in 1971, the markets were relocated and the pavilions torn down. In their place, now stand a hub for trains, subways and buses. Les Halles is also the site of the largest shopping mall in France and the controversial Centre Georges Pompidou.

The term &quot;creative destruction&quot; has been applied to the arts. Alan Ackerman and Martin Puncher (2006) edited a collection of essays under the title &quot;Against Theater: Creative destruction on the modernist stage.&quot; They detail the changes and the causal motivations experienced in theater as a result of the modernization of both the production of performances and the underlying economics. They speak of how theater has reinvented itself in the face of anti-theatricality, straining the boundaries of the traditional to include more physical productions, which might be considered avant-garde staging techniques.

Additionally within art, Tyler Cowen&#x27;s book &quot;Creative Destruction&quot; describes how art styles change as artists are simply exposed to outside ideas and styles, even if they do not intend to incorporate those influences into their art. Traditional styles may give way to new styles, and thus creative destruction allows for more diversified art, especially when cultures share their art with each other.

In his 1999 book, &quot;Still the New World, American Literature in a Culture of Creative Destruction&quot;, Philip Fisher analyzes the themes of creative destruction at play in literary works of the twentieth century, including the works of such authors as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Herman Melville, Mark Twain, and Henry James, among others. Fisher argues that creative destruction exists within literary forms just as it does within the changing of technology.

Neoconservative author Michael Ledeen argued in his 2002 book &quot;The War Against the Terror Masters&quot; that America is a revolutionary nation, undoing traditional societies: &quot;Creative destruction is our middle name, both within our own society and abroad. We tear down the old order every day, from business to science, literature, art, architecture, and cinema to politics and the law.&quot; His characterization of creative destruction as a model for social development has met with fierce opposition from paleoconservatives.

Creative destruction has also been linked to sustainable development. The connection was explicitly mentioned for the first time by Stuart L. Hart and Mark B. Milstein in their 1999 article &quot;Global Sustainability and the Creative Destruction of Industries&quot;, in which he argues new profit opportunities lie in a round of creative destruction driven by global sustainability. (They would strengthen this argument later in their 2003 article &quot;Creating Sustainable Value&quot; and, in 2005, with &quot;Innovation, Creative Destruction and Sustainability&quot;.) Andrea L. Larson agreed with this vision a year later in &quot;Sustainable Innovation Through an Entrepreneurship Lens&quot;, stating entrepreneurs should be open to the opportunities for disruptive improvement based on sustainability. In 2005, James Hartshorn (et al.) emphasized the opportunities for sustainable, disruptive improvement in the construction industry in his article &quot;Creative Destruction: Building Toward Sustainability&quot;.

Some economists argue that the destructive component of creative destruction has become more powerful than it was in the past. They claim that the creative component does not add as much to growth as in earlier generations, and innovation has become more rent-seeking than value-creating.

==Alternative name==
The following text appears to be the source of the phrase &quot;Schumpeter&#x27;s Gale&quot; to refer to creative destruction:

==Impediments==
Politicians often impose impediments to the forces of creative destruction by regulating entry and exit rules that make it difficult for churning to take place. In a series of papers Andrei Shleifer and Simeon Djankov illustrate the effects of such regulation on slowing down competition and innovation.

==In popular culture==
The film &quot;Other People&#x27;s Money&quot; (1991) provides contrasting views of creative destruction, presented in two speeches regarding the takeover of a publicly traded wire and cable company in a small New England town. One speech is by a corporate raider, and the other is given by the company CEO, who is principally interested in protecting his employees and the town.

<text>Ipswich () is a port town and borough in Suffolk, England. It is the county town, and largest in Suffolk, followed by Lowestoft and Bury St Edmunds, and the third-largest population centre in East Anglia, after Peterborough and Norwich. It is northeast of London and in 2011 had a population of 144,957. The Ipswich built-up area is the fourth-largest in the East of England and the 42nd-largest in England and Wales. It includes the towns and villages of Kesgrave, Woodbridge, Bramford and Martlesham Heath.

Ipswich was first recorded during the medieval period as &quot;Gippeswic&quot;, the town has also been recorded as &quot;Gyppewicus&quot; and &quot;Yppswyche&quot;. It has been continuously inhabited since the Saxon period, and is believed to be one of the oldest towns in the United Kingdom. The settlement was of great economic importance to the Kingdom of England throughout its history, particularly in trade, with the town&#x27;s historical dock, Ipswich Waterfront, known as the largest and most important dock in the Kingdom.

Ipswich is divided into various quarters, with the town centre and the waterfront drawing the most footfall. The town centre features the retail shopping district and the historic town square, known as the Cornhill. The waterfront, south of the town centre on a meander of the River Orwell, offers a picturesque setting with a marina, luxury yachts, high-rise apartment buildings, and a variety of restaurants and cafes. The waterfront is also home to the University of Suffolk campus.

Ipswich is adjacent to the Suffolk &amp; Essex Coast &amp; Heaths National Landscape AONB and is close to Dedham Vale AONB. The town has a tourist sector, with 3.5 million people reported to have visited the town in 2016. In 2020, Ipswich was ranked as an emerging global tourist destination by TripAdvisor.

==History==
Ipswich is one of England&#x27;s oldest towns, and is claimed to be the oldest still continuing town to have been established and developed by the English, with continuous settlement since early Anglo-Saxon times.

===Roman settlement===
A large Roman fort, part of the coastal defences of Britain, stood at Walton near Felixstowe (, and the largest Roman villa in Suffolk (possibly an administrative complex) stood at Castle Hill (north-west Ipswich).

===Middle Ages===
The modern town took shape in Anglo-Saxon times (7th–8th centuries) around the Port of Ipswich. As the coastal states of north-western Europe emerged from the collapse of the Roman Empire, essential North Sea trade and communication between eastern Britain and the continent (especially to Scandinavia, and through the Rhine) passed through the former Roman ports of London (serving the kingdoms of Mercia, the East Saxons, Kent) and York (Eoforwic) (serving the Kingdom of Northumbria).

&quot;Gipeswic&quot; (also in other spellings such as &quot;Gippeswich&quot;) arose as the equivalent to these, serving the Kingdom of East Anglia, its early imported wares dating to the time of King Rædwald, ruler of the East Angles (616–624). The famous ship-burial and treasure at Sutton Hoo nearby () is probably his grave. The Ipswich Museum houses replicas of the Roman Mildenhall and Sutton Hoo treasures. A gallery devoted to the town&#x27;s origins includes Anglo-Saxon weapons, jewellery and other artefacts.

The seventh-century town was centred near the quay. Around 700 AD, Frisian potters from the Netherlands area settled in Ipswich and set up the first large-scale potteries in England since Roman times. Their wares were traded far across England, and the industry was unique to Ipswich for 200 years. With growing prosperity, in about 720 AD a large new part of the town was laid out in the Buttermarket area. Ipswich was becoming a place of national and international importance. Parts of the ancient road plan still survive in its modern streets.

After the invasion of 869, Ipswich fell under Viking rule. The earth ramparts circling the town centre were probably raised by Vikings in Ipswich around 900 to prevent its recapture by the English. They were unsuccessful. The town operated a mint under royal licence from King Edgar in the 970s, which continued through the Norman Conquest until the time of King John, in about 1215. The abbreviation &quot;Gipes&quot; appears on the coins.

King John granted the town its first charter in 1200, laying the medieval foundations of its modern civil government. Thenceforth Ipswich strongly maintained its jurisdiction over the Liberty of Ipswich, an administrative area extending over about 35 square kilometres centred on the town.

In the next four centuries it made the most of its wealth. Five large religious houses, including two Augustinian Priories (St Peter and St Paul, and Holy Trinity, both mid-12th century), and those of the Ipswich Greyfriars (Franciscans, before 1298), Ipswich Whitefriars (Carmelites founded 1278–79) and Ipswich Blackfriars (Dominicans, before 1263), stood in medieval Ipswich. The last Carmelite Prior of Ipswich was the celebrated John Bale, author of the oldest English historical verse-drama (&quot;Kynge Johan&quot;, ). There were also several hospitals, including the leper hospital of St Mary Magdalene, founded before 1199.

During the Middle Ages the Marian Shrine of Our Lady of Grace was a famous pilgrimage destination, and attracted many pilgrims including Henry VIII and Katherine of Aragon. At the Reformation the statue was taken away to London to be burned, though some claim that it survived and is preserved at Nettuno, Italy.

Around 1380, Geoffrey Chaucer satirised the merchants of Ipswich in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. Thomas Wolsey, the future cardinal, was born in Ipswich in 1473 as the son of a wealthy landowner. One of Henry VIII&#x27;s closest political allies, he founded a college in the town in 1528, which was for its brief duration one of the homes of the Ipswich School. He remains one of the town&#x27;s most famed figures.

===Early-modern era===
During the 14th to 17th centuries Ipswich was a kontor for the Hanseatic League, the port being used for imports and exports to the Baltic.

In the time of Queen Mary the Ipswich Martyrs were burnt at the stake on the Cornhill for their Protestant beliefs. A monument commemorating this event now stands in Christchurch Park. Ipswich was a printing, bookseller centre, and an entrepôt for continental books in the 16th century. From 1611 to 1634 Ipswich was a major centre for emigration to New England. This was encouraged by the Town Lecturer, Samuel Ward. His brother Nathaniel Ward was first minister of Ipswich, Massachusetts, where a promontory was named &#x27;Castle Hill&#x27; after the place of that name in north-west Ipswich, UK. Ipswich was also one of the main ports of embarkation for puritans leaving other East Anglian towns and villages for the Massachusetts Bay Colony during the 1630s and what has become known as the Great Migration.

The painter Thomas Gainsborough lived and worked in Ipswich. In 1835, Charles Dickens stayed in Ipswich and used it as a setting for scenes in his novel &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;. The hotel where he resided first opened in 1518; it was then known as The Tavern and later became known as the Great White Horse Hotel. Dickens made the hotel famous in chapter XXII of &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;, vividly describing the hotel&#x27;s meandering corridors and stairs.

===19th and 20th centuries===
In 1824 Dr George Birkbeck, with support from several local businessmen, founded one of the first Mechanics&#x27; Institutes, which survives to this day as the independent Ipswich Institute reading room and library. The building is located at 15 Tavern Street.

In the mid-19th century coprolite (fossilised animal dung) was discovered; the material was mined and then dissolved in acid, the resulting mixture forming the basis of Fisons fertiliser business.

The Tolly Cobbold brewery, built in the 18th century and rebuilt in 1894–96, is one of the finest Victorian breweries in the UK. There was a Cobbold brewery in the town from 1746 until 2002 when Ridley&#x27;s Breweries took Tolly Cobbold over. Felix Thornley Cobbold presented Christchurch Mansion to the town in 1896. Smaller breweries include St Jude&#x27;s Brewery, situated in an 18th-century coach-house near the town centre.

Ipswich was subject to bombing by German Zeppelins during World War I but the greatest damage by far occurred during the German bombing raids of World War II. The area in and around the docks was especially devastated. Eighty civilians died by enemy action in the Ipswich county borough area during the latter war. The last bombs to fall on Ipswich landed on Seymour Road at 2a.m. on 2 March 1945, killing nine people and destroying six houses.

The Willis Building is a glass-clad building owned by Willis. Designed by Norman Foster, the building dates from 1974, when it was known as the Willis Faber &amp; Dumas building. It became the youngest grade I listed building in Britain in 1991, being at the time one of only two listed buildings to be less than thirty years old.

In September 1993, Ipswich and Arras, Nord Pas-de-Calais, France, became twin towns, and a square in the new Buttermarket development was named Arras Square to mark the relationship.

Ipswich formerly had a municipal airport to the south-east of the town, which was opened in 1929 by the Ipswich Corporation. The airport was controversially closed in 1996. The site was redeveloped for housing as the Ravenswood estate.

===21st century===
Ipswich has experienced a building boom in the early part of the 21st century. Construction has mainly concentrated around the former industrial dock which is now known as the Ipswich Waterfront. Regeneration to the area has made it a hub of culture in Ipswich, the area boasts fine dining restaurants, a boutique hotel, and the new regional university, the University of Suffolk. The new high rise buildings of the Regatta Quay development has topped the list of the tallest buildings in Ipswich. The mixed-use high rise building, The Mill, is currently the tallest building in Suffolk.

Ipswich has made several unsuccessful bids for city status. The town does not have a cathedral, so the Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich is based at Bury St Edmunds, the former county town of West Suffolk.

Ipswich is the largest town in Suffolk, followed by Lowestoft and Bury St Edmunds, and the third-largest population centre in East Anglia, after Peterborough and Norwich. It is northeast of London and in 2011 had a population of 144,957. The Ipswich built-up area is the fourth-largest in the East of England and the 42nd-largest in England and Wales. It includes the towns and villages of Kesgrave, Woodbridge, Bramford and Martlesham Heath.

==Localities==
The waterfront is now devoted primarily to leisure use and includes extensive recent development of residential apartment blocks and a university campus. Businesses operated from the dock include luxury boats and a timber merchant. Other industries have been established to the south of the wet dock. The area was flooded in 2013 during a tidal surge. In February 2019 a flood gate, which protects the &quot;New Cut&quot;, was unveiled. The flood barrier, similar in design to the Thames Barrier, cost £67m. The Ipswich Village Development, begun in 2002 around Russell Road, is home to Suffolk County Council and Ipswich Borough Council.

Holywells Ward, Ipswich is the area around Holywells Park, a public park situated near the docks, and the subject of a painting by Thomas Gainsborough. Alexandra Park is the nearest park to the waterfront&#x27;s northern quay, and situated on Back Hamlet, adjacent to University of Suffolk.

Localities outside the town centre include Bixley Farm, Broke Hall, California, Castle Hill, Chantry, The Dales, Gainsborough, Greenwich, Maidenhall, Pinewood, Priory Heath, Racecourse, Ravenswood (built on a former airfield), Rose Hill, Rushmere, Springvale, St Margarets, Stoke, Warren Heath, Westbourne, Whitehouse and Whitton.

To the east of the town is Trinity Park near Bucklesham the home of the annual Suffolk Show, a typical county show. The &#x27;Trinity&#x27; is the name given to the three animals native to the county of Suffolk, namely Red Poll cattle, the powerful Suffolk Punch horse and the black-faced Suffolk sheep.

==Culture==

Ipswich is home to many artists and has a number of galleries, the most prominent of which are at Christchurch Mansion, the Town Hall, Ancient House and the Artists&#x27; Gallery in Electric House. The visual arts are further supported with many sculptures at easily accessible sites. The Borough Council promotes the creation of new public works of art and has been known to make this a condition of planning permission. The town has three museums: Ipswich Museum, the Ipswich Transport Museum and Christchurch Mansion.

The New Wolsey Theatre is a 400-seat theatre situated on Civic Drive. Although the Wolsey Theatre was built in 1979, The New Wolsey Company took on the management and running of the Wolsey Theatre in 2000, opening its first production in February 2001.

DanceEast, which has the primary aim of advocating innovation and development of dance in the East of England is now resident in their new premises as part of the waterfront development. They are building new premises as part of the waterfront development. These are the first custom built dance facilities in the east of England at a cost of around £8 million.

Spill Festival of Performance was launched in Ipswich in 2007 and alternates between London and Ipswich yearly. In 2018, Clarion Call is the signature installation in the Festival Installed at the historic town centre and waterfront in Ipswich, Clarion Call is a sonic intervention calls out to the setting sun in daily incantations, its voices reflecting contemporary Britain while exploring the local history of the World War I, using audio technology originally employed in war and emergencies, and the voices and songs of women and girls, to create a soundscape of immense scale.

Eastern Angles Theatre Company is based at the Sir John Mills Theatre in Ipswich, named after the famous actor who lived in Felixstowe as a child. In 2012 it celebrated its 30th anniversary. The group engages in rural tours and seasonal performances.

The Ipswich Arts Festival, known as &#x27;Ip-art&#x27; has been the town&#x27;s annual summer arts festival since 2003 and seen a developing and varied programme of events from visual arts, performing arts, literature, film and music, notably a free music day in Christchurch Park. The Ultrazang monthly live music night began in 2009.

The Ipswich Jazz Festival is a jazz music and arts festival started in 2015 in partnership with the Ipswich Arts Festival and mixes established jazz talent, rising stars and regional players.

===Radio===
The town has five local radio stations, BBC Radio Suffolk which broadcast from its studios on St Matthews Street in the town, the commercial station Heart East which was founded in 1975 as Radio Orwell covering the A14 corridor in Suffolk, and Ipswich 102 who took over the FM frequency in 2018, until 2020 when it rebranded as Greatest Hits Radio Ipswich &amp; Suffolk. Then in September 2022, the station was rebranded again as Nation Radio Suffolk where it has one local show on weekday afternoons 1pm-4pm, hosted by Rob Chandler (who hosted the local afternoon show prior to the rebrand). The younger audience was catered for with Suffolk-based Kiss 105-108, until September 2023 when its 106.4 frequency flipped over to carrying Greatest Hits Radio Ipswich &amp; Suffolk. Ipswich Community Radio was launched in 2007. 
===Newspapers===
The town&#x27;s daily newspaper is the &quot;Ipswich Star&quot;, a sister title to the county&#x27;s daily newspaper the &quot;East Anglian Daily Times&quot;.

==Buildings==

In addition to the Christchurch Mansion and Ancient House, Ipswich in the 21st century has some important cultural buildings including the New Wolsey Theatre and the Regent Theatre—the largest theatre venue in East Anglia where, in 1964, the Beatles performed when it was still known as the Gaumont. There is also the Corn Exchange in King Street which was completed in 1882.

There are several medieval Ipswich churches but the grandest is St. Mary-le-Tower, rebuilt by the Victorians. Holy Trinity Church by the waterfront is one of the few churches in the country which was built during the reign of William IV and whilst the outside looks plain, the interior is quite spectacular. The world&#x27;s oldest circle of church bells is housed in St Lawrence Church, which is maintained by the Ipswich Historic Churches Trust.

The Ancient House in the Buttermarket is an example of a merchant house which features tudor pargeting and the Ipswich window.

The former East Suffolk County Hall is just east of the centre of Ipswich. It is listed as a building at risk by the Victorian Society. The Town Hall remains in use as an arts centre and events venue; it dates from 1866 (architects: Bellamy &amp; Hardy of Lincoln). The 18th Century Grade II listed Old Post Office, which was built in 1881, has been renovated and is now home to the Botanist bar.

Modern buildings include Endeavour House (headquarters of Suffolk County Council and formerly home of the TXU Corporation), Grafton House (home of Ipswich Borough Council) and Ipswich Crown Court, all located on Russell Road in the area known as the Ipswich Village Development, which includes Portman Road stadium. The stadium has hosted England under-21, under-23, and international soccer matches, as well as rugby union and hockey matches.

In the waterfront area The Mill is the tallest building in East Anglia, reaching 23 storeys.

On the north-west side of Ipswich lies Broomhill Pool, a Grade II listed Olympic-sized lido which opened in 1938 and closed in 2002, since which time a campaign to see it restored and re-opened has been run by the Broomhill Pool Trust. On the southern side of Ipswich is historic Belstead Lodge, now the Belstead Brook Hotel.

==Governance==

The Municipal Borough of Ipswich was created in 1836 by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. It was the form of local government for the ancient borough of Ipswich until the Local Government Act 1888 replaced it with the County Borough of Ipswich in 1889. Both originated from the ancient borough of Ipswich. The local authority was Ipswich Corporation. Following the passage of the Reform Act 1832, the government set up a Royal Commission in July 1833 to investigate how local councils worked. In 1974 it was replaced by the non-metropolitan district of Ipswich and Ipswich Borough Council became the local authority, with county council duties fulfilled by Suffolk County Council.

Following the Local Government Act 1888, the county of Suffolk outside of Ipswich was split into East Suffolk and West Suffolk for administrative purposes and the term administrative county was introduced. There was a level of continuity as Ipswich was still run by the Ipswich Corporation, independently from East Suffolk (which surrounded it), although the county council was based in Ipswich at East Suffolk County Hall.

In 1974 following the Local Government Act 1972 and Ipswich became a non-metropolitan district with borough status in the administrative county of Suffolk with the same boundaries as the abolished county borough.

Ipswich is governed locally by a two-tier council system. Ipswich Borough Council fulfils district council functions such as refuse collection, housing and planning and Suffolk County Council provides the county council services such as transport, education and social services.

The town is covered by two parliamentary constituencies: Ipswich, which is represented by Labour MP Jack Abbott and covers about 75% of the town, and Central Suffolk &amp; North Ipswich, which covers the remaining 25% and is represented by Conservative MP Patrick Spencer.

In April 2006 the borough council initiated public discussions about the idea of turning the borough into a unitary authority; Ipswich had constituted a county borough from 1889 to 1974, independent of the administrative county of East Suffolk, and this status was not restored by the Banham/Cooksey Commission in the 1990s. Ipswich, Norwich, Exeter and Oxford united to campaign for unitary authority status for the four towns. In March 2007, it was announced that Ipswich was one of 16 shortlisted councils. In December 2007 plans were put into doubt as the government announced that it had &quot;delayed&quot; the unitary bids for Ipswich and Exeter. In July 2008 the Boundary Committee announced its preferred option was for a unitary authority covering Ipswich and the south eastern corner of Suffolk, including Felixstowe.

==Industry==
Being the county town of agricultural Suffolk, industry around Ipswich has had a strong farming bias with Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies Ltd, one of the most famous agricultural manufacturers, located in the town. The world&#x27;s first commercial motorised lawnmower was built by Ransomes in 1902. Ransomes &amp; Rapier was a major British manufacturer of railway equipment and later cranes, from 1869 to 1987. There was a sugar beet factory at Ipswich for many years; it was closed in 2001 as part of a rationalisation by British Sugar. This agricultural link is preserved in the local football club&#x27;s nickname &quot;The Tractor Boys&quot;. Phillips &amp; Piper Ltd on Old Foundry Road employed many women who sewed equestrian and hunt jackets for Harrods, Pytchley, and other labels for 130 years, finally closing down in June 1982.

The British Telecom Research Laboratories were located to the east of the town in 1975 at Martlesham Heath; it is now a science park called Adastral Park. The area was originally RAF Martlesham Heath, a World War II airfield. Part of the old airfield is now the site of Suffolk Constabulary&#x27;s police headquarters.

A key employment sector is insurance, both wholesale and retail sectors. Some of the major players with a key presence in Ipswich include Axa, Churchill, Legal &amp; General, LV and Willis Towers Watson. Access to a skilled and experienced workforce has also led to the establishment of ancillary businesses serving these companies, including call centres dealing with sales and claims.

Ipswich is one of the Haven ports and is still a working port, handling several million tonnes of cargo each year. Prior to decommissioning, HMS &quot;Grafton&quot; was a regular visitor to the port and has special links with the town and the county of Suffolk. HMS &quot;Orwell&quot;, named after the river, is also closely linked with Ipswich.

==Transport==


Ipswich railway station is on the Great Eastern Main Line from London to Norwich, the East Suffolk Line to Lowestoft and the Felixstowe Branch Line. Trains are run by Greater Anglia, which operates direct services to cities including London, Cambridge, Chelmsford, Norwich and Peterborough. Ipswich engine shed opened in 1846 and closed in 1968. Ipswich is still a signing-on point for locomotive crews and a stabling point. The town has a smaller suburban station at Derby Road east of the town centre, on the Felixstowe branch line.

Ipswich is close to the A12 and the A14 roads. The Orwell Bridge which carries the A14 over the River Orwell connects it to the Port of Felixstowe, a major container port to the east.

Bus services in Ipswich are operated by Ipswich Buses, First Eastern Counties, Beestons and several smaller companies. Town services operate mainly from Tower Ramparts bus station and regional services from the Ipswich Old Cattle Market bus station. Ipswich Airport closed in 1996.

Ipswich is on Sustrans&#x27;s National Cycle Route 1 and National Cycle Route 51.

==Sport==
Ipswich&#x27;s sole professional association football club is Ipswich Town, which was established in 1878 and play at the 30,300-capacity Portman Road stadium. They have competed in the Premier League since the 2024-25 season, following their promotion as runners-up from the EFL Championship in the 2023–24 season. Elected to the Football League in 1938, they have a strong rivalry with Norwich City, and were the previous club of the two most successful England managers; Alf Ramsey, who was buried in the Old Cemetery in the town on his death in 1999, and Bobby Robson. Ipswich won the First Division title in 1961–62 in their first season as a top division club during Ramsey&#x27;s reign, as well as the 1978 FA Cup and the 1981 UEFA Cup under Robson. The club are also undefeated at home in all European competitions, having won 25 and drawn six of 31 matches.

Ipswich is also home to several non-League football clubs, including Ipswich Wanderers and Whitton United in the Eastern Counties League, and Achilles, Crane Sports, and Ransomes Sports among others in the Suffolk &amp; Ipswich League. The town has representation in both codes of rugby. There are two rugby union teams – Ipswich RFC, who play in London 2 North East League, and Ipswich YM RUFC – and one rugby league side – Ipswich Rhinos, who play in the Rugby League Conference. Ipswich Cardinals are an American football team, playing in the South-East Conference of BAFACL 1; the second tier of the BAFA Community Leagues.

The speedway team, the Ipswich Witches, have ridden at Foxhall Stadium on the outskirts of Ipswich since 1951 and have won the top-tier league title four times, the knock-out cup five times and the second-tier knock-out cup twice. The stadium is also used regularly for Hot Rod, Stock Car and Banger racing events, hosting major events throughout the year on the stadium&#x27;s outer tarmac oval.

Ipswich Gymnastics Centre is one of only three fully Olympic accredited gymnastics facilities in the UK.

Ipswich has a rich history of public swimming. During the 1830s, there were at least three designated swimming places - one was near St Cement&#x27;s, the second was next to St Mary-At-The Quay and the third not far from Stoke Bridge. These were all closed in the late 1830s during the building of the wet dock. A designated enclosed area of the River Orwell, called Stoke Bathing Place, was created to cater for the swimmers. It was damaged in the floods of 1953 but maps show the swimming place still in situ as late as 1973. Ipswich Swimming, formed in 1884 as Ipswich Swimming Club, used the Stoke Swimming Place. Fore Street Swimming Pool opened in 1894. The pool is still in use and is the second oldest swimming pool in is in the UK. Pipers Vale Pool opened in 1937 after replacing the West End Bathing Place, which had closed in 1936 due to fears that it was polluting the River Orwell. Broom Hill pool opened, in 1986, which was prompted to serve the western side of the town. It closed in 2002 but is about to be restored with the plan of opening again in 2025/26. St Matthew&#x27;s Baths was opened in 1924 and closed in 1984 when Crown Pools opened, which is still in use. The Ipswich Swimming Club, is based there although they use the Fore Street swimming pool, too. The most successful Ipswich Swimming Club member is World Championship gold medallist Karen Pickering. There are plans for a new &quot;low carbon aquatics centre&quot; with the intention of opening next to Ipswich Town Football Club in 2027.

Ipswich had a racecourse which ran a mix of flat and National Hunt races.

==Education==
===Schools===


State-funded secondary schools include comprehensive schools such as Copleston High School, St Alban&#x27;s Catholic High School, Holbrook Academy, Holbrook Primary and Northgate High School and academies such as Ipswich Academy and Chantry Academy. Ipswich is also home to several independent schools, including Royal Hospital School, Ipswich School (both are co-educational and members of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference), Ipswich High School (has recently changed from girls only to girls and boys) and St Joseph&#x27;s College (Catholic, co-educational) which hosts an international summer camp.

===Further and higher education===
Suffolk New College is a further education college located in Ipswich, serving students from the town and wider area. There is also a sixth form college, One, which serves students from the same area.

Ipswich is the location of the University of Suffolk, Suffolk&#x27;s first Higher Education Institution (HEI), established in 2007. It was originally University Campus Suffolk, a collaborative venture involving the University of Essex in Colchester, the University of East Anglia in Norwich, various further education colleges and Suffolk County Council. However, the university was granted its own degree awarding powers in November 2015, and in May 2016 it was awarded university status. The university was renamed to the University of Suffolk in August 2016, prior to its former name University Campus Suffolk.

==Climate==
Ipswich experiences an oceanic climate, like the rest of the British Isles, with a narrow range of temperature and rainfall spread evenly throughout the year. One of the two nearest for which data is available is East Bergholt, about south west of the town centre and at a similar elevation, and similar river valley/estuary situation. The average July maximum of is the third-highest for a major settlement in the country, behind London and Colchester, illustrating the relative warmth of the area during the summer part of the year. The record maximum is , set during August 2003. Typically, 24.9 days of the year will record a maximum temperature of or above, and the warmest day of the year should reach , on average.

The absolute minimum is , set in January 1963, although frosts have been recorded in all months except July, August and September. In an average year, 55.33 nights will report an air frost. The lowest temperature to be recorded in recent years was during December 2010.

As with much of East Anglia, rainfall is low, averaging 569.3mm in a typical year, with 103.8 days of the year reporting over 1mm of rain. All averages refer to the period 1971–2000.

The weather station at Levington is even closer than East Bergholt at from the town centre further down the river estuary on the way to Felixstowe. It has a slightly more marine climate than East Bergholt, with slightly lower highs and milder lows throughout the year in the 1981–2010 average period. It is slightly less prone to frosts, averaging 35.5 such occurrences in a calendar year. Sunshine levels at 1,707.7 hours per annum are relatively high for the British Isles, but not abnormal for southern parts of England.

Wattisham is from Ipswich, but has a higher altitude of . As a result, high temperatures there are a little lower than East Bergholt and Levington, but lows are similar. In average year, there are around 43 nights of frost recorded at Wattisham (as well as two days of frost), and one day when the temperature exceeds .

<text>Cratippus (; fl.  375 BC) was a Greek historian. There are only three or four references to him in ancient literature, and his importance derives from him being identified by several scholars (e.g. Blass) with the author of the historical fragment discovered by Grenfell and Hunt. The fragment itself was published in &quot;Oxyrhynchus Papyri&quot;, vol. v, and is known as the &quot;Hellenica Oxyrhynchia&quot;. It may be regarded as a fairly certain inference from a passage in Plutarch (&quot;&quot;, p. 345 E, ed. Bernardakis, ii. p. 455) that he was an Athenian writer, intermediate in date between Thucydides and Xenophon, and that his work continued the narrative of Thucydides, from the point at which the latter historian stopped (410 BC) down to the Battle of Cnidus.

A recent edition of the surviving papyrus fragments is V. Bartoletti, &quot;Hellenica Oxyrhynchia&quot; (Leipzig, 1959), which includes a bibliography.

<text>Hadleigh () is an ancient market town and civil parish in the Babergh district of Suffolk, England. The town is situated next to the River Brett, between the larger towns of Sudbury and Ipswich. It had a population of 8,253 at the 2011 census. The headquarters of Babergh District Council were located in the town until 2017.

==Origin of the name==
Skeat, in his 1913 &quot;The Place-Names of Suffolk&quot;, says this:

Spelt &quot;Hadlega&quot;, R.B.; &quot;Hadleigh&quot;, Ipm.; &quot;Hædleage&quot;, in a late chapter, Thorpe, Diplomat, 527; &quot;Headlega&quot;, Annals of St Neot, quoted in Plummer&#x27;s ed. of the A.S.Chronicle, ii. 102; &quot;Hetlega&quot;, D.B., p.184. In D.B. the &quot;t&quot; stands for &quot;th&quot;; and the true A.S. form appears in a Worcs. charter, dated 849, as &quot;hæðleage&quot;(gen.) with reference to Headley Heath (a tautological name) in Birch, C.S. ii. 40; see Duignan, Placenames of Worcs. The sense is &#x27;heath-lea.&#x27; In a similar way the A.S. ð has become t in Hatfield (Herts.) which means &#x27;heath-field&#x27;.
==History==
Guthrum, King of the Danes, is said to be buried in the grounds of St Mary&#x27;s Church in the town. He was defeated by King Alfred at the battle of Edington in 878.

The first documented lord of the manor was ealdorman Byrhtnoth, who was killed at the Battle of Maldon in 991. Hadleigh received its market charter in 1252 and had a grammar school by 1275. The manor of Hadleigh, along with those of Lawling in Essex and Monks Eleigh in Suffolk, were among those given to the Priory Church of Canterbury Cathedral. It made Hadleigh an &quot;archiepiscopal peculiar&quot; – under the direct control of the Archbishop of Canterbury.

Hadleigh was a moderately-sized town, with a reckoned population of about 1,100 or 1,200 in 1306. At that time there were 118 &quot;unfree tenants&quot;, who had to pay rent and provide labour services, and 75 &quot;free tenants&quot; who had had fewer obligations and dues. The manor had . The manor was a working farm, with crops and some animals, and had quite an important dairy. Hadleigh Hall was the site of the medieval manor house, in .

It has been suggested by Woods (2018) that Wat Tyler and his wife were Hadleigh tenants about 20 years before he was one of the leaders of the 1381 Peasants&#x27; Revolt. Records show a Wat Tyler taking over a freeholding in Coram Street in 1358–59 and it is possible he worked as a tiler.

In 1438, administration was passed from manorial control to trustees. The market was eventually sold to Babergh District Council in the late 20th century.

Hadleigh was one of the East Anglian towns that derived its prosperity from its wool and cloth industries. It has a 15th-century timber-framed Guildhall and many fine examples of timber and brick listed buildings, some with highly detailed 17th century plasterwork or &quot;pargeting&quot;. Most of these buildings can be found in the High Street, Angel Street, Benton Street and George Street.

The Guildhall buildings are, in fact, formed of three separate structures, all of which lie to the south of the churchyard: the Market House, the Guilds Halls and the New Town Hall (Grand Hall). They are located on land that belonged originally to the manor of Toppesfield Hall. In 1252, king Henry III of England granted a weekly market and an annual fair to Gilbert de Kirkeby, his wife Lauretta and their heirs. By 1438, the Lord of the Manor was William de Clopton, who granted these rights, to fifteen trustees, with an initial annual payment of 6s 8d. In 1438, the Hadleigh Market Feoffment was formed, to manage the market and buildings. The oldest part of the complex, the Market House, fronts the churchyard. Later the Guilds Halls were built and the final addition was the New Town Hall. Abutting the Market House to the west was the &#x27;Long Hall newly built&#x27; (1438), which appears to have been the home of the Grammar School, the earliest record of which is dated 7 May 1382. Its last use was as almshouses and accommodation for the Dean&#x27;s servants; but it was seriously damaged in a storm in 1884 and was demolished.

In 1894 Hadleigh became an urban district which became part of the administrative county of West Suffolk in 1889, the district contained the parish of Hadleigh. On 1 April 1974 the district and parish were abolished and became part of Babergh district in the non-metropolitan county of Suffolk. A successor parish was formed covering the same area as the former district and its parish.

The parish has a total of 246 listed buildings. Of these, four are Grade I: the grouping of St Mary&#x27;s Church, the Deanery Tower, the Guildhall, and the Coffee Tavern in the High Street. Twenty-seven are II*. Hugh Pigot, curate of Hadleigh, identifies four &#x27;remarkable&#x27; houses in his 1866 history of the town: Sun Court; a house in the High St; a house in George Street; and Place Farm (demolished). The house in George Street has since been identified as a hall house, known as Thorpes in the 1600s, and dated to 1380–1420. It was restored by Mr and Mrs Baines and given a Noel Turner Award by the Hadleigh Society in 2012.
The Georgian East House, on George Street, is designated a Grade II* listed building. In March 2013, plans by Babergh District Council to redevelop the site and build houses on the land behind were withdrawn after strong local protest. The property was once used for community activities and the Kray twins were billeted at the property during the Second World War. Opponents of the plan had argued that the adjacent land had been used as a village green for the previous 20 years. In 2018, the building was renovated into two private homes: East House and West Lodge by period property restorers Richard Abel and Ruth McCabe-Abel. The couple were awarded the Noel Turner Award by the Hadleigh Society in 2019 for their sympathetic restoration of East House and West Lodge.

Originating in the 14th century, the Grade II* listed Toppesfield Bridge, over the River Brett, is the oldest in the county still carrying vehicles. It was widened in 1812. Hadleigh also had its own Corn Exchange, completed in 1813.

Hadleigh was formerly the home of Babergh District Council. In November 2017, the council vacated its offices on Cork Lane.

==Religion==

The Anglican church of St Mary the Virgin is an active parish church in the archdeaconry of Ipswich in the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich. Its earliest parts date from medieval times. On 26 April 1950, the church was designated a Grade I listed building by English Heritage.

According to the &quot;Annals of St Neots&quot;, a chronicle compiled in Bury St Edmunds, King Guthrum (later called Æthelstan, died c.890) was buried at &quot;Headleage,&quot; which is usually identified as Hadleigh. He may have built the original Saxon church at this site, traces of which were revealed in the churchyard to the south of the porch, in 1829 and in 1984. There is no real evidence, however, that Guthrum was the founder of the church.
In the Domesday Book, there is mention of a church at &quot;Hetlega&quot; being owned by Archbishop Lanfranc of Canterbury.

The deanery, with a tall Tudor gatehouse in brick built just before the Reformation, next to the church, is also a Grade I listed building.
Like its near neighbour, East Bergholt, Hadleigh was known during the 16th century for its Protestant radicalism. Rowland Taylor, a preacher from the town, and his curate, Richard Yeoman, were martyred by being burned at the stake during the reign of Queen Mary I. The Oxford Movement was said to have been founded in 1833 following a meeting in the deanery.

Hadleigh United Reformed Church, off Market Place, was originally the town&#x27;s Congregational Church, founded in 1688. It was rebuilt in the early 19th century and restored in 1890. The Baptist chapel was built in 1830. St Joseph&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church was built in 1966. In 1814, the Wesleyan Methodists purchased the 14th-century Thorpes hall house in George Street and leased it to the Primitive Methodists, known as Ranters, in 1836. In 1848 the Wesleyans built a chapel on land adjoining Thorpes and enlarged it in 1875. The chapel is now a Grade II listed home. There was also an Episcopal Mission Chapel built on Hadleigh Heath in 1878 and restored in 1891; it was disused by 1912.

==Economy==

The former Kings Arms on Benton Street is a typical example of timber framing. The building, a pub for over 400 years, has sections that date to the 15th century. It was known unofficially as the &quot;Old Monkey&quot; and is still referred to by that name today. It is now a private residence and bed and breakfast.

Hadleigh is home to several manufacturers, including Jim Lawrence Handcrafted Home Furnishings, and the Hadleigh Maid chocolate company. From November 2009 Hadleigh was the home of the Hellhound microbrewery; it moved to Bramford in June 2014 and ceased trading in June 2018.

The Brett Works site, off Pound Lane, was for some years the home of Brett Valley Joinery and was later allocated by Babergh District Council as a potential site for a new foodstore. Supermarket Tesco made a number of controversial proposals for the building of a store in the town. Their last proposal, for development of the Pound Lane site, was rejected by the council in July 2011. The proposal was rejected again in September 2013.

The Lady Lane Industrial estate is the location of Celotex Saint Gobain, the manufacturer of the insulation component in the cladding used at Grenfell Tower.

==Culture==
The annual Hadleigh Show, first held in 1840 and also known as &#x27;the May Show&#x27;, is one of the oldest one-day agricultural shows in East Anglia. Organised by the Hadleigh Farmers&#x27; Agricultural Association, the show enjoyed 12,500 visitors in 2013.

Benton End House, a Grade II* listed building on Benton Street, was originally a large medieval farmhouse. From 1940 it was the home of Sir Cedric Morris, artist and plantsman, who formed the East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing there. Students included Lucian Freud and Maggi Hambling.

The Ansell Community Centre was established in 2004 to provide community facilities in the locality. It operates the cinema (&quot;Hollywood in Hadleigh&quot;), organises luncheon clubs and arranges events.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received the Sudbury TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Suffolk on 103.9 FM, Heart East on 97.1 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Ipswich &amp; Suffolk on 106.4 FM, Nation Radio Suffolk on 102.0 FM and ICR FM, a community based station which broadcasts from Ipswich on 105.7 FM.

Hadleigh has its own community newspaper, Hadleigh Community News but the town is also covered by the regional newspaper, East Anglian Daily Times.

==Sport and leisure==

Hadleigh has a Non-League football club, Hadleigh United, who play at Millfield. The town is also home to Hadleigh Rugby Club (HRFC). Both the football and rugby club boast thriving youth and senior sections.

The town&#x27;s bowls and cricket clubs are among the oldest in Suffolk. The bowls club was founded in 1754. The cricket club is over 200 years old and pre-dates the Marylebone Cricket Club.

Other sporting clubs include the Hadleigh Tennis Club, Hadleigh Hares running club and Hadleigh Cycling Club.

At Benton End Farm there is an equestrian centre and a paintball centre.

A swimming pool was built in the 1960s, to which a sports centre was added in 2012; the pool was rebuilt in 2020.

<text>Friedrich Blass (22 January 1843, Osnabrück5 March 1907, Halle) was a German classical scholar.

==Biography==
After studying at Göttingen and Bonn from 1860 to 1863, Blass lectured at several gymnasia and at the University of Königsberg. In 1876 he was appointed extraordinary professor of classical philology at Kiel, and ordinary professor in 1881. In 1892 he accepted a professorship at Halle, where he later died.

He frequently visited England, and was intimately acquainted with leading British scholars. He received an honorary degree from Dublin University in 1892, and his readiness to place the results of his labours at the disposal of others, together with the courtesy and kindliness of his disposition, won the respect of all who knew him.

Blass is chiefly known for his works in connection with the study of Greek oratory: &quot;Die Attische Beredsamkeit von Alexander bis auf Augustus&quot; (1865); &quot;Die attische Beredsamkeit&quot; (1868–1880; 2nd ed., 1887–1898), his greatest work; editions for the Teubner series of &quot;Andocides&quot; (1880), &quot;Antiphon&quot; (1871, 2nd ed. 1881–1908, also including the surviving orations of Gorgias, Antisthenes, and Alcidamas), &quot;Hypereides&quot; (1881, 1894), &quot;Demosthenes&quot; (Dindorf&#x27;s ed., 1885), &quot;Isocrates&quot; (1886), &quot;Dinarchus&quot; (1888), &quot;Demosthenes&quot; (Rehdantz ed., 1893), &quot;Aeschines&quot; (1896), &quot;Lycurgus&quot;, &quot;Leocrates&quot; (1902); &quot;Die Rhythmen der attischen Kunstprosa&quot; (1901); &quot;Die Rhythmen der asianischen und römischen Kunstprosa&quot; (1905). With Bernhard Gerth, he published an enlarged edition of Kühner&#x27;s Greek grammar, &quot;Ausführliche grammatik der griechischen sprache&quot; (1890–1904, four volumes).

Among his other works are editions of Eudoxus of Cnidus (1887), the &quot;Ἀθηναίων πολιτεία&quot; (4th ed., 1903), a work of great importance, and Bacchylides (3rd. ed., 1904); &quot;Grammatik des neutestamentlichen Griechisch&quot; (1902; Eng. trans. by H St John Thackeray, 1905); &quot;Hermeneutik und Kritik&quot; and &quot;Paläographie, Buchwesen, und Handschriftenkunde&quot; (vol. i. of Müller&#x27;s &quot;Handbuch der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft&quot;, 1891); &quot;Über die Aussprache des Griechischen&quot; (1888; Eng. trans. by W. J. Purton, 1890); &quot;Die Interpolationen in der Odyssee&quot; (1904); contributions to Collitz&#x27;s &quot;Sammlung der griechischen Dialektinschriften&quot;; editions of the texts of certain portions of the New Testament (Gospels and Acts). His last work was an edition of the &quot;Choephori&quot; (1906).

See notices in the &quot;Academy,&quot; 16 March 1907 (JP Mahaffy); &quot;Classical Review,&quot; May 1907 (JE Sandys), which contains also a review of &quot;Die Rhythmen der asianischen und römischen Kunstprosa&quot;.

<text>Hunstanton (sometimes pronounced ) is a seaside town in Norfolk, England, which had a population of 4,229 at the 2011 Census. It faces west across The Wash. Hunstanton lies 102 miles (164 km) north-north-east of London and 40 miles (64 km) north-west of Norwich.

==History==
Hunstanton is a 19th-century resort town, initially known as New Hunstanton to distinguish it from the adjacent village of that name. The new town soon exceeded the village in scale and population.

The original settlement, now Old Hunstanton, probably gained its name from the River Hun, which runs to the coast just to the east. It has also been argued that the name originated from &quot;Honeystone&quot;, referring to the local red carr stone. The river begins in the grounds of Old Hunstanton Park, which surrounds the moated Hunstanton Hall, the ancestral home of the Le Strange family. Old Hunstanton village is of prehistoric origin and lies near to the head of Peddars Way. In 1970, evidence of Neolithic settlement was found. The quiet character of the village remains distinct from its busy sibling and complements it with clifftop walks past a redundant lighthouse and the ruins of St Edmund&#x27;s Chapel, built in 1272.

In 1846, Henry L&#x27;Estrange Styleman Le Strange (1815–1862), decided to develop the area south of Old Hunstanton as a bathing resort. He brought a group of like-minded investors into building a railway line from King&#x27;s Lynn. In 1861, Le Strange, as principal landowner, became a director of the railway company. By 1862 the line had been built. Le Strange died that year at the age of 47, leaving his son Hamon to reap the rewards of his efforts. The Lynn and Hunstanton Railway became one of the most consistently profitable in the country.

Le Strange moved the ancient village cross from Old Hunstanton to a new site in 1846. In 1848 the first main building, the Royal Hotel (now the &quot;Golden Lion&quot;), was built by Victorian architect, William Butterfield, a friend of Le Strange. Overlooking a sloping green and the sea, and for several years standing alone, it earned the nickname &quot;Le Strange&#x27;s Folly&quot;. In 1850 Le Strange, an amateur architect and painter, appointed a land agent to survey the site and prepare a plan. Le Strange drew and painted a map and a perspective of the scheme, showing shops, a station and a church. He consulted William Butterfield on the design. Their shared passion was for an &quot;Old English&quot; style of architecture for domestic buildings, owing much to medieval precedents and the earnest Victorian Gothic Revival. Hunstanton came to exemplify a 19th-century estate seaside town. Most of the fabric and character of that development survives.

In 1915, during the First World War, Hunstanton was the headquarters of the West Norfolk training programme of the Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders, as they prepared for active service on the Western Front. Among them were regimental bagpiper Iain Eairdsidh MacAsgaill (1898-1934), and poet Dòmhnall Ruadh Chorùna (1887-1967).

Hunstanton was hit badly by the North Sea flood of 1953. The wall of water on the night of 31 January – 1 February killed 31 people, 16 of them United States military personnel and their families. There were 35 more victims in neighbouring Snettisham and Heacham.

==Governance==
The Hunstanton electoral ward belongs to the Borough Council of King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk. Its 2011 population was 5,420. Hunstanton has a mayor and a 17-member town council that meets twice a month at Hunstanton Town Hall. The parish was formed as &quot;New Hunstanton&quot; in 1894 from &quot;Hunstanton&quot;. On 1 April 1974 &quot;New Hunstanton&quot; parish was renamed &quot;Hunstanton&quot; and &quot;Hunstanton&quot; parish renamed &quot;Old Hunstanton&quot;.

==Geology==

 The coastal cliffs include the type section of the Hunstanton Formation of lower reddish limestone, which was laid down during the Lower Cretaceous. This is topped by a white chalk layer from the Upper Cretaceous period.

==Climate==
==Tourism==

Hunstanton&#x27;s summer crowds are smaller than in the 1980s, although its relative popularity with day-trippers and holidaymakers has endured, despite the decline in British seaside holidaying. Businesses in villages south of Hunstanton (Dersingham, Ingoldisthorpe and Snettisham) complained in the 1990s of a loss in trade after being bypassed by the A149 to Hunstanton.

The town has several Victorian squares. Boston Square provides a view across the Wash to Boston, Lincolnshire where both Boston Stump and the seaside town of Skegness are visible on clear days.

Hunstanton has a fairground, aquarium and seal sanctuary, leisure pool, theatre, large caravan parks with amenities, some amusement arcades, and a long promenade. The centrepiece remains the large sloping green from one end of High Street to the promenade.

Hunstanton has markets on Wednesdays and Sundays selling fresh fish and fresh fruit and vegetables attract greater visitor numbers in the summer months through to the autumn. The main shopping streets have stone buildings, some with glazed canopies, evoking the Victorian and Edwardian eras of their construction.

In good weather, excursion boats take visitors out to view grey and common seals that have colonised sand bars in the Wash and to the north of Norfolk. The countryside around Hunstanton is hillier than most of Norfolk and sparsely populated, the only large settlement nearby is King&#x27;s Lynn, to the south.

==Hunstanton Pier==
The town once had a Victorian pleasure pier, with a pavilion and miniature steam railway. The pier pavilion was destroyed by fire in 1939, the pier was damaged by fire again in the 1950s, before almost the entire structure was washed away by a storm in 1978. What remained extended just 15 feet out from the amusement arcade and cafe built on the site of the original entrance. In 2002, the entire building, with the remains of the pier, was destroyed in a fire. The building was too badly damaged for the cause to be determined. Today, the site is occupied by an arcade and bowling alley complex.

The pier featured in the 1957 Ealing Studios comedy film &quot;Barnacle Bill&quot; (released in the US as &quot;All at Sea&quot;) starring Alec Guinness.

==Transport==
The town is linked to King&#x27;s Lynn by a frequent Lynx bus service. Other services run to Sandringham, Wells-next-the-Sea, Sheringham and Cromer.

Hunstanton railway station offered services to King&#x27;s Lynn until 1969, when the line was closed as uneconomic.

==Education==
The Smithdon High School (formerly Hunstanton Secondary Modern School) is an early building designed by the architects Peter and Alison Smithson, built in 1949–1954 in a radical style of international architectural significance. It is a Grade II* listed building.

The school epitomised architectural experiment in post-war Britain and growing acceptance of modernism by public authorities. It was praised for an intelligent layout and formal elegance. The Smithsons deliberately left many of the service elements of the school exposed, making a feature of the water tank by turning it into a tower. The disposition, steel frames and panels of brick and glass echo the work of Mies van der Rohe at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Hunstanton is home to Glebe House School, an independent co-educational preparatory school.

==Theatre, cinema and culture==
The Princess Theatre is a 472-seat, year-round venue for shows from comedy to drama, music for all tastes, and children&#x27;s productions. It also has a six-week summer season and an annual Christmas pantomime. Films are screened in the week. Opened as the Capitol Cinema in 1932, it is noted for its Norfolk carr stone construction, of which it contains the largest gable wall in existence. It was designed as a theatre as well as a cinema, but closed in the 1960s and was sold in 1974. It reopened as the Kingsley Centre for summer seasons and films for about two years, but declined into a bingo hall before closing again. The Borough Council of King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk purchased it in 1981, and in honour of Lady Diana Spencer, who married the Prince of Wales in July 1981, it was renamed the Princess Theatre and officially re-opened on 5 July 1981.

Hunstanton Concert Band plays in and around Hunstanton at a wide variety of venues including churches, fêtes, concerts and the town&#x27;s bandstand. The Deaf Havana album &quot;Fools and Worthless Liars&quot; featured a track called &quot;Hunstanton Pier&quot;, a nostalgic recollection of the town where James Veck-Gilodi, its lead singer, grew up.

===Literary associations===

Between the world wars, P. G. Wodehouse often visited his friend Charles Le Strange at Hunstanton Hall. It influenced a number of locations in his comic novels, as Aunt Agatha&#x27;s country seat Woollam Chersey and the inspiration for the setting for &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; (1928). The octagon in the garden featured in &quot;Jeeves and the Impending Doom&quot;. Norfolk also furnishes names for many of Wodehouse&#x27;s characters, such as Brancaster, Jack Snettisham and J. Sheringham Adair.

L. P. Hartley knew the Hunstanton neighbourhood from childhood holidays and used it as a setting for &quot;The Shrimp and the Anemone&quot; (1944), the first novel in his Eustace and Hilda trilogy. It is at Hunstanton Hall, fictionalised as Anchorstone Hall, that Eustace enters the privileged world of the aristocracy and eventually inherits a small fortune. The layered chalk, red chalk and carr-stone cliffs at Hunstanton provide a backdrop for Eustace and Hilda&#x27;s games among the rock pools.

Patrick Hamilton&#x27;s novel &quot;Hangover Square&quot; opens with George Harvey Bone walking on the cliffs in Hunstanton. Hamilton lived for many years at Martincross in Sheringham and spent time in the 1930s in a cottage in Burnham Overy Staithe, with his first wife, Lois.

==Media==
Regional TV services are provided by BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Belmont TV transmitter.BBC East and ITV Anglia are also received through cable and satellite television such as Freesat and Sky.

==Sport==

Hunstanton attracts thousands during a week in August, for the ITA Hunstanton Lawn Tennis tournament – the biggest in England after Wimbledon, inaugurated in 1920. All ages can play from the young (Under 8 Round Robin) to senior veterans. It acts also as a big social event.

Hunstanton Golf Club, founded in 1891 by Hamon Le Strange, is an 18-hole championship links along the sandy coast of Old Hunstanton. It has a classic &quot;out and back&quot; design on either side of a central spine or dune ridge. The 12th, 13th and 14th holes play across the ridge.

The town has hosted several international sporting events, including the 2005 World Water Ski Racing Championships.

<doc id="99667" wikidata="Q1021319" url="?curid=99667" title="Sudbury, Suffolk">
<text>Sudbury (, ) is a market town and civil parish in the south west of Suffolk, England, on the River Stour near the Essex border, north-east of London. It is the largest town in the Babergh local government district and part of the South Suffolk constituency. In 2021, the built-up area had a population of 23,912 and the parish had a population of 13,619.

Sudbury was an Anglo-Saxon settlement from the end of the 8th century, and its market was established in the early 11th century. Its textile industries prospered in the Late Middle Ages, the wealth of which funded many of its buildings and churches. The town became notable for its art in the 18th century, being the birthplace of Thomas Gainsborough, whose landscapes offered inspiration to John Constable, another Suffolk painter of the surrounding Stour Valley area. The 19th century saw the arrival of the railway with the opening of a station on the historic Stour Valley Railway, and Sudbury railway station forms the current terminus of the Gainsborough Line. In World War II, US Army Air Forces bombers operated from RAF Sudbury.

Today, Sudbury retains its status as a market town with a twice-weekly market in the town centre in front of St Peter&#x27;s Church, which is now a cultural venue for events such as concerts and exhibitions. In sport, the town has a semi-professional football club, A.F.C. Sudbury, which competes at the seventh level of the football pyramid.

It is home to the Gainsborough&#x27;s House museum, celebrating the work of the artist.

==History==

===Early history===
Sudbury&#x27;s history dates back into the age of the Saxons. The town&#x27;s earliest mention is in &quot;circa&quot; 799, when Ælfhun, Bishop of Dunwich, died in the town. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records the town as &quot;Suðberie&quot; (&quot;south-borough&quot;), presumed to distinguish it from Norwich or Bury St Edmunds, to the north, and is recorded as &quot;Suðbyrig&quot;. The town is also mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, as a market town where the local people came to barter their goods. The market was established in 1009. During this period the town was surrounded by a defensive ditch and a diverted section of the River Stour.

The Church of All Saints was established in the 12th century before being bought by Adam the Monk, who then passed the church and its lands to the Abbey of St Albans. St Bartholemew&#x27;s Benedictine Priory and the Chapel of Holy Sepulchre were also established in the 12th century.

A community of Dominicans established Sudbury Priory in the mid-13th century and gradually extended the size of their priory, which was one of three Dominican priories in the county of Suffolk. A leper hospital was founded on the outskirts of the town in 1272.

Sudbury was one of the first towns in which Edward III settled the Flemings, allowing the weaving and silk industries to prosper for centuries during the Late Middle Ages. As the main town in the area, Sudbury prospered too, and many great houses and churches were built, giving the town a major historical legacy. The Woolsack in the House of Lords was originally stuffed with wool from the Sudbury area, a sign of both the importance of the wool industry and of the wealth of the donors.

One citizen of Sudbury, Archbishop Simon Sudbury showed that not even the Tower of London guarantees safety. On 14 June 1381, guards opened the Tower&#x27;s doors and allowed a party of rebellious peasants to enter. Sudbury, inventor of the poll tax, was dragged to Tower Hill and beheaded. His body was afterwards buried in Canterbury Cathedral, but his skull is kept in St Gregory&#x27;s Church, one of the three medieval churches in Sudbury. Simon&#x27;s concerns for his native town are reflected in the founding of St Leonard&#x27;s Hospital in 1372, a place of respite, towards Long Melford, for lepers. For the College of St Gregory, which he founded in 1375 to support eight priests, he used his father&#x27;s former house and an adjoining plot.

From the 16th to 18th century. the weaving industry was less consistently profitable and Sudbury experienced periods of varying prosperity. By means of the borough court, the mayor and corporation directed the affairs of the town. They built a house of correction (1624) for &#x27;rogues, vagabonds and sturdy beggars&#x27; and tried to finance the reconstruction of Ballingdon Bridge, which disappeared during a storm on 4 September 1594. Among theatrical companies that they paid to visit Sudbury were Lord Strange&#x27;s Men (1592) and the King&#x27;s Men (1610). Minor infringements, such as not attending church, were punished by fines; for worse offenders there was a stocks or a whipping. During the Civil War, a 12-strong band of watchmen was created to prevent the town&#x27;s enemies, presumed to be Royalists, burning it down.

Sudbury and the surrounding area, like much of East Anglia, was a hotbed of Puritan sentiment during much of the 17th century. Sudbury was among the towns called &quot;notorious wasps&#x27; nests of dissent.&quot; During the 1630s, many families departed for the Massachusetts Bay Colony as part of the wave of emigration that occurred during the Great Migration.

In 1706, the River Stour Navigation Act 1705 (4 &amp; 5 Ann. c. 2) was passed in Parliament, and work was undertaken to make the river navigable all the way from Manningtree.

By the 18th century, the fees charged to become a freeman, with voting rights, were exorbitant and the borough of Sudbury, along with 177 other English towns, was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.

During the 18th century, Sudbury became famous for its local artists. John Constable painted in the area, especially the River Stour. Painter Thomas Gainsborough was born in Sudbury in 1727, and was educated at Sudbury Grammar School. His birthplace, now named Gainsborough&#x27;s House, is a museum to his work and is open to the public. It houses many valuable pictures and some of his family possessions. A statue of Gainsborough was unveiled in the town centre outside St Peter&#x27;s Church on Market Hill in 1913.

===Victorian times to 1960s===
The Reform Act 1832 (2 &amp; 3 Will. 4. c. 45) saw the villages of Ballingdon and Brundon appended to the town. In the 1841 general election Sudbury became the first place in the UK to elect a member of an ethnic minority to parliament, with David Ochterlony Dyce Sombre, the son of an Indian queen, winning the seat. However, he was not allowed to take his place in parliament as he was subsequently declared insane.

A new workhouse was built in 1836 off Walnut Tree Lane, close to St Gregory&#x27;s church. From 1946, with the foundation of the National Health Service, it became the local cottage hospital.

Sudbury&#x27;s Catholic Church, Our Lady Immaculate and St. John the Evangelist, was designed by Leonard Stokes and erected in 1893. The shrine of Our Lady of Sudbury sits within its nave.

During the Second World War an American squadron of B-24 Liberator bombers of the 834th Squadron (H), 486th Bomb Group (H), 8th Air Force was based at RAF Sudbury. This squadron performed many important bombing and photographic missions during the war, but is perhaps best known as the &quot;Zodiac Squadron&quot;, as its bombers were decorated with colourful images of the twelve signs of the zodiac painted by a professional artist named Phil Brinkman, who was taken into the squadron by its commander, Capt. Howell, specifically for the purpose of painting the bombers. 
Now most of the airfield buildings have been demolished, including the control tower. Sections of perimeter track, aircraft hard stand areas, and two narrow crossing lengths of former runways provide footpaths between Chilton, Newmans Green and Great Waldingfield. A number of pillboxes were constructed along the river and by Ballingdon Bridge, many of which are extant.

The Corn Exchange became the local public library after a successful campaign in the mid-1960s by the Corn Exchange Preservation Association to save it.

==Geography==

==Governance==

In 1892 Sudbury became a municipal borough which became part of the administrative county of West Suffolk in 1889, with its headquarters at Sudbury Town Hall, the district contained the parishes of Sudbury and Ballingdon and until 1935 Sudbury St Bartholomew. In the local government reorganisation of 1974 the district was abolished to form Babergh, in the non-metropolitan county of Suffolk. A successor parish was formed covering the same area as the former district. Being an urban area the parish council and its chair are known as the &#x27;Town Council&#x27; and &#x27;Town Mayor&#x27; respectively.

From 1559 until 1844 the parliamentary constituency of Sudbury returned two Members of Parliament, before it was disenfranchised for corruption. The Sudbury election of 1835, which Charles Dickens reported for the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot;, is thought by many experts to be the inspiration for the famous Eatanswill election in his novel &quot;Pickwick Papers&quot;. In the previous year&#x27;s by-election a dead heat of 263 votes each was recorded for the two candidates, Edward Barnes and J. Bagshaw. The mayor of Sudbury gave a casting vote to Barnes despite having already voted, and the decision led to serious riots in the town. A county constituency of the same name was established by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 for the 1885 general election, electing one MP by the first past the post voting system. It was abolished for the 1950 general election when it was merged with the Woodbridge constituency to form Sudbury and Woodbridge. In 1983 this constituency was abolished, and Sudbury formed part of the new South Suffolk constituency. The current MP is James Cartlidge (Conservative Party).

==Schools==
The town&#x27;s only secondary school is Ormiston Sudbury Academy. The school was formed, as Sudbury Upper School, in 1972 from an amalgamation of Sudbury Grammar School, the High School for Girls and the Secondary Modern School, following the introduction of comprehensive education. There are several primary schools, including Tudor CEVC Primary School, St. Gregory CEVCP, St Joseph&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary School and Woodhall Primary School. Salters Hall School which was partly housed in the town&#x27;s fifteenth century building of the same name, was closed in 1995.

==Media==
Television signals are received from the nearby Sudbury TV transmitter situated south east of the town. 

The town is served by both BBC Radio Suffolk and BBC Essex. Other radio stations are Heart East, Greatest Hits Radio East, Nation Radio Suffolk, and Karisco Radio, a community based station. 

Sudbury is served by a daily newspaper, the &quot;East Anglian Daily Times&quot;, owned by the Archant group. There are also two weekly newspapers, both published on a Thursday. The &quot;Sudbury Mercury&quot;, again owned by Archant, is delivered free to households, and the &quot;Suffolk Free Press&quot;, owned by Iliffe Media, is sold in shops around south Suffolk and north Essex.

==Sports==
The town&#x27;s main football club, A.F.C. Sudbury, was formed on 1 June 1999 by the amalgamation of two existing clubs, Sudbury Town (founded 1885) and Sudbury Wanderers (founded 1958). Three times FA Vase finalists, they are currently members of the Isthmian League Premier Division.
The local rugby club, Sudbury R.F.C. have previously played as high as National 3 in English rugby, but are currently in the London 2 North East. The club&#x27;s ground is in neighbouring village, Great Cornard. The town&#x27;s oldest sports club is Sudbury Cricket Club, founded in 1787, who currently play in the East Anglian Premier League.

The Kingfisher Leisure Centre, next to the railway station, has a 25 m swimming pool, sauna, fitness centre and a soft play area for children. It is home to Sudbury Storms Swimming Club.

Rowing in the town is held at the Sudbury Rowing Club (formerly the Stour Boat Club) and was founded in 1869 and has held a regatta in the town every year since, except during the world wars. It has a boathouse and clubhouse in Quay Lane and rows on a 1500 m stretch of the Stour by Friars Meadow.

Other sporting groups include a canoeing club, a hapkido club, a running club and a boxing club.

==Culture==

Once a busy and important river port the last industrial building on the riverside in Sudbury has been converted into the town&#x27;s Quay Theatre. The River Stour Trust, formed in 1968, has its headquarters in Sudbury, and a purpose built visitor centre located at Cornard Lock. The trust operates electric-powered boats from the Granary in Quay Lane, to Great Henny, a few miles downstream. Each September, the stretch of the River Stour hosts hundreds of canoe and small boat enthusiasts in a weekend event called &quot;Sudbury to the Sea&quot;, which finishes at Cattawade.

St Peter&#x27;s Church, Sudbury a former church crowning the top of the Market Hill in the centre of Sudbury is now used as a cultural venue for live music and other performances, art exhibitions, and markets. St Peter&#x27;s is currently in the delivery phase of a major regeneration project to conserve and refurbish the building, led by The Churches Conservation Trust.

Valley Walk cycle route and footpath, starts at the Sudbury water meadows and continues along the disused railway track, finishing close to Long Melford Country Park, and then connects to Melford Walk.

Commencing in 2006 the town has hosted the charity fundraising pop music festival, Leestock.

Children&#x27;s author Dodie Smith lived near to Sudbury, and part of her famous novel &quot;The Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;, which inspired the Disney film &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;, takes place in the town including St Peter&#x27;s Church.&quot;Just before midnight they came to the market town of Sudbury. Pongo paused as they crossed the bridge over the River Stour. &quot;Here we enter Suffolk&quot; he said, triumphantly. They ran on through the quiet streets of old houses and into the market square. They had hoped they might meet some dog and hear if any news of the puppies had come at the Twilight Barking, but not so much as a cat was stirring. While they were drinking at the fountain, church clocks began to strike midnight.&quot;

== Transport ==
By road, Sudbury is served by the A131 which runs from near Little Waltham, north of Chelmsford in Essex, and the A134 which runs from Colchester in Essex, through Bury St Edmunds, past Thetford in Norfolk to its west, before merging with the A10 south of King&#x27;s Lynn. There is a taxi rank for Hackney carriages at Old Market Place. The bus station on Hamilton Road in the town centre provides services to neighbouring places, operated by Hedingham &amp; Chambers and other operators.

The railway arrived in Sudbury in 1847 when Sudbury railway station was built on the Stour Valley Railway. The town escaped the Beeching Axe of the 1960s and maintained its rail link with London, although many villages further up the river lost their railway stations. Sudbury railway station now forms the terminus of the branch line which is marketed as the Gainsborough Line, with stops at Bures and Chappel and Wakes Colne railway stations, terminating at Marks Tey railway station. This junction on the Great Eastern Main Line provides connections to London, where trains terminate at Liverpool Street station.

The town was formerly a port; from 1705, horse-drawn lighters transported grain to the numerous water-mills, locally made bricks, coal and even coconuts used for mat-making in Sudbury and Long Melford. Cargos, such as hay and straw, were transhipped in the River Stour estuary at Mistley into Thames barges for transport to London for the horses; they brought back horse-manure for the wheat and barley fields that lie on both sides of the river. During the Great War of 1914–18, and fearing German invasion, the remaining fourteen Stour Lighters were scuttled in Ballingdon Cut. One of these was raised and completely rebuilt by the Pioneer Trust in Brightlingsea. It was delivered, fitted with electric propulsion, to the River Stour Trust in 2012.

==International links==
The Canadian city of Greater Sudbury, Ontario (formerly known as Sudbury and still referred to as Sudbury in everyday usage) was named after Sudbury, becoming a settlement in 1883 following the discovery of rich nickel and copper ores there during the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The superintendent of the railway construction project James Worthington was married to Caroline Hitchcock, a woman who had been born in Sudbury, Suffolk, and the name was chosen to honour her.

Sudbury has two namesakes in the New England region of the United States: Sudbury, Massachusetts, and Sudbury, Vermont.

<text>A scherzo (, , ; plural scherzos or scherzi), in western classical music, is a short composition – sometimes a movement from a larger work such as a symphony or a sonata. The precise definition has varied over the years, but scherzo often refers to a movement that replaces the minuet as the third movement in a four-movement work, such as a symphony, sonata, or string quartet. The term can also refer to a fast-moving humorous composition that may or may not be part of a larger work.

==Origins==
The Italian word &quot;scherzo&quot; means &quot;joke&quot; or &quot;jest.&quot; More rarely, the similar-meaning word &quot;badinerie&quot; (also spelled &quot;battinerie&quot;; from French, &quot;jesting&quot;) has been used. Sometimes the word &quot;scherzando&quot; (&quot;joking&quot;) is used in musical notation to indicate that a passage should be executed in a playful manner.
An early use of the word &quot;scherzo&quot; in music is in light-hearted madrigals of the early baroque period, which were often called &quot;scherzi musicali&quot;, for example:
* Claudio Monteverdi wrote two sets of works with this title, in 1607 and in 1632.
* Antonio Brunelli wrote &quot;Scherzi, Arie, Canzonette e Madrigale&quot; for voices and instruments in 1616.
* Johann Baptist Schenk wrote &quot;Scherzi musicale&quot; (fourteen suites for gamba and continuo).

Later, composers applied the term &quot;scherzo&quot; (plural scherzos or scherzi) and sometimes &quot;badinerie&quot; to certain instrumental works in fast tempos in duple meter time signature, for example:
* The scherzo of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Partita No. 3 for keyboard.

* The best-known &quot;Badinerie&quot; is the final movement of Bach&#x27;s Orchestral Suite No. 2 in B minor. 
* Badineries in French &quot;ouvertures&quot; by Christoph Graupner and Georg Philipp Telemann.

The scherzo, as most commonly known today, developed from the minuet and trio, and gradually came to replace it as the third (sometimes second) movement in symphonies, string quartets, sonatas, and similar works. It traditionally retains the triple meter time signature and ternary form of the minuet, but is considerably quicker. It is often, but not always, of a light-hearted nature.

The main features include a 6 - 8 bar melody with one beat per bar feel.

==Form==
The scherzo itself is a rounded binary form, but, like the minuet, is usually played with the accompanying trio followed by a repeat of the scherzo, creating the ABA or ternary form. This is sometimes done twice or more (ABABA). The &quot;B&quot; theme is a trio, a contrasting section not necessarily for only three instruments, as was often the case with the second minuet of classical suites (the first Brandenburg Concerto has a famous example). In some cases the scherzo is in sonata form, for example the third movement of Brahms&#x27;s Fourth Symphony in E Minor.

==Appearance/examples in compositions==
Scherzos occasionally differ from this traditional structure in various ways.
* Some examples are not in the customary triple meter—for example, the scherzo of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Fourth Symphony, which is in time; or the trio section of the scherzo from his Second Symphony which is in time. Another example is Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 18. This example is also unusual in being written in orthodox sonata form rather than the usual ternary form for such a movement, and thus it lacks a trio section. This sonata is also unusual in that the scherzo is followed by a minuet and trio movement—whereas most sonatas have either a scherzo movement or a minuet movement, but not both. Some analysts have attempted to account for these irregularities by analyzing the scherzo as the sonata&#x27;s slow movement, which is rather fast. That would keep the traditional structure for a four-movement sonata that Beethoven usually followed, especially in the first half of his piano sonatas.
* Joseph Haydn wrote minuets that are close to scherzi in tone — but it was Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert who first used scherzi widely, with Beethoven in particular turning the polite rhythm of the minuet into a much more intense – and sometimes even savage – dance. Although in 1781, Haydn substituted menuets for scherzi in all of his 6 String Quartets, Op. 33.

The scherzo remained a standard movement in the symphony and related forms through the 19th century and beyond. Composers also began to write scherzi as pieces in themselves, stretching the boundaries of the form.
* The first three of Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s four well-known scherzos for the piano are especially dark, with an intense energy, and hardly come off as jokes. Robert Schumann remarked of them, &quot;How is &#x27;gravity&#x27; to clothe itself if &#x27;jest&#x27; goes about in dark veils?&quot; Chopin&#x27;s four scherzos are written as single movements, on an unprecedented large scale going beyond the previous Beethovenian model of classical multi-movement works.
* In a letter, Brahms referred to the scherzo from his Second Piano Concerto as a &quot;little wisp of a scherzo&quot;, in one of his typically sarcastic remarks, as it is a heavyweight movement.
* Other examples; the second movement of Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony No. 10, the second (sometimes third) movement of Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 6, Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s composition for &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; between act 1 and 2, and in several of Bruckner&#x27;s symphonies.
In present-day compositions, the scherzo has also made appearances.
* Australian composer Julian Cochran wrote extensively for the form, with four scherzi for piano and two grand scherzi for symphony orchestra.
* The soundtrack release of John Williams&#x27; film score for &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; (2015) includes a track titled &quot;Scherzo for X-Wings&quot; which follows the typical scherzo rounded binary form and presents itself in a time. Williams had previously composed &quot;Scherzo for Motorcycle and Orchestra&quot; for the film score of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; (1989) and in 1985 the &quot;Scherzo for Today&quot; for NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Today Show&quot;.

<text>King&#x27;s Lynn, known until 1537 as Bishop&#x27;s Lynn and colloquially as Lynn, is a port and market town in the borough of King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk in the county of Norfolk, England. It is north-east of Peterborough, north-north-east of Cambridge and west of Norwich.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The etymology of King&#x27;s Lynn is uncertain. The name &quot;Lynn&quot; may signify a body of water near the town – the Welsh word means a lake; but the name is plausibly of Anglo-Saxon origin, from &quot;lean&quot; meaning a tenure in fee or farm. As the 1086 Domesday Book mentions saltings at Lena (Lynn), an area of partitioned pools may have existed there at the time. Other places with Lynn in the name include Dublin, Ireland, with An Dubh Linn meaning “the Black Pool.” The presence of salt, which was relatively rare and expensive in the early medieval period, may have added to the interest of Herbert de Losinga and other prominent Normans in the modest parish.

The town was named &quot;Len &quot; (Bishop&#x27;s Lynn) while under the temporal and spiritual jurisdiction of the Bishop of Norwich, but in the reign of Henry VIII it was surrendered to the crown and took the name &quot;Lenne &quot; or King&#x27;s Lynn. The Domesday Book records it as &quot;Lun&quot; and &quot;Lenn&quot;, and ascribes it to the Bishop of Elmham and the Archbishop of Canterbury.

The town is generally known locally as &quot;Lynn&quot;.

The city of Lynn, Massachusetts, north of Boston, was named in 1637 in honour of its first official minister of religion, Reverend Samuel Whiting Sr, who arrived there from Lynn, Norfolk.

===Middle Ages===
Lynn originated on a constricted site south of where the River Great Ouse now discharges into the Wash. Development began in the early 10th century, but the place was not recorded until the early 11th century. Until the early 13th century, the Great Ouse emptied via the Wellstream at Wisbech. After its redirection, Lynn and its port gained significance and prosperity.

In 1101, Bishop Herbert de Losinga of Thetford began to build the first medieval town between the rivers Purfleet to the north and Mill Fleet to the south. He commissioned St Margaret&#x27;s Church and authorised a market to be held on Saturday. Trade built up along the waterways that stretched inland; the town expanded between the two rivers.

Lynn&#x27;s 12th-century Jewish community was exterminated in the widespread massacres of 1189.

During the 14th century, Lynn ranked as England&#x27;s most important port. It was seen to be as vital to England in the Middle Ages as Liverpool was during the Industrial Revolution. Sea trade with Europe was dominated by the Hanseatic League of ports; the trade and the rise of England&#x27;s western ports began only in the 17th century. The Trinity Guildhall was rebuilt in 1421 after a fire. Walls entered by the South Gate and East Gate were erected to protect the town. It retains two former Hanseatic League warehouses: Hanse House of 1475 and Marriott&#x27;s Warehouse, in use between the 15th and 17th centuries. These are the only remaining buildings of the Hanseatic League in England. The town was designated a Royal Port by King John.

===Modern===

In the first decade of the 16th century, Thoresby College was built in Lynn by Thomas Thoresby to house priests of the Guild of The Holy Trinity. It had been incorporated in 1453 under a petition of its alderman, chaplain, four brethren and four sisters, who were licensed to found a chantry of chaplains for the altar of Holy Trinity in Wisbech. Lands were granted in mortmain. Lynn acquired a mayor and corporation in 1524. In 1537 the king took over the town from the bishop. In the same century the town&#x27;s two annual fairs were reduced to one. In 1534 a grammar school was founded; four years later Henry VIII closed the Benedictine priory and the three friaries.

A piped water supply was created in the 16th century, although many could not afford to connect to the elm pipes carrying water under the streets. Lynn suffered from outbreaks of plague, notably in 1516, 1587, 1597, 1636 and finally in 1665. Fire was another hazard – in 1572 thatched roofs were banned to reduce the risk. In the English Civil War, King&#x27;s Lynn supported Parliament, but in August 1643 it was in Royalist hands. It changed sides again after Parliament sent an army and the town was besieged for three weeks. Valentine Walton brother-in-law of Oliver Cromwell was appointed governor.

A heart carved on the wall of the Tuesday Market Place supposedly marks the burning of an alleged witch, Margaret Read, in 1590. It is said that as she was burning her heart burst from her body and struck the wall. Other sources put forward Mary Smith, hanged in 1616, as the witch.
In 1683, the architect Henry Bell, once the town&#x27;s mayor, designed the Custom House. He also designed the &quot;Duke&#x27;s Head Inn&quot;, North Runcton Church and Stanhoe Hall, having gained ideas while on travel in Europe as a young man.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the town&#x27;s main export was grain. Lynn was no longer a major international port, but iron and timber were imported. King&#x27;s Lynn suffered from the discovery of the Americas, which benefited ports on the west coast of England. It was also affected by the growth of London.

In the late 17th century, imports of wine from Spain, Portugal and France boomed, and there was still much coastal trade. It was cheaper to transport goods by water than by road at the time. Large amounts of coal arrived from the north-east of England.

The Fens began to be drained in the mid–17th century and the land turned to farming, allowing vast amounts of produce to be sent to London&#x27;s growing market. Meanwhile, King&#x27;s Lynn was still a major fishing port. Greenland Fishery House in Bridge Street was built in 1605. By the late 17th century shipbuilding and glass-making had also developed.

In the early 18th century, Daniel Defoe called the town &quot;beautiful, well built and well situated&quot;. Shipbuilding thrived, as did associated trades such as sail-making and rope-making. Glass-making prospered; brewing was another important industry. The Norwich company of comedians had been visiting since the 1750s, in 1766 a permanent theatre was created. A new playhouse was built in 1805. The first bank in King&#x27;s Lynn opened in 1784.

A fearsome example of penal brutality occurred on 28 September 1708, when a seven-year-old boy, Michael Hammond, and his 11-year-old sister Ann were convicted of stealing a loaf of bread and sentenced to hanging. Their public executions took place near the South Gates. The Member of Parliament at the time was Sir Robert Walpole, generally regarded as the first Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
The town&#x27;s decline from the late 17th century was reversed by the arrival of the railways in 1847, mainly by the Great Eastern Railway, later the London and North Eastern Railway, running to Hunstanton, Dereham and Cambridge. The town was also served by the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway (M&amp;GN), with offices at Austin Street and a station at South Lynn (now dismantled), which was also its operational control centre. It relocated to Melton Constable. The M&amp;GN lines across Norfolk closed to passengers in February 1959.

The town&#x27;s amenities continued to improve in the 20th century. A museum opened in 1904 and a public library in 1905. The first cinema, the Majestic, officially opened on 23 May 1928. (The year is marked in a stained-glass window on the front of the building.) The town council began a programme of regeneration in the 1930s.

During the First World War, King&#x27;s Lynn was one of the UK&#x27;s first towns to suffer aerial bombing, on the night of 19 January 1915 by a naval Zeppelin, L4 (LZ 27), commanded by Captain Lieutenant Magnus von Platen-Hallermund. Eleven bombs were dropped, both incendiary and high explosive, doing much damage, killing two people in Bentinck Street and injuring several more. When the Second World War began in 1939, it was assumed that King&#x27;s Lynn would be safe from bombing and many evacuees were sent from London, but the town suffered several raids.

The local breweries had closed by the 1950s, but new industries included food canning in the 1930s and soup-making in the 1950s. In the 1960s, the council sought to encourage development by adding an industrial estate at Hardwick.

In 1962, King&#x27;s Lynn was classed as an overflow town for London. The population grew and estates were built at Woottons and Gaywood. The town centre was redeveloped in the 1960s and many earlier buildings knocked down. Lynnsport, a sports centre, opened in 1982. The Corn Exchange in Tuesday Market Place became a theatre in 1996.

===Recent changes===

Since 2004, work has been under way to regenerate the town under a multi-million-pound scheme. The 1960s Vancouver Shopping Centre (now the Vancouver Quarter) was refurbished in 2005 under the scheme, but was expected to last only 25 years, according to the construction firm, even with a planned extension. An award-winning £6 million multi-storey car park was built.

To the south of the town, residential housing appeared on a large area of brownfield land. Plans for another housing estate alongside the River Nar were opposed locally and halted by the economic situation. There is also a business park, parkland, a school, shops and a new relief road in a £300 million-plus scheme.

In 2006, King&#x27;s Lynn became the United Kingdom&#x27;s first member of The Hanse (&quot;Die Hanse&quot;), a network of towns across Europe that belonged historically to the Hanseatic League. The league was an influential medieval trading association of merchant towns around the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, which contributed to Lynn&#x27;s development.
The Borough Council commissioned and accepted a 2008 report by DTZ that dubbed King&#x27;s Lynn&#x27;s workforce as &quot;low-value&quot; with a &quot;low skills base&quot; and the town as having a &quot;poor lifestyle offer&quot;. The quality of services and amenities was &quot;unattractive to higher-value inward investors and professional employees with higher disposable incomes&quot;. Average earnings were well below regional and national levels, and many jobs in tourism, leisure and hotels were subject to seasonal fluctuations and likewise poorly paid. Education and workforce skills were described as below the national average. The borough ranked 150th out of 354 for social deprivation.

In 2009, a proposal was made for the Campbell&#x27;s Meadow factory site to be redeveloped as a employment and business park. In June 2011 Tesco gained a permit for a superstore. On 8 June 2010, it unveiled regeneration plans that would cost £32 million and were billed to bring 900 new jobs. Tesco pledged £4 million of improvements in other areas of the town. While it planned to spend £1.6 million widening Hardwick Road, the Sainsbury&#x27;s bid was preferred by the Council as offering the town more benefits.
Sainsbury&#x27;s £40 million plans for a superstore opposite Tesco on the Pinguin Foods site yielded an estimated 300 jobs. This was the key to securing the future of Pinguin Foods in King&#x27;s Lynn. Pinguin Foods released of its site to accommodate the proposed store. Mortson Assets&#x27; and Sainsbury&#x27;s plan included a link road between Scania Way and Queen Elizabeth Way to improve access and allow the industrial estate to attract new employers, while Sainsbury&#x27;s maintains its store in the town centre. It has pledged £1.75 million for highways improvements and a further £7 million to invest in the Pinguin Foods factory.

At 8 am on 15 January 2012, the landmark Campbell&#x27;s Tower was demolished – competition winner Sarah Griffiths pulled the switch. Her father, Mick Locke, had died in 1995 aged 52 after being scalded by steam at the factory. It was Campbell&#x27;s first UK factory when it opened in the 1950s. At its peak in the early 1990s it employed over 700.

A fire station was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in February 2015.

==Governance==
King&#x27;s Lynn became a municipal borough in 1883. The present Borough of King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk was an amalgamation of the Borough of King&#x27;s Lynn, the urban districts of Downham Market and Hunstanton, and the rural districts of Docking, Downham, Freebridge Lynn, and Marshland.

===Heraldry===

The shield in the coat of arms of King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk is that of the ancient Borough of Lynn, recorded at the College of Arms in 1563. It shows the legend of Margaret of Antioch, who has appeared on Lynn shields since the 13th century, and to whom the parish church is dedicated.
The per chevron division and addition of a bordure serve to distinguish the shield from its predecessor, while retaining its medieval simplicity. The bordure also suggests the wider bounds of the new authority, with the seven parts symbolising the seven amalgamated authorities. The gull on the crest is a maritime reference. It has appeared as a supporter in some representations, but officially stands on a bollard to make it distinctive. It supports a crown or coronet like a King&#x27;s Lynn supporter and a lion from the crest of Downham Market. 
The coronet refers to the Borough&#x27;s royal connections. The cross held by the gull is an extension of the two in the shield, and the cross in the coat of arms of Freebridge Lynn Rural District.

The supporters are based on the crest of the Hunstanton Urban District Council. The lion is a variation of the lions, or leopards, in the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom and its fish tail suggests the borough&#x27;s links with the sea. The fish–lion is also the central feature in the borough&#x27;s badge, but here it is surrounded by a garland of oak leaves as a reference to the rural nature of much of the district. Oak leaves also appear in the coronet in the crest of the former Downham Market Urban District Council.

===Twinning===
King&#x27;s Lynn is twinned with: 
* Emmerich am Rhein, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany
* Sandringham, Victoria, Australia

* Mladá Boleslav, Central Bohemian Region, Czechia

==Geography==
===Topography===

King&#x27;s Lynn is the northernmost settlement on the River Great Ouse, lying north of London and west of Norwich. The town lies about south of the Wash, a fourfold estuary subject to dangerous tides and shifting sandbanks, on the north-west margin of East Anglia. King&#x27;s Lynn has an area of .

The Great Ouse at Lynn is about wide and the outfall for much of the Fens&#x27; drainage system. The much smaller Gaywood River also flows through the town, joining the Great Ouse at the southern end of South Quay, close to the town centre. A small section known as West Lynn lies on the west bank, linked to the town centre by one of the oldest ferries in the country. Other districts of King&#x27;s Lynn include the town centre, North Lynn, South Lynn, and Gaywood.

===Climate===
King&#x27;s Lynn has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb). The annual mean daytime temperature is around . January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between . July and August are the warmest, with mean daily maximum temperatures of some .

There are two Met Office weather stations close to King&#x27;s Lynn: Terrington St Clement, about to the west and RAF Marham, about to the south-east.

The absolute maximum temperature at Terrington stands at recorded in August 2003, though in a more average year the warmest day will only reach , with 13.8 days in total attaining a temperature of or more. Typically all these figures are marginally lower than those for the southern half of the Fens due to the presence of onshore sea breezes, and occasional haar (cold sea fog), especially in early summer and late spring. However, with a strong enough offshore breeze, the area can be notably warm. Terrington (along with Cambridge Botanical Gardens) achieved the national highest temperature of 2007, 

The absolute minimum at Terrington is , set in January 1979. A total of 41.6 nights will report an air frost at Terrington and 51.9 nights at Marham.

Annual rainfall totals at Marham, and at Terrington, with 1 mm or more falling on 115 and 113 days, respectively. All averages refer to the 30-year observation period 1971–2000.

===Parks===
The largest of the town&#x27;s several public parks are the Walks, a historic 17-hectare urban park in the centre of King&#x27;s Lynn. They are the only town walk in Norfolk to survive from the 18th century. The Heritage Lottery Fund donated £4.3 million towards restoring them and adding modern amenities. They also include the Red Mount, a Grade II-listed 15th-century chapel. In 1998, the Walks were designated by English Heritage as a Grade II national historic park.

The Walks as a whole had a different, earlier origin, conceived of not as a municipal park, as one understands the term today, but as a promenade for citizens, away from the smell, grime and bustle of the town centre. Harding&#x27;s Pits form another public park, to the south of the town. This informal area of open space with large public sculptures was laid out to reflect the town&#x27;s history. Harding&#x27;s Pits are managed by local volunteers under a management firm, which successfully fought off a Borough Council attempts to turn them into an attenuation drain.

==Demography==
In 2007, King&#x27;s Lynn had a population of 42,800. At Norfolk&#x27;s 2007 census, King&#x27;s Lynn, together with West Norfolk, had a population of 143,500, with an average population density of 1.0 persons per hectare. For figures after 2011 see King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk.

==Economy==
King&#x27;s Lynn has always been a centre for fishing and seafood (especially inshore prawns, shrimps and cockles). There have also been glass-making and small-scale engineering works – many fairground and steam engines were built here. It still contains much farm-related industry, including food processing. There are several chemical factories and the town retains a role as an import centre. In general, it is a regional centre for a still sparsely populated part of England.

King&#x27;s Lynn was the fastest growing port in Great Britain in 2008. Department for Transport figures show that through-put increased by 33 per cent.

In 2008, the German Palm Group began to erect one of the world&#x27;s largest paper machines, constructed by &quot;Voith Paper&quot;. With a web speed of up to 2000 metres a minute and a web width of 10.63 metres, it can produce 400,000 tons a year of newsprint paper, based on 100-per-cent recycled paper. The start-up was on 21 August 2009.

The Port of King&#x27;s Lynn has facilities for dry bulk cargo such as cereals and liquid bulk products such as petroleum products for Pace Petroleum. It also handles timber imported from Scandinavia and the Baltics and has handling sheds for steel imports.
King&#x27;s Lynn is the prime retail centre in West Norfolk. The town centre is dominated by budget shops, reflecting the spending power of much of the population. The town centre fulfils a leisure role with entertainment centres, bars and restaurants, and has a range of service functions. It provides about 5,300 retailing jobs.

The town centre has 73,000 sq. m. of retail floor space in 347 shops, which exceeds the comparable centres of Bury St Edmunds and Boston. However, whilst the percentage of floor space in comparison shopping and that occupied by multiple retailers is above the national average, King&#x27;s Lynn offers a more limited range of choice.
Tourism in King&#x27;s Lynn is a minor industry, but it attracts visitors to its historic centre, and as a base for visiting Sandringham House and other country houses in the area. Within the town and across the nearby Fenland are some of the finest historic churches in Britain, built in a period when King&#x27;s Lynn and its hinterland were wealthy from trade and wool.

==Transport==

===Roads===
King&#x27;s Lynn is linked to the cities of Norwich and Peterborough by the A47, to Cambridge by the A10, and to Spalding and the North via the A17. Parts of north and east Norfolk are reached by the A148 and the A149. There is currently a campaign led by Norfolk County Council to dual the A47, due to the area&#x27;s poor road networks and lack of motorways compared to other areas of the country.

===Railway===
King&#x27;s Lynn railway station, terminus of the Fen Line, is the sole railway facility in King&#x27;s Lynn. It provides regular services to Cambridge and London King&#x27;s Cross. South Lynn railway station closed to passengers in 1959, as did Hunstanton in 1969.

West Norfolk Council is still considering ostensibly reopening a railway between King&#x27;s Lynn and Hunstanton. The possibility was proposed at a meeting of the council&#x27;s &quot;Regeneration and Environment Panel&quot; on 29 October 2008, having last been discussed in the 1990s. An environmental case was made for reviving the line to relieve road congestion.

===Buses===
Nearly all Stagecoach services in the area have been withdrawn, leaving most services in King&#x27;s Lynn operated by Lynx or Go To Town (West Norfolk Community Transport Project).

King&#x27;s Lynn is served by the &quot;excel&quot; bus route between Peterborough and Norwich operated by First Eastern Counties. The &quot;Coasthopper&quot; route from King&#x27;s Lynn runs round the Norfolk Coast to Cromer but, since Stagecoach withdrew from Norfolk, the western section has been run by Lynx as &quot;Coastliner&quot; 36 and extended inland from Wells-next-the-Sea to Fakenham. The Wells–Cromer section is run by Sanders Coaches and still known as Coasthopper, but now extends inland to North Walsham.

===South Transport Project===
A £7 million programme to redevelop the infrastructure of the town centre in the 2010s was largely provided by the Community Infrastructure Fund. The department programme is a collection of smaller developments, which are detailed below.

Work on a cycle and bus route between the town centre and South Lynn began in June 2010, at a cost of £850,000. It is 720 metres long, from Morston Drift to Millfleet, with buses in both directions, and features a separate path for pedestrians and bicycles, which coincides with the bus route when crossing the Nar sluice. As part of the development, the Millfleet–St James&#x27; Road junction is being developed.

A contraflow lane for bicycles was proposed, but not built along Norfolk Street from Albert Street to Blackfriars Road. This would have included a development of the Norfolk Road/Railway Road junction to better accommodate buses and bicycles. Similar work was to have taken place at the Norfolk Street–Littleport Street junction, so that buses would not get caught in the town-centre gyratory system.

Bus priority measures have been added to four sets of traffic lights along St James&#x27; Road. These give buses quicker access to the town centre and normalise journey times.

Southgates roundabout has been redeveloped. Many of its approach roads have been widened in the run-up to the junction and the road markings redone in an attempt to improve lane discipline. It is a noted congestion hot spot.

Other small developments are taking place to make junctions more car-friendly.

==Media==
King&#x27;s Lynn has two local newspapers: the twice-weekly &quot;Lynn News&quot;, owned by Iliffe Media, and &quot;Your Local Paper&quot;, a free weekly ( now also owned by Iliffe Media). &quot;KL magazine&quot; is a free lifestyle magazine that promotes the best of west and north Norfolk. It has been published monthly since October 2010 and is distributed to local businesses (now issued bi-monthly).; it also issues special &quot;Food&quot; and &quot;Home Design &amp; Build&quot; editions.

King&#x27;s Lynn is served by BBC Radio Norfolk, Heart East, Greatest Hits Radio (West Norfolk), KL1 Radio, Radio West Norfolk and all national BBC radio stations. The local college has a web-based TV station run by media students, entitled SpringboardTV.com, and holds an awards ceremony at the end of each academic year.

Television services are provided by BBC East, BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, ITV Anglia, and ITV Yorkshire.

==Education==
Three of King&#x27;s Lynn four secondary schools are located in the town: King Edward VII School, the King&#x27;s Lynn Academy and Springwood High School. The fourth, St Clements High School, is in the nearby village of Terrington St Clement. The first is known for its physical education department, King&#x27;s Lynn Academy for its maths and IT specialities, and Springwood for performing arts and drama. The nearest independent school is Wisbech Grammar School in Cambridgeshire.

The town&#x27;s further education college, the College of West Anglia, was founded in 1894 as King&#x27;s Lynn Technical School. In 1973, it was renamed Norfolk College of Arts and Technology, and, in 1998, merged with Cambridgeshire College of Agriculture and Horticulture, which added campuses in Wisbech (now closed) and Milton; it changed the name to the College of West Anglia. It retained this name in April 2006, when it merged with the Isle College in Wisbech.

==Culture==
===St George&#x27;s Guildhall===

The Guild of St George was founded in 1376 and acquired land for the Guildhall of St George in 1406, which was in use by 1428. It offered plays in the Guildhall, the first known being a nativity play in January 1445. This makes it the UK&#x27;s oldest working theatre.

The Guildhall was used for meetings, dinners and performance until 1547, when King Edward VI dissolved the Guilds. It then became the property of Lynn Corporation and known as the Common Town Hall. Research by the University of East Anglia confirms as probable the oral history of King&#x27;s Lynn that William Shakespeare performed in the Guildhall in 1593. This is the only still-working theatre in the world that can credibly claim to have hosted Shakespeare. In 1766, Guildhall shows were so popular that a new interior was built inside the present structure, probably on the earlier footprint. By 1945, the Guildhall was almost derelict and in danger of demolition. It was bought by Alexander Penrose, who gave it to the National Trust in 1951. The Pilgrim Trust, Arts Council and public subscription led to conversion into an Arts Centre. Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother opened it in July 1951 and launched the King&#x27;s Lynn Festival.

Today, the Guildhall is owned by the National Trust and leased to the Borough Council of King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk. Various groups hire the building for a year-round programme of theatre, dance, music, lectures and film; amongst them are Shakespeare&#x27;s Guildhall Trust, King&#x27;s Lynn Festival, King&#x27;s Lynn Community Cinema Club. Shakespeare&#x27;s Guildhall Trust have volunteers who open the theatre to visitors.

===Arts===
Composer Ralph Vaughan Williams visited King&#x27;s Lynn in January 1905 and collected several folk songs from the area.

Ruth, Lady Fermoy, a concert pianist, moved to King&#x27;s Lynn in 1931 as the bride of Lord Edmund Fermoy, who would become the town mayor and local MP. She helped to organise concerts of high-standard professional music.

In 1951, Lady Fermoy complemented the Festival of Britain with a King&#x27;s Lynn Festival of the Arts. She was a friend and lady-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth – later the Queen Mother – who agreed to become the festival patron and, in July 1951, officially opened the restored St George&#x27;s Guildhall. She remained an enthusiastic and active supporter and patron of the festival until her death in March 2002.

The King&#x27;s Lynn Festival remains the premier music and arts festival in West Norfolk. It is primarily known for classical music, but also hosts jazz, choral, folk, opera, dance, films, talks and exhibitions, along with fringe events each year.

The King&#x27;s Lynn Literature Festival, amalgamating the previous annual Poetry and Fiction Festivals, is held over a weekend in September each year, usually in the town hall. The Annual Hanse Festival first took place in 2009.

===Displays===
Storeys of Lynn Museum opened in March 2016, as part of the King&#x27;s Lynn Town Hall complex. Set within the newly-revealed vaulted undercroft of the 15th-century Trinity Guildhall, it presents the town&#x27;s collection in an extensive, nationally significant interactive and multi-media exhibition. True&#x27;s Yard Fisherfolk Museum displays the social history of the North End fishermen, run by volunteers. It includes a cottage and a smokehouse. Since 2013, there has been a local award-winning Military Museum operated by The Bridge for Heroes Charity to raise funds. Lynn Museum, run by Norfolk Museums Service in Market Street, covers the town&#x27;s local history and the Bronze Age timber circle Seahenge.

Festival Too is held in Tuesday Market Place each summer. Performers have included Midge Ure, Deacon Blue, Suzi Quatro, 10cc, Mungo Jerry, the Human League, the Buzzcocks, M People, Atomic Kitten, Kieran Woodcock, S Club and Beverley Knight.

The historic Majestic Cinema in the town centre now has four screens; and there are two further cinema screens in the town&#x27;s Corn Exchange.

King&#x27;s Lynn&#x27;s main venue for concerts, stand-up comedy shows and other live events is the Corn Exchange in Tuesday Market Place. Many smaller venues such as &quot;Bar Red&quot; and &quot;the Wenns&quot; contribute to the local music scene, along with acts from other parts of the country.

===Mart===
In the 16th century, King&#x27;s Lynn&#x27;s Tuesday Market Place hosted two trade fairs that attracted visitors from as far as Italy and Germany. As the importance of such fairs declined, the Mart has become a funfair, reduced to a single fortnight&#x27;s annual event that begins on 14 February (Valentine&#x27;s Day). It is also a memorial to Frederick Savage, who partnered the Showmen&#x27;s Guild of Great Britain to develop new funfair attractions.

===Sport===
The town&#x27;s football club, King&#x27;s Lynn Town, play in the National League North as of the 2024–25 season. It was formed in 2010, after the original King&#x27;s Lynn FC was wound up in December 2009. Its home games are played at The Walks Stadium in Tennyson Road.

King&#x27;s Lynn&#x27;s speedway team, the King&#x27;s Lynn Stars, races at the Adrian Flux Arena in Saddlebow Road. The track has been run since 1965 on an open licence. It hosted Speedway-type events in the 1950s.

One of the town&#x27;s basketball clubs, King&#x27;s Lynn Fury, previously played in the National League out of Lynnsport and represented the town in national competitions from 2004 to 2017. Lynn Nets, formed in 2008, also runs a programme in local competitions.

The historic hockey team The Pelicans, dating from 1920, currently plays at Lynnsport, having been based in nearby North Runcton until 1996.

==Notable people==

==Location==
==In popular culture==
Ruth Galloway, fictional heroine of Elly Griffiths&#x27; novels, is a forensic anthropologist living in a cottage near King&#x27;s Lynn and teaching at the fictional University of North Norfolk.

Peter Grainger&#x27;s DC Smith Investigation series of detective novels is set in &quot;Kings Lake&quot;, a thinly-disguised King&#x27;s Lynn.

The fictional comedy character Alan Partridge was born in Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King&#x27;s Lynn. The character itself, played by Steve Coogan, grew up in Norwich and frequently makes references to Norfolk.

==Media appearances==
King&#x27;s Lynn and surroundings have since the early 20th century been popular with film and TV producers. Their architecture and landscape often allow them to stand in for other parts of the world, especially the Netherlands and France. The town appeared as the Netherlands in &quot;The Silver Fleet&quot; (1943) and &quot;One of Our Aircraft Is Missing&quot; (1942), as Germany in &quot;Operation Crossbow&quot; in 1965, and as France in &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot;, the long-running BBC comedy.

The town served as an earlier Dutch New York in the 1985 feature film &quot;Revolution&quot;. The BBC series &quot;Lovejoy&quot; also used the town, as did the Anglia Television series &quot;Tales Of The Unexpected&quot; and the Granada series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, starring Jeremy Brett in the title role.

In the early 2000s, the BBC used the town bus station, local roads and the nearby Royal estate of Sandringham in the comedy drama series &quot;Grass&quot;, featuring Simon Day. It has, in recent times, appeared many times on programmes such as the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Antiques Road Trip&quot;, &quot;Flog It!&quot;, and a BBC Four documentary &quot;The Last Journey of the Magna Carta King&quot;, following the trail of John, King of England and how he lost his treasure in the Wash.

<doc id="99675" wikidata="Q5147649" url="?curid=99675" title="Collège du Sacré-Cœur (Egypt)">
<text>Collège du Sacré-Cœur is a Roman Catholic French-language school located in Cairo, Egypt. The school hosts two campuses the original one in Ghamra founded in 1904 and a second campus founded in 1911 on Beirut street at Heliopolis. Despite being labelled a collège, the school covers all years from nursey through secondary and is a member of The Network of Sacred Heart Schools.

==History==
The Collège was founded in 1904 under the name Pensionnat du Sacré-Cœur (Sacred Heart boarding school). A second school was added at the urging of Ismail Sidky as a way to provide French-language instruction to the newly constructed city of Heliopolis in 1911. The school&#x27;s building was built in 1900&#x27;s with the distinct Heliopolis style modeled after the orientalist designs of Édouard Empain. The school&#x27;s early classes had a small number of girls most of whom where European but overtime grew rapidly and would come to primarily consist of Egyptian citizens.

During the First World War the school acted as a refuge for those fleeing under both the Ottoman and German empires. The school also served as the chapel and camp for Australians while students helped to aid those wounded at the hospital set up at the Heliopolis Palace Hotel. Similarly, during the Second World War, the school housed many refugees freeing from Nazi-occupied France.

Following the revolution of 1952, the school underwent many changes. The structure of the school would no longer be a Catholic boarding school instead focusing on day classes and opening up its doors to non-Christians. Coinciding with this was a shift from a purely French educational system to one focused on the French-language and a new &quot;franco-egyptian&quot; curriculum.

In 2005, the school was certified by the Institut Français to include courses to prepare students for the French Baccalauréat but does not offer the exam itself.

==Architecture==
The school&#x27;s campus in Heliopolis has been noted for its distinct architecture in a neo-Mamluk style. It was in part designed by Édouard Empain as a part of his constructed city. The school would become a symbol of the neighborhood in Cairo and was even featured in a graphic novel and art installation in Dubai

<text>Gap is a census-designated place (CDP) and unincorporated community in Salisbury Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, United States, with a ZIP code of 17527. The population was 1,931 at the 2010 census. U.S. Route 30 passes through the town, which is also the terminus for four Pennsylvania highways: 772, 741, 897, and the heavily used 41, which leads toward Wilmington, Delaware.

Gap lies approximately east of Lancaster and west of Philadelphia.

==History==
Gap was named for its location at a low pass through Mine Ridge. Gap has a history which can be dated as far back as William Penn&#x27;s first visits to the area. Isaac Taylor erected the first house in what would become Gap in 1747. The area around Gap had a copper mine and what at the time were the only nickel mines in the United States.

From 1792, the Rising Sun Tavern stood on the Philadelphia–Lancaster Pike (which is now U.S. Route 30) and had a small village with blacksmith shop. Most of the buildings stood until circa 2020–2021, when they were removed for redevelopment; the site now contains a large convenience store and gas station. Although there was interest among locals to preserve the buildings, the real estate was valuable commercial frontage and funding for preservation was not available.

A stretch of railroad line was laid through the pass in the 19th century. Today the same railroad right-of-way carries Amtrak trains on the Keystone service.

In the mid-19th century there was a group of men known as &quot;The Gap Gang&quot;. They would engage in raids and robberies of citizens traveling the Lancaster Philadelphia Turnpike. They were notorious for kidnapping free blacks and escaped slaves and selling them to slave traders in Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia. The Gap Gang were most noted for their involvement in the Christiana Riot.

Nearby to the west, and traditionally closely associated with Gap, is White Chimneys, a country estate that began as a Church Dutch family farm much like any other in the area but eventually became known for wealth because it was the home of the Slaymaker family, who owned the Slaymaker Lock Company of Lancaster City.

==Geography==
Gap is in eastern Lancaster County, in the southern part of Salisbury Township. A small portion of the community extends south into Sadsbury Township. The gap for which the community is named is at an elevation of above sea level, between Mine Ridge to the west and Gap Hill to the east, both ridges rising to about above sea level. The community occupies the center of the gap and extends northward downslope into Salisbury Township.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.11%, are water. The gap separates the watersheds of two tributaries of the Susquehanna River. To the north, streams flow to Pequea Creek, which flows west to the Susquehanna at Pequea. To the south, water flows to the East Branch of Octoraro Creek, reaching the Susquehanna just south of Conowingo Dam in Maryland.

==Roads==
U.S. Route 30 (the Lincoln Highway) passes through Gap, leading west to Lancaster and east to Coatesville and eventually Philadelphia.

Pennsylvania Route 41 begins in Gap at US 30 and leads southeast to the Wilmington, Delaware, area. It is a major route for commercial trucks.

Pennsylvania Route 772 starts four blocks west of the intersection of PA 41 and US 30. It leads northwest to Lititz, passing through Intercourse, Leola, Brownstown, and Rothsville along the way.

In August 2016, a $10,000,000 realignment project was completed, separating eastbound and westbound traffic on US Route 30 between PA Route 41 and just west of PA Route 772. This has not eliminated the previous congestion problems that often plagued that area. Only complicating travel and adding to congestion and even more serious accidents. This is why PennDOT is reviewing and implementing additional projects to improve congestion both east and west of the Gap Bypass on or before the year 2045.

Pennsylvania Route 897 starts in Gap one block east of Route 41 at US 30. It leads north to Blue Ball, passing over Welsh Mountain along the way.

Pennsylvania Route 741 starts at the intersection of PA 41 and Bridge Street. The route leads west to Millersville.

The Gap Fire Co. is located along Pequea Avenue, one block west of PA 41. The fire company was originally located atop Pequea Avenue by their water refilling area. The original fire house was renovated into a home that is leased out. A new facility was built to house all of the rescue trucks. Up the street another block is a historic site of Gap&#x27;s only radio station WNUZ, then WLRI.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 3,320 people, 1,505 households, and 714 families residing in the CDP. The racial makeup of the CDP was 95% White, 3% Black or African American, 0.06% Native American, 1.06% Asian, 0.12% Pacific Islander, 0.12% from other races, and 0.31% from two or more races. 1% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 714 households, out of which 38.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 68.7% were married couples living together, 7.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 19.6% were non-families. 16.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.82 and the average family size was 3.14.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 29.4% under the age of 18, 7.1% from 18 to 24, 29.7% from 25 to 44, 23.7% from 45 to 64, and 10.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $100,313, and the median income for a family was $51,181. Males had a median income of $38,958 versus $24,803 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $18,052. About 4.4% of families and 14.109% of the population were below the poverty line, including those under age 18 and 24.055% of those age 65 or over.

==Attractions==
The Gap Town Clock, built in 1892, is a Lancaster County Historic Preservation Trust Site. According to the Gap Clock Tower Association, &quot;The clock&#x27;s face, long telling the time to passing multitudes, overlooks, at the gap, William Penns&#x27; entrance into Conestoga, now Lancaster County, in 1701.&quot;

==Media==

On April 20, 2001, Gap became home to first generation Low Power FM broadcast station WNUZ-LP. WNUZ has had many studio locations in Gap, including along 100 block of Christiana Avenue in the Sadsbury Township, section of Gap. In the 800 block of Pequea Avenue and originally along the 700 block of County Line Road. WNUZ is a volunteer, all news community radio station engaging the community and vicinity to participate in the daily live through free speech journalism, social economic and community strengthening activities, programs and services. WNUZ is a partner of many Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Lancaster County and Chester County local programs and services. Although The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) eliminated the main studio rule in 2017, making it effective January 8, 2018. (The rule required broadcast stations to have a main studio in or near their community. The FCC found the rule outdated and burdensome.) WNUZ did not shut its main studios to the public until the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, June 1, 2020. In 2018, WNUZ began streamlining many of its public services to its website WNUZ.org (then WLRI).

<doc id="99679" wikidata="Q1527491" url="?curid=99679" title="Swaffham">
<text>Swaffham () is a market town and civil parish in the Breckland District and English county of Norfolk. It is situated east of King&#x27;s Lynn and west of Norwich.

The civil parish has an area of and in the 2001 census had a population of 6,935 in 3,130 households, which increased to 7,258, in 3,258 households, at the 2011 census. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of Breckland.

==History==

The name of the town derives from the Old English &quot;Swǣfa hām&quot; = &quot;the homestead of the Swabians&quot;; some of them presumably came with the Angles and Saxons.

By the 14th and 15th centuries Swaffham had an emerging sheep and wool industry. As a result of this prosperity, the town has a large market place. The market cross here was built by George Walpole, 3rd Earl of Orford and presented to the town in 1783. On the top is the statue of Ceres, the Roman goddess of the harvest. The former Corn Hall, which was designed by Mathias Goggs, was completed in 1858.

About 8 km to the north of Swaffham can be found the ruins of the formerly important Castle Acre Priory and Castle Acre Castle.

On the west side of Swaffham Market Place are several old buildings which for many years housed the historic Hamond&#x27;s Grammar School, as a plaque on the wall of the main building explains. The Hamond&#x27;s Grammar School building latterly came to serve as the sixth form for the Hamond&#x27;s High School, but that use has since ceased. Harry Carter, the grammar school&#x27;s art teacher of the 1960s, was responsible for a great number of the carved village signs that are now found in many of Norfolk&#x27;s towns and villages, including Swaffham&#x27;s own sign commemorating the legendary Pedlar of Swaffham, which is in the corner of the market place just opposite the old school&#x27;s gates. Carter was a distant cousin of the archaeologist and egyptologist Howard Carter who spent much of his childhood in the town.

The Swaffham Museum is a small, independent social history museum for Swaffham and the surrounding villages in Norfolk from the Stone Age to the modern. It has five galleries exhibiting local history and local geology as well as an Egyptology room about Howard Carter and the Ancient Egyptians, celebrating the centenary year of Howard Carter discovering the Tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922.

Swaffham was struck by a tornado measuring F1 on the Fujita scale and T2 on the TORRO scale on 23 November 1981 during the 1981 United Kingdom tornado outbreak.

==Folklore==

Swaffham is one of the many locations for &quot;The Man Who Became Rich through a Dream&quot; folk tale (Aarne-Thompson type 1645). The tale tells of a pedlar from Swaffham who dreamed for several consecutive nights that if he waited on London Bridge he would eventually hear good news. He travelled to London, and waited for several days on the bridge. Eventually a shopkeeper asked him why he was waiting, and the man told of his dream. The shopkeeper laughed, and replied that he often dreamed that if he went to a certain orchard in Swaffham and started digging, he would find buried treasure. The pedlar returned to Swaffham, and found the treasure.

In medieval folklore, a black, hairy dog called the Black Shuck was rumoured to have wandered the three settlements of Swaffham, Castle Acre, and Great Cressingham, ambushing merchants who were on their way to large towns to sell their goods. There are still rumours of a puma-like black cat wandering around Norfolk and Cambridgeshire.

==Parish church==
The church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul is one of only a few churches that have angels carved in wood instead of stone around the top of the walls. The current building, dating from 1454, is built on the foundation of the original church. A wood carving of the &quot;Pedlar of Swaffham&quot; is also in the church.

==Transport==
The nearest railway stations to Swaffham are at and , on the Fen line. There are regular services to , and , operated by Great Northern.

Until 1968, the town was served by Swaffham railway station on the Great Eastern Railway line from King&#x27;s Lynn. Just after Swaffham, the line split into two: one branch headed south to and the other east towards . The lines were all closed as part of the Beeching cuts, though the possibility of rebuilding a direct rail link from Norwich to King&#x27;s Lynn, via Swaffham, is raised occasionally.

The east–west A47 Birmingham to Great Yarmouth road now bypasses the town, using a northerly bypass opened in 1981. The A1065 Mildenhall to Fakenham road still passes through the centre of the town on its north–south route, intersecting with the A47 at a grade separated junction north of the town.

First Eastern Counties&#x27; Excel bus routes provide a regular public transport link through Swaffham between Dereham and King&#x27;s Lynn. Most services continue east to Norwich and west to Peterborough.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from either the Tacolneston or Sandy Heath TV transmitters 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Norfolk on 104.4 FM, Heart East on 102.4 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Norfolk &amp; North Suffolk on 96.7 FM, Amber Radio, Radio West Norfolk and KL1 Radio. 

The town&#x27;s local newspaper is the &quot;Watton and Swaffham Times&quot;.

==Sport and leisure==
Swaffham has a Non-League football club, Swaffham Town, which plays at Shoemakers Lane.

Swaffham Raceway, a former greyhound track, hosts stock car racing.

== Wind turbines and Green Britain Centre ==

Today the town is known for the presence of two large Enercon E-66 wind turbines. The first of these began operation in 1999 and the second in 2003. Together they generate more than three megawatts. The first of the wind turbines to be constructed was an Enercon E66/1500 with 1.5 MW generation capacity, 67 metres nacelle height and 66 metres rotor diameter. It was also built with an observation deck just below the nacelle which was open for the public to climb during the 2000s and 2010s, the only wind turbine in the world to have such a facility. These two turbines have since been joined by an independent development of a further eight turbines at the village of North Pickenham, three miles from Swaffham.

The turbines were originally associated with the EcoTech Centre, a visitor centre which was opened in 1999. The centre hosted the 2008 British BASE jumping championships; contestants jumped from the roof of the observation deck. In 2008 the energy company Ecotricity took over the management of the site and in 2012 the visitor centre was renamed the Green Britain Centre. The centre provided a venue for school trips and event hire, and had educational displays focussing on sustainability in food, energy and transport. The height of the attraction&#x27;s popularity was in 2016, when 22,000 people visited the centre and 8,000 climbed the turbine.

In June 2018 it was announced that the centre had closed for financial reasons and that Ecotricity intended to hand the building back to Breckland District Council (BDC). The council subsequently put it up for rent or sale and discussed exchanging it with Swaffham Town Council in return for of building land. A proposal to convert the building into a leisure centre was considered by BDC but ultimately abandoned. In 2021 the building was sold to manufacturer Flexion Global for use as their headquarters. Shortly after the sale, Swaffham Town Council gave BCD a parcel of land next to the centre on which BDC intends to build a leisure centre.

==Climate==

As with the rest of the British Isles and East Anglia, Swaffham experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest Met Office weather station to provide local climate data is RAF Marham, about west of the town centre. Temperature extremes in the Swaffham-Marham area range from in August 1990, down to during February 1956. The highest and lowest temperatures reported in the past decade are during August 2003, and during January 2010.
== &quot;Kingdom&quot; (TV series) ==

In the summer of 2006, location filming was done in the town for the ITV1 series &quot;Kingdom&quot;, starring Stephen Fry. In &quot;Kingdom&quot; the town is called Market Shipborough. The pub the &quot;Startled Duck&quot; in the TV series is better known as the &quot;Greyhound Inn&quot;, in which the Earl of Orford created the first coursing club open to the public, in 1776. Peter Kingdom&#x27;s office is Oakleigh House, near the town square (formerly the house of the Head Master of Hamond&#x27;s Grammar School), with the coastal scenes filmed at Wells-next-the-Sea on the north Norfolk coast.

<text>Sheringham (; population 7,367) is a seaside town and civil parish in the county of Norfolk, England. The motto of the town, granted in 1953 to the Sheringham Urban District Council, is &quot;Mare Ditat Pinusque Decorat&quot;, Latin for &quot;The sea enriches and the pine adorns&quot;.

==History==

The place-name &#x27;Sheringham&#x27; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Silingeham&quot;. It appears as &quot;Siringeham&quot; in 1174, and &quot;Scheringham&quot; in the &quot;Book of Fees&quot; (&quot;Liber feodorum&quot;) in 1242. The name means &#x27;the homestead of Scira&#x27;s people&#x27;.

Historically, the parish of Sheringham comprised the two villages of Upper Sheringham, a farming community, and Lower Sheringham, which combined farming with fishing.
The fishing industry was at its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as the coming of the railways made it possible for fish to be transported more efficiently to market. Through the 1900s the focus of the fishing, as all along the north Norfolk coast, began to be on crabs, lobsters and whelks. The local fishermen were major suppliers of crabs and lobsters to the London fish markets. Long lining for cod and the catching of herring began to become less important in the second half of the century, as did whelking. Today, from a peak of maybe 200 boats, Sheringham has eight boats operated single-handed.

The current town of Sheringham was once Lower Sheringham, a fishing station for the main village, now known as Upper Sheringham. It is a railway town that was developed with the coming of the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway line in the late 19th century. Most of Sheringham&#x27;s range of buildings and shops come from this period and the early 20th century. It has a particularly interesting range of buildings using flint, not normally in the traditional Norfolk style but in a variety of techniques. Sheringham Town Hall, the former headquarters of Sheringham Urban District Council, was completed in 1912.

In the First World War, Sheringham was hit by two bombs from a Zeppelin raid at 20:30 GMT on 18 January 1915, making it the first place in Britain to be attacked by Zeppelins from the air. No one was killed.

==The town today==

Sheringham town centre is centred on a traditional high street with a wide range of privately owned shops. On Saturdays throughout the year there is a popular market in the car park next to the railway station which attracts large crowds even out of the holiday season. The town also has a good selection of specialist shops such as second-hand books, antiques and bric-a-brac, fishing tackle and bait, a computer shop, a model shop, and arts and craft shops. The Sheringham Little Theatre has a wide range of productions on throughout the year including a well-established summer repertory season running from July to September, and a popular pantomime at Christmas; in the foyer is a coffee shop with display of art by local artists. There is a selection of food outlets, pubs, restaurants and a youth hostel.

On 15 October 2010, Tesco won a 14-year battle to open a store in the town. In a split vote North Norfolk District Council development committee chairman Simon Partridge used his casting vote in favour of the scheme. The store finally opened on 24 October 2013.

An annual Cromer and Sheringham Crab/Lobster festival is held in May, and the town&#x27;s Carnival is held at the beginning of August.

Otterndorf Green is a small green space between the town&#x27;s railway stations. It commemorates Sheringham&#x27;s twinning with the German town of Otterndorf.

The Church of England Parish Church of St Peter was consecrated in 1897.

==Sheringham Museum==

The town&#x27;s museum now known as &quot;The Mo&quot; includes a collection of old lifeboats, various displays, a viewing tower and houses the Sheringham Shoal Offshore Wind Farm visitor centre.

==Lifeboats==

Sheringham is reputed to be the only place in the world to have four of its original lifeboats. The Sheringham Museum Trust owns three of these:
JC Madge (1904–36) pulling and sailing.
Foresters Centenary (1936–61) the towns first motorised lifeboat.
Manchester Unity of Oddfellows (1961–90) an Oakley Class lifeboat, Sheringham&#x27;s last offshore boat. Within the next two to three years Sheringham Museum Trust plans to have an extended museum to house this unique collection together with three crab boats and general lifeboat and fishing industry ephemera. The town has no harbour, so the lifeboat has to be launched by tractor, and the fishing boats are hauled up the beach. An old sail-powered lifeboat is preserved in the former lifeboat shed and the three other preserved RNLI lifeboats are kept in another centre.

==Transport==
===Railway===
Sheringham railway station is the northern terminus on the Bittern Line, the National Rail route to Cromer and Norwich. Services run generally hourly and are operated by Greater Anglia. The station has a basic single platform structure that was opened in January 1967, following the closure of the original and more substantial station close by; the platform was rebuilt in 2019, to accommodate the new Class 755 trains which now operate the route.

====Heritage====

The line beyond the National Rail station has been preserved as the North Norfolk Railway, also known as the &quot;Poppy Line&quot;. It operates between Sheringham&#x27;s original station and a new station at Holt, via Weybourne. The railway operates primarily with steam and diesel-hauled trains, with some diesel multiple units.

The short link between the National Rail network and the North Norfolk Railway was re-established in 2010; the first train to use the link was hauled by 70013 &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot;.

===Buses===
Local bus services are provided by Sanders Coaches. The primary X40, X44 and 44A services run regularly between Sheringham, Cromer, Aylsham and Norwich. Routes also operate to other local destinations including Fakenham, Holt and Wells-next-the-Sea.

===Roads===
The A148, which connects King&#x27;s Lynn and Cromer, by-passes the southern part of the town.

== Schools ==
Sheringham has three schools. One is the Woodfields for disabled children, the other two are Sheringham High School and Sheringham Community Primary School.

==Media==
Local television news programmes are &quot;BBC Look East&quot; on BBC One and &quot;ITV News Anglia&quot; on ITV1. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Norfolk on 95.6 FM, Heart East on 102.4 FM, Greatest Hits Radio East (formerly North Norfolk Radio) on 103.2 FM, and Poppyland Community Radio, a community online based station which broadcast from the town.

The town is served by the local newspapers, &quot;North Norfolk News&quot; and &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot;.

==Places of worship==

St Joseph&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church 
The Roman Catholic Church of St Joseph, on Cromer Road was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott. In 1901 a donation of over £3,000 by Catherine Deterding, the wife of the managing director and founder of the Shell Oil Company, enabled the purchase of land around an existing chapel to build a new church. Work began in 1902 and the first section, St Joseph&#x27;s chapel was completed in 1908. In 1910 the second section opened, which comprises the sanctuary, nave and the porch. Later the church was completed by extending the nave and adding a new porch. The complete building was consecrated on 25 March 1935. From the outside it is possible to see the join between the northern two-thirds opened in 1910, and the southern extension completed in 1935. This large red-brick church towers over its neighbours. The north end, (the liturgical east), has a high rose window, while each long side is pierced by three vast Perpendicular-style windows. The church is entered through a porch and into a narthex on the south west corner of the building. Behind a grilled area to the east there is a large framed icon of the Blessed Virgin. Inside the church the height and narrowness emphasizes the arcades which are also of a good height and have arches of alternate sizes. The décor is a mixture of both the arts and crafts movement and industrial Gothic, a signature of Gibert Scott&#x27;s style. The font is a replica the seven sacraments font at St Mary and All Saints, Little Walsingham. There are some good pieces of early 20th century devotional art much of which was imported from the studio and workshop of Ferdinand Stuflesser in the Austrian Tyrol. There is a rood screen above the entrance to the sanctuary. The Stations of the Cross, ordered from Stuflesser, spent the First World War in the hold of a German freighter impounded at Genoa. 
The Church of England Parish Church of St Peter was consecrated in 1897.

==War memorial==

The memorial to the men and women of Sheringham and Beeston Regis who died in military service during the two world wars is located at on the traffic island at the intersection of the Boulevard, St Nicholas Place and the Esplanade. It was designed by Herbert Palmer somewhat in the style of an Eleanor cross. It is of Clipsham stone and stands tall. It was unveiled on 1 January 1921. The names of the dead are on four panels that form the base of the cross. A recent addition to the memorial is a small wrought-iron fence around the base with poppy motifs. There are also further names on memorial boards in the nearby parish church of St Peter.

==Sheringham Hall and other prominent property==
*In 1811, the Sheringham Estate was bought by Abbot and Charlotte Upcher. They asked Humphry Repton to design Sheringham Hall. The Upcher family also built a school. The Hall is still privately occupied, but the plantations of Sheringham Park are in the care of the National Trust and open to visitors.
*The Dales, formerly the residence of Henry Douglas King, M.P., and later Major William James Spurrell, D.S.O., M.C., is now a hotel (The Dales Country House).
* Sheringham watermill was mainly known as a papermill that operated from around 1750 to about 1865, although it quite possibly started life as a corn mill. It had an overshot waterwheel, which seems quite remarkable when considering the surrounding terrain and the fact that the mill was only supplied by the small Beeston Beck. A blue plaque on the wall of a cottage marks the location of the mill in Beeston road which was then called Paper Mill Road.
* The Masonic Hall on Cromer Road. Was once the Electric Picture Palace.

== Offshore wind farm ==
The town is also home to a large 317MW wind farm, the Sheringham Shoal Offshore Wind Farm, approximately to offshore.

== The Oddfellows Hall ==
The Oddfellows Hall on the Lifeboat Plain, built in 1867, was the original RNLI Lifeboat station and a gathering place for fishermen and boat builders, and has over the years been used as a craft centre, used to exhibit a model railway, and to display a model village. The hall was also used as a shoe factory. After years of standing idle, it re-opened in October 2007 having been completely refurbished at a cost of £250,000. A collection of organisations such as East of England Development Agency, North Norfolk District Council, Sheringham plus Community Partnership and other interested parties worked together to facilitate the refurbishment of the hall and bring it back into community use.

==Beeston Bump==
Sheringham nestles under the nearby hill of Beeston Bump, a geological SSSI which was the site of one of the Second World War secret Y-stations. The Bump can be climbed using the Norfolk Coast Path from either the east or west. The Bump is a kame, a glacial deposit that began forming between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago at the end of the latest Ice Age. The huge mass of ice caused a depression in the land and, as the ice melted, the land mass began to &#x27;spring&#x27; slowly back in a process called isostatic readjustment. This process still occurs in the UK, as Northern England is slowly rising.
==Sea defences==
The northern frontage of Sheringham is protected by a concrete seawall which also serves as the promenade. It is a vital part of the protection of the town against the natural erosion that occurs along the North Norfolk coast. The storm surge of 1953 considerably damaged Sheringham&#x27;s wooden sea defences. In front of the sea wall are groynes, armoured at their bases with large blocks of natural rock, which prevent long shore drift. There are numerous drains along the frontage. To the east towards West Runton the seawall ends just below Beeston Bump. From there a timber revetment and groyne system, designed and constructed in 1976, runs eastwards for 2 km (just over a mile) to West Runton Gap. The shoreline management plans of the Department for Environment include a policy of &quot;managed retreat&quot; along this stretch of coast. The revetment between Sheringham and West Runton is no longer being maintained and is thus in a poor state of repair. Sections that become hazardous will be removed. The coastline will then be left to evolve naturally.

==Sport and leisure==
Sheringham has a Non-League football club Sheringham F.C. who play at Weybourne Road. Sheringham Golf Club opened in 1891. In October 2016, it was announced a disused sewage outlet pipe stretching from the beach into the sea will form the North Sea&#x27;s &quot;first snorkel trail&quot;. Sheringham Golf Club is located on town&#x27;s western outskirts and is bounded by the North Sea and the North Norfolk Railway. A modern sports and leisure complex, incorporating a swimming pool and gym, and known as The Reef Leisure Centre, opened on Weybourne Road in late 2021, replacing the ageing &#x27;Splash&#x27; facility that had occupied the site.

<text>Silverlink was a train operating company in the United Kingdom owned by National Express that operated the North London Railways franchise from March 1997 until November 2007. At the end of 2007 Silverlink Metro services were taken over by London Overground and Silverlink County services were taken over by London Midland.

==History==
The North London Railways franchise was awarded to National Express on 7 February 1997. National Express commenced operating the franchise on 3 March 1997.

After initially trading as North London Railways, in September 1997 the franchise was rebranded as Silverlink.

The franchise was due to finish on 15 October 2006, but on 11 August 2006 the Department for Transport granted an extension until 10 November 2007. Upon its closure, its London metro services were taken over by London Overground and the remainder were merged with Central Trains&#x27; western services to form London Midland.

==Branding==
Silverlink had two sub-brands:

Silverlink Metro was used for services primarily within Greater London: 
*North Woolwich – Richmond (the North London Line)
*Willesden Junction – Clapham Junction (the West London Line)
*London Euston – Watford Junction via Willesden Junction (the Watford DC line)
*Gospel Oak – Barking (the Gospel Oak to Barking Line)
Silverlink County was used for services beyond Greater London:
* – Northampton (Birmingham New Street until 2004)
*Watford Junction – St Albans Abbey (the St Albans Abbey Line)
*Bletchley – Bedford (the Marston Vale Line)

===Silverlink Metro===
Silverlink Metro operated these services.

====North London line====
These services ran on the North London line:
† At the end of service on Saturday 9 December 2006 the line between Stratford and North Woolwich closed, as much of the route was duplicated by the Docklands Light Railway and the Jubilee line, leaving Stratford as the eastern terminus of the North London Line.

====West London line====
These services ran via the West London line:
Shepherd&#x27;s Bush on the West London Line was due to open under the franchise (with signage in Silverlink colours installed), but platform widening work meant that it finally opened in September 2008 under London Overground management, the signage being replaced with the London Overground roundels by that time.

====Watford DC line====
These services ran on the Watford DC line:
† = also served by the Bakerloo line.

====Gospel Oak to Barking line====
These services ran on the Gospel Oak to Barking line:
===Silverlink County===

====Birmingham/Northampton====

Birmingham Line services ran on the slow lines of the West Coast Main Line. The service was cut back to Northampton in September 2004, with services north of Northampton being transferred to partner operator Central Trains, and some through services remained. (Central Trains, like Silverlink, was a subsidiary of National Express and the operations shared rolling stock.) 
Prior to 2004 the service also continued to Birmingham, calling at the following stations:
====Abbey Line====
These services ran on the Abbey Line
====Marston Vale line====
These services ran on the Marston Vale line between and :
==Performance==
Silverlink was categorised as a London and South East operator by the Office for Rail Regulation (ORR) and was one of the best performing TOCs in this sector with a PPM (Public Performance Measure) of 90.8% for the last quarter of the financial year 2006/7. Despite these figures, the Silverlink Metro franchise on the North London Line was regarded by frequent travellers as offering a poor service, with extremely congested trains and an unreliable service with some trains cancelled shortly before they were due to arrive. A London Assembly report said passengers found the service &quot;shabby, unreliable, unsafe and overcrowded&quot;.

==Rolling stock==
Silverlink inherited a fleet of Class 117 and Class 121 diesel multiple units, and Class 313 and Class 321 electric multiple units, from British Rail.

To replace the elderly Class 117s and 121s, which operated the Gospel Oak - Barking and Bletchley - Bedford services, seven Class 150 &quot;Sprinters&quot; were transferred from Central Trains in summer 1999; an eighth followed in 2006. Pending the Sprinters&#x27; arrival, Silverlink hired Class 31 locomotives from Fragonset to top and tail Mark 2 carriages on Bletchley - Bedford services in 1998/99.

The Class 313s operated Metro services on the electrified routes; they were joined on the Euston - Watford Junction service in 2003 by three Class 508s transferred from Merseyrail. The Class 321s operated County services to Northampton and Birmingham; they were joined in 2005 by new Class 350s. The Watford Junction - St Albans Abbey service was operated for many years by Class 313s, but later was usually operated by Class 321s with Silverlink Metro drivers and Silverlink County guards.

On 16 July 2004, Virgin Trains announced that it was withdrawing most of its stops at Milton Keynes Central, which were used by up to 6,000 passengers a day. Commuters became unhappy at the prospect of switching to older Silverlink trains, and a longer journey. Silverlink countered this with the temporary usage of ex-Virgin stock, still in Virgin colours.

The Strategic Rail Authority decided to divert thirty four-carriage Siemens Desiro trains from an order placed by South West Trains to provide stock with faster acceleration for the West Coast Main Line operators. These trains, the Class 350s, were not allocated to a specific operator, but were instead used jointly by Silverlink and Central Trains, both owned by National Express.

Pending the arrival of these trains, from September 2004 Silverlink introduced two sets of Mark 3 carriages, formerly of Virgin Trains, hauled by Virgin Class 87 and EWS Class 90 electric locomotives on peak-hour Northampton services. Additionally, five Class 321s were hired from One, another National Express-owned operator.

===Fleet===


==Depots==
Silverlink&#x27;s fleet was maintained at Bletchley Depot. Following Virgin Trains ceasing to operate electric locomotives, Silverlink&#x27;s Metro fleet moved to Willesden Depot.

In 2006 Alstom proposed closing Willesden. The depot&#x27;s closure would have meant the Class 508s would have had to relocate to another depot, and the Class 313s having to return to Bletchley Depot (which was also due to close). On 12 May 2007, Silverlink took over direct running of the depot and its staff for the final six months of its franchise.

==Demise==
As part of a wider redrawing of the rail franchise map by the Department for Transport, the Silverlink network was to be broken up when it was renewed in November 2007.

The Silverlink Metro services were moved to the control of Transport for London under the banner of the London Overground. On 19 June 2007 Transport for London announced it had awarded the London Overground concession to a Laing Rail/MTR joint venture.

The Silverlink County services were merged with the Central Trains services around Birmingham to create a new West Midlands franchise. On 22 June 2007 the Department for Transport announced it had awarded the West Midlands franchise to Govia.

Silverlink&#x27;s services transferred to London Overground Rail Operations and London Midland on 11 November 2007.

<text>Mobico Group, formerly National Express Group, is a British multinational public transport company with headquarters in Birmingham, England. Domestically it currently operates bus and coach services under brands including National Express. The company also operates transport services including trains abroad: in the Republic of Ireland, United States, Canada, Spain, Portugal, Malta, Germany, Bahrain, Morocco, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and South Korea, and long-distance coach services across Europe. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.

==History==
===Early years===


In 1972, the state-owned National Bus Company decided to bring together the scheduled coach services operated by its bus operating companies in the United Kingdom under one brand. Sir Frederick Wood, a prominent businessman and industrialist, was asked to oversee the creation of this new business model and led the group as its chairman from 1972 to 1978. Initially branded as &quot;National&quot;, the &quot;National Express&quot; brand was first used in 1974.

With the privatisation of the National Bus Company in the 1980s, National Express was subject to a management buyout in March 1988. The management team pursued various means of diversification; during 1989, the company purchased Crosville Wales.

===1990s===
Starting in early 1990s, National Express&#x27; financial performance began to deteriorate; this led to a new management team taking over the company in July 1991 which had the backing of ECI Partners, a mid-market private equity firm. The new team refocused the group on its core activities, leading to the sale of Crosville Wales to British Bus. During October 1991, it purchased Speedlink, an operator of coach services between Gatwick and Heathrow Airports. In December 1992, National Express Group plc was floated on the London Stock Exchange.

In 1993, Scottish Citylink, Eurolines and East Midlands Airport were acquired. During April 1995, National Express purchased West Midlands Travel, the formerly council-owned bus network of Birmingham and the West Midlands; it was rebranded Travel West Midlands in September 1996. This move began the brand family of &quot;Travel ...&quot; local bus operations. Bournemouth Airport was acquired in April 1995.

During April 1996, National Express commenced operating its first UK railway franchises, Gatwick Express and Midland Mainline. One year later, three other franchises were awarded, these being Silverlink, Central Trains and ScotRail. To comply with a Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission ruling on it winning the ScotRail franchise, National Express sold the Scottish Citylink operation to Metroline in August 1998.

In February 1997, Taybus Public Transport was acquired and rebranded Travel Dundee.

During September 1998, Crabtree-Harmon, the seventh-largest student transportation bus company in the United States was acquired, with 82 school bus contracts mainly in Missouri, but also in other Midwest states including Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma and Utah. During February 1999, Robinson Bus Service was purchased; it was followed in August 1999 by Durham Transportation. These acquisitions placed National Express as one of the top three United States school bus operators.

In May 1999, National Express purchased Australia&#x27;s largest private bus operator, National Bus Company. National Bus Company had bus operations in Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth, and also held a 57% shareholding in Westbus, Sydney&#x27;s largest bus operator. Westbus also had a London coach operation. In August 1999, National Express was awarded the M&gt;Train, M&gt;Tram and V/Line Passenger rail franchises in the Australian state of Victoria.

===2000s===
During January 2000, National Express expanded into the American market by acquiring ATC, a public transportation operator. In July 2000, Prism Rail was purchased, though which the c2c, Wales &amp; Borders, Wessex Trains and West Anglia Great Northern franchises were added to National Express&#x27; portfolio.

In December 2002, National Express handed in its rail franchises in Victoria, Australia, having been unable to renegotiate financial terms with the State Government.

During February 2004, the London bus operations of Connex were purchased and rebranded Travel London. In April 2004, National Express East Anglia commenced operating the Greater Anglia rail franchise. In September 2004, National Express sold its Melbourne bus operations to Ventura Bus Lines, and Brisbane and Perth bus operations to Connex. After being placed in administration in January 2005, Westbus was sold to ComfortDelGro Cabcharge in August 2005.

In June 2005, the London bus arm of Tellings-Golden Miller was purchased by National Express, after which it was rebranded as Travel London. During July 2005, National Express sold ATC to Connex. In October 2005, the company agreed to buy most of the operations of privately owned Spanish transport operator ALSA, which operates bus and coach services in Spain, Portugal and Morocco, and long-distance coach services to other parts of Europe. Alsa&#x27;s operations in South America and China were retained by the previous owners.

In April 2007, National Express acquired Continental Auto, the second-largest bus and coach operator in Spain.
During November 2007, South East England coach operator The Kings Ferry was purchased and an airport to hotel shuttle service in London branded Dot2Dot was launched. Dot2Dot did not prove to be commercially viable and thus ceased operations in November 2008.

In November 2007, National Express announced plans to re-brand all of their operations under a new unified National Express identity. It was intended to achieve greater recognition for all the group companies, to coincide with recent acquisitions and after current rail operations had improved in reliability to warrant association with the established express coach image. It coincided with the appointment of a group director for all UK operations and relocation of the head office from London to Birmingham, bringing all operations under a single strategic management structure. Day-to-day management remained within individual companies.

During February 2007, the Department for Transport announced that National Express, along with Arriva, First, and Virgin Rail Group, had been shortlisted to lodge bids for the InterCity East Coast franchise. In August 2007, the Department for Transport awarded the Intercity East Coast franchise to National Express, leading to the creation of National Express East Coast (NXEC) shortly thereafter. Under the terms of its franchise agreement, National Express committed to paying a £1.4-billion premium to the Department of Transport over a time span of seven years and four months. However, numerous rail analysts promptly voiced concerns that the company had paid too much for the franchise, and had effectively repeated GNER&#x27;s mistake in order to secure the franchise. On 9 December 2007, National Express East Coast commenced operations, taking over from Great North Eastern Railway.

In May 2009, National Express sold Travel London and Travel Surrey to Abellio.

===Operational safety concerns===
On 3 January 2007, a speeding National Express coach overturned on the M4/M25 slip road, leaving three passengers dead. The driver was jailed for five years.

In July 2009, a junior transport minister, the Gillingham MP Paul Clark, listed a series of concerns to National Express in a letter following a meeting with an employee of National Express East Coast who lives in his constituency. The worker claimed that, due to reduced maintenance checks, some trains were in use with defective brakes, an allegation that was strongly denied by the company, which stated it would &quot;never compromise on safety&quot;. He wrote: &quot;As a result of reduced maintenance checks, &#x27;some long-haul sets [trains] are in use with brake defects&#x27;. Increasing cuts in staff combined with an increasing pressure to ensure that trains run safely has resulted in fears among staff that a major accident is &#x27;just around the corner&#x27;.&quot; Passengers, he added, &quot;have been &#x27;poisoned&#x27; as a result of coffee machines not being cleaned correctly, with cleaning fluids left in situ&quot;. The minister said he was &quot;shocked and appalled at the information with which I&#x27;ve been provided. You will understand that these allegations are exceptionally serious&quot;.

School bus drivers in the US have raised concerns about the safety of the buses run by Durham, a subsidiary of National Express, and the second-largest operator of school bus services in North America. According to representatives of Durham bus drivers, fluid leaks, tyres that need to be replaced, black mould and non-functional emergency equipment are regular concerns, whilst workers continued to operate buses while sick because they cannot afford to miss a day of work and drivers are not paid for all the time they work.

===Default on East Coast rail franchise===

By 2009, National Express East Coast had come under increasing financial pressure due to various factors, including compounding rises in fuel prices and the poor economic climate of the time, commonly known as the Great Recession. In contrast to the company&#x27;s projected revenue increases during its franchise, NXEC&#x27;s actual operating income (generated primarily from ticket sales) had decreased by 1 percent during the first half of 2009. According to &quot;Rail&quot;, the franchise had quickly garnered a reputation for cost-cutting and a decline in service levels, particularly in terms of the onboard catering. It had also introduced various new charges, such as a £2.50 per journey leg for seat reservations.

During April 2009, National Express confirmed that the company was still pursuing talks with the government over possible financial assistance with the franchise, either through a reduction in the premium due or some other form of assistance. During these negotiations, the company had reportedly offered to pay over £100 million to be released from its commitment to operate the franchise. In July 2009, the Department for Transport announced that it would take the National Express East Coast franchise into public ownership at the end of the year after National Express announced it would not invest any further funds into the franchise, effectively declaring it planned to default. In defaulting on the franchise, National Express directly incurred losses of £72 million by forfeiting bonds. Directly Operated Railways took over the East Coast franchise on 14 November 2009.

The franchise failure sparked public and industry calls for the permanent public ownership of the InterCity East Coast franchise, or even the complete scrapping of the entire franchise system. In November 2009, the government announced that National Express East Anglia would not be granted a three-year extension that it had otherwise qualified for; this was reportedly a result of the East Coast default. However, National Express were subsequently granted an extension until October 2011, followed by another through to February 2012.

===Prospective takeover===

With the company&#x27;s finances under stress largely as a result of having overbid for the National Express East Coast rail franchise, National Express became a takeover target in 2009. In June 2009, a takeover offer from fellow transport operator FirstGroup was rejected. On 3 September 2009, National Express&#x27; largest shareholder, Spain&#x27;s Cosmen family with 18.5%, and CVC Capital Partners made a takeover offer of £765 million for the company. The Takeover Panel set a deadline of 11 September 2009 for all prospective bids.

During September 2009, National Express agreed to allow the Cosmen/CVC consortium to undertake due diligence. During the following month, the Cosmen/CVC consortium had reportedly reached an agreement to sell the UK bus and rail operations to rival transport operator Stagecoach Group if its offer was successful. The deadline for offers was subsequently extended to 16 October 2009.

On 16 October 2009, the Cosmen/CVC consortium announced that they had withdrawn their offer. That same day, Stagecoach submitted its own all-share bid to acquire National Express. This, too, did not proceed and, in November 2009, National Express announced it would raise the necessary capital through a share issue.

===2010s===
During February 2013, National Express Germany was awarded two regional rail contracts by the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr, Zweckverband Nahverkehr Rheinland and Zweckverband Nahverkehr Westfalen-Lippe authorities that commenced in December 2015.

In January 2015, the Bayerische Eisenbahngesellschaft announced that National Express had been selected to operate the Nuremberg S-Bahn system from December 2018. It was to have been the first Deutsche Bahn S-Bahn network to be taken over by a private operator. However, in October 2016, National Express elected to pull out, citing a delay in the ability to order new rolling stock while a challenge brought on by Deutsche Bahn was resolved, would make its bid unviable.

In June 2015, it was announced that the parts 2 and 3 of the Rhein-Ruhr-Express which will be introduced in 2018 will be operated by National Express. This includes Regional-Express services RE4, RE5 and RE6 in Northrhine-Westphalia.

In December 2016, coach operator Clarkes of London was purchased with 56 vehicles. In March 2020, Lucketts Travel was purchased.

===Takeover attempt and rebranding===
During September 2021, it was reported that National Express had entered into talks to acquire Stagecoach Group. In December 2021, a deal was agreed between the boards of the two companies: however, it was subject to both shareholder approval and regulatory scrutiny. Having originally recommended shareholders accept the National Express offer, in March 2022, the Stagecoach board of directors withdrew its recommendation in favour of a takeover offer from a DWS managed investment fund.

In January 2023, the coach excursion business of seven National Express Transport Solutions companies (Coliseum Coaches, Lucketts Travel, Mortons Travel, Solent Tours, Stewarts Tours, Woods Tours and Worthing Coaches) were brought together under the &#x27;Touromo&#x27; brand. Touromo aimed to provide day trips and short breaks to destinations across the UK and Europe as one combined brand, and National Express planned to expand the brand outside the West Midlands and South East England to operate across the United Kingdom. Six months later, however, it was announced that Touromo was to cease operations and that National Express Transport Solutions was to cease offering day trips and holiday excursions in October 2023.

In June 2023, National Express changed its name to Mobico Group.

In August 2024, Mobico announced that they had begun the process of selling its North American school bus division, including Durham School Services, in order to reduce its debt.

<text>The Wildlife Trusts, the trading name of the Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts, is an organisation made up of 46 local Wildlife Trusts in the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and Alderney. The Wildlife Trusts, between them, look after more than 2,600 nature reserves, covering around . , the Trusts have a combined membership of over 944,000 members.

The Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts (RSWT) is an independent charity, with a membership formed of the 46 individual charitable Trusts. It acts as an umbrella group for the individual Wildlife Trusts, as well as operating a separate Grants Unit which administers a number of funds.

King Charles III serves as the patron of the Wildlife Trusts. David Bellamy was president of The Wildlife Trusts for ten years between 1995 and 2005, and was succeeded by Aubrey Manning. Sir David Attenborough, Simon King and Tony Juniper are all Presidents Emeritus. Stephanie Hilborne OBE was chief executive for 15 years, and left in October 2019. Craig Bennett became CEO from April 6, 2020.

==Activities==
Wildlife Trusts are local organisations of differing size, history and origins, and can vary greatly in their constitution, activities and membership. However, all Wildlife Trusts share a common interest in wildlife and biodiversity, rooted in a practical tradition of land management and conservation. Almost all Wildlife Trusts are significant landowners, with many nature reserves. Collectively they are the third largest voluntary sector landowners in the UK. They often have extensive educational activities, and programmes of public events and education. The Wildlife Trusts centrally and locally also lobby for better protection of the UK&#x27;s natural heritage, by becoming involved in planning matters and by national campaigning through the Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts. The Trusts rely heavily upon volunteer labour for many of their activities, but nevertheless employ significant numbers of staff in countryside management and education. Thanks to their work promoting the personal and social development of young people, The Wildlife Trusts is a member of The National Council for Voluntary Youth Services (NCVYS).

The Wildlife Trusts offer a Biodiversity Benchmark scheme through which companies can be assessed and recognised for their contribution to biodiversity. The assessment covers the organisation&#x27;s performance under the headings of &quot;Commitment, Planning, Implementation, and Monitoring and Review&quot;.

The Wildlife Trusts are one of the steering group partners of Neighbourhoods Green, a partnership initiative which works with social landlords and housing associations to highlight the importance of, and raise the overall quality of design and management for, open and green space in social housing.

Kathryn Brown OBE was appointed as the charity’s first director of climate action in January 2022.

== History ==

Today&#x27;s Wildlife Trust movement began life as The Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves (SPNR), which was formed by Charles Rothschild in 1912. It aimed initially to draw up a list of the country&#x27;s best wildlife sites with a view to purchase for protection as nature reserves, and by 1915 it had drawn up a list of 284 (including the Farne Islands and the Norfolk Broads), known as Rothschild Reserves. During the early years, membership tended to be made up of specialist naturalists and its growth was comparatively slow. The first independent Trust was formed in Norfolk in 1926 as the Norfolk Naturalists Trust, followed in 1938 by the Pembrokeshire Bird Protection Society which after several subsequent changes of name is now the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales and it was not until the 1940s and 1950s that more Naturalists&#x27; Trusts were formed in Yorkshire (1946), Lincolnshire (1948), Leicestershire (1956) and Cambridgeshire (1956). These early Trusts tended to focus on purchasing land to establish nature reserves in the geographical areas they served.

Encouraged by the growing number of Trusts, the SPNR began in 1957 to discuss the possibility of forming a national federation of Naturalists&#x27; Trusts. Kent Naturalists Trust was established in 1958 with SPNR being active in encouraging its formation. In the following year the SPNR established the County Naturalists&#x27; Committee, which organised the first national conference for Naturalists&#x27; Trusts at Skegness in 1960. By 1964, the number of Trusts had increased to 36 and the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves had changed its name to The Society for the Promotion of Nature Conservation. In recognition of the movement&#x27;s growing importance, its name was changed to The Royal Society for Nature Conservation in 1981.

The movement continued to develop throughout the 1970s, and, by the early 1980s, most of today&#x27;s Trusts had been established. In 1980, the first urban Wildlife Trust (now the Wildlife Trust for Birmingham and the Black Country) was established in the West Midlands, rapidly followed by others in London, Bristol and Sheffield. This was a watershed for the movement that strengthened its focus on wildlife and people. It was during this period that some Trusts changed their names from Naturalist Societies to Trusts for Nature Conservation. In 2002 the group changed their name to The Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts. The badger logo was adopted by the movement to establish its common identity. Also in 2002, the newest wildlife trust was formed, in Alderney.

As the number of Trusts grew, so did their combined membership, from 3,000 in 1960 to 21,000 in 1965. Membership topped 100,000 in 1975, and in that year Wildlife Watch was launched as a children&#x27;s naturalist club. By the late 1980s membership had reached 200,000, increasing to 260,000 in 1995, and over 500,000 by 2004. The combined membership for 2007 stood at 670,000 members, 108,000 belonging to the junior branch Wildlife Watch.

By 2012, membership was over 800,000, with over 150,000 Wildlife Watch members.

<text>The gaur (Bos gaurus; ) is a large bovine native to the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia, and has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1986. The global population was estimated at a maximum of 21,000 mature individuals in 2016, with the majority of those existing in India.
It is the largest species among the wild cattle and the Bovidae.

== Etymology ==
The Sanskrit word means &#x27;white, yellowish, reddish&#x27;. The Sanskrit word means a kind of water buffalo.

The Hindi word means &#x27;fair-skinned, fair, white&#x27;.

== Taxonomy ==

&quot;Bison gaurus&quot; was the scientific name proposed by Charles Hamilton Smith in 1827. Later authors subordinated the species under either &quot;Bos&quot; or &quot;Bibos&quot;.

To date, three gaur subspecies have been recognized:
* &quot;B. g. gaurus&quot;; the nominate subspecies, ranges in India, Nepal and Bhutan.
* &quot;B. g. readei&quot;; described by Richard Lydekker in 1903, based on a specimen from Myanmar, and is thought to range from Upper Myanmar to Tanintharyi Region.
* &quot;B. g. hubbacki&quot;; described by Lydekker in 1907, based on a specimen from Pahang in Peninsular Malaysia. It was thought to range from Peninsular Malaysia and northward through Tenasserim. This classification, based largely on differences in coloration and size, is no longer widely recognized.

In 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature fixed the valid specific name of the wild gaur as the first available name based on the wild population, despite being antedated by the name for the domestic form. Most authors have adopted the binomial &quot;Bos gaurus&quot; for the wild species as valid for the taxon.

In recognition of phenotypic differences between zoological specimens of Indian and Southeast Asian gaur, the trinomials &quot;Bos gaurus gaurus&quot; and &quot;Bos gaurus laosiensis&quot; are provisionally accepted, pending further morphometric and genetic study.

Within the genus &quot;Bos&quot;, the gaur is most closely related to the banteng (&quot;Bos javanicus&quot;) and the probably now extinct kouprey (&quot;Bos sauveli&quot;), which are also native to Southeast Asia. Relationships of members of the genus &quot;Bos&quot; based on nuclear genomes after Sinding, et al. 2021.

== Characteristics ==

The gaur is the largest extant bovid. It is a strong and massively built bovine with a high convex ridge on the forehead between the horns, which protrudes anteriorly, causing a deep hollow in the profile of the upper part of the head. There is a prominent ridge on the back. The ears are very large. In the old bulls, the hair becomes very thin on the back. The adult male is dark brown, approaching black in very old individuals. The upper part of the head, from above the eyes to the nape of the neck, is ashy grey, or occasionally dirty white. The muzzle is pale coloured, and the lower part of the legs are pure white or tan. The cows and young bulls are paler, and in some instances have a rufous tinge, which is most marked in groups inhabiting dry and open areas. The tail is shorter than in the typical oxen, reaching only to the hocks. They have a distinct ridge running from the shoulders to the middle of the back; the shoulders may be as much as higher than the rump. This ridge is caused by the great length of the spinous processes of the vertebrae of the fore-part of the trunk as compared with those of the loins. The hair is short, fine and glossy; the hooves are narrow and pointed.

The gaur has a distinct dewlap on the throat and chest. Both sexes have horns, which grow from the sides of the head, curving upwards. Between the horns is a high convex ridge on the forehead. At their bases they present an elliptical cross-section, a characteristic that is more strongly marked in bulls than in cows. The horns are decidedly flattened at the base and regularly curved throughout their length, and are bent inward and slightly backward at their tips. The colour of the horns is some shade of pale green or yellow throughout the greater part of their length, but the tips are black. The horns, of medium size by large bovid standards, grow to a length of .
The cow is considerably lighter in colour than the bull. Her horns are more slender and upright, with more inward curvature, and the frontal ridge is scarcely perceptible. In young animals, the horns are smooth and polished. In old bulls they are rugged and dented at the base.

The gaur has a head-and-body length of with a long tail, and is high at the shoulder, averaging about in females and in males. At the top of its muscular hump just behind its shoulder, an average adult male is just under tall and the male&#x27;s girth at its midsection (behind its shoulders) averages about . Males are about one-fourth larger and heavier than females. Body mass ranges widely from in adult females and in adult males. In general, measurements are derived from gaurs surveyed in India. In a sample of 13 individuals in India, gaur males averaged about and females weighed a median of approximately . In China, the shoulder height of gaurs ranges from , and bulls weigh up to .

== Distribution and habitat ==

The gaur historically occurred throughout mainland South and Southeast Asia, including Nepal, India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and China. Today, its range is seriously fragmented, and it is regionally extinct in Peninsular Malaysia and Sri Lanka.
It is largely confined to evergreen forests or semi-evergreen and moist deciduous forests, but also inhabits deciduous forest areas at the periphery. Gaur habitat is characterized by large, relatively undisturbed forest tracts, hilly terrain below an elevation of , availability of water, and an abundance of forage in the form of grasses, bamboo, shrubs, and trees. Its apparent preference for hilly terrain may be partly due to the earlier conversion of most of the plains and other low-lying areas to croplands and pastures. It occurs from sea level to an elevation of at least . Low-lying areas seem to comprise optimal habitat.

In Nepal, the gaur population was estimated to be 250–350 in the mid-1990s, with the majority in Chitwan National Park and the adjacent Parsa National Park. These two parks are connected by a chain of forested hills. Population trends appeared to be relatively stable. The Chitwan population has increased from 188 to 368 animals in the years 1997 to 2016. Census conducted in Parsa National Park confirmed the presence of 112 gaur in the same period.

In India, the population was estimated to be 12,000–22,000 in the mid-1990s. The Western Ghats and their outflanking hills in southern India constitute one of the most extensive extant strongholds of gaur, in particular in the Wayanad – Nagarhole – Mudumalai – Bandipur complex. The populations in India, Bhutan and Bangladesh are estimated to comprise 23,000–34,000 individuals. Major populations of about 2,000 individuals have been reported in both Nagarahole and Bandipur National Parks, over 1,000 individuals in Tadoba Andhari Tiger Project, 500–1,000 individuals in both Periyar Tiger Reserve and Silent Valley and adjoining forest complexes, and over 800 individuals in Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary. Trishna Wildlife Sanctuary in southern Tripura is home to a significant number of individuals.

In Bhutan, they apparently persist all over the southern foothill zone, notably in Royal Manas National Park, Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary and Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary.

In Bangladesh, a few gaur occur in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, mostly in Banderban district. During a camera trap project, few gaur were recorded indicating that the population is fragmented and probably declining. Gaurs are hunted by local tribal people in Sangu Matamuhari reserve forest although hunting is prohibited in Bangladesh.

In Thailand, gaur were once found throughout the country, but fewer than 1,000 individuals were estimated to have remained in the 1990s. In the mostly semi-evergreen Dong Phayayen – Khao Yai Forest Complex, they were recorded at low density at the turn of the century, with an estimated total of about 150 individuals.

In Vietnam, several areas in Đắk Lắk Province were known to contain gaur in 1997. Several herds persist in Cát Tiên National Park and in adjacent state forest enterprises. The current status of the gaur population is poorly known; they may be in serious decline.

In Cambodia, gaur declined considerably in the period from the late 1960s to the early 1990s. The most substantial population of the country remained in Mondulkiri Province, where up to 1,000 individuals may have survived up to 2010 in a forested landscape of over . Results of camera trapping carried out in 2009 suggested a globally significant population of gaur in Sre Pok Wildlife Sanctuary and the contiguous Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, and line transect distance sampling from Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary showed around 500 individuals in 2010. Since then, there has been rapid decline of these populations, and likely all populations across Cambodia. Updated figures for Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary show a decline to only 33 individuals in 2020, and 2020 encounter rates in Sre Pok Wildlife Sanctuary and Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary were too low to analyze with distance sampling.

In Laos, up to 200 individuals were estimated to inhabit protected area boundaries in the mid-1990s. They were reported discontinuously distributed in low numbers. Overhunting had reduced the population, and survivors occurred mainly in remote sites. Fewer than six National Biodiversity Conservation Areas held more than 50 individuals. Areas with populations likely to be nationally important included the Nam Theun catchment and the adjoining plateau. Subsequent surveys carried out a decade later using fairly intensive camera trapping did not record any gaur any more, indicating a massive decline of the population.

In China, the gaur was present up to the 34th parallel north during the late Neolithic period about 5,200 years BP. Now it occurs only in heavily fragmented populations in Yunnan and southeastern Tibet. By the 1980s, it was extirpated in Lancang County, and the remaining animals were split into two populations in Xishuangbanna–Simao District and Cangyuan. In the mid-1990s, a population of 600–800 individuals may have lived in Yunnan Province, with the majority occurring in Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve.

In 2016, it was estimated that the global population has declined by more than 70% in Indochina and Malaysia during the last three generations of 24–30 years, and that the gaur is locally extinct in Sri Lanka. Populations in well-protected areas appeared to be stable.

== Ecology and behaviour ==

Where gaur have not been disturbed, they are basically diurnal. In other areas, they have become largely nocturnal due to human impact on the forest. In central India, they are most active at night, and are rarely seen in the open after 8 o&#x27;clock in the morning. During the dry season, herds congregate and remain in small areas, dispersing into the hills with the arrival of the monsoon. While gaur depend on water for drinking, they do not seem to bathe or wallow.

In January and February, gaur live in small herds of eight to 11 individuals, one of which is a bull. In April or May, more bulls may join the herd for mating, and individual bulls may move from herd to herd, each mating with many cows. In May or June, they leave the herd and may form herds of bulls only or live alone. Herds wander each day. Each herd has a nonexclusive home range, and sometimes herds may join in groups of 50 or more.

Gaur herds are led by an old adult female, the matriarch. Adult males may be solitary. During the peak of the breeding season, unattached males wander widely in search of receptive females. No serious fighting between males has been recorded, with size being the major factor in determining dominance. Males make a mating call of clear, resonant tones which may carry for more than . Gaur have also been known to make a whistling snort as an alarm call, and a low, cow-like moo.

In some regions in India where human disturbance is minor, the gaur is very timid and shy despite their great size and power. When alarmed, gaur crash into the jungle at a surprising speed. However, in Southeast Asia and South India, where they are used to the presence of humans, gaur are said by locals to be very bold and aggressive. They are frequently known to go into fields and graze alongside domestic cattle, sometimes killing them in fights. Gaur bulls may charge without provocation, especially during summer, when the intense heat and parasitic insects make them more short-tempered than usual. To warn other members of its herd of approaching danger, the gaur lets out a high whistle for help.

=== Feeding ecology ===

The gaur grazes and browses mostly the upper portions of plants, such as leaf blades, stems, seeds and flowers of grass species, including kadam &quot;Adina cordifolia&quot;.
During a survey in the Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park, gaurs were observed to feed on 32 species of plants. They consume herbs, young shoots, flowers, fruits of elephant apple (&quot;Dillenia&quot;) with a high preference for leaves. Food preference varies by season. In winter and monsoon, they feed on preferably fine and fresh true grasses and herb species of the legume family, such as tick clover (&quot;Desmodium triflorum&quot;), but also browse on leaves of shrub species such as karvy (&quot;Strobilanthes callosus&quot;), Indian boxwood (&quot;Gardenia latifolia&quot;), mallow-leaved crossberry (&quot;Grewia abutifolia&quot;), East-Indian screw tree (&quot;Helicteres&quot;) and the chaste tree (&quot;Vitex negundo&quot;). In summer, they also feed on bark of teak (&quot;Tectona grandis&quot;), on fruit of golden shower tree (&quot;Cassia fistula&quot;), and on the bark and fruit of cashew (&quot;Anacardium occidentale&quot;). Gaur spent most of their daily time feeding. Peak feeding activity was observed between 6:30 and 8:30 in the mornings and between 17:30 and 18:45 in the evenings. During the hottest hours of the day, they rest in the shade of big trees.

They may debark trees due to shortages of preferred food, and of minerals and trace elements needed for their nutrition, or for maintaining an optimum fiber/protein ratio for proper digestion of food and better assimilation of nutrients. They may turn to available browse species and fibrous teak bark in summer as green grass and herbaceous resources dry up. High concentrations of calcium (22400 ppm) and phosphorus (400 ppm) have been reported in teak bark, so consumption of teak bark may help animals to satisfy both mineral and other food needs. Long-term survival and conservation of these herbivores depend on the availability of preferred plant species for food. Hence, protection of the historically preferred habitats used by gaur is a significant factor in conservation biology.

=== Reproduction ===

Sexual maturity occurs in the gaur&#x27;s second or third year. Breeding takes place year-round, but typically peaks between December and June. Females have one calf, rarely two, after a gestation period of about 275 days, a few days less than domestic cattle. Calves are typically weaned after seven to 12 months. The lifespan of a gaur in captivity is up to 30 years.

=== Natural predators ===
Due to their size and power, gaur have few natural predators besides humans. Leopards, dhole packs and large mugger crocodiles occasionally attack unguarded calves or unhealthy animals. Only tigers and saltwater crocodiles have been reported to kill adult gaur. However, the habitat and distribution of the gaur and saltwater crocodile seldom overlap in recent times, due to the decreasing range of both species. A crocodile likely would need to be a mature adult male (more than and ) to make a successful attack on healthy adult gaurs.
Tigers hunt young or infirm gaur, but have also been reported to have killed healthy bulls weighing at least . When confronted by a tiger, the adult members of a gaur herd often form a circle surrounding the vulnerable young and calves, shielding them from the big cat. As tigers rely on ambush attacks when taking on prey as large as a gaur, they will almost always abandon a hunt if detected and met in this manner. A herd of gaur in Malaysia encircled a calf killed by a tiger and prevented it from approaching the carcass. Nevertheless, the gaur is a formidable opponent to the tiger and capable of killing tigers in self-defence.

== Threats ==
In Laos, the gaur is highly threatened by poaching for trade to supply international markets, but also by opportunistic hunting, and specific hunting for home consumption. In the 1990s, gaurs were particularly sought by Vietnamese poachers for their commercial value.
In Thailand, the gaur is severely threatened by poaching for commercial trade in meat and trophies.

== Conservation ==
The gaur is listed in CITES Appendix I, and is legally protected in all range states.

=== In captivity ===

On 8 January 2001, the first cloned gaur was born at Trans Ova Genetics in Sioux Center, Iowa. The calf was carried and brought successfully to term by a surrogate mother, a domestic cow (&quot;Bos taurus&quot;). While healthy at birth, the calf died within 48 hours of a common dysentery, most likely unrelated to cloning.

== In popular culture ==
* The gaur is the mascot of the 54th Infantry Division of the Indian Army, which is also called the &quot;Bison Division&quot;.
*The gaur is the state animal of Goa and Bihar. The Gaur is also the mascot of Goan football club FC Goa, competing in Indian Super League, where their team often referred as &quot;The Gaurs&quot;.
*The Red Gaurs ( ) were an extreme right-wing paramilitary organization active in Thailand during the 1970s.
*&quot;Krating Daeng&quot; today is a brand of energy drink featuring a pair of charging red gaur bulls in the logo; also used on the licensed derivative, &quot;Red Bull&quot;.

<text>Attached Resource Computer NETwork (ARCNET or ARCnet) is a communications protocol for local area networks. ARCNET was the first widely available networking system for microcomputers and it became popular in the 1980s for office automation tasks. It was later applied to embedded systems where certain features of the protocol are especially useful.

== History ==

=== Development ===
ARCNET was developed by principal development engineer John Murphy, at Datapoint Corporation in 1976 under Victor Poor, and announced in 1977. It was originally developed to connect groups of their Datapoint 2200 terminals to talk to a shared 8&quot; floppy disk system. It was the first loosely coupled LAN-based clustering system, making no assumptions about the &quot;type&quot; of computers that would be connected. This was in contrast to contemporary larger and more expensive computer systems such as DECnet or IBM&#x27;s SNA, where a homogeneous group of similar or proprietary computers were connected as a cluster.

The token-passing bus protocol of that I/O device-sharing network was subsequently applied to allowing processing nodes to communicate with each other for file-serving and computing scalability purposes. An application could be developed in DATABUS, Datapoint&#x27;s proprietary COBOL-like language, and deployed on a single computer with dumb terminals. When the number of users outgrew the capacity of the original computer, additional &#x27;compute&#x27; resource computers could be attached via ARCNET to run the same applications and access the same data. If more storage was needed, additional disk resource computers could also be attached. This incremental approach broke new ground and by the end of the 1970s (before the first IBM PC was announced in 1981), over ten thousand ARCNET LAN installations were in commercial use around the world while Datapoint had become a Fortune 500 company. As microcomputers took over the industry, well-proven and reliable ARCNET was also offered as an inexpensive LAN for these machines.

=== Market ===
ARCNET remained proprietary until the early-to-mid 1980s. This did not cause concern at the time, as most network architectures were proprietary. The move to non-proprietary, open systems began as a response to the dominance of International Business Machines (IBM) and its Systems Network Architecture (SNA). In 1979, the Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model (OSI model) was published. Then, in 1980, Digital, Intel and Xerox (the DIX consortium) published an open standard for Ethernet that was soon adopted as the basis of standardization by the IEEE and the ISO. IBM responded by proposing Token Ring as an alternative to Ethernet but kept such tight control over standardization that competitors were wary of using it. ARCNET was less expensive than either of these, was more reliable, more flexible and, by the late 1980s, had a market share about equal to that of Ethernet. Tandy/Radio Shack offered ARCNET as an application and file sharing medium for their TRS-80 Model II, Model 12, Model 16, Tandy 6000, Tandy 2000, Tandy 1000 and Tandy 1200 computer models. There were also hooks in the Model 4P&#x27;s ROM to boot from an ARCNET network.

Ethernet became much more attractive when it moved from co-axial cable to twisted pair and an &quot;interconnected stars&quot; cabling topology based on active hubs. Easier cabling, combined with the greater raw speed of Ethernet ( versus for ARCnet) helped to increase Ethernet&#x27;s demand. As more companies entered the market, the price of Ethernet started to fall while ARCNET and Token Ring volumes tapered off.

=== ARCnet Plus and decline ===
In response to greater bandwidth needs, and the challenge of Ethernet, a new standard called ARCnet Plus was developed by Datapoint and introduced in 1992. ARCnet Plus ran at and was backward-compatible with original ARCnet equipment. However, by the time ARCnet Plus products were ready for the market, Ethernet had captured the majority of the network market and there was little incentive for users to move back to ARCnet. As a result, very few ARCnet Plus products were ever produced. Those that were built, mainly by Datapoint, were expensive and hard to find.

ARCNET was eventually standardized as ANSI ARCNET 878.1. It appears this was when the name changed from ARCnet to ARCNET. Other companies entered the market, notably Standard Microsystems who produced systems based on a single VLSI chip, originally developed as custom LSI for Datapoint, but later made available by Standard Microsystems to other customers. Datapoint eventually found itself in financial trouble and moved into video conferencing then and later to custom programming in the embedded market.

Even though ARCNET is now rarely used for new general networks, the diminishing installed base still requires support and it retains a niche in industrial control.

== Description ==
Original ARCNET used RG-62/U coaxial cable of impedance and either passive or active hubs in a star-wired bus topology. At the time of its greatest popularity, this was a significant advantage of ARCNET over Ethernet. A star-wired bus was much easier to build, expand and maintain than the clumsy linear bus Ethernet of the time. The &quot;interconnected stars&quot; cabling topology made it easy to add and remove nodes without taking down the whole network, and much easier to diagnose and isolate failures within a complex LAN.

Another significant advantage ARCNET had over Ethernet was cable distance. ARCNET coax cable runs could extend between active hubs or between an active hub and an end node, while the RG-58 (50Ω) &#x27;thin&#x27; Ethernet most widely used at that time was limited to a maximum run of from end to end.

ARCNET had the disadvantage of requiring either an active or passive hub between nodes if there were more than two nodes in the network, while thin Ethernet allowed nodes to be spaced anywhere along the linear coax cable. However, ARCNET passive hubs were very inexpensive, being composed of a simple, small, unpowered box with four ports, wired together with nothing more than four discrete resistors, so the disadvantage was not significant. This disadvantage can also be seen as an advantage: often the cost of a 4 port ARCNET passive hub was less than the 4 BNC Tee connectors and 2 terminators that thin Ethernet requires to connect 4 computers. Unlike BNC Tee connectors that could sometimes be hard to obtain in the early days of Ethernet, an ARCNET passive hub could be easily manufactured in the field with 9 readily available parts: 4 connectors, 4 resistors and a box to put them in.

Passive hubs limited the distance between a node and an active hub to . A passive hub could not be connected directly to another passive hub. Unused ports on both types of hubs had to be terminated with a special connector. This special connector, called a terminator, is just a BNC connector with a 93 ohm resistor in it. Thin Ethernet also requires nearly identical terminators at the two terminal ends, the only difference being Ethernet uses a 50 ohm resistor.

To reduce costs while still allowing wide area coverage, a common practice was to use one or more interconnected active hubs, each of which provided coverage for nodes no more than away. Cable was run from each port of the active hubs to a different location no more than away. A passive hub would then be attached to the end of the cable, and cables would be run locally from the passive hub, allowing connection of up to three nodes. In this way, a single 8-port active hub could be used to connect 24 networked devices over an area not exceeding in diameter.

ARCNET allowed only 255 nodes per network. Node IDs for LAN workstations were typically set by DIP switches on the network interface card. Larger networks would have to be split into smaller networks, and bridged. The small number of possible nodes and the need to manually configure IDs was a disadvantage compared with Ethernet, particularly as large enterprise networks became common.

To mediate access to the bus, ARCNET, like Token Ring, uses a token passing scheme, rather than the carrier sense multiple access approach of Ethernet. When peers are inactive, a single &quot;token&quot; message is passed around the network from machine to machine and no peer is allowed to use the bus unless it has the token. If a particular peer wishes to send a message, it waits to receive the token, sends its message then passes the token on to the next station. Because ARCNET is implemented as a distributed star, the token cannot be passed machine to machine around a ring. Instead, each node is assigned an 8 bit address (usually via DIP switches), and when a new node joins the network a &quot;reconfig&quot; occurs, wherein each node learns the address of the node immediately above it. The token is then passed directly from one node to the next.
Historically, each approach had its advantages: ARCNET added a small delay on an inactive network as a sending station waited to receive the token, but Ethernet&#x27;s performance degraded drastically if too many peers attempted to broadcast at the same time, due to the time required for the slower processors of the day to process and recover from collisions. ARCNET had slightly lower best-case performance (viewed by a single stream), but was much more predictable. ARCNET also has the advantage that it achieved its best aggregate performance under the highest loading, approaching asymptotically its maximum throughput. While the best case performance was less than Ethernet, the general case was equivalent and the worst case was dramatically better. An Ethernet network could collapse when too busy due to excessive collisions. An ARCNET would keep on going at normal (or even better) throughput. Throughput on a multi-node collision-based Ethernet was limited to between 40% and 60% of bandwidth usage (depending on source). Although ARCNET could at one time outperform a Ethernet in a busy office on slow processors, ARCNET ultimately gave way to Ethernet as improved processor speeds reduced the impact of collisions on overall throughput, and Ethernet costs dropped. 

In the early 1980s, ARCNET was much cheaper than Ethernet, in particular for PCs. For example, in 1985 SMC sold ARCNET cards for around whilst an Ungermann-Bass Ethernet card plus transceiver could cost .

Another significant difference is that ARCNET provides the sender with a definite success/failure status of delivery at the receiver before the token passes on to the next node. This permits much faster fault recovery within the higher level protocols, rather than having to wait for a timeout on the expected replies. ARCNET also doesn&#x27;t waste network time transmitting to a node not ready to receive the message, since the initial hardware-level inquiry establishes that the recipient is able and ready to receive the larger message before it is sent across the bus.

One further advantage that ARCNET enjoyed over collision-based Ethernet is that it guarantees equitable access to the bus by everyone on the network. Although it takes a time to get the token depending on the number of nodes and the size of the messages currently being sent, a node will always receive it within a predictable maximum time. It is therefore &quot;deterministic&quot;. This made ARCNET an ideal real-time networking system, which explains its use in the embedded systems and process control markets. Token Ring has similar qualities, but is much more expensive to implement than ARCNET.

In spite of ARCNET&#x27;s deterministic operation and historic suitability for real-time environments such as process control, the general availability of switched gigabit Ethernet and Quality of service capabilities in Ethernet switches has all but eliminated ARCNET today.

At first the system was deployed using the RG-62/U coaxial cable commonly used in IBM mainframe environments to connect 3270 terminals and controllers, but later added support for twisted pair and fibre media. At ARCNET&#x27;s lower speeds (), Cat-3 cable is good enough to run ARCNET. Some ARCNET twisted-pair products supported cable runs over on standard Cat-3 cable, far beyond anything Ethernet could do on any kind of copper cable.

In the early 1990s, Thomas-Conrad Corporation developed a topology called TCNS based on the ARCNET protocol, which also supported RG-62, twisted-pair, and fiber optic media. TCNS enjoyed some success until the availability of lower-cost Ethernet put an end to the general deployment of ARCNET as a LAN protocol.

However, because of its simple and robust nature, ARCNET controllers are still sold and used in industrial, embedded, and automotive applications.

<text>Trinity Broads is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest north of Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, England. They are in The Broads Special Area of Conservation. They are also part of the Broads National Park in Norfolk, England, comprising five broads in total. The three largest are Rollesby Broad, Ormesby Broad and Filby Broad, and there are two much smaller broads named Lily Broad and Ormesby Little Broad. They are managed by the Broads Authority.

The Trinity Broads are on a tributary of the River Bure, but there is no navigable link to the main river system, and they are therefore virtually undisturbed.

==Water supply==
In 1995, most of the broads were bought by Essex and Suffolk Water, as a means of supplying water to Great Yarmouth. The quality of the water is good, and has been further protected by the construction of a sluice where Muck Fleet meets the River Bure. In order to meet their statutory requirements for conservation and recreation, ESW have formed a partnership with the Broads Authority, the Environment Agency and English Nature. A joint management plan has ensured that recreational use is maintained at a low level and the value of the broads as a wildlife habitat is retained. The level of water in Muck Fleet is lower than that of the River Bure, and water from the channel is pumped into the river by Stokesby pumping station, which is maintained by the internal drainage board.

A project to rectify poor water quality in Ormesby Broad began in 2010. Costing £120,000 over three years, the project involves pumping mud from the bottom of the lake. The mud is rich in nutrients, as a result of agricultural runoff, and removing it increases the capacity of the lake to store water, which is extracted as drinking water, as well as providing better habitat for reedbeds at the edges of the lake. Twelve lagoons were prepared to hold the mud until it dried, but initial archaeological investigation of the site for the lagoons revealed the presence of a Middle Bronze Age field system, the first such system found to the east of the Cambridgeshire Fens. The start of pumping was delayed while the site was investigated. Pumping began in March 2010, but was delayed again when live ammunition was sucked up in the mud, and became trapped in the pumps.

By mid-May, pumping had to stop, due to the rapid growth of aquatic plants. It resumed in August, and by early 2011, around had been removed. Once the mud had dried, the nutrients in it make it good for fertilising poor-quality soil, and it was ploughed in. When completed, around twice this volume of mud had been removed from the bottom of the broad.

==Recreation==

No motor boats are allowed onto the Trinity Broads, although rowing boats and dinghies are available for hire. Muck Fleet, which connects the broads to the River Bure, is too shallow even for such craft.

Besides sailing, the broads are also very popular with anglers. Recently, new facilities for disabled people have been created, including a special platform for anglers in wheelchairs. Ormesby Little Broad is used for sailing model yachts, and the Norfolk Model Yacht Club have an arrangement with Essex and Suffolk Water, which allows them to use the broad for this purpose once a month. Like their larger counterparts, the use of petrol or oil engines is not permitted, and all remote control is therefore by electric motors.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail. Muck Fleet is designated as &quot;heavily modified&quot;, which means that the channels have been altered by human activity, and the criteria for this designation are defined by the Water Framework Directive.

The water quality for Muck Fleet, which includes most of the broads, was as follows in 2019.
Reasons for the water quality being less than good include groundwater and surface water abstraction, physical modification of the channel, and runoff from agricultural and rural land. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) which had not previously been included in the assessment.

<doc id="99707" wikidata="Q36393" url="?curid=99707" title="Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung">
<text>Quotations from Chairman Mao (, commonly known as the &quot;红宝书&quot; during the Cultural Revolution), colloquially referred to in the English-speaking world as the Little Red Book, is a compilation book of quotations from speeches and writings by Mao Zedong (formerly romanized as Mao Tse-tung), the former chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, published from 1964 to 1979 and widely distributed during the Cultural Revolution.

== Publication process ==
&quot;Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung&quot; was originally compiled by an office of the &quot;PLA Daily&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Liberation Army Daily&quot;) as an inspirational political and military document. The initial publication covered 23 topics with 200 selected quotations by Mao, and was entitled &quot;200 Quotations from Chairman Mao&quot;. It was first given to delegates of a conference on 5 January 1964 who were asked to comment on it. In response to the views of the deputies and compilers of the book, the work was expanded to address 25 topics with 267 quotations, and the title was changed simply to &quot;Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung&quot;.

On 10 January, the work was re-issued to the delegates and sent to select units of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army who received their advance copies for educating troops as well as for their comments. In May 1964, the PLA General Political Department, the chief political organ under Central Military Commission, revised &quot;Quotations&quot;, adding a half title page with the slogan &quot;Workers of the world, unite!&quot; () in bold red letters, and endorsement leaves written by Lin Biao, Mao&#x27;s chosen successor, that included three lines from the diary of revolutionary soldier Lei Feng who is considered a hero in China. This version was issued &quot;for internal use&quot; to the military leaders. Following discussions that expanded the book twice more—finally closing on 33 topics and 427 quotations by Mao—the commission began publishing the definitive version in May 1965.

At the end of 1965, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party officially approved the book for publication by the People&#x27;s Publishing House and for distribution within China by the Xinhua Bookstore.

The Ministry of Culture held special study meetings to develop a production and distribution plan. It sought assurances that the book would receive publishing priority and that there would be sufficient paper, ink, and printing presses available. The goal was for &quot;ninety-nine percent (of the population of China to) read Chairman Mao&#x27;s book&quot;, according to a catalogue of publication records of the People&#x27;s Publishing House. Provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across China were ordered to build hundreds of new printing houses to publish the &quot;Quotations&quot; during the second half of 1966, which pushed the limits of the Chinese printing industry.

This disrupted plans for publishing any new volumes of &quot;The Complete Works of Marx and Engels&quot; that was already in progress. It also halted distribution of other ideological works. As late as 1970, more than 8 million copies of the 4-volume set of &quot;Selected Works of Marx and Engels&quot; that had already been printed (both in cloth hardcover and paperback) remained undistributed in storage warehouses on the grounds that other works &quot;should not interfere with learning &quot;Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung&quot;&quot;.

On the other hand, several other works by Mao had very large printings during the same period, even though these editions were not produced in the large numbers of &quot;Quotations from Chairman Mao&quot;. These include &quot;Selected Works of Mao Zedong&quot; (in four volumes, 2.875 million copies in 14 languages), &quot;Selected Articles of Mao Zedong&quot; (various editions totalling 252 million copies), single article books, and works of poetry.

On 12 February 1979, the Publicity Department of the Chinese Communist Party ordered a halt to publishing &quot;Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung&quot;.

=== Formats ===
Earlier versions and predecessors of the compilation book featured blue or white covers and sleeves.

The most widely produced editions of the &quot;Quotations of Chairman Mao&quot; were published with a printed red vinyl cover wrapper over cardboard with pages bound in 64 folios that included photos of Mao. Other editions of the book were covered in cloth, silk, leather, paper, and other materials.

Most editions were produced in a functional, compact size that fit into a pocket, were easy to carry, and could be taken out at any time &quot;for practice, learning, application.&quot; It was published in 32 other common sizes, allegedly the largest format printed on only four pages as large as the newspaper &quot;Reference News&quot;, and the smallest format the size of a matchbox.

== Content ==
&quot;Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung&quot; consists of 427 quotations, organized thematically into 33 chapters. It is also called &quot;Thoughts of Chairman Mao&quot; by many Chinese. The quotations range in length from a sentence to a few short paragraphs, and borrow heavily from a group of about two dozen documents in the four volumes of Mao&#x27;s &quot;Selected Works&quot;.

Usually the quotations are arranged logically, to deal with one to three themes in the development of a chapter. The table below summarizes the book.

== Distribution ==

The book was known as the &quot;Treasured Red Book&quot; () or &quot;Little Treasure Book&quot; in China. It has produced a wide array of sales and distribution figures. Some sources claim that over 6.5 billion printed volumes have been distributed in total, others contend that the distribution ran into the &quot;billions&quot;, and others cite &quot;over a billion&quot; official volumes between 1966 and 1969 alone as well as &quot;untold numbers of unofficial local reprints and unofficial translations.&quot;

The book&#x27;s popularity may be because it was essentially an unofficial requirement for every Chinese citizen to own, to read, and to carry it at all times during the latter half of Mao&#x27;s rule, especially during the Cultural Revolution.

=== Overseas ===
Outside China the work was called the &quot;Little Red Book&quot; due to the red cover of its most widely printed version.

In 1966, the Publicity Department of the Chinese Communist Party approved &quot;Quotations from Chairman Mao&quot; for export. To meet overseas requirements, the editors of the Chinese Foreign Languages Press made revisions necessitated by the situation. They added a &quot;second edition preface&quot; endorsement by Lin Biao, dated 16 December 1966 (which was torn out following Lin Biao&#x27;s death and public disgrace in September 1971). On the last page, they listed the names of the publisher (PLA General Political Department) without an ISBN, the printer and distributor (both Xinhua Bookstore), and the publication year.

By May 1967, bookstores in 117 countries and territories around the world—including the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Japan, the Soviet Union, West Germany, Italy, Nepal, Indonesia, Philippines, Burma, Iran, various Arab and African nations and others—were distributing Mao&#x27;s &quot;Quotations&quot;. Foreign presses operating in 20 countries contributed to the publication of 20 translations in 35 versions.

== Social impact ==

During the 1960s, the book was the single most visible icon in mainland China, even more visible than images of Mao himself. In posters and pictures created by CCP&#x27;s propaganda artists, nearly every painted character, whether smiling or looking determined, was seen with a copy of the book in his or her hand. During the Mao era, when people swore oaths they would often do so on &quot;Quotations&quot;. After the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976 and the rise of Deng Xiaoping in 1978, the importance of the book waned considerably, and the glorification of Mao&#x27;s quotations was considered to be left deviationism and a cult of personality.

&quot;Quotations&quot; continues to be a symbol of Mao Zedong Thought in China today. In certain situations, the book is given as a gift, for example, when public funds are involved, or when personal events arise, such as congratulating newlyweds.

Today in China, &quot;Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung&quot; is mostly seen as a piece of nostalgia. It is difficult to find in bookstores. Rare and unusual printings can command extremely high prices from collectors. A 1964 version of the book was sold for US$15,000 by Sotheby&#x27;s. It can be purchased at shops in Beijing, Shanghai, other major cities in China, as well as at some tourist attractions. The edition currently (2012) available (photo above) has a publication date of 1966. It has about thirty colour photographs at the front. There are then another 378 pages with Traditional Chinese on the left pages and the English translation on the right pages. The English language edition has many spelling mistakes as well as other typographical errors on almost every page. Only the first 22 chapters are in this edition compared with 33 in the first Chinese and English editions.

<text>Benjamin Montmorency &quot;Benmont&quot; Tench III (born September 7, 1953) is an American musician and singer, and a founding member of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.

==Early years==

Tench was born in Gainesville, Florida, the second child of Benjamin Montmorency Tench Jr. and Mary Catherine McInnis Tench. His father was born and raised in the city of Gainesville, and served as a circuit court judge.

Tench played piano from an early age. His first recital was at age six. After discovering the music of the Beatles, he ended his classical piano lessons and focused on rock and roll. At age 11, he met Tom Petty for the first time at a Gainesville music store. Petty and Tench played together as members of The Sundowners in 1964. The Tench family&#x27;s garage was a frequent practice site for the band.

==Education==
Tench attended Phillips Exeter Academy, and subsequently Tulane University in New Orleans. While on a college break, Tench went to a concert by Mudcrutch, Petty&#x27;s band, with an opening act from nearby Jacksonville, Lynyrd Skynyrd. Afterwards, he sat in with the band on several different sessions, then went back to school. Soon after, Petty called Tench and asked him to quit school and join Mudcrutch full-time, which after long deliberation, Tench agreed to; but before he would leave school, Petty had to convince Tench&#x27;s father that his son had a promising music career.

==Music career==
Mudcrutch eventually evolved into Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.

In addition to playing piano and Hammond organ with the Heartbreakers, Tench is also a session musician, having recorded with dozens of notable artists.

Songs written by Tench and recorded by other artists include &quot;You Little Thief&quot;, a top 5 UK and Australian hit for Feargal Sharkey in 1985, and &quot;Never Be You&quot; (co-written with Petty), which was featured on the &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; soundtrack album and became a #1 US Country hit for Rosanne Cash, also in 1985. Tench has received two ASCAP songwriting awards: in 1995 for &quot;Stay Forever&quot; (performed by Hal Ketchum) and in 2001 for &quot;Unbreakable Heart&quot; (performed by Jessica Andrews). This was also recorded by Carlene Carter in the early 1990s. He also wrote songs for Kimmie Rhodes (&quot;Play Me A Memory&quot;) and Lone Justice (&quot;Sweet, Sweet Baby (I&#x27;m Falling)&quot;).

==Other bands and solo career==
In 2008, Tench became part of a supergroup, initially named the Scrolls, now officially known as Works Progress Administration (W.P.A.). The band is composed of Tench, Sean Watkins (guitar), Sara Watkins (fiddle), Glen Phillips (guitar, vocals), Luke Bulla (fiddle), Greg Leisz (various), Pete Thomas (drums), and Davey Faragher (bass). The group released a self-titled album in September 2009. Tench penned one of the songs on the album, named &quot;The Price,&quot; sung by Sara Watkins and himself. A fan of the Replacements, he would join them on stage.

Tench has worked extensively with other musicians, playing keyboards on hundreds of songs on albums such as Stevie Nicks&#x27; &quot;Bella Donna&quot;, Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Shot of Love&quot;, along with Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, Alanis Morissette, Eurythmics, Fiona Apple, U2, X, and he is featured on &quot;Depending on You&quot; on the Rolling Stones&#x27;s album &quot;Hackney Diamonds&quot;, among many more.

In 2009, Tench frequently appeared with the Watkins Family Hour at Largo at the Coronet in Los Angeles. He has also appeared at the Largo and at the Fillmore in San Francisco as a special guest with Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, and accompanied the Dave Rawlings Machine on part of their west coast tour in spring 2010. In 2015, the Watkins Family Hour released their debut album and went on a national tour.

In 2014, Tench released his first solo album, titled &quot;You Should Be So Lucky&quot;. Tench also added keyboard parts to Stevie Nicks&#x27; album &quot;24 Karat Gold: Songs from the Vault&quot;.

In 2016, Tench played the Fleetwood Mac tribute at the Fonda Theater, in Los Angeles; he performed the song &quot;Silver Springs&quot; with Courtney Love. Tench also appears on the bill for a tribute to the band Big Star that took place in Los Angeles, California, in April 2016 (together with members of R.E.M, Wilco and Semisonic).
Tench also reunited with Mudcrutch to record the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Mudcrutch 2&quot;. The band embarked on their American tour on May 26, 2016.

In March 2019, Tench played three shows with Phil Lesh &amp; Friends at the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, New York. He also played on three songs from the Who&#x27;s album &quot;WHO&quot;, released in December 2019.

==Recognition==
In 2024, Neil McCormick of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ranked Tench as the third greatest keyboard player of all time, calling him &quot;the King of the Hammond in the contemporary rock era&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1991, Tench married Canadian model Courtney Taylor. They divorced in late 1999. In 2015, Tench married his second wife, author Alice Carbone Tench. Their daughter was born on December 16, 2017.

<text>Arsphenamine, also known as Salvarsan or compound 606, is an antibiotic drug that was introduced at the beginning of the 1910s as the first effective treatment for the deadly infectious diseases syphilis, relapsing fever, and African trypanosomiasis.
This organoarsenic compound was the first modern antimicrobial agent.

==History==
Arsphenamine was first synthesized in 1907 in Paul Ehrlich&#x27;s lab by Alfred Bertheim. The antisyphilitic activity of this compound was discovered by Sahachiro Hata in 1909, during a survey of hundreds of newly synthesized organic arsenical compounds. Ehrlich had theorized that by screening many compounds, a drug could be discovered that would have anti-microbial activity but not kill the human patient. Ehrlich&#x27;s team began their search for such a &quot;magic bullet&quot; among chemical derivatives of the dangerously toxic drug atoxyl.

Arsphenamine was used to treat the disease syphilis because it is toxic to the bacterium &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot;, a spirochete that causes syphilis.

Arsphenamine was originally called &quot;606&quot; because it was the sixth in the sixth group of compounds synthesized for testing; it was marketed by Hoechst AG under the trade name &quot;Salvarsan&quot; in 1910. Salvarsan was the first organic antisyphilitic, and a great improvement over the inorganic mercury compounds that had been used previously. It was distributed as a yellow, crystalline, hygroscopic powder that was highly unstable in air. This significantly complicated administration, as the drug had to be dissolved in several hundred milliliters of distilled, sterile water with minimal exposure to air to produce a solution suitable for injection. Some of the side effects attributed to Salvarsan, including rashes, liver damage, and risks of life and limb, were thought to be caused by improper handling and administration. This caused Ehrlich, who worked assiduously to standardize practices, to observe, &quot;the step from the laboratory to the patient&#x27;s bedside ... is extraordinarily arduous and fraught with danger.&quot;

Ehrlich&#x27;s laboratory developed a more soluble (but slightly less effective) arsenical compound, Neosalvarsan (neoarsphenamine), which was easier to prepare, and it became available in 1912. Less severe side-effects such as nausea and vomiting were still common. An additional problem was that both Salvarsan and Neosalvarsan had to be stored in sealed vials under a nitrogen atmosphere to prevent oxidation. These arsenical compounds were supplanted as treatments for syphilis in the 1940s by penicillin.

After leaving Ehrlich&#x27;s laboratory, Hata continued parallel investigation of the new medicines in Japan.

==Structure==
Salvarsan has long been assumed to have an As=As double bond, akin to the N=N linkage in azobenzene. However, in 2005, in an extensive mass spectrometric analysis, the arsenic–arsenic bonds in Salvarsan were shown to be single bonds rather than double bonds. Presumed to consist of RAs=AsR molecules, i.e. (RAs)2, Salvarsan was found to actually contain a mixture of cyclo-(RAs)3 and cyclo-(RAs)5 species, where R is the 3-amino-4-hydroxyphenyl moiety. According to Nicholson, these cyclic species slowly release an oxidised species, RAs(OH)2, that is likely responsible for Salvarsan&#x27;s antisyphilis properties.

<text>Brian Robert Setzer (born April 10, 1959) is an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter. He found widespread success in the early 1980s with the 1950s-style rockabilly group Stray Cats, and returned to the music scene in the early 1990s with his swing revival band, the Brian Setzer Orchestra. In 1987, he made a cameo appearance as Eddie Cochran in the film &quot;La Bamba&quot;.

In February 2025, Setzer shared that he has an autoimmune disease which prevents him from playing guitar.
==Career==

===Stray Cats===

Setzer was born April 1959 in Massapequa, New York. He started on the euphonium and played in jazz bands when he was in school. He found a way to hear jazz at the Village Vanguard, though as he got older he became more interested in rock, punk, and rockabilly. He was a member of the Bloodless Pharaohs and the Tomcats, which he began with his brother, Gary. The Tomcats became the Stray Cats when double bassist Lee Rocker and drummer Slim Jim Phantom joined and Gary left the band. In 1980, thinking they might have more success in England than in America, they sold their instruments to pay for airplane tickets and flew to London.

After performing in London for a few months, they met Dave Edmunds, a guitarist and record producer who shared their love of rockabilly and 1950s&#x27; rock and roll. Edmunds produced their debut album, &quot;Stray Cats&quot; (Arista, 1981), which yielded two hit singles: &quot;Stray Cat Strut&quot; and &quot;Rock This Town&quot;. The second album, &quot;Gonna Ball&quot; (Arista, 1982), was less successful. The band returned to America and released &quot;Built for Speed&quot; (EMI, 1982), produced again by Dave Edmunds, with songs collected from their first two albums. Helped by their music videos on MTV, the Stray Cats became popular in America. Their next album, &quot;Rant n&#x27; Rave with the Stray Cats&quot; (EMI, 1983) produced the hit &quot;(She&#x27;s) Sexy + 17&quot;.

The Stray Cats disbanded in 1984, though they occasionally reunited, recorded, and toured. After recording three albums with different producers, they returned to Dave Edmunds for &quot;Choo Choo Hot Fish&quot; (1992).

===Solo career/The Brian Setzer Orchestra===
After the Stray Cats disbanded in 1984, Setzer began a solo career that included working as a sideman for other acts, such as the Honeydrippers led by Robert Plant. On his first solo album, &quot;The Knife Feels Like Justice&quot; (EMI, 1986), he turned away from rockabilly and moved toward rhythm and blues (R&amp;B) and the heartland rock of John Mellencamp. The album was produced by Don Gehman and featured Kenny Aronoff on drums. Both men had worked on albums by Mellencamp. His second studio album &quot;Live Nude Guitars&quot; followed in 1988. While this album retained some heartland rock elements, it found Setzer moving in more of a straight-ahead blues rock direction, comparable to George Thorogood&#x27;s style; Setzer served as co-producer along with Larson Paine, Chris Thomas and David A. Stewart. He went on tour with Thorogood later that year.

Setzer returned to his love of music from the 1950s, this time the jump blues of Louis Prima. Whereas he had resurrected rockabilly in the 1980s, he resuscitated swing in the 1990s. He assembled the Brian Setzer Orchestra, a seventeen piece big band that got the public&#x27;s attention with a cover version of Prima&#x27;s &quot;Jump, Jive an&#x27; Wail&quot; from the album &quot;The Dirty Boogie&quot; (Interscope, 1998). The song won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, while &quot;Sleep Walk&quot; from the same album won the Grammy for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.

The album &quot;Wolfgang&#x27;s Big Night Out&quot; (2007) featured Setzer&#x27;s interpretation of classical pieces, such as Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 5&quot; and &quot;Für Elise&quot;. &quot;Wolfgang&quot; earned Setzer his eighth Grammy nomination, this time for Best Classical Crossover Album.

He executive produced the album &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; (Surfdog, 2014) by Drake Bell and played guitar on two songs.

On June 25, 2021, Setzer announced a new solo album, his first in 7 years, titled &quot;Gotta Have the Rumble&quot;.

==Personal life==
Setzer has been married 
three times, most recently in 2005 to Julie Reiten, a former singer with the Dustbunnies, and lives in Minneapolis.

In February 2025, Setzer revealed that he has an autoimmune disease which prevents him from playing guitar.

<text>Wallonia ( ; ; or ), officially the Walloon Region ( ; ), is one of the three regions of Belgium—along with Flanders and Brussels. Covering the southern portion of the country, Wallonia is primarily French-speaking. It accounts for 55% of Belgium&#x27;s territory, but only a third of its population. The Walloon Region and the French Community of Belgium, which is the political entity responsible for matters related mainly to culture and education, are independent concepts, because the French Community of Belgium encompasses both Wallonia and the bilingual Brussels-Capital Region but not the German-speaking Community of Belgium, which administers nine municipalities in Eastern Wallonia.

During the Industrial Revolution, Wallonia was second only to the United Kingdom in industrialization, capitalizing on its extensive deposits of coal and iron. This brought the region wealth, and from the beginning of the 19th to the middle of the 20th century, Wallonia was the more prosperous half of Belgium. Since World War II, the importance of heavy industry has greatly diminished, and the Flemish Region has exceeded Wallonia in wealth as Wallonia has declined economically. Wallonia now suffers from high unemployment and has a significantly lower GDP per capita than Flanders. The economic inequalities and linguistic divide between the two are major sources of political conflicts in Belgium and a major factor in Flemish separatism.

The capital of Wallonia is Namur, and the most populous city is Charleroi. Most of Wallonia&#x27;s major cities and two-thirds of its population lie along the east–west aligned Sambre and Meuse valley, the former industrial backbone of Belgium. To the north of this valley, Wallonia lies on the Central Belgian Plateau, which, like Flanders, is a relatively flat and agriculturally fertile area. The south and southeast of Wallonia is made up of the Ardennes, an expanse of forested highland that is less densely populated.

There is a German-speaking minority in eastern Wallonia, resulting from the annexation of three cantons previously part of the German Empire at the conclusion of World War I. This community represents less than 1% of the Belgian population. It forms the German-speaking Community of Belgium, which has its own government and parliament for culture-related issues.

Wallonia borders Flanders and the Netherlands (the province of Limburg) in the north, France (Grand Est and Hauts-de-France) to the south and west, and Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate) and Luxembourg (Capellen, Clervaux, Esch-sur-Alzette, Redange and Wiltz) to the east. Wallonia has been a member of the since 1980.

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;Wallonia&quot; can mean slightly different things in different contexts. One of the three federal regions of Belgium is still constitutionally defined as the &quot;Walloon Region&quot; as opposed to &quot;Wallonia&quot;, but the latter has been adopted by the regional government and is in common use. Prior to 2010, when the renaming came into effect, &quot;Wallonia&quot; could sometimes refer to the territory governed by the Walloon Region, whereas &quot;Walloon Region&quot; referred specifically to the government. In practice, the difference between the two terms is small and what is meant is usually clear, based on context.

&quot;Wallonia&quot; is a cognate of terms such as Wales, Cornwall and Wallachia. The Germanic word Walha, meaning &quot;the strangers&quot;, referred to Gallic or Celtic people. Wallonia is named after the Walloons, a group of locals who natively speak Romance languages. In Middle Dutch (and French), the term &quot;Walloons&quot; included both historical secular Walloon principalities, as well as the French-speaking population of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège or the whole population of the Romanic sprachraum within the medieval Low Countries.

== History ==


Julius Caesar conquered Gaul in 57 BC. The Low Countries became part of the larger Gallia Belgica province which originally stretched from southwestern Germany to Normandy and the southern part of the Netherlands. The population of this territory was Celtic with a Germanic influence which was stronger in the north than in the south of the province. Gallia Belgica became progressively romanized. The ancestors of the Walloons became Gallo-Romans and were called the &quot;Walha&quot; by their Germanic neighbours. The &quot;Walha&quot; abandoned their Celtic dialects and started to speak Vulgar Latin.

The Merovingian Franks gradually gained control of the region during the 5th century, under Clovis. Due to the fragmentation of the former Roman Empire, Vulgar Latin regionally developed along different lines and evolved into several &quot;langue d&#x27;oïl&quot; dialects, which in Wallonia became Picard, Walloon and Lorrain. The oldest surviving text written in a &quot;langue d&#x27;oïl&quot;, the &quot;Sequence of Saint Eulalia&quot;, has characteristics of these three languages and was likely written in or very near to what is now Wallonia around 880 AD. From the 4th to the 7th century, the Franks established several settlements, probably mostly in the north of the province where the romanization was less advanced and some Germanic trace was still present. The language border (that now splits Belgium in the middle) began to crystallize between 700 under the reign of the Merovingians and Carolingians and around 1000 after the Ottonian Renaissance. French-speaking cities, with Liège as the largest one, appeared along the Meuse, while Gallo-Roman cities such as Tongeren, Maastricht and Aachen became Germanized.

The Carolingian dynasty dethroned the Merovingians in the 8th century. In 843, the Treaty of Verdun gave the territory of present-day Wallonia to Middle Francia, which would shortly fragment, with the region passing to Lotharingia. On Lotharingia&#x27;s breakup in 959, the present-day territory of Belgium became part of Lower Lotharingia, which then fragmented into rival principalities and duchies by 1190. Literary Latin, which was taught in schools, lost its hegemony during the 13th century and was replaced by Old French.

In the 15th century, the Dukes of Burgundy took over the Low Countries. The death of Charles the Bold in 1477 raised the issue of succession, and the Liégeois took advantage of this to regain some of their autonomy. From the 16th to the 18th century, the Low Countries were governed successively by the Habsburg dynasty of Spain (from the early 16th century until 1713–14) and later by Austria (until 1794). This territory was enlarged in 1521–22 when Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor gained the Tournai region from France.

Present-day Belgium was conquered in 1795 by the French Republic during the French Revolutionary Wars. It was annexed to the Republic, which later became the Napoleonic Empire. After the Battle of Waterloo, Wallonia became part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands under King William of Orange. The Walloons played an active part in the Belgian Revolution in 1830. The Provisional Government of Belgium proclaimed Belgium&#x27;s independence and held elections for the National Congress.

===Belgian period===
In the 19th century, the area began to industrialize, and Wallonia was the first fully industrialized area in continental Europe. This brought the region great economic prosperity, which was not mirrored in poorer Flanders and the result was a large amount of Flemish immigration to Wallonia. Belgium was divided into two divergent communities. On the one hand, the very Catholic Flemish society was characterized by an economy centred on agriculture; on the other hand, Wallonia was the centre of the continental European Industrial Revolution, where classical liberal and socialist movements were rapidly emerging. Major strikes and general strikes took place in Wallonia, including the Walloon jacquerie of 1886, the Belgian general strikes of 1893, 1902, 1913 (for universal suffrage), 1932 (depicted in &quot;Misère au Borinage&quot;), and 1936. After World War II, major strikes included the general strike against Leopold III of Belgium (1950), and the 1960-1961 Winter General Strike for autonomy for Wallonia.

The profitability of the heavy industries to which Wallonia owed its prosperity started declining in the first half of the 20th century, and the centre of industrial activity shifted north to Flanders. The loss of prosperity caused social unrest, and Wallonia sought greater autonomy in order to address its economic problems. In the wake of the 1960-1961 Winter General Strike, the process of state reform in Belgium got underway. This reform started partly with the linguistic laws of 1962–63, which defined the four language areas within the constitution. But the strikes of 1960 which took place in Wallonia more than in Flanders are not principally linked with the four language areas nor with the Communities but with the Regions. In 1968, the conflict between the communities burst out. French speakers in Flanders (who were not necessarily Walloons) were driven out of, most notably the Leuven-based Catholic University amid shouts of &quot;&quot;Walen buiten&quot;!&quot; (&quot;Walloons out!&quot;). After a formal split of the university in two and the creation of a brand new campus in Wallonia, a wider series of State reforms was passed in Belgium, which resulted in the federalisation of the nation and the creation of the Walloon Region and the French Community (comprising both Wallonia and Brussels), administrative entities each of which would gain various levels of considerable autonomy.

== Geography ==
Wallonia is landlocked, with an area of , or 55 percent of the total area of Belgium. The Sambre and Meuse valley, from Liège () to Charleroi () is an entrenched river in a fault line which separates Middle Belgium (elevation ) and High Belgium (). This fault line corresponds to a part of the southern coast of the late London-Brabant Massif. The valley, along with Haine and Vesdre valleys form the &quot;sillon industriel&quot;, the historical centre of the Belgian coalmining and steelmaking industry, and is also called the Walloon industrial backbone. Due to their long industrial historic record, several segments of the valley have received specific names: Borinage, around Mons, le Centre, around La Louvière, the Pays noir, around Charleroi and the Basse-Sambre, near Namur.

To the north of the Sambre and Meuse valley lies the Central Belgian plateau, which is characterized by intensive agriculture. The Walloon part of this plateau is traditionally divided into several regions: Walloon Brabant around Nivelles, Western Hainaut (, around Tournai), and Hesbaye around Waremme. South of the sillon industriel, the land is more rugged and is characterized by more extensive farming. It is traditionally divided into the regions of Entre-Sambre-et-Meuse, Condroz, Fagne-Famenne, the Ardennes and Land of Herve, as well as the Belgian Lorraine around Arlon and Virton. Dividing it into Condroz, Famenne, Calestienne, Ardennes (including Thiérache), and Belgian Lorraine (which includes the Gaume) is more reflective of the physical geography. The larger region, the Ardennes, is a thickly forested plateau with caves and small gorges. It is host to much of Belgium&#x27;s wildlife but little agricultural capacity. This area extends westward into France and eastward to the Eifel in Germany via the High Fens plateau, on which the Signal de Botrange forms the highest point in Belgium at 694 metres (2,277 ft).
== Subdivisions ==
The Walloon region covers and is divided into five provinces, 20 arrondissements and 262 cities or municipalities.

The province of Walloon Brabant is the most recent one, being formed in 1995 after the splitting of the province of Brabant.


=== Cities ===
The largest cities in Wallonia are:
* Charleroi (204,146)
* Liège (195,790)
* Namur (110,428)
* Mons (92,529)
* La Louvière (81,138)
* Tournai (69,792)

==Science and technology==

Contributions to the development of science and technology have appeared since the beginning of the country&#x27;s history. The baptismal font of Renier de Huy is not the only example of medieval Walloon technical expertise: the words &quot;houille&quot; (coal) or &quot;houilleur&quot; (coal miner) or &quot;grisou&quot; (damp) were coined in Wallonia and are Walloon in origin.

The economically important very deep coal mining in the course of the First Industrial Revolution has required highly reputed specialized studies for mining engineers. But that was already the case before the Industrial Revolution, with an engineer as Rennequin Sualem for instance.

Engineer Zenobe Gramme invented the Gramme dynamo, the first generator to produce power on a commercial scale for industry. Chemist Ernest Solvay gave his name to the Solvay process for production of soda ash, an important chemical for many industrial uses. Ernest Solvay also acted as a major philanthropist and gave its name to the Solvay Institute of Sociology, the Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management and the International Solvay Institutes for Physics and Chemistry which are now part of the Université libre de Bruxelles. In 1911, he started a series of conferences, the Solvay Conferences on Physics and Chemistry, which have had a deep impact on the evolution of quantum physics and chemistry.

Georges Lemaître of the Université catholique de Louvain is credited with proposing the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe in 1927.

Three Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine were awarded to Walloons: Jules Bordet (Université libre de Bruxelles) in 1919, Albert Claude (ULB) together with Christian De Duve (UCLouvain) in 1974.

In the present day, Bureau Greisch has acquired an international reputation as consulting engineer and architect in the fields of structures, civil engineering and buildings, including the Millau Viaduct in France.

== Economy ==

Wallonia is rich in iron and coal, and these resources and related industries have played an important role in its history. In ancient times, the Sambre and Meuse valley was an important industrial area in the Roman Empire. In the Middle Ages, Wallonia became a center for brass working and bronze working, with Huy, Dinant and Chimay being important regional centers. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the iron masters of Liège developed a method of refining iron ore by the use of a blast furnace, called the Walloon Method. There were also a few coal mines around Charleroi and the Borinage during this period, but their output was small, and was principally consumed as fuel by various industries such as the important glassmaking industry that sprang up in the Charleroi basin during the 14th century.

In the 19th century, the area began to industrialize, mainly along the so-called sillon industriel. It was the first fully industrialized area in continental Europe, and Wallonia was the second industrial power in the world, in proportion to its population and its territory, after the United Kingdom. The sole industrial centre in Belgium outside the collieries and blast furnaces of Wallonia was the historic cloth making town of Ghent.

The two World Wars curbed the continuous expansion that Wallonia had enjoyed up till that time. Towards the end of the 1950s, things began to change dramatically. The factories of Wallonia were by then antiquated, the coal was running out and the cost of extracting coal was constantly rising. It was the end of an era, and Wallonia has been making efforts to redefine itself. The restoration of economical development is high on the political agenda, and the government is encouraging development of industries, notably in cutting-edge technology and in business parks. The economy is improving, but Wallonia is not yet at the level of Flanders and is still suffering from difficulties.
The current Walloon economy is relatively diversified, although certain areas (especially around Charleroi and Liège) are still suffering from the steel industry crisis, with an unemployment rate of up to 30 percent. Nonetheless, Wallonia has some companies which are world leaders in their specialized fields, including armaments, glass production, lime and limestone production, cyclotrons and aviation parts. The south of Wallonia, bordering Luxembourg, benefits from its neighbour&#x27;s economic prosperity, with many Belgians working on the other side of the border; they are often called &quot;frontaliers&quot;. The Ardennes area south of the Meuse is a popular tourist destination for its nature and outdoor sports, in addition to its cultural heritage, with places such as Bastogne, Dinant, Durbuy, and the famous hot springs of Spa.

The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 105.7 billion € in 2018, accounting for 23% of Belgian economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €25,700 or 85% of the EU27 average in the same year.

==Politics and government==


Belgium is a federal state made up of three communities and three regions, each with considerable autonomy. One of these is the Walloon Region, which is governed by the Parliament of Wallonia and the executive Government of Wallonia. The Walloon Region&#x27;s autonomy extends even to foreign policy; Wallonia is entitled to pursue its own foreign policy, including the signing of treaties, and in many domains, even the Belgian federal government is not able to sign an international treaty without the agreement of the Parliament of Wallonia.

Wallonia is also home to about 80 per cent of the population of the French Community of Belgium, a political level responsible for matters related mainly to culture and education, with the remainder living in Brussels. Wallonia is also home to the small German-speaking Community of Belgium in the east, which has its own government and parliament for culture-related issues. Although in Flanders, the Flemish Region assigned all of its powers to the Flemish Community, the Walloon Region remains in principle distinct from and independent from the French Community, and vice versa. Despite this, the French Community&#x27;s parliament is almost entirely composed of members of Wallonia&#x27;s and Brussels&#x27; parliaments, so the bodies are governed by the same individuals. Additionally, the French Community of Belgium has controversially begun referring to itself exclusively as the &#x27;Wallonia-Brussels Federation&#x27; to emphasize the links between the French Community, Wallonia and Brussels.

The Walloon Region has a unicameral parliament with 75 members elected for five years by direct universal suffrage, and an executive, the Government of Wallonia, elected by a political majority in Parliament. The Government has nine members with the president. Each member is called a &quot;Walloon minister&quot;. The head of the Government is called the Minister-President of Wallonia. The coalition government for the 2014–2019 legislature was a centre-left coalition PS-cdH until July 28 when it was replaced by a centre-left coalition MR-cdH. The current Minister-President is Elio Di Rupo.

===History of Walloon autonomy===

Following several state reforms, especially the 1993 state reform, Belgium became a federal state made up of three communities and three regions, with Wallonia being represented by the Walloon Region and its two language communities. The directly elected Walloon Parliament was created in June 1995, replacing the &quot;Conseil régional wallon&quot; (Regional Council of Wallonia). The first Council had sat on 15 October 1980 and was composed of members of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives and the Belgian Senate elected in Wallonia.

===Political landscape===
Wallonia is considered to be left-wing politically, in contrast to Flanders, which is more right-wing. The region has been described as one of the few places in Europe without a significant right-wing populism presence. In Wallonia, there is a cordon sanitaire in the media, where far-right politicians are banned from interviews and live appearances. The ban has also affected more mainstream right-wing parties such as the N-VA.

==Symbols==

The first appearance of the French word &quot;Wallonie&quot; as a reference to the romance world as opposed to Germany is said to date from 1842. Two years later, it was first used to refer to the Romance part of the young country of Belgium. In 1886, the writer and Walloon militant Albert Mockel, first used the word with a political meaning of cultural and regional affirmation, in opposition with the word &quot;Flanders&quot; used by the Flemish Movement. The word had previously appeared in German and Latin as early as the 17th century.

The rising of a Walloon identity led the Walloon Movement to choose different symbols representing Wallonia. The main symbol is the &quot;bold rooster&quot; (), also named &quot;Walloon rooster&quot; (, ), which is widely used, particularly on arms and flags. The rooster was chosen as an emblem by the Walloon Assembly on 20 April 1913, and designed by Pierre Paulus on 3 July 1913. The Flag of Wallonia features the red rooster on a yellow background.

An anthem, (&quot;The Walloons&#x27; Song&quot;), written by Theophile Bovy in 1900 and composed by Louis Hillier in 1901, was also adopted. On September 21, 1913, the &quot;national&quot; feast day of Wallonia took place for the first time in Verviers, commemorating the participation of Walloons during the Belgian Revolution of 1830. It is held annually on the third Sunday of September. The Assembly also chose a motto for Wallonia, &quot;Walloon Forever&quot; (), and a cry, &quot;Liberty&quot; (). In 1998, the Walloon Parliament made all these symbols official except the motto and the cry.

==Religion==
The population of Wallonia is predominantly of Christian heritage. In 2016, 68% of residents of Wallonia declared themselves to be Roman Catholic (21% were practising Catholics and 47% were non-practising), 3% were Muslim, 3% were Protestant Christian, 1% were of other religions and 25% were non-religious.
==Languages==

=== Official languages ===
French is the official language of Wallonia and by far the most used; in the East Cantons, German is also official. The German-speaking Community of Belgium accounts for about 2% of the region&#x27;s population. Belgian French, which is also spoken in the Brussels-Capital Region, is similar to that spoken in France, with slight differences in pronunciation and some vocabulary differences, notably the use of the words &quot;septante&quot; (70) and &quot;nonante&quot; (90), as opposed to &quot;soixante-dix&quot; and &quot;quatre-vingt-dix&quot; in France.

There are noticeable Walloon accents, with the accent from Liège and its surroundings being perhaps the most striking. Other regions of Wallonia also have characteristic accents, often linked to the regional language.

=== Regional languages ===
Walloons traditionally also speak regional Romance languages, all from the &quot;Langues d&#x27;oïl&quot; group. Wallonia includes almost all of the area where Walloon is spoken, a Picard zone corresponding to the major part of the Hainaut Province, the Gaume (district of Virton) with the Lorrain language and a Champenois zone. There are also regional Germanic languages, such as the Luxembourgish language in Arelerland (Land of Arlon). The regional languages of Wallonia are more important than in France, and they have been officially recognized by the government. With the development of education in French, however, these dialects have been in continual decline. There is currently an effort to revive Walloon dialects; some schools offer language courses in Walloon, and Walloon is also spoken in some radio programmes, but this effort remains very limited.

== Culture ==

===Literature===
====In Walloon====
Literature is written principally in French but also in Walloon and other regional languages, colloquially called Walloon literature. Walloon literature (regional language not French) has been printed since the 16th century. But it did have its golden age, paradoxically, during the peak of the Flemish immigration to Wallonia in the 19th century: &quot;That period saw an efflorescence of Walloon literature, plays and poems primarily, and the founding of many theaters and periodicals.&quot; 

The New York Public Library possesses a surprisingly large collection of literary works in Walloon, quite possibly the largest outside Belgium, and its holding are representative of the output. Out of nearly a thousand, twenty-six were published before 1880. Thereafter the numbers rise gradually year by year, reaching a peak of sixty-nine in 1903, and then they fall again, down to eleven in 1913. See &#x27;Switching Languages&#x27;, p. 153. Yves Quairiaux counted 4800 plays for 1860–1914, published or not. In this period plays were almost the only popular show in Wallonia. But this theater remains popular in the present-day Wallonia: Theater is still flourishing, with over 200 non-professional companies playing in the cities and villages of Wallonia for an audience of over 200,000 each year. 

There are links between French literature and (the very small) Walloon literature. For instance Raymond Queneau set Editions Gallimard the publication of a Walloon Poets&#x27; anthology. Ubu roi was translated in Walloon by André Blavier, a 
Verviers
pataphysician, for the new and important Puppets theater of Liège of Jacques Ancion, the Al Botroûle theater &quot;at the umbilical cord&quot; in Walloon indicating a desire to return to the source (according to Joan Cross). But Jacques Ancion wanted to develop a regular adult audience. From the 19th century, he included the Walloon play &quot;Tati l&#x27;Pèriquî&quot; by E.Remouchamps and the avant-garde &quot;Ubu roi&quot; by A.Jarry. 

For Jean-Marie Klinkenberg, &quot;the dialectal culture is no more a sign of attachment to the past but a way to participate to a new synthesis&quot;.

====In French====
Jean-Marie Klinkenberg (member of the Groupe μ) wrote that Wallonia, and literature in Wallonia, has been present in French language since its formation. 

In their &#x27;Histoire illustrée des lettres française de Belgique&#x27;, Charlier and Hanse (editors), La Renaissance du livre, Bruxelles, 1958, published 247 pages (on 655 ), about the &quot;French&quot; literature in the Walloon provinces (or Walloon principalities of the Middle-Age, sometimes also Flemish provinces and principalities), for a period from the 11th to the 18th century. Among the works or the authors, the Sequence of Saint Eulalia (9th century), La Vie de Saint Léger (10th century), Jean Froissart (14th century in the County of Hainaut), Jean d&#x27;Outremeuse, Jean Lebel, Jean Lemaire de Belges (16th century from Bavay), the Prince of Ligne (18th century, Beloeil). There is a Walloon Surrealism, especially in Hainaut Province. Charles Plisnier (1896–1952), born in Mons, won the Prix Goncourt in 1936, for his novel &quot;Mariages&quot; and for &quot;Faux Passeports&quot; (short stories denouncing Stalinism, in the same spirit as Arthur Koestler). He was the first foreigner to receive this honour. The Walloon Georges Simenon is likely the most widely read French-speaking writer in the world, according to the Tribune de Genève. More than 500 million of his books have been sold, and they have been translated into 55 languages. There is a link between the Jean Louvet&#x27;s work and the social issues in Wallonia.

====In Picard====
Picard is spoken in Hainaut Province of western Belgium. Notable Belgian authors who wrote in Picard include Géo Libbrecht, Paul Mahieu, Paul André, Francis Couvreur and Florian Duc.
=== Mosan art, painting, architecture ===
Mosan art is a regional style of Romanesque art from the Meuse river valley in present-day Wallonia, and the Rhineland, with manuscript illumination, metalwork, and enamel work from the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries. Among them is the masterpiece of Renier de Huy and perhaps of the whole Mosan art Baptismal font at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, Liège. The architecture of Roman churches of Wallonia are also named mosan, exemplified by the Collegiate Church of Saint Gertrude in Nivelles, and the churches of Waha and Hastière, Dinant. The Ornamental brassware is also a part of the Mosan art and among these dinandiers Hugo d&#x27;Oignies and Nicholas of Verdun.
Jacques du Broeucq was a sculptor of the 16th century.

Flemish art was not confined to the boundaries of modern Flanders and several leading artists came from or worked in areas in which langues d&#x27;oïl were spoken, from the region of modern Wallonia, e.g. Robert Campin, Rogier van der Weyden (Rogier de la Pasture) and Jacques Daret. Joachim Patinir Henri Blès are generally called mosan painters. Lambert Lombard (Liège, 1505 – 1566) was a Renaissance painter, architect and theorist for the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. Gérard de Lairesse, Bertholet Flemalle were also important painters in the Prince-Bishopric of Liège.

Gustave Serrurier-Bovy (Liège, 1858 – Antwerp, 1910) architect and furniture designer, credited (along with Paul Hankar, Victor Horta and Henry van de Velde) with creating the Art Nouveau style, coined as a style in Paris by Bing. 

George Grard (1901—1984) was a Walloon sculptor, known above all for his representations of the female, in the manner of Pierre Renoir and Aristide Maillol, modelled in clay or plaster, and cast in bronze.

During the 19th and 20th centuries many original romantic, expressionist and surrealist Wallon painters emerged, including Félicien Rops, Paul Delvaux, Pierre Paulus, Fernand Verhaegen, Antoine Wiertz, René Magritte ... The avant-garde CoBrA movement appeared in the 1950s.

===Music===

There was an important musical life in Prince-Bishopric of Liège since the beginning. Between 1370 and 1468, a school of music flourished in Liège, notably producing Johannes Brassart and Johannes Ciconia (the third Master of Ars Nova).

The vocal music of the so-called Franco-Flemish School developed in the southern part of the Low Countries and was an important contribution to Renaissance culture. Robert Wangermée and Philippe Mercier wrote in their encyclopedic book about the Walloon music that Liège, Cambrai and Hainaut Province played a leading part in the so-called Franco-Flemish School.

Among them were Orlande de Lassus, Gilles Binchois, Guillaume Dufay In the 19th and 20th centuries, there was an emergence of major violinists, such as Henri Vieuxtemps, Eugène Ysaÿe (author of the unique opera in Walloon during the 20th century &quot;Piére li houyeû&quot; – Pierre the miner – based on a real incident which occurred in 1877 during a miners&#x27; strike in the Liège region), and Arthur Grumiaux, while Adolphe Sax (born in Dinant) invented the saxophone in 1846. The composer César Franck was born in Liège in 1822, Guillaume Lekeu in Verviers. More recently, André Souris (1899–1970) was associated with Surrealism. Zap Mama is a more international group.

Henri Pousseur is generally regarded as a member of the Darmstadt School in the 1950s. Pousseur&#x27;s music employs serialism, mobile forms, and aleatory, often mediating between or among seemingly irreconcilable styles, such as those of Schubert and Webern (&quot;Votre Faust&quot;), or Pousseur&#x27;s own serial style and the protest song &quot;We shall overcome&quot; (&quot;Couleurs croisées&quot;). He was strongly linked to the social strikes in Liège during the 1960s. He worked also with the French writer Michel Butor.

=== Cinema ===

Walloon films are often characterized by social realism. It is perhaps the reason why the documentary &quot;Misère au Borinage&quot;, and especially its co-director Henri Storck, is considered by Robert Stallaerts as the father of the Walloon cinema. He wrote: &quot;Although a Fleming, he can be called the father of the Walloon cinema&quot;. For F. André between &quot;Misère au Borinage&quot; and the films like those of the Dardenne brothers (since 1979), there is &quot;Déjà s&#x27;envole la fleur maigre&quot; (1960) (also shot in the Borinage), a film regarded as a point of reference in the history of the cinema. On the other hand, films such as Thierry Zéno&#x27;s &quot;Vase de noces&quot; (1974), &quot;Mireille in the life of the others&quot; by Jean-Marie Buchet (1979), &quot;C&#x27;est arrivé près de chez vous&quot; (English title: &quot;Man bites dog&quot;) by Rémy Belvaux and André Bonzel (1992) and the works of Noël Godin and Jean-Jacques Rousseau are influenced by surrealism, absurdism and black comedy. The films of the Dardenne brothers are also inspired by the Bible and &quot;Le Fils&quot; for instance is regarded as one of the most spiritually significant films.

===Festivals===

The Ducasse de Mons (Walloon French for Kermesse), is one of the UNESCO Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. It comprises two important parts: the procession, the descent and the ascent of the shrine of Waltrude, and the combat between Saint George and the dragon. The combat (after the procession), plays out on the Trinity Sunday between 12:30 pm and 1:00 pm on the Mons&#x27;s central square. It represents the fight between Saint George (the good) and the dragon (the evil). The dragon is a mannequin carried and moved by the &quot;white men&quot; (&quot;fr:Hommes blancs&quot;). The dragon fights Saint George by attacking with his tail. Saint George on his horse turns clockwise and the dragon turns in the other direction. Saint George finally kills the dragon.

The Gilles of Binche and the giants&#x27; procession in Ath are also UNESCO Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

===Cuisine===

Wallonia is famous for a number of different foods and drinks, a great many of which are specialties of certain cities or regions. The Liège waffle a rich, dense, sweet, and chewy waffle native to Liège, is the most popular type of waffle in Belgium, and can be found in stores and even vending machines throughout the country. Cougnou, or the &quot;bread of Jesus&quot;, is a sweet bread typically eaten around Christmas time and found throughout the region.

Other specialties include Herve cheese, an apple butter called &quot;sirop de Liège&quot;, the Garden strawberry of Wépion. Also notable is the Dinant specialty Flamiche: These cheese tarts are not found in window displays as they are meant to be eaten straight from the oven. As one restaurateur stated in a book about Walloon gastronomy &quot;it is the client who waits for the flamiche, as the flamiche does not wait for the client&quot;. There are also the Ardennes ham, the &quot;tarte al djote&quot; from Nivelles, a dessert pie made with beet leaves and cheese, while tarte au riz is a rice-pudding filled pie from Verviers. The Walloons of the Door Peninsula in Wisconsin have a tradition of making what is called a Belgian Pie but which is a flat pie more like a pizza covered with prune purée and topped with a thin cheese layer. These were made by the dozens in outdoor stone ovens for the many kermisses, in a tradition that dates back to immigration in the 1850s.

A signature Walloon sausage is called Belgian Trippe among the Walloon community of Northeastern Wisconsin on the Door Peninsula. It is a blend of pork and cabbage made differently from household to household and probably based on a traditional Walloon sausage such as Boudin Verte d&#x27;Orp. Cussette is a fresh cheese which gets its airborne &quot;P. roqueforti&quot; culture from a tradition of making it in the kitchen. This is aged only one week at 30 degrees C, until it develops a faint blue cast and a tang. Walloon headcheese differs from the German in that it is more finely ground, includes bits of cartilage, and is allowed to sit for a month or two in a cool place before being eaten.

In terms of drink, Wallonia mirrors Belgium as a whole; beer and wine are both popular, and a great diversity of beers are made and enjoyed in Wallonia. Installed in Bierghes in the Senne valley, the Gueuzerie Tilquin is the only gueuze blendery in Wallonia. Wallonia boasts three of the seven Trappist beers (from Chimay, Orval and Rochefort) in addition to a great number of other locally brewed beers. Wallonia is also home to the last bastion of traditional rustic &quot;saison&quot;, most notably those produced at the Brasserie de Silly and the Brasserie Dupont (located in Tourpes, in the region of Western Hainaut Province historically known for its production of rustic farmhouse ales). Jupiler, the best-selling beer in Belgium, is brewed in Jupille-sur-Meuse in Liège. Wallonia also home to a Jenever called Peket, and a May wine called Maitrank.

==Transportation==

=== Airports ===
The two largest cities in Wallonia each have an airport. The Brussels South Charleroi Airport has become an important passenger airport, especially with low fares companies such as Ryanair or Wizzair. It serves as a low-cost alternative to Brussels Airport, and it saw 7 303 720 passengers in 2016. The Liège Airport is specialized in freight, although it also operates tourist-oriented charter flights. Today, Liège is the 8th airport for European freight and aims to reach the 5th rank in the next decade.

=== Railways, motorways, buses ===
TEC is the single public transit authority for all of Wallonia, operating buses and trams. Charleroi is the sole Walloon city to have a metro system, the Charleroi Pre-metro.

Wallonia has an extensive and well-developed rail network, served by the Belgian National Railway Company, SNCB.

Wallonia&#x27;s numerous motorways fall within the scope of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T). This priority programme run by the European Union provides more than 70,000 km of transport infrastructure, including motorways, express rail lines and roadways, and has been developed to carry substantial volumes of traffic.

=== Waterways ===
With traffic of over 20 million tonnes and 26 kilometres of quays, the autonomous port of Liège (PAL) is the third largest inland port in Europe. It carries out the management of 31 ports along the Meuse and the Albert Canal. It is accessible to sea and river transporters weighing up to 2,500 tonnes, and to push two-barge convoys (4,500 tonnes, soon to be raised to 9,000 tonnes). Even if Wallonia does not have direct access to the sea, it is very well connected to the major ports thanks to an extensive network of navigable waterways that pervades Belgium, and it has effective river connections to Antwerp, Rotterdam and Dunkirk.

On the west side of Wallonia, in Hainaut Province, the Strépy-Thieu boat lift, permits river traffic of up to the new 1350-tonne standard to pass between the waterways of the Meuse and Scheldt rivers. Completed in 2002 at an estimated cost of €160 million (then 6.4 billion Belgian francs) the lift has increased river traffic from 256 kT in 2001 to 2,295 kT in 2006.

==International relations==
===Trade===
The Walloon Export and Foreign Investment Agency (AWEX) is the Wallonia Region of Belgium&#x27;s government agency in charge of foreign trade promotion and foreign investment attraction.

The AWEX organizes regular trade missions to the promising market of Kazakhstan, where it has a representative office in Almaty. In 2017, the AWEX together with the Flanders Investment and Trade brought a delegation of 30 companies to Astana and Almaty, the two largest cities in Kazakhstan.

<text>The Call is an American rock band formed in Santa Cruz, California, in 1980. The main lineup consisted of members Michael Been, Scott Musick, Tom Ferrier, and Jim Goodwin. The band released nine studio albums over the next two decades before disbanding in 2000. Their 1986 song, &quot;I Still Believe (Great Design)&quot;, was covered by Tim Cappello and included in the 1987 film &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;. The band also achieved significant success in 1989 with &quot;Let the Day Begin&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; U.S. Mainstream Rock chart and was later used as a campaign theme song for Al Gore&#x27;s 2000 Presidential Campaign.

==Formation and early career==
The Call&#x27;s original lineup was Been (lead vocals, guitar), Musick (drums, percussion), Ferrier (guitar), and Greg Freeman (bass). This lineup grew to include Steve Huddleston on keyboards from 1981 through 1983. Goodwin joined the band as keyboardist in 1983, replacing Huddleston. Freeman departed in 1984, and Joe Read (of Strapps, The Textones, and Code Blue) took over bass duties on &quot;Scene Beyond Dreams&quot;. Both originally from Oklahoma, Been and Musick didn&#x27;t meet until moving independently to California. The Call were earlier known as Airtight and then Motion Pictures, serving as Phil Seymour&#x27;s band at that time. A version of the John Prine/Phil Spector song &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Want My Love&quot; with Phil backed by The Call was released on the 2020 album &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Want My Love&quot; as part of the Phil Seymour archive series.

Beginning with their 1982 self-titled debut, they went on to produce and release nine studio albums by 2000. The Call recorded its eponymous premiere album in England and Been recalled in a 1987 interview that the band was in an exploratory phase at this point. He further noted, &quot;&quot;The Call&quot; was a compassionate album, but it probably came out as anger.&quot; Peter Gabriel liked the band so much that he called them the &quot;future of American music&quot; and asked them to open for him during his 1982–1983 &quot;Plays Live&quot; tour.

The Call&#x27;s next album, &quot;Modern Romans&quot;, was notable for its political content. Been later stated, &quot;There was a great deal happening politically — Grenada, Lebanon, or the government saying the Russians are evil and the Russian government probably saying the same about us. That kind of thinking inspired me to write the last lines of &#x27;[The] Walls Came Down&#x27;.&quot; Garth Hudson of the Band played keyboards on these first two records.

This was followed by &quot;Scene Beyond Dreams&quot;, which Been referred to as The Call&#x27;s &quot;metaphysical&quot; album. With a strong poetic sense to the lyrics and a change in musical style, the change in sound is notable.

== Commercial hits and extended break ==

The Call recorded their next album, &quot;Reconciled&quot;, in mid-1985. By this point, Been had begun performing the bass guitar parts himself. Before this, the band had not been under a recording contract for two years due to what Been described as &quot;legal bickering&quot; between The Call&#x27;s former record label, Mercury, and their management company.&quot; However, when the band signed a new deal with Elektra Records, The Call produced their most commercially successful album to date. Peter Gabriel, Simple Minds&#x27; Jim Kerr, Hudson, and Hudson&#x27;s Band bandmate Robbie Robertson all performed as guests on the album, which Elektra released in 1986. Several tracks from the album became hits on the Mainstream Rock Chart, with one of these tracks, &quot;I Still Believe (Great Design)&quot; (also known simply as &quot;I Still Believe&quot;), appearing on the soundtrack of the 1986 film &quot;The Whoopee Boys&quot;.

The following year, Tim Cappello covered &quot;I Still Believe&quot; for the film &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;. In the film, Cappello memorably stole the scene as a muscular bare-chested, oiled-up saxophonist belting out the tune on the beach. Contemporary Christian musician Russ Taff also covered the song on his 1987 self-titled album. More recently the Protomen covered the song on their 2015 cover album &quot;The Cover Up&quot;. In 2017, Klayton from Celldweller covered &quot;Too Many Tears&quot; on &quot;Offworld&quot;. In 2018, a cover version of &quot;I Still Believe&quot; appeared in the Paramount Pictures television series &quot;Waco&quot; about the Branch Davidian tragedy. In 2022, &quot;I Still Believe&quot; also featured prominently in the last episode of the second season of the TV show &quot;Reservation Dogs&quot;, which included a cameo by Cappello playing the saxophone.

The band released &quot;Into the Woods&quot; in 1987, which Been referred to as his favorite album. In 1989, they released &quot;Let the Day Begin&quot;, whose title track reached No. 1 on the US Mainstream Rock chart. Their label under-ordered physical copies of the album and the resultant decline in sales limited their chart position.

The Call released &quot;Red Moon&quot;, their final studio album for a major label, in 1990. The album included background vocals by U2&#x27;s Bono on the track &quot;What&#x27;s Happened to You&quot;. The album took a turn into the then-rising genre of Americana and was out of step with the shock of grunge music taking over the airwaves. Following the &quot;Red Moon&quot; tour, the band took an &quot;extended break&quot;.

== Reunion and legacy ==

Been&#x27;s solo releases in the early 1990s, including the song &quot;To Feel This Way&quot; for the 1992 film &quot;Light Sleeper&quot; and the 1994 solo album &quot;On the Verge of a Nervous Breakthrough&quot; fueled rumors about the band&#x27;s dissolution. However, in 1996, Warner Bros. Records. released &quot;The Best of The Call&quot;, which featured a selection of old favorites and a few new songs, including full-band re-recordings of Been&#x27;s solo songs &quot;Us&quot; and &quot;To Feel This Way&quot;.

In 1997, they released a new studio album, &quot;To Heaven and Back&quot;, on Fingerprint Records. A few years later, a music fan tracked Been down and helped him master a recording from their 1990 tour, leading to the release of their first live album, &quot;Live Under the Red Moon&quot;, in 2000 on the indie label Conspiracy Music. The band disbanded that same year.

Al Gore used &quot;Let the Day Begin&quot; as his campaign song in the 2000 U.S. Presidential Election and Tom Vilsack used it as his song during his brief 2008 U.S. Presidential Election campaign.

In 2009, the Oklahoma History Center held a temporary exhibition titled &quot;Another Hot Oklahoma Night: A Rock &amp; Roll Exhibit&quot;, which presented the state&#x27;s contribution to the history of rock music. The exhibition derived its name from a line in The Call&#x27;s song &quot;Oklahoma&quot;, which was also one of the ten finalists in a 2009 vote for Oklahoma&#x27;s official state rock song. A book of the same name was published that featured The Call and other Oklahoma musicians.

Michael Been died on August 19, 2010, after suffering a heart attack backstage at the Pukkelpop music festival in Hasselt, Belgium, where he was working as the sound engineer for his son&#x27;s, Robert Levon Been, band Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, also known as BRMC.

On April 18 and 19, 2013, band members Scott Musick, Tom Ferrier and Jim Goodwin reunited for a series of shows in San Francisco and Los Angeles with BRMC&#x27;s Robert Levon Been taking over bass and lead vocal duties. &quot;A Tribute to Michael Been featuring Robert Levon Been (of BRMC)&quot; was released on September 2, 2014, and featured songs recorded during those two 2013 shows. The CD version included 14 songs, while the special CD/DVD combo pack and a digital deluxe version featured 19 songs. The band also released the set on limited-edition vinyl. In 2015, an hour-long TV special using footage from the DVD was shown on VH1 Classic and Palladia.

On April 22, 2017, The Call reunited and played a show in New Orleans, Louisiana, at Siberia, with special guest vocalists Ray Ganucheau, Michael Divita, and J.D. Buhl.

On August 28, 2021, The Call was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame. Scott Musick and Steve Huddleston were present to accept their awards, and Michael Been&#x27;s sister accepted his posthumous award on his behalf.

In 2023, the remaining band members (Tom Ferrier, Jim Goodwin, and Scott Musick, along with Ralph Patlan) went back to the archives and discovered some live recordings and nearly complete studio tracks featuring Michael Been&#x27;s voice. They resolved to go back into the studio to finish off these recordings and issue them on a brand new studio album, &quot;The Lost Tapes&quot;, set to be released in 2024. &quot;The Lost Tapes&quot; is a new studio album of tracks from prior sessions which were never released. All of these newly finished recordings feature Michael Been, Jim Goodwin, Tom Ferrier and Scott Musick. The album will also include several rarities from 1978–1981 when the band was known as Airtight and Motion Pictures. The remastered versions of &quot;Reconciled&quot; and &quot;Into The Woods&quot; are also set for release.

On January 26, 2024, the band released the first new single &quot;Welcome To My World&quot; from The Lost Tapes on Spotify and all other digital services worldwide.

<text>Ranworth Broad is a nature reserve on the Norfolk Broads north-east of Norwich in Norfolk, United Kingdom. It is managed by the Norfolk Wildlife Trust. it is part of Bure Broads and Marshes Site of Special Scientific Interest and Bure Marshes Nature Conservation Review site, Grade I and National Nature Reverse. It is also part of the Broadland Ramsar site and Special Protection Area, and The Broads Special Area of Conservation.

Many species of birds can be seen from the floating Broads Wildlife Centre such as great crested grebes, wigeons, gadwalls, kingfishers and cormorants. There are also areas of woodland and reedbeds.

The poet and critic Edward Thomas spent a holiday on a houseboat on Ranworth Broad with his son and a group of friends in the summer of 1913 at the invitation of the poet and writer Eleanor Farjeon, while Thomas&#x27;s wife Helen was in Switzerland.

<text>Barton Broad is a large lake that forms part of the River Ant which gives its name to a nature reserve north-east of Norwich in Norfolk. The reserve is owned and managed by the Norfolk Wildlife Trust. It is part of the Ant Broads and Marshes Site of Special Scientific Interest and National Nature Reserve, and part of it is in the Ant Marshes Nature Conservation Review site, Grade I. It is part of the Broadland Ramsar site and Special Protection Area, and The Broads Special Area of Conservation.

==History==
During the 13th and 14th centuries, large quantities of peat were extracted in Norfolk, and most of the peat extraction was organised by the monks of St Benet&#x27;s Abbey, the ruins of which are located on the bank of the River Bure, a short distance downstream from its junction with the River Ant. Barton Broad was created in this way in the Middle Ages, and the River Ant was diverted through the peat workings in around 1730, to allow navigation. The activity of the monks was forgotten, but in 1834 Samuel Woodward suggested that the broads might be artificial, rather than naturally occurring features, after studies of Barton Broad. However, this idea was not generally accepted, and the artificial nature of the Broads was not clearly understood until the 1960s. Because of its connection to the North Sea at Great Yarmouth through the River Ant and the River Bure, Barton Broad is slightly tidal, although the water level only varies by about . The Broad provides habitat for a diverse collection of aquatic plants and fish, and the surrounding fens have nationally rare plants and invertebrates.

It is believed that Lord Nelson learnt to sail on Barton Broad prior to joining the navy when he was aged 12. The broad was owned by his sister at the time. There are several staithes connected to the broad by channels, including Catfield Wood End staithe to the east and Old Lime Kiln Dyke which ends at a staithe at Neatishead to the west. Britain&#x27;s first solar powered passenger boat, called &quot;Ra&quot;, operated from Neatishead staithe.

Photographs taken in the late-19th and early-20th centuries show that water quality at the time was good, supporting large lily beds with reed swamp fringing the banks of the broad. In the 1800s, the broad consisted of of open water, surrounded by of reed swamp. Conditions then deteriorated, with the clear water becoming cloudy and lifeless, while only small clumps of reed swamp remained around the edges. The water was clogged with mud and algae, and algal blooms contained toxins which could be fatal to farm animals and domestic pets. The beautiful Pleasure Island, in the middle of the Broad, became degraded as the reeds which protected it from wash created by boats and from wind-generated waves died back, resulting in the banks being scoured away. The Broad continued to be used by leisure boats, and was also the home of the Nancy Oldfield Trust, a group which helped people with limited mobility to experience the joys of sailing. They recorded the steady decline in water quality and in the depth of water, and by 1985 there was only of reed swamp left.

There were two main causes of this decline. The growth of population led to the construction of municipal sewage treatment works, which discharged treated effluent containing high concentrations of phosphorus into the rivers. The first was at North Walsham, which commenced operation in 1924. Agricultural practices used high volumes of fertilisers, and resulted in nitrogen leaching into the water. These two chemicals resulted in phytoplankton proliferating. Up to one million of these minute algae, only 10 microns across, could be found in every cubic centimetre of water, starving the native plants of light, and then settling on the bottom of the Broad when they died, reducing the depth of water available for navigation. A survey to assess the size of the problem found that for sailing boats with keels, there was only a narrow central strip of water with sufficient depth, and even that contained shallow spots. The bottom of the Broad was covered in thick black silt topped with a thicker layer of oozy sludge.

===Remediation===
Those responsible for the Broads decided that a programme of works to rectify the situation needed to be carried out. There would be four parts to the process, which would involve a substantial reduction in the amount of phosphorus discharged into the river system, a similar reduction in the amount of nitrogen entering the waterways, the removal of large volumes of sediment containing these chemicals from the Broad, and some bio-manipulation of the water.

Anglian Water operated two main sewage treatment works that affected Barton Broad, at Stalham and North Walsham. At Stalham they installed tertiary treatment in 1977, and a phosphate-stripping plant in 1982, to remove phosphorus from the treated effluent. At North Walsham, the effluent was diverted away from the river in 1980, and carried by pipeline to be discharged into the North Sea. This resulted in a step change in the levels of phosphorus found in the water. To reduce nitrogen levels, local farmers were given advice about how to use chemicals more responsibly through an education programme. Responsibility for the Broads changed in 1988, when they became a National Park, and the Broads Authority was set up in 1989 to manage the park. The cost of removing huge volumes of contaminated sludge was significant, but an application was made to the National Lottery&#x27;s Millennium Commission, as the restoration of wetland habitat seems a good fit to the requirements of that fund. The scheme was called the Barton Broad Clear Water 2000 project, and the bid was successful when £1.2 million was awarded to the Broads Authority. This was supplemented by £200,000 from the Soap and Detergent Industry Association, and £1.5 million from the Broads Navigation Committee.

A series of lagoons were created on nearby agricultural land, and a suction dredger was used to pump sludge from the bottom of the Broad through a floating pipeline to the lagoons. The volume of sludge would gradually reduce to about one third of its size through drying and shrinkage. The lagoons covered , and eventually held some of silt. This operation started in November 1995 and was completed in August 2000. During this period, Anglian Water installed DynaSand filters at Stalham sewage treatment works, to further reduce levels of phosphorus. Once the sludge had dried out, it was covered with the original top soil from the site, and the land was returned to agriculture.

The fourth stage used bio-manipulation, a process developed by the Broads Authority and the Environment Agency. This uses daphnia, commonly known as water fleas, which naturally filter water and remove bacteria and algae from it. However, they are usually eaten by small fish at a faster rate than they can remove the algae. To overcome this problem, pike and perch were introduced to the Broad, and significantly reduced the numbers of small fish, allowing the daphnia to thrive. This process could not be applied to the whole lake, and so controlled areas were created, separated from the body of the Broad by butyl rubber skirts, attached to a floation collar at the top and a weighted collar at the bottom to act as a seal onto the bed of the lake. Gauze filters at intervals along the skirts allowed water to pass between controlled and non-controlled areas, but prevented the passage of fish. Pleasure Island was reconstructed using gabions filled with stone pebbles to rebuild the edge of the island, which were covered in coir matting planted with reed-swamp flowers. The surface of the island was built up with dredgings topped with peat, and planted with wild flowers.
There is public access to the Barton Broad reserve. The Millennium Commission grant was conditional on public access being improved, and a number of boardwalks were created to allow pedestrians to view and enjoy the broad and nature reserve. The Clear Water 2000 project also included funding for an electric boat and charging shed, but by the time it was purchased, the design had changed a little, and the boat had a roof covered in solar cells to recharge the batteries. The boat was named &quot;Ra&quot;, and the facilities provided for it on shore were fully compliant with the access for all legislation, enabling wheelchair users to use them and to access the boat. A second boat, the &quot;Electric Eel&quot;, offered trips along the narrow channels at the edge of the Broad, and canoes can be used to investigate the really narrow connecting waterways. Norfolk Wherries are again able to enter the Broad because of its increased depth, and it is possible to hire one, including a skipper and a cook for a leisurely cruise. Both &quot;Ra&quot; and &quot;Electric Eel&quot; have since moved to other locations.

<text>Hickling Broad is a nature reserve 4 km south-east of Stalham, north-east of Norwich in Norfolk. It is managed by the Norfolk Wildlife Trust. It is a National Nature Reserve and part of the Upper Thurne Broads and Marshes Site of Special Scientific Interest and Hickling Broad and Horsey Mere Nature Conservation Review site, Grade I. It is in the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and part of the Broadland Ramsar site and Special Protection Area, and The Broads Special Area of Conservation.

It is the broad with the largest surface area, and the water is slightly brackish, due to its proximity to the sea. The navigation channel is only 1.5 m deep, with much of the broad being shallower; it is 1.4 km2, making it one of the largest expanses of open water in East Anglia.

==Ecology==
It has the largest reed-bed in England and supports rare waterweeds such as the holly-leaved naiad and three rare species of stonewort. Amongst the rare insects is the Swallowtail butterfly, subspecies &quot;Papilio machaon brittanicus&quot; which feeds on milk-parsley (&quot;Peucedanum palustre&quot;), the Norfolk hawker &quot;Aeshna isosceles&quot; and Emperor dragonfly. Birds that visit the reserve during the winter include cranes, common goldeneyes, shovelers and teals, while Eurasian bitterns, marsh harriers, common pochards, water rails and Cetti&#x27;s warblers stay for most of the year. There is a waymarked walk around the broad.

==Sea planes==

Hickling Broad was used as reserve station for sea planes by the RNAS, in the period 1916–1918, as an escape for RNAS South Denes. It was known as RNAS Hickling Broad. Contractors started building a concrete slipway, but this was never completed. Eventually, Hickling was only used for two emergency landings. A separate arrangement allowed seaplanes destined for Great Yarmouth to land on the calmer waters of the broad if the sea were too rough (this arrangement stands to this day). RNAS South Denes was located in the area which is now the South Denes Camping and Caravan site. There is a commemorative Blue plaque in Regent Street in Great Yarmouth, it reads &quot;Headquarters of the Royal Naval Air Service Occupied these premises during WWI April 1913-November 1918 Flying land &amp; sea planes from South Denes, Hickling Broad[s] [sic], and heavily involved in anti Zeppelin warfare.&quot;

<doc id="99735" wikidata="Q339733" url="?curid=99735" title="Norbert Zongo">
<text>Norbert Zongo (31 July 1949 – 13 December 1998), also known under the pen name Henri Segbo or H.S., was a Burkinabé investigative journalist who managed the newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Indépendant&quot; in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Under Zongo&#x27;s supervision, &quot;L&#x27;Indépendant&quot; exposed extortion and impunity within the government of Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaoré. He was assassinated after his newspaper began investigating the murder of a driver who had worked for the brother of Compaoré.

== Early life and education ==
Norbert Zongo was born in the Koudougou region, French Upper Volta on 31 July 1949 into the Gnougnoossi family, a prominent subset of the Mossi people. While in secondary school in 1964, he created a newspaper, &quot;La Voix du Cours Normal&quot;, writing bulletins on his exercise sheets with information gleaned from morning broadcasts from Radio France Internationale, BBC World Service, and other international radio stations. School officials eventually banned his publication after it discussed political topics. After high school, Zongo pursued legal studies at University of Abidjan in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and journalism at the University of Benin in Togo. The latter university expelled him and he was imprisoned in Burkina Faso after he published his political novel &quot;Le Parachutage&quot;. He was able to finish his education in journalism at the University of Yaoundé in Cameroon.

Zongo was a supporter of human rights and also helped found the Movement for Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights, an organization in Burkina Faso.

Norbert Zongo&#x27;s remains are buried in Gounghin Military Cemetery located just West of Ouagadougou.

== Career ==
In 1971, Norbert Zongo began his career as a teacher in Ouagadougou, Kadiogo Province.

Zongo was also a writer. His first novel &quot;Le Parachutage&quot; was a thinly disguised political critique of Togo&#x27;s President Gnassingbé Eyadema set in the post-colonial era. In the preface of the novel in 1988, Zongo mentions being arrested and beaten for writing it. He followed this novel with the colonial setting for &quot;Rougbêinga&quot; two years later, which was also political satire of leadership.

In 1991, Zongo, after working for the national daily paper &quot;Sidwaya&quot;, founded &quot;La Clef&quot; with Saturnin Ki. It was the first newspaper in Burkina Faso to openly criticism the government, with Zongo contributing under the pseudonym Henri Sebgo (or H.S.). The paper folded in 1993. That June, Zongo founded the weekly &quot;L&#x27;Indépendant&quot;, which primarily covered government corruption. In 1996, he began investigating a series of fraud and graft cases involving several mining and manufacturing companies with ties to top political officials and President Blaise Compaoré&#x27;s family. His resulting work severely embarrassed the government. The following year, Zongo directly criticized the Parliament&#x27;s decision to amend the Constitution to allow Compaoré to seek a third term.

== Disappearance and murder ==

In December 1997, a suspicious disappearance and possible murder of David Ouedraogo, the driver of François Compaoré (President Blaise Campaoré&#x27;s brother), prompted Zongo to investigate. Ouedrago was tortured and killed for allegedly stealing large sums of money. Zongo reported the case and wrote small excerpts every week for his newspaper. He began getting death threats and the government ignored them. His wife, Genevieve Zongo, confirmed that he was receiving death threats from 1997 to his death in 1998. She was told that Norbert would often be followed by a car while on his motorbike. Zongo was also approached to convince him to drop his investigation, but he continued until his death.

On December 13, 1998, four bodies were found shot and burned in a Toyota Land cruiser on the side of the road in Sapouy, Ziro Province. The remains were identified as Norbert Zongo; Zongo&#x27;s brother Yembi Ernest Zongo; Blaise Ilboudo, a colleague; and Abdouleye Ablassé Nikiema, who was Zongo&#x27;s driver. Zongo&#x27;s death triggered a national crisis and violent protests within Burkina Faso.

In January 1999, François Compaoré was charged with murder and harboring the body of the victim in connection with the death of Ouedraogo. The charges were later dropped by a military tribunal after François Compaoré appealed against them.

Six presidential body guards were identified as suspects in the murder. In August 2000, five members of the presidential security were charged for the murder of Ouedraogo. Marcel Kafando, Edmond Koama and Ousseini Yaro, who are also suspects in the Norbert Zongo case, were convicted and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. Edmond Koama died on January 4, 2001. Marcel Kafando was the only one who was charged for the crime, but the charges were later dropped on July 19, 2006. Marcel Kafando died three years later, in 2009. The judgment was called &quot;scandalous&quot; by Reporters Without Borders.

Businessman , who had also been implicated in documents brought forward by Reporters Without Borders, died in October 2011.

In 2013, the case was appealed for the family to have justice for their loss under a court system that was not under control of Burkina Faso. It was believed by the African Court on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights that Burkina Faso&#x27;s government covered up the case and violated the revised treaty of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) which allows freedom of expression and journalism. The ACHPR determined that the case should be reopened in order for the victim&#x27;s families to be compensated for their losses.

== Impact ==

During his funeral, about 20,000 people walked from the mortuary to the cemetery to pay tribute to him and solidarity with his cause. In 2006, Zongo&#x27;s case was determined closed with no one found guilty, which enraged civil rights defenders and citizens of Burkino Faso.

Norbert Zongo&#x27;s widowed wife, Genevieve continued to keep his newspaper, the &quot;L&#x27;Indépendant&quot;, alive after his death. She remains the primary publisher and editor in memory of her late husband.

In 2014, it was determined that Norbert Zongo&#x27;s case was unfairly excused due to a bias in government.

On the morning of October 29, 2017, François Compaoré was arrested at Roissy-Charles-de-Gaulle airport, based on a May 2017 international arrest warrant. A French ministerial decree authorized the extradition of Compaoré in March 2020. However, the extradition was suspended in 2021 by the European Court of Human Rights. Subsequently, in the aftermath of the 2022 coup, on December 13, 2023, France made the 2020 ministerial decree obsolete.

== Reactions ==
The Committee to Protect Journalists&#x27; Africa program coordinator, Sue Valentine, stated &quot;We praise Burkinabe authorities for taking this step (arresting three presidential soldiers involved in Zongo&#x27;s murder) and call on them to ensure that the mastermind of this murder is identified and prosecuted. After 17 long years, the family, friends, and colleagues of Norbert Zongo deserve a thorough and transparent investigation leading to full justice.&quot;

Reporters Without Borders&#x27; head of its Africa desk, Cléa Kahn-Sriber, said, &quot;This ruling constitutes a major turning-point in the Zongo case, which has suffered appallingly from the impunity tolerated for all these years by Burkina Faso&#x27;s justice system.&quot;

Reporters Without Borders, who avidly campaigned for Zongo&#x27;s case, stated, &quot;This has always been a highly political case. Zongo was killed by members of the presidential guard. François Compaoré, the brother of President Blaise Compaoré, is implicated. The authorities never stopped protecting the killers. The president has got what he always wanted – injustice.&quot;

The Independent Commission of Inquiry released the following statement: &quot;Norbert Zongo was assassinated for purely political motives because he practiced investigative journalism. He defended a democratic ideal and had chosen to become involved, with his newspaper, in the struggle for the respect of human rights and justice, and against the poor management of the public sector and impunity.&quot;

== Legacy and commemoration ==
Many Burkinabé journalists accredit Zongo with being the first writer in the country to practice investigative journalism.

* The singer Alpha Blondy wrote a song, &quot;Journalistes en danger&quot;, about the assassination of Zongo.
* In 2012, a memorial was erected at the Highway N6 (Ouagadougou – Léo) near Sapouy, at the site of his murder.
* In 2017, the public university of Koudougou changed its name to Norbert Zongo University.

==Awards==
In 2001 Zongo was posthumously given the Integrity Award for his work to expose government corruption.

<text>In Hinduism, the Maruts (; ), also known as the Marutagana and sometimes identified with [[Rudras]], are storm deities and sons of Rudra and Prisni. The number of Maruts varies from 27 to sixty (three times sixty in RV 8.96.8). They are very violent and aggressive, described as armed with golden weapons i.e. lightning and thunderbolts, as having iron teeth and roaring like lions, as residing in the northwest, as riding in golden chariots drawn by ruddy horses.

In the Vedic mythology, the Maruts act as Indra&#x27;s companions as a troop of young warriors. According to French comparative mythologist Georges Dumézil, they are cognate to the Einherjar and the Wild hunt.

== In mythology == 
Hymn 66 of Mandala VI of the Rig Veda, the ancient collection of sacred hymns, is an eloquent account of how a natural phenomenon of a rain-storm metamorphoses into storm deities.

According to the Rig Veda they wore golden helmets and breastplates, and used their axes to split the clouds so that rain may fall. They were capable causing the mountains to tremble. Though they were the offspring of Rudra, they were previously considered by Indra, The main chieftain of heaven, who was entitled as &quot;Marutvant&quot; (&quot;Accompanied by the Maruts&quot;). They are also accompanied by a female deity, Rodasi, who rides with them through the heavens. She is variously described as their mother and wife of Rudra, standing on the clouds that are the Maruts&#x27; chariot, or their collective wife and beloved, who symbolizes lightning.

The Maruts assist The King of heaven Indra, to defeat Vritra, lending him their power. The myth continues with Indra disputing them their role on the battle, accusing them of having abandoned him after giving him encouragement before the fight, and they quarrel for the sacrifice given by the sage Agastya. However, their place to his side in mythology is accepted, appearing elsewhere with him.

According to later tradition, such as Puranas, the Maruts were born from the broken womb of the goddess Diti, after Indra hurled a thunderbolt at her to prevent her from giving birth to a powerful son. The goddess had intended to remain pregnant for a century before giving birth to a son who would threaten Indra.

<text>Rudras refer to the forms of the god Rudra, whose traditions have since been associated with lord Shiva. They make up eleven of the thirty-three gods in the Vedic pantheon. They are at times identified with the storm deities referred to as Maruts, while at other times considered distinct from them.

While the &quot;Vamana Purana&quot; describes Rudras as the sons of Kashyapa and Aditi, Maruts are described distinct from the Rudras as the 49 sons of Diti, sister of Aditi, and the attendants of Indra, rather than Rudra.

==Birth and names==
The &quot;Ramayana&quot; tells they are eleven of the 33 children of the sage Kashyapa and his wife Aditi, along with the 12 Adityas, 8 Vasus and 2 Ashvins, constituting the Thirty-three gods. The &quot;Vamana Purana&quot; describes the Rudras as the sons of Kashyapa and Aditi. The &quot;Matsya Purana&quot; notes that Surabhi – the mother of all cows and the &quot;cow of plenty&quot; – was the consort of Brahma and their union produced the eleven Rudras. Here they are named 

#Nirṛti
#Śambhu
#Aparājita
#Mṛgavyādha
#Kapardin
#Dahana
#Khara
#Manas
#Ahirbudhnya
#Kapālin
#Piṅgala
#Senāni

The &quot;Harivamsa&quot;, an appendix of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, makes Kashyapa and Surabhi – here, portrayed as his wife – the parents of the Rudras. In another instance in the Mahabharata, it is Dharma (possibly identified with Yama) who is the father of the Rudras and the Maruts.

The &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; narrates that Rudra – here identified as Shiva . The furious Rudra was in Ardhanari form, half his body was male and other half female. He divided himself into two: the male and female. The male form then split itself into eleven, forming the eleven Rudras. Some of them were white and gentle; while others were dark and fierce. They are called:

#Manyu
#Manu 
#Mahmasa 
#Mahan 
#Siva 
#Ṛtudhvaja
#Ugraretas
#Bhava 
#Kāma
#Vāmadeva
#Dhrtavrata

From the woman were born the eleven Rudranis who became wives of the Rudras. They are:
#Dhi 
#Vrtti 
#Usana 
#Urna 
#Niyuta 
#Sarpis 
#Ila 
#Ambika 
#Iravatl 
#Svadha
#Diksa

Brahma allotted to the Rudras the eleven positions of the heart and the five sensory organs, the five organs of action and the mind. Other Puranas call them Aja, Ekapada (Ekapat), Ahirbudhnya, Tvasta, Rudra, Hara, Sambhu, Tryambaka, Aparajita, Isana and Tribhuvana.

In one instance in the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the Rudras are eleven in number and are named:

#Mrgavadha 
#Sarpa 
#Nirriti 
#Ajaikapad 
#Ahi 
#Budhnya 
#Pinakin 
#Dahana 
#Ishvara 
#Kapali 
#Sthanu 
#Bhaga

While Kapālin is described the foremost of Rudras here, in the Bhagavad Gita it is Śankara who is considered the greatest of the Rudras. Both Kapalin and Śankara are epithets of Shiva. In another instance, they are described as sons of Tvastr and named:

#Vishvarupa 
#Ajaikapad 
#Ahi Budhnya 
#Virupaksa 
#Raivata 
#Hara 
#Bahurupa 
#Tryambaka 
#Savitra 
#Jayanta
#Pinakin

While usually the Rudras are described to eleven, in one instance in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;; they are said to be eleven thousand and surrounding Shiva, which is another name for Rudra. The eleven groups of hundred are named:

#Ajaikapad 
#Ahi Budhnya 
#Pinakin 
#Rta 
#Pitrrupa 
#Tryamabaka 
#Maheshvara 
#Vrsakapi 
#Sambhu 
#Havana
#Ishvara

The Bhagavata Purana Canto 3 Chapter 3 mentions that Rudra is born from the anger of Lord Brahma. The names are mentioned in Canto 3 Chapter 3 and Verse 12 as follows:
# Manyu
# Manu
# Mahinasa
# Mahān
# Śiva
# Ṛtadhvaja
# Ugraretā
# Bhava
# Kāla
# Vāmadeva
# Dhṛtavrata
In Bhagavata Purana Canto 6 Chapter 6 the eleven Rudras are said to be the children of Sarūpā and Bhūta. Sarūpā was a daughter of Daksa. The names of the eleven Rudras given in Canto 6 Chapter 6 Verse 17-18 are:
# Raivata
# Aja
# Bhava
# Bhīma
# Vāma
# Ugra
# Vṛṣākapi
# Ajaikapāt
# Ahirbradhna
# Bahurūpa
# Mahān
The &quot;Matsya Purana&quot; mentions the ferocious eleven Rudras – named:

#Kapali 
#Pingala 
#Bhima 
#Virupaksa 
#Vilohita 
#Ajapada
#Ahirabradhya 
#Shasta 
#Shambhu 
#Chanda 
#Bhava

Aiding God Vishnu in his fight against the demons. They wear lion-skins, matted-hair and serpents around their necks. They have yellow throats, hold tridents and skulls and have the crescent moon on their foreheads. Together headed by Kapali, they slay the elephant demon Gajasura.

==Associations==
In Vedic scriptures, Rudras are described as loyal companions of Rudra, who later was identified with Shiva. They are considered as divine aids , messengers and forms of Rudra. They are fearful in nature. The &quot;Satapatha Brahmana&quot; mentions that Rudra is the prince, while Rudras are his subjects. They are considered as attendants of Shiva in later mythology.

The Rig Veda and the Krishna Yajur Veda makes the Rudras the gods of the middle world, situated between earth and heaven i.e. the atmosphere. As wind-gods, the Rudras represent the life-breath. In the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot;, the eleven Rudras are represented by ten vital energies (&quot;rudra-prana&quot;) in the body and the eleventh one being the Ātman (the soul).

The Rudras are said to preside over the second stage of creation and the intermediary stage of life. They govern the second ritual of sacrifice, the mid-day offering and the second stage of life – from the 24th to the 68 year of life. The &quot;Chandogya Upanishad&quot; prescribes that the Rudras be propitiated in case of sickness in this period and further says that they on departing the body become the cause of tears, the meaning of the name Rudra being the &quot;ones who make cry&quot;. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad explicitly states the fact that since the Rudras leaving the body – causing death – makes people cry, they are Rudras.

The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; describes the Rudras as companions of Indra, servants of Shiva and his son Skanda and companions of Yama, who is surrounded by them. They have immense power, wear golden necklaces and are &quot;like lighting-illuminated clouds&quot;. The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; prescribes the worship of the Rudras to gain virile power.

===Association with Maruts===

Rudras are at times identified with the Maruts – sons of Rudra in the Vedas; while at other times, considered distinct from them.

Some scholars believe that Rudras and Maruts could be distinct groups, Rudras being the true followers of Rudra and daivic (Godly) in nature. But poets of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; declared the Maruts to take the position of the Rudras in order to give status to the Vedic god Rudra. Later in post-Vedic literature like the epics and Puranas, Maruts were associated with Indra, while Rudras gained their former status as followers of Rudra, who had evolved into Shiva. However, other scholars disregard this theory and consider that originally Rudras and Maruts were identical. A theory suggests that slowly in the Vedas two classes of Maruts came into existence: the friendly and beneficent, and the roaring and turbulent; the latter grew into the distinct group of deities called the Rudras, who were associated only with the wild Rudra.

In the &quot;Marut Suktas&quot; (RV 1, 2, 5, 8) and &quot;Indra-Suktas&quot; (RV 1, 3, 8, 10) of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; (RV), the epithet &quot;Rudras&quot; – originating from the verb root &quot;rud&quot; or &quot;ru&quot; and meaning howlers, roarers or shouters – is used numerous times for the Maruts – identifying them with the Rudras even when associated with Indra, rather than Rudra. There are some hymns in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; (RV 2, 7, 8, 10) that explicitly distinguish between the Maruts and the Rudras.

While the &quot;Vamana Purana&quot; describes Rudras as the sons of Kashyapa and Aditi, Maruts are described distinct from the Rudras as 49 sons of Diti, sister of Aditi and attendants of Indra.

==Ashwatthama==

Ashwatthama, the son of Drona, is the avatar of one of the eleven Rudras, along with being one of the eight Chiranjivi (the immortals). Drona performed many years of severe penances to please Lord Shiva in order to obtain a son who possessed the same valiance as the latter. Ashwatthama, the powerful son of Drona, though known as the part incarnate of Rudra, was really born of the four parts of Yama (death), Rudra (destruction), Kama (love) and Krodha (anger). Just before Mahabharata war, Bhishma himself declared that it would be virtually impossible for anyone to kill or defeat Ashwatthama in battle as he was the part incarnate of Rudra. Bhishma stated that when Ashwatthama becomes angry, it would become impossible to fight him as he would become &quot;a second Shiva&quot;. The dishonoured death of Drona, Karna and Duryodhana left Aswathama infuriated, and this event led directly and in an unwary-like manner, to the annihilation of most of the Pandava lineage by the hands of Ashwatthama himself. As a result Krșna curses him as being unable to heal. It is said that one can hear him wailing at nights in the Kurukshetra region.

<text>Rudra (/ɾud̪ɾə/; ) is a Rigvedic deity associated with Shiva, the wind or storms, Vayu, medicine, and the hunt. One translation of the name is &#x27;the roarer&#x27;. In the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, Rudra is praised as the &quot;mightiest of the mighty&quot;. Rudra means &quot;who eradicates problems from their roots&quot;. Depending upon the period, the name Rudra can be interpreted as &#x27;the most severe roarer/howler&#x27; or &#x27;the most frightening one&#x27;. This name appears in the Shiva Sahasranama, and R. K. Sharma notes that it is often used as a name of Shiva in later languages. The &quot;Shri Rudram&quot; hymn from the &quot;Yajurveda&quot; is dedicated to Rudra and is important in the Shaivite sect. In the Prathama Anuvaka of Namakam (Taittiriya Samhita 4.5), Rudra is revered as Sadasiva (meaning &#x27;mighty Shiva&#x27;) and Mahadeva. Sadashiva is the Supreme Being, Paramashiva, in the Siddhanta sect of Shaivism.

==Etymology ==
The etymology of the theonym &quot;Rudra&quot; is uncertain. It is usually derived from the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root &quot;rud-&quot; (related to English &quot;rude&quot;), which means &#x27;to cry, howl&#x27;. The name Rudra may thus be translated as &#x27;the roarer&#x27;. An alternative etymology interprets &quot;Rudra&quot; as the &#x27;red one&#x27;, the &#x27;brilliant one&#x27;, possibly derived from a lost root &quot;rud-&quot;, &#x27;red&#x27; or &#x27;ruddy&#x27;, or alternatively, according to Grassman, &#x27;shining&#x27;.

Stella Kramrisch notes a different etymology connected with the adjectival form &quot;raudra&quot;, which means &#x27;wild&#x27;, i.e., of &quot;rude&quot; (untamed) nature, and translates the name &quot;Rudra&quot; as &#x27;the wild one&#x27; or &#x27;the fierce god&#x27;. R. K. Śarmā follows this alternative etymology and translates the name as &#x27;the terrible&#x27; in his glossary for the Shiva Sahasranama. Mallory and Adams also mention a comparison with the Old Russian deity Rŭglŭ to reconstruct a Proto-Indo-European wild-god named &quot;*Rudlos&quot;, though they remind that the issue of the etymology remains problematic: from PIE &quot;*reud-&quot; (&#x27;rend, tear apart&#x27;; cf. Latin &quot;rullus&quot;, &#x27;rustic&#x27;), or &quot;*reu-&quot; (&#x27;howl&#x27;).

The commentator  suggests six possible derivations for &quot;rudra&quot;. However, another reference states that Sayana suggested ten derivations. The adjective &quot;śiva&quot; (&quot;shiva&quot;) in the sense of &#x27;propitious&#x27; or &#x27;kind&#x27; is first applied to the Rudra in RV 10.92.9.

Rudra is called &#x27;the archer&#x27; (Sanskrit: &quot;&quot;) and the arrow is an essential attribute of Rudra. This name appears in the Shiva Sahasranama, and R. K. Śarmā notes that it is used as a name of Shiva often in later languages. The word is derived from the Sanskrit root &quot;-&quot; which means &#x27;to injure&#x27; or &#x27;to kill&#x27;, and Śarmā uses that general sense in his interpretive translation of the name as &#x27;One who can kill the forces of darkness&#x27;. The names (&#x27;bowman&#x27;) and (&#x27;archer&#x27;, literally &#x27;Armed with a hand-full of arrows&#x27;) also refer to archery.

In other contexts the word &quot;rudra&quot; can simply mean &#x27;the number eleven&#x27;. The word &quot;rudraksha&quot; (Sanskrit: &#x27; = &quot;rudra&quot; and &#x27; &#x27;eye&#x27; or tear), or &#x27;eye or tears of Rudra&#x27;, is used as a name for both the berry of the rudraksha tree and a name for a string of the prayer beads made from those seeds.

Rudra is one of the names of Vishnu in Vishnu Sahasranama. Adi Shankara in his commentary to Vishnu Sahasranama defined the name Rudra as &#x27;One who makes all beings cry at the time of cosmic dissolution&#x27;. Author D. A. Desai in his glossary for the Vishnu Sahasranama says Vishnu in the form of Rudra is the one who does the total destruction at the time of great dissolution. This is only the context known where Vishnu is revered as Rudra.

==Rigvedic hymns==
The earliest known mentions of the Vedic deity Rudra, occur in the Rigveda, where three entire hymns are devoted to him (RV 1.114, 2.33, and 7.46). Two further hymns are devoted to Rudra jointly with Soma (RV 1.43 and 6.74). There are about seventy-five references to Rudra in the Rigveda overall.

===Form of Rudra===
In the Rigveda (RV) are verses which speak about the form of Rudra. Some of them are:

===Epithets of fierceness and fright===
In the Rigveda, Rudra&#x27;s role as a frightening god is apparent in references to him as &quot;ghora&quot; (&#x27;extremely terrifying&#x27;), or simply as &quot;asau devam&quot; (&#x27;that god&#x27;). He is &#x27;fierce like a terrific wild beast&#x27; (RV 2.33.11). Chakravarti sums up the perception of Rudra by saying: &#x27;Rudra is thus regarded with a kind of cringing fear, as a deity whose wrath is to be deprecated and whose favor curried&#x27;.

RV 1.114 is an appeal to Rudra for mercy, where he is referred to as &#x27;mighty Rudra, the god with braided hair&#x27;.

In RV 7.46, Rudra is described as armed with a bow and fast-flying arrows, although many other weapons are known to exist. As quoted by R. G. Bhandarkar, the hymn declare that Rudra discharges &#x27;brilliant shafts which run about the heaven and the earth&#x27; (RV 7.46.3), which may be a reference to lightning.

Rudra was believed to cure diseases, and when people recovered from them or were free of them, that too was attributed to the agency of Rudra. He is asked not to afflict children with disease (RV 7.46.2) and to keep villages free of illness (RV 1.114.1). He is said to have healing remedies (RV 1.43.4), as the best physician of physicians (RV 2.33.4), and as possessed of a thousand medicines (RV 7.46.3). So he is described with an alternative name, Vaidyanatha (Lord of Remedies).

===Epithets of supreme rule===

A verse from the Rig Veda (RV 2.33.9) calls Rudra &#x27;The Lord or Sovereign of the Universe&#x27; (&quot;īśānādasya bhuvanasya&quot;):
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em; float:left;&quot;&gt;
&quot;sthirebhiraṅghaiḥ pururūpa ughro babhruḥ śukrebhiḥ pipiśehiraṇyaiḥ&quot;
&quot;īśānādasya bhuvanasya bhūrerna vā u yoṣad rudrādasuryam&quot; (RV 2.33.9)
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em; float:left;&quot;&gt;
With firm limbs, multiform, the strong, the tawny adorns himself with bright gold decorations:
The strength of Godhead never departs from Rudra, him who is Sovereign of this world, the mighty.
&lt;/poem&gt;

A verse of Śrī Rudram (= Yajurveda 16.18) speaks of Rudra as Lord of the Universe: 
Another verse (Yajurveda 16.46) locates Rudra in the heart of the gods, showing that he is the inner Self of all, even the gods: 
In a verse popularly known as the Mahamrityunjaya Mantra, both Rig Veda (7.59.12) and Yajur Veda (3.60) recommend worshipping Rudra to attain moksha (liberation):

In the Taittiriya Aranyaka of Yajur Veda (10.24.1), Rudra is identified as the universal existent (&#x27;all this&#x27;) and thus as the Purusha (Supreme Person or inner Self) of the Vedas:

The Taittiriya Aranyaka of Yajur Veda 1.10.1 identifies Rudra and Brihaspati as Sons and companions of Bhumi (Earth) and Heaven:

===Relation to other deities===
Rudra is used both as a name of Shiva and collectively (&#x27;the Rudras&#x27;) as the name for the Maruts. Maruts are &#x27;storm gods&#x27; associated with the atmosphere. They are a group of gods whose number varies from two to sixty, sometimes also rendered as eleven, thirty-three or a hundred and eighty in number (i. e., three times sixty. See RV 8.96.8.).

The Rudras are sometimes referred to as &#x27;the sons of Rudra&#x27; while Rudra is referred to as &#x27;Father of the Maruts&#x27; (RV 2.33.1).

Rudra is mentioned along with a litany of other deities in RV 7.40.5. Here is the reference to Rudra, whose name appears as one of many gods who are called upon:

One scholiast&#x27;s interpretation of the Sanskrit word &#x27;, meaning &#x27;ramifications&#x27; or &#x27;branches&#x27;, is that all other deities are, as it were, branches of Vishnu, but, Ralph T. H. Griffith cites Ludwig as saying, &#x27;This [...] gives no satisfactory interpretation&#x27; and cites other views which suggest that the text is corrupt at that point.

==Non-Rigvedic hymns==

In the various recensions of the Yajurveda is included a litany of stanzas praising Rudra: &quot;Maitrāyaṇī-Saṃhitā&quot; 2.9.2, &quot;Kāṭhaka-Saṃhitā&quot; 17.11, &quot;Taittirīya-Saṃhitā&quot; 4.5.1 and &quot;Vājasaneyi-Saṃhitā&quot; 16.1–14. This litany is subsequently referred to variously as the &quot;Śatarudriyam&quot; and the &quot;Namakam&quot; (because many of the verses commence with the word &quot;namaḥ&quot;, meaning &#x27;homage&#x27;), or simply the &quot;Rudram&quot;. This litany was recited during the &quot;Agnicayana&quot; ritual (&#x27;the piling of Agni&#x27;), and it later became a standard element in Rudra liturgy.

A selection of similar stanzas is included in the &quot;Paippalāda-Saṃhitā&quot; of the Atharvaveda (PS 14.3–4). This selection, with further PS additions at the end, circulated more widely as the &quot;Nīlarudra&quot; (or &quot;Nīlarudra Upaniṣad&quot;). Lubin suggests that in the &quot;Nīlarudra&quot;, lightning is envisioned both as Rudra&#x27;s arrows and as the deity himself:

The Hindu god Shiva shares several features with Rudra. The theonym &quot;Śiva&quot; (&#x27;kind&#x27;) originated as a euphemistic epithet for Rudra, who is similarly invoked as Aghora (&#x27;not frightful&#x27;) and Abhayaṅkara (&#x27;providing safety&#x27;). Although &quot;Rudra&quot; remains the primary designation of the god, e.g., in the Pāśupata ascetic tradition, lay devotees preferred to address him as &quot;Śiva,&quot; &quot;Maheśvara&quot; (&#x27;Great Lord&#x27;), or &quot;Mahādeva&quot; (&#x27;Great God&#x27;), as in the Śivadharma literature, the Sanskrit epics, and the Purāṇas. Those epithets come to be the primary names of the deity.

===Shri Rudram===

The president of the Ramakrishna Mission, at Chennai, in commentating on the foreword to Swami Amritananda&#x27;s translation of &quot;Sri Rudram and Purushasuktam&quot;, states, &#x27;Rudra to whom these prayers are addressed is not a sectarian deity, but the Supreme Being who is omnipresent and manifests Himself in myriad forms for the sake of the diverse spiritual aspirants&#x27;. Shri Rudram occurs in the fourth Kanda of the Taittiriya Samhita in the Yajurveda.
It is a preeminent Vedic hymn to Shiva as the God of dissolution and it is chanted daily in Shiva temples throughout India.

The prayer depicts the diverse aspects of the Almighty. The Shri Rudram hymn is unique in that it shows the presence of divinity throughout the entire universe. We cannot confine the qualities of the divine to those that are favourable to us. The Lord is both garden and graveyard, the slayer and the most benevolent one. The Almighty is impartial and ubiquitous.

In the hymn, Rudra is described as the most dreaded terroriser (frightening). Shri Rudram describes Rudra the Vedic deity as the personification of &#x27;terror&#x27;. The name Rudra comes from &quot;ru&quot;, meaning &#x27;Roar or howl&#x27; (the words &quot;dreaded&quot; or &quot;fearsome&quot; could only be used as adjectives to Rudra and not as Rudra because Rudra is the personification of terror) and &quot;dra&quot;, which is a superlative meaning &#x27;the most&#x27;. So Rudra, depending on the poetic situation, can mean &#x27;the most severe roarer/howler&#x27; or a hurricane or tempest or &#x27;the most frightening one&#x27;.

==Rudra and Shiva==
Shiva as known today shares many features with Rudra, and Shiva and Rudra are viewed as the same personality in Hindu scriptures. The two names are used synonymously. Rudra, the god of the roaring storm, is usually portrayed in accordance with the element he represents as a fierce, destructive deity.

The oldest surviving text of Hinduism is the Rig Veda, which is dated to between 1700 and 1100 BC based on linguistic and philological evidence. A god named Rudra is mentioned in the Rig Veda. The name Rudra is still used as a name for Shiva. In RV 2.33, he is described as the &#x27;Father of the Rudras&#x27;, a group of storm gods.

Hymn 10.92 of the Rigveda states that the deity Rudra has two natures, one wild and cruel (&quot;rudra&quot;), and another that is kind and tranquil (&quot;shiva&quot;). The Vedic texts mention a horse as the vehicle (&quot;vahana&quot;) of Rudra, the &quot;Hero on horseback&quot; that &quot;should be indulgent&quot; to the singer (RV. 2.33.1). Whereas post-Vedic texts such as the Mahabharata and the Puranas mention Nandi the bull and the zebu as the vehicles of Rudra and of Shiva, thereby unmistakably linking them as the same.

==In Buddhism==
In Tibetan Buddhism, according to the &quot;Padma Thang Yig&quot;, Rudra are devas (beings who live in heaven) at Maheśvara heaven. Or formerly a human monk of noble origin named Koukuntri and then Tharpa Nakpo, who misunderstands dharma and engages in a life of vice and is condemned to Naraka. After 20.000 impure lives, he is eventually reborn as a demon in Sri Lanka by a prostitute who sleeps with three kinds of supernatural creatures, giving him three heads. His birth brings about plague and famine, so he is banished to a charnel ground, but he survives by devouring his mother&#x27;s corpse and returns in order to conquer the world. Becoming the lover of the rakshasa queen Krodhishvari, he battles the gods, who are terrified of his extraordinary power and call the Buddhas and boddhisattvas for help.

The Buddha Vajrasattva, who in a previous life was Tharpa Nakpo&#x27;s master Thupka Zhonu, receives the mission to destroy Rudra, for which he is accompanied by Vajrapani, himself a reborn Pramadeva or Denphak, Nakpo&#x27;s servant and fellow disciple. They both assume the wrathful forms Hayagriva and Vajravarahi, who challenge Rudra with nine dances and battle him. Hayagriva turns diminutive and enters Rudra&#x27;s anus, after which he becomes gigantic and destroys his body from inside out, submitting the demon and converting him to true dharma.

In another version, Hayagriva impersonates Rudra and impregnates Krodishvari. As a result, he is reborn as the resultant child, Vajrarakshasa. He takes over Rudra&#x27;s realm and defeats him by plunging a three-pointed &quot;khaṭvāṅga&quot; into his chest. He then devours Rudra, purifies him in his stomach and excretes him as a protector of dharma, who hands over his army of demons to Vajrarakshasha as attendants. Other versions replace Hayagriva with Ucchusma, an emanation that Vajrapani draws from his own anus.

==In Sikhism==
The 10th Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, describes the incarnation of Rudra in a composition titled &#x27;Rudra Avtar&#x27; in his book the Dasam Granth.

<text>Diti () is a daughter of the &quot;Prajapati&quot; Daksha in Hinduism. She is a wife of the sage Kashyapa and the mother of the demonic race Daityas and the divine group of Marutas.

== Legend ==
According to the &quot;Puranic&quot; scriptures,
Diti is one of the sixty daughters of &quot;Prajapati&quot; Daksha and his wife Asikni. She and her twelve sisters were married to the sage Kashyapa. Diti is described as the mother of two groups of beings—the Daityas and the Maruts. The most prominent of her sons were Hiranyakashipu, Hiranyaksha, Vajranaka, Arunasura, Raktabija and Surapadman. Diti also had a daughter named Simhika (also known as Holika).

=== Birth of Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakashipu ===
The Bhagavata Purana describes the circumstances of the birth of the two powerful daityas:
=== Birth of the maruts ===
After the death of her sons in the Samudra Manthana, Diti grew inconsolable. She begged her husband to grant her a child who would be capable of defeating Indra. In due course, Diti became pregnant and following her husband’s advice, she engaged in tapas and remained chaste. When Indra discovered that the child in Diti&#x27;s womb was to be his slayer, he took on the disguise of an attendant. Indra used his thunderbolt known as the vajra to splinter the fetus into many pieces, from which originated the marutas.

=== Personality ===
Diti is usually depicted as being cruel to both her husband Kashyapa, and her sister Aditi. She is obsessed with trying to bring the asuras into power. She is a bitter enemy of Aditi&#x27;s sons, the devas, and she is instrumental in the asuras gaining control and autonomy over them.

<text>Airavata () is a divine elephant, characterized by four tusks, seven trunks and a white complexion. He is the &quot;king of elephants&quot; also serves as the main vehicle for the deity Indra. It is also called &#x27;abhra-Matanga&#x27;, meaning &quot;elephant of the clouds&quot;; &#x27;Naga-malla&#x27;, meaning &quot;the fighting elephant&quot;; and &#x27;Arkasodara&#x27;, meaning &quot;brother of the sun&quot;. &#x27;Abhramu&#x27; is the elephant wife of Airavata. Airavata is also the third son of Iravati. In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; he is listed as a great serpent.

==Hindu tradition==
The appearance or birth of Airavata varies according to different Hindu texts. In the Ramayana, Airavata was born to Iravati (descendant of the sage, Kashyapa) whereas, the Vishnu Purana notes that Airavata was born from the churning of the ocean of milk. According to the Matangalila, Airavata was born when Brahma sang sacred hymns over the halves of the egg shell from which Garuda hatched, followed by seven more male and eight female elephants. Prithu made Airavata king of all elephants. One of his names means &quot;the one who knits or binds the clouds&quot; since myth has it that these elephants are capable of producing clouds. The connection of elephants with water and rain is emphasized in the mythology of Indra, who rides the elephant Airavata when he defeats Vritra.

It is believed that the elephant guards one of the points of compass. Airavata also stands at the entrance to Svarga, Indra&#x27;s palace. In addition, the eight guardian deities who preside over the points of the compass each sit on an elephant (world elephant). Each of these deities has an elephant that takes part in the defense and protection of its respective quarter. Chief among them is Airavata of Indra. There is a reference to Airavata in the Bhagavad Gita:

Airavata is also known for being the cause of the churning of the ocean of milk. Once sage Durvasa presented a garland to Indra, who passed it on to Airavata. The elephant then threw the garland on to the ground, which angered Durvasa and resulted in the demigods to be &quot;subject to old age and death.&quot; Reversing the curse required the devas to retrieve the nectar of immortality by churning the ocean of milk. 

At Darasuram near Tanjore is a temple where it is believed that Airavata worshipped the Lingam; the Lingam is named after him as Airavateshwara. This temple, which abounds in rare sculpture and architectural workmanship, was built by Rajaraja Chola II (1146–73 CE).

==Jain tradition==
In Jain tradition, when a Tirthankara is born, Indra descends with his consort, Shachi, riding their mount, the great elephant Airavata, to celebrate the event.

==Erawan==
Erawan (, from Pāḷi &quot;Erāvana&quot;, or Sanskrit &quot;Airāvana&quot;) is one of the Thai names of Airavata. It is depicted as a huge elephant with either three or sometimes thirty-three heads which are often shown with more than two tusks. Some statues show Indra, the king of Tavatimsa Heaven, riding on Erawan.

The elephant became the symbol of Bangkok by association with Indra during its foundation as the capital of the new Rattanakosin Kingdom . It is also sometimes associated with the old Lao Kingdom of Lan Xang and the defunct Kingdom of Laos, where it was more commonly known as the &quot;three-headed elephant&quot; and had been used on the royal flag.

==In popular culture==
Airavata is a recruitable character in the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; video game series.

Airavata is referenced in the song &quot;The Animal Tent&quot; on the album &quot;The Circus&quot; by The Venetia Fair:

Airavata is the name of the Volvo bus service that Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation provides.

<doc id="99748" wikidata="Q148773" url="?curid=99748" title="Apsara">
<text>Apsaras (, , Khmer: អប្សរា Thai:นางอัปสรา) are a member of a class of celestial beings in Hindu and Buddhist culture. They were originally a type of female spirit of the clouds and waters, but, later play the role of a &quot;nymph&quot; or &quot;fairy&quot;. They figure prominently in the sculptures, dance, literature and paintings of many South Asian and Southeast Asian cultures. 

The apsaras are described to be beautiful, youthful and elegant, and are said to be able to change their shape at will; making anyone fall for their beauty. There are two types of apsaras—&quot;laukika&quot; (worldly) and &quot;daivika&quot; (divine). They are great in the art of dancing, and often wives of the gandharvas, the court musicians of Indra. The apsaras reside in the palaces of the gods and entertain them by dancing to the music made by the Gandharvas. The 26 apsaras of Indra&#x27;s court are each said to symbolise a different facet of the performing arts, drawing comparisons to the Muses of ancient Greece. They are also renowned for seducing rishis in order to prevent them from attaining divine powers. Urvashi, Menaka, Rambha, Tilottama and Ghritachi are the most famous among the apsaras.

In Japan, &quot;Apsara&quot; are known as &quot;Tennin&quot; (天人); &quot;Tennyo&quot; (天女) for &quot;female Tennin&quot; and &quot;Tennan&quot; (天男) for &quot;male Tennin&quot;.

==Etymology==

The origin of &#x27;apsara&#x27; is the Sanskrit अप्सरस्, &quot;apsaras&quot; (in the stem form, which is the dictionary form). Note that the stem-form ends in &#x27;s&#x27; as distinct from, e.g. the nominative singular &quot;Rāmas / Rāmaḥ&quot; (the deity Ram in Hindi), whose stem form is &quot;Rāma&quot;. The nominative singular form is अप्सरास् &quot;apsarās&quot;, or अप्सरा: &quot;apsarāḥ&quot; when standing alone, which becomes अप्सरा &quot;apsarā&quot; in Hindi, from which in turn the English &quot;apsara&quot; presumably is derived. The Monier-Williams &quot;et al&quot;. (1899) gives the etymology as अप् + √सृ, &quot;going in the waters or between the waters of the clouds&quot;.

Apsaras are widely known as &quot;Apsara&quot; ( ) in Khmer, and also called &quot;Accharā&quot; in Pāli, or &quot;Bidadari&quot; (Malay, Maranao), &quot;Biraddali&quot; (Tausug, Sinama), &quot;Hapsari / Apsari&quot; or &quot;Widadari / Widyadari&quot; (Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese), &quot;Helloi&quot; (Meitei) and &quot;Apsorn&quot; ().

==Literature==

The most ancient descriptions of apsara portray them as &quot;water nymph&quot;-like beings.

The Rigveda tells of an apsara who is the wife of Gandharva; however, the Rigveda also seems to allow for the existence of more than one apsara.
The only apsara specifically named is Urvashi. An entire hymn deals with the colloquy between Urvashi and her mortal lover Pururavas. Later Hindu scriptures allow for the existence of numerous apsaras, who act as the handmaidens of Indra or as dancers at his celestial court serving as musicians alongside the gandharvas (&quot;celestial musicians&quot;).

The Kaushitaki Upanishad mentions apsaras as a class of divinities associated with ointments, garlands, vestments, and powdered aromatics.

The origin of the apsaras is described in the Ramayana and Puranas. Apsaras are further associated with water by relating them to the churning of the ocean, water sports, and groups such as &quot;nāgas&quot;.

In many of the stories related in the Mahabharata, apsaras appear in important supporting roles. The epic contains several lists of the principal Apsaras, which lists are not always identical. Here is one such list, together with a description of how the celestial dancers appeared to the residents and guests at the court of the gods:

 Ghritachi, Menaka, Rambha, Tilottama, Purvachitti, Swayamprabha, Urvashi, Misrakeshi, Dandagauri, Varuthini, Gopali, Sahajanya, Kumbhayoni, Prajagara, Chitrasena, Chitralekha, Saha, and Madhuraswana—these and thousands more, possessed of eyes like lotus leaves, were employed in enticing the hearts of individuals practicing rigid austerities, and they danced there. And possessing slim waists and fair large hips, they began to perform various evolutions, shaking their deep bosoms, and casting their glances around, and exhibiting other attractive attitudes capable of stealing the hearts and resolutions and minds of the spectators.

The Mahabharata documents the exploits of individual apsaras, such as Tilottama, who rescued the world from the rampaging asura brothers Sunda and Upasunda; and Urvashi, who attempted to seduce the hero Arjuna.

A recurring theme in the Mahabharata is that of an apsara sent to distract a sage from his ascetic practices. One story embodying this theme is that recounted by the epic heroine Shakuntala to explain her own parentage. Once upon a time, the sage Vishvamitra generated such intense energy by means of his asceticism that Indra himself became fearful. Deciding that the sage would have to be distracted from his penances, he sent the apsara Menaka to work her charms. Menaka trembled at the thought of angering such a powerful ascetic, but she obeyed the god&#x27;s order. As she approached Vishvamitra, the wind god Vayu tore away her garments. Seeing her thus disrobed, the sage abandoned himself to lust and they made love, during which Vishvamitra&#x27;s asceticism was put on hold. As a consequence, Menaka gave birth to a daughter, whom she abandoned on the banks of a river. That daughter was Shakuntala herself, the narrator of the story.

Shu Ting referenced apsara in her poem &quot;O Motherland, Dear Motherland&quot;.

==In arts==
Many Indian apsaras were identified with names and were central in myths. However, since they were not attributed specific physical features or attributes, artistic depictions do not individualize them.

===Natya Shastra===
&quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, the principal work of dramatic theory for Sanskrit drama, lists the following apsaras: Manjukesi, Sukesi, Misrakesi, Sulochana, Saudamini, Devadatta, Devasena, Manorama, Sudati, Sundari, Vigagdha, Vividha, Budha, Sumala, Santati, Sunanda, Sumukhi, Magadhi, Arjuni, Sarala, Kerala, Dhrti, Nanda, Supuskala, Supuspamala and Kalabha.

===Cambodia===
Apsaras represent an important motif in the stone bas-reliefs of the Angkorian temples in Cambodia (8th–13th centuries AD), however, not all female images are considered to be apsaras. In harmony with the Indian association of dance with apsaras, Khmer female figures that are dancing or are poised to dance are considered &quot;apsaras&quot;; female figures, depicted individually or in groups, who are standing still and facing forward in the manner of temple guardians or custodians are called &quot;devatas&quot;.

Angkor Wat, the largest Angkor temple (built in 1113–1150 AD), features both &quot;Apsaras&quot; and &quot;Devata&quot;, however, the devata type are the most numerous with more than 1,796 in the present research inventory. Angkor Wat architects employed small apsara images (30–40 cm as seen below) as decorative motifs on pillars and walls. They incorporated larger devata images (all full-body portraits measuring approximately 95–110  cm) more prominently at every level of the temple from the entry pavilion to the tops of the high towers. In 1927, Sappho Marchal published a study cataloging the remarkable diversity of their hair, headdresses, garments, stance, jewelry and decorative flowers, which Marchal concluded were based on actual practices of the Angkor period. Some devatas appear with arms around each other and seem to be greeting the viewer. &quot;The devatas seem to epitomize all the elements of a refined elegance,&quot; wrote Marchal.

The bas-reliefs of Angkorian temples have become an inspiration of Khmer classical dance. The indigenous ballet-like performance art of Cambodia is frequently called &quot;Apsara Dance&quot;. The dance was created by the Royal Ballet of Cambodia in the mid-20th century under the patronage of Queen Sisowath Kossamak of Cambodia. The role of the apsara is played by a woman, wearing a tight-fitting traditional dress with gilded jewelry and headdress modelled after Angkor bas-reliefs, whose graceful, sinuous gestures are codified to narrate classical myths or religious stories.

===Java and Bali, Indonesia===

In the Indonesian language throughout medieval times, apsaras are also known as &#x27;bidadari&#x27;, being conflated with the &#x27;vidyadharis&#x27; (from Sanskrit word &quot;vidhyadhari&quot;: &quot;vidhya&quot;, &#x27;knowledge&#x27;; &quot;dharya&quot;, &#x27;having, bearer, or bringer&#x27;) known as &quot;Bidadari&quot; in the modern Indonesian, the females of the vidyādharas, another class of celestial beings in Indian mythology. &#x27;Vidyādhara&#x27; literally means &#x27;possessed of science or spells&#x27;, and refers to &#x27;a kind of supernatural being ... possessed of magical power&#x27; or &#x27;fairy&#x27; according to Monier-Williams&#x27; dictionary. The bidadaris are heavenly maidens, living in the svargaloka or in celestial palace of Indra, described in Balinese dedari (bidadari or apsara) dance.

Traditionally apsaras are described as celestial maidens living in Indra&#x27;s heaven (Kaéndran). They are well known for their special task: being sent to earth by Indra to seduce ascetics who by their severe practices may become more powerful than the gods. This theme occurs frequently in Javanese traditions, including the &quot;Kakawin Arjunawiwaha&quot;, written by mpu Kanwa in 1030 during the reign of king Airlangga. The story tells that Arjuna, in order to defeat the giant Niwatakawaca, engaged in meditation and asceticism, whereupon Indra sent apsaras to seduce him. Arjuna, however, managed to conquer his lust and then to win the ultimate weapons from the gods to defeat the giant.

Later in the Javanese tradition the apsara was also called &quot;Hapsari&quot;, also known as &quot;Widodari&quot; (from Sanskrit word vidyādhari). The Javanese Hindu-Buddhist tradition also influenced Bali. In Balinese dance, the theme of celestial maidens often occurs. Dances such as &quot;Sanghyang Dedari&quot; and &quot;Legong&quot; depicted divine maidens in their own way. In the court of Mataram Sultanate the tradition of depicting heavenly maidens in dances is still alive and well. The Javanese court dances of Bedhaya portray apsaras.

However, after the adoption of Islam, bidadari is equated with houri, the heavenly maiden mentioned in the Quran, in which God stated that the &#x27;forbidden pearls&#x27; of heaven are for those men who have resisted temptation and borne life&#x27;s trials. Islam spread in the Malay archipelago when Arabic traders came to trade spices with the Malays; at that time, Hinduism formed the basis of the Malay culture, but syncretism with the Islamic religion and culture spawned the idea of a &quot;Bidadari&quot;. It is usually seen as a prize offered to those who lived a lifestyle in service to and pleasing to God; after death, the Bidadari was the man&#x27;s wife or wives, depending on what type of person he was. The worthiness of a man who was offered Bidadari depended upon his holiness: how often he prayed, how much he turned away from the &#x27;outside world&#x27;, and how little he heeded worldly desires.
Images of apsaras are found in several temples of ancient Java dating from the era of the Sailendra dynasty to that of the Majapahit empire. The apsara celestial maidens might be found as decorative motifs or also as integral parts of a story in bas-relief. Images of apsaras can be found on Borobudur, Mendut, Prambanan, Plaosan, and Penataran.

At Borobudur apsaras are depicted as divinely beautiful celestial maidens, pictured either in standing or in flying positions, usually holding lotus blossoms, spreading flower petals, or waving celestial clothes as if they were wings enabling them to fly. The temple of Mendut near Borobudur depicted groups of &quot;devatas&quot;, divine beings flying in heaven, which included apsaras. In the Prambanan temple compound, especially in Vishnu temple, along with the gallery, some images of male devata are found flanked by two apsaras.

===Manipur, India===
In the ancient Manipur culture of the Meitei people of northeastern India, apsaras are considered as celestial nymphs or &quot;hellois&quot; as the flying creatures resembling the human female body attracting the male wanderers or any knights who lost their ways in the woods. They were known for their beauty, glamour, magical powers and enchanting supernatural Androphilic Magnetism. They are believed to be seven in number and are the daughters of the sky god or the &quot;Soraren&quot; deity.

===Champa===
Apsaras were also an important motif in the art of Champa, medieval Angkor&#x27;s neighbour to the east along the coast of what is now central Vietnam. Especially noteworthy are the depictions of apsaras in the Tra Kieu Style of Cham art, a style which flourished in the 10th and 11th centuries AD.
===China===
Apsaras are often depicted in East Asian Buddhist art. They are referred to as feitian () in Chinese.

They are depicted as flying figures in the mural paintings and sculptures of Buddhist cave sites in China such as in the Mogao Caves, Yulin Caves, Tianlongshan grottoes, the Yungang, and Longmen Grottoes. They are also depicted on tiles of pagoda, such as Xiuding-si pagoda. 

They may also be depicted as dancers or musicians holding musical instruments such as flute, pipa, or sheng. Apsara may be portrayed as multiple spirits who played music for Buddhas. Generally, they are depicted with a long skirt fluttering in the wind.

Apsara is sometimes portrayed as a single powerful and influential spirit or god who wears an outfit with &quot;flowing sleeves&quot; and lives in &quot;Tian&quot;. This version of Apsara is used in Chinese folk religion as an object of worship and in Chinese folklore.

<text>A gandharva () is a member of a class of celestial beings in Indian religions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, whose males are divine performers such as musicians and singers, and the females are divine dancers. In Hinduism, they are regarded to be the celestial demigods who serve as the musicians of the devas.

It is also a term for skilled singers in Indian classical music. In Buddhism, this term also refers to a being in the intermediate state (between death and rebirth).

==In Hinduism==
In Hinduism, the gandharvas () are a class of minor deities who serve as divine musicians in Hindu mythology. The term gandharva is present in Vedic sources (including in the Rigveda) as a singular deity. According to Oberlies, &quot;In mandala I, IX and X the gandharva is presented as a celestial being (dwelling near the Sun / in the heavenly waters) which watches over the Soma (apparently) for the benefit of the gods and the sacrificers.&quot; The gandharva also &quot;receives the Soma from the ‘Daughter of the Sun&#x27; to put it into the Soma plant (RV 9.113.3), i.e., to bring it to this world.&quot; The gandharva also brings other things from the beyond, including humans (RV 10.10.4) and the horse (RV 1.163.2). As such, the function of the gandharva is &quot;to escort things from ‘outside&#x27; into this world thereby divesting them of their (potential) dangerous nature.&quot; Later, the figure also came to be associated with fertility and virility.

The Atharvaveda mentions 6,333 gandharvas. They are generally the husbands of apsaras. They are described as handsome beings who wear fragrant attire and are passionate about women. Some are part animal, usually a bird or horse. They have exceptional musical skills. They guard the sacred Soma drink, and play beautiful music for the devas in their palaces. Gandharvas usually live in Indraloka and serve at Indra&#x27;s court, though they also have their own realm, called the Gandharvaloka. Female gandharvas are called gandharvis.

In Hindu law, a gandharva marriage is one contracted by mutual consent and without formal rituals.

Gandharvas are mentioned extensively in the epic Mahabharata as associated with the devas (as dancers and singers) and with the yakshas, as formidable warriors. They are mentioned as spread across various territories.Some of the most prominent gandharvas include Tumburu, Visvavasu (who was the father of Pramadvara), Chitrangada (who killed Chitrangada, the son of Shantanu and Satyavati), Chitrasena (with whom the Kauravas and Pandavas fought in the &quot;Ghosha-yatra&quot;), Drumila (the biological father of Kamsa in some texts), and Candavega (king of gandharvas who invaded the city of Purañjana).

===Parentage===

Various parentage is given for the gandharvas. They are called the creatures of Prajapati, of Brahma, of Kashyapa and Pradha, of the Munis, of Arishta, or of Vāc.

The Bhagavata Purana mentions that when Brahma, during creation, saw the activities of some sexually active asuras, he laughed. From his laughter were produced the gandharvas.

==In Buddhism==

A gandharva is one of the lowest-ranking Devas in Buddhist cosmology. They are classed among the Cāturmahārājakāyika Devas, and are subject to the Great King , Guardian of the East. Beings are reborn among the gandharvas as a consequence of having practiced the most basic form of ethics (Janavasabha Sutta, DN.18). 
gandharvas can fly through the air, and are known for their skill as musicians. They are connected with trees and flowers, and are described as dwelling in the scents of bark, sap, and blossoms. They are among the beings of the wilderness that might disturb a monk meditating alone.

The terms and  sometimes refer to the same entity. in these cases is the more general term, including a variety of lower deities.

===Intermediate Rebirth===
In the &quot;Mahātaṇhāsankhaya Sutta&quot; of the &quot;Majjhima Nikāya&quot;, the Buddha explains to the bhikkhus that an embryo develops when three conditions are met: the woman must be in the correct point of her menstrual cycle, the woman and man must have sexual intercourse, and a gandhabba must be present. According to the commentary of this sutta, the use of the word &quot;gandhabba&quot; doesn&#x27;t refer to a celestial Deva, but a being enabled to be born by its karma. It is the state of a sentient being between rebirths.

===Notable gandharvas===
Among the notable gandharvas mentioned (in DN.20 and DN.32) are Panāda, Opamañña, Nala, Cittasena, Mātali, and Janesabha. The last in this list is thought to be synonymous with Janavasabha, a rebirth of King Bimbisāra of Magadha. Mātali is the charioteer of Śakra.

Timbarū is a chieftain of the gandharvas. There is a romantic story told about the love between his daughter Bhaddā Suriyavacchasā (Sanskrit: ) and another gandharva, Pañcasikha (Sanskrit: ). Pañcasikha fell in love with Suriyavacchasā when he saw her dancing before Śakra, but she was then in love with Mātali&#x27;s son Sikhandī (or Sikhaddi). Pañcasikha went to Timbarū&#x27;s home and played a melody on his flute of beluva-wood, with which he had great skill, and sang a love song in which he interwove themes about the Buddha and the Arhats.

Śakra petitioned Pañcasikha to intercede with the Buddha so that he might have an audience with him. As a reward for Pañcasikha&#x27;s services, Śakra was able to get Suriyavacchasā, already pleased with Pañcasikha&#x27;s display of skill and devotion, to agree to marry Pañcasikha.

Pañcasikha also acts as a messenger for the Four Heavenly Kings, conveying news from them to Mātali, the latter representing Śakra and the  Devas.

==In Jainism==
 In Jainism, gandharvas are classed among the eight Vyantara Devas.

The Tiloyapaṇṇatti provides a list of ten gandharvas:

*Hāhā
*Huhū
*Nārada
*Tumbara
*Vāsava
*Kadamba
*Mahāsvara
*Gītarati
*Gītarasa
*Vajravān

The Saṃgrahaṇī Sūtra of the Śvetāmbara sect provides a slightly different list:

*Hāhā
*Huhū
*Tumburu
*Nārada
*Ṛṣivādika
*Bhūtavādika
*Kadamba
*Mahākadamba
*Raivata
*Viśvāvasu
*Gītarati
*Gītayaśas

The Digambara sect describes the gandharvas as having a golden complexion while the Śvetāmbara tradition recognizes them as blackish. The Tumbaru is their sacred tree.

<text>Surveyor 2 was to be the second lunar lander in the uncrewed American Surveyor program to explore the Moon. After launch on September 20, 1966, a mid-course correction failure resulted in the spacecraft losing control. Contact was lost with the spacecraft at 9:35 UTC, September 22.

==Background==

On February 3, 1966, the Luna 9 spacecraft was the first spacecraft to achieve a lunar soft landing and to transmit photographic data to Earth. On May 30, Surveyor 1 launched, landing on Oceanus Procellarum on June 2. This craft also transmitted photographic data back to Earth.

This spacecraft was the second of a series designed to achieve a soft landing on the Moon and to return lunar surface photography for determining characteristics of the lunar terrain for Apollo program lunar landing missions. Besides transmitting photos, Surveyor 2 was planned to perform a &#x27;bounce&#x27;, to photograph underneath its own landing site. It was also equipped to return data on radar reflectivity of the lunar surface, bearing strength of the lunar surface, and spacecraft temperatures for use in the analysis of lunar surface temperatures.

==Launch==

The launch took place from Space Launch Complex 36A at Cape Kennedy, Florida aboard an Atlas-Centaur rocket. Liftoff was at 12:32 UTC on 20 September 1966.

==Failure==
The target area proposed was within Sinus Medii. The Atlas-Centaur had placed Surveyor 2 on a path to the Moon that was only 130 km from its aim point. During the midcourse correction maneuver one vernier thruster failed to ignite, resulting in unbalanced thrust that caused the spacecraft to tumble for its remaining 54 hours. Attempts to salvage the mission failed. Contact was lost with the spacecraft at 9:35 UTC, September 22. The spacecraft was targeted at Sinus Medii, but crashed near Copernicus crater. The spacecraft was calculated to have impacted the lunar surface at 03:18 UTC, September 23, 1966. Its weight on impact was 644 lb (292 kg), and speed was about 6000 miles an hour (2.6 km/s = 5840 mph), slightly over lunar escape velocity (2.4 km/s) and similar to the impact velocities of the Ranger program spacecraft.

==Aftermath==
Lunar exploration continued to be challenging. The next Soviet mission, Cosmos 111, was launched on March 1, 1966, but failed to reach a proper lunar trajectory, re-entering Earth&#x27;s atmosphere two days later. Surveyor 3 soft-landed on April 20, 1967, at the Mare Cognitum portion of the Oceanus Procellarum. It transmitted a total of 6,315 television images to the Earth.

There were seven Surveyor missions; five were successful. Surveyors 2 and 4 failed. Each consisted of a single uncrewed spacecraft designed and built by Hughes Aircraft Company. The precise location of the Surveyor 2 crash site is unknown.

==Centaur upper stage==
The Centaur upper stage of the rocket used to launch Surveyor continued on its original trajectory past the Moon, placing it into a solar orbit similar to that of the Earth. The Centaur was untracked from that point forward. In August 2020, NASA announced the sighting of an object in a solar orbit which could shortly make a close pass with the Earth. On September 23, 2020, NASA announced that this was likely the lost Centaur booster, and likely to be re-captured into Earth orbit. This would be the second time that a rocket upper stage has done so, after the upper stage of a Saturn V rocket from the Apollo 12 launch re-entered Earth orbit in 2002. In December 2020, NASA confirmed that it was the lost Centaur stage.

<text>Surveyor 4 is the fourth lunar lander in the American uncrewed Surveyor program sent to explore the surface of the Moon. This spacecraft crashed after an otherwise flawless mission; telemetry contact was lost 2.5 minutes before touchdown. The planned landing target was Sinus Medii (Central Bay) at 0.4° north latitude and 1.33° west longitude.

Surveyor 6 successfully landed near the crash site of Surveyor 4 a few months later in November 1967.

==Equipment==
This spacecraft was the fourth in a series designed to achieve a soft landing on the Moon and to return photography of the lunar surface for determining characteristics of the lunar terrain for Apollo lunar landing missions. Equipment on board included a television camera and auxiliary mirrors, a soil mechanics surface sampler, strain gauges on the spacecraft landing legs, and numerous engineering sensors. Like Surveyor 3, Surveyor 4 was also equipped with a surface claw (with a magnet in the claw) to detect and measure ferrous elements in the lunar surface.

After a flawless flight to the Moon, radio signals from the spacecraft ceased during the terminal-descent phase at 02:03 UT on July 17, 1967, approximately 2.5 minutes before touchdown. Contact with the spacecraft was never reestablished, and the mission was unsuccessful. The solid-fuel retrorocket may have exploded near the end of its scheduled burn.

<text>Surveyor 5 is the fifth lunar lander of the American uncrewed Surveyor program sent to explore the surface of the Moon. Surveyor 5 landed on Mare Tranquillitatis in 1967. A total of 19,118 images were transmitted to Earth.

== Mission ==
The mission experienced a helium leak in the system that pressurized the liquid-fuel vernier engines that could have resulted in failure. An improvised landing sequence which started the retrorocket just 42 km above the Moon (about half the usual height) allowed the vernier engines to bring the craft down in 106 seconds from a height of only 1340 m (about 10% of the usual). This brought the craft down with a helium pressure on the edge of what would have shut the engines down from lack of pressure.

The landing, however, was successful, and data was received for two weeks after the landing. A miniature chemical analysis lab using an alpha particle backscatter device was used to determine the lunar surface soil consisted of basaltic rock. A similar instrument, the APXS, was used onboard several Mars missions.

Surveyor 5 was the third spacecraft in the Surveyor series to achieve a successful lunar soft landing. The spacecraft had a basic triangular structure of aluminum tubing that provided mounting surfaces for engineering and scientific equipment. The objectives were to obtain postlanding television pictures of the lunar surface, conduct a Vernier engine erosion experiment, determine the relative abundance of the chemical elements in the lunar soil, obtain touchdown dynamics data, and obtain thermal and radar reflectivity data. 

Instrumentation for this spacecraft was similar to that of the previous Surveyors and included landing legs, a Vernier propulsion system, and numerous engineering sensors. An alpha-scattering instrument was installed in place of the surface sampler, and a small bar magnet attached to one footpad was included to detect the presence of magnetic material in the lunar soil. The spacecraft landed at 00:46:44 UT on September 11, 1967 (7:46 p.m. EST September 10) in Mare Tranquillitatis, at 1.41° N latitude and 23.18° E longitude (selenographic coordinates), within the rimless edge of a small crater on a slope of about 20 deg. The spacecraft transmitted excellent data for all experiments from shortly after touchdown until October 18, 1967, with an interval of no transmission from September 24 to October 15, 1967, during the first lunar night. Transmissions were received until November 1, 1967, when shutdown for the second lunar night occurred. Transmissions were resumed on the third and fourth lunar days, with the final transmission occurring on December 17, 1967. Pictures were transmitted during the first, second, and fourth lunar days. Less than two years later the first crewed landing, Apollo 11, would land 25 km south-southwest of Surveyor 5.

The landing, however, was successful, and data was received for two weeks after the landing. A miniature chemical analysis lab using an alpha particle backscatter device was used to determine the lunar surface soil consisted of basaltic rock. A similar instrument, the APXS, was used onboard several Mars missions.

The objectives were to obtain postlanding television pictures of the lunar surface, conduct a Vernier engine erosion experiment, determine the relative abundance of the chemical elements in the lunar soil, obtain touchdown dynamics data, and obtain thermal and radar reflectivity data.

== Launch ==
Surveyor 5 was launched on the Atlas-Centaur rocket on September 8, 1967 from Cape Canaveral.

==Science instruments==

===Television===
The TV camera consisted of a vidicon tube, 25 and 100 mm focal length lenses, shutters, clear, red, green and blue optical filters, and iris mounted along an axis inclined approximately 16° to the central axis of the spacecraft. The camera was mounted under a mirror that could be moved in azimuth and elevation. Camera operation was totally dependent upon receipt of the proper command structure from Earth. Frame by frame coverage of the lunar surface was obtained over 360° in azimuth and from +40° above the plane normal to the camera &quot;z&quot;-axis to 65° below this plane. Both 600-line and 200-line modes of operation were used. The 200-line mode transmitted over an omnidirectional antenna and scanned one frame each 61.8 seconds. A complete video transmission of each 200-line picture required 20 seconds and utilized a bandwidth of 1.2 kHz. Most transmissions consisted of the 600-line pictures, which were telemetered by a directional antenna. These frames were scanned each 3.6 seconds. Each 600-line picture required nominally 1 second to be read from the vidicon and utilized a 220 kHz bandwidth for transmission.

The television images were displayed on a slow scan monitor coated with a long persistency phosphor. The persistency was selected to optimally match the nominal maximum frame rate. One frame of TV identification was received for each incoming TV frame and was displayed in real time at a rate compatible with that of the incoming image. These data were recorded on a video magnetic tape recorder and on 70 mm film. During the first lunar day, which ended on September 24, 1967, 18,006 high quality television pictures were transmitted. After being shut down during the lunar night, more than 20 days, the camera responded to commands and transmitted an additional 1,048 pictures between October 15 and 23, 1967. Another 64 pictures were transmitted on the fourth lunar day, but the quality of pictures taken after the first lunar day was poor due to camera degradation resulting from the lunar night temperatures.
===Alpha-scattering surface analyzer===
The alpha-scattering surface analyzer was designed to measure directly the abundances of the major elements of the lunar surface. The instrumentation consisted of six alpha sources (curium 242) collimated to irradiate a 100 mm diameter opening in the bottom of the instrument where the sample was located and two parallel but independent charged particle detector systems. One system, containing two sensors, detected the energy spectra of the alpha particles scattered from the lunar surface, and the other, containing four sensors, detected energy spectra of the protons produced via reactions (alpha and proton) in the surface material. Each detector assembly was connected to a pulse height analyzer. A digital electronics package, located in a compartment on the spacecraft, continuously telemetered signals to earth whenever the experiment was operating. The spectra contained quantitative information on all major elements in the samples except for hydrogen, helium, and lithium. The experiment provided 83 hours of high quality data during the first lunar day. During the second lunar day, 22 hours of data were accumulated. However, detector noise posed a problem in the reduction of data from this second day.

<text>Surveyor 6 is the sixth lunar lander of the American uncrewed Surveyor program that reached the surface of the Moon. Surveyor 6 landed on the Sinus Medii. A total of 30,027 images were transmitted to Earth.

This spacecraft is the fourth of the Surveyor series to successfully achieve a soft landing on the Moon, obtain post landing television pictures, determine the abundance of the chemical elements in the lunar soil, obtain touchdown dynamics data, obtain thermal and radar reflectivity data, and conduct a Vernier engine erosion experiment. Virtually identical to Surveyor 5, this spacecraft carried a television camera, a small bar magnet attached to one footpad, and an alpha-scattering instrument as well as the necessary engineering equipment. It landed on November 10, 1967, in Sinus Medii, 0.49 deg in latitude and 1.40 deg w longitude (selenographic coordinates)–the center of the Moon&#x27;s visible hemisphere. The spacecraft accomplished all planned objectives. The successful completion of this mission satisfied the Surveyor program&#x27;s obligation to the Apollo project. On November 24, 1967, the spacecraft was shut down for the two-week lunar night. Contact was made on December 14, 1967, but no useful data was obtained.

Lunar soil surveys were completed using photographic and alpha particle backscattering methods. A similar instrument, the APXS, was used onboard several Mars missions.

In a further test of space technology, Surveyor 6&#x27;s engines were restarted and burned for 2.5 seconds in the first lunar liftoff on November 17 at 10:32 UTC. This created 150 lbf (700 N) of thrust and lifted the vehicle 12 feet (4 m) from the lunar surface. After moving west eight feet, (2.5 m) the spacecraft once again successfully soft landed and continued functioning as designed.

Surveyor 6 landed near the crash site of Surveyor 4, which malfunctioned a few months earlier in July 1967.

== Science experiments ==

=== Television ===
The TV camera consisted of a vidicon tube, 25 and 100 mm focal length lenses, shutters, polarizing filters (as opposed to color filters used on the previous Surveyor cameras), and iris mounted nearly vertically and surmounted by a mirror that could be adjusted by stepping motors to move in both azimuth and elevation. The polarizing filters served as analyzers for the detection of measurement of the linearly polarized component of light scattered from the lunar surface. An auxiliary mirror was used for viewing the lunar surface beneath the spacecraft. The frame by frame coverage of the lunar surface provided a 360 deg azimuth view and an elevation view from approximately +90 deg above the plane normal to the camera z axis to −60 deg below this same plane. Both 600 line and 200 line modes of operation were used. The 200 line mode transmitted over an omnidirectional antenna and scanned one frame each 61.8 seconds. A complete video transmission of each 200 line picture required 20 seconds and utilized a bandwidth of 1.2 kHz. Most transmissions consisted of the 600 line pictures, which were telemetered by a directional antenna. 

The frames were scanned each 3.6 seconds. Each frame required nominally one second to be read from the vidicon and utilized a 220 kHz bandwidth for transmission. The optical surfaces were the cleanest of any mission because of a redesigned mirror hood. The television images were displayed on a slow scan monitor coated with a long persistence phosphor. The persistence was selected to optimally match the nominal maximum frame rate. One frame of TV identification was received for each incoming TV frame and was displayed in real time at a rate compatible with that of the incoming image. These data were recorded on a video magnetic tape recorder and on 70 mm film. The camera performance was excellent in terms of both the quantity and quality of pictures. Between lunar landing, lunar &#x27;second&#x27; landing, and the lunar first day sunset on November 24, 1967, 29,914 pictures were taken and transmitted.
=== Alpha-Scattering Surface Analyzer ===
The alpha-scattering surface analyzer was designed to measure directly the abundances of the major elements of the lunar surface. The instrumentation consisted of an alpha source (curium 242) collimated to irradiate a 100 mm (3.94 in) diameter opening in the bottom of the instrument where the sample was located and two parallel but independent charged particle detector systems. One system, containing two sensors, detected the energy spectra of the alpha particles scattered from the lunar surface, and the other, containing four sensors, detected energy spectra of the protons produced via reactions (alpha and protons) in the surface material. Each detector assembly was connected to a pulse height analyzer. 

A digital electronics package, located in a compartment on the spacecraft, continuously telemetered signals to Earth whenever the experiment was operating. The spectra contained quantitative information on all major elements in the samples except for hydrogen, helium, and lithium. Curium collected on the collimator films and was scattered by the gold plating on the inside bottom of the sensor head. This resulted in a gradually increasing background and reduction of the sensitivity technique for heavy elements. One proton detector was turned off during the second day of operation because of noise. A total of 43 hours of data was obtained from November 11 to 24, 1967. The final data was obtained 4 hours after local sunset. However, after the spacecraft &#x27;hopping&#x27; maneuver on November 17, 1967, the sensor head was upside down. Measurements were continued in order to obtain information on solar protons and cosmic rays. Therefore, data for the purpose of the chemical analysis of lunar surface material were obtained only during the first 30 hours of operation. During this period, 27 hours and 44 min of data were known to be noise free.

=== Accomplishments ===
Surveyor 6 was the first spacecraft to lift off from another celestial body. It was monitored by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. It used its liquid-fueled vernier engines to lift itself from its original landing site to a position some 10 feet away.

This was later noted by the Mars Geyser Hopper mission as a post-soft landing propulsive hop that pre-dated its proposal.

<doc id="99761" wikidata="Q64897" url="?curid=99761" title="Soma (drink)">
<text>In the Vedic tradition, soma () is a ritual drink of importance among the early Vedic Indo-Aryans. The Rigveda mentions it, particularly in the Soma Mandala. Gita mentions the drink in chapter 9. It is equivalent to the Iranian haoma.

The texts describe the preparation of soma by means of extracting the juice from a plant, the identity of which is now unknown and debated among scholars. Both in the ancient religions of Historical Vedic religion and Zoroastrianism, the name of the drink and the plant are not exactly the same.

There has been much speculation about the most likely identity of the original plant. Traditional Indian accounts, such as those from practitioners of Ayurveda, Siddha medicine, and Somayajna called Somayajis, identify the plant as &quot;Somalata&quot; (&quot;Cynanchum acidum&quot;).
Non-Indian researchers have proposed candidates including Amanita muscaria, Psilocybin mushrooms, Peganum harmala and Ephedra sinica.

==Etymology==
Soma is a Vedic Sanskrit word that literally means &quot;distill, extract, sprinkle&quot;, often connected in the context of rituals.

Soma&#x27;s Avestan cognate is the &quot;haoma&quot;. According to Geldner (1951), the word is derived from Indo-Iranian roots &quot;*sav-&quot; (Sanskrit &quot;sav-/su&quot;) &quot;to press&quot;, i.e. &quot;*sau-ma-&quot; is the drink prepared by pressing the stalks of a plant, but the word and the related practices were borrowed by the Indo-Aryans from the Bactria–Margiana culture (BMAC). Although the word is only attested in Indo-Iranian traditions, Manfred Mayrhofer has proposed a Proto-Indo-European origin from the root .

==Origins==
The Vedic religion was the religion of some of the Vedic Indo-Aryan tribes, the &quot;&quot;, who migrated into the Indus River valley region of the Indian subcontinent. The Indo-Aryans were speakers of a branch of the Indo-European language family, which originated in the Sintashta culture and further developed into the Andronovo culture, which in turn developed out of the Kurgan culture of the Central Asian steppes. The Vedic beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era were closely related to the hypothesised Proto-Indo-European religion, and show relations with rituals from the Andronovo culture, from which the Indo-Aryan people descended. According to Anthony, the Old Indic religion probably emerged among Indo-European immigrants in the contact zone between the Zeravshan River (present-day Uzbekistan) and (present-day) Iran. It was &quot;a syncretic mixture of old Central Asian and new Indo-European elements&quot; which borrowed &quot;distinctive religious beliefs and practices&quot; from the Bactria–Margiana culture (BMAC). This syncretic influence is supported by at least 383 non-Indo-European words that were borrowed from this culture, including the god Indra and the ritual drink Soma. According to Anthony,
==Vedic soma==

In the Vedas, the same word (soma) is used for the drink, the plant, and its deity. Drinking &quot;soma&quot; produces immortality (&quot;Amrita&quot;, Rigveda 8.48.3). Indra and Agni are portrayed as consuming soma in copious quantities. In the vedic ideology, Indra drank large amounts of soma while fighting the serpent demon Vritra. The consumption of soma by human beings is well attested in Vedic ritual. The Soma Mandala of the Rigveda is completely dedicated to Soma Pavamana, and is focused on a moment in the ritual when the soma is pressed, strained, mixed with water and milk, and poured into containers. These actions are described as a representation of a variety of things, including a king conquering territory, the Sun&#x27;s journey through the cosmos, or a bull running to mate with cows (represented by the milk). The most important myth about Soma is about his theft. In it, Soma was originally held captive in a citadel in heaven by the archer Kṛśānu. A falcon stole Soma, successfully escaping Kṛśānu, and delivered Soma to Manu, the first sacrificer. Additionally, Soma is associated with the moon in the late Rigveda and Middle Vedic period. Sūryā, the daughter of the Sun, is sometimes stated to be the wife of Soma.

The &quot;Rigveda&quot; (8.48.3) says:
Stephanie W. Jamison and Joel P. Brereton translates this as:
In the Vedas, soma &quot;is both a plant and a god.&quot;

==Avestan haoma==

The finishing of &quot;haoma&quot; in Zoroastrianism may be glimpsed from the Avesta (particularly in the &quot;Hōm Yast&quot;, Yasna 9), and Avestan language &quot;*hauma&quot; also survived as Middle Persian &quot;hōm&quot;. The plant &quot;haoma&quot; yielded the essential ingredient for the ritual drink, &quot;parahaoma&quot;.

In Yasna 9.22, haoma grants &quot;speed and strength to warriors, excellent and righteous sons to those giving birth, spiritual power and knowledge to those who apply themselves to the study of the nasks&quot;. As the religion&#x27;s chief cult divinity he came to be perceived as its divine priest. In Yasna 9.26, Ahura Mazda is said to have invested him with the sacred girdle, and in Yasna 10.89, to have installed haoma as the &quot;swiftly sacrificing &quot;zaotar&quot;&quot; (Sanskrit &quot;hotar&quot;) for himself and the Amesha Spenta.

==Post-Vedic mentions==
Soma has been mentioned in Chapter 9, verse 20 of Bhagavad Gita:
The Maharishi Mahesh Yogi&#x27;s Transcendental Meditation-Sidhi Program involves a notion of &quot;soma&quot;, said to be based on the Rigveda.

== Candidates for the plant ==
There has been much speculation as to the original &quot;Sauma&quot; plant. Candidates that have been suggested include honey, mushrooms, psychoactive and other herbal plants.

When the ritual of somayajna is held today in South India by the traditional Srautas called Somayajis, the plant used is the &quot;somalatha&quot; (Sanskrit: soma creeper, &quot;Sarcostemma acidum&quot;) which is procured as a leafless vine.

Since the late 18th century, when Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron and others made portions of the Avesta available to western scholars, several scholars have sought a representative botanical equivalent of the &quot;haoma&quot; as described in the texts and as used in living Zoroastrian practice. In the late 19th century, the highly conservative Zoroastrians of Yazd (Iran) were found to use ephedra, which was locally known as &quot;hum&quot; or &quot;homa&quot; and which they exported to the Indian Zoroastrians.

During the colonial British era scholarship, cannabis was proposed as the soma candidate by Jogesh Chandra Ray, &quot;The Soma Plant&quot; (1939) and by B. L. Mukherjee (1921).

In the late 1960s, several studies attempted to establish &quot;soma&quot; as a psychoactive substance. A number of proposals were made, including one in 1968 by the American banker R. Gordon Wasson, an amateur ethnomycologist, who asserted that &quot;soma&quot; was an inebriant but not cannabis, and suggested fly-agaric mushroom, &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;, as the likely candidate. Since its introduction in 1968, this theory has gained both detractors and followers in the anthropological literature. Wasson and his co-author, Wendy Doniger O&#x27;Flaherty, drew parallels between Vedic descriptions and reports of Siberian uses of the fly-agaric in shamanic ritual.

In 1989 Harry Falk noted that, in the texts, both &quot;haoma&quot; and &quot;soma&quot; were said to enhance alertness and awareness, did not coincide with the consciousness altering effects of an entheogen, and that &quot;there is nothing shamanistic or visionary either in early Vedic or in Old Iranian texts&quot;, Falk also asserted that the three varieties of ephedra that yield ephedrine (&quot;Ephedra gerardiana&quot;, &quot;E. major procera&quot; and &quot;E. intermedia&quot;) also have the properties attributed to &quot;haoma&quot; by the texts of the Avesta. At the conclusion of the 1999 Haoma-Soma workshop in Leiden, Jan E. M. Houben writes: &quot;despite strong attempts to do away with ephedra by those who are eager to see sauma as a hallucinogen, its status as a serious candidate for the Rigvedic Soma and Avestan Haoma still stands&quot;.

The Soviet archeologist Viktor Sarianidi wrote that he had discovered vessels and mortars used to prepare soma in Zoroastrian temples in the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex. He said that the vessels have revealed residues and seed impressions left behind during the preparation of soma. This has not been sustained by subsequent investigations. Alternatively Mark Merlin, who revisited the subject of the identity of soma more than thirty years after originally writing about it stated that there is a need of further study on links between soma and &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot;.

In &quot;Food of The Gods,&quot; Terence McKenna maintained that Soma, at least or in whole part, was a product of &quot;P. cubensis.&quot;

According to Michael Wood, the references to immortality and light are characteristics of an entheogenic experience.

<text>Brihaspati (, ), is a Hindu god. In the ancient Vedic scriptures, Brihaspati is associated with fire, and the word also refers to a god who counsels the devas and devis (gods and goddesses). In some later texts, the word refers to the largest planet of the solar system, Jupiter, and the deity is associated with the planet as a Navagraha.

==Sage==

Brihaspati appears in the Rigveda (pre-1000 BCE), such as in the dedications to him in the hymn 50 of Book 4; he is described as a sage born from the first great light, the one who drove away darkness, is bright and pure, and carries a special bow whose string is &quot;Rta&quot; or &quot;cosmic order&quot; (basis of dharma). His knowledge and character is revered, and he is considered Guru (teacher) by all the Devas. In the Vedic literature and other ancient texts, sage Brihaspati is also called by other names such as Bramanaspati, Purohita, Angirasa (son of Angiras) and Vyasa; he is sometimes identified with god Agni (fire). His wife is Tara (or goddess who personifies the stars in the sky).

The reverence for sage Brihaspati endured through the medieval period, and one of the many Dharmasastras was named after him. While the manuscripts of &quot;Brihaspati Smriti&quot; (&quot;&quot;) have not survived into the modern era, its verses were cited in other Indian texts. Scholars have made an effort to extract these cited verses, thus creating a modern reconstruction of Bṛhaspatismriti. Jolly and Aiyangar have gathered some 2,400 verses of the lost Bṛhaspatismṛti text in this manner. Brihaspati Smriti was likely a larger and more comprehensive text than Manusmriti, and the available evidence suggests that the discussion of the judicial process and jurisprudence in Brihaspati Smriti was often cited.

===Brihaspati sutras===
&quot;Brihaspati sutras&quot;, also called the &quot;Barhaspatya sutras&quot;, is an ancient Sanskrit text named after its author Brihaspati, known for its theories of materialism and anti-theism. Its tenets are at the foundation of the Charvaka school of non-orthodox Indian philosophy. The &quot;Brihaspati Sutras&quot; manuscript has been lost to history or yet to be found. However, the text is quoted in other Hindu, Buddhist and Jain texts, and this secondary literature has been the source for reconstructing the &quot;Brihaspati sutras&quot; partially.

Some scholars suggest that &quot;Brihaspati sutras&quot; are named after Brihaspati in the Vedas, but other scholars dispute this theory because the text rejects the Vedas.

==Planet==

Brihaspati as a planet (Jupiter) appears in various Hindu astronomical texts in Sanskrit, such as the 5th century &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot; by Aryabhata, the 6th century &quot;Romaka&quot; by Latadeva and &quot;Panca Siddhantika&quot; by Varahamihira, the 7th century &quot;Khandakhadyaka&quot; by Brahmagupta and the 8th century &quot;Sisyadhivrddida&quot; by Lalla. These texts present Brihaspati as one of the planets and estimate the characteristics of the respective planetary motion. Other texts such as &quot;Surya Siddhanta&quot; dated to have been complete sometime between the 5th century and 10th century present their chapters on various planets with deity mythologies.

The manuscripts of these texts exist in slightly different versions, present Brihaspati&#x27;s motion in the skies, but vary in their data, suggesting that the text were open and revised over their lives. The texts slightly disagree in their data, in their measurements of Brihaspati&#x27;s revolutions, apogee, epicycles, nodal longitudes, orbital inclination, and other parameters. For example, both &quot;Khandakhadyaka&quot; and &quot;Surya Siddhanta&quot; of Varaha state that Brihaspati completes 364,220 revolutions every 4,320,000 earth years, an Epicycle of Apsis as 32 degrees, and had an apogee (aphelia) of 160 degrees in 499 CE; while another manuscript of &quot;Surya Siddhanta&quot; accepts the revolutions to be 364,220, but revises the apogee to 171 degrees and 16 seconds and the Epicycle slightly.

The 1st millennium CE Hindu scholars had estimated the time it took for sidereal revolutions of each planet including Brihaspati, from their astronomical studies, with slightly different results:

In medieval mythologies particularly those associated with Hindu astrology, Brihaspati has a second meaning and refers to Jupiter. It became the root of the word &#x27;Brihaspativara&#x27; or Thursday in the Hindu calendar. Brihaspati as Jupiter is part of the Navagraha in the Hindu zodiac system, considered auspicious and benevolent. The word &quot;Thursday&quot; in the Greco-Roman and other Indo-European calendars is also dedicated to the planet Jupiter (god of sky and thunder). Their zodiac signs being nearly identical.

==Worship==

Jyotisha is Hindu astrology, which entails concept of Nakshatra (see also List of Natchathara temples), Navagraha (see also List of Navagraha temples and Saptarishi included in the list of Hindu deities whose dedicated temples are found at various Hindu pilgrimage sites to which Hindus take pilgrimage yatra. One of the most famous temples of Brihaspati is situated in Tanjore district of Tamil Nadu State.)

==Iconography==
The icon of Brihaspati makes his body golden, with his legs striped blue and his head covered with a halo of moon and stars. He holds different items depending on the region. In parts of South Asia he holds a container containing soma, sometimes with a tamed tiger. Elsewhere, his icon carries a stick, a lotus and beads. Brihaspati was married to Tara. In some medieval mythologies, Tara was abducted by Chandra with whom she bore a son, Budha (Mercury).

==Dedicated day==
Thursday is considered to be the dedicated day for Brihaspati. According to Hindu mythology, praying to Brihaspati on Thursday provides astrological benefits.

<text>Chandra (), also known as Soma (), is the Hindu god of the Moon, and is associated with the night, plants and vegetation. He is one of the Navagraha (nine planets of Hinduism) and Dikpala (guardians of the directions).

==Etymology and other names==

The word &quot;Chandra&quot; literally means &quot;bright, shining or glittering&quot; and is used for the &quot;Moon&quot; in Sanskrit and other Indo-Aryan languages. It is also the name of various other figures in Hindu mythology, including an asura and a Suryavamsha king. It is also a common Indian name and surname. Both male and female name variations exist in many South Asian languages that originate from Sanskrit.

Some of the synonyms of Chandra include &quot;Soma&quot; (distill), &quot;Indu&quot; (bright drop), &quot;Atrisuta&quot; (son of Atri), &quot;Shashin&quot; or &quot;Shachin&quot; (marked by hare), &quot;Taradhipa&quot; (lord of stars) and &quot;Nishakara&quot; (the night maker), &quot;Nakshatrapati&quot; (lord of the Nakshatra), &quot;Oshadhipati&quot; (lord of herbs), &quot;Uduraj or Udupati&quot; (water lord), &quot;Kumudanatha&quot; (lord of lotuses) and &quot;Udupa&quot; (boat).

===Soma===
Soma is one of the most common other names used for the deity; but the earliest use of the word to refer to the Moon is a subject of scholarly debate. Some scholars state that the word Soma is occasionally used for the Moon in the Vedas, while other scholars suggest that such usage emerged only in the post-Vedic literature. 

In the Vedas, the word Soma is primarily used for an intoxicating and energizing/healing plant drink and the deity representing it. In post-Vedic Hindu mythology, Soma is used for Chandra, who is associated with the moon and the plant. The Hindu texts state that the Moon is lit and nourished by the Sun, and that it is Moon where the divine nectar of immortality resides. In Puranas, Soma is sometimes also used to refer to Vishnu, Shiva (as &quot;Somanatha&quot;), Yama and Kubera. In some Indian texts, Soma is the name of an apsara; alternatively it is the name of any medicinal concoction, or rice-water gruel, or heaven and sky, as well as the name of certain places of pilgrimage.

Inspired by his interest in Indian mysticism, Aldous Huxley took the name for the drug used by the state in his novel &quot;Brave New World&quot; to control the population after the Vedic ritual drink Soma. 

==Mythology ==
===Vedas===
The origin of Soma is traced back to the Hindu Vedic texts, where he is the personification of a drink made from a plant with the same name. Scholars state that the plant had an important role in Vedic civilization and thus, the deity was one of the most important gods of the pantheon. In these Vedic texts, Soma is praised as the lord of plants and forests; the king of rivers and earth; and the father of the gods. The entire Mandala 9 of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; is dedicated to Soma, both the plant and the deity. The identification of Soma as a lunar deity in the Vedic texts is a controversial topic among scholars. According to William J. Wilkins, &quot;In later years the name Soma was [...] given to the moon. How and why this change took place is not known; but in the later of the Vedic hymns there is some evidence of the transition.

===Epics and Puranas===
In post Vedic texts like the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the &quot;Puranas&quot;, Soma is mentioned as a lunar deity and has many epithets including Chandra. According to most of these texts, Chandra, along with his brothers Dattatreya and Durvasa, were the sons of the sage Atri and his wife Anasuya. The &quot;Devi Bhagavata Purana&quot; states Chandra to be the avatar of the creator god Brahma. Some texts contain varying accounts regarding Chandra&#x27;s birth. According to one text, he is the son of Dharma; while another mention Prabhakar as his father. Many legends about Chandra are told in the scriptures.
One of the most prominent narratives involving Chandra centers on his illicit relationship with Tara, the wife of Brihaspati, the preceptor of the Devas. According to the story, Tara came to Chandra’s abode during her wanderings, and they fell in love with each other. Despite multiple attempts by Brihaspati to reclaim his wife, Tara remained with Chandra. Brihaspati’s disciples and even Brihaspati himself confronted Chandra, who argued that Tara had come of her own will and would leave when she desired. The situation escalated when Brihaspati sought the intervention of the Devas. Indra, the king of the Devas, threatened war to compel Chandra to return Tara. However, the Devas were divided in their opinions, and the Asuras, led by their preceptor Shukra, sided with Chandra. A fierce conflict ensued between the Devas and Asuras, resulting in cosmic turmoil. Eventually, Brahma, the creator, intervened to restore order. He admonished Chandra and Shukra, leading to the cessation of the battle. Chandra reluctantly returned Tara to Brihaspati. However, Tara was already pregnant, which gave rise to a dispute over the child&#x27;s paternity. Brahma once again intervened, questioning Tara directly. She revealed that Chandra was the father. Consequently, Brahma ordered Brihaspati to hand over the child to Chandra. The child born from this union was named Budha, who later became an important deity associated with intellect and wisdom.

Chandra is traditionally married to the 27 daughters of the sage Daksha, who personify the 27 Nakshatras (lunar mansions). These daughters are named Ashvini, Bharani, Krittika, Rohini, Mrigashira, Ardra, Punarvasu, Pushya, Ashlesha, Magha, Purvaphalguni, Uttaraphalguni, Hasta, Chitra, Swati, Vishakha, Anuradha, Jyeshtha, Mula, Purvashadha, Uttara Ashadha, Shravana, Dhanishta, Shatabhisha, Purvabhadra, Uttarabhadra, and Revati. Chandra&#x27;s movement through these Nakshatras reflects the lunar cycle and influences various astrological and ritual practices. Despite being married to all 27, Chandra showed special affection for Rohini, causing jealousy among his other wives. The preferential treatment of Rohini led the other wives to complain to their father, Daksha. Despite repeated warnings from Daksha, Chandra continued to favor Rohini. In anger, Daksha cursed Chandra to suffer from Kshayaroga (consumption or tuberculosis). This affliction impacted not just Chandra but also affected the medicinal plants and other living beings dependent on lunar influence. The Devas intervened, and after much pleading, Daksha modified his curse, allowing Chandra to be free from the disease for half of every month by bathing in the Sarasvati Tirtha. This mythological explanation accounts for the waxing and waning of the moon, with Chandra&#x27;s periodic immersion in the sacred waters symbolizing his gradual recovery and decline (&quot;Mahabharata&quot;, &quot;Shalya Parva&quot;, Chapter 35).

In the mythological narrative of the Samudra Manthan (Churning of the Ocean), the Devas and Asuras sought the Amrita (nectar of immortality). A demon named Rahu disguised himself as a Brahmin and attempted to drink the nectar. Surya (the Sun) and Chandra recognized the deception and alerted Vishnu, who severed Rahu&#x27;s head with his Sudarshana Chakra. However, because Rahu had consumed the nectar, his head and body became immortal, forming the entities Rahu and Ketu. Rahu and Ketu, bearing enmity toward Surya and Chandra for revealing their deception, periodically &quot;swallow&quot; the moon and the sun, leading to solar and lunar eclipses. This myth provides a symbolic representation of eclipses as moments of cosmic tension and conflict. During the reign of Emperor Prithu, Bhumidevi (Earth) was transformed into a cow to provide nourishment to all beings. When the sages milked Bhumidevi, Chandra served as the calf, an act which pleased Brahma. In recognition, Brahma crowned Chandra as the king of stars and medicines. This role signifies Chandra&#x27;s influence over medicinal plants and the healing arts, linking his cycles to the growth and potency of herbs.

Chandra is one of the Ashta-vasus, a group of eight elemental deities. He had four sons—Varchas, Shishira, Prana, and Ramana—with his wife Manohara. Notably, his son Varchas was later reborn as Abhimanyu, the heroic son of Arjuna in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

According to another legend, Ganesha was returning home on his mount Krauncha (a shrew) late on a full moon night after a mighty feast given by Kubera. On the journey back, a snake crossed their path and frightened by it, his mount ran away dislodging Ganesha in the process. An overstuffed Ganesha fell to the ground on his stomach, vomiting out all the Modaks he had eaten. On observing this, Chandra laughed at Ganesha. Ganesha lost his temper and broke off one of his tusks and flung it straight at the Moon, hurting him, and cursed him so that he would never be whole again. Therefore, It is forbidden to behold Chandra on Ganesh Chaturthi. This legend accounts for the Moon&#x27;s waxing and waning including a big crater on the Moon, a dark spot, visible even from Earth.

Chandra holds a crucial place in Hindu astrology (Jyotisha) and is associated with the mind, emotions, and fertility. His phases are believed to influence human behavior, agriculture, and the timing of rituals. As the luminary of the night, Chandra embodies the reflective and nurturing aspects of the cosmos, balancing the solar energies represented by Surya.

==Iconography==
Soma&#x27;s iconography varies in Hindu texts. The most common is one where he is a white-coloured deity, holding a mace in his hand, riding a chariot with three wheels and three or more white horses (up to ten).

Soma as the Moon-deity is also found in Buddhism, and Jainism.

==Zodiac and calendar==
Soma is the root of the word &quot;Somavara&quot; or Monday in the Hindu calendar. The word &quot;Monday&quot; in the Greco-Roman and other Indo-European calendars is also dedicated to the Moon. Soma is part of the Navagraha in the Hindu zodiac system. The role and importance of the Navagraha developed over time with various influences. Deifying the moon and its astrological significance occurred as early as the Vedic period and was recorded in the Vedas. The earliest work of astrology recorded in India is the Vedanga Jyotisha which began to be compiled in the 14th century BCE. The moon and various classical planets were referenced in the Atharvaveda around 1000 BCE.

The Navagraha was furthered by additional contributions from Western Asia, including Zoroastrian and Hellenistic influences. The Yavanajataka, or &#x27;Science of the Yavanas&#x27;, was written by the Indo-Greek named &quot;Yavanesvara&quot; (&quot;Lord of the Greeks&quot;) under the rule of the Western Kshatrapa king Rudrakarman I. The Navagraha would further develop and culminate in the Shaka era with the Saka, or Scythian, people. Additionally the contributions by the Saka people would be the basis of the Indian national calendar, which is also called the Saka calendar.

The Hindu calendar is a lunisolar calendar which records both lunar and solar cycles. Like the Navagraha, it was developed with the successive contributions of various works.

==Astronomy==

Soma was presumed to be a planet in Hindu astronomical texts. It is often discussed in various Sanskrit astronomical texts, such as the 5th century &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot; by Aryabhatta, the 6th century &quot;Romaka&quot; by Latadeva and &quot;Panca Siddhantika&quot; by Varahamihira, the 7th century &quot;Khandakhadyaka&quot; by Brahmagupta and the 8th century &quot;Sisyadhivrddida&quot; by Lalla. Other texts such as &quot;Surya Siddhanta&quot; dated to have been complete sometime between the 5th century and 10th century present their chapters on various planets with deity mythologies. However, they show that the Hindu scholars were aware of elliptical orbits, and the texts include sophisticated formulae to calculate its past and future positions:

:The longitude of Moon = formula_1
:– &quot;Surya Siddhanta&quot; II.39.43
:where &quot;m&quot; is the Moon&#x27;s mean longitude, a is the longitude at apogee, P is epicycle of apsis, R=3438&#x27;.

== Chandra temples ==
Besides worship in Navagraha temples, Chandra is also worshipped in the following temples (please help expand this partial list)

* Parimala Ranganatha Perumal temple: Vishnu temple with shrine for Chandra
* Kailasanathar Temple, Thingalur: Navagraha temple associated with Chandra; main deity being Shiva
* Chandramoulisvarar Temple, Arichandrapuram: Shiva temple with shrine for Chandra
* ThiruVaragunamangai Perumal Temple: Nava Tirupathi Vishnu temple associated with Chandra

==In popular culture==

Chandra plays an important role in one of the first novel-length mystery stories in English, &quot;The Moonstone&quot; (1868).
The Sanskrit word &quot;Chandrayāna&quot; (, Moon Vehicle) is used to refer to India&#x27;s lunar orbiters.

<text>In Hinduism, Daksha ( ,) is one of the &quot;Prajapati&quot;, the agents of creation, as well as a divine king-rishi. His iconography depicts him as a man with a stocky body and a handsome face or the head of a goat.

In the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, Daksha is an &quot;aditya&quot; and is associated with priestly skills. In the epics and &quot;Puranic&quot; scriptures, he is a son of the creator-god Brahma and the father of many children, who became the progenitors of various creatures. According to one legend, a resentful Daksha conducted a yajna (fire-sacrifice), and deliberately did not invite his youngest daughter Sati and her husband Shiva. In the Linga Purana, for insulting Shiva during this event, which caused Sati to self-immolate in fury, he was beheaded by Virabhadra, an attendant of Shiva. He was later resurrected with the head of a goat. Many &quot;Puranas&quot; state that Daksha was reborn to Prachetas in another &quot;Manvantara&quot; (age of Manu).

== Etymology and textual history==
The meaning of the word &quot;Daksha&quot; (दक्ष) is &quot;able&quot;, &quot;expert&quot;, &quot;skillful&quot; or &quot;honest&quot;. According to the Bhagavata Purana, Daksha got this name as he was expert in begetting children. The word also means &quot;fit&quot;, &quot;energetic&quot; and &quot;fire&quot;. Daksha also has another name &quot;Kan&quot;.

Daksha finds mentions in the ancient scripture &quot;Rigveda&quot; (2nd millennium BCE), where he is described as an Aditya (&#x27;son of the goddess Aditi&#x27;) and specifically associated with the skilled actions of sacrificers. Later in the &quot;Brahmanas&quot; (900 BCE - 700 BCE), he is identified with the creator deity Prajapati. Key elements of Daksha including his yajna and ram head, which later became a key feature in the Puranic iconography, are first found in the Taittariya Samhita. The epics—the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;—also mention Daksha. Most of the stories about Daksha are found in the &quot;Puranas&quot; (3rd - 10th century CE).

==Legends==

===Birth===
The epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot; describes Daksha and his wife emerging from the right and left thumbs of the creator god Brahma respectively. According to Matsya Purana, Daksha, Dharma, Kamadeva, and Agni were born from Brahma&#x27;s right thumb, chest, heart and eyebrows, respectively. According to many texts including the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, Daksha is born twice—First as a Manasaputra (mind-created son) of Brahma and later, as a son of Prachetas and Marisha. In contrast to the later Puranic myths, the &quot;Rig Veda&quot; states that Daksha and the goddess Aditi emerge from one another, thus he is both her son and father.

===Consorts and children===
According to many Puranic scriptures, Daksha married Prasuti in his first birth and Asikni in his second birth. Prasuti is described to be a daughter of Svayambhuva Manu, with whom Daksha had 16, 24 or 60 daughters (depending upon the scriptural source). Asikni (also referred to as Panchajani and Virani) is the daughter of another Prajapati named Virana (or Panchajana). Daksha was delegated by Brahma to inhabit the world; he went on to create Gods, Sages, Asuras, Yakshas and Rakhashas from the mind but failed to be further successful. Upon a successful penance at the Vindhyas, the god Vishnu granted Asikni as his wife and urged him to engage in sexual union.
====Sons====
According to the Puranas, Daksha and Asikni first produced five thousand sons, who were known as Haryashvas. They were interested in populating the Earth but upon the advice of Narada, took to discovering worldly affairs instead and never returned. Brahma to have consoled a grievous Daksa after this loss. Daksha and Asikni again produced another thousand sons (Shabalashvas), who had similar intentions but were persuaded by Narada to the same results. An angry Daksha cursed Narada to be a perpetual wanderer.

====Daughters====

The &quot;Puranic scriptures&quot; differ in the number of Daksha&#x27;s daughters. They were married to different deities, sages and kings, and became the progenitors of various kinds of creatures.

According to the &quot;Mahabharata (Harivamsa)&quot;, the &quot;Devi Bhagavata Purana&quot;, &quot;Brahma Vaivarta Purana&quot; and the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;, Daksha fathered 60 daughters from Asikni:
The number of Daksha&#x27;s daughters from Prasuti varies—24 daughters are mentioned in the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;, while the &quot;Linga Purana&quot; and &quot;Padma Purana&quot; list 60 daughters. All of Prasuti&#x27;s daughters represent the virtues of mind and body. The names of these daughters and their spouse, according to the Vishnu Purana, are:

Along with these daughters, the goddess of love, Rati, is also considered an offspring of Daksha. The &quot;Shiva Purana&quot; and &quot;Kalika Purana&quot; narrate that she emerged from the sweat of Daksha after he was asked by Brahma to present a wife to the love god Kama.

===Cursing Chandra===
The &quot;Puranas&quot; portray Daksha as being responsible for the waning and waxing of the Moon. The moon god Chandra married twenty-seven daughters of Daksha, who represents the twenty-seven Nakshatras (or constellations). Among them, Chandra favoured Rohini and spent most of his time with her. The other 26 sisters became jealous and complained to their father. Daksha initially tried to persuade Chandra, but after seeing his efforts fruitless, he cursed the lunar deity to become ill and lose his brightness. Since Chandra was also the god of vegetation, the vegetation began to die. The devas pacified Daksha, and upon their request, he told Chandra that he would suffer from his illness each fortnight and recover from it gradually. This leads to the waning and waxing of the moon each month. In another version, it was the god Shiva (Sati&#x27;s husband) who partially cured Chandra&#x27;s illness.

===Daksha Yajna===

The Daksha Yajna is regarded as an important turning point in the creation and development of a number of sects in Hinduism. The story describes the circumstances that replaced Sati with Parvati as Shiva&#x27;s consort and later led to the story of Ganesha and Kartikeya.

One of the daughters of Daksha, often said to be the youngest, was Sati, who had always wished to marry Shiva. Daksha forbade it, but later reluctantly allowed her and she married Shiva.

Once, Daksha organised the Brihaspatistava Yajna and intentionally did not invite Shiva and Sati. Even though discouraged by Shiva, who told her not to go to a ceremony performed by Daksha where her husband and she were not invited, the parental bond made Sati ignore social etiquette and her husband&#x27;s wishes. Sati went to the ceremony alone. She was snubbed by Daksha and insulted by him in front of the guests. Sati, unable to bear further insult, ran into the sacrificial fire and immolated herself. Shiva, upon learning about the terrible incident, in his wrath invoked Virabhadra and Bhadrakali by plucking a lock of hair and thrashing it on the ground. Virabhadra and the bhutaganas marched south and destroyed all the premises. Daksha was decapitated, and the site of the ritual was devastated during the rampage. Bhrigu, the chief priest of the Yajna, invoked the Ribhus to fight the Ganas, but the former was tied to a pillar and his beard was forcibly plucked off. According to Horace Hayman Wilson, Vahni&#x27;s hands were cut, Bhaga&#x27;s eyes were plucked out, Pusha had broken teeth, Yama&#x27;s mace was broken, Goddesses&#x27; noses were cut, Soma was pummelled, while Yajneshwara, the Indra of Swayambhuva Manvantara, tried to escape in the form of a deer, but was decapitated. Daksha also tried to escape, but Virabhadra held him and cut off his head (some legends say that he plucked off Daksha&#x27;s head with his own hands). The head was thrown to the fire, and Virabhadra returned to Kailasa, along with his hordes.

Later, Shiva was pacified. He forgave Daksha and resurrected him, but with a goat&#x27;s head. Bhrigu and the others were restored their respective parts. With Vishnu as the chief priest, Daksha offered a share of the oblations to Shiva, and the sacrifice was successfully completed.

<text>Prasuti (प्रसूति, &quot;Prasūti&quot;) is the consort of Daksha and mother of many daughters by him, including the goddess Sati. Prasuti is the daughter of Svayambhuva Manu and Shatarupa.

==Marriage and children==
According to the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;, the &quot;Linga Purana&quot; and the &quot;Padma Purana&quot;, Daksha and his wife Prasuti had many daughters (the numbers vary from 16 to 60, but most scholars consider it 24 Shraddha, Bhakti, Dhriti, Thushti, Pushti, Medha, Kriya, Buddhika, Lajja Gauri, Vapu, Santi, Siddhika, Kirtti, Khyati, Sambhuti, Smriti, Priti, Kshama, Sannati, Urjja, Svaha, Svadha, and Sati. The &quot;Padma Purana&quot; records that Daksha felt that 24 daughters were not enough and produced more 60 maidens, though these sixty daughters are mentioned as the offsprings of Asikni in other texts.
