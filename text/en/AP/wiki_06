<text>Allegan County ( ) is a county in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 120,502. The county seat is Allegan. The name was coined by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft to sound like a Native American word. Allegan County comprises the Holland, Michigan Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Grand Rapids–Kentwood–Muskegon Combined Statistical Area. It is primarily an agricultural area that is rapidly becoming urbanized as the population centers of Grand Rapids on the northeast and Kalamazoo to the southeast expand into Allegan County.

The county has long been a regional tourist draw, particularly the Tulip Time Festival in Holland and the area along Lake Michigan. The Lake Michigan shoreline has long been a popular place for vacation homes, and that development continues, especially around Saugatuck and Douglas. Another draw is Allegan State Game Area, a forest attracting campers, snowmobilers, cross-country skiers and hunters. Allegan County contains Saugatuck Dunes State Park with trails through scenic dunes and a swimming beach on Lake Michigan. The county also contains Pier Cove Park, a public beach with Lake Michigan access. Lake Allegan is a popular destination.

==History==
The Michigan peninsula was long occupied by bands of the Pottawatomi and Ojibwe of the Lake Superior Band of Chippewa Indians. The United States government forced the tribes to cede their extensive territories to the federal government, in exchange for annuities and small reservations. The federally recognized Match-e-be-nash-she-wish Band of Pottawatomi has a reservation here.

The boundaries of Allegan County were laid out by the Territorial legislature in 1831. The county was organized in 1835. At that time there were only about four European-American families in the area. Among the first settlers of Allegan County were Giles Scott and Turner Aldrich.

==Politics==
Allegan County has been strongly Republican from its start, and is very Republican even by the standards of West Michigan. Since 1884, the Republican nominee has carried the county in every presidential election except 1964. It was one of the few counties in the nation where Franklin D. Roosevelt was completely shut out in all four of his successful runs for president. FDR actually garnered fewer votes in the county in his 46-state landslide of 1936 than he did in 1932. Lyndon Johnson is the only Democrat to have carried the county since 1884, and even then only by 701 votes; it was the last time a Democrat has managed even 40 percent of the county&#x27;s vote until Barack Obama received 43.63 percent of its vote in 2008. The only other time that the Republicans lost the county in the 20th century was in 1912, when the GOP was mortally divided and Theodore Roosevelt carried it on the Bull Moose ticket.

<text>Alcona County ( ) is a county of the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the population was 10,167. Its county seat is Harrisville. Alphabetically it is the first county in Michigan; as its flag states, it is the &quot;First of 83&quot;.

==History==
The county was created by the state legislature on April 1, 1840. It was at first named Negwegon County, after the name of a well-known Chippewa chief, also known as &quot;Little Wing&quot;. He was honored as having been an American ally against the British in the War of 1812.

It was renamed to Alcona County on March 8, 1843, after a neologism created by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft from parts of words from Native American languages, plus Arabic, Greek and Latin. These were amalgamated to mean &quot;fine or excellent plain&quot;. He was an influential US Indian agent and geographer.

Alcona County was initially attached to Mackinac County for purposes of revenue, taxation, and judicial matters. The attachment shifted to Cheboygan County in 1853, to Alpena County in 1857, to Iosco County in 1858, and to Alpena County in 1859.

Harrisville Township, then comprising the entire county, was organized in 1860. County government was organized in 1869, becoming effective on May 8, 1869. The county&#x27;s slogan on its seal (a single gold star on a green field in the shape of Alcona County) is &quot;First of 83,&quot; which refers to its place alphabetically among Michigan counties.

In 2007, Alcona County discovered that $1.2 million was missing and was forced to alter its $4 million budget. An investigation revealed that Thomas Katona, who had been the county treasurer for thirteen years, had wired $186,500 of county funds to accounts associated with a well-known Nigerian scam. Katona, who had already lost more than $70,000 of his savings on the scam, ignored repeated warnings from friends and his bank that his so-called investments seemed suspicious.

Katona was sentenced to 9–14 years imprisonment on June 12, 2007, by the 23rd Circuit Court. Judge William Myles said Katona&#x27;s crimes warranted more severe punishment than called for in state sentencing guidelines, due to the amount of money involved and the number of victims in the case.

<text>Roland Stephen Taylor (born December 9, 1957) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, music executive, film maker, assistant professor, and actor. A figure in what has come to be known as Christian alternative rock, Taylor enjoyed a successful solo career during the 1980s, and also served in the short-lived group Chagall Guevara. In contrast to many Christian musical artists, his songs have often taken aim at Christian hypocrisy or &quot;error&quot; with the use of satirical, sardonic lyrics. In 1997, he founded the record label Squint Entertainment, which fueled the careers of artists such as Sixpence None the Richer, Chevelle, and Burlap to Cashmere. Despite this success, Taylor was ousted from the label by its parent, Word Entertainment, in 2001. He has produced and written for numerous musical acts, one of the most consistent being Newsboys. As a film-maker, Taylor co-wrote, directed, and produced the feature films &quot;Down Under the Big Top&quot;, &quot;The Second Chance&quot;, and &quot;Blue Like Jazz&quot;. After a decade and a half of hiatus, Taylor returned to performing music in 2010 as the front-man for Steve Taylor &amp; The Perfect Foil, a supergroup he founded with Peter Furler, Jimmy Abegg, and John Mark Painter. Along with a university residency and continued filmmaking, Taylor would resume work on unfinished Chagall Guevara material into the 2020s.

== Biography ==

===Early life===

Taylor, the eldest of three children, was born in Brawley, California. Taylor&#x27;s father, Roland Taylor, was a Baptist minister. When Taylor was six years old, the family relocated to Northglenn, Colorado, a suburb of Denver. He graduated from Northglenn High School in 1976. While there, he attempted to learn the bass guitar, piano and trombone.

Upon graduation from high school, Taylor enrolled at Biola University in California. During his first year, he was first of the 100 chosen, from 20,000 applicants, to spend the summer at John Davidson&#x27;s summer camp. At the camp, Taylor spent time learning from singers like Tony Orlando, Florence Henderson, and John Davidson.

Taylor returned home and enrolled at the University of Colorado Boulder, to study &quot;serious music&quot;. He graduated there in 1980, but described his Bachelor of Arts degree in music and theater as being worth &quot;slightly more than the cash value of a Pizza Hut coupon.&quot;

===1980s===

In 1980, Taylor wrote and directed a pop musical comedy titled &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot; based on the parable of the Prodigal Son from the Bible. It had a short run at a community theater in Denver. He also wrote and starred in a short film, &quot;Joe&#x27;s Distributing&quot;, a parody of avant-garde films.

Taylor wrote articles during this time that were published in &quot;The Wittenburg Door&quot; and &quot;CCM Magazine&quot; (for which he won an award from the Evangelical Press Association).

After recording a demo of original songs, Taylor began to write for the musical group the Continental Singers. The Continental Singers&#x27; founder, Cam Floria invited Taylor to join the group as assistant director on a tour to France, Italy, and Poland sponsored by Solidarity.

When he returned to the United States, he was asked to perform at the Christian Artists&#x27; 1982 Music Seminar in Denver. Billy Ray Hearn, president of Sparrow Records, was backstage and immediately signed Taylor to a recording contract.

He recorded his debut solo project &quot;I Want to Be a Clone&quot; in 1982 and released it in January 1983. He quickly gained a reputation for writing songs that satirized beliefs and practices with which he disagreed.

In 1983, Taylor recorded his first full-length album. Released in 1984, &quot;Meltdown&quot; included some of the demo material that was not on &quot;Clone&quot; along with some new material. His video single of the title track, &quot;Meltdown (at Madame Tussauds)&quot; was played on MTV, which was unusual for a Christian artist at the time. The video featured an appearance by actress Lisa Whelchel. The album also included &quot;We Don&#x27;t Need No Colour Code&quot;, which was critical of Bob Jones University and its anti-interracial dating policy, a policy that was not abandoned by the university until 2000.

Another track on &quot;Meltdown&quot;, &quot;Guilty By Association&quot;, one of the original demo songs, includes a jab with an impression in the middle eight at televangelist Jimmy Swaggart. The song &quot;On the Fritz&quot;, the title track from Taylor&#x27;s next studio album, was also targeted at Swaggart. Swaggart later struck back by devoting part of a chapter of &quot;Religious Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll, a Wolf in Sheep&#x27;s Clothing&quot; () to Taylor, whom he saw as playing evil rock music.

During a performance at 1984&#x27;s Cornerstone Festival, Taylor fractured his ankle while jumping off the stage. He finished the summer&#x27;s tour in an electric wheelchair.

In 1985, Taylor received his first Grammy nomination in the &quot;Best Male Gospel Performance&quot; category, while also being nominated for Dove Awards as &quot;Gospel Artist of the Year&quot; and for &quot;Meltdown&quot; as the &quot;Best Contemporary Album of the Year&quot;. Taylor and &quot;Some Band&quot; performed at the Dove Awards ceremonies in Nashville in April of that year, where they were introduced by Pat Boone.

Taylor followed that release with &quot;On the Fritz&quot;, produced by Foreigner&#x27;s Ian McDonald. &quot;Fritz&quot; was Taylor&#x27;s first album to use all studio musicians instead of his usual backing group. Some of the musicians who played on this album were George Small, Tony DaVilio, Hugh McCracken, Carmine Rojas, Larry Fast and Allen Childs. &quot;Fritz&quot;, keeping with Taylor tradition, took aim once again at religious leaders, such as Bill Gothard (&quot;I Manipulate&quot;), greedy TV evangelists (again) (&quot;You Don&#x27;t Owe Me Nothing&quot;), politicians using religion or avoiding questions of morality in order to get votes (&quot;It&#x27;s a Personal Thing&quot;), and public schools teaching &quot;values clarification&quot; to children, asking them to determine who should be thrown overboard in an overcrowded lifeboat (&quot;Lifeboat&quot;).

Taylor also recorded a duet with Sheila Walsh, &quot;Not Gonna Fall Away&quot;, a tune written and recorded in 1981 by David Edwards. This was released as a 12&quot; single titled &quot;Transatlantic Remixes&quot;. Taylor and Walsh embarked on the Transatlantic Tour which included dates in the United Kingdom and the United States.

Taylor and Walsh also participated in the recording of &quot;Do Something Now&quot; in 1985, a collaborative effort, similar to &quot;We Are the World&quot;, to raise money for Compassion International&#x27;s famine relief programs in Africa. Other artists participating included Amy Grant, Larry Norman, Russ Taff, Randy Stonehill, Mylon LeFevre, Steve Camp, Evie, Phil Keaggy, 2nd Chapter of Acts, Sandi Patty, Bill Gaither and Rick Cua.

In between performing, recording and touring, Taylor met and married Debbie Butler of Irvine, California. They were married by Taylor&#x27;s father at a private ceremony in Connecticut. Mrs. Taylor designed the album cover for a compilation on Sparrow, &quot;The Best We Could Find (Plus 3 That Never Escaped)&quot; and Myrrh&#x27;s &quot;I Predict 1990&quot;, as well as some of Taylor&#x27;s more colorful stage costumes.

In 1987, Taylor once again lived up to his controversial reputation with a song called &quot;I Blew Up the Clinic Real Good&quot;. The song criticizes anyone who claims to be a anti-abortion activist who would blow up abortion clinics or kill doctors. The point of the song was lost on many and resulted in Taylor&#x27;s album, &quot;I Predict 1990&quot;, being pulled from the shelves at some Christian record stores. Taylor himself would occasionally call those stores to explain the song to them. With &quot;1990&quot;, Taylor&#x27;s targets included mainstream universities (&quot;Since I Gave Up Hope I Feel a Lot Better&quot;, featuring fiddle work from Papa John Creach of Jefferson Airplane and Hot Tuna). Other tracks included &quot;Jim Morrison&#x27;s Grave&quot;, which once again brought Taylor some MTV exposure, and the Flannery O&#x27;Connor inspired &quot;Harder to Believe Than Not To&quot;. Some stores also pulled the album as they thought the cover looked like a tarot card.

Taylor&#x27;s tour for &quot;I Predict&quot; was his most ambitious to date, bringing him to Australia, Canada, England, Finland, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, Sweden and the Philippines.

===1990s===

Taylor then took a break from music until 1990, when he returned as the lead singer of Chagall Guevara. Their first recording was &quot;Tale o&#x27; the Twister&quot;, which appeared on the soundtrack to the 1990 film &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot;. The band released an album, the self-titled &quot;Chagall Guevara&quot;, in 1991 on MCA Records. A follow-up album was begun, but it was not finished until 2022 as part of a Kickstarter campaign. The band was released from its contract, following slow sales for their debut, and broke up.

Taylor returned with another solo album, &quot;Squint&quot;, and a live CD, &quot;Liver&quot;, in the mid-1990s. &quot;Squint&quot; included the track &quot;Smug&quot;, which uses the persona of Rush Limbaugh as an apparent-&quot;example&quot; of smugness, and uses Barbra Streisand as an iconic master of &quot;apparent&quot;-smugness. The album also included the song &quot;Cash Cow&quot;, which takes a jab at yet another televangelist, Robert Tilton, as well as &quot;Bannerman&quot; which is a tribute to American Football fans that hold up &quot;John 3:16&quot; banners behind the goalposts.

A tribute to Taylor entitled &quot;I Predict a Clone: A Steve Taylor Tribute&quot; was released in 1994 that featured performances by Sixpence None the Richer, Fleming and John, Starflyer 59, Circle of Dust, and others.

In the years following those releases, Taylor focused his efforts on running Squint Entertainment and producing projects for other artists, including Sixpence None the Richer&#x27;s self-titled 1997 release that featured the hit singles &quot;Kiss Me&quot; and a cover of The La&#x27;s &quot;There She Goes&quot;. He would be most noted for his work with Newsboys, co-producing five of the band&#x27;s albums while making contributions to the band&#x27;s songwriting. During this time, Taylor also directed and produced the Newsboys&#x27; 1996 movie &quot;Down Under the Big Top&quot; in which the band stars.

Taylor began working as a full-time film maker, directing music videos for Fleming and John, Rich Mullins, Sixpence None the Richer, Newsboys, Guardian, Twila Paris, Dakoda Motor Co., Out of the Grey, and two video albums for himself.

===2000s===

While still running Squint, Taylor had begun a film project called &quot;St. Gimp&quot;, co-written with Ben Pearson and Willie Williams. That film was abandoned in 2001 when Squint Entertainment lost its financial backing and Taylor was forced out of the company. Taylor co-wrote and directed the feature film &quot;The Second Chance&quot; starring Michael W. Smith, released February 17, 2006. He also appeared in the documentary film &quot;Why Should the Devil Have All the Good Music?&quot; (released on DVD in 2006), in interview segments and performing part of &quot;We Don&#x27;t Need No Colour Code&quot;. New music was scarce, but Taylor did contribute one song, &quot;Shortstop&quot;, to Squint&#x27;s 2000 compilation &quot;Roaring Lambs&quot;. He also recorded &quot;Yo Ho Hero&quot;, a collaborative track for the 2008 VeggieTales movie &quot;The Pirates Who Don&#x27;t Do Anything&quot;.

===2010s===

In 2010, Taylor began working on a film adaptation of Donald Miller&#x27;s book &quot;Blue Like Jazz&quot;. Kickstarter donations helped finish the project, and the film was released theatrically on April 13, 2012, and on DVD/Blu-ray on August 7, 2012. 

June 2011 saw the release of &quot;Closer&quot; (featuring Steve Taylor and Some Other Band), a collaboration with Peter Furler on his first solo album, &quot;On Fire&quot;. The group consisted of Taylor on vocals, Jimmy Abegg on guitar, John Mark Painter on bass, and Furler on drums. According to Furler, an entire album was recorded from these sessions, the material consisting of Taylor/Furler songs unused by the Newsboys. One track from the group, &quot;A Life Preserved&quot;, was released August 7, 2012 on the &quot;Blue Like Jazz&quot; Motion Picture Soundtrack album and credited to Steve Taylor &amp; The Perfect Foil. An &quot;official remix&quot; of &quot;A Life Preserved&quot; also surfaced at pastemagazine.com, and Taylor returned to the stage for Creation 2013 festival. A 2013 Kickstarter drive funded the band in studio and on the road.

A February 2014 Kickstarter update revealed previously completed studio work to be an album by tour co-headliner Peter Furler Band (released March 2014), with the four members of the Perfect Foil as producers. Soon after, Steve Taylor &amp; The Perfect Foil announced via Kickstarter that their own new album &quot;Goliath&quot; was completed August 23, 2014. This marked Taylor&#x27;s first studio album in twenty years. &quot;Only a Ride&quot;, the debut single from the album, was released via streaming and mp3 download on September 16, 2014, only to Kickstarter campaign supporters. The music video for &quot;Only a Ride&quot; featured scenes from the film trailer for &quot;Stunt Rock&quot;, a 1980 film by director Brian Trenchard-Smith. Music videos for &quot;Standing in Line&quot; and the title track to &quot;Goliath&quot; followed. The album, distributed independently, through Taylor&#x27;s own Splint Entertainment, was released on November 18, 2014. Plans for extensive touring were announced.

In June 2015, Taylor and the Perfect Foil entered Electrical Audio in Chicago with Daniel Smith of Danielson and engineer Steve Albini. In December 2015, Taylor announced (via Kickstarter) that the resulting EP, &quot;Wow to the Deadness&quot;, was released in January 2016, under the name Steve Taylor &amp; The Danielson Foil.

Along with new music making, Taylor also had the honor of becoming filmmaker-in-residence at Lipscomb University&#x27;s cinematic arts program. His roles would include assistant professor of film &amp; creative media and director of the School of Theatre and Cinematic Arts. He would also begin development on another feature film, a political comedy: &quot;The Independent&quot;.

===2020s===

On August 1, 2020, a live crowdfunding campaign was launched for the release of &quot;The Last Amen&quot;, the long-delayed Chagall Guevara live album. It was to be accompanied by a collection, &quot;Halcyon Days&quot;, to include rare and unreleased CG material as well as new recordings with Taylor&#x27;s former band. The latter nine-track release was made available to Kickstarter backers in mid-May 2022, and was released to the public in June of that year. The band played one show together on July 2, 2022 to celebrate the release of the new album.

<text>Tigrinya (), sometimes spelled Tigrigna, is an Ethio-Semitic language commonly spoken in Eritrea and in northern Ethiopia&#x27;s Tigray Region by the Tigrinya and Tigrayan peoples respectively. It is also spoken by the global diaspora of these regions.

== History and literature ==
Although it differs markedly from the Geʽez (Classical Ethiopic) language, for instance in having phrasal verbs, and in using a word order that places the main verb last instead of first in the sentence, there is a strong influence of Geʽez on Tigrinya literature, especially with terms relating to Christian life, Biblical names, and so on. Ge&#x27;ez, because of its status in Eritrean and Ethiopian culture, and possibly also its simple structure, acted as a literary medium until relatively recent times.

The earliest written example of Tigrinya is a text of local laws found in the district of Logosarda, Debub Region in Southern Eritrea, which dates from the 13th century.

In Eritrea, during British administration, the Ministry of Information put out a weekly newspaper in Tigrinya that cost 5 cents and sold 5,000 copies weekly. At the time, it was reported to be the first of its kind.

Tigrinya (along with Arabic) was one of Eritrea&#x27;s official languages during its short-lived federation with Ethiopia. In 1958, it was replaced by the Southern Ethiopic language Amharic prior to Eritrea&#x27;s annexation. Upon Eritrea&#x27;s independence in 1991, Tigrinya retained the status of working language in the country. Eritrea was the only state in the world to officially recognize Tigrinya until 2020, when Ethiopia made changes to recognize Tigrinya on a national level.

== Speakers==
There is no general name for the people who speak Tigrinya. In Eritrea, Tigrinya speakers are officially known as the () or Tigrinya people. In Ethiopia, a Tigrayan, that is a native of Tigray, who also speaks the Tigrinya language, is referred to in Tigrinya as (male), (female), (plural). Bəher roughly means &quot;nation&quot; in the ethnic sense of the word in Tigrinya, Tigre, Amharic and Ge&#x27;ez. The Jeberti in Eritrea also speak Tigrinya.

Tigrinya is the most widely spoken language in Eritrea (see Demographics of Eritrea), and the fourth most spoken language in Ethiopia after Amharic, Oromo, and Somali. It is also spoken by large immigrant communities around the world, in countries including Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. In Australia, Tigrinya is one of the languages broadcast on public radio via the multicultural Special Broadcasting Service.

Tigrinya dialects differ phonetically, lexically, and grammatically. No dialect appears to be accepted as a standard. Even though the most spread and used in, for example books, movies and news is the Asmara dialect.

== Phonology ==
For the representation of Tigrinya sounds, this article uses a modification of a system that is common (though not universal) among linguists who work on Ethiopian Semitic languages, but differs somewhat from the conventions of the International Phonetic Alphabet.

=== Consonant phonemes ===
Tigrinya has a fairly typical set of phonemes for an Ethiopian Semitic language. That is, there is a set of ejective consonants and the usual seven-vowel system. Unlike many of the modern Ethiopian Semitic languages, Tigrinya has preserved the two pharyngeal consonants which were apparently part of the ancient Geʽez language and which, along with , voiceless velar ejective fricative or voiceless uvular ejective fricative, make it easy to distinguish spoken Tigrinya from related languages such as Amharic, though not from Tigre, which has also maintained the pharyngeal consonants.

The charts below show the phonemes of Tigrinya. The sounds are shown using the same system for representing the sounds as in the rest of the article. When the IPA symbol is different, the orthography is indicated in brackets.


=== Vowel phonemes ===
The sounds are shown using the same system for representing the sounds as in the rest of the article. When the IPA symbol is different, the orthography is indicated in brackets.

=== Gemination ===
Gemination, the doubling of a consonantal sound, is meaningful in Tigrinya, i.e. it affects the meaning of words. While gemination plays an important role in the morphology of the Tigrinya verb, it is normally accompanied by other marks. But there is a small number of pairs of words which are only differentiable from each other by gemination, e.g. , (); , (). All consonants, with the exception of the pharyngeal and glottal ones, can be geminated.

=== Allophones ===
The velar consonants and are pronounced differently when they appear immediately after a vowel and are not geminated. In these circumstances, is pronounced as a velar fricative. is pronounced as a fricative, or sometimes as an affricate. This fricative or affricate is more often pronounced further back, in the uvular place of articulation (although it is represented in this article as ). All of these possible realizations – velar ejective fricative, uvular ejective fricative, velar ejective affricate and uvular ejective affricate – are cross-linguistically very rare sounds.

Since these two sounds are completely conditioned by their environments, they can be considered allophones of and . This is especially clear from verb roots in which one consonant is realized as one or the other allophone depending on what precedes it. For example, for the verb meaning , which has the triconsonantal root √b-k-y, there are forms such as () and (), and for the verb meaning , which has the triconsonantal root √s-r-kʼ, there are forms such as () and ().

What is especially interesting about these pairs of phones is that they are distinguished in Tigrinya orthography. Because allophones are completely predictable, it is quite unusual for them to be represented with distinct symbols in the written form of a language.

=== Syllables ===
A Tigrinya syllable may consist of a consonant-vowel or a consonant-vowel-consonant sequence. When three consonants (or one geminated consonant and one simple consonant) come together within a word, the cluster is broken up with the introduction of an epenthetic vowel , and when two consonants (or one geminated consonant) would otherwise end a word, the vowel appears after them, or (when this happens because of the presence of a suffix) is introduced before the suffix.
For example,

Stress is neither contrastive nor particularly salient in Tigrinya. It seems to depend on gemination, but it has apparently not been systematically investigated.

== Grammar ==
=== Typical grammatical features ===
Grammatically, Tigrinya is a typical Ethiopian Semitic (ES) language in most ways:
* A Tigrinya noun is treated as either masculine or feminine. However, most inanimate nouns do not have a fixed gender.
* Tigrinya nouns have plural, as well as singular, forms, though the plural is not obligatory when the linguistic or pragmatic context makes the number clear. As in Tigre and Geez (as well as Arabic), noun plurals may be formed through internal changes (&quot;broken&quot; plural) as well as through the addition of suffixes. For example, , .
* Adjectives behave in most ways like nouns. Most Tigrinya adjectives, like those in Tigre and Ge&#x27;ez, have feminine and plural (both genders) forms. For example, , , 
* Within personal pronouns and subject agreement inflections on verbs, gender is distinguished in second person as well as third. For example, , .
* Possessive adjectives take the form of noun suffixes: , , .
* Verbs are based on consonantal roots, most consisting of three consonants: √sbr , , , .
* Within the tense system there is a basic distinction between the perfective form—conjugated with suffixes and denoting the past—and the imperfective form—conjugated with prefixes and in some cases suffixes—and denoting the present or future: , .
* As in Ge&#x27;ez and Amharic, there is also a separate &quot;gerundive&quot; form of the verb, conjugated with suffixes and used to link verbs within a sentence: .
* Verbs also have a separate jussive/imperative form, similar to the imperfective: .
* Through the addition of derivational morphology (internal changes to verb stems and/or prefixes), verbs may be made passive, reflexive, causative, frequentative, reciprocal, or reciprocal causative: &quot;fäläṭ-u&quot; &#x27;they knew&#x27;, &quot;tä-fälṭ-u&quot; &#x27;they were known&#x27;, &quot;a-fälṭ-u&quot; &#x27;they caused to know (they introduced)&#x27;, &quot;tä-faläṭ-u&quot; &#x27;they knew each other&#x27;, &quot;a-f-faläṭ-u&quot; &#x27;they caused to know each other&#x27;.
* Verbs may take direct object and prepositional pronoun suffixes: &quot;fäläṭä-nni&quot; &#x27;he knew me&#x27;, &quot;fäläṭä-lläy&quot; &#x27;he knew for me&#x27;.
* Negation is expressed through the prefix &quot;ay-&quot; and, in independent clauses, the suffix &quot;-n&quot;: &quot;ay-fäläṭä-n&quot; &#x27;he didn&#x27;t know&#x27;.
* The copula and the verb of existence in the present are irregular: &quot;allo&quot; &#x27;there is, he exists&#x27;, &quot;ǝyyu&quot; &#x27;he is&#x27;, or &quot;yällän&quot; or &quot;yälbon&quot; &#x27;there isn&#x27;t, he doesn&#x27;t exist&#x27;, &quot;aykʷänän&quot; &#x27;he isn&#x27;t, it isn&#x27;t&#x27;, &quot;näbärä&quot; &#x27;he existed, he was, there was&#x27;, &quot;yǝ-ḵäwwǝn&quot; &#x27;he will be&#x27;, &quot;yǝ-näbbǝr&quot; &#x27;he will exist, there will be&#x27;.
* The verb of existence together with object suffixes for the possessor expresses possession (&#x27;have&#x27;) and obligation (&#x27;must&#x27;): &quot;allo-nni&quot; &#x27;I have, I must&#x27; (lit. &#x27;there is (to) me&#x27;).
* Relative clauses are expressed by a prefix attached to the verb: &quot;zǝ-fäläṭä&quot; &#x27;who knew&#x27;
* Cleft sentences, with relative clauses normally following the copula, are very common: &quot;män ǝyyu zǝ-fäläṭä&quot; &#x27;who knew?&#x27; (lit. &#x27;who is he who knew?&#x27;).
* There is an accusative marker used on definite direct objects. In Tigrinya this is the prefix &quot;nǝ-&quot;. For example, &quot;ḥagʷäs nǝ’almaz räḵibuwwa&quot; &#x27;Hagos met Almaz&#x27;.
* As in other modern Ethiopian Semitic languages, the default word order in clauses is subject–object–verb, and noun modifiers usually (though not always in Tigrinya) precede their head nouns.

=== Innovations ===
Tigrinya grammar is unique within the Ethiopian Semitic language family in several ways:
* For second-person pronouns, there is a separate vocative form, used to get a person&#x27;s attention: &quot;nǝssǝḵa&quot; &#x27;you (m.sg.)&#x27;, &quot;atta&quot; &#x27;you! (m.sg.)&#x27;.
* There is a definite article, related (as in English) to the demonstrative adjective meaning &#x27;that&#x27;: &quot;ǝta gʷal&quot; &#x27;the girl&#x27;.
* The gerundive form is used for past tense, as well as for the linking function as in Ge&#x27;ez and Amharic: &quot;täzaribu&quot; &#x27;(he) speaking, he spoke&#x27;.
* Yes–no questions are marked by the particle &quot;do&quot; following the questioned word or the verb, if there is none: &quot;ḥaftäydo rǝiḵi&quot; &#x27;did you (f.sg.) see my sister?&#x27;.
* The negative circumfix &quot;ay- -n&quot; may mark nouns, pronouns, and adjectives as well as verbs: &quot;ay-anä-n&quot; &#x27;not me&#x27;, &quot;ayabǝy-ǝn&quot; &#x27;not big&#x27;
* Tigrinya has an unusually complex tense–aspect–mood system, with many nuances achieved using combinations of the three basic aspectual forms (perfect, imperfect, gerundive) and various auxiliary verbs including the copula ( &quot;ǝyyu&quot;, etc.), the verb of existence ( &quot;allo&quot;, etc.), and the verbs &quot;näbärä&quot; &#x27;exist, live&#x27;, &quot;konä&quot; &#x27;become&#x27;, &quot;s&#x27;änḥe&quot; &#x27;stay&#x27;.
* Tigrinya has compound prepositions corresponding to the preposition–postposition compounds found in Amharic: ab lǝli arat&quot; &#x27;on (top of) the bed&#x27;, ab tǝḥti arat&quot; &#x27;under the bed&#x27;
* Unlike most Ethiopian Semitic languages, Tigrinya has only one set of applicative suffixes, used both for the dative and benefactive and for locative and adversative senses: &quot;täq̱ämmiṭa-llu&quot; &#x27;she sat down for him&#x27; or &#x27;she sat down on it&#x27; or &#x27;she sat down to his detriment&#x27;.

== Writing system ==
Tigrinya is written in the Geʽez script, originally developed for Geez. The Ethiopic script is an abugida: each symbol represents a consonant+vowel syllable, and the symbols are organized in groups of similar symbols on the basis of both the consonant and the vowel. In the table below the columns are assigned to the seven vowels of Tigrinya; they appear in the traditional order. The rows are assigned to the consonants, again in the traditional order.

For each consonant in an abugida, there is an unmarked symbol representing that consonant followed by a canonical or inherent vowel. For the Ethiopic abugida, this canonical vowel is &quot;ä,&quot; the first column in the table. However, since the pharyngeal and glottal consonants of Tigrinya (and other Ethiopian Semitic languages) cannot be followed by this vowel, the symbols in the first column for those consonants are pronounced with the vowel &quot;a,&quot; exactly as in the fourth column. These redundant symbols are falling into disuse in Tigrinya and are shown with a dark gray background in the table. When it is necessary to represent a consonant with no following vowel, the &quot;consonant&quot;+&quot;ə&quot; form is used (the symbol in the sixth column). For example, the word &quot;ǝntay&quot; &#x27;what?&#x27; is written , literally ǝ-nǝ-ta-yǝ.

Since some of the distinctions that were apparently made in Ge&#x27;ez have been lost in Tigrinya, there are two rows of symbols each for the consonants ‹ḥ›, ‹s›, and ‹sʼ›. In Eritrea, for ‹s› and ‹sʼ›, at least, one of these has fallen into disuse in Tigrinya and is now considered old-fashioned. These less-used series are shown with a dark gray background in the chart.

The orthography does not mark gemination, so the pair of words &quot;qärräbä&quot; &#x27;he approached&#x27;, &quot;qäräbä&quot; &#x27;he was near&#x27; are both written . Since such minimal pairs are very rare, this presents no problem to readers of the language.

<doc id="95135" wikidata="Q28244" url="?curid=95135" title="Amharic">
<text>Amharic ( or ; , ) is an Ethiopian Semitic language, which is a subgrouping within the Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic languages. It is spoken as a first language by the Amharas, and also serves as a lingua franca for all other populations residing in major cities and towns in Ethiopia.

The language serves as the official working language of the Ethiopian federal government, and is also the official or working language of several of Ethiopia&#x27;s federal regions. In 2020 in Ethiopia, it had over 33.7 million mother-tongue speakers of which 31 million are ethnically Amhara, and more than 25.1 million second language speakers in 2019, making the total number of speakers over 58.8 million. Amharic is the largest, most widely spoken language in Ethiopia, and the second most spoken mother-tongue in Ethiopia (after Oromo). Amharic is also the second most widely spoken Semitic language in the world (after Arabic).

Amharic is written left-to-right using a system that grew out of the Geʽez script. The segmental writing system in which consonant-vowel sequences are written as units is called an &quot;abugida&quot; (). The graphemes are called &quot;fidäl&quot; (), which means &quot;script&quot;, &quot;alphabet&quot;, &quot;letter&quot;, or &quot;character&quot;.

There is no universally agreed-upon Romanization of Amharic into Latin script. The Amharic examples in the sections below use one system that is common among linguists specializing in Ethiopian Semitic languages.

== Background ==
Amharic has been the official working language of Ethiopia, language of the courts, the language of trade and everyday communications and of the military since the late 12th century. The Amhara nobles supported the Zagwe prince Lalibela in his power struggle against his brothers which led him to make Amharic &quot;Lessana Negus&quot; as well as fill the Amhara nobles in the top positions of his Kingdom. The appellation of &quot;language of the king&quot; (; &quot;Lǝssanä nägaśi,&quot; &quot;Yä-nägaśi qʷanqʷa&quot;) and its use in the royal court are otherwise traced to the Amhara Emperor Yekuno Amlak. It is one of the official languages of Ethiopia, together with other regions like Oromo, Somali, Afar, and Tigrinya. Amharic is an Afro-Asiatic language of the Southwest Semitic group and is related to Geʽez, or Ethiopic, the liturgical language of the Ethiopian Orthodox church; Amharic is written in a slightly modified form of the alphabet used for writing the Geʽez language. There are 34 basic characters, each of which has seven forms depending on which vowel is to be pronounced in the syllable. There are also 49 &quot;wa&quot; letters, which form compound sounds involving &quot;w.&quot; All together, the alphabet has some 280 letters. Until 2020 Amharic was the sole official language of Ethiopia. The 2007 census reported that Amharic was spoken by 21.6 million native speakers in Ethiopia. More recent sources state the number of first-language speakers in 2018 as nearly 32 million, with another 25 million second-language speakers in Ethiopia. Additionally, 3 million emigrants outside of Ethiopia speak the language. Most of the Ethiopian Jewish communities in Ethiopia and Israel speak Amharic. Furthermore, Amharic is considered a holy language by the Rastafari religion and is widely used among its followers worldwide.
=== Linguistic development theory ===

Early Afro-Asiatic populations speaking proto-Semitic, proto-Cushitic and proto-Omotic languages would have diverged by the fourth or fifth millennium BC. Shortly afterwards, the proto-Cushitic and proto-Omotic groups would have settled in the Ethiopian highlands, with the proto-Semitic speakers crossing the Sinai Peninsula into Asia. A later return movement of peoples from South Arabia would have introduced the Semitic languages to Ethiopia. Based on archaeological evidence, the presence of Semitic speakers in the territory date to some time before 500 BC. Linguistic analysis suggests the presence of Semitic languages in Ethiopia as early as 2000 BC. Levine indicates that by the end of that millennium, the core inhabitants of Greater Ethiopia would have consisted of dark-skinned agropastoralists speaking Afro-Asiatic languages of the Semitic, Cushitic and Omotic branches.

Other scholars such as Messay Kebede and Daniel E. Alemu argue that migration across the Red Sea was defined by reciprocal exchange, if it even occurred at all, and that Ethio-Semitic-speaking ethnic groups should not be characterized as foreign invaders.

Amharic is a South Ethio-Semitic language, along with Gurage, Argobba, Harari, and others. Due to the social stratification of the time, the Cushitic Agaw adopted the South Ethio-Semitic language and eventually absorbed the Semitic population. Amharic thus developed with a Cushitic substratum and a Semitic superstratum. The northernmost South Ethio-Semitic speakers, or the proto-Amhara, remained in constant contact with their North Ethio-Semitic neighbors, evidenced by linguistic analysis and oral traditions. A 7th century southward shift of the center of gravity of the Kingdom of Aksum and the ensuing integration and Christianization of the proto-Amhara also resulted in a high prevalence of Geʽez sourced lexicon in Amharic. Some time after the 9th century AD, Amharic diverged from its closest relative, Argobba, probably due to religious differences as the Argobba adopted Islam.

In 1983, Lionel Bender proposed that Amharic may have been constructed as a pidgin as early as the 4th century AD to enable communication between Aksumite soldiers speaking Semitic, Cushitic, and Omotic languages, but this hypothesis has not garnered widespread acceptance. The preservation in Old Amharic of VSO word order and gutturals typical of Semitic languages, Cushitic influences shared with other Ethio-Semitic languages (especially those of the Southern branch), and the number of geographically distinct Cushitic languages that have influenced Amharic at different points in time (e.g. Oromo influence beginning in the 16th century) support a natural evolution of Amharic from a Proto-Ethio-Semitic language with considerable Cushitic influences (similar to Gurage, Tigrinya, etc.).

== Phonology ==

The Amharic ejective consonants correspond to the Proto-Semitic &quot;emphatic consonants.&quot; In the Ethiopianist tradition they are often transcribed with a dot below the letter. 
The notation of central vowels in the Ethiopianist tradition is shown in angled brackets.

=== Allophones ===
The voiced bilabial plosive /b/ is phonetically realized as a voiced labial approximant [β̞] medially between sonorants in non-geminated form. The fricative ejective // is heard as a fricative ejective [], but is mostly heard as the affricate sound []. The rhotic consonant is realized as a trill when geminated and a tap otherwise. The closed central unrounded vowel /ɨ/ and mid-central vowel /ə/ are generally fronted to ɪ] and ɛ], respectively, following palatal consonants, and generally retracted and rounded to ʊ] and ɔ], respectively, following labialized velar consonants.

==Writing system==

The Amharic script is an abugida, and the graphemes of the Amharic writing system are called . It is derived from a modification of the Geʽez script. Each character represents a consonant+vowel sequence, but the basic shape of each character is determined by the consonant, which is modified for the vowel. Some consonant phonemes are written by more than one series of characters: , , , and (the last one has &quot;four&quot; distinct letter forms). This is because these &quot;fidäl&quot; originally represented distinct sounds, but phonological changes merged them. The citation form for each series is the consonant+&quot;ä&quot; form, i.e. the first column of the &quot;fidäl&quot;. The Amharic script is included in Unicode, and glyphs are included in fonts available with major operating systems.

===Alphasyllabary===
===Gemination===
As in most other Ethiopian Semitic languages, gemination is contrastive in Amharic. That is, consonant length can distinguish words from one another; for example, &#x27;he said&#x27;, &#x27;there is&#x27;; &#x27;he hits&#x27;, &#x27;he will be hit&#x27;. Gemination is not indicated in Amharic orthography, but Amharic readers typically do not find this to be a problem. This property of the writing system is analogous to the vowels of Arabic and Hebrew or the tones of many Bantu languages, which are not normally indicated in writing. Ethiopian novelist Haddis Alemayehu, who was an advocate of Amharic orthography reform, indicated gemination in his novel &quot;Love to the Grave&quot; by placing a dot above the characters whose consonants were geminated, but this practice is rare.

=== Punctuation ===
Punctuation includes the following:

: section mark
: word separator
: full stop (period)
: comma
: semicolon
: colon
: preface colon (introduces speech from a descriptive prefix)
: question mark
: paragraph separator

==Grammar==

;Simple Amharic sentences

One may construct simple Amharic sentences by using a subject and a predicate. Here are a few simple sentences:



===Pronouns===

==== Personal pronouns ====
Amharic grammar distinguishes person, number, and often gender. This includes personal pronouns such as English &quot;I&quot;, Amharic &#x27;; English &quot;she&quot;, Amharic &#x27;. As in other Semitic languages, the same distinctions appear in three other places in their grammar.

; Subject–verb agreement
All Amharic verbs agree with their subjects; that is, the person, number, and (in the second- and third-person singular) gender of the subject of the verb are marked by suffixes or prefixes on the verb. Because the affixes that signal subject agreement vary greatly with the particular verb tense/aspect/mood, they are normally not considered to be pronouns and are discussed elsewhere in this article under verb conjugation.
; Object pronoun suffixes
Amharic verbs often have additional morphology that indicates the person, number, and (second- and third-person singular) gender of the object of the verb.
While morphemes such as &quot;-at&quot; in this example are sometimes described as signaling object agreement, analogous to subject agreement, they are more often thought of as object pronoun suffixes because, unlike the markers of subject agreement, they do not vary significantly with the tense/aspect/mood of the verb. For arguments of the verb other than the subject or the object, there are two separate sets of related suffixes, one with a benefactive meaning (&quot;to&quot;, &quot;for&quot;), the other with an adversative or locative meaning (&quot;against&quot;, &quot;to the detriment of&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;at&quot;).


Morphemes such as &quot;-llat&quot; and &quot;-bbat&quot; in these examples will be referred to in this article as prepositional object pronoun suffixes because they correspond to prepositional phrases such as &quot;for her&quot; and &quot;on her&quot;, to distinguish them from the direct object pronoun suffixes such as &quot;-at&quot; &#x27;her&#x27;.
;Possessive suffixes
Amharic has a further set of morphemes that are suffixed to nouns, signaling possession: &quot;bet&quot; &#x27;house&#x27;, &quot;bete&quot;, &quot;my house&quot;, ; &quot;betwa&quot;, &quot;her house&quot;.

In each of these four aspects of the grammar, independent pronouns, subject–verb agreement, object pronoun suffixes, and possessive suffixes, Amharic distinguishes eight combinations of person, number, and gender. For first person, there is a two-way distinction between singular (&quot;I&quot;) and plural (&quot;we&quot;), whereas for second and third persons, there is a distinction between singular and plural and within the singular a further distinction between masculine and feminine (&quot;you m. sg.&quot;, &quot;you f. sg.&quot;, &quot;you pl.&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;they&quot;).

Amharic is a pro-drop language: neutral sentences in which no element is emphasized normally omit independent pronouns: &#x27; &#x27;he&#x27;s Ethiopian&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;I invited her&#x27;. The Amharic words that translate &quot;he&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, and &quot;her&quot; do not appear in these sentences as independent words. However, in such cases, the person, number, and (second- or third-person singular) gender of the subject and object are marked on the verb. When the subject or object in such sentences is emphasized, an independent pronoun is used: &#x27; &#x27;he&#x27;s Ethiopian&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;I invited her&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;I invited her&quot;&quot;.

The table below shows alternatives for many of the forms. The choice depends on what precedes the form in question, usually whether this is a vowel or a consonant, for example, for the first-person singular possessive suffix, &#x27; &#x27;my country&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;my body&#x27;.

Within second- and third-person singular, there are two additional polite independent pronouns, for reference to people to whom the speaker wishes to show respect. This usage is an example of the so-called T–V distinction that is made in many languages. The polite pronouns in Amharic are &quot;ǝrswo&quot; &#x27;you (sg. polite)&#x27;. and &quot;ǝssaččäw&quot; &#x27;s/he (polite)&#x27;. Although these forms are singular semantically—they refer to one person—they correspond to third-person plural elsewhere in the grammar, as is common in other T–V systems. For the possessive pronouns, however, the polite 2nd person has the special suffix &quot;-wo&quot; &#x27;your sg. pol.&#x27;

For possessive pronouns (&quot;mine&quot;, &quot;yours&quot;, etc.), Amharic adds the independent pronouns to the preposition &#x27; &#x27;of&#x27;: &#x27; &#x27;mine&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;yours m. sg.&#x27;, &#x27;yours f. sg.&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;hers&#x27;, etc.

====Reflexive pronouns====
For reflexive pronouns (&#x27;myself&#x27;, &#x27;yourself&#x27;, etc.), Amharic adds the possessive suffixes to the noun &quot;ras&quot; &#x27;head&#x27;: &quot;rase&quot; &#x27;myself&#x27;, &quot;raswa&quot; &#x27;herself&#x27;, etc.

====Demonstrative pronouns====
Like English, Amharic makes a two-way distinction between near (&#x27;this, these&#x27;) and far (&#x27;that, those&#x27;) demonstrative expressions (pronouns, adjectives, adverbs). Besides number, Amharic – unlike English – also distinguishes between the masculine and the feminine genders in the singular.

There are also separate demonstratives for formal reference, comparable to the formal personal pronouns: &quot;ǝññih&quot; &#x27;this, these (formal)&#x27; and &quot;ǝnniya&quot; &#x27;that, those (formal)&#x27;.

The singular pronouns have combining forms beginning with &quot;zz&quot; instead of &quot;y&quot; when they follow a preposition: &quot;sǝläzzih&quot; &#x27;because of this; therefore&#x27;, &quot;ǝndäzziya&quot; &#x27;like that&#x27;. The plural demonstratives, like the second and third person plural personal pronouns, are formed by adding the plural prefix &quot;ǝnnä-&quot; to the singular masculine forms.

===Nouns===
Amharic nouns can be primary or derived. A noun like &#x27; &#x27;foot, leg&#x27; is primary, and a noun like &#x27; &#x27;pedestrian&#x27; is a derived noun.

====Gender====
Amharic nouns can have a masculine or feminine gender. There are several ways to express gender. An example is the old suffix &quot;-t&quot; for femininity. This suffix is no longer productive and is limited to certain patterns and some isolated nouns. Nouns and adjectives ending in &quot;-awi&quot; usually take the suffix &quot;-t&quot; to form the feminine form, e.g. &quot;ityop̣p̣ya-(a)wi&quot; &#x27;Ethiopian (m.)&#x27; vs. &quot;ityop̣p̣ya-wi-t&quot; &#x27;Ethiopian (f.)&#x27;; &quot;sämay-awi&quot; &#x27;heavenly (m.)&#x27; vs. &quot;sämay-awi-t&quot; &#x27;heavenly (f.)&#x27;. This suffix also occurs in nouns and adjective based on the pattern &#x27;, e.g. &#x27; &#x27;king&#x27; vs. &#x27; &#x27;queen&#x27; and &#x27; &#x27;holy (m.)&#x27; vs. &quot;&quot; &#x27;holy (f.)&#x27;.

Some nouns and adjectives take a feminine marker &quot;-it&quot;: &#x27; &#x27;child, boy&#x27; vs. &#x27; &#x27;girl&#x27;; &quot;bäg&quot; &#x27;sheep, ram&#x27; vs. &quot;bäg-it&quot; &#x27;ewe&#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;senior, elder (m.)&#x27; vs. &#x27; &#x27;old woman&#x27;; &quot;ṭoṭa&quot; &#x27;monkey&#x27; vs. &quot;ṭoṭ-it&quot; &#x27;monkey (f.)&#x27;. Some nouns have this feminine marker without having a masculine opposite, e.g. &quot;&quot; &#x27;spider&#x27;, &quot;azur-it&quot; &#x27;whirlpool, eddy&#x27;. There are, however, also nouns having this &quot;-it&quot; suffix that are treated as masculine: &quot;säraw-it&quot; &#x27;army&#x27;, &quot;nägar-it&quot; &#x27;big drum&#x27;.

The feminine gender is not only used to indicate biological gender, but may also be used to express smallness, e.g. &quot;bet-it-u&quot; &#x27;the little house&#x27; (lit. house--). The feminine marker can also serve to express tenderness or sympathy.

====Specifiers====
Amharic has special words that can be used to indicate the gender of people and animals. For people, &quot;wänd&quot; is used for masculinity and &quot;set&quot; for femininity, e.g. &quot;wänd lǝǧ&quot; &#x27;boy&#x27;, &quot;set lǝǧ&quot; &#x27;girl&#x27;; &quot;wänd hakim&quot; &#x27;physician, doctor (m.)&#x27;, &quot;set hakim&quot; &#x27;physician, doctor (f.)&#x27;.

For animals, the words &quot;täbat&quot;, &quot;awra&quot;, or &quot;wänd&quot; (less usual) can be used to indicate masculine gender, and &quot;&quot; or &quot;set&quot; to indicate feminine gender. Examples: &quot;täbat ṭǝǧǧa&quot; &#x27;calf (m.)&#x27;; &quot;awra doro&quot; &#x27;cock (rooster)&#x27;; &quot;set doro&quot; &#x27;hen&#x27;.

====Plural====
The plural suffix &#x27; is used to express plurality of nouns. Some morphophonological alternations occur depending on the final consonant or vowel. For nouns ending in a consonant, plain &#x27; is used: &quot;bet&quot; &#x27;house&#x27; becomes &#x27; &#x27;houses&#x27;. For nouns ending in a back vowel (-a, -o, -u), the suffix takes the form &#x27;, e.g. &#x27; &#x27;dog&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;dogs&#x27;; &quot;käbäro&quot; &#x27;drum&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;drums&#x27;. Nouns that end in a front vowel pluralize using &#x27; or &#x27;, e.g. &#x27; &#x27;scholar&#x27;, &#x27; or &#x27; &#x27;scholars&#x27;. Another possibility for nouns ending in a vowel is to delete the vowel and use plain &#x27;, as in &#x27; &#x27;dogs&#x27;.

Besides using the normal external plural (&quot;-očč&quot;), nouns and adjectives can be pluralized by way of reduplicating one of the &quot;radicals&quot;. For example, &quot;wäyzäro&quot; &#x27;lady&#x27; can take the normal plural, yielding &#x27;, but &#x27; &#x27;ladies&#x27; is also found (Leslau 1995:173).

Some kinship-terms have two plural forms with a slightly different meaning. For example, &#x27; &#x27;brother&#x27; can be pluralized as &#x27; &#x27;brothers&#x27; but also as &#x27; &#x27;brothers of each other&#x27;. Likewise, &#x27; &#x27;sister&#x27; can be pluralized as &#x27; (&#x27;sisters&#x27;), but also as &#x27; &#x27;sisters of each other&#x27;.

In compound words, the plural marker is suffixed to the second noun: &#x27; &#x27;church&#x27; (lit. house of Christian) becomes &#x27; &#x27;churches&#x27;.

====Archaic forms====
Amsalu Aklilu has pointed out that Amharic has inherited a large number of old plural forms directly from Classical Ethiopic (Geʽez) (Amharic: &quot;gǝ&#x27;ǝz)&quot; (Leslau 1995:172). There are basically two archaic pluralising strategies, called external and internal plural. The external plural consists of adding the suffix &quot;-an&quot; (usually masculine) or &quot;-at&quot; (usually feminine) to the singular form. The internal plural employs vowel quality or apophony to pluralize words, similar to English &quot;man&quot; vs. &quot;men&quot; and &quot;goose&quot; vs. &quot;geese&quot;. Sometimes combinations of the two systems are found. The archaic plural forms are sometimes used to form new plurals, but this is only considered grammatical in more established cases.
* Examples of the external plural: &#x27; &#x27;teacher&#x27;, &#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;wise person&#x27;, &#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;priest&#x27;, &#x27;; &quot;qal&quot; &#x27;word&#x27;, &quot;&quot;.
* Examples of the internal plural: &#x27; &#x27;virgin&#x27;, &#x27;; &quot;hagär&quot; &#x27;land&#x27;, &quot;&quot;.
* Examples of combined systems: &#x27; &#x27;king&#x27;, &#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;star&#x27;, &#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;book&#x27;, &#x27;.

====Definiteness====
If a noun is definite or &quot;specified&quot;, this is expressed by a suffix, the &quot;article&quot;, which is -&quot;u&quot; or -&quot;w&quot; for masculine singular nouns and -&quot;wa&quot;, -&quot;itwa&quot; or -&quot;ätwa&quot; for feminine singular nouns. For example:
In singular forms, this article distinguishes between the male and female gender; in plural forms this distinction is absent, and all definites are marked with -&quot;u&quot;, e.g. &quot;bet-očč-u&quot; &#x27;houses&#x27;, &quot;gäräd-očč-u&quot; &#x27;maids&#x27;. As in the plural, morphophonological alternations occur depending on the final consonant or vowel.
====Accusative====
Amharic has an accusative marker, -&quot;(ə)n&quot;. Its use is related to the definiteness of the object, thus Amharic shows differential object marking. In general, if the object is definite, possessed, or a proper noun, the accusative must be used, but if the direct object is not determined, the accusative marker is generally not used. (Leslau 1995: pp. 181–182 ff.).

The accusative suffix is usually placed after the first word of the noun phrase:

====Nominalization====
Amharic has various ways to derive nouns from other words or other nouns. One way of nominalizing consists of a form of &quot;vowel agreement&quot; (similar vowels on similar places) inside the three-radical structures typical of Semitic languages. For example:
* CəCäC: – &#x27; &#x27;wisdom&#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;sickness&#x27;
* CəCCaC-e: – &#x27; &#x27;obesity&#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;cruelty&#x27;
* CəCC-ät: – &#x27; &#x27;moistness&#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;knowledge&#x27;; &quot;&quot; &#x27;fatness&#x27;.
There are also several nominalising suffixes.
* &#x27;: – &#x27;relation&#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;Christianity&#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;laziness&#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;priesthood&#x27;.
* &quot;-e&quot;, suffixed to place name X, yields &#x27;a person from X&#x27;: &quot;goǧǧam-e&quot; &#x27;someone from Gojjam&#x27;.
* &#x27; and &#x27; serve to express profession, or some relationship with the base noun: &#x27; &#x27;pedestrian&#x27; (from &#x27; &#x27;foot&#x27;); &quot;&quot; &#x27;gate-keeper&#x27; (from &quot;bärr&quot; &#x27;gate&#x27;).
* &#x27; and &#x27; – &#x27;-ness&#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;Ethiopianness&#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;nearness&#x27; (from &quot; &#x27;near&#x27;).

===Verbs===

====Conjugation====

As in other Semitic languages, Amharic verbs use a combination of prefixes and suffixes to indicate the subject, distinguishing three persons, two numbers, and (in the second and third persons singular) two genders.

====Gerund====
Along with the infinitive and the present participle, the gerund is one of three non-finite verb forms. The infinitive is a nominalized verb, the present participle expresses incomplete action, and the gerund expresses completed action, e.g. &quot; bälto &quot;wädä gäbäya hedä&quot; &#x27;Ali, having eaten lunch, went to the market&#x27;. There are several usages of the gerund depending on its morpho-syntactic features.

=====Verbal use=====
The gerund functions as the head of a subordinate clause (see the example above). There may be more than one gerund in one sentence. The gerund is used to form the following tense forms:
* present perfect &quot; &#x27;He has said&#x27;.
* past perfect &quot; &#x27;He had said&#x27;.
* possible perfect &quot; &#x27;He (probably) has said&#x27;.

=====Adverbial use=====
The gerund can be used as an adverb:
alfo alfo &quot; &#x27;Sometimes he laughs&#x27;. (From ማለፍ &#x27;to pass&#x27;)

===Adjectives===
Adjectives are words or constructions used to qualify nouns. Adjectives in Amharic can be formed in several ways: they can be based on nominal patterns, or derived from nouns, verbs and other parts of speech. Adjectives can be nominalized by way of suffixing the nominal article (see Nouns above). Amharic has few primary adjectives. Some examples are &#x27; &#x27;kind, generous&#x27;, &#x27; &#x27;mute, dumb, silent&#x27;, &quot; &#x27;yellow&#x27;.

====Nominal patterns====
:CäCCaC – &#x27; &#x27;heavy&#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;generous&#x27;
:CäC(C)iC – &#x27; &#x27;fine, subtle&#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;new&#x27;
:CäC(C)aCa – &#x27; &#x27;broken&#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;bent, wrinkled&#x27;
:CəC(C)əC – &#x27; &#x27;intelligent, smart&#x27;; &quot; &#x27;hidden&#x27;
:CəC(C)uC – &#x27; &#x27;worthy, dignified&#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;black&#x27;; &quot; &#x27;holy&#x27;

====Denominalizing suffixes====
:-äñña – &#x27; &#x27;powerful&#x27; (from &quot;hayl&quot; &#x27;power&#x27;); &#x27; &#x27;true&#x27; (from &quot; &#x27;truth&#x27;)
:-täñña – &quot; &#x27;secular&#x27; (from &quot;aläm&quot; &#x27;world&#x27;)
:-awi – &#x27; &#x27;intelligent&#x27; (from &#x27; &#x27;heart&#x27;); &#x27; &#x27;earthly&#x27; (from &#x27; &#x27;earth&#x27;); &quot;haymanot-awi&quot; &#x27;religious&#x27; (from &quot;haymanot&quot; &#x27;religion&#x27;)

====Prefix &quot;yä&quot;====
:&quot;yä-kätäma&quot; &#x27;urban&#x27; (lit. &#x27;from the city&#x27;); &#x27; &#x27;Christian&#x27; (lit. &#x27;of Christianity&#x27;); &#x27; &#x27;wrong&#x27; (lit. &#x27;of falsehood&#x27;).

====Adjective noun complex====
The adjective and the noun together are called the &#x27;adjective noun complex&#x27;. In Amharic, the adjective precedes the noun, with the verb last; e.g. &#x27; &#x27;a bad master&#x27;; &#x27; (lit. big house he-built) &#x27;he built a big house&#x27;.

If the adjective noun complex is definite, the definite article is suffixed to the adjective and not to the noun, e.g. &#x27; (lit. big- house) &#x27;the big house&#x27;. In a possessive construction, the adjective takes the definite article, and the noun takes the pronominal possessive suffix, e.g. &#x27; (lit. big- house-my) &quot;my big house&quot;.

When enumerating adjectives using &#x27; &#x27;and&#x27;, both adjectives take the definite article: &#x27; (lit. pretty--and intelligent- girl came) &quot;the pretty and intelligent girl came&quot;. In the case of an indefinite plural adjective noun complex, the noun is plural and the adjective may be used in singular or in plural form. Thus, &#x27;diligent students&#x27; can be rendered &#x27; (lit. diligent student-) or &#x27; (lit. diligent- student-).

==Dialects==
Not much has been published about Amharic dialect differences. All dialects are mutually intelligible, but certain minor variations are noted.

=== Jewish Amharic ===
The Beta Israel who today live mostly in Israel speak a dialect of Amharic called Jewish Amharic (Hebrew: אמהרית מעוברת). It replaced many Christian phrases with Jewish ones. One example is the replacing the phrase &quot;It is good that Mary had pardoned you&quot; with &quot;It is good that god has relieved you peacefully&quot;, these phrases are used to congratulate a mother on successful childbirth. Another example is calling a type of Grasshopper &quot;Moses&#x27;s horses&quot; instead of &quot;Mary&#x27;s horses&quot;. This variety also contains influence from Modern Hebrew due to the large Beta Israel presence in Israel. Currently Jewish Amharic is declining as the Beta Israel gradually abandon Amharic in favor of Hebrew.

==Literature==


Haddis Alemayehu (1910–2003), foreign minister and novelist, including author of &quot;Love to the Grave&quot;, considered the greatest novel in Ethiopian literature.The oldest surviving examples of written Amharic date back to the reigns of the 14th century Emperor of Ethiopia Amda Seyon I and his successors, who commissioned a number of poems known as &quot;የወታደሮች መዝሙር&quot; (Soldier songs) glorifying them and their troops. There is a growing body of literature in Amharic in many genres. This literature includes government proclamations and records, educational books, religious material, novels, poetry, proverb collections, dictionaries (monolingual and bilingual), technical manuals, medical topics, etc. The Bible was first translated into Amharic by Abu Rumi in the early 19th century, but other translations of the Bible into Amharic have been done since. The most famous Amharic novel is &quot;Fiqir Iske Meqabir&quot; (transliterated various ways) by Haddis Alemayehu (1909–2003), translated into English by Sisay Ayenew with the title &quot;Love unto Crypt&quot;, published in 2005 (). Others include Baalu Girma, Tsegaye Gabre-Medhin, Kebede Michael.

==Rastafari movement==
The word &quot;Rastafari&quot; comes from &quot;Ras Täfäri&quot;, the pre-regnal title of Haile Selassie, composed of the Amharic words &quot;Ras&quot; (literally &quot;Head&quot;, an Ethiopian title equivalent to duke) and Haile Selassie&#x27;s pre-regnal name, Tafari.

Many Rastafarians learn Amharic as a second language, as they consider it to be sacred. After Haile Selassie&#x27;s 1966 visit to Jamaica, study circles in Amharic were organized in Jamaica as part of the ongoing exploration of Pan-African identity and culture. Various reggae artists in the 1970s, including Ras Michael, Lincoln Thompson and Misty in Roots, have sung in Amharic, thus bringing the language to a wider audience. The Abyssinians, a reggae group, have also used Amharic, most notably in the song &quot;Satta Massagana&quot;. The title was believed to mean &quot;give thanks&quot;; however, this phrase means &quot;he thanked&quot; or &quot;he praised&quot;, as &#x27; means &quot;he gave&quot;, and &#x27; &quot;thanks&quot; or &quot;praise&quot;. The correct way to say &quot;give thanks&quot; in Amharic is one word, &quot;misgana&quot;. The word &quot;satta&quot; has become a common expression in the Rastafari dialect of English, Iyaric, meaning &quot;to sit down and partake&quot;.

==Software==
Amharic is supported on most major Linux distributions, including Fedora and Ubuntu. Amharic script is included in Unicode, in the Ethiopic block (U+1200 – U+137F). Nyala font is included on Windows 7 (see YouTube video) and Vista (Amharic Language Interface Pack) to display and edit using the Amharic Script. In February 2010, Microsoft released its Windows Vista operating system in Amharic, enabling Amharic speakers to use its operating system in their language.

Google added Amharic to its Language Tools which allows typing Amharic Script online without an Amharic Keyboard. Since 2004 Wikipedia has had an Amharic language Wiki that uses Ethiopic script.

<text>Hubert &quot;Cubby&quot; Selby Jr. (July 23, 1928 – April 26, 2004) was an American writer. Two of his novels, &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot; (1964) and &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; (1978), explore worlds in the New York area and were adapted as films, both of which he appeared in.

His first novel was prosecuted for obscenity in the United Kingdom and banned in Italy, prompting defences from many leading authors such as Anthony Burgess. He influenced multiple generations of writers. For more than 20 years, he taught creative writing at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, where he lived full-time after 1983.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Hubert Selby was born in 1928 in Brooklyn, New York City, to Adalin and Hubert Selby Sr., a merchant seaman and former coal miner from Kentucky. Selby and his wife Adalin had settled in Bay Ridge. Hubert attended public schools, including the competitive Stuyvesant High School.

Selby Jr. dropped out of school at the age of 15 to work in the city docks before becoming a merchant seaman in 1947.

Having been diagnosed with tuberculosis, he was taken off the ship in Bremen, Germany, and sent back to the United States. For the next three and a half years, Selby was in and out of the U.S. Public Health Hospital (part of a system of hospitals originally established to care for merchant seamen) in New York for treatment.

Selby went through an experimental drug treatment, streptomycin, that later caused some severe complications. During an operation, surgeons removed several of Selby&#x27;s ribs to reach his lungs. One of his lungs collapsed, and doctors removed part of the other.

===Becoming a writer===

For the next ten years, Selby was mostly bedridden; he was frequently hospitalized with a variety of lung-related ailments. The doctors offered a bleak prognosis, suggesting he was unlikely to survive long because he &quot;just didn&#x27;t have enough lung capacity&quot;. Gilbert Sorrentino, a childhood friend who had become a writer, encouraged Selby to write fiction. Unable to have regular work because of his health, Selby decided, &quot;I know the alphabet. Maybe I could be a writer.&quot;

He later wrote:
I was sitting at home and had a profound experience. I experienced, in all of my Being, that someday I was going to die, and it wouldn&#x27;t be like it had been happening, almost dying but somehow staying alive, but I would just die! And two things would happen right before I died: I would regret my entire life; I would want to live it over again. This terrified me. The thought that I would live my entire life, look at it and realize I blew it forced me to do something with my life.

With no formal training, Selby used a raw language to portray the bleak and violent world that was part of his youth. He said, &quot;I write, in part, by ear. I hear, as well as feel and see, what I am writing. I have always been enamoured with the music of the speech in New York.&quot;

Little concerned with proper grammar, punctuation, or diction, Selby used unorthodox techniques in most of his works. He indented his paragraphs with alternating lengths, often by simply dropping down one line when finished with a paragraph. Like Jack Kerouac in his &quot;spontaneous prose&quot;, Selby often completed his writing in a fast, stream-of-consciousness style. He replaced apostrophes with forward slashes, which were closer on the typewriter, to avoid interrupting his flow of writing.

===Early works===
Selby started working on his first short story, &quot;The Queen Is Dead,&quot; in 1958. At the time, he had a succession of day jobs, but he wrote every night. During the day, he worked as a secretary, a gas station attendant, and a freelance copywriter. The short story developed slowly for the next six years before he published it.

In 1961, his short story &quot;Tralala&quot; was published in the literary journal &quot;The Provincetown Review&quot;. It also appeared in &quot;Black Mountain Review&quot; and &quot;New Directions&quot;. It portrays the seedy life (ridden with violence, theft and mediocre con-artistry) and the gang rape of a prostitute. The journal editor was arrested for selling pornographic literature to a minor. The journal was used as evidence in an obscenity trial, but the case was later dismissed on appeal.

On 24 October 1964, Selby married Judith Lumino, but the marriage soon fell apart. As he continued to write, his longtime friend LeRoi Jones (later Amiri Baraka), the poet and playwright, encouraged him to contact Sterling Lord, then Kerouac&#x27;s agent. Selby combined &quot;Tralala&quot;, &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; and four other loosely linked short stories as part of his first novel, &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot; (1964). The novel was accepted and published by Grove Press, which had already published works by William S. Burroughs. In November 1964, New York Times literary critic Eliot Fremont-Smith described the novel as &quot;a brutal book,&quot; concluding that it &quot;is not a book one &#x27;recommends&#x27;--except perhaps to writers. From them, those who wish to read it, it deserves attention.&quot;

The novel was praised by many, including the poet Allen Ginsberg, who predicted that it would &quot;explode like a rusty hellish bombshell over America and still be eagerly read in a hundred years.&quot; In 1967, the novel was prosecuted for obscenity in the United Kingdom. The British writer Anthony Burgess was among a number of writers who appeared as witnesses in its defense. The jury&#x27;s conviction was later reversed on appeal. The novel was banned in Italy.

Although he wrote all his work while sober, Selby continued to battle drug addiction. In 1967 he was arrested for heroin possession and served two months in the Los Angeles County jail. After his release, he moved from New York to Los Angeles to try to escape his addictions and finally kicked the habit. He stayed clean of illicit drugs but continued to battle alcohol abuse for the next two years. Also that year, Selby met his future wife, Suzanne Victoria Shaw, at a bar in West Hollywood. The couple moved in together two days after they met. They married in 1969, after Selby and his second wife, Judith, had finalized their divorce. For the next decade, Suzanne and Selby traveled back and forth between their home in Southern California and the East Coast, settling permanently in the Los Angeles area in 1983. They had two children, daughter Rachel and son William.

===Life after &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot;===
In 1971, Selby published his second novel, &quot;The Room,&quot; which received positive reviews. It featured a criminally insane man, locked in a room in a prison, who reminisces about his disturbing past. Selby described &quot;The Room&quot; as &quot;the most disturbing book ever written.&quot;

Selby continued to write short fiction, as well as screenplays and teleplays at his apartment in West Hollywood. His work was published in many magazines, including &quot;Black Mountain Review&quot;, &quot;Evergreen Review&quot;, &quot;Provincetown Review&quot;, &quot;Kulchur&quot;, &quot;New Directions Annual&quot;, &quot;Yugen&quot;, &quot;Swank&quot; and &quot;Open City&quot;.

In the 1980s, Selby met punk rock singer Henry Rollins, who had long admired the writer&#x27;s works and publicly championed them. Rollins helped broaden Selby&#x27;s readership, and also arranged recording sessions and reading tours for Selby. Rollins issued original recordings through his own 2.13.61 publications, and distributed Selby&#x27;s other works.

For the last 20 years of his life, Selby also taught creative writing as an adjunct professor in the Master of Professional Writing program at the University of Southern California.

A film adaptation of &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot;, directed by Uli Edel, was made in 1989. Selby appeared in &quot;Brooklyn&quot; in a brief cameo as a taxi driver. &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; (1978) was adapted as a film of the same name released in 2000. He had a small role as a prison guard taunting Marlon Wayans, suffering through forced labor while withdrawing.

==Death and legacy==
Selby spent the last month of his life in and out of the hospital and died at his home in Highland Park, Los Angeles, on April 26, 2004, of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Although he was in pain, he refused morphine on his deathbed.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; published his obituary the day after his death.
In 1999, a French movie director Ludovic Cantais made a documentary about Hubert Selby Jr, &quot;Hubert Selby Jr, a couple of things&quot; broadcast on many European channels. 
Selby was the subject of the 2005 documentary, &quot;Hubert Selby Jr: It/ll Be Better Tomorrow&quot;

==In popular culture==
* In 1972, David Bowie said that two novels influenced him greatly: Jack Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot; and Selby&#x27;s &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot;. According to an article in the &quot;New York Times&quot; published in 1973, Bowie had &quot;confessed that he had formed a desperate identification with&quot; the latter novel.
* Selby&#x27;s first work, &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; (appearing as a chapter in &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot;), inspired the name of an album by Manchester alternative rock group The Smiths. 
* In the book &quot;Was This Man a Genius?&quot; by Julie Hecht, the comedian Andy Kaufman is quoted saying that his favourite book is &quot;The Demon&quot; by Hubert Selby (p. 159). 
* &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot; inspired the name of Sting&#x27;s first band, Last Exit.
* The Manic Street Preachers song, &quot;Of Walking Abortion&quot;, from the album &quot;The Holy Bible&quot;, begins with a quote from Selby: &quot;I knew that someday I was gonna die. And I knew that before I died, two things would happen to me, that number one: I would regret my entire life; and number two: I would want to live my life over again.&quot;
*British band Alt-J composed a song entitled &quot;Fitzpleasure&quot;, inspired by the short story &quot;Tralala&quot; from &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot;.
* In the Nicolas Winding Refn film &quot;Bleeder&quot;, a character enters a book store asking for a Hubert Selby Jr. work.
* Nicolas Winding Refn dedicated his film &quot;Pusher II&quot; to Selby, Jr.
* The block of East 10th Street between Second and Third Avenues in Manhattan (where Selby lived in 1964 with his second wife, Judith, and her son, James) is mentioned in Chapter 23 of Tom Robbins&#x27;s 1976 novel, &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot;, being described specifically as the place where &quot;Hubert Selby, Jr., wrote &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot;.&quot;

<text>Frances Ann &quot;Fran&quot; Ulmer (born February 1, 1947) is an American administrator and Democratic politician from the U.S. state of Alaska. She served as the seventh lieutenant governor of Alaska from 1994 to 2002 under Governor Tony Knowles, becoming the first woman elected to statewide office in Alaska, and lost the 2002 gubernatorial election against Republican Frank Murkowski. In 2007 she became the Chancellor of the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA), before serving as Chair of the United States Arctic Research Commission between 2011 and 2020, appointed by President Barack Obama.

==Early life==
Frances Ann &quot;Fran&quot; Ulmer was born in Madison, Wisconsin, and grew up in Horicon, Wisconsin. Her parents owned a furniture store and a funeral home in the area. Her education included a bachelor&#x27;s degree with a double major in economics and political science from the University of Wisconsin–Madison and a Juris Doctor &quot;cum laude&quot; from the University of Wisconsin Law School. In 2018, Fran was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Alaska Anchorage. In 1977, she married attorney Bill Council. They had two children. They were married until his death in 2013.

==Alaska politics==

Ulmer first began working in Alaska in 1973 as a lawyer at the Legislative Affairs Agency in Juneau, Alaska. Ulmer worked as a legislative assistant for Jay Hammond, the Republican governor of Alaska from 1975 through 1977. He appointed her Director of Policy Development and Planning that year, a role she held until 1981. She served on Juneau&#x27;s Planning and Zoning Commission from 1981 to 1983.

She served as mayor of Juneau from 1983 to 1985 and was in the Alaska House of Representatives from 1987 to 1994 as a Democrat, where she sponsored and won approval of legislation concerning criminal justice, education, public administration, health, and transportation. From 1993 to 1994 she served as the house minority leader.

In 1994 she won the open primary for the nomination for lieutenant governor. She was elected to two four-year terms on the Democratic ticket, along with Governor Tony Knowles. In that post, she became a nationally recognized leader in election reform and making government more efficient and accessible through telecommunications. During her tenure, Alaska became the first state to replace the punched card system with a statewide optical scanning ballot counting system.

===Alaska gubernatorial election, 2002===

In 2002, she won the nomination of the Democratic party for the office of governor. She lost the election to the Republican candidate, U.S. Senator Frank Murkowski.

==Post electoral career==
In 2003, Fran was a fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics in Cambridge, MA. In 2004, she accepted a teaching job at the University of Alaska, Anchorage. She served as the Director of the Institute of Economic and Social Research (ISER) at UAA. In March 2007, University of Alaska system President Mark R. Hamilton appointed Ulmer interim chancellor for the University of Alaska Anchorage. In April 2008, she accepted the position of chancellor on a permanent basis. As chancellor, she was responsible for governing UAA and its eight satellite facilities in Southcentral Alaska. On January 22, 2010, she announced her intent to resign from the Chancellor&#x27;s position at UAA, effective 2011.

At the national level, Ulmer served as a member of the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission for ten years, on the Federal Communications Commission’s State and Local Advisory Committee, the Federal Election Commission&#x27;s State Advisory Committee, and as co-chair of the Aspen Institute&#x27;s Arctic Climate Change Commission.

In June 2010, President Barack Obama appointed Ulmer to the seven-member National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. The commission was charged with investigating the causes of the explosion and oil spill and recommending changes to prevent future disasters. She served on the boards of The Nature Conservancy, First National Bank Alaska, the CIRI Foundation, Commonwealth North, the National Parks Conservation Association, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and she chaired the global board of The Nature Conservancy (2019-2022). She currently serves on the National Parks Conservation Association Board and the Alaska Trustees of The Nature Conservancy.

In 2011, President Barack Obama appointed Ulmer as chair of the US Arctic Research Commission. In July 2014, Ulmer was appointed a special advisor to John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State, on arctic issues. She endorsed the building of more icebreakers to allow the United States Coast Guard to better research the arctic. On July 28, 2020, President Trump appointed Jon Harrison to serve as the Chair of the Arctic Research Commission. On November 10, 2020, Randy &quot;Church&quot; Kee, a retired major general of the United States Air Force, was appointed to the position previously assigned to Ulmer.

In 2018 she was a Visiting Professor at Stanford University in the Department of Earth System Science in the School of Earth, Energy, and Environmental Sciences and in 2019, she joined Harvard’s Belfer Center Arctic Initiative as a Senior Fellow, serving until 2023.

In 2021 she was appointed as one of the additional campaign co-chairs for former Independent governor Bill Walker&#x27;s gubernatorial campaign.

<doc id="95144" wikidata="Q193605" url="?curid=95144" title="Lullaby">
<text>A lullaby (), or a cradle song, is a soothing song or piece of music that is usually played for (or sung to) children (for adults see music and sleep). The purposes of lullabies vary. In some societies, they are used to pass down cultural knowledge or tradition. In addition, lullabies are often used for the developing of communication skills, indication of emotional intent, maintenance of infants&#x27; undivided attention, modulation of infants&#x27; arousal, and regulation of behavior. Perhaps one of the most important uses of lullabies is as a sleep aid for infants. As a result, the music is often simple and repetitive. Lullabies can be found in many countries, and have existed since ancient times.

==Etymology==
The term &#x27;lullaby&#x27; derives from the Middle English &quot;lullen&quot; (&quot;to lull&quot;) and &quot;by&quot;[&quot;e&quot;] (in the sense of &quot;near&quot;); it was first recorded circa 1560.

A folk etymology derives &quot;lullaby&quot; from &quot;Lilith-Abi&quot; (Hebrew for &quot;Lilith, begone&quot;). In the Jewish tradition, Lilith was a demon who was believed to steal children&#x27;s souls in the night. To guard against Lilith, Jewish mothers would hang four amulets on nursery walls with the inscription &quot;Lilith – abei&quot; [&quot;Lilith – begone&quot;].

==Characteristics==
Lullabies tend to share exaggerated melodic tendencies, including simple pitch contours, large pitch ranges, and generally higher pitch. These clarify and convey heightened emotions, usually of love or affection. When there is harmony, infants almost always prefer consonant intervals over dissonant intervals. Furthermore, if there is a sequence of dissonant intervals in a song, an infant will usually lose interest and it becomes very difficult to regain its attention. To reflect this, most lullabies contain primarily consonant intervals. Tonally, most lullabies are simple, often merely alternating tonic and dominant harmonies.

In addition to pitch tendencies, lullabies share several structural similarities. The most frequent tendencies are intermittent repetitions and long pauses between sections. This dilutes the rate of material and appeals to infants&#x27; slower capacity for processing music.

Rhythmically, there are shared patterns. Lullabies are usually in triple meter or 6/8 time, giving them a &quot;characteristic swinging or rocking motion.&quot; This mimics the movement a baby experiences in the womb as a mother moves. In addition, infants&#x27; preference for rhythm shares a strong connection with what they hear when they are bounced, and even their own body movements. The tempos of lullabies tend to be generally slow, and the utterances are short. Again, this aids in the infant&#x27;s processing of the song.

Lullabies almost never have instrumental accompaniments. Infants have shown a strong preference for unaccompanied lullabies over accompanied lullabies. Again, this appeals to infants&#x27; more limited ability to process information.

Lullabies are often used for their soothing nature, even for non-infants. One study found lullabies to be the most successful type of music or sound for relieving stress and improving the overall psychological health of pregnant women.

These characteristics tend to be consistent across cultures. It was found that adults of various cultural backgrounds could recognize and identify lullabies without knowing the cultural context of the song. Infants have shown a strong preferences for songs with these qualities.

==Cross-cultural prevalence==
Lullabies are often used to pass down or strengthen the cultural roles and practices. In an observation of the setting of lullabies in Albanian culture, lullabies tended to be paired with the rocking of the child in a cradle. This is reflected in the swinging rhythmicity of the music. In addition to serving as a cultural symbol of the infant&#x27;s familial status, the cradle&#x27;s presence during the singing of lullabies helps the infant associate lullabies with falling asleep and waking up. Kogan and Gintsburg, in a study of the mainly preliterate, non-media-exposed people on the island of Socotra, found that lullabies in this culture shared many of the features of lullabies in the western and oriental tradition: the repetition of &#x27;nonsense syllables&#x27;, the creation of a warm affective space, and the allusions to ancient customs and beliefs. On the other hand, these lullabies lacked the &#x27;counting elements&#x27; found in other traditions, and defined safety as a spiritual space, while danger was conceptualised as both physical and spiritual.

==Therapeutic value==
Studies conducted by Dr. Jeffery Perlman, chief of newborn medicine at NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital&#x27;s Komansky Center for Children&#x27;s Health, find that gentle music therapy not only slows down the heart rate of prematurely delivered infants but also helps them feed and sleep better. This helps them gain weight and speeds their recovery. A study published in May 2013 in the &quot;Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics&quot; under the of the Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City found that the type of music matters. Therapeutically designed &quot;live&quot; music – and lullabies sung in person – can influence cardiac and respiratory function. Another study published in February 2011 in &quot;Arts in Psychotherapy&quot; by Jayne M. Standley of the National Institute for Infant and Child Medical Music Therapy at Florida State University suggests that babies who receive this kind of therapy leave the hospital sooner.

Additional research by Jayne M. Standley has demonstrated that the physiological responses of prematurely delivered infants undergoing intensive care can be regulated by listening to gentle lullabies through headphones. In addition to slowing heart and respiration rates, lullabies have been associated with increased oxygen saturation levels and the possible prevention of potentially life-threatening episodes of apnea and bradycardia. Gentle music can also provide stimulation for premature infants to behave in ways that boost their development and keep them alive. Lullabies can serve as a low-risk source of stimulation and reinforcement for increasing nipple sucking (feeding) rates, providing infants with the nutrition they require for growth and development. Lullabies are thus associated with encouraging the rapid development of the neurological system and with a shorter length of hospitalization.

More recent research has shown that lullabies sung live can have beneficial effects on physiological functioning and development in premature infants. The live element of a slow, repetitive entrained rhythm can regulate sucking behavior. Infants have a natural tendency to entrain to the sounds that surround them. Beat perception begins during fetal development in the womb and infants are born with an innate musical preference. The element of live breathing sounds can regulate infant heart rate, quiet-alert states, and sleep. Live lullabies can also enhance parent-child bonding, thus decreasing parental stress associated with the intensive care. In short, live lullabies sung by music therapists induce relaxation, rest, comfort, and optimal growth and development. &quot;Hush, Little Baby&quot; has been observed cross-culturally and is known to have a natural capacity for soothing and energizing infants, as well as nurturing caregiving bonds.

Many lullabies, regardless of the meaning of their words, possess a peaceful hypnotic quality. Others are mournful or dark, like a lament. The Gaelic lullaby &quot;Ba, Ba, Mo Leanabh Beag&quot; was written in 1848 during the potato famine, which caused much hardship in the Scottish Highlands. The song mentions soft potatoes, the mother&#x27;s situation, and her fears for her child. In the 1920s, poet Federico García Lorca studied Spanish lullabies and noted the &quot;poetic character&quot; and &quot;depth of sadness&quot; of many of them. Lorca&#x27;s theory was that a large part of the function of the lullaby is to help a mother vocalize her worries and concerns. In short, they also serve as therapy for the mother.

Combined with lament, lullaby can have &quot;restorative resounding&quot; properties for hospice inpatients and their families. Lullabies typically soothe people through the awake/sleep transition, and similarly can soothe people through the life/death transition. Music therapists have called these tunes &quot;lullaments&quot;, that which sustain the spirit, support psychological structure, and enable resilience during times of vulnerability to the effects of adversity. Lullaments are music-contextualized expressions of attachment and detachment, sadness/tears and happiness/laughter, privilege and loss, nurturance and grief, deterioration, stasis and moving forward.

Many Christmas carols are designed as lullabies for the infant Jesus, the most famous of them being &quot;Silent Night&quot;.

==Mother–infant interaction==
Infants exhibit a natural preference for infant-directed over non-infant-directed lullabies and their own mothers&#x27; voice over that of another female.

Much research has been generated on the role of lullabies in nurturing caregiving bonds between mother and child. Mothers who sing lullabies to their infants engage in a bonding activity that actually alters the underlying neural structure of the infant brain such that the infant becomes &quot;tuned&quot; into music and its association with parental affiliation. In one Taiwanese study of Kangaroo Care, a technique practiced on newborn infants in which a mother holds her child tightly against her chest, it was demonstrated that infant–mother dyads who listened to their choice of lullaby were associated with more quiet sleep states and less occurrence of crying by the infant and were also associated with significantly lower maternal anxiety, than those dyads who did not listen to lullabies. The therapeutic effect of lullabies can thus have a strong impact on calming anxieties and nurturing bonds, which is especially important with premature and fragile infants.

==In classical music==
Lullabies written by established classical composers are often given the form-name &quot;berceuse&quot;, which is French for lullaby, or cradle song. The most famous lullaby is the one by Johannes Brahms (&quot;Wiegenlied&quot;, 1868). While there has been no confirmation, there are many strong arguments that Brahms suffered from a sleep disorder known as sleep apnea. It is speculated (based on lullabies&#x27; utility as a sleep aid) that this was part of his inspiration for composing &quot;Wiegenlied.&quot;

Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Berceuse&quot; is a composition for solo piano. Other famous examples of the genre include Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Berceuse sur le nom de Gabriel Fauré&quot; for violin and piano; the &quot;Berceuse élégiaque&quot; by Ferruccio Busoni; the &quot;Berceuse&quot; from the opera &quot;Jocelyn&quot; by Benjamin Godard; the &quot;Berceuse&quot; by Igor Stravinsky which is featured in the &quot;Firebird&quot; ballet, and &quot;Lullaby for String Quartet&quot; by George Gershwin. The English composer Nicholas Maw&#x27;s orchestral nocturne, &quot;The World in the Evening&quot;, is subtitled &quot;lullaby for large orchestra&quot;. German composer&#x27;s Paul Graener last movement of his suite &quot;From The Realm of Pan&quot; is entitled &quot;Pan sings the world a lullaby&quot;.

==By geography==

===Asia===
====India====
In Hindi and in many Indian languages, the lullaby is called &quot;Lori&quot;. Mostly, lullabies are sung in folk languages. Lullabies have been also an integral part of Indian cinema. Many lullabies were written and composed in the fifties, such as:

In the Malayalam language, there is a rich collection of traditional lullabies, known as &quot;tharaattu Pattu&quot;. One of the most famous is &quot;Omanathinkal Kidavo&quot;, written and composed by poet lyricist Iravi Varman Thampi who is widely known as Irayimman Thampi. This lullaby was written for the queen of Travancore to sing to her son young prince Swathi Thirunal, who later became the king and a famous musician (composed many Keerthanas in a Raga Dheerasankarabharanam commonly known as Sankarabharanam).

===Europe===
====Czech====
&quot;Spi, Janíčku, spi&quot; (&quot;Sleep, Johny, sleep&quot;) – This playful lullaby was collected in Moravia by František Sušil (1804–1868), a priest and an activist of Czech national revival. He collected songs in Moravia and Silesia as well as in Slavic villages in Austria. This lullaby uses a specific name of the child, Janíček, a familiar form of the very common male name Jan. Nonsense is employed here, as the boy is promised not only a green and a red apple but also a blue one if he falls asleep.

&quot;Ukolébavka&quot; (&quot;Lullaby&quot;) – This lullaby was published in 1633 in The Informatorium of the School of Infancy by Johann Amos Comenius (1592–1670). The book is likely to be the first treatise on the development and educating infants and children up to six in the family. Comenius stressed among other things the necessity of sensory and emotional stimuli at an early age. Thus, he included for mothers and nurses the Czech text and the score of the originally German lullaby by 16th century preacher Mathesius.

&quot;Hajej, můj andílku&quot; (&quot;Sleep, My Little Angel&quot;) – This is one of the most melodious Czech lullabies, first collected by Karel Jaromír Erben (1811–1870), Czech romantic writer, poet and collector of Czech folk songs and fairy tales. The text refers specifically to the mother rocking her baby.

&quot;Halí, dítě&quot; (&quot;Hullee, baby&quot;) – This lullaby was collected by František Bartoš (1837–1906), pedagogue and ethnographer who collected Moravian songs. The second line says the carer will leave after the child falls asleep, but in the third line we learn that only to the garden in the valley to pick raspberries.

&quot;Halaj, belaj, malučký&quot; (&quot;Sleep, Sleep, Little One&quot;) – This lullaby is from the east of Moravia, where the dialect is influenced by the Slovak language, and also folk songs are similar to the Slovak ones from across the border. A boy is promised the essential food for infants, kašička, a smooth mixture made of milk and flour.

====Danish====
&quot;Elefantens vuggevise&quot; (&quot;The Elephant&#x27;s Lullaby&quot;) – This lullaby is considered one of the most popular lullabies in Denmark. Using exotic animals as theme, the lyrics are simple and easily understood by a child. It was made politically correct in the 1990s: The word &quot;negerdreng&quot; (Negro boy) was changed to kokosnød (coconut). The song was written in 1948 by the Danish writer and poet Harald H. Lund with music composed by writer-musician Mogens Jermiin Nissen (1906–72).

&quot;Godnatsang&quot; (&quot;Goodnight Song&quot;) – This is a popular lullaby that was composed (lyrics and music) by Sigurd Barrett (born 1967), pianist, composer and host of a children&#x27;s TV programme in Denmark, and fellow musician Steen Nikolaj Hansen. Sigurd usually sings this song at the end of his children&#x27;s show. This lullaby has sleeping time as theme: The day is over and we must sleep and rest so we will be fresh again in the morning.

&quot;Mues sang få Hansemand&quot; (&quot;Mother&#x27;s Song to Little Hans&quot;) – This lullaby originated from south Jutland and is very old (year of composition is unknown). It is not well known in Denmark. This may, in part, be due to the fact that it was written in Jutlandic dialect. The lyrics were written by Marie Thulesen (1878–1924) with music by the Danish musician Oluf Ring (1884–1946).

&quot;Jeg vil tælle stjernerne&quot; (&quot;I Will Count the Stars&quot;) – This lullaby was written in 1951 by the Danish poet and writer Halfdan Rasmussen (1915–2002). Rasmussen had written numerous rhymes and jingles, some of which are still being used in Danish beginner classes in public schools (e.g. the picture book &quot;Halfdans ABC&quot;). This lullaby&#x27;s music was composed by Hans Dalgaard (1919–81). The song is a simple story of a child who tries to count the stars with his/her fingers and toes.

====Dutch====
&quot;Slaap kindje slaap&quot; – The text is mostly chosen for its rhyme. Sleep, little child, sleep. Outside a sheep is walking. A sheep with white feet, it drinks its milk so sweet.

&quot;Maantje tuurt, maantje gluurt&quot; – Older Dutch lullaby. Look the moon peeps and spies through the window. Have the children already gone to bed? Yes moon, they&#x27;re lying in bed. Good, tomorrow will be a new day of playing and learning.

====English====
Many medieval English verses associated with the birth of Jesus take the form of a lullaby, including &quot;Lullay, my liking, my dere son, my sweting&quot; and may be versions of contemporary lullabies. However, most of those used today date from the seventeenth century onwards. Some of the best known English-language lullabies originate from the US, notably &quot;Bye, baby Bunting&quot; and &quot;Hush, Little Baby&quot;.

====German====
&quot;Der Mond ist aufgegangen&quot; (&quot;The moon has risen&quot;), &quot;Es kam ein Herr zum Schlößli&quot; (&quot;A knight came to the castle&quot;), &quot;Guten Abend, gute Nacht&quot; (&quot;Good evening, good night&quot;), &quot;Weißt du, wie viel Sternlein stehen&quot; (&quot;Do you know how many stars there are?&quot;) and &quot;Schlaf, Kindlein, schlaf&quot; (&quot;Sleep, dear child, sleep&quot;) became widely known in the 18th and 19th century and still are.

====Hungarian====
The Hungarian words for &quot;lullaby&quot; are , , and . Another, now archaic and little-used word is . In Hungary, lullabies did not develop into an independent genre, and most folk lullabies are from before the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin (). Relatively little foreign impact can be seen in them, but many changes came from their use in schools. A discernable subtype are , Christmas lullabies sung in the name of Mary, mother of Jesus. Most cradle-songs use that are meaningless, archaic, or come from baby talk, as well as many terms of endearment such as , some of which they share with love songs. They usually have only one verse and short lines.

====Russian====
&quot;Cossack Lullaby&quot; is a cradle song which Russian writer and poet Mikhail Lermontov transcribed from a Terek Cossack woman&#x27;s singing in Ossetia in the 19th century.

====Scottish====
There are many lullabies in Scottish song tradition, with well-known examples in Scottish Gaelic, Scots and English. They include songs which express emotions other than affection for the child – notably &quot;Griogal Cridhe&quot;, which commemorates the beheading of Gregor Roy MacGregor by his father-in-law, Campbell of Glenlyon and brother-in-law in 1570 and &quot;Hishie Ba&quot; which may refer to a gang assault. A number of traditional lullabies also express social issues and this has been continued in modern lullaby writing in Scotland, notably Jim MacLean&#x27;s &quot;Smile in Your Sleep&quot; (also known as &quot;Hush, Hush, Time to Be Sleeping&quot;), Matt McGinn&#x27;s &quot;Miner&#x27;s Lullaby&quot; (also known as &quot;Coorie Doon&quot;) and Karine Polwart&#x27;s &quot;Baleerie Baloo&quot;. Christina Stewart&#x27;s kist o dreams project provides a resource of over 30 Scottish lullabies, ranging from Doric Scots of the North East, to Northern Isles dialect of Shetland, Scottish Gaelic and English language examples.

====Ukrainian====
&quot;Oi Khodyt Son Kolo Vikon&quot; (The Dream Passes by the Window) is from Ukraine.

====Welsh====
The oldest known Welsh-language lullaby is &quot;Dinogad&#x27;s Smock&quot; (; ). Although the lullaby is preserved in the 13th century Book of Aneirin, its unusual linguistics suggest the original lullaby may have been composed in Common Brittonic a language spoken across the island of Britain until the 6th century AD. The lullaby also gives an insight into the Gododdin a Celtic culture of northern England and southern Scotland, as well as linguistic evidence for features of the extinct Cumbric language. It has also been used to provide evidence of the fauna of central Britain during this period and the late survival of the Eurasian Lynx in Britain.

Another traditional Welsh lullaby &quot;Suo Gân&quot; gained popularity in the late twentieth century. Although the earliest prints date from around 1800, new arrangements of the lullaby have been performed and recorded by artists from around the world as well as featuring in Hollywood films (&quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;), anime (&quot;Black Butler&quot;) and computer games (&quot;The Maid of Sker&quot;). Suo Gân&#x27;s distinctive tune has also been repurposed for several Christian hymns.

===Oceania===

<doc id="95154" wikidata="Q80585" url="?curid=95154" title="Associative array">
<text>In computer science, an associative array, map, symbol table, or dictionary is an abstract data type that stores a collection of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection. In mathematical terms, an associative array is a function with &quot;finite&quot; domain. It supports &#x27;lookup&#x27;, &#x27;remove&#x27;, and &#x27;insert&#x27; operations. 

The dictionary problem is the classic problem of designing efficient data structures that implement associative arrays.
The two major solutions to the dictionary problem are hash tables and search trees.
It is sometimes also possible to solve the problem using directly addressed arrays, binary search trees, or other more specialized structures.

Many programming languages include associative arrays as primitive data types, while many other languages provide software libraries that support associative arrays. Content-addressable memory is a form of direct hardware-level support for associative arrays.

Associative arrays have many applications including such fundamental programming patterns as memoization and the decorator pattern.

The name does not come from the associative property known in mathematics. Rather, it arises from the association of values with keys. It is not to be confused with associative processors.

==Operations==
In an associative array, the association between a key and a value is often known as a &quot;mapping&quot;; the same word may also be used to refer to the process of creating a new association.

The operations that are usually defined for an associative array are:

;Insert or put
: add a new formula_1 pair to the collection, mapping the key to its new value. Any existing mapping is overwritten. The arguments to this operation are the key and the value.
;Remove or delete
: remove a formula_1 pair from the collection, unmapping a given key from its value. The argument to this operation is the key.
;Lookup, find, or get
: find the value (if any) that is bound to a given key. The argument to this operation is the key, and the value is returned from the operation. If no value is found, some lookup functions raise an exception, while others return a default value (such as zero, null, or a specific value passed to the constructor).

Associative arrays may also include other operations such as determining the number of mappings or constructing an iterator to loop over all the mappings. For such operations, the order in which the mappings are returned is usually implementation-defined.

A multimap generalizes an associative array by allowing multiple values to be associated with a single key. A bidirectional map is a related abstract data type in which the mappings operate in both directions: each value must be associated with a unique key, and a second lookup operation takes a value as an argument and looks up the key associated with that value.

===Properties===

The operations of the associative array should satisfy various properties:
* codice_1
* codice_2, where codice_3 is an exception or default value
* codice_4
* codice_5
where codice_6 and codice_7 are keys, codice_8 is a value, codice_9 is an associative array, and codice_10 creates a new, empty associative array.

===Example===
Suppose that the set of loans made by a library is represented in a data structure. Each book in a library may be checked out by one patron at a time. However, a single patron may be able to check out multiple books. Therefore, the information about which books are checked out to which patrons may be represented by an associative array, in which the books are the keys and the patrons are the values. Using notation from Python or JSON, the data structure would be:
 &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;: &quot;Alice&quot;,
 &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;: &quot;Alice&quot;,
 &quot;Great Expectations&quot;: &quot;John&quot;

A lookup operation on the key &quot;Great Expectations&quot; would return &quot;John&quot;. If John returns his book, that would cause a deletion operation, and if Pat checks out a book, that would cause an insertion operation, leading to a different state:
 &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;: &quot;Alice&quot;,
 &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;: &quot;Pat&quot;,
 &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;: &quot;Alice&quot;

==Implementation==

For dictionaries with very few mappings, it may make sense to implement the dictionary using an association list, which is a linked list of mappings. With this implementation, the time to perform the basic dictionary operations is linear in the total number of mappings. However, it is easy to implement and the constant factors in its running time are small.

Another very simple implementation technique, usable when the keys are restricted to a narrow range, is direct addressing into an array: the value for a given key &quot;k&quot; is stored at the array cell &quot;A&quot;[&quot;k&quot;], or if there is no mapping for &quot;k&quot; then the cell stores a special sentinel value that indicates the lack of a mapping. This technique is simple and fast, with each dictionary operation taking constant time. However, the space requirement for this structure is the size of the entire keyspace, making it impractical unless the keyspace is small.

The two major approaches for implementing dictionaries are a hash table or a search tree.

=== Hash table implementations ===
The most frequently used general-purpose implementation of an associative array is with a hash table: an array combined with a hash function that separates each key into a separate &quot;bucket&quot; of the array. The basic idea behind a hash table is that accessing an element of an array via its index is a simple, constant-time operation. Therefore, the average overhead of an operation for a hash table is only the computation of the key&#x27;s hash, combined with accessing the corresponding bucket within the array. As such, hash tables usually perform in O(1) time, and usually outperform alternative implementations.

Hash tables must be able to handle collisions: the mapping by the hash function of two different keys to the same bucket of the array. The two most widespread approaches to this problem are separate chaining and open addressing. In separate chaining, the array does not store the value itself but stores a pointer to another container, usually an association list, that stores all the values matching the hash. By contrast, in open addressing, if a hash collision is found, the table seeks an empty spot in an array to store the value in a deterministic manner, usually by looking at the next immediate position in the array.

Open addressing has a lower cache miss ratio than separate chaining when the table is mostly empty. However, as the table becomes filled with more elements, open addressing&#x27;s performance degrades exponentially. Additionally, separate chaining uses less memory in most cases, unless the entries are very small (less than four times the size of a pointer).

=== Tree implementations ===
==== Self-balancing binary search trees ====
Another common approach is to implement an associative array with a self-balancing binary search tree, such as an AVL tree or a red–black tree.

Compared to hash tables, these structures have both strengths and weaknesses. The worst-case performance of self-balancing binary search trees is significantly better than that of a hash table, with a time complexity in big O notation of O(log &quot;n&quot;). This is in contrast to hash tables, whose worst-case performance involves all elements sharing a single bucket, resulting in O(&quot;n&quot;) time complexity. In addition, and like all binary search trees, self-balancing binary search trees keep their elements in order. Thus, traversing its elements follows a least-to-greatest pattern, whereas traversing a hash table can result in elements being in seemingly random order. Because they are in order, tree-based maps can also satisfy range queries (find all values between two bounds) whereas a hashmap can only find exact values. However, hash tables have a much better average-case time complexity than self-balancing binary search trees of O(1), and their worst-case performance is highly unlikely when a good hash function is used.

A self-balancing binary search tree can be used to implement the buckets for a hash table that uses separate chaining. This allows for average-case constant lookup, but assures a worst-case performance of O(log &quot;n&quot;). However, this introduces extra complexity into the implementation and may cause even worse performance for smaller hash tables, where the time spent inserting into and balancing the tree is greater than the time needed to perform a linear search on all elements of a linked list or similar data structure.

==== Other trees ====
Associative arrays may also be stored in unbalanced binary search trees or in data structures specialized to a particular type of keys such as radix trees, tries, Judy arrays, or van Emde Boas trees, though the relative performance of these implementations varies. For instance, Judy trees have been found to perform less efficiently than hash tables, while carefully selected hash tables generally perform more efficiently than adaptive radix trees, with potentially greater restrictions on the data types they can handle. The advantages of these alternative structures come from their ability to handle additional associative array operations, such as finding the mapping whose key is the closest to a queried key when the query is absent in the set of mappings.

=== Comparison ===
== Ordered dictionary ==
The basic definition of a dictionary does not mandate an order. To guarantee a fixed order of enumeration, ordered versions of the associative array are often used. There are two senses of an ordered dictionary:

* The order of enumeration is always deterministic for a given set of keys by sorting. This is the case for tree-based implementations, one representative being the container of C++.
* The order of enumeration is key-independent and is instead based on the order of insertion. This is the case for the &quot;ordered dictionary&quot; in .NET Framework, the LinkedHashMap of Java and Python.

The latter is more common. Such ordered dictionaries can be implemented using an association list, by overlaying a doubly linked list on top of a normal dictionary, or by moving the actual data out of the sparse (unordered) array and into a dense insertion-ordered one.

==Language support==
Associative arrays can be implemented in any programming language as a package and many language systems provide them as part of their standard library. In some languages, they are not only built into the standard system, but have special syntax, often using array-like subscripting.

Built-in syntactic support for associative arrays was introduced in 1969 by SNOBOL4, under the name &quot;table&quot;. TMG offered tables with string keys and integer values. MUMPS made multi-dimensional associative arrays, optionally persistent, its key data structure. SETL supported them as one possible implementation of sets and maps. Most modern scripting languages, starting with AWK and including Rexx, Perl, PHP, Tcl, JavaScript, Maple, Python, Ruby, Wolfram Language, Go, and Lua, support associative arrays as a primary container type. In many more languages, they are available as library functions without special syntax.

In Smalltalk, Objective-C, .NET, Python, REALbasic, Swift, VBA and Delphi they are called &quot;dictionaries&quot;; in Perl, Ruby and Seed7 they are called &quot;hashes&quot;; in C++, C#, Java, Go, Clojure, Scala, OCaml, Haskell they are called &quot;maps&quot; (see map (C++), unordered_map (C++), and ); in Common Lisp and Windows PowerShell, they are called &quot;hash tables&quot; (since both typically use this implementation); in Maple and Lua, they are called &quot;tables&quot;. In PHP and R, all arrays can be associative, except that the keys are limited to integers and strings. In JavaScript (see also JSON), all objects behave as associative arrays with string-valued keys, while the Map and WeakMap types take arbitrary objects as keys. In Lua, they are used as the primitive building block for all data structures. In Visual FoxPro, they are called &quot;Collections&quot;. The D language also supports associative arrays.

==Permanent storage==
Many programs using associative arrays will need to store that data in a more permanent form, such as a computer file. A common solution to this problem is a generalized concept known as &quot;archiving&quot; or &quot;serialization&quot;, which produces a text or binary representation of the original objects that can be written directly to a file. This is most commonly implemented in the underlying object model, like .Net or Cocoa, which includes standard functions that convert the internal data into text. The program can create a complete text representation of any group of objects by calling these methods, which are almost always already implemented in the base associative array class.

For programs that use very large data sets, this sort of individual file storage is not appropriate, and a database management system (DB) is required. Some DB systems natively store associative arrays by serializing the data and then storing that serialized data and the key. Individual arrays can then be loaded or saved from the database using the key to refer to them. These key–value stores have been used for many years and have a history as long as that of the more common relational database (RDBs), but a lack of standardization, among other reasons, limited their use to certain niche roles. RDBs were used for these roles in most cases, although saving objects to a RDB can be complicated, a problem known as object-relational impedance mismatch.

After approximately 2010, the need for high-performance databases suitable for cloud computing and more closely matching the internal structure of the programs using them led to a renaissance in the key–value store market. These systems can store and retrieve associative arrays in a native fashion, which can greatly improve performance in common web-related workflows.

<text>Symbolism was a late 19th-century art movement of French and Belgian origin in poetry and other arts seeking to represent absolute truths symbolically through language and metaphorical images, mainly as a reaction against naturalism and realism.

In literature, the style originates with the 1857 publication of Charles Baudelaire&#x27;s &quot;Les Fleurs du mal&quot;. The works of Edgar Allan Poe, which Baudelaire admired greatly and translated into French, were a significant influence and the source of many stock tropes and images. The aesthetic was developed by Stéphane Mallarmé and Paul Verlaine during the 1860s and 1870s. In the 1880s, the aesthetic was articulated by a series of manifestos and attracted a generation of writers. The term &quot;symbolist&quot; was first applied by the critic Jean Moréas, who invented the term to distinguish the Symbolists from the related Decadents of literature and art.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;symbolism&quot; is derived from the word &quot;symbol&quot; which derives from the Latin &quot;symbolum&quot;, a symbol of faith, and &quot;symbolus&quot;, a sign of recognition, in turn from classical Greek σύμβολον &quot;symbolon&quot;, an object cut in half constituting a sign of recognition when the carriers were able to reassemble the two halves. In ancient Greece, the &quot;symbolon&quot; was a shard of pottery which was inscribed and then broken into two pieces which were given to the ambassadors from two allied city states as a record of the alliance.

==Precursors and origins==
Symbolism was largely a reaction against naturalism and realism, anti-idealistic styles which were attempts to represent reality in its gritty particularity, and to elevate the humble and the ordinary over the ideal. Symbolism was a reaction in favour of spirituality, imagination, and dreams. Some writers, such as Joris-Karl Huysmans, began as naturalists before becoming symbolists; for Huysmans, this change represented his increasing interest in religion and spirituality. Certain of the characteristic subjects of the Decadents represent naturalist interest in sexuality and taboo topics, but in their case this was mixed with Byronic romanticism and the world-weariness characteristic of the &quot;fin de siècle&quot; period.

The Symbolist poets have a more complex relationship with Parnassianism, a French literary style that immediately preceded it. While being influenced by hermeticism, allowing freer versification, and rejecting Parnassian clarity and objectivity, it retained Parnassianism&#x27;s love of word play and concern for the musical qualities of verse. The Symbolists continued to admire Théophile Gautier&#x27;s motto of &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake&quot;, and retained – and modified – Parnassianism&#x27;s mood of ironic detachment. Many Symbolist poets, including Stéphane Mallarmé and Paul Verlaine, published early works in &quot;Le Parnasse contemporain&quot;, the poetry anthologies that gave Parnassianism its name. But Arthur Rimbaud publicly mocked prominent Parnassians and published scatological parodies of some of their main authors, including François Coppée – misattributed to Coppée himself – in &quot;L&#x27;Album zutique&quot;.

One of Symbolism&#x27;s most colourful promoters in Paris was art and literary critic (and occultist) Joséphin Péladan, who established the Salon de la Rose + Croix. The Salon hosted a series of six presentations of avant-garde art, writing and music during the 1890s, to give a presentation space for artists embracing spiritualism, mysticism, and idealism in their work. A number of Symbolists were associated with the Salon.

==Movement==
===The Symbolist Manifesto===
Jean Moréas published the Symbolist Manifesto (&quot;Le Symbolisme&quot;) in &quot;Le Figaro&quot; on 18 September 1886 (see 1886 in poetry). The Symbolist Manifesto names Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé, and Paul Verlaine as the three leading poets of the movement. Moréas announced that symbolism was hostile to &quot;plain meanings, declamations, false sentimentality and matter-of-fact description&quot;, and that its goal instead was to &quot;clothe the Ideal in a perceptible form&quot; whose &quot;goal was not in itself, but whose sole purpose was to express the Ideal.&quot;
:&quot;Ainsi, dans cet art, les tableaux de la nature, les actions des humains, tous les phénomènes concrets ne sauraient se manifester eux-mêmes; ce sont là des apparences sensibles destinées à représenter leurs affinités ésotériques avec des Idées primordiales.&quot;

:(Thus, in this art movement, representations of nature, human activities and all real life events don&#x27;t stand on their own; they are rather veiled reflections of the senses pointing to archetypal meanings through their esoteric connections.)

In a nutshell, as Mallarmé writes in a letter to his friend Henri Cazalis, &#x27;to depict not the thing but the effect it produces&#x27;.

In 1891, Mallarmé defined Symbolism as follows, &quot;To name an object is to suppress three-quarters of the delight of the poem, which consists in the pleasure of guessing little by little; to &quot;suggest&quot; is, that is the dream. It is the perfect use of this mystery that constitutes the symbol: to evoke an object, gradually in order to reveal a state of the soul or, inversely, to choose an object and from it identify a state of the soul, by a series of deciphering operations... There must always be enigma in poetry.&quot;

While describing the pre-World War I friendship, which defied the pervasive anti-German sentiment and revanchism of the &quot;Belle Époque&quot;, between French symbolists Paul Verlaine and Stéphane Mallarmé and young and aspiring German symbolist poet Stefan George, Michael and Erika Metzger have written, &quot;For the Symbolists, the pursuit of &#x27;art for art&#x27;s sake&#x27;, was a highly serious – nearly a sacred – function, since beauty, in and of itself, stood for a higher meaning beyond itself. In their ultimate higher striving, the French Symbolists are not far from the Platonic ideals of the Good, the True, and the Beautiful, and this idealistic aspect was undoubtedly what appealed to George far more than the Estheticism, the Bohemianism, and the apparent Nihilism so often superficially associated with this group.&quot;

===Techniques===
The symbolist poets wished to liberate techniques of versification in order to allow greater room for &quot;fluidity&quot;, and as such were sympathetic with the trend toward free verse, as evident in the poems of Gustave Kahn and Ezra Pound. Symbolist poems were attempts to evoke, rather than primarily to describe; symbolic imagery was used to signify the state of the poet&#x27;s soul. T. S. Eliot was influenced by the poets Jules Laforgue, Paul Valéry and Arthur Rimbaud who used the techniques of the Symbolist school, though it has also been said that &#x27;Imagism&#x27; was the style to which both Pound and Eliot subscribed (see Pound&#x27;s &quot;Des Imagistes&quot;). Synesthesia was a prized experience; poets sought to identify and confound the separate senses of scent, sound, and colour. In Baudelaire&#x27;s poem &quot;Correspondences&quot; (which mentions &quot;forêts de symboles&quot; (&quot;forests of symbols&quot;) and is considered the touchstone of French Symbolism):

:&quot;Il est des parfums frais comme des chairs d&#x27;enfants,Doux comme les hautbois, verts comme les prairies,– Et d&#x27;autres, corrompus, riches et triomphants,Ayant l&#x27;expansion des choses infinies,Comme l&#x27;ambre, le musc, le benjoin et l&#x27;encens,Qui chantent les transports de l&#x27;esprit et des sens.&quot;

::(There are fragrances that are fresh like children&#x27;s skin, calm like oboes, green like meadows– And others, rotten, heady, and triumphant,having the expansiveness of infinite things, like amber, musk, benzoin, and incense,which sing of the raptures of the soul and senses.)

and Rimbaud&#x27;s poem &quot;Voyelles&quot;:

:&quot;A noir, E blanc, I rouge, U vert, O bleu : voyelles…&quot;
::(A black, E white, I red, U green, O blue: vowels…)

– both poets seek to identify one sense experience with another. The earlier Romanticism of poetry used symbols, but these symbols were unique and privileged objects. The symbolists were more extreme, investing all things, even vowels and perfumes, with potential symbolic value. &quot;The physical universe, then, is a kind of language that invites a privileged spectator to decipher it, although this does not yield a single message so much as a superior network of associations.&quot; Symbolist symbols are not allegories, intended to represent; they are instead intended to evoke particular states of mind. The nominal subject of Mallarmé&#x27;s &quot;Le cygne&quot; (&quot;The Swan&quot;) is of a swan trapped in a frozen lake. Significantly, in French, &quot;&quot; is a homophone of &quot;&quot;, a sign. The overall effect is of overwhelming whiteness; and the presentation of the narrative elements of the description is quite indirect:

:&quot;Le vierge, le vivace, et le bel aujourd&#x27;huiVa-t-il nous déchirer avec un coup d’aile ivreCe lac dur oublié que hante sous le givreLe transparent glacier des vols qui n’ont pas fui!Un cygne d’autrefois se souvient que c’est luiMagnifique mais qui sans espoir se délivre…&quot;
::(The virgin, lively, and beautiful today – Will it tear us up with a drunken wingbeatThis hard forgotten lake that lurks beneath the frost,The transparent glacier of flights not taken with a blow from a drunken wing?A swan of long ago remembers that it is heMagnificent but without hope, who breaks free…)

===Paul Verlaine and the &quot;poètes maudits&quot;===
Of the several attempts at defining the essence of symbolism, perhaps none was more influential than Paul Verlaine&#x27;s 1884 publication of a series of essays on Tristan Corbière, Arthur Rimbaud, Stéphane Mallarmé, Marceline Desbordes-Valmore, Gérard de Nerval, and &quot;Pauvre Lelian&quot; (&quot;Poor Lelian&quot;, an anagram of Paul Verlaine&#x27;s own name), each of whom Verlaine numbered among the &quot;poètes maudits&quot;, &quot;accursed poets.&quot;

Verlaine argued that in their individual and very different ways, each of these hitherto neglected poets found genius a curse; it isolated them from their contemporaries, and as a result these poets were not at all concerned to avoid hermeticism and idiosyncratic writing styles. They were also portrayed as at odds with society, having tragic lives, and often given to self-destructive tendencies. These traits were not hindrances but consequences of their literary gifts. Verlaine&#x27;s concept of the &quot;poète maudit&quot; in turn borrows from Baudelaire, who opened his collection &quot;Les fleurs du mal&quot; with the poem &quot;Bénédiction&quot;, which describes a poet whose internal serenity remains undisturbed by the contempt of the people surrounding him.

In this conception of genius and the role of the poet, Verlaine referred indirectly to the aesthetics of Arthur Schopenhauer, the philosopher of pessimism, who maintained that the purpose of art was to provide a temporary refuge from the world of strife of the will.

===Philosophy===
Schopenhauer&#x27;s aesthetics represented shared concerns with the symbolist programme; they both tended to consider Art as a contemplative refuge from the world of strife and will. As a result of this desire for an artistic refuge, the symbolists used characteristic themes of mysticism and otherworldliness, a keen sense of mortality, and a sense of the malign power of sexuality, which Albert Samain termed a &quot;fruit of death upon the tree of life.&quot; Mallarmé&#x27;s poem &quot;Les fenêtres&quot; expresses all of these themes clearly. A dying man in a hospital bed, seeking escape from the pain and dreariness of his physical surroundings, turns toward his window but then turns away in disgust from

:&quot;… l&#x27;homme à l&#x27;âme dureVautré dans le bonheur, où ses seuls appétitsMangent, et qui s&#x27;entête à chercher cette ordurePour l&#x27;offrir à la femme allaitant ses petits, …&quot;

::(… the hard-souled man,Wallowing in happiness, where only his appetitesFeed, and who insists on seeking out this filthTo offer to the wife suckling his children, …)

and in contrast, he &quot;turns his back on life&quot; (&quot;tourne l’épaule à la vie&quot;) and he exclaims:

:&quot;Je me mire et me vois ange! Et je meurs, et j&#x27;aime– Que la vitre soit l&#x27;art, soit la mysticité –A renaître, portant mon rêve en diadème,Au ciel antérieur où fleurit la Beauté!&quot;

::(I look at myself and I seem like an angel! and I die, and I love– Whether the mirror might be art, or mysticism –To be reborn, bearing my dream as a crown,Under that former sky where Beauty flourishes!)

===Symbolists and decadents===
The symbolist style has frequently been confused with the Decadent movement, the name derived from French literary critics in the 1880s, suggesting the writers were self indulgent and obsessed with taboo subjects. While a few writers embraced the term, most avoided it. Jean Moréas&#x27; manifesto was largely a response to this polemic. By the late 1880s, the terms &quot;symbolism&quot; and &quot;decadence&quot; were understood to be almost synonymous. Though the aesthetics of the styles can be considered similar in some ways, the two remain distinct. The symbolists were those artists who emphasized dreams and ideals; the Decadents cultivated &quot;&quot;, ornamented, or hermetic styles, and morbid subject matters. The subject of the decadence of the Roman Empire was a frequent source of literary images and appears in the works of many poets of the period, regardless of which name they chose for their style, as in Verlaine&#x27;s &quot;Langueur&quot;:

:&quot;Je suis l&#x27;Empire à la fin de la Décadence,Qui regarde passer les grands Barbares blancsEn composant des acrostiches indolentsD&#x27;un style d&#x27;or où la langueur du soleil danse.&quot;
::(I am the Empire at the endgame of decadence, watching the great pale barbarians passing by, all the while composing lazy acrostic poems in a gilded style where the languishing sun dances.)

===Periodical literature===
A number of important literary publications were founded by symbolists or became associated with the style. The first was &quot;La Vogue&quot; initiated in April 1886. In October of that same year, Jean Moréas, Gustave Kahn, and Paul Adam began the periodical &quot;Le Symboliste&quot;. One of the most important symbolist journals was &quot;Mercure de France&quot;, edited by Alfred Vallette, which succeeded &quot;La Pléiade&quot;; founded in 1890, this periodical endured until 1965. Pierre Louÿs initiated &quot;La conque&quot;, a periodical whose symbolist influences were alluded to by Jorge Luis Borges in his story &quot;Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote&quot;. Other symbolist literary magazines included &quot;La Revue blanche&quot;, &quot;La Revue wagnérienne&quot;, &quot;La Plume&quot; and &quot;La Wallonie&quot;.

Rémy de Gourmont and Félix Fénéon were literary critics associated with symbolism. The symbolist and decadent literary styles were satirized by a book of poetry, &quot;Les Déliquescences d&#x27;Adoré Floupette&quot;, published in 1885 by Henri Beauclair and Gabriel Vicaire.

==In other media==
===Visual arts===

Symbolism in literature is distinct from symbolism in art although the two were similar in many aspects. In painting, symbolism can be seen as a revival of some mystical tendencies in the Romantic tradition, and was close to the self-consciously morbid and private decadent movement.

There were several rather dissimilar groups of Symbolist painters and visual artists, which included Paul Gauguin, Gustave Moreau, Gustav Klimt, Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis, Jacek Malczewski, Odilon Redon, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Henri Fantin-Latour, Gaston Bussière, Edvard Munch, Fernand Khnopff, Félicien Rops, and Jan Toorop. Symbolism in painting was even more widespread geographically than symbolism in poetry, affecting Mikhail Vrubel, Nicholas Roerich, Victor Borisov-Musatov, Martiros Saryan, Mikhail Nesterov, Léon Bakst, Elena Gorokhova in Russia, as well as Frida Kahlo in Mexico, Elihu Vedder, Remedios Varo, Morris Graves and David Chetlahe Paladin in the United States. Auguste Rodin is sometimes considered a symbolist sculptor.

The symbolist painters used mythological and dream imagery. The symbols used by symbolism are not the familiar emblems of mainstream iconography but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, symbolism in painting influenced the contemporary Art Nouveau style and Les Nabis.

===Music===

Symbolism had some influence on music as well. Many symbolist writers and critics were early enthusiasts of the music of Richard Wagner, an avid reader of Schopenhauer.

The symbolist aesthetic affected the works of Claude Debussy. His choices of &quot;libretti&quot;, texts, and themes come almost exclusively from the symbolist canon. Compositions such as his settings of &quot;Cinq poèmes de Charles Baudelaire&quot;, various art songs on poems by Verlaine, the opera &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; with a libretto by Maurice Maeterlinck, and his unfinished sketches that illustrate two Poe stories, &quot;The Devil in the Belfry&quot; and &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;, all indicate that Debussy was profoundly influenced by symbolist themes and tastes. His best known work, the &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot;, was inspired by Mallarmé&#x27;s poem, &quot;L&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot;.

The symbolist aesthetic also influenced Alexander Scriabin&#x27;s compositions. Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Pierrot Lunaire&quot; takes its text from German translations of the symbolist poems by Albert Giraud, showing an association between German expressionism and symbolism. Richard Strauss&#x27;s 1905 opera &quot;Salomé&quot;, based on the play by Oscar Wilde, uses a subject frequently depicted by symbolist artists.

===Prose fiction===
Symbolism&#x27;s style of the and adapted less well to narrative fiction than it did to poetry. Joris-Karl Huysmans&#x27; 1884 novel &quot;À rebours&quot; (English title: &quot;Against Nature&quot; or &quot;Against the Grain&quot;) explored many themes that became associated with the symbolist aesthetic. This novel, in which very little happens, catalogues the psychology of Des Esseintes, an eccentric, reclusive antihero. Oscar Wilde was influenced by the novel as he wrote &quot;Salome&quot;, and Huysmans&#x27; book appears in &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;: the titular character becomes corrupted after reading the book.

Paul Adam was the most prolific and representative author of symbolist novels. &quot;Les Demoiselles Goubert&quot; (1886), co-written with Jean Moréas, is an important transitional work between naturalism and symbolism. Few symbolists used this form. One exception was Gustave Kahn, who published &quot;Le Roi fou&quot; in 1896. In 1892, Georges Rodenbach wrote the short novel &quot;Bruges-la-Morte&quot;, set in the Flemish town of Bruges, which Rodenbach described as a dying, medieval city of mourning and quiet contemplation: in a typically symbolist juxtaposition, the dead city contrasts with the diabolical re-awakening of sexual desire. The cynical, misanthropic, misogynistic fiction of Jules Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly is sometimes considered symbolist, as well. Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio wrote his first novels in the symbolist manner.

===Theatre===
The characteristic emphasis on an internal life of dreams and fantasies have made symbolist theatre difficult to reconcile with more recent trends. Auguste Villiers de l&#x27;Isle-Adam&#x27;s drama &quot;Axël&quot; (rev. ed. 1890) is a definitive symbolist play. In it, two Rosicrucian aristocrats become enamored of each other while trying to kill each other, only to agree to commit suicide mutually because nothing in life could equal their fantasies. From this play, Edmund Wilson adopted the title &quot;Axel&#x27;s Castle&quot; for his influential study of the symbolist literary aftermath.

Maurice Maeterlinck, also a symbolist playwright, wrote &quot;The Blind&quot; (1890), &quot;The Intruder&quot; (1890), &quot;Interior&quot; (1891), &quot;Pelléas and Mélisande&quot; (1892), and &quot;The Blue Bird&quot; (1908).
Eugénio de Castro is considered one of the introducers of Symbolism in the Iberian Peninsula. He wrote &quot;Belkiss&quot;, &quot;dramatic prose-poem&quot; as he called it, about the doomed passion of Belkiss, The Queen of Sheba, to Solomon, depicting in an avant-garde and violent style the psychological tension and recreating very accurately the tenth century BC Israel. He also wrote &quot;King Galaor&quot; and &quot;Polycrates&#x27; Ring&quot;, being one of the most prolific Symbolist theoriticians.

Lugné-Poe (1869–1940) was an actor, director, and theatre producer of the late nineteenth century. Lugné-Poe &quot;sought to create a unified nonrealistic theatre of poetry and dreams through atmospheric staging and stylized acting&quot;. Upon learning about symbolist theatre, he never wanted to practice any other form. After beginning as an actor in the Théâtre Libre and Théâtre d&#x27;Art, Lugné-Poe grasped on to the symbolist movement and founded the Théâtre de l&#x27;Œuvre where he was manager from 1892 until 1929. Some of his greatest successes include opening his own symbolist theatre, producing the first staging of Alfred Jarry&#x27;s &quot;Ubu Roi&quot; (1896), and introducing French theatregoers to playwrights such as Ibsen and Strindberg.

The later works of the Russian playwright Anton Chekhov have been identified by essayist Paul Schmidt as being much influenced by symbolist pessimism. Both Konstantin Stanislavski and Vsevolod Meyerhold experimented with symbolist modes of staging in their theatrical endeavors.

Drama by symbolist authors formed an important part of the repertoire of the &quot;Théâtre de l&#x27;Œuvre&quot; and the &quot;Théâtre d&#x27;Art&quot;.

==Effect==

Among English-speaking artists, the closest counterpart to symbolism was aestheticism. The Pre-Raphaelites were contemporaries of the earlier symbolists, and have much in common with them. Symbolism had a significant influence on modernism (Remy de Gourmont considered the Imagists were its descendants) and its traces can also be detected in the work of many modernist poets, including T. S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, Conrad Aiken, Hart Crane, and W. B. Yeats in the anglophone tradition and Rubén Darío in Hispanic literature. The early poems of Guillaume Apollinaire have strong affinities with symbolism. Early Portuguese Modernism was heavily influenced by Symbolist poets, especially Camilo Pessanha; Fernando Pessoa had many affinities to Symbolism, such as mysticism, musical versification, subjectivism and transcendentalism.

Edmund Wilson&#x27;s 1931 study &quot;Axel&#x27;s Castle&quot; focuses on the continuity with symbolism and several important writers of the early twentieth century, with a particular emphasis on Yeats, Eliot, Paul Valéry, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, and Gertrude Stein. Wilson concluded that the symbolists represented a dreaming retreat into
things that are dying–the whole belle-lettristic tradition of Renaissance culture perhaps, compelled to specialize more and more, more and more driven in on itself, as industrialism and democratic education have come to press it closer and closer.&quot;

After the beginning of the 20th century, symbolism had a major effect on Russian poetry even as it became less and less popular in France. Russian symbolism originally began as an emulation of the French original, but then, under the influence of Vyacheslav Ivanov, it radically diverged until it became something unrecognizable. Steeped in the doctrines of Eastern Orthodoxy and the Christian mystical philosophy of Vladimir Solovyov, it began the careers of several major poets such as Alexander Blok, Andrei Bely, Boris Pasternak, and Marina Tsvetaeva. Bely&#x27;s novel &quot;Petersburg&quot; (1912) is considered the greatest example of Russian symbolist prose.

Primary influences on the style of Russian Symbolism were the irrationalistic and mystical poetry and philosophy of Fyodor Tyutchev and Solovyov, the novels of Fyodor Dostoyevsky, the operas of Richard Wagner, the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche, French symbolist and decadent poets (such as Stéphane Mallarmé, Paul Verlaine and Charles Baudelaire), and the dramas of Henrik Ibsen.

The style was largely inaugurated by Nikolai Minsky&#x27;s article &quot;The Ancient Debate&quot; (1884) and Dmitry Merezhkovsky&#x27;s book &quot;On the Causes of the Decline and on the New Trends in Contemporary Russian Literature&quot; (1892). Both writers promoted extreme individualism and the act of creation. Merezhkovsky was known for his poetry as well as a series of novels on &quot;god-men&quot;, among whom he counted Christ, Joan of Arc, Dante, Leonardo da Vinci, Napoleon, and (later) Hitler. His wife, Zinaida Gippius, also a major poet of early symbolism, opened a salon in St Petersburg, which came to be known as the &quot;headquarters of Russian decadence&quot;. Andrei Bely&#x27;s Petersburg (novel) a portrait of the social strata of the Russian capital, is frequently cited as a late example of Symbolism in 20th century Russian literature.

In Romania, symbolists directly influenced by French poetry first gained influence during the 1880s, when Alexandru Macedonski reunited a group of young poets associated with his magazine &quot;Literatorul&quot;. Polemicizing with the established &quot;Junimea&quot; and overshadowed by the influence of Mihai Eminescu, Romanian symbolism was recovered as an inspiration during and after the 1910s, when it was exampled by the works of Tudor Arghezi, Ion Minulescu, George Bacovia, Mateiu Caragiale, Tristan Tzara and Tudor Vianu, and praised by the modernist magazine &quot;Sburătorul&quot;.

The symbolist painters were an important influence on expressionism and surrealism in painting, two movements which descend directly from symbolism proper. The harlequins, paupers, and clowns of Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Blue Period&quot; show the influence of symbolism, and especially of Puvis de Chavannes. In Belgium, symbolism became so popular that it came to be known as a national style, particularly in landscape painting: the static strangeness of painters like René Magritte can be considered as a direct continuation of symbolism. The work of some symbolist visual artists, such as Jan Toorop, directly affected the curvilinear forms of art nouveau.

Many early motion pictures also employ symbolist visual imagery and themes in their staging, set designs, and imagery. The films of German expressionism owe a great deal to symbolist imagery. The virginal &quot;good girls&quot; seen in the cinema of D. W. Griffith, and the silent film &quot;bad girls&quot; portrayed by Theda Bara, both show the continuing influence of symbolism, as do the Babylonian scenes from Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Intolerance&quot;. Symbolist imagery lived on longest in horror film: as late as 1932, Carl Theodor Dreyer&#x27;s &quot;Vampyr&quot; showed the obvious influence of symbolist imagery; parts of the film resemble &quot;tableau vivant&quot; re-creations of the early paintings of Edvard Munch.

<text>Spiny lobsters, also known as langustas, langouste, or rock lobsters, are a family (Palinuridae) of about 60 species of achelate crustaceans, in the Decapoda Reptantia. Spiny lobsters are also, especially in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa, and the Bahamas, called crayfish, sea crayfish, or crawfish (&quot;kreef&quot; in South Africa), terms which elsewhere are reserved for freshwater crayfish.

==Classification==
The furry lobsters (such as &quot;Palinurellus&quot;) were previously separated into a family of their own, the Synaxidae, but they are usually considered members of the Palinuridae. The slipper lobsters (Scyllaridae) are their next-closest relatives, and these two or three families make up the Achelata. Genera of spiny lobsters include &quot;Palinurus&quot; and a number of anagrams thereof: &quot;Panulirus&quot;, &quot;Linuparus&quot;, etc. The name derives from the small Italian port of Palinuro, which was known for harvesting the European spiny lobster (&quot;Palinurus elephas&quot;) in ancient Roman times. The town itself was named for the legendary figure of Palinurus, who was a helmsman in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Æneid&quot;. 

In total, 12 extant genera are recognised, containing around 60 living species:

*&quot;Jasus&quot; 
*&quot;Justitia&quot; 
*&quot;Linuparus&quot; 
*&quot;Nupalirus&quot; 
*&quot;Palibythus&quot; 
*&quot;Palinurellus&quot; 
*&quot;Palinurus&quot; 
*&quot;Palinustus&quot; 
*&quot;Panulirus&quot; 
*&quot;Projasus&quot; 
*&quot;Puerulus&quot; 
*&quot;Sagmariasus&quot; 
== Description ==

Although they superficially resemble true lobsters in terms of overall shape and having a hard carapace and exoskeleton, the two groups are not closely related. Spiny lobsters can be easily distinguished from true lobsters by their very long, thick, spiny antennae, by the lack of chelae (claws) on the first four pairs of walking legs, although the females of most species have a small claw on the fifth pair, and by a particularly specialized larval phase called phyllosoma. True lobsters have much smaller antennae and claws on the first three pairs of legs, with the first being particularly enlarged.

Spiny lobsters typically have a slightly compressed carapace, lacking any lateral ridges. Their antennae lack a scaphocerite, the flattened exopod of the antenna. This is fused to the epistome (a plate between the labrum and the basis of the antenna). The flagellum, at the top of the antenna, is stout, tapering, and very long. The ambulatory legs (pereopods) end in claws (chelae).

== Size ==
The size of the adults varies from a few centimetres to 30–40 cm. In general, it is said that rarely some individuals can reach 60 cm (&quot;Panulirus argus&quot;).

Nevertheless, some reports – the authenticity of which can be questioned – are of much larger lobsters. One such source is Bernard Gorsky&#x27;s travel book &quot;La dernière île&quot;. In this, the author lists the following statements:

* According to a 1956 article from the New Caledonian daily newspaper &quot;La France Australe&quot; (published in Nyoma): &quot;Since yesterday, a so-called porcelain spiny lobster, stuffed, can be seen in the window of Balande. Its length is 2 m, (including its antennae) and it weighed 11 kg.
* Inhabitants of a small island in the Coral Sea caught a 2 m 10 cm, 17 kg porcelain spiny lobster, according to an Australian publication.
* Gorsky himself caught 6–7 kg lobsters with local tribesmen on the Loyalty Islands group&#x27;s Mouli island and mentioned them in the article in &quot;La France Australe&quot;. However, according to the locals, even bigger crabs can live there. According to the residents, a man from the Leikigne tribe (they live nearby on the other side of the Fayawa Strait) reported the following: he once went fishing with a friend and the friend drowned. He did not come to the surface, he followed him into the depths. Two legs protruded from a hollow, and in the hollow sat a huge crayfish, and it was eating the fisherman. The crawfish was said to be as thick as the trunk of a full-grown palm tree. (At the time, the locals (the people of Leikigne) gave credence to the report and believed that the victim could not have drowned because he swam &quot;like a dolphin&quot; – but a shark would not have killed him either, because there are usually no sharks in the lagoon there. According to them, only a lobster could be really responsible.) Since one of Gorsky&#x27;s narrators (&quot;Guy&quot;) was 20 years old at the time of the story (1965), and the incident occurred when he was 12, the story must have been around 1957 if true.
* A study was conducted regarding the effect of growth and survival when you change the frequency of feeding the Spiny Lobster and it was determined that if there is increased feed frequency from one to sixteen feeds daily then that is where growth and feed attraction are at the peak of their performance. If the lobsters are fed too much though, more than 16 feeds a day causes decreased feed intake and reduction in overall growth. It was also determined that the rapid leaching of feed suggests that there is a beneficial effect of feeding multiple frequencies on growth and intake.

==Fossil record==
The fossil record of spiny lobsters has been extended by the discovery in 1995 of a 110-million-year-old fossil near El Espiñal in Chiapas, Mexico. Workers from the National Autonomous University of Mexico have named the fossil &quot;Palinurus palaecosi&quot;, and report that it is closest to members of the genus &quot;Palinurus&quot; currently living off the coasts of Africa.

==Ecology==

Spiny lobsters are found in almost all warm seas, including the Caribbean and the Mediterranean Sea, but are particularly common in Australasia, where they are referred to commonly as crayfish or sea crayfish (&quot;Jasus edwardsii&quot;), and in South Africa (&quot;Jasus lalandii&quot;).

Spiny lobsters tend to live in crevices of rocks and coral reefs, only occasionally venturing out at night to seek snails, clams, sea-hares, crabs, or sea urchins to eat. They sometimes migrate in very large groups in long files of lobsters across the sea floor. These lines may be more than 50 lobsters long. Spiny lobsters navigate using the smell and taste of natural substances in the water that change in different parts of the ocean. It was recently discovered that spiny lobsters can also navigate by detecting the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. They keep together by contact, using their long antennae. Potential predators may be deterred from eating spiny lobsters by a loud screech made by the antennae of the spiny lobsters rubbing against a smooth part of the exoskeleton. Spiny lobsters usually exhibit the social habit of being together. However recent studies indicate that healthy lobsters move away from infected ones, leaving the diseased lobsters to fend for themselves.

Like true lobsters, spiny lobsters are edible and are an economically significant food source; they are the biggest food export of the Bahamas, for instance.

===Sound===
Many spiny lobsters produce rasping sounds to repel predators by rubbing the &quot;plectrum&quot; at the base of the spiny lobster&#x27;s antennae against a &quot;file&quot;. The noise is produced by frictional vibrations – sticking and slipping, similar to rubber materials sliding against hard surfaces. While a number of insects use frictional vibration mechanisms to generate sound, this particular acoustic mechanism is unique in the animal kingdom. Significantly, the system does not rely on the hardness of the exoskeleton, as many other arthropod sounds do, meaning that the spiny lobsters can continue to produce the deterrent noises even in the period following a moult when they are most vulnerable. The stridulating organ is present in all but three genera in the family (&quot;Jasus&quot;, &quot;Projasus&quot;, and the furry lobster &quot;Palinurellus&quot;), and its form can distinguish different species.

<text>Izhevsk or Ijevsk (, ; , or ) is the capital city of Udmurtia, Russia. It is situated along the Izh River, west of the Ural Mountains in Eastern Europe. It is the 21st-largest city in Russia, and the most populous in Udmurtia, with over 600,000 inhabitants.

From 1984 to 1987, the city was called Ustinov (), named after Soviet Minister of Defence Dmitry Ustinov. The city is a major hub of industry, commerce, politics, culture and education in the Volga Region. It is known for its defense, engineering and metallurgy industries. Izhevsk has the titles of the Armory Capital of Russia and the City of Labor Glory.

==History==
===Pioneer settlements===
The pioneer settlements on the territory where modern Izhevsk now stands were founded by Udmurts in the 5th century. There were two fortified settlements situated on the banks of the Karlutka River. Later this territory joined the Khanate of Kazan. In 1552, Russia conquered the Khanate and, in 1582, Ivan the Terrible conferred the lands by the Karlutka and Izh Rivers on Bagish Yaushev, a Tatar morza. The quit-rent had been imposed on the Udmurt population ever since. The Yaushevs owned the land until the reign of Peter the Great (1682–1721).

===Ironworks construction===
On September 15, 1757, Count Pyotr Shuvalov, owner of seven factories in the Urals, bought land in the Kama Region and got permission from Empress Elizabeth to build three ironworks there. In those days, ironworks were powered with steam, and wood was the only fuel. For that reason it was decided to build one of the plants on the forest-rich land near the Izh River and make iron bands and cast iron anchors. Another ironworks was built on the Votka River.

In April 10, 1760, serfs from neighboring villages and artisans from other Shuvalov&#x27;s plants began dam construction under the direction of Alexey Moskvin, a mining engineer and a trustee of Shuvalov. This date is considered to be the date of Izhevsk&#x27;s foundation. Construction proceeded at a slow pace. The serfs were unhappy with being taken from their villages, with arduous duties and regular physical punishment, leading to tumultuous rebellions.

In 1762 Shuvalov died. His son Andrey inherited the factories. In accordance with the ukase of Catherine the Great dated November 15, 1763, all Shuvalov&#x27;s ironworks, including the one at Izhevsky Zavod, lapsed to the Crown for debts. Since that time, it has been under the authority of the Collegium of Mining, an institution in charge of the Russian mining industry. The ironworks on the Izh and Votka Rivers were called Kama Plants.

In 1763 construction of the dam and ironworks was completed and the first bloomery iron was smelted. As a result of the dam construction, the Izhevsk Reservoir, one of the biggest in Europe was formed. Near the ironworks, the settlement was built. This settlement was named Izhevsky Zavod, meaning &quot;the factory on the Izh&quot; in Russian.

Initially the ironworks made palm-wide iron bands from long. These bands were supplied to Moscow for the rebuilding of the Kremlin. The iron from Izhevsky Zavod was also used for construction in Saint Petersburg.

===Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion===

In October 1773, the news of the popular revolt against Catherine II on the Yaik and the manifestos of Yemelyan Pugachev reached Izhevsky Zavod. The Cossack passing himself off as Peter III proclaimed liberty for serfs and called for killing nobles and factory owners. This had the backing of the serfs and artisans. So Colonel Feodor Wenzel, the manager of the Goroblagodat and Kama plants, and Aleksey Alymov, the manager of Izhevsky Zavod ironworks, were forced to escape to Kazan.

On January 1, 1774, a detachment of Yemelyan Pugachev&#x27;s rebel army reached the town. The rebels destroyed the ironworks, burned its office buildings, and wrecked the houses of the managers. They demolished the food depot and distributed the food to the people. The ironworks money was sent to the staff of the rebel army, near Ufa. The serfs were freed. Some of them joined the detachment. Iron production stopped for a while. Around this time, Catherine realized the seriousness of the rebellion and sent an army led by General Aleksandr Bibikov to crush the insurrection. In April 1774, Pugachev&#x27;s army fought losing battles everywhere and was forced to leave Izhevsky Zavod. The managers returned and cowed serfs and artisans into submission, forcing them to pledge allegiance to Catherine the Great. A list of workers who had joined the rebel army was compiled for future reprisal.

In spite of opposition from the forces of Wenzel and Alymov Brothers, Pugachev&#x27;s army occupied the town again on June 27, 1774. The crowds hailed Yemelyan Pugachev. He dealt with the complaints of serfs and workers for two days. Forty-two persons, including Wenzel and the Alymovs, were executed. On June 29, Pugachev left Izhevsky Zavod and set out for Kazan. Many workmen of Izhevsky Zavod joined his detachments and fought selflessly in the last battles of the Rebellion, which was mostly crushed by early September 1775. In spite of the defeat of the rebel army and the execution of its leader, bands of rebels continued to fight. New managers of the ironworks suppressed serfs and brought back artisans by force, cracking down on the bands of rebels.

The ironworks was restored and began to function by the end of 1775. The former order was reinstated. The forced laborers weren&#x27;t interested in boosting productivity and the practice fell into decay by the 19th century.

===Arms factory foundation===

In 1800, Emperor Paul I ordered an arms factory built in the Urals in view of a mounting threat from Napoleonic France. Andrew Deryabin, a mining engineer, chief of Goroblagodat, Perm, Kama and Bogoslov plants, chose the site for the new plant. He saw several places in the Perm and Vyatka governorates and concluded that the most suitable place for plant foundation was Izh Zavod. It occurred to him to turn the ironworks into the armory.

Alexander I approved of Deryabin&#x27;s project and construction began on the arms factory building on June 10, 1807, considered the year of Izhevsk&#x27;s second birth.

The new factory had a shortage of manpower. Staff vacancies were filled by serfs, workmen from Urals mining plants and recruits. Armorers were transferred from other arms factories and hired from Europe, mainly from Denmark and Sweden.

The population of the settlement grew quickly so that by the end of 1808 there were more than 6,000 inhabitants. Because of housing requirements, people had to build their houses after work, at night. Houses were made from wood found in forests near the factory. At the same time, workers built new barracks for the soldiers and housing for factory employees, officers and officials, the hospital, schools and other social facilities.

===Dudin&#x27;s plan===

The settlement was built according to the master plan. Architect Feodor Dudin was an author of this plan and a director of all construction works. The principle of an urban grid was the basis of the new master plan. Wide and straight streets crossed side streets running perpendicular to them. Their accurate network formed small rectangular blocks.

On May 18, 1810, a major fire burned in Izhevsky Zavod. 174 houses, the warehouse, and two wooden churches were destroyed.

After the fire, implementation of Dudin&#x27;s plan began. The houses were made of pinewood logs. As a rule, a house consisted of two &quot;izbas&quot;, joined with an inner porch. Houses of the poor consisted of one &quot;izba&quot;. Armorers and officials erected two-storied and five-wall log houses. There were 15 streets in Izh by the 1820s. In 1812, Izhevsky Zavod was divided into three administrative parts because of growth in population and territory. In 1816, there were 1,710 houses, 8 factory stone buildings, a prison, a cemetery, a stone church and a school in the settlement. The population was 8,324.

In the 1820s, 1830s, and 1840s, a number of large stone building was erected. St. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral was built between 1818 and 1823, and visited by Tsar Alexander (who considered Alexander Nevsky his patron saint) shortly after its completion. Other noteworthy large stone buildings which still remain from that era include the Arsenal (1823–25), Public Offices (1843–45) and house of contractor Egor Novikov. All improved Izhevsk&#x27;s appearance.

By 1850, the settlement had more than doubled, to population of 19,163. Its territory was about 6200 square miles. 3499 buildings were wooden, and 27 others, including three churches, were made of stone. The settlement had 1066 wells.

===Izhevsky Zavod after the Emancipation Reform of 1861===

On February 19, 1861, Emperor of Russia Alexander II carried out the Emancipation Reform. On October 9, 1865, Berg-kollegia, apprehending a prospective cost increase, leased the arms factory to a partnership of industrialists.

In 1866, serfs of the factory obtained their liberty with the 1861 Emancipation Manifesto and gained self-government. Izhevsky Zavod was divided into two volosts: Nagornaya Volost and Zarechnaya Volost, or Zareka. Each volost had its board of administration and consisted of rural groups. Rural circles were headed by a &quot;starosta&quot;, selected in the gathering. There were seven rural societies in Nagornaya Volost; Zarechnaya Volost consisted of four.

Administrations of volosts reported to the Board of Sarapul Zemstvo. They were led by volost &quot;starshinas&quot;, elected for three years. Volost administrations were in charge of doing duty and paying taxes. They issued passports, managed improvement of territory and other local affairs.

Administrative and police oversight was carried out by the factory administration. Besides the administration delivered documents of title to land and house. The ponds, pastures and hayfields were turned over to the armorers and artisans.

The abolition of serfdom aggravated wealth inequalities between the inhabitants of Izhevsky Zavod. Well-to-do sections of population included the factory management, skilled armorers and artisans, administrative professionals, officials, clergy and merchants. Such stratification had an influence on view of the settlement. Working people were driven out of Nagornaya Part and settled in boggy Zareka. At that time, Koltoma, another working-class locality, grew. In the early 1870s, there were about twenty private stone buildings in Izhevsky Zavod. In Zarechnaya Part all houses were made of wood.

Civic life depended on government contract work. In the years of war or army re-equipment, the orders grew, and so did the workforce and labour earnings. After the government orders were filled and wages were cut, most workmen left the arms factory and the settlement fell into decay until the next government contract.

===Enterprises in Izhevsky Zavod===

In 1872, the steel works was founded in Izhevsky Zavod. In 1884, the arms factory and the steel works passed to the state.

Private armories appeared in Izhevsky Zavod.

*In 1860, an armorer named Ivan Fyodorovich Petrov began making hunting rifles at a small armory in Zaręka. Later, he set up shop in Yekaterinburg, Omsk, Nizhny Novgorod and the Caucasus. He and his sons also sold gunpowder in Izhevsky Zavod. One of his sons, Vasily, later opened his own armory.
*Andrian Nikandrovich Evdokimov was a competitor of the Petrovs. He had the armory on Bazarnaya Street.
*Nikolay Ilyich Berezin built his enterprise on Bazarnaya Street, too. He produced guns. He also owned a small iron foundry in the northeast suburbs.
*Merchants Porsev and Kilin were the owners of two brick factories.

There were twelve private industrial enterprises in Izhevsky Zavod by 1914.

===Izhevsky Zavod merchants===

In the 1870s, trade blossomed in Izhevsky Zavod. The Bodalev Brothers, Mokletsov, Ogloblin, Sveshnikov and Sozykin were the most successful merchants. It was profitable to deal in spirits. There were three vodka distilleries, four wine warehouses, three wine cellars, and about fifty taverns in 1872. This year Ivan Bodalev opened his brewery on the bank of the reservoir.

===Religious buildings===
At the turn of the 19th century, there were four temples in Izhevsky Zavod. St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral was built between 1897 and 1915.

Izhevsky Zavod was one of the residence centers of the Udmurt Jews, who spoke &quot;Udmurtish&quot; &quot;Yiddish&quot;. In the workmen&#x27;s settlement since 1849 under the Jewish religious needs the house of worship was allocated. A second prayer house was opened in 1917. Both synagogues were closed in 1930 by the Soviet authorities.

===The Russian Revolution and the Russian Civil War===

On March 5, 1917, workers at the plant formed a worker&#x27;s soviet, which included representatives of the workers, the army and of other citizens. Two days later the factory administration resigned. By mid-September of the same year, Bolsheviks took control of both the council and its influential newspaper. On October 27, 1917, Soviet government was officially announced, with the council officially dissolved soon thereafter. 

The former leaders of the council were arrested in June 1918, contributing to an uprising against Bolshevik rule. The struggle for control of the city continued until the arrival of the Red Army, which took Izhevsk on November 7. On April 13, 1919, the city was occupied by units of Admiral Kolchak&#x27;s White Army, only to fall again, this time decisively, to another assault by the Red Army in June 8 of the same year.

===The Soviet period===
The Soviet period saw significant growth in the size and importance of Izhevsk. In 1921, the city became the administrative center of Votsk Autonomous Oblast, a precursor to the Udmurt Republic. On December 28, 1934, Izhevsk received status of capital of the Udmurt Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The first tramline was opened in 1935. It was 5 km long.

On March 14, 1937, the Republic&#x27;s constitution was adopted. It consolidated the capital status of Izhevsk. In the autumn of 1941 several defense-related plants evacuated to Izhevsk. In June, 1943, Izhevsk Mechanical Plant was founded. During World War II, Izhevsk plants produced 12 and a half million small arms.
World War II had a profound effect on the city; much of the industrial infrastructure evacuated from the western regions of the Soviet Union was relocated to the city. Elements of the evacuated enterprises were used to create the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant, which remains an important manufacturer of military components.
Military industry remained the core of the local economy after the war, so Izhvesk was designated a closed city, inaccessible to foreigners. The city&#x27;s Izhmash factory began manufacturing the AK-47 automatic rifle in 1948, and continues to produce modern variants of the design to this day. The rifle&#x27;s designer, Mikhail Kalashnikov lived in Izhevsk until his death in 2013. In 1966, Izhmash began manufacturing the Izh brand of automobiles.

In 1984, the city was renamed Ustinov; in honor of former minister of defense Dmitry Ustinov. Three years later, despite vocal protests by a significant number of citizens, Izhevsk regained its historical name.

Izhevsk weathered the post-Soviet years reasonably well, carried through by the continued demand for its military products. The city remains an important industrial and military center of the country, referred to as the &quot;Armory of Russia&quot;, a title it shares with the city of Tula.

===2022 school shooting===

On 26 September 2022, Artem Kazantsev, a former pupil, committed a mass shooting at School No. 88 in the city. Eighteen people, including eleven children, were killed, and 24 others were injured. The school has about 1,000 pupils. Kazantsev later killed himself at the scene.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Izhevsk is the capital of the republic. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the city of republic significance of Izhevsk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of republic significance of Izhevsk is incorporated as Izhevsk Urban Okrug.

==Demographics==
Population: 

According to the 2010 census, the capital of Udmurtia is home to more than 100 ethnicities. More than two-thirds of residents are Russians (68.8%). Other groups include Udmurts (14.8%), Tatars (8.9%), Ukrainians, Belarusians, Mari, Bashkirs, Chuvash, Armenians, Jews and Germans.

Izhevsk was one of the homes of the Udmurt Jews. Jews have lived in Izhevsk since the 1830s.

==Economy==
Izhevsk is the most important economic center of the Udmurt Republic, with the majority of financial and industrial activity concentrated in the city. Military industry remains the backbone of the local economy, with a number of enterprises operating in the city. By far the most important of these is Izhmash, which produces small arms and assault rifles popular both in Russia and abroad. The plant also produces motorcycles and automobiles under IZH brandname.

In 2006, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez visited Izhevsk to tour the Izhmash manufacturing center where he announced his government&#x27;s intention to purchase a large number of Izhevsk-produced rifles.

==Transport==
City public transport included buses, trolleybuses and trams. The main railway station is located in the southern part of the city, and the Izhevsk Airport is located east of the city.
==Climate==
Izhevsk has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with long, cold winters and short, warm summers. Summers are quite a bit warmer than at corresponding latitudes in Western Europe, courtesy of the city&#x27;s far inland location. Winters are a lot colder than said areas, also due to the distance from the North Atlantic, which results in limited temperature moderation. Even so, winters are a lot less severe than those in Russian cities east of the Ural Mountains.

An extreme July temperature of was recorded during the 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves, although the highest temperature recorded is in August 2021.

==Life and culture==
===Education===

Izhevsk is the scientific and cultural center of the Udmurt Republic. Early on, the state took a leading role in childcare and education. 320 Public kindergartens/ preschools provide affordable childcare for 32,000 children. 100 public schools provide free general education to over 100,000 Izhevsk students. A wide variety of technical colleges and two-year professional schools award associate degrees, most notably in medical assistance, performing arts and teaching.

The Ural department of the Russian Scientific Academy is represented in Izhevsk by several institutions, specializing in physics, applied mechanics and technical sciences, and economics, and the Institute of History, Language and Literature of Udmurtia does the same.

Four out of five higher education institutes in the Udmurt Republic are located in Izhevsk: Udmurt State University, Izhevsk State Technical University, Agricultural Academy, and Izhevsk State Medical Academy. Each of these educational institutions admits foreign students.

Udmurt State University celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2006. It is the oldest educational institution in the Udmurt Republic. Some 28,000 students are currently studying at the university, which offers 86 different majors. The university has thirteen departments and seven institutes. Out of 1,000 faculty members 130 hold Doctor of Science (Dr.Sc.) degrees, and 460 are Candidates of Sciences (Cand.Sc., equivalent to first year of Ph.D.). UdSU graduate school offers 11 attestation committees qualified to award Cand.Sc. and Dr.Sc. degrees in ecology, economics, law, psychology, pedagogics, ethnology, history, culture, linguistics of the Ural region, and Udmurt linguistics.

Izhevsk is a pilot city of the Council of Europe and European Commission Intercultural cities programme.

The Kalashnikov Museum and Exhibition Complex of Small Arms, or the Kalashnikov Museum, opened in 2004. Its expositions tell about Izhevsk as one of the most important centers of Russian arms production. The main person of the museum narration is Mikhail Kalashnikov. The museum and exhibition complex holds the permanent exposition devoted to this legendary Russian armourer. There are temporary expositions in addition to the permanent exposition launched in 2004. The Museum has a demonstration hall, including the shooting gallery where different models of historical and contemporary arms are presented, and the pneumatic shooting gallery.

17 kilometers from Izhevsk is the Ludorvay Architectural and Ethnographic Open-air Museum. It was founded in 1990 on the premises of the former Russian settlement Ilyinka. Total area of the culture preserve is about 40 hectares. It divided into five exhibition parts: the Sector of Central Udmurts, the Sector of Southern Udmurts, Russian sector, the Windmill, and the Mushtor Apiary Complex.

*State Philharmonic of the Udmurt Republic.

===Circus===

One of the integral parts of Izhevsk cultural life is the State Circus of the Udmurt Republic. Residents of Izhevsk have liked circus throughout the history of the city. In olden days the settlement was visited by vagrant performers — skomorokhs with mountain bears, strongmen and fakirs. Since the turn of the 19th century, shows took places in booths — temporary structures with benches for the rich and standing room for the poor.

The first Izhevsk circus was built by Aleksandr Koromyslov in 1895. It had existed until the Civil War began.
On 21 September 1926, the Kolart Circus was opened. It was made of wood and seated 1,500 spectators.

In 1943, at the height of The Great Patriotic War, the stone circus building was erected in the Kolart&#x27;s place. It was designed by P.M. Popov after the pattern of Ciniselli Circus in Saint Petersburg. On 29 November 1943, wounded soldiers saw the first show there. The Circus seated 1,800 spectators and was considered one of the best in the Soviet Union.

On January 14, 1990, the Circus was closed because of dilapidation. On 29 December 1999, the building was razed.

On January 17, 2000, a cornerstone of new circus was laid. The project was designed by Moscow architect Mikhail Vesnin. In the judgment of specialists, the contemporary building of the Circus is one of the best in Russia. It seats 1,800 spectators like the predecessor and has current technologies and high-performance audio and light equipment.

The International Circus Art Festival has been held at the State Circus of the Udmurt Republic yearly in March since 2008. Circus stars come to Izhevsk from every corner of the globe. Some of the world&#x27;s leading circus art festivals and circus managers and producers join the festival jury.

===Sports===

The Izhevsk ice hockey team HC Izhstal plays in the Supreme Hockey League. In the season 2013-14 the team finished the regular season 19th and failed to qualify for the playoffs.

The football club Zenit-Izhevsk plays in the Russian Professional Football League. In the season 2013-14 the team finished fifth in the zone Ural-Povolzhye.

The women&#x27;s handball team Universitet plays in Russian Superleague.

The sledge hockey team Udmurtia was twice champion of Russia (2010, 2014).

===Entertainment===
In the post-Soviet period, Izhevsk became known as home to a vibrant art and music scene. Izhevsk is sometimes referred to as &quot;the capital of Russian electronic music&quot;. The most well-known Izhevsk electronic act was Стук Бамбука в XI Часов (&quot;Stuk Bambuka v XI Chasov&quot;), whose only album &quot;Лёгкое дело холод&quot; (1991) is now considered classic.

Currently the music scene continues to evolve creating new talents such as Anna Krab calling herself the Electronic Queen of Udmurtia and Distract-a-bee with a dick-logo tending to release an album every week.

Italmas (Италмас) is an Udmurt folk theater and dance company.

==Cityscape==

===Notable buildings and structures===

*Alexander Nevsky Cathedral is a Neoclassical building from 1823 patterned after St. Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral in Kronstadt (whose architect was Andreyan Zakharov)
*St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral was built by the Izhevsk arms works in the early 20th century, destroyed by the Bolsheviks and rebuilt to the original design in 2007
*Pesochnaya TV Mast (195-m tall guyed tubular steel mast built in 1962, which is equipped with six crossbars running in two levels from the mast structure to the guys)

===Pond===
Izhvesk City Pond&#x27;s area is over 22 km2, yet it was artificially constructed (in parts dug by hand) in the 1760s for industrial needs. Empress Elizabeth of Russia granted Count Peter Shuvalov official permission to create three factories in the Kama River region September 15, 1757.
Construction of the three-step industrial dam at the critical point where the two rivers (Izh and Yagul/Podborenka) join started both the pond and the city in April 1760.

The dam was reconstructed in 1809–1815 when Andrey Fedorovich Deryabin converted the original metalworking factory into the new arms producing facility. It was subsequently modernized again in 1983–1984 in order to extend the dam. Today a number of major Izhevsk industrial plants are still located along the pond.

In 1972, the Izhevsk Pond Embankment, a three-mile-long walkway and a system of boulevards and squares, was extended along the pond. The &quot;Friendship of Nations&quot; Square, with its central monument celebrating 400 years of Udmurtia&#x27;s union with Russia, is a focal point of the esplanade and a hip place for youth recreation. During the summer months excursion boats operate from Izhevsk to the village of Volozhka.

<text>The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (, ) is a commonly used analytical biochemistry assay, first described by Eva Engvall and Peter Perlmann in 1971. The assay is a solid-phase type of enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to detect the presence of a ligand (commonly a protein) in a liquid sample using antibodies directed against the ligand to be measured. ELISA has been used as a diagnostic tool in medicine, plant pathology, and biotechnology, as well as a quality control check in various industries.

In the most simple form of an ELISA, antigens from the sample to be tested are attached to a surface. Then, a matching antibody is applied over the surface so it can bind the antigen. This antibody is linked to an enzyme and then any unbound antibodies are removed. In the final step, a substance containing the enzyme&#x27;s substrate is added. If there was binding, the subsequent reaction produces a detectable signal, most commonly a color change.

Performing an ELISA involves at least one antibody with specificity for a particular antigen. The sample with an unknown amount of antigen is immobilized on a solid support (usually a polystyrene microtiter plate) either non-specifically (via adsorption to the surface) or specifically (via capture by another antibody specific to the same antigen, in a &quot;sandwich&quot; ELISA). After the antigen is immobilized, the detection antibody is added, forming a complex with the antigen. The detection antibody can be covalently linked to an enzyme or can itself be detected by a secondary antibody that is linked to an enzyme through bioconjugation. Between each step, the plate is typically washed with a mild detergent solution to remove any proteins or antibodies that are non-specifically bound. After the final wash step, the plate is developed by adding an enzymatic substrate to produce a visible signal, which indicates the quantity of antigen in the sample.

Of note, ELISA can perform other forms of ligand binding assays instead of strictly &quot;immuno&quot; assays, though the name carried the original &quot;immuno&quot; because of the common use and history of development of this method. The technique essentially requires any ligating reagent that can be immobilized on the solid phase along with a detection reagent that will bind specifically and use an enzyme to generate a signal that can be properly quantified. In between the washes, only the ligand and its specific binding counterparts remain specifically bound or &quot;immunosorbed&quot; by antigen-antibody interactions to the solid phase, while the nonspecific or unbound components are washed away. Unlike other spectrophotometric wet lab assay formats where the same reaction well (e.g., a cuvette) can be reused after washing, the ELISA plates have the reaction products immunosorbed on the solid phase, which is part of the plate, and so are not easily reusable.

==Principle==
As an analytical biochemistry assay and a &quot;wet lab&quot; technique, ELISA involves detection of an analyte (i.e., the specific substance whose presence is being quantitatively or qualitatively analyzed) in a liquid sample by a method that continues to use liquid reagents during the analysis (i.e., controlled sequence of biochemical reactions that will generate a signal which can be easily quantified and interpreted as a measure of the amount of analyte in the sample) that stays liquid and remains inside a reaction chamber or well needed to keep the reactants contained. This is in contrast to &quot;dry lab&quot; techniques that use dry strips. Even if the sample is liquid (e.g., a measured small drop), the final detection step in &quot;dry&quot; analysis involves reading of a dried strip by methods such as reflectometry and does not need a reaction containment chamber to prevent spillover or mixing between samples. 

As a heterogenous assay, ELISA separates some component of the analytical reaction mixture by adsorbing certain components onto a solid phase which is physically immobilized. In ELISA, a liquid sample is added onto a stationary solid phase with special binding properties and is followed by multiple liquid reagents that are sequentially added, incubated, and washed, followed by some optical change (e.g., color development by the product of an enzymatic reaction) in the final liquid in the well from which the quantity of the analyte is measured. The quantitative &quot;reading&quot; is usually based on detection of intensity of transmitted light by spectrophotometry, which involves quantitation of transmission of some specific wavelength of light through the liquid (as well as the transparent bottom of the well in the multiple-well plate format). The sensitivity of detection depends on amplification of the signal during the analytic reactions. Since enzyme reactions are very well known amplification processes, the signal is generated by enzymes which are linked to the detection reagents in fixed proportions to allow accurate quantification, and thus the name &quot;enzyme-linked&quot;.

The analyte is also called the ligand because it will specifically bind or ligate to a detection reagent, thus ELISA falls under the bigger category of ligand binding assays. The ligand-specific binding reagent is &quot;immobilized&quot;, i.e., usually coated and dried onto the transparent bottom and sometimes also side wall of a well (the stationary &quot;solid phase&quot;/&quot;solid substrate&quot; here as opposed to solid microparticle/beads that can be washed away), which is usually constructed as a multiple-well plate known as the &quot;ELISA plate&quot;. Conventionally, like other forms of immunoassays, the specificity of antigen-antibody type reaction is used because it is easy to raise an antibody specifically against an antigen in bulk as a reagent. Alternatively, if the analyte itself is an antibody, its target antigen can be used as the binding reagent.

==History==

Before the development of the ELISA, the only option for conducting an immunoassay was radioimmunoassay, a technique using radioactively labeled antigens or antibodies. In radioimmunoassay, the radioactivity provides the signal, which indicates whether a specific antigen or antibody is present in the sample. Radioimmunoassay was first described in a scientific paper by Rosalyn Sussman Yalow and Solomon Berson published in 1960.

As radioactivity poses a potential health threat, a safer alternative was sought. A suitable alternative to radioimmunoassay would substitute a nonradioactive signal in place of the radioactive signal. When enzymes (such as horseradish peroxidase) react with appropriate substrates (such as ABTS or TMB), a change in color occurs, which is used as a signal. However, the signal has to be associated with the presence of antibody or antigen, which is why the enzyme has to be linked to an appropriate antibody. This linking process was independently developed by Stratis Avrameas and G. B. Pierce. Since it is necessary to remove any unbound antibody or antigen by washing, the antibody or antigen has to be fixed to the surface of the container; i.e., the immunosorbent must be prepared. A technique to accomplish this was published by Wide and Jerker Porath in 1966.

In 1971, Peter Perlmann and Eva Engvall at Stockholm University in Sweden, and Anton Schuurs and Bauke van Weemen in the Netherlands independently published papers that synthesized this knowledge into methods to perform EIA/ELISA.

Traditional ELISA typically involves chromogenic reporters and substrates that produce some kind of observable color change to indicate the presence of antigen or analyte. Newer ELISA-like techniques use fluorogenic, electrochemiluminescent, and quantitative PCR reporters to create quantifiable signals. These new reporters can have various advantages, including higher sensitivities and multiplexing. In technical terms, newer assays of this type are not strictly ELISAs, as they are not &quot;enzyme-linked&quot;, but are instead linked to some nonenzymatic reporter. However, given that the general principles in these assays are largely similar, they are often grouped in the same category as ELISAs.

In 2012, an ultrasensitive, enzyme-based ELISA test using nanoparticles as a chromogenic reporter was able to give a naked-eye colour signal, from the detection of mere attograms of analyte. A blue color appears for positive results and red color for negative. Note that this detection only can confirm the presence or the absence of analyte, not the actual concentration.

==Types==
There are many ELISA tests for particular molecules that use the matching antibodies. ELISA tests are broken into several types of tests based on how the analytes and antibodies are bonded and used. The major types are described here.

=== Direct ===
The steps of direct ELISA follows the mechanism below:
* A buffered solution of the antigen to be tested for is added to each well (usually 96-well plates) of a microtiter plate, where it is given time to adhere to the plastic through charge interactions.
* A solution of nonreacting protein, such as bovine serum albumin or casein, is added to each well in order to cover any plastic surface in the well which remains uncoated by the antigen.
* The primary antibody with an attached (conjugated) enzyme is added, which binds specifically to the test antigen coating the well.
* A substrate for this enzyme is then added. Often, this substrate changes color upon reaction with the enzyme. 
* The higher the concentration of the primary antibody present in the serum, the stronger the color change. Often, a spectrometer is used to give quantitative values for color strength.

The enzyme acts as an amplifier; even if only few enzyme-linked antibodies remain bound, the enzyme molecules will produce many signal molecules. Within common-sense limitations, the enzyme can go on producing color indefinitely, but the more antibody is bound, the faster the color will develop. A major disadvantage of the direct ELISA is that the method of antigen immobilization is not specific; when serum is used as the source of test antigen, all proteins in the sample may stick to the microtiter plate well, so small concentrations of analyte in serum must compete with other serum proteins when binding to the well surface. The sandwich or indirect ELISA provides a solution to this problem, by using a &quot;capture&quot; antibody specific for the test antigen to pull it out of the serum&#x27;s molecular mixture.

ELISA may be run in a qualitative or quantitative format. Qualitative results provide a simple positive or negative result (yes or no) for a sample. The cutoff between positive and negative is determined by the analyst and may be statistical. Two or three times the standard deviation (error inherent in a test) is often used to distinguish positive from negative samples. In quantitative ELISA, the optical density (OD) of the sample is compared to a standard curve, which is typically a serial dilution of a known-concentration solution of the target molecule. For example, if a test sample returns an OD of 1.0, the point on the standard curve that gave OD = 1.0 must be of the same analyte concentration as the sample.

The use and meaning of the names &quot;indirect ELISA&quot; and &quot;direct ELISA&quot; differs in the literature and on web sites depending on the context of the experiment. When the presence of an antigen is analyzed, the name &quot;direct ELISA&quot; refers to an ELISA in which only a labelled primary antibody is used, and the term &quot;indirect ELISA&quot; refers to an ELISA in which the antigen is bound by the primary antibody which then is detected by a labeled secondary antibody. In the latter case a sandwich ELISA is clearly distinct from an indirect ELISA. When the &quot;primary&quot; antibody is of interest, e.g. in the case of immunization analyses, this antibody is directly detected by the secondary antibody and the term &quot;indirect ELISA&quot; applies to a setting with two antibodies.

===Sandwich===
A &quot;sandwich&quot; ELISA is used to detect sample antigen. The steps are:

# A surface is prepared with a known quantity of capture antibody.
# Any nonspecific binding sites on the surface are blocked.
# The antigen-containing sample is applied to the plate, and captured by antibody.
# The plate is washed to remove unbound antigen.
# A specific antibody is added, and binds to antigen (hence the &#x27;sandwich&#x27;: the antigen is stuck between two antibodies). This primary antibody could be in the serum of a donor, to be tested for reactivity towards the antigen.
# Enzyme-linked secondary antibodies are applied as detection antibodies, which bind specifically to the antibody&#x27;s Fc region (nonspecific).
# The plate is washed to remove the unbound antibody-enzyme conjugates.
# A chemical is added to be converted by the enzyme into a color, fluorescent, or electrochemical signal.
# The absorbance, fluorescence, or electrochemical signal (e.g., current) of the plate&#x27;s wells is measured to determine the presence and quantity of the antigen.

The image to the right includes the use of a secondary antibody conjugated to an enzyme, although, in the technical sense, this is not necessary if the primary antibody is conjugated to an enzyme (which would be direct ELISA). However, the use of a secondary-antibody conjugate avoids the expensive process of creating enzyme-linked antibodies for every antigen one might want to detect. By using an enzyme-linked antibody that binds the Fc region of other antibodies, this same enzyme-linked antibody can be used in a variety of situations. Without the first layer of &quot;capture&quot; antibody, any proteins in the sample (including serum proteins) may competitively adsorb to the plate surface, lowering the quantity of antigen immobilized. Use of the purified specific antibody to attach the antigen to the plastic eliminates a need to purify the antigen from complicated mixtures before the measurement, simplifying the assay, and increasing the specificity and the sensitivity of the assay. Therefore, a sandwich ELISA used for research often needs validation, to reduce the risk of false positive results.

===Competitive===
A third use of ELISA is through competitive binding. The steps for this ELISA are somewhat different from the first two examples:

Unlabeled antibody is incubated in the presence of its antigen (sample).
# These bound antibody/antigen complexes are then added to an antigen-coated well.
# The plate is washed, so unbound antibodies are removed. (The more antigen in the sample, the more Ag-Ab complexes are formed and so there are less unbound antibodies available to bind to the antigen in the well, hence &quot;competition&quot;.)
# The secondary antibody, specific to the primary antibody, is added. This second antibody is coupled to the enzyme.
# A substrate is added, and remaining enzymes elicit a chromogenic or fluorescent signal.
# The reaction is stopped to prevent eventual saturation of the signal.

Some competitive ELISA kits include enzyme-linked antigen rather than enzyme-linked antibody. The labeled antigen competes for primary antibody binding sites with the sample antigen (unlabeled). The less antigen in the sample, the more labeled antigen is retained in the well and the stronger the signal.

Commonly, the antigen is not first positioned in the well.

For the detection of HIV antibodies, the wells of microtiter plate are coated with the HIV antigen. Two specific antibodies are used, one conjugated with enzyme and the other present in serum (if serum is positive for the antibody). Cumulative competition occurs between the two antibodies for the same antigen, causing a stronger signal to be seen. Sera to be tested are added to these wells and incubated at 37 °C, and then washed. If antibodies are present, the antigen-antibody reaction occurs. No antigen is left for the enzyme-labelled specific HIV antibodies. These antibodies remain free upon addition and are washed off during washing. Substrate is added, but there is no enzyme to act on it, so a positive result shows no color change.

===Indirect===
A fourth ELISA test does not use the traditional wells, rather leaves the antigens suspended in the test fluid.

# Unlabeled antibody is incubated in the presence of its antigen (sample)
# A sufficient incubation period is provided to allow the antibodies to bind to the antigens.
# The sample is then passed through the Scavenger container. This can be a test tube or a specifically designed flow through channel. The surface of the Scavenger container or channel has &quot;Scavenger Antigens&quot; bound to it. These can be identical or sufficiently similar to the primary antigens that the free antibodies will bind.
# The Scavenger container must have sufficient surface area and sufficient time to allow the Scavenger Antigens to bind to all the excess Antibodies introduced into the sample.
# The sample, that now contains the tagged and bound antibodies, is passed through a detector. This device can be a flow cytometer or other device that illuminates the tags and registers the response.

This test allows multiple antigens to be tagged and counted at the same time. This allows specific strains of bacteria to be identified by two (or more) different color tags. If both tags are present on a cell, then the cell is that specific strain. If only one is present, it is not.

This test is done, generally, one test at a time and cannot be done with the microtiter plate. The equipment needed is usually less complicated and can be used in the field.

== Commonly used enzymatic markers ==
The following table lists the enzymatic markers commonly used in ELISA assays, which allow the results of the assay to be measured upon completion.
* OPD (&quot;o&quot;-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride) turns amber to detect HRP (horseradish peroxidase), which is often used to as a conjugated protein.
* TMB (3,3&#x27;,5,5&#x27;-tetramethylbenzidine) turns blue when detecting HRP and turns yellow after the addition of sulfuric or phosphoric acid.
* ABTS (2,2&#x27;-Azinobis [3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid]-diammonium salt) turns green when detecting HRP.
* PNPP (&quot;p&quot;-Nitrophenyl Phosphate, Disodium Salt) turns yellow when detecting alkaline phosphatase.

==Applications==
Because the ELISA can be performed to evaluate either the presence of antigen or the presence of antibody in a sample, it is a useful tool for determining serum antibody concentrations (such as with the HIV test or West Nile virus). It has also found applications in the food industry in detecting potential food allergens, such as milk, peanuts, walnuts, almonds, and eggs and as serological blood test for coeliac disease. ELISA can also be used in toxicology as a rapid presumptive screen for certain classes of drugs.

The ELISA was the first screening test widely used for HIV because of its high sensitivity. In an ELISA, a person&#x27;s serum is diluted 400 times and applied to a plate to which HIV antigens are attached. If antibodies to HIV are present in the serum, they may bind to these HIV antigens. The plate is then washed to remove all other components of the serum. A specially prepared &quot;secondary antibody&quot;—an antibody that binds to other antibodies—is then applied to the plate, followed by another wash. This secondary antibody is chemically linked in advance to an enzyme.

Thus, the plate will contain enzyme in proportion to the amount of secondary antibody bound to the plate. A substrate for the enzyme is applied, and catalysis by the enzyme leads to a change in color or fluorescence. ELISA results are reported as a number; the most controversial aspect of this test is determining the &quot;cut-off&quot; point between a positive and a negative result.

A cut-off point may be determined by comparing it with a known standard. If an ELISA test is used for drug screening at workplace, a cut-off concentration, 50 ng/ml, for example, is established, and a sample containing the standard concentration of analyte will be prepared. Unknowns that generate a stronger signal than the known sample are &quot;positive&quot;. Those that generate weaker signal are &quot;negative&quot;.

There are ELISA tests to detect various kind of diseases, such as dengue, malaria, Chagas disease, Johne&#x27;s disease, and others. ELISA tests also are extensively employed for &quot;in vitro&quot; diagnostics in medical laboratories. The other uses of ELISA include:

* detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood samples
ELISA is as of 2023 the primary method of plant pathogen detection worldwide.

==Enzyme-Linked Single Molecule Array (eSimoa)==
eSimoa (enzyme-linked single molecule array) represents a significant evolution of the traditional ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) technique, which is widely utilized in clinical diagnostics and research. By significantly enhancing the sensitivity and resolution of biomolecular detection, eSimoa expands the capabilities of ELISA, enabling the detection of biomolecules at concentrations previously unachievable with standard assays.

===Technology===
Building on the foundational principles of ELISA, eSimoa employs paramagnetic beads to isolate biomolecules or enzymes in a manner akin to ELISA’s plate-based detection. However, eSimoa advances this concept by enabling enzymatic reaction measurements at the single-molecule level, which dramatically improves detection limits for various enzymes and biomolecules. This method allows for the precise quantification of low-abundance proteins and the activity of critical enzymes such as protein kinases and telomerases, which are often below the detection threshold of conventional ELISA.

===Applications===
The enhanced sensitivity of eSimoa is crucial for early and accurate biomarker detection in clinical diagnostics, facilitating better disease monitoring and management. In drug discovery, the ability to track subtle changes in enzymatic activity aids in the development of more effective pharmaceuticals by providing detailed insights into enzyme inhibition mechanisms.

===Origins and Controversy===
Chi-An Cheng at National Taiwan University (NTU) has claimed that her team developed this innovative technology. However, this claim is contested by the existence of prior publications by David R. Walt&#x27;s team at Harvard University, who published their work on eSimoa in 2020. This earlier documentation by Walt&#x27;s team suggests a prior contribution to the development of the technology.

<doc id="95164" wikidata="Q546359" url="?curid=95164" title="Doo-wop">
<text>Doo-wop (also spelled doowop and doo wop) is a subgenre of rhythm and blues music that originated in African-American communities during the 1940s, mainly in the large cities of the United States, including New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Baltimore, Newark, Detroit, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. It features vocal group harmony that carries an engaging melodic line to a simple beat with little or no instrumentation. Lyrics are simple, usually about love, sung by a lead vocal over background vocals, and often featuring, in the bridge, a melodramatically heartfelt recitative addressed to the beloved. Harmonic singing of nonsense syllables (such as &quot;doo-wop&quot;) is a common characteristic of these songs. Gaining popularity in the 1950s, doo-wop was commercially viable until the early 1960s and continued to influence performers in other genres.

==Origins==

Doo-wop has complex musical, social, and commercial origins.

===Musical precedents===
Doo-wop&#x27;s style is a mixture of precedents in composition, orchestration, and vocals that figured in American popular music created by songwriters and vocal groups, both black and white, from the 1930s to the 1940s.

Such composers as Rodgers and Hart (in their 1934 song &quot;Blue Moon&quot;), and Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser (in their 1938 &quot;Heart and Soul&quot;) used a I–vi–ii–V-loop chord progression in those hit songs; composers of doo-wop songs varied this slightly but significantly to the chord progression I–vi–IV–V, so influential that it is sometimes referred to as the &#x27;50s progression. This characteristic harmonic layout was combined with the AABA chorus form typical for Tin Pan Alley songs.

Hit songs by black groups such as the Ink Spots (&quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Care&quot;, one of the best selling singles worldwide of all time, and &quot;Address Unknown&quot;) and the Mills Brothers (&quot;Paper Doll&quot;, &quot;You Always Hurt the One You Love&quot; and &quot;Glow Worm&quot;) were generally slow songs in swing time with simple instrumentation. Doo-wop street singers generally performed without instrumentation, but made their musical style distinctive, whether using fast or slow tempos, by keeping time with a swing-like off-beat, while using the &quot;doo-wop&quot; syllables as a substitute for drums and a bass vocalist as a substitute for a bass instrument.

Doo-wop&#x27;s characteristic vocal style was influenced by groups such as the Mills Brothers, whose close four-part harmony derived from the vocal harmonies of the earlier barbershop quartet.

The Four Knights&#x27; &quot;Take Me Right Back to the Track&quot; (1945), the Cats and the Fiddle&#x27;s song &quot;I Miss You So&quot; (1939), and the Triangle Quartette&#x27;s even earlier record &quot;Doodlin&#x27; Back&quot; (1929) prefigured doo-wop&#x27;s rhythm and blues sound long before doo-wop became popular.

===Elements of doo-wop vocal style===
In &quot;The Complete Book of Doo-Wop&quot;, co-authors Gribin and Schiff (who also wrote &quot;Doo-Wop, the Forgotten Third of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;), identify five features of doo-wop music:
# it is vocal music made by groups;
# it features a wide range of vocal parts, &quot;usually from bass to falsetto&quot;;
# it includes nonsense syllables;
# there is a simple beat and low key instrumentals; and
# it has simple words and music.
While these features provide a helpful guide, they need not all be present in a given song for aficionados to consider it doo-wop, and the list does not include the aforementioned typical doo-wop chord progressions. Bill Kenny, lead singer of the Ink Spots, is often credited with introducing the &quot;top and bottom&quot; vocal arrangement featuring a high tenor singing the intro and a bass spoken chorus. The Mills Brothers, who were famous in part because in their vocals they sometimes mimicked instruments, were an additional influence on street vocal harmony groups, who, singing &quot;a cappella&quot; arrangements, used wordless onomatopoeia to mimic musical instruments. For instance, &quot;Count Every Star&quot; by the Ravens (1950) includes vocalizations imitating the &quot;doomph, doomph&quot; plucking of a double bass. The Orioles helped develop the doo-wop sound with their hits &quot;It&#x27;s Too Soon to Know&quot; (1948) and &quot;Crying in the Chapel&quot; (1953).

===Origin of the name===
Although the musical style originated in the late 1940s and was very popular in the 1950s, the term &quot;doo-wop&quot; itself did not appear in print until 1961, when it was used in reference to the Marcels&#x27; song, &quot;Blue Moon&quot;, in &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot;, just as the style&#x27;s vogue was nearing its end. Though the name was attributed to radio disc jockey Gus Gossert, he did not accept credit, stating that &quot;doo-wop&quot; was already in use in California to categorize the music.

&quot;Doo-wop&quot; is itself a nonsense expression. In the Delta Rhythm Boys&#x27; 1945 recording, &quot;Just A-Sittin&#x27; And A-Rockin&quot;, it is heard in the backing vocal. It is heard later in the Clovers&#x27; 1953 release &quot;Good Lovin&#x27;&quot; (Atlantic Records 1000), and in the chorus of Carlyle Dundee &amp; the Dundees&#x27; 1954 song &quot;Never&quot; (Space Records 201). The first hit record with &quot;doo-wop&quot; being harmonized in the refrain was the Turbans&#x27; 1955 hit, &quot;When You Dance&quot; (Herald Records H-458). The Rainbows embellished the phrase as &quot;do wop de wadda&quot; in their 1955 &quot;Mary Lee&quot; (on Red Robin Records; also a Washington, D.C. regional hit on Pilgrim 703); and in their 1956 national hit, &quot;In the Still of the Night&quot;, the Five Satins sang across the bridge with a plaintive &quot;doo-wop, doo-wah&quot;.

==Development==

The vocal harmony group tradition that developed in the United States after World War II was the most popular form of rhythm and blues music among black teenagers, especially those living in the large urban centers of the East Coast, in Chicago, and in Detroit. Among the first groups to perform songs in the vocal harmony group tradition were the Orioles, the Five Keys, and the Spaniels; they specialized in romantic ballads that appealed to the sexual fantasies of teenagers in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The nonsense string of syllables, &quot;doo doo doo doo-wop&quot;, from which the name of the genre was later derived, is used repeatedly in the song &quot;Just A Sittin&#x27; And A Rockin&quot;, recorded by the Delta Rhythm Boys in December 1945. By the mid-1950s, vocal harmony groups had transformed the smooth delivery of ballads into a performance style incorporating the nonsense phrase as vocalized by the bass singers, who provided rhythmic movement for &quot;a cappella&quot; songs. Soon, other doo-wop groups entered the pop charts, particularly in 1955, which saw such cross-over doo-wop hits as &quot;Sincerely&quot; by the Moonglows, &quot;Earth Angel&quot; by the Penguins, the Cadillacs&#x27; &quot;Gloria&quot;, the Heartbeats&#x27; &quot;A Thousand Miles Away&quot;, Shep &amp; the Limelites&#x27; &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home&quot;, the Flamingos&#x27; &quot;I Only Have Eyes for You&quot;, and the Jive Five &quot;My True Story&quot;.

Teenagers who could not afford musical instruments formed groups that sang songs &quot;a cappella&quot; at high school dances and other social occasions. They rehearsed on street corners and apartment stoops, as well as under bridges, in high school washrooms, and in hallways and other places with echoes: these were the only spaces with suitable acoustics available to them. Thus they developed a form of group harmony based in the harmonies and emotive phrasing of black spirituals and gospel music. Doo-wop music allowed these youths not only a means of entertaining themselves and others, but also a way of expressing their values and worldviews in a repressive white-dominated society, often through the use of innuendo and hidden messages in the lyrics.

Particularly productive doo-wop groups were formed by young Italian-American men who, like their black counterparts, lived in rough neighborhoods (e.g., the Bronx and Brooklyn), learned their basic musical craft singing in church, and would gain experience in the new style by singing on street corners. New York was the capital of Italian doo-wop, and all its boroughs were home to groups that made successful records.

By the late 1950s and early 1960s, many Italian-American groups had national hits: Dion and the Belmonts scored with &quot;I Wonder Why&quot;, &quot;Teenager in Love&quot;, and &quot;Where or When&quot;; the Capris made their name in 1960 with &quot;There&#x27;s a Moon Out Tonight&quot;; Randy &amp; the Rainbows, who charted with their Top 10 1963 single &quot;Denise&quot;. Other Italian-American doo-wop groups were the Earls, the Chimes, the Elegants, the Mystics, the Duprees, Johnny Maestro &amp; the Crests, and the Regents.
Some doo-wop groups were racially mixed. Puerto Rican Herman Santiago, originally slated to be the lead singer of the Teenagers, wrote the lyrics and the music for a song to be called &quot;Why Do Birds Sing So Gay?&quot;, but whether because he was ill or because producer George Goldner thought that newcomer Frankie Lymon&#x27;s voice would be better in the lead, Santiago&#x27;s original version was not recorded. To suit his tenor voice Lymon made a few alterations to the melody, and consequently the Teenagers recorded the song known as &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love?&quot;. Racially integrated groups with both black and white performers included the Del-Vikings, who had major hits in 1957 with &quot;Come Go With Me&quot; and &quot;Whispering Bells&quot;, the Crests, whose &quot;16 Candles&quot; appeared in 1958, and the Impalas, whose &quot;Sorry (I Ran All the Way Home)&quot; was a hit in 1959. Chico Torres was a member of the Crests, whose lead singer, Johhny Mastrangelo, would later gain fame under the name Johnny Maestro.

Female doo-wop singers were much less common than males in the early days of doo-wop. Lillian Leach, lead singer of the Mellows from 1953 to 1958, helped pave the way for other women in doo-wop, soul and R&amp;B. Margo Sylvia was the lead singer for the Tune Weavers.

===Baltimore===

Like other urban centers in the US during the late 1940s and early 1950s, Baltimore developed its own vocal group tradition. The city produced rhythm and blues innovators such as the Cardinals, the Orioles, and the Swallows. The Royal Theatre in Baltimore and the Howard in Washington, D.C. were among the most prestigious venues for black performers on the so-called &quot;Chitlin Circuit&quot;, which served as a school of the performing arts for blacks who had migrated from the deep South, and even more so for their offspring. In the late 1940s, the Orioles rose from the streets and made a profound impression on young chitlin&#x27; circuit audiences in Baltimore. The group, formed in 1947, sang simple ballads in rhythm and blues harmony, with the standard arrangement of a high tenor singing over the chords of the blended mid-range voices and a strong bass voice. Their lead singer, Sonny Til, had a soft, high-pitched tenor, and like the rest of the group, was still a teenager at the time. His style reflected the optimism of young black Americans in the postmigration era. The sound they helped develop, later called &#x27;&quot;doo-wop&quot;, eventually became a &quot;sonic bridge&quot; to reach a white teen audience.

In 1948, Jubilee Records signed the Orioles to a contract, following which they appeared on Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s &quot;Talent Scout&quot; radio show. The song they performed, &quot;It&#x27;s Too Soon to Know&quot;, often cited as the first doo-wop song, went to number 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Race Records&quot; chart, and number 13 on the pop charts, a crossover first for a black group. This was followed in 1953 by &quot;Crying in the Chapel&quot;, their biggest hit, which went to number 1 on the R&amp;B chart and number 11 on the pop chart. The Orioles were perhaps the first of the many doo-wop groups who named themselves after birds.

The sexual innuendo in the Orioles&#x27; songs was less disguised than in the vocal group music of the swing era. Their stage choreography was also more sexually explicit, and their songs were simpler and more emotionally direct. This new approach to sex in their performances did not target the white teen audience at first—when the Orioles took the stage, they were appealing directly to a young black audience, with Sonny Til using his entire body to convey the emotion in the lyrics of their songs. He became a teen sex symbol for black girls, who reacted by screaming and throwing pieces of clothing onto the stage when he sang. Other young male vocalists of the era took note and adjusted their own acts accordingly. The Orioles were soon displaced by newer groups who imitated these pioneers as a model for success.

The Swallows began in the late 1940s as a group of Baltimore teenagers calling themselves the Oakaleers. One of the members lived across the street from Sonny Til, who went on to lead the Orioles, and their success inspired the Oakaleers to rename themselves the Swallows. Their song &quot;Will You Be Mine&quot;, released in 1951, reached number 9 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. In 1952, the Swallows released &quot;Beside You&quot;, their second national hit, which peaked at number 10 on the R&amp;B chart.

Some Baltimore doo-wop groups were connected with street gangs, and a few members were active in both scenes, such as Johnny Page of the Marylanders. As in all the major urban centers of the US, many of the teen gangs had their own street corner vocal groups in which they took great pride and which they supported fiercely. Competitive music and dance was a part of African American street culture, and with the success of some local groups, competition increased, leading to territorial rivalries among performers. Pennsylvania Avenue served as a boundary between East and West Baltimore, with the East producing the Swallows and the Cardinals and the Blentones, while the West was home to the Orioles and the Four Buddies.

Baltimore vocal groups gathered at neighborhood record stores, where they practiced the latest hits in hopes that the store owners&#x27; connections with record companies and distributors might land them an audition. A King Records talent scout discovered the Swallows as they were rehearsing in Goldstick&#x27;s record store. Sam Azrael&#x27;s Super Music Store and Shaw&#x27;s shoeshine parlor were also favored hangouts for Baltimore vocal groups; Jerry Wexler and Ahmet Ertegun auditioned the Cardinals at Azrael&#x27;s. Some groups cut demos at local studios and played them for recording producers, with the aim of getting signed to a record deal.

===Chicago===

The city of Chicago was outranked as a recording center in the United States only by New York City in the early years of the music recording industry. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, independent record labels gained control of the black record market from the major companies, and Chicago rose as one of the main centers for rhythm and blues music. This music was a vital source for the youth music called rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. In the mid-1950s, a number of rhythm and blues acts performing in the vocal ensemble style later known as &quot;doo-wop&quot; began to cross over from the R&amp;B charts to mainstream rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. The Chicago record companies took note of this trend and scouted for vocal groups from the city that they could sign to their labels. The record labels, record distributors, and nightclub owners of Chicago all had a part in developing the vocal potential of the doo-wop groups, but Chicago doo-wop was &quot;created and nourished&quot; on the street corners of the city&#x27;s lower-class neighborhoods.

The Chicago doo-wop groups, like those in New York, started singing on street corners and practiced their harmonies in tiled bathrooms, hallways, and subways; however, because they came originally from the deep South, the home of gospel and blues music, their doo-wop sound was more influenced by gospel and blues.

Vee-Jay Records and Chess Records were the main labels recording doo-wop groups in Chicago. Vee-Jay signed the Dells, the El Dorados, the Magnificents, and the Spaniels, all of whom achieved national chart hits in the mid-1950s. Chess signed the Moonglows, who had the most commercial success (seven Top 40 R&amp;B hits, six of those Top Ten) of the 1950s doo-wop groups, and the Flamingos, who had national hits as well.

===Detroit===
In 1945, Joe Von Battle opened Joe&#x27;s Record Shop at 3530 Hastings Street in Detroit; the store had the largest selection of rhythm and blues records in the city, according to a 1954 &quot;Billboard&quot; business survey. Battle, a migrant from Macon, Georgia, established his shop as the first black-owned business in the area, which remained primarily Jewish up to the late 1940s. Young aspiring performers would gather there in hopes of being discovered by the leading independent record company owners who courted Battle to promote and sell records, as well as to find new talent at his shop and studio. Battle&#x27;s record labels included JVB, Von, Battle, Gone, and Viceroy; he also had subsidiary arrangements with labels such as King and Deluxe. He supplied Syd Nathan with many blues and doo-wop masters recorded in his primitive back-of-the-store studio from 1948 to 1954. As the pivotal recording mogul in the Detroit area, Battle was an important player in the independent label network.

Jack and Devora Brown, a Jewish couple, founded Fortune Records in 1946 and recorded a variety of eccentric artists and sounds; in the mid-1950s they became champions of Detroit rhythm and blues, including the music of local doo-wop groups. Fortune&#x27;s premier act was the Diablos, featuring the soaring tenor of lead vocalist Nolan Strong, a native of Alabama. The group&#x27;s most notable hit was &quot;The Wind&quot;. Strong, like other R&amp;B and doo-wop tenors of the time, was profoundly influenced by Clyde McPhatter, lead singer of the Dominoes and later of the Drifters. Strong himself made a lasting impression on the young Smokey Robinson, who went out of his way to attend Diablo shows.

In late 1957, 17-year-old Robinson, fronting a Detroit vocal harmony group called the Matadors, met the producer Berry Gordy, who was beginning to take up new styles, including doo-wop. Gordy wanted to promote a black style of music that would appeal to both the black and white markets, performed by black musicians with roots in gospel, R&amp;B, or doo-wop. He sought artists who understood that the music had to be updated to appeal to a broader audience and attain greater commercial success. Early recordings by Gordy&#x27;s Tamla Records, founded several months before he established the Motown Record Corporation in January 1959, were of either blues or doo-wop performances.

&quot;Bad Girl&quot;, a 1959 doo-wop single by Robinson&#x27;s group, the Miracles, was the first single released (and the only one released by this group) on the Motown label—all previous singles from the company (and all those following from the group) were released on the Tamla label. Issued locally on the Motown Records label, it was licensed to and released nationally by Chess Records because the fledgling Motown Record Corporation did not, at that time, have national distribution. &quot;Bad Girl&quot; was the group&#x27;s first national chart hit, reaching number 93 on the Billboard Hot 100. Written by Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson and Motown Records&#x27; president Berry Gordy, &quot;Bad Girl&quot; was the first of several of the Miracles&#x27; songs performed in the doo-wop style during the late 1950s.

===Los Angeles===

Doo-wop groups also formed on the west coast of the United States, especially in California, where the scene was centered in Los Angeles. Independent record labels owned by black entrepreneurs such as Dootsie Williams and John Dolphin recorded these groups, most of which had formed in high schools. One such group, the Penguins, included Cleveland &quot;Cleve&quot; Duncan and Dexter Tisby, former classmates at Fremont High School in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles. They, along with Bruce Tate and Curtis Williams, recorded the song &quot;Earth Angel&quot; (produced by Dootsie Williams), which rose to number one on the R&amp;B charts in 1954.

Most of the Los Angeles doo-wop groups came out of the Fremont, Belmont, and Jefferson high schools. All of them were influenced by the Robins, a successful R&amp;B group of the late 1940s and the 1950s who formed in San Francisco, or by other groups including the Flairs, the Flamingos (not the Chicago group) and the Hollywood Flames. Many other Los Angeles doo-wop groups of the time were recorded by Dootsie Williams&#x27; Dootone Records and by John Dolphin&#x27;s Central Avenue record store, Dolphin&#x27;s of Hollywood. These included the Calvanes, the Crescendos, the Cuff Linx, the Cubans, the Dootones, the Jaguars, the Jewels, the Meadowlarks, the Silks, the Squires, the Titans, and the Up-Fronts. A few groups, such as the Platters and Rex Middleton&#x27;s Hi-Fis, had crossover success.

The Jaguars, from Fremont High School, was one of the first interracial vocal groups; it consisted of two African Americans, a Mexican American, and a Polish-Italian American. Doo-wop was popular with California Mexican Americans, who were attracted in the 1950s to its &quot;a capella&quot; vocals; the romantic style of the doo-wop groups appealed to them, as it was reminiscent of the traditional ballads and harmonies of Mexican folk music.

In 1960, Art Laboe released one of the first oldies compilations, &quot;Memories of El Monte&quot;, on his record label, Original Sound. The record was a collection of classic doo-wop songs by bands that used to play at the dances Laboe organized at Legion Stadium in El Monte, California, beginning in 1955. It included songs by local bands such as the Heartbeats and the Medallions. Laboe had become a celebrity in the Los Angeles area as a disc jockey for radio station KPOP, playing doo-wop and rhythm and blues broadcast from the parking lot of Scriverner&#x27;s Drive-In on Sunset Boulevard.

In 1962, Frank Zappa, with his friend Ray Collins, wrote the doo-wop song &quot;Memories of El Monte&quot;. This was one of the first songs written by Zappa, who had been listening to Laboe&#x27;s compilation of doo-wop singles. Zappa took the song to Laboe, who recruited the lead vocalist of the Penguins, Cleve Duncan, for a new iteration of the group, recorded it, and released it as a single on his record label.

===New York City===
Early doo-wop music, dating from the late 1940s and early 1950s, was especially popular in the Northeast industrial corridor from New York to Philadelphia, and New York City was the world capital of doo-wop. There, African American groups such as the Ravens, the Drifters, the Dominoes, the Charts, and the so-called &quot;bird groups&quot;, such as the Crows, the Sparrows, the Larks, and the Wrens, melded rhythm and blues with the gospel music they had grown up singing in church. Street singing was almost always &quot;a cappella&quot;; instrumental accompaniment was added when the songs were recorded. The large numbers of blacks who had migrated to New York City as part of the Great Migration came mostly from Georgia, Florida, and the Carolinas. In the 1940s black youths in the city began to sing the rhythm and blues styling that came to be known as doo-wop. Many of these groups were found in Harlem.

Blacks were forced by legal and social segregation, as well as by the constraints of the built environment, to live in certain parts of New York City of the early 1950s. They identified with their own wards, street blocks and streets. Being effectively locked out of mainstream white society increased their social cohesion and encouraged creativity within the context of African American culture. Young singers formed groups and rehearsed their songs in public spaces: on street corners, apartment stoops, and subway platforms, in bowling alleys, school bathrooms, and pool halls, as well as at playgrounds and under bridges.

Bobby Robinson, a native of South Carolina, was an independent record producer and songwriter in Harlem who helped popularize doo-wop music in the 1950s. He got into the music business in 1946 when he opened &quot;Bobby&#x27;s Record Shop&quot; (later &quot;Bobby&#x27;s Happy House&quot;) on the corner of 125th Street and Eighth Avenue, near the Apollo Theater, a noted venue for African-American performers. The Apollo held talent contests in which audience members indicated their favorites with applause. These were a major outlet for doo-wop performers to be discovered by record company talent scouts. In 1951, Robinson started Robin Records, which later became Red Robin Records, and began recording doo-wop; he recorded the Ravens, the Mello-Moods, and many other doo-wop vocal groups. He used the tiny shop to launch a series of record labels which released many hits in the US. Robinson founded or co-founded Red Robin Records, Whirlin&#x27; Disc Records, Fury Records, Everlast Records, Fire Records and Enjoy Records.

Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s long-running (1946–1958) morning radio show on CBS, Talent Scouts, was a New York venue from which some doo-wop groups gained national exposure. In 1948, the Orioles, then known as the Vibra-Nairs, went to the city with Deborah Chessler, their manager and main songwriter, and appeared on the show. They won only third place, but Godfrey invited them back twice. Chessler leveraged a few demo recordings the group had cut, along with the recent radio exposure, to interest a distributor in marketing the group on an independent label. They cut six sides, one of which was a doo-wop ballad written by Chessler called &quot;It&#x27;s Too Soon to Know&quot;. It reached no. 1 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; national Most-Played Juke Box Race Records chart, and, in a first for a doo-wop song, the record crossed over to the mainstream pop chart, where it reached no. 13.

The Du Droppers formed in Harlem in 1952. Members of the band were experienced gospel singers in ensembles dating to the 1940s, and were one of the oldest groups to record during the era. Among the Du Droppers&#x27; most enduring songs are &quot;I Wanna Know&quot; and &quot;I Found Out (What You Do When You Go Round There)&quot;, which both reached number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B charts in 1953.

Frankie Lymon, lead vocalist of the Teenagers, was the first black teen idol who appealed to both black and white audiences. He was born in Harlem, where he began singing doo-wop songs with his friends on the streets. He joined a group, the Premiers, and helped members Herman Santiago and Jimmy Merchant rewrite a song they had composed to create &quot;Why Do Fools Fall In Love&quot;, which won the group an audition with Gee Records. Santiago was too sick to sing lead on the day of the audition, consequently Lymon sang the lead on &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; instead, and the group was signed as the Teenagers with Lymon as lead singer. The song quickly charted as the number one R&amp;B song in the United States and reached number six on the pop chart in 1956, becoming the number one pop hit in the United Kingdom as well.

The Willows, an influential street corner group from Harlem, were a model for many of the New York City doo-wop acts that rose after them. Their biggest hit was &quot;Church Bells May Ring&quot;, featuring Neil Sedaka, then a member of the Linc-Tones, on chimes. It reached number 11 on the US R&amp;B chart in 1956.

Although they never had a national chart hit, the Solitaires, best known for their 1957 hit single &quot;Walking Along&quot;, were one of the most popular vocal groups in New York in the late 1950s.

The heyday of the girl group era began in 1957 with the success of two teen groups from the Bronx, the Chantels and the Bobbettes. The six girls in the Bobettes, aged eleven to fifteen, wrote and recorded &quot;Mr. Lee&quot;, a novelty tune about a schoolteacher that was a national hit. The Chantels were the second African-American girl group to enjoy nationwide success in the US. The group was established in the early 1950s by five students, all of them born in the Bronx, who attended the Catholic St. Anthony of Padua School in the Bronx, where they were trained to sing Gregorian Chants. Their first recording was &quot;He&#x27;s Gone&quot; (1958), which made them the first pop rock girl group to chart. Their second single, &quot;Maybe&quot; hit the charts, No. 15 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100.

In 1960, the Chiffons began as a trio of schoolmates at James Monroe High School in the Bronx. Judy Craig, fourteen years old, was the lead singer, singing with Patricia Bennett and Barbara Lee, both thirteen. In 1962, the girls met songwriter Ronnie Mack at the after-school center; Mack suggested they add Sylvia Peterson, who had sung with Little Jimmy &amp; the Tops, to the group. The group was named the Chiffons when recording and releasing their first single, &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot;. Written by Mack, it was released on the Laurie Records label in 1963. &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot; hit No. 1 in the US, selling over one million copies.

Public School 99, which sponsored evening talent shows, and Morris High School were centers of musical creativity in the Bronx during the doo-wop era. Arthur Crier, a leading figure in the doo-wop scene in the Morrissania neighborhood, was born in Harlem and raised in the Bronx; his mother was from North Carolina. Crier was a founding member of a doo-wop group called the Five Chimes, one of several different groups with that name, and sang bass with the Halos and the Mellows. Many years later he observed that there was a shift in the music sung on the streets from gospel to secular rhythm and blues between 1950 and 1952.

New York was also the capital of Italian doo-wop, and all its boroughs were home to groups that made successful records. The Crests were from the Lower East Side in Manhattan; Dion and the Belmonts, the Regents, and Nino and the Ebb Tides were from the Bronx; the Elegants from Staten Island; the Capris from Queens; the Mystics, the Neons, the Classics, and Vito &amp; the Salutations from Brooklyn.

Although Italians were a much smaller proportion of the Bronx&#x27;s population in the 1950s than Jews and the Irish, only they had significant influence as rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll singers. Young people of other ethnicities were listening to rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, but it was Italian Americans who established themselves in performing and recording the music. While relationships between Italian Americans and African Americans in the Bronx were sometimes fraught, there were many instances of collaboration between them.

Italian Americans kept African Americans out of their neighborhoods with racial boundary policing and fought against them in turf wars and gang battles, yet they adopted the popular music of African Americans, treated it as their own, and were an appreciative audience for black doo-wop groups. Similarities in language idioms, masculine norms, and public comportment made it possible for African American and Italian American young men to mingle easily when societal expectations did not interfere. These cultural commonalities allowed Italian Americans to appreciate the singing of black doo-woppers in deterritorialized spaces, whether on the radio, on records, at live concerts, or in street performances. Dozens of neighborhood Italian groups formed, some of which recorded songs at Cousins Records, a record shop turned label, on Fordham Road. Italian American groups from the Bronx released a steady stream of doo-wop songs, including &quot;Teenager In Love&quot; and &quot;I Wonder Why&quot; by Dion and the Belmonts, and &quot;Barbara Ann&quot; by the Regents. Johnny Maestro, the Italian American lead singer of the interracial Bronx group the Crests, was the lead on the hit &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;. Maestro said that he became interested in R&amp;B vocal group harmony listening to the Flamingos, the Harptones, and the Moonglows on Alan Freed&#x27;s radio show on WINS in New York. Freed&#x27;s various radio and stage shows had a crucial role in creating a market for Italian doo-wop.

===Philadelphia===

Young black singers in Philadelphia helped create the doo-wop vocal harmony style developing in the major cities of the US during the 1950s. Early doo-wop groups in the city included the Castelles, the Silhouettes, the Turbans, and Lee Andrews &amp; the Hearts. They were recorded by small independent rhythm and blues record labels, and occasionally by more established labels in New York. Most of these groups had limited success, scoring only one or two hit songs on the R&amp;B charts. They had frequent personnel changes and often moved from label to label hoping to achieve another hit.

The migration of blacks to Philadelphia from the southern states of the US, especially South Carolina and Virginia, had a profound effect not only on the city&#x27;s demographics, but on its music and culture as well. During the Great Migration, the black population of Philadelphia increased to 250,000 by 1940. Hundreds of thousands of southern African Americans migrated to the metropolitan area, bringing their secular and religious folk music with them. After World War II, the black population of the metro grew to about 530,000 by 1960.

Black doo-wop groups had a major role in the evolution of rhythm and blues in early 1950s Philadelphia. Groups like the Castelles and the Turbans helped develop the music with their tight harmonies, lush ballads, and distinctive falsettos. Many of these vocal groups got together in secondary schools such as West Philadelphia High School, and performed at neighborhood recreation centers and teen dances. The Turbans, Philadelphia&#x27;s first nationally charting R&amp;B group, formed in 1953 when they were in their teens. They signed with Herald Records and recorded &quot;Let Me Show You (Around My Heart)&quot; with its B side, &quot;When We Dance&quot;, in 1955. &quot;When We Dance&quot; became a national hit,
rising to no. 3 on the R&amp;B charts and reaching the Top 40 on the pop charts.

The Silhouettes&#x27; crossover hit &quot;Get a Job&quot;, released in 1957, reached number one on the pop and R&amp;B charts in February 1958, while Lee Andrews &amp; the Hearts had hits in 1957 and 1958 with &quot;Teardrops&quot;, &quot;Long Lonely Nights&quot;, and &quot;Try the Impossible&quot;.

Kae Williams, a Philadelphia deejay, record label owner and producer, managed the doo-wop groups Lee Andrews &amp; the Hearts, the Sensations, who sold nearly a million records in 1961 with the song &quot;Let Me In&quot;, and the Silhouettes, who had a number 1 hit in 1958 with &quot;Get a Job&quot;. After the nationally distributed Ember label acquired the rights to &quot;Get a Job&quot;, Dick Clark began to play it on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, and subsequently it sold over a million copies, topping the Billboard R&amp;B singles chart and pop singles chart.

Although &quot;American Bandstand&quot;&#x27;s programming came to rely on the musical creations of black performers, the show marginalized black teens with exclusionary admissions policies until it moved to Los Angeles in 1964. Featuring young whites dancing to music popularized by local deejays Georgie Woods and Mitch Thomas, with steps created by their black teenage listeners, &quot;Bandstand&quot; presented to its national audience an image of youth culture that erased the presence of black teenagers in Philadelphia&#x27;s youth music scene.

Broadcast from a warehouse on 46th and Market Street in West Philadelphia, most of &quot;American Bandstand&quot;&#x27;s young dancers were Italian Americans who attended a nearby Catholic high school in South Philadelphia. Like the rest of the entertainment industry, &quot;American Bandstand&quot; camouflaged the intrinsic blackness of the music in response to a national moral panic over rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&#x27;s popularity with white teenagers, and the show&#x27;s Italian American dancers and performers were deethnicized as &quot;nice white kids&quot;, their Italian American youth identity submerged in whiteness.

Dick Clark kept track of the national music scene through promoters and popular disc jockeys. In Philadelphia, he listened to Hy Lit, the lone white deejay at WHAT, and African American disc jockeys Georgie Woods and Douglas &quot;Jocko&quot; Henderson on WDAS. These were Philadelphia&#x27;s two major black radio stations; they were black-oriented, but white-owned.

The program director of WHAT, Charlie O&#x27;Donnell, hired Lit, who was Jewish, to deejay on the station in 1955, and Lit&#x27;s career was launched. From there he went to WRCV and then around 1956 to WIBG, where over 70 percent of the radio audience in the listening area tuned in to his 6–10 p.m. program.

Cameo Records and Parkway Records were major record labels based in Philadelphia from 1956 (Cameo) and 1958 (Parkway) to 1967 that released doo-wop records. In 1957, small Philadelphia record label XYZ had recorded &quot;Silhouettes&quot;, a song by local group the Rays, which Cameo picked up for national distribution. It eventually reached number 3 on both the R&amp;B Best Sellers chart and Billboard Top 100, and also reached the top five on both the sales and airplay charts. It was the group&#x27;s only top 40 hit.

Several white Philadelphia doo-wop groups also had chart-toppers; the Capris had a regional hit with &quot;God Only Knows&quot; in 1954. In 1958, Danny &amp; the Juniors had a number-one hit with &quot;At the Hop&quot; and their song &quot;Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay&quot; reached the top twenty. In 1961, the Dovells reached the number two spot with &quot;Bristol Stomp&quot;, about teenagers in Bristol, Pennsylvania who were dancing a new step called &quot;The Stomp&quot;.

Jerry Blavat, a half-Jewish, half-Italian, popular deejay on Philadelphia radio, built his career hosting dances and live shows and gained a devoted local following.
He soon had his own independent radio show, on which he introduced many doo-wop acts in the 1960s to a wide audience, including the Four Seasons, an Italian American group from Newark, New Jersey.

===Jamaica===
The history of modern Jamaican music is relatively short. A sudden shift in its style began in the early 1950s with the importing of American rhythm and blues records to the island and the new availability of affordable transistor radios. Listeners whose tastes had been neglected by the lone Jamaican station at the time, RJR (Real Jamaican Radio), tuned into the R&amp;B music being broadcast on the powerful nighttime signals of American AM radio stations, especially WLAC in Nashville, WNOE in New Orleans, and WINZ in Miami. On these stations Jamaicans could hear the likes of Fats Domino and doo-wop vocal groups.

Jamaicans who worked as migrant agricultural workers in the southern US returned with R&amp;B records, which sparked an active dance scene in Kingston. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, many working-class Jamaicans who could not afford radios attended sound system dances, large outdoor dances featuring a deejay (selector) and his selection of records. Enterprising deejays used mobile sound systems to create impromptu street parties. These developments were the principal means by which new American R&amp;B records were introduced to a mass Jamaican audience.

The opening by Ken Khouri of Federal Studios, Jamaica&#x27;s first recording facility, in 1954, marked the beginning of a prolific recording industry and a thriving rhythm and blues scene in Jamaica. In 1957, American performers including Rosco Gordon and the Platters performed in Kingston. In late August 1957, the doo-wop group Lewis Lymon and the Teenchords arrived in Kingston as part of the &quot;Rock-a-rama&quot; rhythm and blues troupe for two days of shows at the Carib Theatre.
The Four Coins, a Greek American doo-wop group from Pittsburgh, did a show in Kingston in 1958.

Like their American exemplars, many Jamaican vocalists began their careers by practicing harmonies in groups on street corners, before moving on to the talent contest circuit that was the for new talent in the days before the rise of the first sound systems.

In 1959, while he was a student at Kingston College, Dobby Dobson wrote the doo-wop song &quot;Cry a Little Cry&quot; in honor of his shapely biology teacher, and recruited a group of his schoolmates to back him on a recording of the song under the name Dobby Dobson and the Deltas on the Tip-Top label. It climbed to number one on the RJR charts, where it spent some six weeks.

The harmonizing of the American doo-wop groups the Drifters and the Impressions served as a vocal model for a newly formed (1963) group, the Wailers, in which Bob Marley sang lead while Bunny Wailer sang high harmony and Peter Tosh sang low harmony. The Wailers recorded an homage to doo-wop in 1965 with their version of Dion and the Belmonts&#x27; &quot;A Teenager in Love&quot;. Bunny Wailer cited Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, the Platters, and the Drifters as early influences on the group. The Wailers covered Harvey and the Moonglows&#x27; 1958 doo-wop hit, &quot;Ten Commandments of Love&quot;, on their debut album, &quot;Wailing Wailers&quot;, released in late 1965. The same year, the Wailers cut the doo-wop song &quot;Lonesome Feelings&quot;, with &quot;There She Goes&quot; on the B-side, as a single produced by Coxsone Dodd.

==Doo-wop and racial relations==
The synthesis of music styles that evolved into what is now called rhythm and blues, previously labeled &quot;race music&quot; by the record companies, found a broad youth audience in the postwar years and helped to catalyze changes in racial relations in American society. By 1948, RCA Victor was marketing black music under the name &quot;Blues and Rhythm&quot;. In 1949, Jerry Wexler, a reporter for &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine at the time, reversed the words and coined the name &quot;Rhythm and Blues&quot; to replace the term &quot;Race Music&quot; for the magazine&#x27;s black music chart.

One style of rhythm and blues was mostly vocal, with instrumental backing that ranged from a full orchestra to none. It was most often performed by a group, frequently a quartet, as in the black gospel tradition; utilizing close harmonies, this style was nearly always performed in a slow to medium tempo. The lead voice, usually one in the upper register, often sang over the driving, wordless chords of the other singers or interacted with them in a call-and-response exchange. Vocal harmony groups such as the Ink Spots embodied this style, the direct antecedent of doo-wop, which rose from inner city street corners in the mid-1950s and ranked high on the popular music charts between 1955 and 1959.

Black and white young people both wanted to see popular doo-wop acts perform, and racially mixed groups of youths would stand on inner city street corners and sing doo-wop songs &quot;a capella&quot;. This angered white supremacists, who considered rhythm and blues and rock and roll a danger to America&#x27;s youth.

The development of rhythm and blues coincided with the issue of racial segregation becoming more socially contentious in American society, while the black leadership increasingly challenged the old social order. The white power structure in American society and some executives in the corporately controlled entertainment industry saw rhythm and blues, rooted in black culture, as obscene, and considered it a threat to white youth, among whom the genre was becoming increasingly popular.

==Jewish influence in doo-wop==

Jewish composers, musicians, and promoters had a prominent role in the transition to doo-wop and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll from jazz and swing in American popular music of the 1950s, while Jewish businessmen founded many of the labels that recorded rhythm and blues during the height of the vocal group era.

In the decade from 1944 to 1955, many of the most influential record companies specializing in &quot;race&quot; musicor &quot;rhythm and blues&quot;, as it later came to be knownwere owned or co-owned by Jews. It was the small independent record companies that recorded, marketed, and distributed doo-wop music. For example, Jack and Devora Brown, a Jewish couple in Detroit, founded Fortune Records in 1946, and recorded a variety of eccentric artists and sounds; in the mid-1950s they became champions of Detroit rhythm and blues, including the music of local doo-wop groups.

A few other Jewish women were in the recording business, such as Florence Greenberg, who started the Scepter label in 1959, and signed the African American girl group, the Shirelles. The songwriting team of Goffin and King, who worked for Don Kirshner&#x27;s Aldon music at 1650 Broadway (near the famed Brill Building at 1619), offered Greenberg a song, &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot;, which was recorded by the Shirelles and rose to number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in 1961. During the early 1960s, Scepter was the most successful independent record label.

Deborah Chessler, a young Jewish sales clerk interested in black music, became the manager and songwriter for the Baltimore doo-wop group the Orioles. They recorded her song &quot;It&#x27;s Too Soon to Know&quot; and it reached no. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s race records charts in November 1948.

Some record company owners such as Herman Lubinsky had a reputation for exploiting black artists. Lubinsky, who founded Savoy Records in 1942, produced and recorded the Carnations, the Debutantes, the Falcons, the Jive Bombers, the Robins, and many others. Although his entrepreneurial approach to the music business and his role as a middleman between black artists and white audiences created opportunities for unrecorded groups to pursue wider exposure, he was reviled by many of the black musicians he dealt with. Historians Robert Cherry and Jennifer Griffith maintain that regardless of Lubinsky&#x27;s personal shortcomings, the evidence that he treated African American artists worse in his business dealings than other independent label owners did is unconvincing. They contend that in the extremely competitive independent record company business during the postwar era, the practices of Jewish record owners generally were more a reflection of changing economic realities in the industry than of their personal attitudes.

New York rockers Lou Reed, Joey and Tommy Ramone, and Chris Stein were doo-wop fans, as were many other Jewish punks and proto-punks. Reed recorded his first lead vocals in 1962 on two doo-wop songs, &quot;Merry Go Round&quot; and &quot;Your Love&quot;, which were not released at the time. A few years later, Reed worked as a staff songwriter writing bubblegum and doo-wop songs in the assembly-line operation at Pickwick Records in New York.

==Doo-wop influence on punk and proto-punk rockers==
The R&amp;B and doo-wop music that informed early rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll was racially appropriated in the 1970s just as blues-based rock had been in the 1950s and 1960s. Generic terms such as &quot;Brill Building music&quot; obscure the roles of the black producers, writers, and groups like the Marvelettes and the Supremes, who were performing similar music and creating hits for the Motown label, but were categorized as soul. According to ethnomusicologist Evan Rapport, before 1958 more than ninety percent of doo-wop performers were African-American, but the situation changed as large numbers of white groups began to enter the performance arena.
This music was embraced by punk rockers in the 1970s, as part of a larger societal trend among white people in the US of romanticizing it as music that belonged to a simpler (in their eyes) time of racial harmony before the social upheaval of the 1960s. White Americans had a nostalgic fascination with the 1950s and early 1960s that entered mainstream culture beginning in 1969 when Gus Gossert started to broadcast early rock and roll and doo-wop songs on New York&#x27;s WCBS-FM radio station. This trend reached its peak in racially segregated commercial productions such as &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, &quot;Happy Days&quot;, and &quot;Grease&quot;, which was double-billed with the Ramones&#x27; B-movie feature &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot; in 1979.

Early punk rock adaptations of the 12-bar &quot;aab&quot; pattern associated with California surf or beach music, done within eight-, sixteen-, and twenty-four bar forms, were made by bands such as the Ramones, either as covers or as original compositions. Employing stylistic conventions of 1950s and 1960s doowop and rock and roll to signify the period referenced, some punk bands used call-and-response background vocals and doo-wop style vocables in songs, with subject matter following the example set by rock and roll and doo-wop groups of that era: teenage romance, cars, and dancing. Early punk rockers sometimes portrayed these nostalgic 1950s tropes with irony and sarcasm according to their own lived experiences, but they still indulged the fantasies evoked by the images.

By 1963 and 1964, proto-punk rocker Lou Reed was working the college circuit, leading bands that played covers of three-chord hits by pop groups and &quot;anything from New York with a classic doo-wop feel and a street attitude&quot;.

Jonathan Richman, founder of the influential proto-punk band the Modern Lovers, cut the album &quot;Rockin&#x27; and Romance&quot; (1985) with acoustic guitar and doo-wop harmonies. His song &quot;Down in Bermuda&quot; for example, was directly influenced by &quot;Down in Cuba&quot; by the Royal Holidays. His album &quot;Modern Lovers 88&quot; (1987), with doo-wop stylings and Bo Diddley rhythms, was recorded in acoustic trio format.

==Popularity==

Doo-wop groups achieved 1951 R&amp;B chart hits with songs such as &quot;Sixty Minute Man&quot; by Billy Ward and His Dominoes, &quot;Where Are You?&quot; by the Mello-Moods, &quot;The Glory of Love&quot; by the Five Keys, and &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t I Know&quot; by the Cardinals.

Doo-wop groups played a significant role in ushering in the rock and roll era when two big rhythm and blues hits by vocal harmony groups, &quot;Gee&quot; by the Crows, and &quot;Sh-Boom&quot; by the Chords, crossed over onto the pop music charts in 1954. &quot;Sh-Boom&quot; is considered to have been the first rhythm-and-blues record to break into the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, reaching number 5; a few months later, a white group from Canada, the Crew Cuts, released their cover of the song, which reached number 1 and remained there for nine weeks. This was followed by several other white artists covering doo-wop songs performed by black artists, all of which scored higher on the Billboard charts than did the originals. These include &quot;Hearts of Stone&quot; by the Fontaine Sisters (number 1), &quot;At My Front Door&quot; by Pat Boone (number 7), &quot;Sincerely&quot; by the McGuire Sisters (number 1), and &quot;Little Darlin&#x27;&quot; by the Diamonds (number 2). Music historian Billy Vera points out that these recordings are not considered to be doo-wop.

&quot;Only You&quot; was released in June 1955 by pop group the Platters. That same year the Platters had a number one pop chart hit with &quot;The Great Pretender&quot;, released on 3 November. In 1956, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers appeared on the Frankie Laine show in New York, which was televised nationally, performing their hit &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love?&quot;. Frankie Laine referred to it as &quot;rock and roll&quot;; Lymon&#x27;s extreme youth appealed to a young and enthusiastic audience. His string of hits included: &quot;I Promise to Remember&quot;, &quot;The ABC&#x27;s of Love&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Juvenile Delinquent&quot;.

Up tempo doo-wop groups such as the Monotones&quot;, the Silhouettes, and the Marcels had hits that charted on Billboard. All-white doo-wop groups would appear and also produce hits: The Mello-Kings in 1957 with &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot;, the Diamonds in 1957 with the chart-topping cover song &quot;Little Darlin&#x27;&quot; (original song by an African American group), the Skyliners in 1959 with &quot;Since I Don&#x27;t Have You&quot;, the Tokens in 1961 with &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot;.

The peak of doo-wop might have been in the late 1950s; in the early 1960s the most notable hits were Dion&#x27;s &quot;Runaround Sue&quot;, &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, &quot;Lovers Who Wander&quot; and &quot;Ruby Baby&quot; and the Marcels&#x27; &quot;Blue Moon&quot;. There was a revival of the nonsense syllable form of doo-wop in the early 1960s, with popular records by the Marcels, the Rivingtons, and Vito &amp; the Salutations. The genre reached the self-referential stage, with songs about the singers (&quot;Mr. Bass Man&quot; by Johnny Cymbal) and the songwriters (&quot;Who Put the Bomp?&quot; by Barry Mann), in 1961.

==Doo-wop&#x27;s influence==
Other pop R&amp;B groups, including the Coasters, the Drifters, the Midnighters, and the Platters, helped link the doo-wop style to the mainstream, and to the future sound of soul music. The style&#x27;s influence is heard in the music of the Miracles, particularly in their early hits such as &quot;Got A Job&quot; (an answer song to &quot;Get a Job&quot;), &quot;Bad Girl&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Loving You&quot;, &quot;(You Can) Depend on Me&quot;, and &quot;Ooo Baby Baby&quot;. Doo-wop was a precursor to many of the African-American musical styles seen today. Having evolved from pop, jazz and blues, doo-wop influenced many of the major rock and roll groups that defined the latter decades of the 20th century, and laid the foundation for many later musical innovations.

Doo-wop&#x27;s influence continued in soul, pop, and rock groups of the 1960s, including the Four Seasons, girl groups, and vocal surf music performers such as the Beach Boys. In the Beach Boys&#x27; case, doo-wop influence is evident in the chord progression used on part of their early hit &quot;Surfer Girl&quot;. The Beach Boys later acknowledged their debt to doo-wop by covering the Regents&#x27; 1961 number 7 hit, &quot;Barbara Ann&quot; with their number 2 cover of the song in 1966. In 1984, Billy Joel released &quot;The Longest Time&quot;, a clear tribute to doo-wop music.

== Revivals ==
Although the ultimate longevity of doo-wop has been disputed, the genre saw revivals at various times from the 1970s through the 1990s; the artists reviving the scene were concentrated in urban areas, mainly in New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, Newark, and Los Angeles. Revival television shows and boxed CD sets such as the &quot;Doo Wop Box&quot; set 1–3 have rekindled interest in the music, the artists, and their stories.

&quot;Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets&quot;, released in late 1968, is a concept album of doo-wop music recorded by Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention performing as a fictitious Chicano doo-wop band called Ruben &amp; the Jets. In collaboration with Zappa, singer Ruben Guevara went on to start a real band called Ruben and the Jets. An early notable revival of &quot;pure&quot; doo-wop occurred when Sha Na Na appeared at the Woodstock Festival. Soul group the Trammps recorded &quot;Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart&quot; in 1972.

Over the years other groups have had doo-wop or doo-wop-influenced hits, such as Robert John&#x27;s 1972 version of &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot;, Darts successful revival of the doo-wop standards &quot;Daddy Cool&quot; and &quot;Come Back My Love&quot; in the late 1970s, Toby Beau&#x27;s 1978 hit &quot;My Angel Baby&quot;, and Billy Joel&#x27;s 1984 hit &quot;The Longest Time&quot;. Soul and funk bands such as Zapp released the single (&quot;Doo Wa Ditty (Blow That Thing)/A Touch of Jazz (Playin&#x27; Kinda Ruff Part II)&quot;). The last doo-wop record to reach the top ten on the U.S. pop charts was &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot; by Huey Lewis and the News, a doo-wop adaptation of the Impressions&#x27; 1963 Top 5 smash hit. It reached number 7 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult contemporary chart in June 1993. Much of the album had a doo-wop flavor. Another song from the &quot;By the Way&quot; sessions to feature a doo-wop influence was a cover of &quot;Teenager In Love&quot;, originally recorded by Dion and the Belmonts. The genre would see another resurgence in popularity in 2018, with the release of the album &quot;Love in the Wind&quot; by Brooklyn-based band, the Sha La Das, produced by Thomas Brenneck for the Daptone Record label.

Doo-wop is popular among barbershoppers and collegiate a cappella groups due to its easy adaptation to an all-vocal form. Doo-wop experienced a resurgence in popularity at the turn of the 21st century with the airing of PBS&#x27;s doo-wop concert programs: &quot;Doo Wop 50&quot;, &quot;Doo Wop 51&quot;, and &quot;Rock, Rhythm, and Doo Wop&quot;. These programs brought back, live on stage, some of the better known doo-wop groups of the past. In addition to the Earth Angels, doo-wop acts in vogue in the second decade of the 2000s range from the Four Quarters to Street Corner Renaissance.
Bruno Mars and Meghan Trainor are two examples of current artists who incorporate doo-wop music into their records and live performances. Mars says he has &quot;a special place in [his] heart for old-school music&quot;.

The formation of the hip-hop scene beginning in the late 1970s strongly parallels the rise of the doo-wop scene of the 1950s, particularly mirroring it in the emergence of the urban street culture of the 1990s. According to Bobby Robinson, a well-known producer of the period:
Doo-wop originally started out as the black teenage expression of the &#x27;50s and rap emerged as the black teenage ghetto expression of the &#x27;70s. Same identical thing that started itthe doowop groups down the street, in hallways, in alleys and on the corner. They&#x27;d gather anywhere and, you know, doo-wop doowah da dadada. You&#x27;d hear it everywhere. So the same thing started with rap groups around &#x27;76 or so. All of a sudden, everywhere you turned you&#x27;d hear kids rapping. In the summertime, they&#x27;d have these little parties in the park. They used to go out and play at night and kids would be out there dancing. All of a sudden, all you could hear was, hip hop hit the top don&#x27;t stop. It&#x27;s kidsto a great extent mixed-up and confusedreaching out to express themselves. They were forcefully trying to express themselves and they made up in fantasy what they missed in reality.

<text>Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition that views language and thought as tools for prediction, problem solving, and action, rather than describing, representing, or mirroring reality. Pragmatists contend that most philosophical topics—such as the nature of knowledge, language, concepts, meaning, belief, and science—are best viewed in terms of their practical uses and successes.

Pragmatism began in the United States in the 1870s. Its origins are often attributed to philosophers Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey. In 1878, Peirce described it in his pragmatic maxim: &quot;Consider the practical effects of the objects of your conception. Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object.&quot;

==Origins==
Pragmatism as a philosophical movement began in the United States around 1870. Charles Sanders Peirce (and his pragmatic maxim) is given credit for its development, 
along with later 20th-century contributors, William James and John Dewey. Its direction was determined by The Metaphysical Club members Peirce, Dewey, James, Chauncey Wright and George Herbert Mead.

The word pragmatic has existed in English since the 1500s, borrowed from French and derived from Greek via Latin. The Greek word &quot;pragma&quot;, meaning business, deed or act, is a noun derived from the verb &quot;prassein&quot;, to do.
The first use in print of the name &quot;pragmatism&quot; was in 1898 by James, who credited Peirce with coining the term during the early 1870s. James regarded Peirce&#x27;s &quot;Illustrations of the Logic of Science&quot; series—including &quot;&quot; (1877), and especially &quot;&quot; (1878)—as the foundation of pragmatism. 
Peirce in turn wrote in 1906 that Nicholas St. John Green had been instrumental by emphasizing the importance of applying Alexander Bain&#x27;s definition of belief, which was &quot;that upon which a man is prepared to act&quot;. Peirce wrote that &quot;from this definition, pragmatism is scarce more than a corollary; so that I am disposed to think of him as the grandfather of pragmatism&quot;. John Shook has said, &quot;Chauncey Wright also deserves considerable credit, for as both Peirce and James recall, it was Wright who demanded a phenomenalist and fallibilist empiricism as an alternative to rationalistic speculation.&quot;

Peirce developed the idea that inquiry depends on real doubt, not mere verbal or hyperbolic doubt, and said that, in order to understand a conception in a fruitful way, &quot;Consider the practical effects of the objects of your conception. Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object&quot;, which he later called the pragmatic maxim. It equates any conception of an object to the general extent of the conceivable implications for informed practice of that object&#x27;s effects. This is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental reflection arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances—a method hospitable to the generation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the employment and improvement of verification. Typical of Peirce is his concern with inference to explanatory hypotheses as outside the usual foundational alternative between deductivist rationalism and inductivist empiricism, although he was a mathematical logician and a founder of statistics.

Peirce lectured and further wrote on pragmatism to make clear his own interpretation. While framing a conception&#x27;s meaning in terms of conceivable tests, Peirce emphasized that, since a conception is general, its meaning, its intellectual purport, equates to its acceptance&#x27;s implications for general practice, rather than to any definite set of real effects (or test results); a conception&#x27;s clarified meaning points toward its conceivable verifications, but the outcomes are not meanings, but individual upshots. Peirce in 1905 coined the new name pragmaticism &quot;for the precise purpose of expressing the original definition&quot;, saying that &quot;all went happily&quot; with James&#x27;s and F. C. S. Schiller&#x27;s variant uses of the old name &quot;pragmatism&quot; and that he nonetheless coined the new name because of the old name&#x27;s growing use in &quot;literary journals, where it gets abused&quot;. Yet in a 1906 manuscript, he cited as causes his differences with James and Schiller and, in a 1908 publication, his differences with James as well as literary author Giovanni Papini. Peirce regarded his own views that truth is immutable and infinity is real, as being opposed by the other pragmatists, but he remained allied with them about the falsity of necessitarianism and about the reality of generals and habits understood in terms of potential concrete effects even if unactualized.

Pragmatism enjoyed renewed attention after Willard Van Orman Quine and Wilfrid Sellars used a revised pragmatism to criticize logical positivism in the 1960s. Inspired by the work of Quine and Sellars, a brand of pragmatism known sometimes as neopragmatism gained influence through Richard Rorty, the most influential of the late 20th century pragmatists along with Hilary Putnam and Robert Brandom. Contemporary pragmatism may be broadly divided into a strict analytic tradition and a &quot;neo-classical&quot; pragmatism (such as Susan Haack) that adheres to the work of Peirce, James, and Dewey.

== Core tenets ==

A few of the various but often interrelated positions characteristic of philosophers working from a pragmatist approach include:

*Epistemology (justification): a coherentist theory of justification that rejects the claim that all knowledge and justified belief rest ultimately on a foundation of noninferential knowledge or justified belief. Coherentists hold that justification is solely a function of some relationship between beliefs, none of which are privileged beliefs in the way maintained by foundationalist theories of justification.
*Epistemology (truth): a deflationary or pragmatic theory of truth; the former is the epistemological claim that assertions that predicate the truth of a statement do not attribute a property called truth to such a statement while the latter is the epistemological claim that assertions that predicate the truth of a statement attribute the property of useful-to-believe to such a statement.
*Metaphysics: a pluralist view that there is more than one sound way to conceptualize the world and its content.
*Philosophy of science: an instrumentalist and scientific anti-realist view that a scientific concept or theory should be evaluated by how effectively it explains and predicts phenomena, as opposed to how accurately it describes objective reality.
*Philosophy of language: an anti-representationalist view that rejects analyzing the semantic meaning of propositions, mental states, and statements in terms of a correspondence or representational relationship and instead analyzes semantic meaning in terms of notions like dispositions to action, inferential relationships, and/or functional roles (e.g. behaviorism and inferentialism). Not to be confused with pragmatics, a sub-field of linguistics with no relation to philosophical pragmatism.
*Additionally, forms of empiricism, fallibilism, verificationism, and a Quinean naturalist metaphilosophy are all commonly elements of pragmatist philosophies. Many pragmatists are epistemological relativists and see this to be an important facet of their pragmatism (e.g. Joseph Margolis), but this is controversial and other pragmatists argue such relativism to be seriously misguided (e.g. Hilary Putnam, Susan Haack).

===Anti-reification of concepts and theories===
Dewey in &quot;The Quest for Certainty&quot; criticized what he called &quot;the philosophical fallacy&quot;: Philosophers often take categories (such as the mental and the physical) for granted because they don&#x27;t realize that these are nominal concepts that were invented to help solve specific problems. This causes metaphysical and conceptual confusion. Various examples are the &quot;ultimate Being&quot; of Hegelian philosophers, the belief in a &quot;realm of value&quot;, the idea that logic, because it is an abstraction from concrete thought, has nothing to do with the action of concrete thinking.

David L. Hildebrand summarized the problem: &quot;Perceptual inattention to the specific functions comprising inquiry led realists and idealists alike to formulate accounts of knowledge that project the products of extensive abstraction back onto experience.&quot;

===Naturalism and anti-Cartesianism===
From the outset, pragmatists wanted to reform philosophy and bring it more in line with the scientific method as they understood it. They argued that idealist and realist philosophy had a tendency to present human knowledge as something beyond what science could grasp. They held that these philosophies then resorted either to a phenomenology inspired by Kant or to correspondence theories of knowledge and truth. Pragmatists criticized the former for its a priorism, and the latter because it takes correspondence as an unanalyzable fact. Pragmatism instead tries to explain the relation between knower and known.

In 1868, C.S. Peirce argued that there is no power of intuition in the sense of a cognition unconditioned by inference, and no power of introspection, intuitive or otherwise, and that awareness of an internal world is by hypothetical inference from external facts. Introspection and intuition were staple philosophical tools at least since Descartes. He argued that there is no absolutely first cognition in a cognitive process; such a process has its beginning but can always be analyzed into finer cognitive stages. That which we call introspection does not give privileged access to knowledge about the mind—the self is a concept that is derived from our interaction with the external world and not the other way around. At the same time he held persistently that pragmatism and epistemology in general could not be derived from principles of psychology understood as a special science: what we do think is too different from what we should think; in his &quot;Illustrations of the Logic of Science&quot; series, Peirce formulated both pragmatism and principles of statistics as aspects of scientific method in general. This is an important point of disagreement with most other pragmatists, who advocate a more thorough naturalism and psychologism.

Richard Rorty expanded on these and other arguments in &quot;Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature&quot; in which he criticized attempts by many philosophers of science to carve out a space for epistemology that is entirely unrelated to—and sometimes thought of as superior to—the empirical sciences. W.V. Quine, who was instrumental in bringing naturalized epistemology back into favor with his essay &quot;Epistemology Naturalized&quot;, also criticized &quot;traditional&quot; epistemology and its &quot;Cartesian dream&quot; of absolute certainty. The dream, he argued, was impossible in practice as well as misguided in theory, because it separates epistemology from scientific inquiry.

===Reconciliation of anti-skepticism and fallibilism===
Hilary Putnam has suggested that the reconciliation of anti-skepticism and fallibilism is the central goal of American pragmatism. Although all human knowledge is partial, with no ability to take a &quot;God&#x27;s-eye-view&quot;, this does not necessitate a globalized skeptical attitude, a radical philosophical skepticism (as distinguished from that which is called scientific skepticism). Peirce insisted that (1) in reasoning, there is the presupposition, and at least the hope, that truth and the real are discoverable and would be discovered, sooner or later but still inevitably, by investigation taken far enough, and (2) contrary to Descartes&#x27;s famous and influential methodology in the &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;, doubt cannot be feigned or created by verbal fiat to motivate fruitful inquiry, and much less can philosophy begin in universal doubt. Doubt, like belief, requires justification. Genuine doubt irritates and inhibits, in the sense that belief is that upon which one is prepared to act. It arises from confrontation with some specific recalcitrant matter of fact (which Dewey called a &quot;situation&quot;), which unsettles our belief in some specific proposition. Inquiry is then the rationally self-controlled process of attempting to return to a settled state of belief about the matter. Note that anti-skepticism is a reaction to modern academic skepticism in the wake of Descartes. The pragmatist insistence that all knowledge is tentative is quite congenial to the older skeptical tradition.

===Theory of truth and epistemology===

Pragmatism was not the first to apply evolution to theories of knowledge: Schopenhauer advocated a biological idealism as what&#x27;s useful to an organism to believe might differ wildly from what is true. Here knowledge and action are portrayed as two separate spheres with an absolute or transcendental truth above and beyond any sort of inquiry organisms used to cope with life. Pragmatism challenges this idealism by providing an &quot;ecological&quot; account of knowledge: inquiry is how organisms can get a grip on their environment. &quot;Real&quot; and &quot;true&quot; are functional labels in inquiry and cannot be understood outside of this context. It is not &quot;realist&quot; in a traditionally robust sense of realism (what Hilary Putnam later called metaphysical realism), but it is realist in how it acknowledges an external world which must be dealt with.

Many of James&#x27; best-turned phrases—&quot;truth&#x27;s cash value&quot; and &quot;the true is only the expedient in our way of thinking&quot; —were taken out of context and caricatured in contemporary literature as representing the view where any idea with practical utility is true. William James wrote:

In reality, James asserts, the theory is a great deal more subtle.

The role of belief in representing reality is widely debated in pragmatism. Is a belief valid when it represents reality? &quot;Copying is one (and only one) genuine mode of knowing&quot;. Are beliefs dispositions which qualify as true or false depending on how helpful they prove in inquiry and in action? Is it only in the struggle of intelligent organisms with the surrounding environment that beliefs acquire meaning? Does a belief only become true when it succeeds in this struggle? In James&#x27;s pragmatism nothing practical or useful is held to be necessarily true nor is anything which helps to survive merely in the short term. For example, to believe my cheating spouse is faithful may help me feel better now, but it is certainly not useful from a more long-term perspective because it doesn&#x27;t accord with the facts (and is therefore not true).

==In other fields==
While pragmatism started simply as a criterion of meaning, it quickly expanded to become a full-fledged epistemology with wide-ranging implications for the entire philosophical field. Pragmatists who work in these fields share a common inspiration, but their work is diverse and there are no received views.

===Philosophy of science===
In the philosophy of science, instrumentalism is the view that concepts and theories are merely useful instruments and progress in science cannot be couched in terms of concepts and theories somehow mirroring reality. Instrumentalist philosophers often define scientific progress as nothing more than an improvement in explaining and predicting phenomena. Instrumentalism does not state that truth does not matter, but rather provides a specific answer to the question of what truth and falsity mean and how they function in science.

One of C. I. Lewis&#x27; main arguments in &quot;Mind and the World Order: Outline of a Theory of Knowledge&quot; (1929) was that science does not merely provide a copy of reality but must work with conceptual systems and that those are chosen for pragmatic reasons, that is, because they aid inquiry. Lewis&#x27; own development of multiple modal logics is a case in point. Lewis is sometimes called a proponent of conceptual pragmatism because of this.

Another development is the cooperation of logical positivism and pragmatism in the works of Charles W. Morris and Rudolf Carnap. The influence of pragmatism on these writers is mostly limited to the incorporation of the pragmatic maxim into their epistemology. Pragmatists with a broader conception of the movement do not often refer to them.

W. V. Quine&#x27;s paper &quot;Two Dogmas of Empiricism&quot;, published in 1951, is one of the most celebrated papers of 20th-century philosophy in the analytic tradition. The paper is an attack on two central tenets of the logical positivists&#x27; philosophy. One is the distinction between analytic statements (tautologies and contradictions) whose truth (or falsehood) is a function of the meanings of the words in the statement (&#x27;all bachelors are unmarried&#x27;), and synthetic statements, whose truth (or falsehood) is a function of (contingent) states of affairs. The other is reductionism, the theory that each meaningful statement gets its meaning from some logical construction of terms which refers exclusively to immediate experience. Quine&#x27;s argument brings to mind Peirce&#x27;s insistence that axioms are not a priori truths but synthetic statements.

===Logic===
Later in his life Schiller became famous for his attacks on logic in his textbook, &quot;Formal Logic&quot;. By then, Schiller&#x27;s pragmatism had become the nearest of any of the classical pragmatists to an ordinary language philosophy. Schiller sought to undermine the very possibility of formal logic, by showing that words only had meaning when used in context. The least famous of Schiller&#x27;s main works was the constructive sequel to his destructive book &quot;Formal Logic&quot;. In this sequel, &quot;Logic for Use&quot;, Schiller attempted to construct a new logic to replace the formal logic that he had criticized in &quot;Formal Logic&quot;. What he offers is something philosophers would recognize today as a logic covering the context of discovery and the hypothetico-deductive method.

Whereas Schiller dismissed the possibility of formal logic, most pragmatists are critical rather of its pretension to ultimate validity and see logic as one logical tool among others—or perhaps, considering the multitude of formal logics, one set of tools among others. This is the view of C. I. Lewis. C. S. Peirce developed multiple methods for doing formal logic.

Stephen Toulmin&#x27;s &quot;The Uses of Argument&quot; inspired scholars in informal logic and rhetoric studies (although it is an epistemological work).

===Metaphysics===
James and Dewey were empirical thinkers in the most straightforward fashion: experience is the ultimate test and experience is what needs to be explained. They were dissatisfied with ordinary empiricism because, in the tradition dating from Hume, empiricists had a tendency to think of experience as nothing more than individual sensations. To the pragmatists, this went against the spirit of empiricism: we should try to explain all that is given in experience including connections and meaning, instead of explaining them away and positing sense data as the ultimate reality. Radical empiricism, or Immediate Empiricism in Dewey&#x27;s words, wants to give a place to meaning and value instead of explaining them away as subjective additions to a world of whizzing atoms.
William James gives an interesting example of this philosophical shortcoming:
F. C. S. Schiller&#x27;s first book &quot;Riddles of the Sphinx&quot; was published before he became aware of the growing pragmatist movement taking place in America. In it, Schiller argues for a middle ground between materialism and absolute metaphysics. These opposites are comparable to what William James called tough-minded empiricism and tender-minded rationalism. Schiller contends on the one hand that mechanistic naturalism cannot make sense of the &quot;higher&quot; aspects of our world. These include free will, consciousness, purpose, universals and some would add God. On the other hand, abstract metaphysics cannot make sense of the &quot;lower&quot; aspects of our world (e.g. the imperfect, change, physicality). While Schiller is vague about the exact sort of middle ground he is trying to establish, he suggests that metaphysics is a tool that can aid inquiry, but that it is valuable only insofar as it does help in explanation.

In the second half of the 20th century, Stephen Toulmin argued that the need to distinguish between reality and appearance only arises within an explanatory scheme and therefore that there is no point in asking what &quot;ultimate reality&quot; consists of. More recently, a similar idea has been suggested by the postanalytic philosopher Daniel Dennett, who argues that anyone who wants to understand the world has to acknowledge both the &quot;syntactical&quot; aspects of reality (i.e., whizzing atoms) and its emergent or &quot;semantic&quot; properties (i.e., meaning and value).

Radical empiricism gives answers to questions about the limits of science, the nature of meaning and value and the workability of reductionism. These questions feature prominently in current debates about the relationship between religion and science, where it is often assumed—most pragmatists would disagree—that science degrades everything that is meaningful into &quot;merely&quot; physical phenomena.

===Philosophy of mind===
Both John Dewey in &quot;Experience and Nature&quot; (1929) and, half a century later, Richard Rorty in his &quot;Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature&quot; (1979) argued that much of the debate about the relation of the mind to the body results from conceptual confusions. They argue instead that there is no need to posit the mind or mindstuff as an ontological category.

Pragmatists disagree over whether philosophers ought to adopt a quietist or a naturalist stance toward the mind-body problem. The former, including Rorty, want to do away with the problem because they believe it&#x27;s a pseudo-problem, whereas the latter believe that it is a meaningful empirical question. 

===Ethics===
Pragmatism sees no fundamental difference between practical and theoretical reason, nor any ontological difference between facts and values. Pragmatist ethics is broadly humanist because it sees no ultimate test of morality beyond what matters for us as humans. Good values are those for which we have good reasons, viz. the good reasons approach. The pragmatist formulation pre-dates those of other philosophers who have stressed important similarities between values and facts such as Jerome Schneewind and John Searle.
William James&#x27; contribution to ethics, as laid out in his essay &quot;The Will to Believe&quot; has often been misunderstood as a plea for relativism or irrationality. On its own terms it argues that ethics always involves a certain degree of trust or faith and that we cannot always wait for adequate proof when making moral decisions.
Of the classical pragmatists, John Dewey wrote most extensively about morality and democracy. In his classic article &quot;Three Independent Factors in Morals&quot;, he tried to integrate three basic philosophical perspectives on morality: the right, the virtuous and the good. He held that while all three provide meaningful ways to think about moral questions, the possibility of conflict among the three elements cannot always be easily solved.

Dewey also criticized the dichotomy between means and ends which he saw as responsible for the degradation of our everyday working lives and education, both conceived as merely a means to an end. He stressed the need for meaningful labor and a conception of education that viewed it not as a preparation for life but as life itself.

Dewey was opposed to other ethical philosophies of his time, notably the emotivism of Alfred Ayer. Dewey envisioned the possibility of ethics as an experimental discipline, and thought values could best be characterized not as feelings or imperatives, but as hypotheses about what actions will lead to satisfactory results or what he termed &quot;consummatory experience&quot;. An additional implication of this view is that ethics is a fallible undertaking because human beings are frequently unable to know what would satisfy them.

During the late 1900s and first decade of 2000, pragmatism was embraced by many in the field of bioethics led by the philosophers John Lachs and his student Glenn McGee, whose 1997 book &quot;The Perfect Baby: A Pragmatic Approach to Genetic Engineering&quot; (see designer baby) garnered praise from within classical American philosophy and criticism from bioethics for its development of a theory of pragmatic bioethics and its rejection of the principalism theory then in vogue in medical ethics. An anthology published by the MIT Press titled &quot;Pragmatic Bioethics&quot; included the responses of philosophers to that debate, including Micah Hester, Griffin Trotter and others many of whom developed their own theories based on the work of Dewey, Peirce, Royce and others. Lachs developed several applications of pragmatism to bioethics independent of but extending from the work of Dewey and James.

A recent pragmatist contribution to meta-ethics is Todd Lekan&#x27;s &quot;Making Morality&quot;. Lekan argues that morality is a fallible but rational practice and that it has traditionally been misconceived as based on theory or principles. Instead, he argues, theory and rules arise as tools to make practice more intelligent.

===Aesthetics===
John Dewey&#x27;s &quot;Art as Experience&quot;, based on the William James lectures he delivered at Harvard University, was an attempt to show the integrity of art, culture and everyday experience (&quot;IEP&quot;). Art, for Dewey, is or should be a part of everyone&#x27;s creative lives and not just the privilege of a select group of artists. He also emphasizes that the audience is more than a passive recipient. Dewey&#x27;s treatment of art was a move away from the transcendental approach to aesthetics in the wake of Immanuel Kant who emphasized the unique character of art and the disinterested nature of aesthetic appreciation. A notable contemporary pragmatist aesthetician is Joseph Margolis. He defines a work of art as &quot;a physically embodied, culturally emergent entity&quot;, a human &quot;utterance&quot; that isn&#x27;t an ontological quirk but in line with other human activity and culture in general. He emphasizes that works of art are complex and difficult to fathom, and that no determinate interpretation can be given.

===Philosophy of religion===
Both Dewey and James investigated the role that religion can still play in contemporary society, the former in &quot;A Common Faith&quot; and the latter in &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot;.

From a general point of view, for William James, something is true only insofar as it works. Thus, the statement, for example, that prayer is heard may work on a psychological level but (a) may not help to bring about the things you pray for (b) may be better explained by referring to its soothing effect than by claiming prayers are heard. As such, pragmatism is not antithetical to religion but it is not an apologetic for faith either. James&#x27; metaphysical position however, leaves open the possibility that the ontological claims of religions may be true. As he observed in the end of the Varieties, his position does not amount to a denial of the existence of transcendent realities. Quite the contrary, he argued for the legitimate epistemic right to believe in such realities, since such beliefs do make a difference in an individual&#x27;s life and refer to claims that cannot be verified or falsified either on intellectual or common sensorial grounds.

Joseph Margolis in &quot;Historied Thought, Constructed World&quot; (California, 1995) makes a distinction between &quot;existence&quot; and &quot;reality&quot;. He suggests using the term &quot;exists&quot; only for those things which adequately exhibit Peirce&#x27;s &quot;Secondness&quot;: things which offer brute physical resistance to our movements. In this way, such things which affect us, like numbers, may be said to be &quot;real&quot;, although they do not &quot;exist&quot;. Margolis suggests that God, in such a linguistic usage, might very well be &quot;real&quot;, causing believers to act in such and such a way, but might not &quot;exist&quot;.

===Education===

Pragmatic pedagogy is an educational philosophy that emphasizes teaching students knowledge that is practical for life and encourages them to grow into better people. American philosopher John Dewey is considered one of the main thinkers of the pragmatist educational approach.

==Neopragmatism==

Neopragmatism is a broad contemporary category used for various thinkers that incorporate important insights of, and yet significantly diverge from, the classical pragmatists. This divergence may occur either in their philosophical methodology (many of them are loyal to the analytic tradition) or in conceptual formation: for example, conceptual pragmatist C. I. Lewis was very critical of Dewey; neopragmatist Richard Rorty disliked Peirce.

Important analytic pragmatists include early Richard Rorty (who was the first to develop neopragmatist philosophy in his &quot;Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature&quot; (1979), Hilary Putnam, W. V. O. Quine, and Donald Davidson. Brazilian social thinker Roberto Unger advocates for a radical pragmatism, one that &quot;de-naturalizes&quot; society and culture, and thus insists that we can &quot;transform the character of our relation to social and cultural worlds we inhabit rather than just to change, little by little, the content of the arrangements and beliefs that comprise them&quot;. Late Rorty and Jürgen Habermas are closer to Continental thought.

Neopragmatist thinkers who are more loyal to classical pragmatism include Sidney Hook and Susan Haack (known for the theory of foundherentism). Many pragmatist ideas (especially those of Peirce) find a natural expression in the decision-theoretic reconstruction of epistemology pursued in the work of Isaac Levi. Nicholas Rescher advocated his version of methodological pragmatism, based on construing pragmatic efficacy not as a replacement for truths but as a means to its evidentiation. Rescher was also a proponent of pragmatic idealism.

Not all pragmatists are easily characterized. With the advent of postanalytic philosophy and the diversification of Anglo-American philosophy, many philosophers were influenced by pragmatist thought without necessarily publicly committing themselves to that philosophical school. Daniel Dennett, a student of Quine&#x27;s, falls into this category, as does Stephen Toulmin, who arrived at his philosophical position via Wittgenstein, whom he calls &quot;a pragmatist of a sophisticated kind&quot;. Another example is Mark Johnson whose embodied philosophy shares its psychologism, direct realism and anti-cartesianism with pragmatism. Conceptual pragmatism is a theory of knowledge originating with the work of the philosopher and logician Clarence Irving Lewis. The epistemology of conceptual pragmatism was first formulated in the 1929 book &quot;Mind and the World Order: Outline of a Theory of Knowledge&quot;.

French pragmatism is attended with theorists such as Michel Callon, Bruno Latour, Michel Crozier, Luc Boltanski, and Laurent Thévenot. It often is seen as opposed to structural problems connected to the French critical theory of Pierre Bourdieu. French pragmatism has more recently made inroads into American sociology and anthropology as well.

Philosophers John R. Shook and Tibor Solymosi said that &quot;each new generation rediscovers and reinvents its own versions of pragmatism by applying the best available practical and scientific methods to philosophical problems of contemporary concern&quot;.

==Legacy and contemporary relevance==
In the 20th century, the movements of logical positivism and ordinary language philosophy have similarities with pragmatism. Like pragmatism, logical positivism provides a verification criterion of meaning that is supposed to rid us of nonsense metaphysics; however, logical positivism doesn&#x27;t stress action as pragmatism does. The pragmatists rarely used their maxim of meaning to rule out all metaphysics as nonsense. Usually, pragmatism was put forth to correct metaphysical doctrines or to construct empirically verifiable ones rather than to provide a wholesale rejection.

Ordinary language philosophy is closer to pragmatism than other philosophy of language because of its nominalist character (although Peirce&#x27;s pragmatism is not nominalist) and because it takes the broader functioning of language in an environment as its focus instead of investigating abstract relations between language and world.

Pragmatism has ties to process philosophy. Much of the classical pragmatists&#x27; work developed in dialogue with process philosophers such as Henri Bergson and Alfred North Whitehead, who aren&#x27;t usually considered pragmatists because they differ so much on other points. Nonetheless, philosopher Donovan Irven argues there&#x27;s a strong connection between Henri Bergson, pragmatist William James, and the existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre regarding their theories of truth.

Behaviorism and functionalism in psychology and sociology also have ties to pragmatism, which is not surprising considering that James and Dewey were both scholars of psychology and that Mead became a sociologist.

Pragmatism emphasizes the connection between thought and action. Applied fields like public administration, political science, leadership studies, international relations, conflict resolution, and research methodology have incorporated the tenets of pragmatism in their field. Often this connection is made using Dewey and Addams&#x27;s expansive notion of democracy.

=== Effects on social sciences ===
In the early 20th century, Symbolic interactionism, a major perspective within sociological social psychology, was derived from pragmatism, especially the work of George Herbert Mead and Charles Cooley, as well as that of Peirce and William James.

Increasing attention is being given to pragmatist epistemology in other branches of the social sciences, which have struggled with divisive debates over the status of social scientific knowledge.

Enthusiasts suggest that pragmatism offers an approach that is both pluralist and practical.

=== Effects on public administration ===
The classical pragmatism of John Dewey, William James, and Charles Sanders Peirce has influenced research in the field of public administration. Scholars claim classical pragmatism had a profound influence on the origin of the field of public administration. At the most basic level, public administrators are responsible for making programs &quot;work&quot; in a pluralistic, problems-oriented environment. Public administrators are also responsible for the day-to-day work with citizens. Dewey&#x27;s participatory democracy can be applied in this environment. Dewey and James&#x27; notion of theory as a tool, helps administrators craft theories to resolve policy and administrative problems. Further, the birth of American public administration coincides closely with the period of greatest influence of the classical pragmatists.

Which pragmatism (classical pragmatism or neo-pragmatism) makes the most sense in public administration has been the source of debate. The debate began when Patricia M. Shields introduced Dewey&#x27;s notion of the Community of Inquiry. Hugh Miller objected to one element of the community of inquiry (problematic situation, scientific attitude, participatory democracy): scientific attitude. A debate that included responses from a practitioner, an economist, a planner, other public administration scholars, and noted philosophers followed. Miller and Shields also responded.

In addition, applied scholarship of public administration that assesses charter schools, contracting out or outsourcing, financial management, performance measurement, urban quality of life initiatives, and urban planning in part draws on the ideas of classical pragmatism in the development of the conceptual framework and focus of analysis.

The health sector&#x27;s administrators&#x27; use of pragmatism has been criticized as incomplete in its pragmatism, however, according to the classical pragmatists, knowledge is always shaped by human interests. The administrator&#x27;s focus on &quot;outcomes&quot; simply advances their own interest, and this focus on outcomes often undermines their citizen&#x27;s interests, which often are more concerned with process. On the other hand, David Brendel argues that pragmatism&#x27;s ability to bridge dualisms, focus on practical problems, include multiple perspectives, incorporate participation from interested parties (patient, family, health team), and provisional nature makes it well suited to address problems in this area.

=== Effects on feminism ===
Since the mid 1990s, feminist philosophers have re-discovered classical pragmatism as a source of feminist theories. Works by Seigfried, Duran, Keith, and Whipps explore the historic and philosophic links between feminism and pragmatism. The connection between pragmatism and feminism took so long to be rediscovered because pragmatism itself was eclipsed by logical positivism during the middle decades of the twentieth century. As a result, it was lost from feminist discourse. Feminists now consider pragmatism&#x27;s greatest strength to be the very features that led to its decline. These are &quot;persistent and early criticisms of positivist interpretations of scientific methodology; disclosure of value dimension of factual claims&quot;; viewing aesthetics as informing everyday experience; subordinating logical analysis to political, cultural, and social issues; linking the dominant discourses with domination; &quot;realigning theory with praxis; and resisting the turn to epistemology and instead emphasizing concrete experience&quot;.

Feminist philosophers point to Jane Addams as a founder of classical pragmatism. Mary Parker Follett was also an important feminist pragmatist concerned with organizational operation during the early decades of the 20th century. In addition, the ideas of Dewey, Mead, and James are consistent with many feminist tenets. Jane Addams, John Dewey, and George Herbert Mead developed their philosophies as all three became friends, influenced each other, and were engaged in the Hull House experience and women&#x27;s rights causes.

==Criticisms==
In the 1908 essay &quot;The Thirteen Pragmatisms&quot;, Arthur Oncken Lovejoy argued that there&#x27;s significant ambiguity in the notion of the effects of the &quot;truth&quot; of a proposition and those of &quot;belief&quot; in a proposition in order to highlight that many pragmatists had failed to recognize that distinction. He identified 13 different philosophical positions that were each labeled pragmatism.

The Franciscan friar Celestine Bittle presented multiple criticisms of pragmatism in his 1936 book &quot;Reality and the Mind: Epistemology&quot;. He argued that, in William James&#x27;s pragmatism, truth is entirely subjective and is not the widely accepted definition of truth, which is correspondence to reality. For Bittle, defining truth as what is useful is a &quot;perversion of language&quot;. With truth reduced essentially to what is good, it is no longer an object of the intellect. Therefore, the problem of knowledge posed by the intellect is not solved, but rather renamed. Renaming truth as a product of the will cannot help it solve the problems of the intellect, according to Bittle. Bittle cited what he saw as contradictions in pragmatism, such as using objective facts to prove that truth does not emerge from objective fact; this reveals that pragmatists do recognize truth as objective fact, and not, as they claim, what is useful. Bittle argued there are also some statements that cannot be judged on human welfare at all. Such statements (for example the assertion that &quot;a car is passing&quot;) are matters of &quot;truth and error&quot; and do not affect human welfare.

British philosopher Bertrand Russell devoted a chapter each to James and Dewey in his 1945 book &quot;A History of Western Philosophy&quot;; Russell pointed out areas in which he agreed with them but also ridiculed James&#x27;s views on truth and Dewey&#x27;s views on inquiry. Hilary Putnam later argued that Russell &quot;presented a mere caricature&quot; of James&#x27;s views and a &quot;misreading of James&quot;, while Tom Burke argued at length that Russell presented &quot;a skewed characterization of Dewey&#x27;s point of view&quot;. Elsewhere, in Russell&#x27;s book &quot;The Analysis of Mind&quot;, Russell praised James&#x27;s radical empiricism, to which Russell&#x27;s own account of neutral monism was indebted. Dewey, in &quot;The Bertrand Russell Case&quot;, defended Russell against an attempt to remove Russell from his chair at the College of the City of New York in 1940.

Neopragmatism as represented by Richard Rorty has been criticized as relativistic both by other neopragmatists such as Susan Haack and by many analytic philosophers. Rorty&#x27;s early analytic work, however, differs notably from his later work which some, including Rorty, consider to be closer to literary criticism than to philosophy, and which attracts the brunt of criticism from his detractors.

<doc id="95171" wikidata="Q53247" url="?curid=95171" title="Panasonic">
<text>is a Japanese multinational electronics company, headquartered in Kadoma, Osaka Prefecture, Japan. It was founded in 1918 as in Fukushima, Osaka City by Kōnosuke Matsushita. In 1935, it was incorporated and renamed In 2008, it changed its name to In 2022, it became a holding company and was renamed.

In addition to consumer electronics, of which it was the world&#x27;s largest maker in the late 20th century, Panasonic offers a wide range of products and services, including rechargeable batteries, automotive and avionic systems, industrial systems, as well as home renovation and construction. Panasonic has a primary listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX 100 indices. It has a secondary listing on the Nagoya Stock Exchange.

==Corporate name==
From 1925 to October 1, 2008, the company&#x27;s corporate name was &quot;Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.&quot; (MEI). On January 10, 2008, the company announced that it would change its name to &quot;Panasonic Corporation&quot;, in effect on October 1, 2008, to conform with its global brand name &quot;Panasonic&quot;. The name change was approved at the shareholders&#x27; meeting on June 26, 2008.

In 2022, Panasonic announced a reorganization plan which split the company into Panasonic Holdings Corporation (the former Panasonic Corporation) and conversion of its divisions into subsidiaries; the Lifestyle Updates Business Division being the division that took the Panasonic Corporation name after the reorganization. The reorganization took effect on April 1, 2022.

==Brand names==
Panasonic Corporation currently sells virtually all of its products and services worldwide under the Panasonic brand, having phased out the Sanyo brand in the first quarter of 2012. It uses the marketing slogan &quot;A Better Life, A Better World&quot;. The company has sold products under a number of other brand names during its history.

In 1927, Matsushita adopted the brand name for a new lamp product. In 1955, the company began branding audio speakers and lamps as &quot;PanaSonic&quot; for markets outside of Japan. Further refined to Panasonic, taken from the words &quot;pan&quot; – meaning &quot;all&quot; – and &quot;sonic&quot; – meaning &quot;sound&quot;, the brand was created for the Americas because the National brand was already registered by others. Panasonic also sold the first bread machine.

The company began to use the brand name in 1965 for audio equipment. The use of multiple brands lasted for some decades. While National had been the premier brand on most Matsushita products, including audio and video, National and Panasonic were combined as National Panasonic in 1997 after the worldwide success of the Panasonic name.

In 1974, Motorola sold its Quasar brand and facilities to Matsushita.

In May 2003, the company announced that Panasonic would become its global brand, and launched the global tagline &quot;Panasonic ideas for life.&quot; By March 2004, Matsushita replaced the National name for products and outdoor signboards, except for those in Japan. They would eventually phase out the National brand in Japan by March 2010.

In September 2013, the company adopted a new tagline to better illustrate their vision: &quot;A Better Life, A Better World.&quot;

The Chinese company Shun Hing Electric Works and Engineering Co. Ltd (信興電工工程有限公司) has sold imported Panasonic and National branded product under the brand name Rasonic since the Matsushita Electric Industrial era. They have also sold MEI and Panasonic products under their original brand names. In June 1994, Panasonic Shun Hing Industrial Devices Sales (Hong Kong) Co., Ltd. (松下信興機電(香港)有限公司) and Panasonic SH Industrial Sales (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. (松下電器機電(深圳)有限公司) were established by joint venture between Matsushita Electric Industrial and Shun Hing Group respectively, making Rasonic a product brand for MEI and subsequently the Panasonic Corporation.

In September 2014, Panasonic announced the revival of the Technics brand, first in European markets in December of that year.

==History==

===20th century===

Panasonic, then Matsushita Electric, was founded in 1918 by Kōnosuke Matsushita as a vendor of duplex lamp sockets. In the 1920s, Matsushita began regularly launching products. In 1927, he produced a line of bicycle lamps that were the first to be marketed with the &quot;National&quot; brand name. During World War II, the company operated factories in Japan and other parts of Asia which produced electrical components and appliances such as light fixtures, motors, electric irons, wireless equipment and its first vacuum tubes.

After the war, the Matsushita group, largely having been split into MEI and MEW by the dissolution imposed by the occupation force, imperfectly regrouped as a &quot;Keiretsu&quot; and began to supply the post-war boom in Japan with radios and appliances, as well as bicycles. Matsushita&#x27;s brother-in-law, Toshio Iue, founded Sanyo as a subcontractor for components after World War II. Sanyo grew to become a competitor to Matsushita, but was later acquired by Panasonic in December 2009.

In 1961, Matsushita traveled to the United States and met American dealers. The company began producing television sets for the U.S. market under the &quot;Panasonic&quot; brand name, and expanded the use of the brand to Europe in 1979.

Its plant in 1963 produced eight TV sets per minute, accounting for 21.8% of Japan&#x27;s production of cathode ray tube television sets at the time, the largest share out of any company.

The company used the National brand outside North America from the 1950s to the 1970s (the trademark could not be used in the United States because it was already in use). The inability to use the National brand name led to the creation of the Panasonic brand in the United States. Over the next several decades, Matsushita released additional products, including black and white TVs (1952), electrical blenders, fridges (1953), rice cookers (1959), color TVs, and microwave ovens (1966).

The company debuted a high-fidelity audio speaker in Japan in 1965 with the brand &quot;Technics&quot;. This line of high quality stereo components became a worldwide favorite, the most famous products being its turntables, such as the SL-1200 record player, known for its high-performance, precision and durability. Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Matsushita continued to produce high-quality specialized electronics for niche markets, such as shortwave radios, and developed its successful line of stereo receivers, CD players and other components.

In 1968, Matsushita began to make rotary compressors for air conditioners, and, in 1971, it began to make absorption chillers, also for air-conditioning applications.

In 1972, Matsushita established its first overseas factory, in Malaysia.

In 1973, Matsushita established &quot;Anam National&quot;, joint venture with Anam Group in South Korea.

In 1983, Matsushita launched the Panasonic Senior Partner, the first fully IBM PC compatible Japanese-made computer. A year later, Panasonic released the Executive Partner, the first affordable portable computer with a plasma display. Around this time the company also introduced inverter air conditioners.

In 1984, Matsushita established the &quot;Panasoft&quot; software label, which published software for MSX computers from 1984 to 1989. The company also manufactured MSX computers of their own, such as Panasonic FS-A1.

In November 1990, Matsushita agreed to acquire an American media company, MCA Inc., the predecessor of both Universal Music Group and Universal Pictures, for US$6.59 billion. The acquisition was preceded by the takeover of Columbia Pictures by Sony, the arch rival of Matsushita. At the time, Matsushita had dominated the home video market with the company&#x27;s leading position in the electronics market. It had been strengthened by VHS, the de facto standard of consumer videotape that Matsushita and JVC co-introduced. Inspired by Sony&#x27;s bold quest for Hollywood, Matsushita believed it could become a leader in the film industry as well. However, Matsushita subsequently sold 80% of MCA to Seagram Company for US$7 billion in April 1995, demoralized by the high volatility of the film industry.

In 1992, Matsushita made the Panasonic FS-A1GT, the last model of the MSX turbo R computer.

In 1993, Matsushita released the CF-V21P, the first notebook computer to have an integrated CD-ROM drive as an option (although only up to 80mm/3.5 inch diameter mini CDs instead of standard 120mm/4.7 inch diameter discs).

In 1998, Matsushita sold Anam National to Anam Electronics.

The $US5 billion plant would employ 6,500 people, and reduce Tesla&#x27;s battery costs by 30 per cent.

Due to increased competition from China, Panasonic&#x27;s Li-ion automotive market share decreased from 47% in 2014 to 34% in 2015. In June 2016, Tesla announced that Panasonic would be the exclusive supplier of batteries for its mass market vehicle Model 3. Batteries for the higher-end Model S sedan and Model X SUV will also be supplied by Panasonic. In early 2016, Panasonic president Kazuhiro Tsuga confirmed a planned total investment of about $1.6 billion by the company to construct Gigafactory to full capacity. However, after the number of Model 3 reservations became known in April, Panasonic moved production plans forward and announced a bond sale for $US3.86 billion, most of it to be invested in Gigafactory.

===MCA Inc.===
Matsushita bought American media company MCA Inc. for US$6.6 billion. In 1995, it sold 80% of MCA&#x27;s shares to Canadian drink company Seagram. MCA was renamed Universal Studios Inc. in 1996, after which its motion picture business has changed hands continuously, Vivendi, General Electric and Comcast in order, while the music division has become Universal Music Group, acquired and wholly owned by Vivendi up until 2019.

===Panasonic 3DO===
Panasonic manufactured 3DO gaming systems from 1993 to 1996 alongside other manufacturers backing the standard, however it was not a success. There were a total of 2 million systems sold during its lifespan, although it is not known how many of these were sold by each manufacturer. Panasonic obtained exclusive rights to develop and manufacture the 3DO&#x27;s successor, the M2, after purchasing the properties and technology from The 3DO Company, but ultimately backed out of releasing it in 1997 due to the highly competitive state of the console gaming market at that time.

===Panasonic Healthcare===
In 2014, Panasonic Healthcare was bought by outside investors and renamed &quot;PHCHD&quot;, which stands for Panasonic HealthCare HD. It mainly makes cryogenic and ULT freezers for laboratories and sterilization equipment.

=== Panasonic Semiconductor Solutions ===
Panasonic had been in the semiconductor industry since 1957, when it started the mass production of silicon transistors and bipolar ICs. From 2012 onwards the company had implemented a series of measures to boost productivity of the business, including transfers of its production facilities to a joint venture with TowerJazz, and the system-on-a-chip designing unit to Panasonic/Fujitsu joint venture Socionext.

In 2019, Panasonic decided to sell its remaining chip business and the stake in the joint venture with TowerJazz to Nuvoton following heavy losses.

==Products==
Panasonic has offered a wide range of products and services, including air conditioners, refrigerators, washing machines, compressors, lighting, televisions, personal computers (Matsushita JR series, ), mobile phones (as a subsidiary of TCL Electronics), audio equipment, cameras, broadcasting equipment, projectors, automotive electronics, aircraft in-flight entertainment systems, semiconductors, lithium batteries, electrical components, optical devices, bicycles, electronic materials, video game systems (3DO), and photovoltaic modules. Ventilation appliances such as electric fans are manufactured under KDK and rebranded as Panasonic.

==Environmental record==
Panasonic is ranked in joint 11th place (out of 16) in Greenpeace&#x27;s Guide to Greener Electronics, which ranks electronics manufacturers on policies and practices to reduce their impact on the climate, produce greener products and make their operations more sustainable. The company is one of the top scorers on the Products criteria, praised for its good product life cycles and the number of products which are free from polyvinyl chloride plastic (PVC). It also scores maximum points for the energy efficiency of its products with 100 percent of its TVs meeting the latest Energy Star standards and exceeding the standby power requirement.

However, Panasonic&#x27;s score is let down by its low score on the Energy criteria, with the Guide stating it must focus on planned reductions of greenhouse gases (GHG), set targets to reduce GHG emissions by at least 30% by 2015 and increase renewable energy use by 2020.

In 2014, an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Panasonic will compensate its expatriate workers in China a &quot;hazard pay&quot; as compensation for the chronic air pollution they are subjected to as they work.

In 2020, Panasonic joined WIPO GREEN as an official partner in an effort to address climate change.

In February 2022, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Panasonic got its highest-emitting Chinese factory to &quot;virtually net zero&quot; carbon dioxide.

<text>Lev Semyonovich Vygotsky (, ; ; – June 11, 1934) was a Russian and Soviet psychologist, best known for his work on psychological development in children and creating the framework known as cultural-historical activity theory. After his early death, his books and research were banned in the Soviet Union until Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, with a first collection of major texts published in 1956. 

His major ideas include:
*&quot;The Social Origin of Mind:&quot; Vygotsky believed that human mental and cognitive abilities are not biologically determined, but instead created and shaped by use of language and tools in the process of interacting and constructing the cultural and social environment.
*&quot;The Importance of Mediation:&quot; He saw mediation as the key to human development, because it leads to the use of cultural tools and becomes a pathway for psychological development through the process of interiorization.
*&quot;The Zone of Proximal Development:&quot; Vygotsky introduced the concept of the ZPD which refers to the gap between a child&#x27;s current level of development and the level they are capable of reaching with tools provided by others with more knowledge.
*&quot;The Significance of Play:&quot; Vygotsky viewed play as a crucial aspect of children&#x27;s development, as he thought of it as the best sandbox to build and develop the practice of mediation.

==Biography==
Lev Simkhovich Vygodsky (his patronymic was later changed to &quot;Semyonovich&quot; and his surname to &quot;Vygotsky&quot; for unclear reasons) was born on November 17, 1896, in the town of Orsha in Mogilev Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Belarus) into a non-religious middle-class family of Russian Jewish extraction. His father Simkha Leibovich (also known as Semyon Lvovich) was a banker and his mother was Tsetsilia Moiseevna.

Vygotsky was raised in the city of Gomel, where he was home-schooled until 1911 and then obtained a formal degree with distinction in a private Jewish gymnasium, which allowed him entrance to a university. In 1913, Vygotsky was admitted to the Moscow University by mere ballot through a &quot;Jewish Lottery&quot;: at the time a three percent Jewish student quota was administered for entry in Moscow and Saint Petersburg universities. He had an interest in the humanities and social sciences, but at the insistence of his parents he applied to the medical school at Moscow University. During the first semester of study, he transferred to the law school. In parallel, he attended lectures at Shanyavsky Moscow City People&#x27;s University. Vygotsky&#x27;s early interests were in the arts and, primarily, in the topics of the history of the Jewish people, the tradition, culture and Jewish identity.

In January 1924, Vygotsky took part in the Second All-Russian Psychoneurological Congress in Petrograd (soon thereafter renamed Leningrad). After the Congress, Vygotsky met with Alexander Luria and with his help received an invitation to become a research fellow at the Psychological Institute in Moscow which was under the direction of Konstantin Kornilov. Vygotsky moved to Moscow with his new wife, Roza Smekhova, with whom he would have two children. He began his career at the Psychological Institute as a &quot;staff scientist, second class&quot;. He also became a secondary school teacher, covering a period marked by his interest in the processes of learning and the role of language in learning.

By the end of 1925, Vygotsky completed his dissertation titled &quot;The Psychology of Art&quot;, which was not published until the 1960s, and a book titled &quot;Pedagogical Psychology&quot;, which apparently drew on lecture notes he prepared in Gomel while he was a psychology instructor at local educational establishments. In the summer of 1925 he made his first and only trip abroad to a London congress on the education of the deaf. Upon return to the Soviet Union, he was hospitalized due to tuberculosis and would remain an invalid and out of work until the end of 1926. His dissertation was accepted as the prerequisite of a scholarly degree, which was awarded to Vygotsky in autumn 1925 &quot;in absentia&quot;.

After his release from the hospital, Vygotsky did theoretical and methodological work on the crisis in psychology, but never finished the draft of the manuscript and interrupted his work on it around mid-1927. The manuscript was published later with notable editorial interventions and distortions in 1982 and was presented by the editors as one of the most important of Vygotsky&#x27;s works. In this early manuscript, Vygotsky argued for the formation of a general psychology that could unite the naturalist objectivist strands of psychological science with the more philosophical approaches of Marxist orientation. However, he also harshly criticized those of his colleagues who attempted to build a &quot;Marxist Psychology&quot; as an alternative to the naturalist and philosophical schools. He argued that if one wanted to build a truly Marxist Psychology, there were no shortcuts to be found by merely looking for applicable quotes in the writings of Marx. Rather one should look for a methodology that was in accordance with the Marxian spirit.

From 1926 to 1930, Vygotsky worked on a research program investigating the development of higher psychological functions, i.e. culturally governed lower psychological functions such as voluntary attention, selective memory, object-oriented action, and decision making. During this period he gathered a group of collaborators including Alexander Luria, Boris Varshava, Alexei Leontiev, Leonid Zankov, and several others. Vygotsky guided his students in researching this phenomenon from three different perspectives: 
* The instrumental approach, which aimed to understand the ways humans use objects as mediation aids in memory and reasoning.
* A developmental approach, focused on how children acquire higher cognitive functions during development
* A culture-historical approach, studying how social and cultural patterns of interaction shape forms of mediation and developmental trajectories 

Vygotsky died of a relapse of tuberculosis on June 11, 1934, at the age of 37, in Moscow. One of Vygotsky&#x27;s last private notebook entries was:

==Major themes of research==
Vygotsky was a pioneering psychologist with interests in extremely diverse fields: his work covered topics such as the origin and the psychology of art, development of higher mental functions, philosophy of science and the methodology of psychological research, the relation between learning and human development, concept formation, interrelation between language and thought development, play as a psychological phenomenon, learning disabilities, and abnormal human development (aka &quot;defectology&quot;). His philosophical framework includes interpretations of the cognitive role of mediation tools, as well as the re-interpretation of well-known concepts in psychology such as internalization of knowledge. Vygotsky introduced the notion of zone of proximal development, a metaphor capable of describing the potential of human cognitive development.

His most important and widely known contribution is his theory for the development of &quot;higher psychological functions,&quot; which emerge through unification of interpersonal connections and actions taken within a given socio-cultural environment (i.e. language, culture, society, and tool-use). It was during this period that he identified the play of young children as their &quot;leading activity&quot;, which he understood to be the main source of preschoolers&#x27; psychological development, and which he viewed as an expression of an inseparable unity of emotional, volitional, and cognitive development.

While Vygotsky never met Jean Piaget, he had read a number of his works and agreed on some of his perspectives on learning. At some point (around 1929–30), Vygotsky came to disagree with Piaget&#x27;s understanding of learning and development, and held a different theoretical position from Piaget on the topic of inner speech; Piaget thought that egocentric speech follows from inner speech and &quot;dissolved away&quot; as children matured. Vygotsky showed that egocentric speech became inner speech, and then called &quot;thoughts&quot;. Piaget only read Vygotsky&#x27;s work after his death and openly praised him for his discovery of the social origin of children&#x27;s thoughts, reasoning, and moral judgements.

=== Cultural-historical theory ===
The hypothesis put forward by Vygotsky was a paradigm shift in psychology. He was first to propose that all psychological functions that govern mental, cognitive and physical actions of the individual are not immutable but have a history of cultural development (in human history and in everyone personally) through interiorization of cultural tools. Therefore, the process of transformation which is happening when current cultural tools are interiorized becomes the focus of psychological research.

Vygotsky posits the existence of lower and higher mental functions. The latter have social origins and complex system structure, mediated by cultural tools and controlled by an individual. Vygotsky came to the conclusion that consciousness is possible because of the mediated nature of higher psychological functions. Between the stimulus and the reaction of a person (both behavioral and mental), an additional connection arises through a mediating link - a stimulus-means, or a sign. Signs are tools that mediate higher psychological functions and control one&#x27;s own behavior. A word could direct attention, create personal meaning, form a concept and coordinate.

Vygotsky illustrated his idea of mediation via Buridan&#x27;s ass paradox. A problematic situation of choosing between two equal possibilities, interested Vygotsky primarily from the point of view of solving it through a coin flip - redelegating decision to the outside object - an example of using cultural tools to govern one&#x27;s own psychological function of volition.

While developing a method for studying higher psychological functions, Vygotsky was guided by the principle of &quot;ex ungue leonem&quot; and additionally analyzed phenomena such as using a knot in the handkerchief for remembering and finger counting.

=== Cultural mediation and internalization ===
Vygotsky studied child development and the significant roles of cultural mediation and interpersonal communication. He observed how higher mental functions developed through these interactions, and also represented the shared knowledge of a culture. This process is known as internalization. &quot;Internalization&quot; may be understood in one respect as &quot;knowing how&quot;. For example, the practices of riding a bicycle or pouring a cup of milk, initially, are outside and beyond the child. The mastery of the skills needed for performing these practices occurs through the activity of the child within society. A further aspect of internalization is &quot;appropriation&quot;, in which children take tools and adapt them to personal use, perhaps using them in unique ways. Internalizing the use of a pencil allows the child to use it very much for personal ends rather than drawing exactly what others in society have drawn previously:

=== Zone of Proximal Development ===
&quot;Zone of Proximal Development&quot; (ZPD) is a term Vygotsky used to characterize an individual&#x27;s mental development. He originally defined the ZPD as &quot;the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers.&quot; He used the example of two children in school who originally could solve problems at an eight-year-old developmental level (that is, typical for children who were age 8). After each child received assistance from an adult, one was able to perform at a nine-year-old level and one was able to perform at a twelve-year-old level. He said &quot;This difference between twelve and eight, or between nine and eight, is what we call &quot;the zone of proximal development.&quot;&quot; He further said that the ZPD &quot;defines those functions that have not yet matured but are in the process of maturation, functions that will mature tomorrow but are currently in an embryonic state.&quot; The zone is bracketed by the learner&#x27;s current ability and the ability they can achieve with the aid of an instructor of some capacity. The ZPD multidimensional model says that the ideas of the zone of proximal development can be applied to development in other areas of life, such as personality development as well. 

==== Scaffolding ====
According to Vygotsky, through the assistance of a more knowledgeable other, a child is able to learn skills or aspects of a skill that go beyond the child&#x27;s actual developmental or maturational level. This assistance is defined as &#x27;scaffolding&#x27;. The lower limit of ZPD is the level of skill reached by the child working independently (also referred to as the child&#x27;s developmental level). The upper limit is the level of potential skill that the child is able to reach with the assistance of a more capable instructor. In this sense, the ZPD provides a prospective view of cognitive development, as opposed to a retrospective view that characterizes development in terms of a child&#x27;s independent capabilities. The advancement through and attainment of the upper limit of the ZPD is limited by the instructional and scaffolding-related capabilities of the more knowledgeable other (MKO). The MKO is typically assumed to be an older, more experienced teacher or parent, but often can be a learner&#x27;s peer or someone their junior. The MKO need not even be a person, it can be a machine or book, or other source of visual and/or audio input. Another significant property of the ZPD and scaffolding is reciprocal teaching. This is when the child and instructor have an open-dialogue with each other in order for the child to create new opportunities to acquire new information and ideas. 

==== Importance of play ====

Play is crucial to the social cognitive development of children. According to Vygotsky, play is where the &quot;Zone of Proximal Development&quot; is most effective. He thought that if he could define the features of play he could gain insight into its role in development. Vygotsky focused on the symbolism of play to describe how play shapes development. There were two important aspects that Vygotsky focused on. First, all representational play creates an imaginary situation that permits the child to grapple with unresonable desires. This aspect helps the child develop a sense of delayed gratification. The second feature of all representational play is that it contains rules for behavior that children must follow to successfully act out the play scene. This aspect of play helps children to develop their understanding of social rules as even the simplest play is based in rules. This expresses the understanding of rules in children. Imaginary play, in particular, develops the ability in children to process external and internal stimuli. Imagination helps children to differentiate real and make believe objects, a task that must be practiced. Overall, play is important in children due to the social rules they must follow.

=== &quot;Thinking and Speech&quot; ===
In the last years of his life, Vygotsky paid most of his attention to the study of the relationship between thought and word in the structure of consciousness. This problem was explored in Vygotsky&#x27;s book, &quot;Thinking and Speech&quot;, that was published posthumously in 1934. The book was a collection of essays and scholarly papers that Vygotsky wrote during different periods of his thought development. It was edited by his closest associates Kolbanovskii, Zankov, and Shif. The book established the connection between speech and the development of mental concepts and awareness. Vygotsky described silent inner speech as being qualitatively different from verbal external speech, but both equally important. Vygotsky believed inner speech developed from external speech via a gradual process of &quot;internalization&quot; (i.e., transition from the external to the internal), with younger children only really able to &quot;think out loud&quot;. He claimed that in its mature form, inner speech would not resemble spoken language as we know it (in particular, being greatly compressed). Hence, thought itself developed socially.

Inner speech, according to Vygotsky, develops through the accumulation of long-term functional and structural changes. It branches off from the child&#x27;s external speech along with the differentiation of the social and egocentric functions of speech, and, finally, the speech functions acquired by the child become the main functions of his thinking.

In this work, Vygotsky points out the genesis of the development of thinking and speech and that the relationship between them is not a constant value.

==Legacy==

===Soviet Union===
After Vygotsky&#x27;s early death, his books and research were banned until Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, with a first collection of major texts published in 1956. A small group of his collaborators and students were able to continue his lines of thought in research. The members of the group laid a foundation for the systematic development of Vygotskian psychology in such diverse fields as the psychology of memory (P. Zinchenko), perception, sensation, and movement (Zaporozhets, Asnin, A. N. Leont&#x27;ev), personality (Lidiya Bozhovich, Asnin, A. N. Leont&#x27;ev), will and volition (Zaporozhets, A. N. Leont&#x27;ev, P. Zinchenko, L. Bozhovich, Asnin), psychology of play (G. D. Lukov, Daniil El&#x27;konin) and psychology of learning (P. Zinchenko, L. Bozhovich, D. El&#x27;konin), as well as the theory of step-by-step formation of mental actions (Pyotr Gal&#x27;perin), general psychological activity theory (A. N. Leont&#x27;ev) and psychology of action (Zaporozhets). Andrey Puzyrey elaborated the ideas of Vygotsky in respect of psychotherapy and even in the broader context of deliberate psychological intervention (psychotechnique), in general.

===United States===
Only a couple of Vygotsky&#x27;s texts were published in English before the translation of &quot;Thinking and Speech&quot; in 1962. Since then, the majority of his texts have been translated, and his ideas have become influential in some modern educational approaches. The first proponents of Vygotsky in the USA were Michael Cole and James Wertsch. Today, an umbrella term for theoretical framework based on Vygotsky&#x27;s ideas is &quot;Cultural-historical activity theory&quot; (aka CHAT) or &quot;Activity theory&quot;.

<text>Y′UV, also written YUV, is the color model found in the PAL analogue color TV standard. A color is described as a Y′ component (luma) and two chroma components U and V. The prime symbol (&#x27;) denotes that the luma is calculated from gamma-corrected RGB input and that it is different from true luminance. Today, the term YUV is commonly used in the computer industry to describe colorspaces that are encoded using YCbCr.

In TV formats, color information (U and V) was added separately via a subcarrier so that a black-and-white receiver would still be able to receive and display a color picture transmission in the receiver&#x27;s native black-and-white format, with no need for extra transmission bandwidth.

As for etymology, Y, Y′, U, and V are not abbreviations. The use of the letter Y for luminance can be traced back to the choice of XYZ primaries. This lends itself naturally to the usage of the same letter in luma (Y′), which approximates a perceptually uniform correlate of luminance. Likewise, U and V were chosen to differentiate the U and V axes from those in other spaces, such as the x and y chromaticity space. See the equations below or compare the historical development of the math.

== Related color models ==
The scope of the terms Y′UV, YUV, YCbCr, YPbPr, etc., is sometimes ambiguous and overlapping.

* Y′UV is the separation used in PAL.
* YDbDr is the format used in SECAM and PAL-N, unusually based on non-gamma-corrected (linear) RGB, making the Y component true luminance.
* Y′IQ is the format used in NTSC television.
* Y&#x27;PbPr is the separation used in component video. 
* Y′CbCr is any digital encoding of Y&#x27;PbPr suited for video and image compression and transmission formats such as MPEG and JPEG.

All these formats are based on a luma component and two chroma components describing the color difference from gray. In all formats other than Y′IQ, each chroma component is a scaled version of the difference between red/blue and Y; the main difference lies in the scaling factors used, which is determined by color primaries and the intended numeric range (compare the use of &quot;Umax&quot; and &quot;Vmax&quot; in with a fixed in ). In Y′IQ, the UV plane is rotated by 33°.

== History ==
Y′UV was invented when engineers wanted color television in a black-and-white infrastructure. They needed a signal transmission method that was compatible with black-and-white (B&amp;W) TV while being able to add color. The luma component already existed as the black and white signal; they added the UV signal to this as a solution.

The UV representation of chrominance was chosen over straight R and B signals because U and V are color difference signals. In other words, the U and V signals tell the television to shift the color of a certain spot without altering its brightness, or to make one color brighter at the cost of the other and by how much it should be shifted. The higher (or the lower when negative) the U and V values are, the more saturated (colorful) the spot gets. The closer the U and V values get to zero, the lesser it shifts the color meaning that the red, green and blue lights will be more equally bright, producing a grayer spot. This is the benefit of using color difference signals, i.e. instead of telling how much red there is to a color, it tells by how much it is more red than green or blue.

In turn this meant that when the U and V signals would be zero or absent, it would just display a grayscale image. If R and B were to have been used, these would have non-zero values even in a B&amp;W scene, requiring all three data-carrying signals. This was important in the early days of color television, because old black and white TV signals had no U and V signals present, meaning the color TV would just display it as B&amp;W TV out of the box. In addition, black and white receivers could take the Y′ signal and ignore the U- and V-color signals, making Y′UV backward-compatible with all existing black-and-white equipment, input and output. If the color-TV standard wouldn&#x27;t have used color difference signals, it could mean a color TV would make funny colors out of a B&amp;W broadcast or it would need additional circuitry to translate the B&amp;W signal to color.

It was necessary to assign a narrower bandwidth to the chrominance channel because there was no additional bandwidth available. If some of the luminance information arrived via the chrominance channel (as it would have if RB signals were used instead of differential UV signals), B&amp;W resolution would have been compromised.

== Conversion to/from RGB ==

=== SDTV with BT.470 ===
Y′UV signals are typically created from RGB (red, green and blue) source. Weighted values of R, G, and B are summed to produce Y′, a measure of overall brightness or luminance. U and V are computed as scaled differences between Y′ and the B and R values.

PAL (NTSC used YIQ, which is further rotated) standard defines the following constants, derived from BT.470 System M primaries and white point using SMPTE RP 177 (same constants called matrix coefficients were used later in BT.601, although it uses 1/2 instead of 0.436 and 0.615):

:formula_1

PAL signals in Y′UV are computed from R&#x27;G&#x27;B&#x27; (only SECAM IV used linear RGB) as follows:

:formula_2

The resulting ranges of Y′, U, and V respectively are [0, 1], [−&quot;U&quot;max, &quot;U&quot;max], and [−&quot;V&quot;max, &quot;V&quot;max].

Inverting the above transformation converts Y′UV to RGB:

:formula_3

Equivalently, substituting values for the constants and expressing them as matrices gives these formulas for BT.470 System M (PAL):

:formula_4

For small values of Y&#x27; it is possible to get R, G, or B values that are negative so in practice we clamp the RGB results to the interval [0,1] or more correctly clamp inside the Y&#x27;CbCr.

In BT.470 a mistake was made because 0.115 was used instead of 0.114 for blue and 0.493 was the result instead of 0.492. In practice that did not affect the decoders because the approximation 1/2.03 was used.

=== HDTV with BT.709 ===
For HDTV the ATSC decided to change the basic values for WR and WB compared to the previously selected values in the SDTV system. For HDTV these values are provided by Rec. 709. This decision further impacted on the matrix for the Y′UV↔RGB conversion so that its member values are also slightly different. As a result, with SDTV and HDTV there are generally two distinct Y′UV representations possible for any RGB triple: a SDTV-Y′UV and an HDTV-Y′UV one. This means in detail that when directly converting between SDTV and HDTV, the luma (Y′) information is roughly the same but the representation of the chroma (U &amp; V) channel information needs conversion. Still in coverage of the CIE 1931 color space the Rec. 709 color space is almost identical to Rec. 601 and covers 35.9%. In contrast to this UHDTV with Rec. 2020 covers a much larger area and thus its very own matrix was derived for YCbCr (no YUV/Y′UV, since decommissioning of analog TV).

BT.709 defines these weight values:

:formula_5
The &quot;U&quot;max and &quot;V&quot;max values are from above.

The conversion matrices for analog form of BT.709 are these, but there is no evidence those were ever used in practice (instead only actually described form of BT.709 is used, the YCbCr form):

:formula_6

=== Notes ===
* The weights used to compute Y′ (top row of matrix) are identical to those used in the Y′IQ color space.
* Equal values of red, green and blue (i.e. levels of gray) yield 0 for U and V. Black, RGB=(0, 0, 0), yields YUV=(0, 0, 0). White, RGB=(1, 1, 1), yields YUV=(1, 0, 0).
* These formulas are traditionally used in analog televisions and equipment; digital equipment such as HDTV and digital video cameras use Y′CbCr.

== Luminance/chrominance systems in general ==
The primary advantage of luma/chroma systems such as Y′UV, and its relatives Y′IQ and YDbDr, is that they remain compatible with black and white analog television (largely due to the work of Georges Valensi). The Y′ channel saves all the data recorded by black and white cameras, so it produces a signal suitable for reception on old monochrome displays. In this case, the U and V are simply discarded. If displaying color, all three channels are used, and the original RGB information can be decoded.

Another advantage of Y′UV is that some of the information can be discarded in order to reduce bandwidth. The human eye has fairly little spatial sensitivity to color: the accuracy of the brightness information of the luminance channel has far more impact on the image detail discerned than that of the other two. Understanding this human shortcoming, standards such as NTSC and PAL reduce the bandwidth of the chrominance channels considerably. (Bandwidth is in the temporal domain, but this translates into the spatial domain as the image is scanned out.)

Therefore, the resulting U and V signals can be substantially &quot;compressed&quot;. In the NTSC (Y′IQ) and PAL systems, the chrominance signals had significantly narrower bandwidth than that for the luminance. Early versions of NTSC rapidly alternated between particular colors in identical image areas to make them appear adding up to each other to the human eye, while all modern analogue and even most digital video standards use chroma subsampling by recording a picture&#x27;s color information at reduced resolution. Only half the horizontal resolution compared to the brightness information is kept (termed 4:2:2 chroma subsampling), and often the vertical resolution is also halved (giving 4:2:0). The 4:x:x standard was adopted due to the very earliest color NTSC standard which used a chroma subsampling of 4:1:1 (where the horizontal color resolution is quartered while the vertical is full resolution) so that the picture carried only a quarter as much color resolution compared to brightness resolution. Today, only high-end equipment processing uncompressed signals uses a chroma subsampling of 4:4:4 with identical resolution for both brightness and color information.

The I and Q axes were chosen according to bandwidth needed by human vision, one axis being that requiring the most bandwidth, and the other (fortuitously at 90 degrees) the minimum. However, true I and Q demodulation was relatively more complex, requiring two analog delay lines, and NTSC receivers rarely used it.

However, this color modulation strategy is lossy, particularly because of crosstalk from the luma to the chroma-carrying wire, and vice versa, in analogue equipment (including RCA connectors to transfer a digital signal, as all they carry is analogue composite video, which is either YUV, YIQ, or even CVBS). Furthermore, NTSC and PAL encoded color signals in a manner that causes high bandwidth chroma and luma signals to mix with each other in a bid to maintain backward compatibility with black and white television equipment, which results in dot crawl and cross color artifacts. When the NTSC standard was created in the 1950s, this was not a real concern since the quality of the image was limited by the monitor equipment, not the limited-bandwidth signal being received. However today&#x27;s modern television is capable of displaying more information than is contained in these lossy signals. To keep pace with the abilities of new display technologies, attempts were made since the late 1970s to preserve more of the Y′UV signal while transferring images, such as SCART (1977) and S-Video (1987) connectors.

Instead of Y′UV, Y′CbCr was used as the standard format for (digital) common video compression algorithms such as MPEG-2. Digital television and DVDs preserve their compressed video streams in the MPEG-2 format, which uses a fully defined Y′CbCr color space, although retaining the established process of chroma subsampling. Cinepak, a video codec from 1991, used a modified YUV 4:2:0 colorspace. The professional CCIR 601 digital video format also uses Y′CbCr at the common chroma subsampling rate of 4:2:2, primarily for compatibility with previous analog video standards. This stream can be easily mixed into any output format needed.

Y′UV is not an absolute color space. It is a way of encoding RGB information, and the actual color displayed depends on the actual RGB colorants used to display the signal. Therefore, a value expressed as Y′UV is only predictable if standard RGB colorants are used (i.e. a fixed set of primary chromaticities, or particular set of red, green, and blue).

Furthermore, the range of colors and brightnesses (known as the color gamut and color volume) of RGB (whether it be BT.601 or Rec. 709) is far smaller than the range of colors and brightnesses allowed by Y′UV. This can be very important when converting from Y′UV (or Y′CbCr) to RGB, since the formulas above can produce &quot;invalid&quot; RGB values – i.e., values below 0% or very far above 100% of the range (e.g., outside the standard 16–235 luma range (and 16–240 chroma range) for TVs and HD content, or outside 0–255 for standard definition on PCs). Unless these values are dealt with they will usually be &quot;clipped&quot; (i.e., limited) to the valid range of the channel affected. This changes the hue of the color, which is very undesirable, so it is therefore often considered better to desaturate the offending colors such that they fall within the RGB gamut.

Likewise, when RGB at a given bit depth is converted to YUV at the same bit depth, several RGB colors can become the same Y′UV color, resulting in information loss.

== Relation with Y′CbCr ==
Y′UV is often used as a term for YCbCr. However, while related, they are different formats with different scale factors; additionally, unlike YCbCr, Y’UV has historically used two different scale factors for the U component vs. the V component. Not scaled matrix is used in Photo CD&#x27;s PhotoYCC. U and V are bipolar signals which can be positive or negative, and are zero for grays, whereas YCbCr usually scales all channels to either the 16–235 range or the 0–255 range, which makes Cb and Cr unsigned quantities where 128 represents gray.

Nevertheless, the relationship between them in the standard case is simple. In particular, the Y&#x27; channels of both are linearly related to each other, both Cb and U are related linearly to (B-Y), and both Cr and V are related linearly to (R-Y).

<doc id="95182" wikidata="Q3378723" url="?curid=95182" title="Phi Kappa Psi">
<text>Phi Kappa Psi (), commonly known as Phi Psi, is an American collegiate social fraternity that was founded at Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania in 1852. The fraternity has over ninety chapters at accredited four-year colleges and universities throughout the United States. More than 179,000 men have been initiated into Phi Kappa Psi since its founding. Phi Kappa Psi and Phi Gamma Delta, both founded at the same college, form the Jefferson Duo.

==History==

In the winter of 1850, a typhoid fever epidemic hit Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Many students left school. Among those who remained were William Henry Letterman and Charles Page Thomas Moore. They chose to care for their classmates who were stricken with the contagious disease, and a strong bond was formed.

The following school year, Letterman and Moore decided to found a fraternity based on &quot;the great joy of serving others&quot; that they experienced during the epidemic. Letterman and Moore founded Phi Kappa Psi in Widow Letterman&#x27;s home on the campus of Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania on February 19, 1852.

The fraternity&#x27;s first Grand Arch Council convened in 1853 in Charlottesville, Virginia. At the 1885 Grand Arch Council in Columbus, Ohio, a special committee was created to draft a new constitution. The fraternity also decided to prohibit chapters from honorary initiations. The new constitution was ratified at the 1886 Grand Arch Council in Indianapolis, Indiana.

In 1894 in New York City, the Arch Grand Council passed a resolution to oppose hazing for its undergraduate members, becoming the first fraternity to publicly oppose hazing. The Arch Grand Council adopted the Phi Kappa Psi Creed in 1964.

== Symbols ==
The coat of arms as adopted in 1908 has a sable (black) field, but today it is most often seen as shown in the adjacent infobox. The fraternity&#x27;s official colors are Cardinal Red and Hunter Green. The badge is a textured bordered shield with a lamp resting on a book at the bottom and an eye surrounded by two stars at the top. In the center of the shield are the Greek letters &#x27;, &#x27;, and .

The fraternity flag is in the proportions of eight and one-half feet wide by six feet high; it was designed in 1916 following instructions from the Grand Arch Council. 

The colors are the official fraternity colors and the design is three vertical stripes of equal width, a hunter green in the middle, flanked on either side by a cardinal red stripe. A smaller version is available with proportions roughly three and one-half feet wide by two feet high. The fraternity song is &quot;Amici&quot;. Its root dates back to the traditional song &quot;Annie Lisle&quot;.

== Governance ==

=== Executive Council ===
The Executive Council of Phi Kappa Psi is composed of the President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and six Archons. Since its founding, Phi Kappa Psi has been controlled by undergraduates. This unique system of governance is achieved by a governing body, the Executive Council, which is made up of a majority of elected undergraduates. These undergraduates, known as Archons, represent the six Districts of Phi Kappa Psi, which divide the nation into roughly equal parts based on the number of chapters represented. Archons are elected during meetings of each District during District Councils, held during odd-numbered years. Four alumni also serve on the Executive Council and are elected at Grand Arch Councils, held during even-numbered years.

=== Grand Chapters ===
Phi Kappa Psi&#x27;s first form of government centered on a Grand Chapter. One chapter at a time was designated the Grand Chapter, and it was responsible for governing the national fraternity. This lasted until 1886 when a new constitution changed to the current form of government.

In 1992, Phi Kappa Psi began to award one exceptional chapter with the Grand Chapter Award. Its name is derived from the fraternity&#x27;s first form of government. This award was initially granted biennially at Grand Arch Councils. 2001 marked the first time that this award was granted in an odd-numbered year, and it has been an annual award ever since.

=== Grand Arch Councils ===

The supreme governing body of Phi Kappa Psi is the Grand Arch Council (G.A.C.). The first Grand Arch Council convened in 1853 in Charlottesville, Virginia. The council met at an irregular schedule until an entirely new form of government was ratified in 1886. Beginning in 1888, nearly all G.A.C.s have occurred biennially, except 1944 which was canceled due to World War II and 2020 which was canceled due to the COVID-19 epidemic.
===The Order of the S.C.===
The Order of the S.C. was formed in 1920 at the Grand Arch Council to recognize the most loyal of alumni. It regarded by Phi Kappa Psi as a &quot;fraternity within a fraternity&quot;. Entrance can only be gained by performing, to the satisfaction of the Order, one or more acts of benefit to the fraternity and attending at least seven Grand Arch Councils. The Order meets every two years, during Phi Kappa Psi&#x27;s biennial Grand Arch Council. The words which the initials &quot;S.C.&quot; represent are held secret by its members.

==Phi Kappa Psi Foundation==
Organized in 1914, the Phi Kappa Psi Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, public educational foundation. It funds scholarships, grants, fellowships, and assistantships for Phi Psis and other students across the country.

==Chapters==
The Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity is composed of chapters and alumni associations, the former of which is the scope of this section. Each chapter is chartered to an individual host institution. These host institutions must be accredited four-year degree-granting colleges and universities in a state, province, territory, or federal district of Canada or the United States. To date, chapter charters have only been granted to groups at U.S. institutions.

When Phi Kappa Psi is extending to an institution that does not currently have a chapter, a probationary group called a &quot;colony&quot; is formed. After the criteria are met, that colony receives its charter and becomes a chapter.

A chapter becomes inactive when it relinquishes its charter, or the charter is revoked by the fraternity, such as was the case with California Beta until its renewal.

===Chapter naming convention===
The chapter naming convention is composed of the top-level subnational division of that chapter&#x27;s host institution, and a Greek letter in alphabetical order from when the charter was originally issued. For example, the first Phi Psi chapter is from Jefferson College in Canonsburg, &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;. The first letter in the Greek alphabet is &quot;Alpha&quot;. Hence, the chapter name is &quot;Pennsylvania Alpha&quot;. The second chapter, and the first in Virginia, was installed at the University of Virginia, so it is the &quot;Virginia Alpha&quot; chapter. The third chapter overall, and the second in Virginia, was installed at Washington &amp; Lee University, so it is the Virginia Beta chapter. The George Washington University chapter is the only chapter ever chartered in the District of Columbia, so it is the &quot;District of Columbia Alpha&quot; chapter.

If borders change, the chapter name does not. Virginia Delta was chartered at Bethany College in 1859. After the Civil War, Bethany College was in West Virginia, but the chapter remained &quot;Virginia Delta&quot;.

Chapters are named based on when the charter is granted, not when it is installed. As a result, there have been rare instances when the chapter naming convention may not appear to be consistent with the charter dates. For example, four charters have been granted in Iowa; the second granted was the fourth installed, so Iowa Beta was installed after Iowa Gamma and Iowa Delta.

==Membership==
An active member of the fraternity is a full-time enrolled student at his chapter&#x27;s host institution at the undergraduate, graduate, or post-graduate level; all others, including members who have graduated or transferred to a school without a Phi Psi chapter, are considered alumni. Men may be initiated into Phi Kappa Psi either by an active chapter, or as part of a colony that is being installed as a chapter. Members typically join Phi Kappa Psi when a chapter extends an offer to enter into a probationary period known as pledgeship, which within the organization, and per National guidelines lasts no more than 6 weeks and concludes with initiation.

Membership is normally only granted to men who are enrolled as full-time students at a chapter&#x27;s host institution. There have been three exceptions to this:
:1. Alumni of a colony which became a chapter after their graduation, and for two years after.
:2. Men who have been of service to a chapter, but not students at the institution.
:3. Honorary membership extended to men of prominence, a practice that was banned in 1885.

==Scandals and misconduct==
Despite policies put in place by the national fraternity to curtail hazing and other abusive behavior, Local chapters or members have occasionally been involved in events that lead to deaths or sexual assault. The following events have been cited as impacting chapters and their communities:

* In 1984, Liz Seccuro was drugged and raped at the Phi Kappa Psi house on the University of Virginia campus. William Beebe, who was not a member of the fraternity, pled guilty to sexual battery in 2007, following a written confession he had made to Seccuro as part of his Alcoholics Anonymous program. Two others were implicated during an investigation of the Beebe case. They retained legal counsel and invoked the Fifth Amendment when questioned before a grand jury and were ultimately not charged.
* In a 2009 incident, members were accused of stealing University of Arizona student newspapers that contained a news story about a student who alleged that she had been drugged with GHB and possibly raped while blacked out at a house party. The homework of two chapter members was found at the same location where the stolen newspapers were discarded. Emails from friends and relatives of Phi Kappa Psi members confirmed that the theft had been organized by the fraternity&#x27;s leadership to stop the spreading of the allegations.
* In 2013, West Virginia University placed its chapter on suspension following an alleged hazing incident. According to the Morgantown Police Department, a 19-year-old pledge was pushed against a wall and suffered a split chin and broken teeth while doing push-ups and other hazing rituals. After a joint investigation by both the university and the national fraternity, the chapter house was closed and the chapter was suspended for five semesters.
* In 2014, Brown University suspended its Phi Kappa Psi chapter after two female students reported that they rapidly became intoxicated at the fraternity&#x27;s party and tested positive for the date rape drug GHB. Chapter officials disputed the test results and a subsequent investigation by the university showed that the results were inconclusive for the presence of GHB due to errors in laboratory procedures. In 2016, the female students sued the university for intentionally mishandling the case because a Brown University trustee&#x27;s son was accused of drugging them with plans to sexually assault them.
* In 2017, Matthew Ellis, a Phi Kappa Psi pledge at Texas State University, attended a fraternity event and was found unresponsive in an off-campus apartment complex the next morning. Ellis&#x27; death led the university suspend all Greek activities on campus soon after. The chapter of Phi Kappa Psi at Texas State University had been put on suspension by the national organization a week earlier for unrelated violations. The local police placed the fraternity under investigation to determine the cause of his death.
* In 2020, Cornell University &quot;permanently revoked&quot; recognition of its chapter of Phi Kappa Psi nearly a year after a freshman student was found dead in a gorge after leaving an illegal Christmas-themed &quot;dirty rush&quot; party in October 2019.
* In 2025, four members of the San Diego State University chapter faced several charges in relation to an incident the previous February. The members allegedly performed a skit where a pledge had his legs set on fire, resulting in burns to 16% of his body. The burned pledge was among the four people charged.

===University of Virginia gang rape hoax===

In a since-retracted November 2014 article in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Sabrina Erdely reported in detail allegations of a 2012 gang rape, and reported in brief on allegations of two subsequent gang rapes at the University of Virginia. Following the story the fraternity voluntarily suspended activity there. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; apologized for the article, and after investigating the accusations, Phi Kappa Psi, ABC News, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said they had found significant discrepancies in the account.

On January 12, the University of Virginia reinstated the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity after the police investigation concluded that no incident had occurred at the fraternity. On April 5, 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; formally retracted the story. Sabrina Erdely publicly apologized for the article on the same day. The next day, leaders of the Phi Kappa Psi chapter announced the fraternity would file a lawsuit against &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; over the article. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has settled the case and paid the Phi Kappa Psi chapter at the University of Virginia $1.65 million.

<text>Hannah Arendt (, ; ; born Johanna Arendt; 14 October 1906 – 4 December 1975) was a German and American historian and philosopher. She was one of the most influential political theorists of the twentieth century.

Her works cover a broad range of topics, but she is best known for those dealing with the nature of wealth, power, and evil, as well as politics, direct democracy, authority, tradition, and totalitarianism. She is also remembered for the controversy surrounding the trial of Adolf Eichmann, for her attempt to explain how ordinary people become actors in totalitarian systems, which was considered by some an apologia, and for the phrase &quot;the banality of evil.&quot; Her name appears in the names of journals, schools, scholarly prizes, humanitarian prizes, think-tanks, and streets; appears on stamps and monuments; and is attached to other cultural and institutional markers that commemorate her thought.

Hannah Arendt was born to a Jewish family in Linden in 1906. Her father died when she was seven. Arendt was raised in a politically progressive, secular family, her mother being an ardent Social Democrat. After completing secondary education in Berlin, Arendt studied at the University of Marburg under Martin Heidegger, with whom she engaged in a romantic affair that began while she was his student. She obtained her doctorate in philosophy at the University of Heidelberg in 1929. Her dissertation was entitled &quot;Love and Saint Augustine&quot;, and her supervisor was the existentialist philosopher Karl Jaspers.

Hannah Arendt married Günther Stern in 1929 but soon began to encounter increasing antisemitism in the 1930s Nazi Germany. In 1933, Arendt was briefly imprisoned by the Gestapo for performing illegal research into antisemitism. On release, she fled Germany, living in Czechoslovakia and Switzerland before settling in Paris. There she worked for Youth Aliyah, assisting young Jews to emigrate to the British Mandate of Palestine. She was stripped of her German citizenship in 1937. Divorcing Stern that year, she then married Heinrich Blücher in 1940. When Germany invaded France that year she was detained by the French as an alien. She escaped and made her way to the United States in 1941. She settled in New York, which remained her principal residence for the rest of her life. She became a writer and editor and worked for the Jewish Cultural Reconstruction, becoming an American citizen in 1950. Arendt opposed racial integration in the United States, believing that it was an overreach of government authority and that &quot;children should not be thrust into the front-lines of geopolitical conflict&quot;. With the publication of &quot;The Origins of Totalitarianism&quot; in 1951, her reputation as a thinker and writer was established, and a series of works followed. These included the books &quot;The Human Condition&quot; in 1958, as well as &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot; and &quot;On Revolution&quot; in 1963. She taught at many American universities while declining tenure-track appointments. She died suddenly of a heart attack in 1975, leaving her last work, &quot;The Life of the Mind&quot;, unfinished.

== Early life and education (1906–1929) ==
=== Family ===

Hannah Arendt was born Johanna Arendt in 1906, in the Wilhelmine period. Her secular and educated Jewish family lived comfortably in Linden, Prussia (now a part of Hanover). They were merchants of Russian extraction from Königsberg. Her grandparents were members of the Reform Jewish community. Her paternal grandfather, , was a prominent businessman, local politician, and leader of the Königsberg Jewish community, a member of the Central Organization for German Citizens of Jewish Faith (). Like other members of the he primarily saw himself as German, disapproving of Zionist activities including Kurt Blumenfeld, a frequent visitor and later one of Hannah&#x27;s mentors. Her lifelong best-friend, Anne Mendehlsohn, was likewise connected to a dynasty of philosophers and musicians. Of Max Arendt&#x27;s children, Paul Arendt was an engineer and Henriette Arendt a policewoman and social worker.

Hannah was the only child of Paul and Martha Arendt (née Cohn), who were married on 11 April 1902. She was named after her paternal grandmother. The Cohns had originally come to Königsberg from nearby Russian territory of Lithuania in 1852, as refugees from antisemitism, and made their living as tea importers, J. N. Cohn &amp; Company being the largest business in the city. The Arendts reached Germany from Russia a century earlier. Hannah&#x27;s extended family contained many more women, who shared the loss of husbands and children. Hannah&#x27;s parents were more educated and politically more to the left than her grandparents. The young couple were Social Democrats, rather than the German Democrats that most of their contemporaries supported. Paul Arendt was educated at the Albertina (University of Königsberg). Though he worked as an engineer, he prided himself on his love of Classics, with a large library that Hannah immersed herself in. Martha Cohn, a musician, had studied for three years in Paris.

In the first four years of their marriage, the Arendts lived in Berlin, and were supporters of the socialist journal &quot;Socialist Monthly Bulletins&quot; (). At the time of Hannah&#x27;s birth, Paul Arendt was employed by an electrical engineering firm in Linden, and they lived in a frame house on the market square (). They moved back to Königsberg in 1909 because of Paul&#x27;s deteriorating health. He suffered from chronic syphilis and was institutionalized in the Königsberg psychiatric hospital in 1911. For years afterward, Hannah had to have annual WR tests for congenital syphilis. He died on 30 October 1913, when Hannah was seven, leaving her mother to raise her. They lived at Hannah&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s house at Tiergartenstraße 6, a leafy residential street adjacent to the Königsberg Tiergarten, in the predominantly Jewish neighborhood of Hufen. Although Hannah&#x27;s parents were non-religious, they were happy to allow Max Arendt to take Hannah to the Reform synagogue. She also received religious instruction from the rabbi, Hermann Vogelstein, who would come to her school for that purpose. Her family moved in circles that included many intellectuals and professionals. It was a social circle of high standards and ideals. As she recalled it:

This time was a particularly favorable period for the Jewish community in Königsberg, an important center of the &quot;Haskalah&quot; (Jewish Enlightenment). Arendt&#x27;s family was thoroughly assimilated (&quot;Germanized&quot;) and she later remembered: &quot;With us from Germany, the word &#x27;assimilation&#x27; received a &#x27;deep&#x27; philosophical meaning. You can hardly realize how serious we were about it.&quot; Despite these conditions, the Jewish population lacked full citizenship rights, and although antisemitism was not overt, it was not absent. Arendt came to define her Jewish identity negatively after encountering overt antisemitism as an adult. She came to greatly identify with Rahel Varnhagen, the Prussian socialite who desperately wanted to assimilate into German culture, only to be rejected because she was born Jewish. Arendt later said of Varnhagen that she was &quot;my very closest woman friend, unfortunately dead a hundred years now.&quot;

In the last two years of the First World War, Hannah&#x27;s mother organized social democratic discussion groups and became a follower of Rosa Luxemburg as socialist uprisings broke out across Germany. Luxemburg&#x27;s writings would later influence Hannah&#x27;s political thinking. In 1920, Martha Cohn married Martin Beerwald, an ironmonger and widower of four years, and they moved to his home, two blocks away, at Busoldstrasse 6, providing Hannah with improved social and financial security. Hannah was 14 at the time and acquired two older stepsisters, Clara and Eva.

=== Education ===
==== Early education ====

Hannah Arendt&#x27;s mother, who considered herself progressive, brought her daughter up on strict Goethean lines. Among other things this involved the reading of Goethe&#x27;s complete works, summed up as (And just what is your duty? The demands of the day). Goethe, was then considered the essential mentor of (education), the conscious formation of mind, body and spirit. The key elements were considered to be self-discipline, constructive channeling of passion, renunciation and responsibility for others. Hannah&#x27;s developmental progress () was carefully documented by her mother in a book, she called (Our Child), measuring her against the benchmark of what was then considered (&quot;normal development&quot;).

Arendt attended kindergarten from 1910 where her precocity impressed her teachers and enrolled in the Szittnich School, Königsberg (Hufen-Oberlyzeum), on Bahnstraße in August 1913, but her studies there were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I, forcing the family to temporarily flee to Berlin on 23 August 1914, in the face of the advancing Russian army. There they stayed with her mother&#x27;s younger sister, Margarethe Fürst, and her three children, while Hannah attended a girl&#x27;s school in Berlin-Charlottenburg. After ten weeks, when Königsberg appeared to be no longer threatened, the Arendts were able to return, where they spent the remaining war years at her grandfather&#x27;s house. Arendt&#x27;s precocity continued, learning ancient Greek as a child, writing poetry in her teenage years, and starting both a &quot;Graecae&quot; (reading group for studying classical literature) and philosophy club at her school. She was fiercely independent in her schooling and a voracious reader, absorbing French and German literature and poetry (committing large amounts to memory) and philosophy. By the age of 14, she had read Kierkegaard, Jaspers&#x27; and Kant&#x27;s (&quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;). Kant, whose hometown was also Königsberg, was an important influence on her thinking, and it was Kant who had written about Königsberg that &quot;such a town is the right place for gaining knowledge concerning men and the world even without travelling&quot;.

Arendt attended the Königin-Luise-Schule for her secondary education, a girls&#x27; Gymnasium on Landhofmeisterstraße. Most of her friends, while at school, were gifted children of Jewish professional families, generally older than she was, and who went on to university education. Among them was Ernst Grumach, who introduced her to his girlfriend, Anne Mendelssohn, who would become a lifelong friend. When Anne moved away, Ernst became Arendt&#x27;s first romantic relationship.
==== Higher education (1922–1929) ====

===== Berlin (1922–1924) =====
Arendt was expelled from the Luise-Schule in 1922, at the age of 15, for leading a boycott of a teacher who insulted her. Her mother sent her to Berlin to Social Democrat family friends. She lived in a student residence and audited courses at the University of Berlin (1922–1923), including classics and Christian theology under Romano Guardini. She successfully sat for the entrance examination () for the University of Marburg, where Ernst Grumach had studied with Martin Heidegger (appointed as a professor in 1923). Her mother had engaged a private tutor, and her aunt Frieda Arendt, a teacher, also helped, while Frieda&#x27;s husband Ernst Aron provided financial tuition assistance.

===== Marburg (1924–1926) =====
In Berlin, Guardini had introduced her to Kierkegaard, and she resolved to make theology her major field. At Marburg (1924–1926) she studied classical languages, German literature, Protestant theology with Rudolf Bultmann and philosophy with Nicolai Hartmann and Heidegger. She arrived in the fall in the middle of an intellectual revolution led by the young Heidegger, of whom she was in awe, describing him as &quot;the hidden king [who] reigned in the realm of thinking&quot;.

Heidegger had broken away from the intellectual movement started by Edmund Husserl, whose assistant he had been at University of Freiburg before coming to Marburg. This was a period when Heidegger was preparing his lectures on Kant, which he would develop in the second part of his (Being and Time) in 1927 and (1929). In his classes, he and his students struggled with the meaning of &quot;Being&quot; as they studied Aristotle&#x27;s and Plato&#x27;s &quot;Sophist&quot; concept of truth, to which Heidegger opposed the pre-Socratic term ἀλήθεια. Many years later Arendt would describe these classes, how people came to Marburg to hear him, and how, above all he imparted the idea of (&quot;thinking&quot;) as activity, which she qualified as &quot;passionate thinking&quot;.

Arendt was restless, finding her studies neither emotionally nor intellectually satisfying. She was ready for passion, finishing her poem (Consolation, 1923) with the lines:
(The hours run down.The days pass on.One achievement remains:merely existing.)

Her encounter with Heidegger represented a dramatic departure from the past. He was handsome, a genius, romantic, and taught that thinking and &quot;aliveness&quot; were but one. The 18-year-old Arendt then began a long romantic relationship with the 35-year-old Heidegger, who was married with two young sons. Arendt later faced criticism for this because of Heidegger&#x27;s support for the Nazi Party after his election as rector at Freiburg University in 1933. Nevertheless, he remained one of the most profound influences on her thinking, and he would later relate that she had been the inspiration for his work on passionate thinking in those days. They agreed to keep the details of the relationship a secret while preserving their letters. The relationship was unknown until Elisabeth Young-Bruehl&#x27;s biography of Arendt appeared in 1982. At the time of publishing, Arendt and Heidegger were deceased but Heidegger&#x27;s wife, Elfride, was still alive. The affair was not well known until 1995, when Elzbieta Ettinger gained access to the sealed correspondence and published a controversial account that was used by Arendt&#x27;s detractors to cast doubt on her integrity. That account, which caused a scandal, was subsequently refuted.

At Marburg, Arendt lived at Lutherstraße 4. Among her friends was Hans Jonas, a Jewish classmate. Another fellow student of Heidegger&#x27;s was Jonas&#x27; friend, the Jewish philosopher Günther Siegmund Stern, who would later become her first husband. Stern had completed his doctoral dissertation with Edmund Husserl at Freiburg, and was now working on his &quot;Habilitation&quot; thesis with Heidegger, but Arendt, involved with Heidegger, took little notice of him at the time.

====== &quot;Die Schatten&quot; (1925) ======
In the summer of 1925, while home at Königsberg, Arendt composed her sole autobiographical piece, (The Shadows), a &quot;description of herself&quot; addressed to Heidegger. In this essay, full of anguish and Heideggerian language, she reveals her insecurities relating to her femininity and Jewishness, writing abstractly in the third person. She describes a state of &quot; (alienation), on the one hand an abrupt loss of youth and innocence, on the other an &quot; (strangeness), the finding of the remarkable in the banal. In her detailing of the pain of her childhood and longing for protection she shows her vulnerabilities and how her love for Heidegger had released her and once again filled her world with color and mystery. She refers to her relationship with Heidegger as &quot;&quot; (&quot;an unbending devotion to a unique man&quot;). This period of intense introspection was also one of the most productive of her poetic output, such as (Lost in Self-Contemplation).

===== Freiburg and Heidelberg (1926–1929) =====
After a year at Marburg, Arendt spent a semester at Freiburg, attending the lectures of Husserl. In 1926 she moved to the University of Heidelberg, completing her dissertation in 1929 under Karl Jaspers. Jaspers, a friend of Heidegger, was the other leading figure of the then-new and revolutionary &quot;Existenzphilosophie&quot;. Her thesis was entitled &quot;Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin: Versuch einer philosophischen Interpretation&quot; (On the concept of love in the thought of Saint Augustine: Attempt at a philosophical interpretation). She remained a lifelong friend of Jaspers and his wife, Gertrud Mayer, developing a deep intellectual relationship with him. At Heidelberg, her circle of friends included Hans Jonas, who had also moved from Marburg to study Augustine, working on his (1930), and also a group of three young philosophers: Karl Frankenstein, Erich Neumann and Erwin Loewenson. Other friends and students of Jaspers were the linguists Benno von Wiese and Hugo Friedrich (seen with Hannah, below), with whom she attended lectures by Friedrich Gundolf at Jaspers&#x27; suggestion and who kindled in her an interest in German Romanticism. She also became reacquainted, at a lecture, with Kurt Blumenfeld, who introduced her to Jewish politics. At Heidelberg, she lived in the old town () near the castle, at Schlossberg 16. The house was demolished in the 1960s, but the one remaining wall bears a plaque commemorating her time there.
On completing her dissertation, Arendt turned to her , initially on German Romanticism, and thereafter an academic teaching career. However 1929 was also the year of the Depression and the end of the golden years () of the Weimar Republic, which was to become increasingly unstable over its remaining four years. Arendt, as a Jew, had little if any chance of obtaining an academic appointment in Germany. Nevertheless, she completed most of the work before she was forced to leave Germany.

== Career ==

=== Germany (1929–1933) ===

==== Berlin-Potsdam (1929) ====

In 1929, Arendt met Günther Stern again, this time in Berlin at a New Year&#x27;s masked ball, and began a relationship with him. Within a month she had moved in with him in a one-room studio, shared with a dancing school in Berlin-Halensee. Then they moved to Merkurstraße 3, Nowawes, in Potsdam and were married there on 26 September. They had much in common and the marriage was welcomed by both sets of parents. In the summer, Hannah Arendt successfully applied to the for a grant to support her &quot;Habilitation&quot;, which was supported by Heidegger and Jaspers among others, and in the meantime, with Günther&#x27;s help was working on revisions to get her dissertation published.

==== &quot;Wanderjahre&quot; (1929–1931) ====
After Arendt and Stern were married, they began two years of what Christian Dries refers to as the (years of wandering) with the ultimately fruitless aim of having Stern accepted for an academic appointment. They lived for a while in Drewitz, a southern neighborhood of Potsdam, before moving to Heidelberg, where they lived with the Jaspers. After Heidelberg, where Stern completed the first draft of his thesis, the two then moved to Frankfurt where Stern hoped to finish his writing. There, Arendt participated in the university&#x27;s intellectual life, attending lectures by Karl Mannheim and Paul Tillich, among others. The couple collaborated intellectually, writing an article together on Rilke&#x27;s (1923) and both reviewing Mannheim&#x27;s (1929). The latter was Arendt&#x27;s sole contribution to sociology. In both her treatment of Mannheim and Rilke, Arendt found love to be a transcendent principle &quot;Because there is no true transcendence in this ordered world, one also cannot exceed the world, but only succeed to higher ranks&quot;. In Rilke she saw a latter day secular Augustine, describing the as the (ultimate form of religious document). Later, she would discover the limitations of transcendent love in explaining the historical events that pushed her into political action. Another theme from Rilke that she would develop was the despair of not being heard. Reflecting on Rilke&#x27;s opening lines, which she placed as an epigram at the beginning of their essay
(Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angelic orders?)

Arendt and Stern begin by stating:

The paradoxical, ambiguous, and desperate situation from which standpoint the &quot;Duino Elegies&quot; may alone be understood has two characteristics: the absence of an echo and the knowledge of futility. The conscious renunciation of the demand to be heard, the despair at not being able to be heard, and finally the need to speak even without an answer–these are the real reasons for the darkness, asperity, and tension of the style in which poetry indicates its own possibilities and its will to form

Arendt also published an article on Augustine (354–430) in the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot; to mark the 1500th anniversary of his death. She saw this article as forming a bridge between her treatment of Augustine in her dissertation and her subsequent work on Romanticism. When it became evident Stern would not succeed in obtaining an appointment, the Sterns returned to Berlin in 1931.

==== Return to Berlin (1931–1933) ====
In Berlin, where the couple initially lived in the predominantly Jewish area of (Bavarian Quarter or &quot;Jewish Switzerland&quot;) in Schöneberg, Stern obtained a position as a staff-writer for the cultural supplement of the &quot;Berliner Börsen-Courier&quot;, edited by Herbert Ihering, with the help of Bertold Brecht. There he started writing using the pen name Günther Anders, i.e. &quot;Günther Other&quot;. Arendt assisted Günther with his work, but the shadow of Heidegger hung over their relationship. While Günther was working on his , Arendt had abandoned the original subject of German Romanticism for her thesis in 1930, and turned instead to Rahel Varnhagen and the question of assimilation. Anne Mendelssohn had accidentally acquired a copy of Varnhagen&#x27;s correspondence and excitedly introduced her to Arendt, donating her collection to her. A little later, Arendt&#x27;s work on Romanticism led her to a study of Jewish salons and eventually to those of Varnhagen. In Rahel, she found qualities she felt reflected her own, particularly those of sensibility and vulnerability. Rahel, like Hannah, found her destiny in her Jewishness. Hannah Arendt would come to call Rahel Varnhagen&#x27;s discovery of living with her destiny as being a &quot;conscious pariah&quot;. This was a personal trait that Arendt had recognized in herself, although she did not embrace the term until later.

Back in Berlin, Arendt found herself becoming more involved in politics and started studying political theory, and reading Marx and Trotsky, while developing contacts at the Deutsche Hochschule für Politik. Despite the political leanings of her mother and husband she never saw herself as a political leftist, justifying her activism as being through her Jewishness. Her increasing interest in Jewish politics and her examination of assimilation in her study of Varnhagen led her to publish her first article on Judaism, (&quot;The Enlightenment and the Jewish Question&quot;, 1932). Blumenfeld had introduced her to the &quot;Jewish question&quot;, which would be his lifelong concern. Meanwhile, her views on German Romanticism were evolving. She wrote a review of Hans Weil&#x27;s (&quot;The Origin of German Educational Principle&quot;, 1930), which dealt with the emergence of (educational elite) in the time of Rahel Varnhagen. At the same time she began to be occupied by Max Weber&#x27;s description of the status of Jewish people within a state as (pariah people) in his &quot;Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft&quot; (1922), while borrowing Bernard Lazare&#x27;s term &quot;paria conscient&quot; (conscious pariah) with which she identified. In both these articles she advanced the views of Johann Herder. Another interest of hers at the time was the status of women, resulting in her 1932 review of Alice Rühle-Gerstel&#x27;s book (Contemporary Women&#x27;s Issues: A psychological balance sheet). Although not a supporter of the women&#x27;s movement, the review was sympathetic. At least in terms of the status of women at that time, she was skeptical of the movement&#x27;s ability to achieve political change. She was also critical of the movement, because it was a women&#x27;s movement, rather than contributing with men to a political movement, and abstract rather than striving for concrete goals. In this manner she echoed Rosa Luxemburg. Like Luxemburg, she would later criticize Jewish movements for the same reason. Arendt consistently prioritized political over social questions.

By 1932, faced with a deteriorating political situation, Arendt was deeply troubled by reports that Heidegger was speaking at National Socialist meetings. She wrote, asking him to deny that he was attracted to National Socialism. Heidegger replied that he did not seek to deny the rumors (which were true), and merely assured her that his feelings for her were unchanged. As a Jew in Nazi Germany, Arendt was prevented from making a living and discriminated against and confided to Anne Mendelssohn that emigration was probably inevitable. Jaspers had tried to persuade her to consider herself as a German first, a position she distanced herself from, pointing out that she was a Jew and that &quot;&quot; (For me, Germany is the mother tongue, philosophy and poetry), rather than her identity. This position puzzled Jaspers, replying &quot;It is strange to me that as a Jew you want to be different from the Germans&quot;.

By 1933, life for the Jewish population in Germany was becoming precarious. Adolf Hitler became (Chancellor) in January, and the Reichstag was burned down () the following month. This led to the suspension of civil liberties, with attacks on the left, and, in particular, members of the Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (German Communist Party: KPD). Stern, who had communist associations, fled to Paris, but Arendt stayed on to become an activist. Knowing her time was limited, she used the apartment at Opitzstraße 6 in Berlin-Steglitz that she had occupied with Stern since 1932 as an underground railway way-station for fugitives. Her rescue operation there is now recognized with a plaque on the wall.
Arendt had already positioned herself as a critic of the rising Nazi Party in 1932 by publishing &quot;Adam-Müller-Renaissance?&quot; a critique of the appropriation of the life of Adam Müller to support right wing ideology. The beginnings of anti-Jewish laws and boycott came in the spring of 1933. Confronted with systemic antisemitism, Arendt adopted the &quot;motiv&quot; &quot;If one is attacked as a Jew one must defend oneself as a Jew. Not as a German, not as a world citizen, not as an upholder of the Rights of Man.&quot; This was Arendt&#x27;s introduction of the concept of Jew as Pariah that would occupy her for the rest of her life in her Jewish writings. She took a public position by publishing part of her largely completed biography of Rahel Varnhagen as &quot;&quot; (&quot;Original Assimilation: An Epilogue to the One Hundredth Anniversary of Rahel Varnhagen&#x27;s Death&quot;) in the on 7 March 1933 and a little later also in . In the article she argues that the age of assimilation that began with Varnhagen&#x27;s generation had come to an end with an official state policy of antisemitism. She opened with the declaration:

Today in Germany it seems Jewish &quot;assimilation&quot; must declare its bankruptcy. The general social antisemitism and its official legitimation affects in the first instance assimilated Jews, who can no longer protect themselves through baptism or by emphasizing their differences from Eastern Judaism.

As a Jew, Arendt was anxious to inform the world of what was happening to her people in 1930–1933. She surrounded herself with Zionist activists, including Kurt Blumenfeld, Martin Buber and Salman Schocken, and started to research antisemitism. Arendt had access to the Prussian State Library for her work on Varnhagen. Blumenfeld&#x27;s &quot;Zionistische Vereinigung für Deutschland&quot; (Zionist Federation of Germany) persuaded her to use this access to obtain evidence of the extent of antisemitism, for a planned speech to the Zionist Congress in Prague. This research was illegal at the time. Her actions led to her being denounced by a librarian for anti-state propaganda, resulting in the arrest of both Arendt and her mother by the &quot;Gestapo&quot;. They served eight days in prison but her notebooks were in code and could not be deciphered, and she was released by a young, sympathetic arresting officer to await trial. This incident is the subject of the play &quot;Mrs. Stern Wanders the Prussian State Library&quot;, by Jenny Lyn Bader, which premiered in 2019 in West Orange, New Jersey.

=== Exile: France (1933–1941) ===

==== Paris (1933–1940) ====

On release, realizing the danger she was now in, Arendt and her mother fled Germany following the established escape route over the Ore Mountains by night into Czechoslovakia and on to Prague and then by train to Geneva. In Geneva, she made a conscious decision to commit herself to &quot;the Jewish cause&quot;. She obtained work with a friend of her mother&#x27;s at the League of Nations&#x27; Jewish Agency for Palestine, distributing visas and writing speeches.

From Geneva the Arendts traveled to Paris in the autumn, where she was reunited with Stern, joining a stream of refugees. While Arendt had left Germany without papers, her mother had travel documents and returned to Königsberg and her husband. In Paris, she befriended Stern&#x27;s cousin, the Marxist literary critic and philosopher Walter Benjamin and also the Jewish French philosopher Raymond Aron.

Arendt was now an &quot;émigrée&quot;, an exile, stateless, without papers, and had turned her back on the Germany and Germans of the . Her legal status was precarious and she was coping with a foreign language and culture, all of which took its toll on her mentally and physically. In 1934 she started working for the Zionist-funded outreach program Agriculture et Artisanat, giving lectures and organizing clothing, documents, medications and education for Jewish youth seeking to emigrate to the British Mandate of Palestine, mainly as agricultural workers. Initially she was employed as a secretary, and then office manager. To improve her skills she studied French, Hebrew, and Yiddish. In this way she was able to support herself and her husband. When the organization closed in 1935, her work for Blumenfeld and the Zionists in Germany brought her into contact with the wealthy philanthropist Baroness Germaine Alice de Rothschild (born Halphen, 1884–1975), wife of Édouard Alphonse James de Rothschild, becoming her assistant. In this position she oversaw the baroness&#x27; contributions to Jewish charities through the Paris Consistoire, although she had little time for the family as a whole.

Later in 1935, Arendt joined Youth Aliyah (Youth immigration), an organization similar to Agriculture et Artisanat that was founded in Berlin on the day Hitler seized power. It was affiliated with Hadassah, which later saved many from the Holocaust, and there Arendt eventually became Secretary-General (1935–1939). Her work with Youth Aliyah also involved finding food, clothing, social workers, and lawyers, but above all, fund raising. She made her first visit to British Mandate of Palestine in 1935, accompanying one of these groups and meeting with her cousin Ernst Fürst there. With the Nazi annexation of Austria and invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938, Paris was flooded with refugees, and she became the special agent for the rescue of the children from those countries. In 1938, Arendt completed her biography of Rahel Varnhagen, although this was not published until 1957. In April 1939, following the devastating &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; pogrom of November 1938, Martha Beerwald realized her daughter would not return and made the decision to leave her husband and join Arendt in Paris. One stepdaughter had died and the other had moved to England, Martin Beerwald would not leave and she no longer had any close ties to Königsberg.

===== Heinrich Blücher =====
In 1936, Arendt met the self-educated Berlin poet and Marxist philosopher Heinrich Blücher in Paris. Blücher had been a Spartacist and then a founding member of the KPD, but had been expelled due to his work in the (Conciliator faction). Although Arendt had rejoined Stern in 1933, their marriage existed in name only, with their having separated in Berlin. She fulfilled her social obligations and used the name Hannah Stern, but the relationship effectively ended when Stern, perhaps recognizing the danger better than she, emigrated to America with his parents in 1936. In 1937, Arendt was stripped of her German citizenship and she and Stern divorced. She had begun seeing more of Blücher, and eventually they began living together. It was Blücher&#x27;s long political activism that began to move Arendt&#x27;s thinking toward political action. Arendt and Blücher married on 16 January 1940, shortly after their divorces were finalized.

==== Internment and escape (1940–1941) ====

On 5 May 1940, in anticipation of the German invasion of France and the Low Countries that month, the military governor of Paris issued a proclamation ordering all &quot;enemy aliens&quot; between 17 and 55 who had come from Germany (predominantly Jews) to report separately for internment. The women were gathered together in the Vélodrome d&#x27;Hiver on 15 May, so Hannah Arendt&#x27;s mother, being older than 55, was allowed to stay in Paris. Arendt described the process of making refugees as &quot;the new type of human being created by contemporary history ... put into concentration camps by their foes and into internment camps by their friends&quot;. The men, including Blücher, were sent to Camp Vernet in southern France, close to the Spanish border. Arendt and the other women were sent to Camp Gurs, to the west of Gurs, a week later. The camp had earlier been set up to accommodate refugees from Spain. On 22 June, France capitulated and signed the Compiègne armistice, dividing the country. Gurs was in the southern Vichy controlled section. Arendt describes how, &quot;in the resulting chaos we succeeded in getting hold of liberation papers with which we were able to leave the camp&quot;, which she did with approximately 200 of the 7,000 women held there, about four weeks later. There was no Résistance then, but she managed to walk and hitchhike north to Montauban, near Toulouse where she knew she would find help.

Montauban had become an unofficial capital for former detainees, and Arendt&#x27;s friend Lotta Sempell Klembort was staying there. Blücher&#x27;s camp had been evacuated in the wake of the German advance, and he managed to escape from a forced march, making his way to Montauban, where the two of them led a fugitive life. Soon they were joined by Anne Mendelssohn and Arendt&#x27;s mother. Escape from France was extremely difficult without official papers; their friend Walter Benjamin had taken his own life after being apprehended trying to escape to Spain. One of the best-known illegal routes operated out of Marseille, where Varian Fry, an American journalist, worked to raise funds, forge papers, and bribe officials with Hiram Bingham, the American vice-consul there.

Fry and Bingham secured exit papers and American visas for thousands, and with help from Günther Stern, Arendt, her husband, and her mother managed to secure the requisite permits to travel by train in January 1941 through Spain to Lisbon, Portugal, where they rented a flat at Rua da Sociedade Farmacêutica, 6b. They eventually secured passage to New York in May on the Companhia Colonial de Navegação&#x27;s S/S &quot;Guiné II&quot;. A few months later, Fry&#x27;s operations were shut down and the borders sealed.

=== New York (1941–1975) ===

==== World War II (1941–1945) ====
Upon arriving in New York City on 22 May 1941 with very little, Hannah&#x27;s family received assistance from the Zionist Organization of America and the local German immigrant population, including Paul Tillich and neighbors from Königsberg. They rented rooms at 317 West 95th Street and Martha Arendt joined them there in June. There was an urgent need to acquire English, and it was decided that Hannah Arendt should spend two months with an American family in Winchester, Massachusetts, through Self-Help for Refugees, in July. She found the experience difficult but formulated her early appraisal of American life, (The fundamental contradiction of the country is political freedom coupled with social slavery).

On returning to New York, Arendt was anxious to resume writing and became active in the German-Jewish community, publishing her first article, &quot;From the Dreyfus Affair to France Today&quot; (in translation from her German) in July 1941. While she was working on this article, she was looking for employment and in November 1941 was hired by the New York German-language Jewish newspaper &quot;&quot; and from 1941 to 1945, she wrote a political column for it, covering antisemitism, refugees and the need for a Jewish army. She also contributed to the &quot;Menorah Journal&quot;, a Jewish-American magazine, and other German &quot;émigré&quot; publications.
Arendt&#x27;s first full-time salaried job came in 1944, when she became the director of research and executive director for the newly emerging Commission on European Jewish Cultural Reconstruction, a project of the Conference on Jewish Relations. She was recruited &quot;because of her great interest in the Commission&#x27;s activities, her previous experience as an administrator, and her connections with Germany&quot;. There she compiled lists of Jewish cultural assets in Germany and Nazi occupied Europe, to aid in their recovery after the war. Together with her husband, she lived at 370 Riverside Drive in New York City and at Kingston, New York, where Blücher taught at nearby Bard College for many years.

==== Post-war (1945–1975) ====

In July 1946, Arendt left her position at the Commission on European Jewish Cultural Reconstruction to become an editor at Schocken Books, which later published some of her works. In 1948, she became engaged with the campaign of Judah Magnes for a solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. She famously opposed the establishment of a Jewish nation-state in Palestine and initially also opposed the establishment of a binational Arab-Jewish state. Instead, she advocated for the inclusion of Palestine into a multi-ethnic federation. Only in 1948 in an effort to forestall partition did she support a binational one-state solution. She returned to the Commission in August 1949. In her capacity as executive secretary, she traveled to Europe, where she worked in Germany, Britain, and France (December 1949 to March 1950) to negotiate the return of archival material from German institutions, an experience she found frustrating, but provided regular field reports. In January 1952, she became secretary to the Board, although the work of the organization was winding down and she was simultaneously pursuing her own intellectual activities; she retained this position until her death. Arendt&#x27;s work on cultural restitution provided further material for her study of totalitarianism.

In the 1950s Arendt published &quot;The Origins of Totalitarianism&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Human Condition&quot; (1958), followed by &quot;On Revolution&quot; (1963). Arendt became a naturalized citizen of the United States on December 10, 1951. Arendt had begun corresponding with the American author Mary McCarthy, six years her junior, in 1950 and they soon became lifelong friends. She had started seeing Martin Heidegger again, and had what the American writer Adam Kirsch called a &quot;quasi-romance&quot;, lasting for two years, with the man who had previously been her mentor, teacher, and lover. During this time, Arendt defended him against critics who noted his enthusiastic membership in the Nazi Party. She portrayed Heidegger as a naïve man swept up by forces beyond his control, and pointed out that Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy had nothing to do with National Socialism. She suspected that loyal followers of Horkheimer and Adorno in Frankfurt were plotting against Heidegger. For Adorno she had a real aversion: &quot;Half a Jew and one of the most repugnant men I know&quot;. According to Arendt, the Frankfurt School was willing, and quite capable of doing so, to destroy Heidegger: &quot;For years they have branded anti-Semitism on anyone in Germany who opposes them, or have threatened to raise such an accusation&quot;.

In 1961 she traveled to Jerusalem to report on Eichmann&#x27;s trial for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. This report strongly influenced her popular recognition, and raised much controversy (&quot;see below&quot;). Her work was recognized by many awards, including the Danish Sonning Prize in 1975 for Contributions to European Civilization.

A few years later she spoke in New York City on the legitimacy of violence as a political act: &quot;Generally speaking, violence always rises out of impotence. It is the hope of those who have no power to find a substitute for it and this hope, I think, is in vain. Violence can destroy power, but it can never replace it.&quot;

===== Teaching =====

Arendt taught at many institutions of higher learning from 1951 onward, but, preserving her independence, consistently refused tenure-track positions. She was a visiting scholar at the University of Notre Dame, University of California, Berkeley, Princeton University (where she was the first woman to be appointed a full professor in 1959) and Northwestern University. She also taught at the University of Chicago from 1963 to 1967, where she was a member of the Committee on Social Thought, Yale University, where she was a fellow and the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University (1961–62, 1962–63). From 1967 she was a professor at the New School for Social research in Manhattan, New York City.

She was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1962 and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1964. In 1974, Arendt was instrumental in the creation of Structured Liberal Education (SLE) at Stanford University. She wrote a letter to the president of Stanford to persuade the university to enact Stanford history professor Mark Mancall&#x27;s vision of a residentially-based humanities program. At the time of her death, she was University Professor of Political Philosophy at The New School.

== Relationships ==

In addition to her affair with Heidegger, and her two marriages, Arendt had close friendships. Since her death, her correspondence with many of them has been published, revealing much information about her thinking. To her friends she was both loyal and generous, dedicating several of her works to them. (friendship) she described as being one of &quot;&quot; (the active modes of being alive), and, to her, friendship was central both to her life and to the concept of politics. Hans Jonas described her as having a &quot;genius for friendship&quot;, and, in her own words, &quot; (love of friendship).

Her philosophy-based friendships were male and European, while her later American friendships were more diverse, literary, and political. Although she became an American citizen in 1950, her cultural roots remained European, and her language remained her German &quot; (mother tongue). She surrounded herself with German-speaking &quot;émigrés&quot;, sometimes referred to as &quot;The Tribe&quot;. To her, (real people) were &quot;pariahs&quot;, not in the sense of outcasts, but in the sense of outsiders, unassimilated, with the virtue of &quot;social nonconformism ... the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of intellectual achievement&quot;, a sentiment she shared with Jaspers.

Arendt always had a (best friend [female]). In her teens she had formed a lifelong relationship with her , Anne Mendelssohn Weil (&quot;Ännchen&quot;). After she emigrated to America, Hilde Fränkel, Paul Tillich&#x27;s secretary and mistress, filled that role until the latter died in 1950. After the war, Arendt was able to return to Germany and renew her relationship with Weil, who made several visits to New York, especially after Blücher&#x27;s death in 1970. Their last meeting was in Tegna, Switzerland in 1975, shortly before Arendt&#x27;s death. With Fränkel&#x27;s death, Mary McCarthy became Arendt&#x27;s closest friend and confidante.

== Final illness and death ==

Heinrich Blücher had survived a cerebral aneurysm in 1961 and remained unwell after 1963, sustaining a series of heart attacks. On 31 October 1970, he died of a massive heart attack. A devastated Arendt had previously told Mary McCarthy, &quot;Life without him would be unthinkable&quot;. Arendt was also a heavy smoker and was frequently depicted with a cigarette in her hand. She sustained a near-fatal heart attack while lecturing in Scotland in May 1974, and although she recovered, she remained in poor health afterward and continued to smoke. On the evening of 4 December 1975, shortly after her 69th birthday, she had a further heart attack in her apartment while entertaining friends, and was pronounced dead at the scene. Her ashes were buried alongside those of Blücher at Bard College, in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York in May 1976.

After Arendt&#x27;s death the title page of the final part of &quot;The Life of the Mind&quot; (&quot;Judging&quot;) was found in her typewriter, which she had just started, consisting of the title and two epigraphs. This has subsequently been reproduced in the edited version of her &quot;Lectures on Kant&#x27;s Political Philosophy&quot;.(&quot;see image&quot;).

== Work ==
Arendt wrote works on intellectual history as a political theorist, using events and actions to develop insights into contemporary totalitarian movements and the threat to human freedom presented by scientific abstraction and bourgeois morality. Intellectually, she was an independent thinker, a loner, not a &quot;joiner&quot;, separating herself from schools of thought or ideology. In addition to her major texts she published anthologies, including &quot;Between Past and Future&quot; (1961), &quot;Men in Dark Times&quot; (1968), and &quot;Crises of the Republic&quot; (1972). She also contributed to many publications, including &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;Commonweal&quot;, &quot;Dissent&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. She is perhaps best known for her accounts of Adolf Eichmann and his trial, because of the intense controversy that it generated.

=== Political theory and philosophical system ===
While Arendt never developed a systematic political theory and her writing does not easily lend itself to categorization, the tradition of thought most closely identified with Arendt is that of civic republicanism, from Aristotle to Tocqueville. Her political concept is centered around active citizenship that emphasizes civic engagement and collective deliberation. She believed that no matter how bad, government could never succeed in extinguishing human freedom, despite holding that modern societies frequently retreat from democratic freedom with its inherent disorder for the relative comfort of administrative bureaucracy. Some have claimed her political legacy is her strong defence of freedom in the face of an increasingly less than free world. She does not adhere to a single systematic philosophy, but rather spans a range of subjects covering totalitarianism, revolution, the nature of freedom, and the faculties of thought and judgment.

While she is best known for her work on &quot;dark times&quot;, the nature of totalitarianism and evil, she imbued this with a spark of hope and confidence in the nature of Mankind:

That even in the darkest of times we have the right to expect some illumination, and that such illumination might well come less from theories and concepts than from the uncertain, flickering, and often weak light that some men and women, in their lives and their works, will kindle under almost all circumstances and shed over the time span that was given to them. &quot;Men in Dark Times&quot; (1968)

=== &quot;Love and Saint Augustine&quot; (1929) ===

Arendt&#x27;s doctoral thesis, (&quot;Love and Saint Augustine. Towards a philosophical interpretation&quot;), was published in 1929 and attracted critical interest, although an English translation did not appear until 1996. In this work she combined approaches of both Heidegger and Jaspers. Arendt&#x27;s interpretation of love in the work of Augustine deals with three concepts, love as craving or desire (&quot;Amor qua appetitus&quot;), love in the relationship between man (&quot;creatura&quot;) and creator (&quot;Creator – Creatura&quot;), and neighborly love (&quot;Dilectio proximi&quot;). Love as craving anticipates the future, while love for the Creator deals with the remembered past. Of the three, &quot;dilectio proximi&quot; or &quot;caritas&quot; is perceived as the most fundamental, to which the first two are oriented, which she treats as &quot;vita socialis&quot; (social life) – the second of the Great Commandments (or Golden Rule) &quot;Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself&quot; uniting and transcending the former. Augustine&#x27;s influence (and Jaspers&#x27; views on his work) persisted in Arendt&#x27;s writings for the rest of her life.

Some of the &quot;leitmotifs&quot; of her canon were apparent, introducing the concept of (Natality) as a key condition of human existence and its role in the development of the individual, developing this further in &quot;The Human Condition&quot; (1958). She explained that the construct of natality was implied in her discussion of new beginnings and Man&#x27;s elation to the Creator as &quot;nova creatura&quot;. The centrality of the theme of birth and renewal is apparent in the constant reference to Augustinian thought, and specifically the innovative nature of birth, from this, her first work, to her last, &quot;The Life of the Mind&quot;.

Love is another connecting theme. In addition to the Augustinian loves expostulated in her dissertation, the phrase &quot;amor mundi&quot; (love of the world) is one often associated with Arendt and both permeates her work and was an absorbing passion throughout her work. She took the phrase from Augustine&#x27;s homily on the first epistle of St John, &quot;If love of the world dwell in us&quot;. &quot;Amor mundi&quot; was her original title for &quot;The Human Condition&quot; (1958), the subtitle of Elisabeth Young-Bruehl&#x27;s biography (1982), the title of a collection of writing on faith in her work and is the newsletter of the Hannah Arendt Center at Bard College.

=== &quot;The Origins of Totalitarianism&quot; (1951) ===

Arendt&#x27;s first major book, &quot;The Origins of Totalitarianism&quot; (1951), examined the roots of Stalinism and Nazism, structured as three essays, &quot;Antisemitism&quot;, &quot;Imperialism&quot;, and &quot;Totalitarianism&quot;. Arendt argues that totalitarianism was a &quot;novel form of government,&quot; that &quot;differs essentially from other forms of political oppression known to us such as despotism, tyranny and dictatorship&quot; in that it applied terror to subjugate mass populations rather than just political adversaries. Arendt also maintained that Jewry was not the operative factor in the Holocaust, but merely a convenient proxy because Nazism was about terror and consistency, not merely eradicating Jews. Arendt explained the tyranny using Kant&#x27;s phrase &quot;radical evil&quot;, by which their victims became &quot;superfluous people&quot;. In later editions she enlarged the text to include her work on &quot;Ideology and Terror: A novel form of government&quot; and the Hungarian Revolution, but then published the latter separately.

Criticism of &quot;Origins&quot; has often focused on its portrayal of the two movements, Hitlerism and Stalinism, as equally tyrannical.

=== &quot;Rahel Varnhagen: The Life of a Jewess&quot; (1957) ===
Arendt&#x27;s on Rahel Varnhagen was completed while she was living in exile in Paris in 1938, but not published till 1957, in the United Kingdom by East and West Library, part of the Leo Baeck Institute. This biography of a nineteenth-century Jewish socialite formed an important step in her analysis of Jewish history and the subjects of assimilation and emancipation, and introduced her treatment of the Jewish diaspora as either &quot;pariah&quot; or &quot;parvenu&quot;. In addition it represents an early version of her concept of history. The book is dedicated to Anne Mendelssohn, who first drew her attention to Varnhagen. Arendt&#x27;s relation to Varnhagen permeates her subsequent work. Her account of Varnhagen&#x27;s life was perceived during a time of the destruction of German-Jewish culture. It partially reflects Arendt&#x27;s own view of herself as a German-Jewish woman driven out of her own culture into a stateless existence, leading to the description &quot;biography as autobiography&quot;.

=== &quot;The Human Condition&quot; (1958) ===

In what is arguably her most influential work, &quot;The Human Condition&quot; (1958), Arendt differentiates political and social concepts, labor and work, and various forms of actions; she then explores the implications of those distinctions. Her theory of political action, corresponding to the existence of a public realm, is extensively developed in this work. Arendt argues that, while human life always evolves within societies, the social part of human nature, political life, has been intentionally realized in only a few societies as a space for individuals to achieve freedom. Conceptual categories, which attempt to bridge the gap between ontological and sociological structures, are sharply delineated. While Arendt relegates labor and work to the realm of the social, she favors the human condition of action as that which is both existential and aesthetic. Of human actions, Arendt identifies two that she considers essential. These are forgiving past wrong (or unfixing the fixed past) and promising future benefit (or fixing the unfixed future).

Arendt had first introduced the concept of &quot;natality&quot; in her &quot;Love and Saint Augustine&quot; (1929) and in &quot;The Human Condition&quot; starts to develop this further. In this, she departs from Heidegger&#x27;s emphasis on mortality. Arendt&#x27;s positive message is one of the &quot;miracle of beginning&quot;, the continual arrival of the new to create action, that is to alter the state of affairs brought about by previous actions. &quot;Men&quot;, she wrote &quot;though they must die, are not born in order to die but in order to begin&quot;. She defined her use of &quot;natality&quot; as:

The miracle that saves the world, the realm of human affairs, from its normal, &quot;natural&quot; ruin is ultimately the fact of natality, in which the faculty of action is ontologically rooted. It is, in other words, the birth of new men and the new beginning, the action they are capable of by virtue of being born.

Natality would go on to become a central concept of her political theory, and also what Karin Fry considers its most optimistic one.

=== &quot;Between Past and Future&quot; (1954...1968) ===

&quot;Between Past and Future&quot; is an anthology of eight essays written between 1954 and 1968, dealing with a variety of different but connected philosophical subjects. These essays share the central idea that humans live between the past and the uncertain future. Man must permanently think to exist, but must learn thinking. Humans have resorted to tradition, but are abandoning respect for this tradition and culture. Arendt tries to find solutions to help humans think again, since modern philosophy has not succeeded in helping humans to live correctly.

=== &quot;On Revolution&quot; (1963) ===

Arendt&#x27;s book &quot;On Revolution&quot; presents a comparison of two of the main revolutions of the 18th century, the American and French Revolutions. She goes against a common impression of both Marxist and leftist views when she argues that France, while well-studied and often emulated, was a disaster and that the largely ignored American Revolution was a success. The turning point in the French Revolution occurred when the leaders rejected their goals of freedom to focus on compassion for the masses. In the United States, the founders never betray the goal of &quot;&quot;. Arendt believes the revolutionary spirit of those men had been lost, however, and advocates a &quot;council system&quot; as an appropriate institution to regain that spirit.

=== &quot;Men in Dark Times&quot; (1968) ===
The anthology of essays &quot;Men in Dark Times&quot; presents intellectual biographies of some creative and moral figures of the 20th century, such as Walter Benjamin, Karl Jaspers, Rosa Luxemburg, Hermann Broch, Pope John XXIII, and Isak Dinesen.

=== &quot;Crises of the Republic&quot; (1972) ===

&quot;Crises of the Republic&quot; was the third of Arendt&#x27;s anthologies, consisting of four essays. These related essays deal with contemporary American politics and the crises it faced in the 1960s and 1970s. &quot;Lying in Politics&quot; looks for an explanation behind the administration&#x27;s deception regarding the Vietnam War, as revealed in the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;. &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot; examines the opposition movements, while the final &quot;Thoughts on Politics and Revolution&quot; is a commentary, in the form of an interview on the third essay, &quot;On Violence&quot;. In &quot;On Violence&quot; Arendt substantiates that violence presupposes power which she understands as a property of groups. Thus, she breaks with the predominant conception of power as derived from violence.

=== &quot;The Life of the Mind&quot; (1978) ===
Arendt&#x27;s last major work, &quot;The Life of the Mind&quot; remained incomplete at the time of her death in 1975, but marked a return to moral philosophy. The outline of the book was based on her graduate level political philosophy class, &quot;Philosophy of the Mind&quot;, and her Gifford Lectures in Scotland. She conceived of the work as a trilogy based on the mental activities of thinking, willing, and judging. Her most recent work had focused on the first two, but went beyond this in terms of &quot;&quot;. Her discussion of thinking was based on Socrates and his notion of thinking as a solitary dialogue between oneself, leading her to novel concepts of conscience.

Arendt died suddenly five days after completing the second part, with the first page of Judging still in her typewriter, and McCarthy then edited the first two parts and provided some indication of the direction of the third. Arendt&#x27;s exact intentions for the third part are unknown but she left several manuscripts (such as &quot;Thinking and Moral Considerations&quot;, &quot;Some Questions on Moral Philosophy&quot; and &quot;Lectures on Kant&#x27;s Political Philosophy&quot;) relating to her thoughts on the mental faculty of Judging. These have since been published separately.

=== Collected works ===
After Arendt died in 1975, her essays and notes have continued to be collected, edited and published posthumously by friends and colleagues, mainly under the editorship of Jerome Kohn, including those that give some insight into the unfinished third part of &quot;The Life of the Mind&quot;. Some dealt with her Jewish identity. &quot;The Jew as Pariah: Jewish Identity and Politics in the Modern Age&quot; (1978), is a collection of 15 essays and letters from the period 1943–1966 on the situation of Jews in modern times, to try and throw some light on her views on the Jewish world, following the backlash to &quot;Eichmann&quot;, but proved to be equally polarizing. A further collection of her writings on being Jewish was published as &quot;The Jewish Writings&quot; (2007). Her work on moral philosophy appeared as &quot;Lectures on Kant&#x27;s Political Philosophy&quot; (1982) and &quot;Responsibility and Judgment&quot; (2003), and her literary works as &quot;Reflections on Literature and Culture&quot; (2007).

Other work includes the collection of forty, largely fugitive, essays, addresses, and reviews covering the period 1930–1954, entitled &quot;Essays in Understanding 1930–1954: Formation, Exile, and Totalitarianism&quot; (1994). These presaged her monumental &quot;The Origins of Totalitarianism&quot;, in particular &quot;On the Nature of Totalitarianism&quot; (1953) and &quot;The Concern with Politics in Contemporary European Philosophical Thought&quot; (1954). However these attracted little attention. However after a new version of &quot;Origins of Totalitarianism&quot; appeared in 2004 followed by &quot;The Promise of Politics&quot; in 2005 there appeared a new interest in Arendtiana. This led to a second series of her remaining essays, &quot;Thinking Without a Banister: Essays in Understanding, 1953–1975&quot;, published in 2018. Her notebooks which form a series of memoirs, were published as in 2002.

=== Poetry ===
Arendt began writing poetry in her adolescence, but it was intensly personal and few knew of the existence of her poems till her archives at the Library of Congress were made accessible by McCarthy in 1988. She began collecting them in 1923 and they were one of the few things she took with her on her flight from Berlin and her subsequent escape to the United States. They remained unpublished in her lifetime, although she had typed, edited and bound them after she arrived in New York and they were rediscovered at the library by Samantha Rose Hill in 2011. The early poems that she brought with her were deposited with her papers in the library. Other later poems were found in notebooks in the German Literature Archive, Marbach, Germany, where she had placed them just before her death in 1975. Some further poems were found in her correspondence with Heidegger, Blücher and Broch.

It was not till 2025 that her seventy-one collected poems spanning a period from 1923-1961 were first published in a bilingual German-English edition.

=== Correspondence ===
Some further insight into her thinking is provided in the continuing posthumous publication of her correspondence with many of the important figures in her life, including Karl Jaspers (1992), Mary McCarthy (1995), Heinrich Blücher (1996), Martin Heidegger (2004), Alfred Kazin (2005), Walter Benjamin (2006), Gershom Scholem (2011) and Günther Stern (2016). Other correspondences that have been published include those with women friends such as Hilde Fränkel and Anne Mendelssohnn Weil (&quot;see&quot; Relationships).

=== Arendt and the Eichmann trial (1961–1963) ===
In 1960, on hearing of Adolf Eichmann&#x27;s capture and plans for his trial, Hannah Arendt contacted &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and offered to travel to Israel to cover it when it opened on 11 April 1961. Arendt was anxious to test her theories, developed in &quot;The Origins of Totalitarianism&quot;, and see how justice would be administered to the sort of man she had written about. Also she had witnessed &quot;little of the Nazi regime directly&quot; and this was an opportunity to witness an agent of totalitarianism first hand. The offer was accepted and she attended six weeks of the five-month trial with her young Israeli cousin, . On arrival she was treated as a celebrity, meeting with the trial chief judge, Moshe Landau, and the foreign minister, Golda Meir. In her subsequent 1963 report, based on her observations and transcripts, and which evolved into the book &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil&quot;, Arendt coined the phrase &quot;the banality of evil&quot; to describe the Eichmann phenomenon. She, like others, was struck by his very ordinariness and the demeanor he exhibited of a small, slightly balding, bland bureaucrat, in contrast to the horrific crimes he stood accused of. He was, she wrote, &quot;terribly and terrifyingly normal.&quot; She examined the question of whether evil is radical or simply a function of thoughtlessness, a tendency of ordinary people to obey orders and conform to mass opinion without a critical evaluation of the consequences of their actions. Arendt&#x27;s argument was that Eichmann was not a monster, contrasting the immensity of his actions with the very ordinariness of the man himself. Eichmann, she stated, not only called himself a Zionist, having initially opposed the Jewish persecution, but also expected his captors to understand him. She pointed out that his actions were not driven by malice, but rather blind dedication to the regime and his need to belong, to be a &quot;joiner.&quot;

On this, Arendt would later state &quot;Going along with the rest and wanting to say &#x27;we&#x27; were quite enough to make the greatest of all crimes possible&quot;. What Arendt observed during the trial was a bourgeois sales clerk who found a meaningful role for himself and a sense of importance in the Nazi movement. She noted that his addiction to clichés and use of bureaucratic morality clouded his ability to question his actions, &quot;to think&quot;. This led her to set out her most debated dictum: &quot;the lesson that this long course in human wickedness had taught us – the lesson of the fearsome, word-and-thought-defying banality of evil.&quot; By stating that Eichmann did not think, she did not imply lack of conscious awareness of his actions, but by &quot;thinking&quot; she implied reflective rationality, that was lacking.

Arendt was critical of the way the trial was conducted by the Israelis as a &quot;show trial&quot; with ulterior motives other than simply trying evidence and administering justice. Arendt was also critical of the way Israel depicted Eichmann&#x27;s crimes as crimes against a nation-state, rather than against humanity itself. She objected to the idea that a strong Israel was necessary to protect world Jewry being again placed where &quot;they&#x27;ll let themselves be slaughtered like sheep,&quot; recalling the biblical phrase. She portrayed the prosecutor, Attorney General Gideon Hausner, as employing hyperbolic rhetoric in the pursuit of Prime Minister Ben-Gurion&#x27;s political agenda. Arendt, who believed she could maintain her focus on moral principles in the face of outrage, became increasingly frustrated with Hausner, describing his parade of survivors as having &quot;no apparent bearing on the case&quot;. She was particularly concerned that Hausner repeatedly asked &quot;why did you not rebel?&quot; rather than question the role of the Jewish leaders. On this point, Arendt argued that during the Holocaust some of them cooperated with Eichmann &quot;almost without exception&quot; in the destruction of their own people. These leaders, notably M. C. Rumkowski, constituted the Jewish Councils (Judenräte). She had expressed concerns on this point prior to the trial. She described this as a moral catastrophe. While her argument was not to allocate blame, rather she mourned what she considered a moral failure of compromising the imperative that it is better to suffer wrong than to do wrong. She describes the cooperation of the Jewish leaders in terms of a disintegration of Jewish morality: &quot;This role of the Jewish leaders in the destruction of their own people is undoubtedly the darkest chapter in the whole dark story&quot;. Widely misunderstood, this caused an even greater controversy and particularly animosity toward her in the Jewish community and in Israel. For Arendt, the Eichmann trial marked a turning point in her thinking in the final decade of her life, becoming increasingly preoccupied with moral philosophy.

==== Reception ====
Arendt&#x27;s five-part series &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot; appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in February 1963 some nine months after Eichmann was hanged on 31 May 1962. By this time his trial was largely forgotten in the popular mind, superseded by intervening world events. However, no other account of either Eichmann or National Socialism has aroused so much controversy. Before its publication, Arendt was considered a brilliant humanistic original political thinker. Her mentor, Karl Jaspers, however, had warned her about a possible adverse outcome, &quot;The Eichmann trial will be no pleasure for you. I&#x27;m afraid it cannot go well&quot;. On publication, three controversies immediately occupied public attention: the concept of Eichmann as banal, her criticism of the role of Israel and her description of the role played by the Jewish people themselves.

Arendt was profoundly shocked by the response, writing to Karl Jaspers &quot;People are resorting to any means to destroy my reputation ... They have spent weeks trying to find something in my past that they can hang on me&quot;. Now she was being called arrogant, heartless and ill-informed. She was accused of being duped by Eichmann, of being a &quot;self-hating Jewess&quot;, and even an enemy of Israel. Her critics included the Anti-Defamation League and many other Jewish groups, editors of publications she was a contributor to, faculty at the universities she taught at, and friends from all parts of her life. Her friend Gershom Scholem, a major scholar of Jewish mysticism, broke off relations with her, publishing their correspondence without her permission. Arendt was criticized by many Jewish public figures, who charged her with coldness and lack of sympathy for the victims of the Holocaust. Because of this lingering criticism, neither this book nor any of her other works were translated into Hebrew until 1999. Arendt responded to the controversies in the book&#x27;s postscript.

Although Arendt complained that she was being criticized for telling the truth – &quot;what a risky business to tell the truth on a factual level without theoretical and scholarly embroidery&quot; – the criticism was largely directed to her theorizing on the nature of mankind and evil and that ordinary people were driven to commit the inexplicable not so much by hatred and ideology as ambition, and inability to empathize. Equally problematic was the suggestion that the victims deceived themselves and complied in their own destruction. Prior to Arendt&#x27;s depiction of Eichmann, his popular image had been, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; put it &quot;the most evil monster of humanity&quot; and as a representative of &quot;an atrocious crime, unparalleled in history&quot;, &quot;the extermination of European Jews&quot;. As it turned out Arendt and others were correct in pointing out that Eichmann&#x27;s characterization by the prosecution as the architect and chief technician of the Holocaust was not entirely credible.

While much has been made of Arendt&#x27;s treatment of Eichmann, Ada Ushpiz, in her 2015 documentary &quot;Vita Activa: The Spirit of Hannah Arendt&quot;, placed it in a much broader context of the use of rationality to explain seemingly irrational historical events.

==== &quot;Kein Mensch hat das Recht zu gehorchen&quot; ====

In an interview with Joachim Fest in 1964, Arendt was asked about Eichmann&#x27;s defense that he had made Kant&#x27;s principle of the duty of obedience his guiding principle all his life. Arendt replied that that was outrageous and that Eichmann was misusing Kant, by not considering the element of judgement required in assessing one&#x27;s own actions – &quot; (No man has, according to Kant, the right to obey), she stated, paraphrasing Kant. The reference was to Kant&#x27;s (Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason 1793) in which he states:

 (The saying, &quot;We must hearken to God, rather than to man&quot;,&quot; signifies no more than this, viz. that should any earthly legislation enjoin something immediately contradictory of the moral law, obedience is not to be rendered)

Kant clearly defines a higher moral duty than rendering merely unto Caesar. Arendt herself had written in her book &quot;This was outrageous, on the face of it, and also incomprehensible, since Kant&#x27;s moral philosophy is so closely bound up with man&#x27;s faculty of judgment, which rules out blind obedience.&quot; Arendt&#x27;s reply to Fest was subsequently corrupted to read (No one has the right to obey), which has been widely reproduced, although it does encapsulate an aspect of her moral philosophy.

The phrase has become one of her iconic images, appearing on the wall of the house in which she was born (&quot;see&quot; Commemorations), among other places. A fascist bas-relief on the Palazzo degli Uffici Finanziari (1942), in the Piazza del Tribunale, Bolzano, Italy celebrating Mussolini, read &quot;Credere, Obbedire, Combattere&quot; (Believe, Obey, Combat). In 2017 it was altered to read Hannah Arendt&#x27;s original words on obedience in the three official languages of the region.

The phrase has been appearing in other artistic work featuring political messages, such as the 2015 installation by Wilfried Gerstel, which has evoked the concept of resistance to dictatorship, as expressed in her essay &quot;Personal Responsibility under Dictatorship&quot; (1964).

== Views ==
In 1961, while covering the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem, Arendt wrote a letter to Karl Jaspers that Adam Kirsch described as reflecting &quot;pure racism&quot; toward Sephardic Jews from the Middle East and Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe. She wrote:

Fortunately, Eichmann&#x27;s three judges were of German origin, indeed the best of German Jewry. [Attorney General Gideon] Hausner is a typical Galician Jew, still European, very unsympathetic... boring... constantly making mistakes. Probably one of those people who don&#x27;t know any language. Everything is organized by a police force which gives me the creeps, speaks only Hebrew, and looks Arabic. Some downright brutal types among them. They would obey any order. And outside the doors, the oriental mob, as if one were in Istanbul or some other half-Asiatic country.

Although Arendt remained a Zionist both during and after World War II, she made it clear that she favored the creation of a Jewish-Arab federated state in British Mandate of Palestine (now Israel and the Palestinian territories), rather than a purely Jewish state. She believed that this was a way to address Jewish statelessness and to avoid the pitfalls of nationalism. However, Hannah Arendt distanced herself from official Zionism in her article &#x27;Der Zionismus aus heutiger Sicht&#x27; (Zionism reconsidered) where she criticized the drift of the Zionist movement after their Atlantic City Conference in November 1944, asserting that this was the triumph of the sectarian ideology of the most extreme Zionists.

=== Racism ===
It was not just Arendt&#x27;s analysis of the Eichmann trial that drew accusations of racism. In her 1958 essay in &quot;Dissent&quot; entitled &quot;Reflections on Little Rock&quot; she expressed opposition to desegregation following the 1957 Little Rock Integration Crisis in Arkansas. As she explains in the preface, for a long time the magazine was reluctant to print her contribution, so far did it appear to differ from the publication&#x27;s liberal values. Eventually it was printed alongside critical responses. Later &quot;The New Yorker&quot; would express similar hesitancy over the Eichmann papers. So vehement was the response that Arendt felt obliged to defend herself in a sequel. The debate over this essay has continued since. William Simmons devotes a whole section of his 2011 text on human rights (&quot;Human Rights Law and the Marginalized Other&quot;) to a critique of Arendt&#x27;s position and in particular on Little Rock. While many critics feel she was fundamentally racist, many of those who have defended Arendt&#x27;s position have pointed out that her concerns were for the welfare of the children, a position she maintained throughout her life. She felt that white children were being thrown into a racially disharmonious &quot;jungle&quot; to serve a broader political strategy of forcible integration.

While over time Arendt conceded some ground to her critics, namely that she argued as an outsider, she remained committed to her central critique that children should not be thrust into the front-lines of geopolitical conflict. In &quot;Reflections on Little Rock&quot;, she wrote &quot;To force parents to send their children to an integrated school against their will means to deprive them of rights which clearly belong to them in all free societies-the private right over their children and the social right to free association. As for the children, forced integration means a very serious conflict between home and school, between their private and their social life, and while such conflicts are common in adult life, children cannot be expected to handle them and therefore should not be exposed to them.&quot; She also believed desegregation was an overreach of government authority, stating &quot;The conflict between a segregated home and a desegregated school, between family prejudice and school demands, abolishes at one stroke both the teachers&#x27; and the parents&#x27; authority, replacing it with the rule of public opinion among children who have neither the ability nor the right to establish a public opinion of their own.&quot;

=== Feminism ===
Embraced by feminists as a pioneer in a world dominated by men up to her time, Arendt did not call herself a feminist and would be very surprised to hear herself described as a feminist, remaining opposed to the social dimensions of Women&#x27;s Liberation, urging independence, but always keeping in mind &quot;Vive la petite différence!&quot; On becoming the first woman to be appointed a professor at Princeton in 1953, the media were much engaged in this exceptional achievement, but she never wanted to be seen as an exception, either as a woman (an &quot;exception woman&quot;) or a Jew, stating emphatically &quot;I am not disturbed at all about being a woman professor, because I am quite used to being a woman&quot;. In 1972, discussing women&#x27;s liberation, she observed &quot;the real question to ask is, what will we lose if we win?&quot;. She rather enjoyed what she saw as the privileges of being feminine as opposed to feminist, &quot;intensely feminine and therefore no feminist&quot;, stated Hans Jonas. Arendt considered some professions and positions unsuitable for women, particularly those involving leadership, telling Günter Gaus &quot;It just doesn&#x27;t look good when a woman gives orders&quot;. Despite these views, and having been labelled &quot;anti-feminist&quot;, much space has been devoted to examining Arendt&#x27;s place in relation to feminism. In the last years of her life, Virginia Held noted that Arendt&#x27;s views evolved with the emergence of a new feminism in America in the 1970s to recognize the importance of the women&#x27;s movement.

=== Critique of human rights ===
In &quot;The Origins of Totalitarianism&quot;, Hannah Arendt devotes a lengthy chapter (&quot;The Decline of the Nation-State and the End of the Rights of Man&quot;) to a critical analysis of human rights, in what has been described as &quot;the most widely read essay on refugees ever published&quot;. Arendt is not skeptical of the notion of political rights in general, but instead defends a national or civil conception of rights. Human rights, or the Rights of Man as they were commonly called, are universal, inalienable, and possessed simply by virtue of being human. In contrast, civil rights are possessed by virtue of belonging to a political community, most commonly by being a citizen. Arendt&#x27;s primary criticism of human rights is that they are ineffectual and illusory because their enforcement is in tension with national sovereignty. She argued that since there is no political authority above that of sovereign nations, state governments have little incentive to respect human rights when such policies conflict with national interests. This can be seen most clearly by examining the treatment of refugees and other stateless people. Since the refugee has no state to secure their civil rights, the only rights they have to fall back on are human rights. In this way Arendt uses the refugee as a test case for examining human rights in isolation from civil rights.

Arendt&#x27;s analysis draws on the refugee upheavals in the first half of the 20th century along with her own experience as a refugee fleeing Nazi Germany. She argued that as state governments began to emphasize national identity as a prerequisite for full legal status, the number of minority resident aliens increased along with the number of stateless persons whom no state was willing to recognize legally. The two potential solutions to the refugee problem, repatriation and naturalization, both proved incapable of solving the crisis. Arendt argued that repatriation failed to solve the refugee crisis because no government was willing to take them in and claim them as their own. When refugees were forcibly deported to neighboring countries, such immigration was deemed illegal by the receiving country, and so failed to change the fundamental status of the migrants as stateless. Attempts at naturalizing and assimilating refugees also had little success. This failure was primarily the result of resistance from both state governments and the majority of citizens, since both tended to see the refugees as undesirables who threatened their national identity. Resistance to naturalization also came from the refugees themselves who resisted assimilation and attempted to maintain their own ethnic and national identities. Arendt contends that neither naturalization nor the tradition of asylum was capable of handling the sheer number of refugees. Instead of accepting some refugees with legal status, the state often responded by denaturalizing minorities who shared national or ethnic ties with stateless refugees.

Arendt argues that the consistent mistreatment of refugees, most of whom were placed in internment camps, is evidence against the existence of human rights. If the notion of human rights as universal and inalienable is to be taken seriously, the rights must be realizable given the features of the modern liberal state. She concluded &quot;The Rights of Man, supposedly inalienable, proved to be unenforceable–even in countries whose constitutions were based upon them–whenever people appeared who were no longer citizens of any sovereign state&quot;. Arendt contends that they are not realizable because they are in tension with at least one feature of the liberal state—national sovereignty. One of the primary ways in which a nation exercises sovereignty is through control over national borders. State governments consistently grant their citizens free movement to traverse national borders. In contrast, the movement of refugees is often restricted in the name of national interests. This restriction presents a dilemma for liberalism because liberal theorists typically are committed to both human rights and the existence of sovereign nations.

In one of her most quoted passages, she puts forward the concept that human rights are little more than an abstraction:

The conception of human rights based upon the assumed existence of a human being as such broke down at the very moment when those who professed to believe in it were for the first time confronted with people who had indeed lost all other qualities and specific relationships – except that they were still human. The world found nothing sacred in the abstract nakedness of being human.

== In popular culture ==
Several authors have written biographies that focus on the relationship between Hannah Arendt and Martin Heidegger. In 1999, the French feminist philosopher Catherine Clément wrote a novel, &quot;Martin and Hannah&quot;, speculating on the triangular relationship between Heidegger and the two women in his life, Arendt and Heidegger&#x27;s wife Elfriede Petri. In addition to the relationships, the novel is a serious exploration of philosophical ideas, that centers on Arendt&#x27;s last meeting with Heidegger in Freiburg in 1975. The scene is based on Elisabeth Young-Bruehl&#x27;s description in &quot;Hannah Arendt: For Love of the World&quot; (1982), but reaches back to their childhoods, and Heidegger&#x27;s role in encouraging the relationship between the two women. The novel explores Heidegger&#x27;s embrace of Nazism as a proxy for that of Germany and, as in Arendt&#x27;s treatment of Eichmann, the difficult relationship between collective guilt and personal responsibility. Clément also brings Hannah&#x27;s other mentor and confidante, Karl Jaspers, into the matrix of relationships.

In 2012 the German film, &quot;Hannah Arendt&quot;, directed by Margarethe von Trotta was released. The film, with Barbara Sukowa in the title role, depicted the controversy over Arendt&#x27;s coverage of the Eichmann trial in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and her subsequent book, &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil&quot;, in which she was widely misunderstood as defending Eichmann and blaming Jewish leaders for the Holocaust. In 2015, the filmmaker Ada Ushpiz produced a documentary on Hannah Arendt, &quot;Vita Activa: The Spirit of Hannah Arendt&quot;. In the 2023 TV series &quot;Transatlantic&quot;, Arendt is portrayed by Alexa Karolinski.

== Legacy ==

Hannah Arendt is considered one of the most influential political philosophers of the 20th century. In 1998 Walter Laqueur stated &quot;No twentieth-century philosopher and political thinker has at the present time as wide an echo&quot;, as philosopher, historian, sociologist and also journalist. Arendt&#x27;s legacy has been described as a cult. In a 2016 review of a documentary about Arendt, the journalist A. O. Scott describes Hannah Arendt as &quot;of unmatched range and rigor&quot; as a thinker, although she is primarily known for the series of articles known as &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot; that she wrote for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and in particular for the one phrase &quot;the banality of evil&quot;.

She shunned publicity, never expecting, as she explained to Karl Jaspers in 1951, to see herself as a &quot;cover girl&quot; on the newsstands. In Germany, there are tours available of sites associated with her life.

The study of the life and work of Hannah Arendt, and of her political and philosophical theory is described as Arendtian. In her will she established the Hannah Arendt Bluecher Literary Trust as the custodian of her writings and photographs. Her personal library was deposited at Bard College at the Stevenson Library in 1976, and includes approximately 4,000 books, ephemera, and pamphlets from Arendt&#x27;s last apartment as well as her desk (in McCarthy House). The college has begun archiving some of the collection digitally, which is available at The Hannah Arendt Collection. Most of her papers were deposited at the Library of Congress and her correspondence with her German friends and mentors, such as Heidegger, Blumenfeld and Jaspers, at the Deutsches Literaturarchiv in Marbach. The Library of Congress listed more than 50 books written about her in 1998, and that number has continued to grow, as have the number of scholarly articles, estimated as 1000 at that time.

Her life and work is recognized by the institutions most closely associated with her teaching, by the creation of Hannah Arendt Centers at both Bard (Hannah Arendt Center for Politics and Humanities) and The New School, both in New York State. In Germany, her contributions to understanding authoritarianism is recognised by the Hannah-Arendt-Institut für Totalitarismusforschung (Hannah Arendt Institute for the Research on Totalitarianism) in Dresden. There are Hannah Arendt Associations (Hannah Arendt Verein) such as the Hannah Arendt Verein für politisches Denken in Bremen that awards the annual Hannah-Arendt-Preis für politisches Denken (Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Thinking) established in 1995. In Oldenburg, the Hannah Arendt Center at Carl von Ossietzky University was established in 1999, and holds a large collection of her work (Hannah Arendt Archiv), and administers the internet portal &quot;HannahArendt.net&quot; (A Journal for Political Thinking) as well as a monograph series, the &quot;Hannah Arendt-Studien&quot;. In Italy, the Hannah Arendt Center for Political Studies is situated at the University of Verona for Arendtian studies.

In 2017 a journal, &quot;Arendt Studies&quot;, was launched to publish articles related to the study of the life, work, and legacy of Hannah Arendt. Many places associated with her, have memorabilia of her on display, such as her student card at the University of Heidelberg (&quot;see image&quot;). 2006, the centennial of her birth, saw commemorations of her work in conferences and celebrations around the world.

Of the many photographic portraits of Arendt, that taken in 1944 by Fred Stein (&quot;see image&quot;), whose work she greatly admired, has become iconic, and has been described as better known than the photographer himself, having appeared on a German postage stamp.(&quot;see image&quot;) Among organizations that have recognized Arendt&#x27;s contributions to civilization and human rights, is the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).

=== Continuing interest ===

The rise of nativism, such as the election of Donald Trump in the United States, and concerns regarding an increasingly authoritarian style of governance has led to a surge of interest in Arendt and her writings, including radio broadcasts and writers, including Jeremy Adelman and Zoe Williams, to revisit Arendt&#x27;s ideas to seek the extent to which they inform our understanding of such movements, which are being described as &quot;Dark Times&quot;. At the same time Amazon reported that it had sold out of copies of &quot;The Origins of Totalitarianism&quot; (1951). Michiko Kakutani has addressed what she refers to as &quot;the death of truth&quot;. In her 2018 book, &quot;The Death of Truth: Notes on Falsehood in the Age of Trump&quot;, she argues that the rise of totalitarianism has been founded on the violation of truth. She begins her book with an extensive quote from &quot;The Origins of Totalitarianism&quot;:

The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction (i.e., the reality of experience) and the distinction between true and false (i.e., the standards of thought) no longer exist.

Kakutani and others believed that Arendt&#x27;s words speak not just events of a previous century but apply equally to the contemporary cultural landscape populated with fake news and lies. She also draws on Arendt&#x27;s essay &quot;Lying in Politics&quot; from &quot;Crises in the Republic&quot; pointing to the lines:

The historian knows how vulnerable is the whole texture of facts in which we spend our daily life; it is always in danger of being perforated by single lies or torn to shreds by the organized lying of groups, nations, or classes, or denied and distorted, often carefully covered up by reams of falsehoods or simply allowed to fall into oblivion. Facts need testimony to be remembered and trustworthy witnesses to be established in order to find a secure dwelling place in the domain of human affairs

Arendt drew attention to the critical role that propaganda plays in gaslighting populations, Kakutani observes, citing the passage:

In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and that nothing was true . ... The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness

Arendt took a broader perspective on history than merely totalitarianism in the early 20th century, stating &quot;the deliberate falsehood and the outright lie have been used as legitimate means to achieve political ends since the beginning of recorded history.&quot; Contemporary relevance is also reflected in the increasing use of the phrase, attributed to her, &quot;No one has the right to obey&quot; to reflect that actions result from choices, and hence judgement, and that we cannot disclaim responsibility for that which we have the power to act upon. In addition those centers established to promote Arendtian studies continue to seek solutions to a wide range of contemporary issues in her writing.

Arendt&#x27;s teachings on obedience have also been linked to the controversial psychology experiments by Stanley Milgram, that implied that ordinary people can easily be induced to commit atrocities. Milgram himself drew attention to this in 1974, stating that he was testing the theory that Eichmann like others would merely follow orders, but unlike Milgram she argued that actions involve responsibility.

Arendt&#x27;s theories on the political consequences of how nations deal with refugees have remained relevant and compelling. Arendt had observed first hand the displacement of large stateless and rightsless populations, treated not so much as people in need than as problems to solve, and in many cases, resist. She wrote about this in her 1943 essay &quot;We refugees&quot;. Another Arendtian theme that finds an echo in contemporary society is her observation, inspired by Rilke, of the despair of not being heard, the futility of tragedy that finds no listener that can bring comfort, assurance and intervention. An example of this being gun violence in America and the resulting political inaction.

&quot;In Search of the Last Agora&quot;, an illustrated documentary film by Lebanese director Rayyan Dabbous about Hannah Arendt&#x27;s 1958 work &quot;The Human Condition&quot;, was released in 2018 to mark the book&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Screened at Bard College, the experimental film is described as finding &quot;new meaning in the political theorist&#x27;s conceptions of politics, technology and society in the 1950s&quot;, particularly in her prediction of abuses of phenomena unknown in Arendt&#x27;s time, including social media, intense globalization, and obsessive celebrity culture.

=== Commemorations ===

Hannah Arendt&#x27;s life and work continue to be commemorated in many different ways, including plaques (&quot;Gedenktafeln&quot;) indicating places she has lived. Public places and institutions bear her name, including schools. There is also a Hannah Arendt Day (Hannah Arendt Tag) in her birthplace. Objects named after her vary from asteroids to trains and she has been commemorated in stamps. Museums and foundations include her name.

<text>Frantz Omar Fanon (, ; ; 20 July 1925 – 6 December 1961) was a French Afro-Caribbean psychiatrist, political philosopher, and Marxist from the French colony of Martinique (today a French department). His works have become influential in the fields of post-colonial studies, critical theory, and Marxism. As well as being an intellectual, Fanon was a political radical, Pan-Africanist, and Marxist humanist concerned with the psychopathology of colonization and the human, social, and cultural consequences of decolonization.

In the course of his work as a physician and psychiatrist, Fanon supported the Algerian War of independence from France and was a member of the Algerian National Liberation Front. Fanon has been described as &quot;the most influential anticolonial thinker of his time&quot;. For more than five decades, the life and works of Fanon have inspired national liberation movements and other freedom and political movements in Palestine, Sri Lanka, South Africa, and the United States. 

Fanon formulated a model for community psychology, believing that many mental health patients would have an improved prognosis if they were integrated into their family and community instead of being treated with institutionalized care. He also helped found the field of institutional psychotherapy while working at Saint-Alban under Francois Tosquelles and Jean Oury.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===

Frantz Omar Fanon was born on 20 July 1925 in Fort-de-France, Martinique, which was then part of the French colonial empire. His father, Félix Casimir Fanon, worked as a customs officer, while Fanon&#x27;s mother, Eléanore Médélice, who was of Afro-Caribbean and Alsatian descent, was a shopkeeper. Fanon was the third of four sons in a family of eight children. Two of his siblings died young, including Fanon&#x27;s sister Gabrielle, with whom he was very close. As they were middle class, his family could afford to send Fanon to the Lycée Victor Schœlcher, the most prestigious secondary school in Martinique, where Fanon came to admire one of his teachers, Aimé Césaire.

=== World War II ===

After the Battle of France resulted in the French Third Republic capitulating to Nazi Germany in July 1940, Martinique came under the control of French Navy elements led by Admiral Georges Robert who were loyal to the collaborationist Vichy regime. The disruption of imports from Metropolitan France led to major shortages on the island, which were exacerbated by an American naval blockade imposed on Martinique in April 1943. Robert&#x27;s authoritarian regime repressed local Allied sympathizers, hundreds of whom escaped to nearby Caribbean islands. Fanon later described the Vichy regime in Martinique as taking off their masks and behaving like &quot;authentic racists&quot;. In January 1943, he fled Martinique during the wedding of one of his brothers and travelled to the British colony of Dominica in order to link up with other Allied sympathizers. 

Robert&#x27;s regime was overthrown by a local uprising in June of that year, which Fanon would later acclaim as &quot;the birth of the [Martinican] proletariat&quot; as a revolutionary force. After the uprising, Fanon &quot;enthusiastically&quot; returned to Martinique, where Free French leader Charles de Gaulle had appointed Henri Tourtet as the colony&#x27;s new governor. Tourtet subsequently raised the 5th Antillean Marching Battalion to serve in Free French Forces (FFL), and Fanon soon joined the unit in Fort-de-France. He underwent basic training before boarding a troopship bound for Casablanca, Morocco in March 1944. After Fanon arrived in Morocco, he was shocked to discover the extent of racial discrimination in the FFL. He was subsequently transferred to a Free French military base in Béjaïa, Algeria, where Fanon witnessed firsthand the antisemitism and Islamophobia of the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot;, many of whom had supported racist laws promulgated by the Vichy regime.

In August 1944, he departed on another troopship from Oran to France as part of Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of German-occupied Provence. After the US VI Corps secured a beachhead, Fanon&#x27;s unit came ashore at Saint-Tropez and advanced inland. He participated in several engagements near Montbéliard, Doubs and was seriously wounded by shrapnel, which resulted in him being hospitalized for two months. Fanon was awarded a &quot;Croix de Guerre&quot; by Colonel Raoul Salan for his actions in battle, and in early 1945 rejoined his unit and fought in the Battle of Alsace. After German forces had been pushed out of France and Allied troops crossed the Rhine into Germany, Fanon and his fellow black troops were removed from their formations and sent southwards to Toulon as part of de Gaulle&#x27;s policy of removing non-white soldiers from the French army. He was subsequently transferred to Normandy to await repatriation.

Although Fanon had been initially eager to participate in the Allied war effort, the racism he witnessed during the war disillusioned him. Fanon wrote to his brother Joby from Europe that &quot;I&#x27;ve been deceived, and I am paying for my mistakes... I&#x27;m sick of it all.&quot; In the fall of 1945, a newly-discharged Fanon returned to Martinique, where he focused on completing his secondary education. Césaire, by now a friend and mentor of his, ran on the French Communist Party ticket as a delegate from Martinique to the first National Assembly of the French Fourth Republic, and Fanon worked for his campaign. Staying in Martinique long enough to complete his &quot;baccalauréat&quot;, Fanon proceeded to return to France, where he intended on studying medicine and psychiatry.

===France===

Fanon was educated in Lyon, where he also studied literature, drama and philosophy, sometimes attending Merleau-Ponty&#x27;s lectures. During this period, he wrote three plays, of which two survive. After qualifying as a psychiatrist in 1951, Fanon did a residency in psychiatry at Saint-Alban-sur-Limagnole under the radical Catalan psychiatrist François Tosquelles, who invigorated Fanon&#x27;s thinking by emphasizing the role of culture in psychopathology.

In 1948, Fanon started a relationship with Michèle Weyer, a medical student, who soon became pregnant. He left her for an 18-year-old high school student, Josie, whom he married in 1952. At urging of his friends he later recognized his daughter, Mireille, although he did not have contact with her.

In France while completing his residency, Fanon wrote and published his first book, &quot;Black Skin, White Masks&quot; (1952), an analysis of the negative psychological effects of colonial subjugation upon black people. Originally, the manuscript was the doctoral dissertation, submitted at Lyon, entitled &quot;Essay on the Disalienation of the Black&quot;, which was a response to the racism that Fanon experienced while studying psychiatry and medicine at university in Lyon; the rejection of the dissertation prompted Fanon to publish it as a book. For his doctor of philosophy degree, he submitted another dissertation of narrower scope and different subject. Left-wing philosopher Francis Jeanson, leader of the pro-Algerian independence Jeanson network, read Fanon&#x27;s manuscript and as a senior book editor at Éditions du Seuil in Paris, gave the book its new title and wrote its epilogue.

After receiving Fanon&#x27;s manuscript at Seuil, Jeanson invited him to an editorial meeting. Amid Jeanson&#x27;s praise of the book, Fanon exclaimed: &quot;Not bad for a nigger, is it?&quot; Insulted, Jeanson dismissed Fanon from his office. Later, Jeanson learned that his response had earned him the writer&#x27;s lifelong respect, and Fanon acceded to Jeanson&#x27;s suggestion that the book be entitled &quot;Black Skin, White Masks&quot;.

In the book, Fanon described the unfair treatment of black people in France and how they were disapproved of by white people. Frantz argued that racism and dehumanization directed toward black people caused feelings of inferiority among black people. This dehumanization prevented black people from fully assimilating into white society, and further, into full personhood. This caused psychological strife among black people, as even if they spoke French, obtained an education, and followed social customs associated with white people, they would still never be regarded as French, or a Man; instead, black people are defined as &quot;Black Man&quot; rather than &quot;Man&quot;. (See further discussion of &quot;Black Skin, White Masks&quot; under Work, below.)

===Algeria===

After his residency, Fanon practised psychiatry at Pontorson, near Mont Saint-Michel, for another year and then (from 1953) in Algeria. He was &quot;chef de service&quot; at the Blida-Joinville Psychiatric Hospital in Algeria. He worked there until his deportation in January 1957.

Fanon&#x27;s methods of treatment started evolving, particularly by beginning socio-therapy to connect with his patients&#x27; cultural backgrounds. He also trained nurses and interns. Following the outbreak of the Algerian revolution in November 1954, Fanon joined the Front de Libération Nationale, after having made contact with Pierre Chaulet at Blida in 1955. Working at a French hospital in Algeria, Fanon became responsible for treating the psychological distress of the French soldiers and officers who carried out torture in order to suppress anti-colonial resistance. Additionally, Fanon was also responsible for treating Algerian torture victims.

Fanon made extensive trips across Algeria, mainly in the Kabylia region, to study the cultural and psychological life of Algerians. His lost study of &quot;The marabout of Si Slimane&quot; is an example. These trips were also a means for clandestine activities, notably in his visits to the ski resort of Chrea which hid an FLN base.

===Joining the FLN and exile from Algeria===

By summer 1956, Fanon realized that he could no longer continue to support French efforts, even indirectly via his hospital work. In November he submitted his &quot;Letter of resignation to the Resident Minister&quot;, which later became an influential text of its own in anti-colonialist circles.
There comes a time when silence becomes dishonesty. The ruling intentions of personal existence are not in accord with the permanent assaults on the most commonplace values. For many months my conscience has been the seat of unpardonable debates. And the conclusion is the determination not to despair of man, in other words, of myself. The decision I have reached is that I cannot continue to bear a responsibility at no matter what cost, on the false pretext that there is nothing else to be done.
Shortly afterwards, Fanon was expelled from Algeria and moved to Tunis, where he joined the FLN openly. He was part of the editorial collective of &quot;Al Moudjahid&quot;, for which he wrote until the end of his life. He also served as Ambassador to Ghana for the Provisional Algerian Government (GPRA). He attended conferences in Accra, Conakry, Addis Ababa, Leopoldville, Cairo and Tripoli. Many of his shorter writings from this period were collected posthumously in the book &quot;Toward the African Revolution&quot;. In this book Fanon reveals war tactical strategies; in one chapter he discusses how to open a southern front to the war and how to run the supply lines.

Upon his return to Tunis, after his exhausting trip across the Sahara to open a Third Front, Fanon was diagnosed with leukemia. He went to the Soviet Union for treatment and experienced remission of his illness. When he came back to Tunis once again, he dictated his testament &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot;. When he was not confined to his bed, he delivered lectures to Armée de Libération Nationale (ALN) officers at Ghardimao on the Algerian–Tunisian border. He traveled to Rome for a three-day meeting with Jean-Paul Sartre, who had greatly influenced his work. Sartre agreed to write a preface to Fanon&#x27;s last book, &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot;.
===Death and aftermath===

With his health declining, Fanon&#x27;s comrades urged him to seek treatment in the U.S. as his Soviet doctors had suggested. In 1961, the CIA arranged a trip under the promise of stealth for further leukemia treatment at a National Institutes of Health facility. During his time in the United States, Fanon was handled by CIA agent Oliver Iselin. As Lewis R. Gordon points out, the circumstances of Fanon&#x27;s stay are somewhat disputed: &quot;What has become orthodoxy, however, is that he was kept in a hotel without treatment for several days until he contracted pneumonia.&quot;

Fanon subsequently died from double pneumonia in Bethesda, Maryland, on 6 December 1961 after finally having begun his leukemia treatment, although far too late. He had been admitted under the name of Ibrahim Omar Fanon, a Libyan &quot;nom de guerre&quot; he had assumed in order to enter a hospital in Rome after being wounded in Morocco during a mission for the Algerian National Liberation Front. He was buried in Algeria after lying in state in Tunisia. Later, his body was moved to a martyrs&#x27; (&quot;Chouhada&quot;) graveyard at Aïn Kerma in eastern Algeria.

Frantz Fanon was survived by his French wife, Josie (née Dublé), their son, Olivier Fanon, and his daughter from a previous relationship, Mireille Fanon-Mendès France. Josie Fanon later became disillusioned with the government and after years of depression and drinking died by suicide in Algiers in 1989. Mireille became a professor of international law and conflict resolution and serves as president of the Frantz Fanon Foundation. Olivier became president of the Frantz Fanon National Association, which was created in Algiers in 2012.

==Work==
=== &quot;Black Skin, White Masks&quot; ===

&quot;Black Skin, White Masks&quot; was first published in French as &quot;Peau noire, masques blancs&quot; in 1952 and is one of Fanon&#x27;s most important works. In &quot;Black Skin, White Masks,&quot; Fanon psychoanalyzes the oppressed black person who is perceived to have to be a lesser creature in the white world that they live in, and studies how they navigate the world through a performance of Whiteness. Particularly in discussing language, he talks about how the black person&#x27;s use of a colonizer&#x27;s language is seen by the colonizer as predatory, and not transformative, which in turn may create insecurity in the black&#x27;s consciousness. He recounts that he himself faced many admonitions as a child for using Creole French instead of &quot;real French&quot;, or &quot;French French&quot;, that is, &quot;white&quot; French. Ultimately, he concludes that &quot;mastery of language [of the white/colonizer] for the sake of recognition &quot;as white&quot; reflects a dependency that subordinates the black&#x27;s humanity&quot;.

The reception of his work has been affected by English translations which are recognized to contain numerous omissions and errors, while his unpublished work, including his doctoral thesis, has received little attention. As a result, it has been argued Fanon has often been portrayed as an advocate of violence (it would be more accurate to characterize him as a dialectical opponent of nonviolence) and that his ideas have been extremely oversimplified. This reductionist vision of Fanon&#x27;s work ignores the subtlety of his understanding of the colonial system. For example, the fifth chapter of &quot;Black Skin, White Masks&quot; translates, literally, as &quot;The Lived Experience of the Black&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;expérience vécue du Noir&quot;), but Markmann&#x27;s translation is &quot;The Fact of Blackness&quot;, which leaves out the massive influence of phenomenology on Fanon&#x27;s early work.

Although Fanon wrote &quot;Black Skin, White Masks&quot; while still in France, most of his work was written in North Africa. It was during this time that he produced works such as &quot;L&#x27;An Cinq, de la Révolution Algérienne&quot; in 1959 (&quot;Year Five of the Algerian Revolution&quot;), later republished as &quot;Sociology of a Revolution&quot; and later still as &quot;A Dying Colonialism&quot;. Fanon&#x27;s original title was &quot;Reality of a Nation&quot;; however the publisher, François Maspero, refused to accept this title.

Fanon&#x27;s three books were supplemented by numerous psychiatry articles as well as radical critiques of French colonialism in journals such as &quot;Esprit&quot; and El Moudjahid.

=== &quot;A Dying Colonialism&quot; ===

&quot;A Dying Colonialism&quot; is a 1959 book by Fanon that provides an account of how, during the Algerian Revolution, the people of Algeria fought their oppressors. They changed centuries-old cultural patterns and embraced certain ancient cultural practices long derided by their colonialist oppressors as &quot;primitive,&quot; in order to destroy the oppressors. Fanon uses the fifth year of the Algerian Revolution as a point of departure for an explication of the inevitable dynamics of colonial oppression. The militant book describes Fanon&#x27;s understanding that for the colonized, “having a gun is the only chance you still have of giving a meaning to your death.” It also contains one of his most influential articles, &quot;Unveiled Algeria&quot;, that signifies the fall of imperialism and describes how oppressed people struggle to decolonize their &quot;mind&quot; to avoid assimilation.

=== &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot; ===

In &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot; (1961, &quot;Les damnés de la terre&quot;), published shortly before Fanon&#x27;s death, Fanon defends the right of a colonized people to use violence to gain independence. In addition, he delineated the processes and forces leading to national independence or neocolonialism during the decolonization movement that engulfed much of the world after World War II. In defence of the use of violence by colonized peoples, Fanon argued that human beings who are not considered as such (by the colonizer) shall not be bound by principles that apply to humanity in their attitude towards the colonizer. His book was censored by the French government.

For Fanon in &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot;, the colonizer&#x27;s presence in Algeria is based on sheer military strength. Any resistance to this strength must also be of a violent nature because it is the only &quot;language&quot; the colonizer speaks. Thus, violent resistance is a necessity imposed by the colonists upon the colonized. The relevance of language and the reformation of discourse pervades much of his work, which is why it is so interdisciplinary, spanning psychiatric concerns to encompass politics, sociology, anthropology, linguistics and literature.

His participation in the Algerian Front de Libération Nationale from 1955 determined his audience as the Algerian colonized. It was to them that his final work, &quot;Les damnés de la terre&quot; (translated into English by Constance Farrington as &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot;) was directed. It constitutes a warning to the oppressed of the dangers they face in the whirlwind of decolonization and the transition to a neo-colonialist, globalized world.

An often overlooked aspect of Fanon&#x27;s work is that he did not like to physically write his pieces. Instead, he would dictate to his wife, Josie, who did all of the writing and, in some cases, contributed and edited.

==Influences==
Fanon was influenced by a variety of thinkers and intellectual traditions including Jean-Paul Sartre, Jacques Lacan, Négritude, and Marxism.

Aimé Césaire was a particularly significant influence in Fanon&#x27;s life. Césaire, a leader of the &quot;Négritude&quot; movement, was teacher and mentor to Fanon on the island of Martinique. Fanon was first introduced to &quot;Négritude&quot; during his lycée days in Martinique when Césaire coined the term and presented his ideas in &quot;Tropiques&quot;, the journal that he edited with Suzanne Césaire, his wife, in addition to his now classic &quot;Cahier d&#x27;un retour au pays natal &quot; (Journal of a Homecoming). Fanon referred to Césaire&#x27;s writings in his own work. He quoted, for example, his teacher at length in &quot;The Lived Experience of the Black Man&quot;, a heavily anthologized essay from &quot;Black Skins, White Masks&quot;.

==Legacy==
Fanon has had an influence on anti-colonial and national liberation movements. In particular, &quot;Les damnés de la terre&quot; was a major influence on the work of revolutionary leaders such as Ali Shariati in Iran, Steve Biko in South Africa, Malcolm X in the United States and Ernesto Che Guevara in Cuba. Of these, only Guevara was primarily concerned with Fanon&#x27;s theories on violence; for Shariati and Biko the main interest in Fanon was &quot;the new man&quot; and &quot;black consciousness&quot; respectively.

With regard to the American liberation struggle more commonly known as The Black Power Movement, Fanon&#x27;s work was especially influential. His book &quot;Wretched of the Earth&quot; is quoted directly in the preface of Stokely Carmichael (Kwame Ture) and Charles Hamilton&#x27;s book, &quot;Black Power: The Politics of Liberation&quot; which was published in 1967, shortly after Carmichael left the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). In addition, Carmichael and Hamilton include much of Fanon&#x27;s theory on Colonialism in their work, beginning by framing the situation of former slaves in America as a colony situated inside a nation. &quot;To put it another way, there is no &quot;American dilemma&quot; because black people in this country form a colony, and it is not in the interest of the colonial power to liberate them&quot; (Ture Hamilton, 5). Another example is the indictment of the black middle class or what Fanon called the &quot;colonized intellectual&quot; as the indoctrinated followers of the colonial power. Fanon states, &quot;The native intellectual has clothed his aggressiveness in his barely veiled desire to assimilate himself to the colonial world&quot; (47). A third example is the idea that the natives (African Americans) should be constructing new social systems rather than participating in the systems created by the settler population. Ture and Hamilton contend that &quot;black people should create rather than imitate&quot; (144).

The Black Power group that Fanon had the most influence on was the Black Panther Party (BPP). In 1970 Bobby Seale, the Chairman of the BPP, published a collection of recorded observations made while he was incarcerated entitled &quot;Seize the Time: The Story of the Black Panther Party and Huey P. Newton&quot;. This book, while not an academic text, is a primary source chronicling the history of the BPP through the eyes of one of its founders. While describing one of his first meetings with Huey P. Newton, Seale describes bringing him a copy of &quot;Wretched of the Earth&quot;. There are at least three other direct references to the book, all of them mentioning ways in which the book was influential and how it was included in the curriculum required of all new BPP members. Beyond just reading the text, Seale and the BPP included much of the work in their party platform. The Panther 10 Point Plan contained six points which either directly or indirectly referenced ideas in Fanon&#x27;s work; these six points included their contention that there must be an end to the &quot;robbery by the white man&quot;, and &quot;education that teaches us our true history and our role in present day society&quot; (67). One of the most important elements adopted by the BPP was the need to build the &quot;humanity&quot; of the native. Fanon claimed that the realization by the native that s/he was human would mark the beginning of the push for freedom (33). The BPP embraced this idea through the work of their Community Schools and Free Breakfast Programs.

Bolivian indianist Fausto Reinaga also had some Fanon influence and he mentions &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot; in his magnum opus &quot;La Revolución India&quot;, advocating for decolonisation of native South Americans from European influence. In 2015, Raúl Zibechi argued that Fanon had become a key figure for the Latin American left. In August 2021 Fanon&#x27;s book &quot;Voices of liberation&quot; was one of those brought by Elisa Loncón to the new &quot;plurinational library&quot; of the Constitutional Convention of Chile.

Fanon&#x27;s influence extended to the liberation movements of the Palestinians, the Tamils, African Americans and others. His work was a key influence on the Black Panther Party, particularly his ideas concerning nationalism, violence and the lumpenproletariat. More recently, radical South African poor people&#x27;s movements, such as Abahlali baseMjondolo (meaning &#x27;people who live in shacks&#x27; in Zulu), have been influenced by Fanon&#x27;s work. His work was a key influence on Brazilian educationist Paulo Freire, as well.

Fanon has also profoundly affected contemporary African literature. His work serves as an important theoretical gloss for writers including Ghana&#x27;s Ayi Kwei Armah, Senegal&#x27;s Ken Bugul and Ousmane Sembène, Zimbabwe&#x27;s Tsitsi Dangarembga, and Kenya&#x27;s Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o. Ngũgĩ goes so far to argue in &quot;Decolonizing the Mind&quot; (1992) that it is &quot;impossible to understand what informs African writing&quot; without reading Fanon&#x27;s &quot;Wretched of the Earth&quot;.

The Caribbean Philosophical Association offers the Frantz Fanon Prize for work that furthers the decolonization and liberation of mankind.

Fanon&#x27;s writings on black sexuality in &quot;Black Skin, White Masks&quot; have garnered critical attention by a number of academics and queer theory scholars. Interrogating Fanon&#x27;s perspective on the nature of black homosexuality and masculinity, queer theory academics have offered a variety of critical responses to Fanon&#x27;s words, balancing his position within postcolonial studies with his influence on the formation of contemporary black queer theory.

Fanon&#x27;s legacy has expanded even further into Black Studies and more specifically, into the theories of Afro-pessimism and Black Critical Theory. Thinkers such as Sylvia Wynter, David Marriott, Frank B. Wilderson III, Jared Sexton, Calvin Warren, and Zakkiyah Iman Jackson have taken up Fanon&#x27;s ontological, phenomenological, and psychoanalytic analyses of the Negro and the &quot;zone of non-being&quot; in order to develop theories of anti-Blackness. Putting Fanon in conversation with prominent thinkers such as Sylvia Wynter, Saidiya Hartman, and Hortense Spillers, and focusing primarily on the Charles Lam Markmann translation of &quot;Black Skin, White Masks&quot;, Black Critical Theorists and Afropessimists take seriously the ontological implications of the &quot;Fact of Blackness&quot; and &quot;The Negro and Psychopathology&quot;, formulating the Black or the Slave as the non-relational, phobic object that constitutes civil society.

<text>Fleming and John is a musical husband and wife team, Fleming McWilliams and John Mark Painter, currently living in Nashville, Tennessee, United States. 

The couple met while attending Belmont University in Nashville, and immediately began collaborating on songs. While pursuing a record contract, Painter began playing in studio sessions for artists like dc Talk, Sixpence None the Richer, Indigo Girls, Jars of Clay, Nanci Griffith, and Jewel. 

In 1994, the band recorded &quot;Harder to Believe than Not To&quot; for &quot;I Predict A Clone&quot;, a tribute album to Steve Taylor. The following year, the couple released their first album, &quot;Delusions of Grandeur&quot; on Universal Records. Ben Folds, who called Fleming and John &quot;the Carpenters of the 1990s with Led Zeppelin&#x27;s rhythm section&quot;, invited them to open for his band. They continued to perform and record with Folds for many years, with both being featured on Folds&#x27; experimental album, Fear of Pop: Volume 1. 

In 1999, Fleming and John released their second album, &quot;The Way We Are&quot;, which spawned a minor hit with the single &quot;Ugly Girl&quot;.

The duo has recorded many cover songs, including &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot; (to the tune of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot;), &quot;Eldorado&quot; (Electric Light Orchestra), &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot; (The Mamas &amp; the Papas), &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; (Jefferson Airplane), &quot;After the Lovin&#x27;&quot; (Engelbert Humperdinck). A longtime concert favorite has been Sonny &amp; Cher&#x27;s &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; to the tune of Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Black Dog&quot;.

The band has been dormant since the tour for &quot;The Way We Are&quot; finished in the late 1990s. However, they made songs available for purchase on their page on their MySpace pace, and they successfully funded a 2015 Kickstarter campaign to record a new album. Initially promised by Christmas that year, as of 2024 the album has still not been released.

John and Fleming continue to run IHOF (International House of Fleming) studios and the DWEEB recording label, blogging about their latest projects.

<doc id="95193" wikidata="Q1056973" url="?curid=95193" title="Sixpence None the Richer">
<text>Sixpence None the Richer (also known as Sixpence) is an American alternative rock band that formed in New Braunfels, Texas, and eventually settled in Nashville, Tennessee. They are best known for their songs &quot;Kiss Me&quot; and &quot;Breathe Your Name&quot; and their covers of &quot;Don&#x27;t Dream It&#x27;s Over&quot; and &quot;There She Goes&quot;. 

The band received two Grammy Award nominations, Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for &quot;Kiss Me&quot; and Grammy Award for Best Rock Gospel Album for &quot;Sixpence None the Richer&quot; (1997).

The name of the band is inspired by a passage from the book &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; by C. S. Lewis discussing how children buying gifts for their parents with the parents&#x27; money means the parents are &quot;None the Richer&quot; monetarily but yet clearly there is value in the act (mirroring the Christian God/human dynamic, and notably pointing out the responsibilities of the child/humans to have humility about their offerings).

==History==
===Formation and early years (1992–1996)===
Guitarist/songwriter Matt Slocum met Leigh Nash in the early 1990s and recorded a demo, circulated as &quot;The Original Demos&quot;, with bassist T.J. Behling at Verge Music Works recording studio in Dallas, and eventually an album, &quot;The Fatherless and the Widow&quot;, for the independent label R.E.X. Records in 1994. After adding more members, the band toured in support of &quot;The Fatherless and The Widow&quot;. The band released &quot;This Beautiful Mess&quot; in 1995.

===Into the mainstream (1997–2004)===
In 1997, the group signed to Steve Taylor&#x27;s label Squint Entertainment and released a self-titled album, which slowly began garnering attention from a wider audience in the mainstream industry. 

In 1998, &quot;Kiss Me&quot; was released as a single, propelling Sixpence None the Richer into the national pop spotlight. The next year, the band followed up &quot;Kiss Me&quot; with a cover of The La&#x27;s&#x27; &quot;There She Goes&quot;. Sixpence appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, and numerous morning talk shows. 

The band had a follow-up album ready to release, but their label Squint Entertainment started to fall apart, leaving the band in limbo for several years. Finally, Squint Entertainment folded, and the album, &quot;Divine Discontent&quot;, was released in October 2002.

On February 26, 2004, Matt Slocum announced that the group had disbanded.

=== First Reunion and &quot;Lost in Transition&quot; (2007–2016) ===
In November 2007, Sixpence None the Richer reunited. They released the EP &quot;My Dear Machine&quot; on the website NoiseTrade in 2008, the band&#x27;s first official release since &quot;The Best of Sixpence None the Richer&quot; in 2004. 

In October 2008, they released a Christmas album titled &quot;The Dawn of Grace&quot;.

Sixpence signed to Credential Recordings and played a headline slot at the 2009 Greenbelt Festival in the UK. According to Nash, the band began recording a new album in January 2010. The album, Lost in Transition, was released on August 7, 2012.

On November 12, 2016, the band performed at the Love Love Rock Festival in Taipei, Taiwan, playing the hits &quot;Don&#x27;t Dream It&#x27;s Over&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me&quot; and &quot;There She Goes&quot;.

=== Second Reunion and &quot;Rosemary Hill&quot; (2023-present) ===
In September 2023, Leigh Nash released a single, &quot;The Tide&quot;, that additionally credited Sixpence None the Richer, making it their first new song in 11 years. Additionally, Matt and Leigh announced a new tour with 10,000 Maniacs, playing songs from both bands, but in January 2024, Matt and Leigh left the tour early, noting the duo &quot;had other commitments arise&quot;.

In January 2024, it was announced that drummer Dale Baker was returning to the band and that they had signed a management deal with Deep South Entertainment with plans to re-release their self-titled album on vinyl. In June, they announced a new 25th Anniversary tour with all the original members for the first time since Baker left. In August 2024, they announced a new single, &quot;We are Love&quot;, and a new EP, &quot;Rosemary Hill&quot;, to be released in October 2024.
