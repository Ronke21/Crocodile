<text>Daguerreotype was the first publicly available photographic process, widely used during the 1840s and 1850s. &quot;Daguerreotype&quot; also refers to an image created through this process.

Invented by Louis Daguerre and introduced worldwide in 1839, the daguerreotype was almost completely superseded by 1856 with new, less expensive processes, such as ambrotype (collodion process), that yield more readily viewable images. There has been a revival of the daguerreotype since the late 20th century by a small number of photographers interested in making artistic use of early photographic processes.

To make the image, a daguerreotypist polished a sheet of silver-plated copper to a mirror finish; treated it with fumes that made its surface light-sensitive; exposed it in a camera for as long as was judged to be necessary, which could be as little as a few seconds for brightly sunlit subjects or much longer with less intense lighting; made the resulting latent image on it visible by fuming it with mercury vapor; removed its sensitivity to light by liquid chemical treatment; rinsed and dried it; and then sealed the easily marred result behind glass in a protective enclosure.

The image is on a mirror-like silver surface and will appear either positive or negative, depending on the angle at which it is viewed, how it is lit and whether a light or dark background is being reflected in the metal. The darkest areas of the image are simply bare silver; lighter areas have a microscopically fine light-scattering texture. The surface is very delicate, and even the lightest wiping can permanently scuff it. Some tarnish around the edges is normal.

Several types of antique photographs, most often ambrotypes and tintypes, but sometimes even old prints on paper, are commonly misidentified as daguerreotypes, especially if they are in the small, ornamented cases in which daguerreotypes made in the US and the UK were usually housed. The name &quot;daguerreotype&quot; correctly refers only to one very specific image type and medium, the product of a process that was in wide use only from the early 1840s to the late 1850s.

== History ==
Since the Renaissance era, artists and inventors had searched for a mechanical method of capturing visual scenes. Using the camera obscura, artists would manually trace what they saw, or use the optical image as a basis for solving the problems of perspective and parallax, and deciding color values. A camera obscura optically reduces a real scene in three-dimensional space to a flat rendition in two dimensions.

In the early 17th century, the Italian physician and chemist Angelo Sala wrote that powdered silver nitrate was blackened by the sun, but did not find any practical application of the phenomenon.

The discovery and commercial availability of the halogens—iodine, bromine and chlorine a few years earlier (iodine was discovered by Courtois in 1811, bromine by Löwig in 1825 and Balard in 1826 independently, and chlorine by Scheele in 1774)—meant that silver photographic processes that rely on the reduction of silver iodide, silver bromide and silver chloride to metallic silver became feasible. The daguerreotype is one of these processes, but was not the first, as Niépce had experimented with paper silver chloride negatives while Wedgwood&#x27;s experiments were with silver nitrate as were Schultze&#x27;s stencils of letters. Hippolyte Bayard had been persuaded by François Arago to wait before making his paper process public.

Previous discoveries of photosensitive methods and substances—including silver nitrate by Albertus Magnus in the 13th century, a silver and chalk mixture by Johann Heinrich Schulze in 1724, and Joseph Niépce&#x27;s bitumen-based heliography in 1822—contributed to development of the daguerreotype.

The first reliably documented attempt to capture the image formed in a camera obscura was made by Thomas Wedgwood as early as the 1790s, but according to an 1802 account of his work by Sir Humphry Davy:

The images formed by means of a camera obscura have been found too faint to produce, in any moderate time, an effect upon the nitrate of silver. To copy these images was the first object of Mr. Wedgwood in his researches on the subject, and for this purpose he first used the nitrate of silver, which was mentioned to him by a friend, as a substance very sensible to the influence of light; but all his numerous experiments as to their primary end proved unsuccessful.

=== Development in France ===
In 1829 French artist and chemist Louis Daguerre, when obtaining a camera obscura for his work on theatrical scene painting from the optician Chevalier, was put into contact with Nicéphore Niépce, who had already managed to make a record of an image from a camera obscura using the process he invented: heliography.

Daguerre met with Niépce and entered into correspondence with him. Niépce had invented an early internal combustion engine, (the Pyréolophore), together with his brother Claude and made improvements to the velocipede, as well as experimenting with lithography and related processes. Their correspondence reveals that Niépce was at first reluctant to divulge any details of his work with photographic images. To guard against letting any secrets out before the invention had been improved, they used a numerical code for security. 15, for example, signified the tanning action of the sun on human skin (&quot;action solaire sur les corps&quot;); 34 – a camera obscura (&quot;chambre noir&quot;); 73 – sulphuric acid.
The written contract drawn up between Nicéphore Niépce and Daguerre includes an undertaking by Niépce to release details of the process he had invented – the asphalt process or heliography. Daguerre was sworn to secrecy under penalty of damages and undertook to design a camera and improve the process. The improved process was eventually named the physautotype.

Niépce&#x27;s early experiments had derived from his interest in lithography and consisted of capturing the image in a camera (then called a camera obscura), resulting in an engraving that could be printed through various lithographic processes. The asphalt process or heliography required exposures that were so long that Arago said it was not fit for use. Nevertheless, without Niépce&#x27;s experiments, it is unlikely that Daguerre would have been able to build on them to adapt and improve what turned out to be the daguerreotype process.

After Niépce&#x27;s death in 1833, his son, Isidore, inherited rights in the contract and a new version was drawn up between Daguerre and Isidore. Isidore signed the document admitting that the old process had been improved to the limits that were possible and that a new process that would bear Daguerre&#x27;s name alone was 60 to 80 times as rapid as the old asphalt (bitumen) one his father had invented. This was the daguerreotype process that used iodized silvered plates and was developed with mercury fumes.

To exploit the invention, 400 shares would be on offer for 1,000 francs each; secrecy would be lifted after 100 shares had been sold, or the rights of the process could be bought for 20,000 francs.

Daguerre wrote to Isidore Niepce on 2 January 1839 about his discussion with Arago:

He sees difficulty with this proceeding by subscription; it is almost certain – just as I myself have been convinced ever since looking on my first specimens – that subscription would not serve. Everyone says it is superb: but it will cost us the thousand francs before we learn it [the process] and be able to judge if it could remain secret. M. de Mandelot himself knows several persons who could subscribe but will not do so because they think it [the secret] would be revealed by itself, and now I have proof that many think in this way. I entirely agree with the idea of M. Arago, that is get the government to purchase this discovery, and that he himself would pursue this in the chambre. I have already seen several deputies who are of the same opinion and would give support; this way it seems to me to have the most chance of success; thus, my dear friend, I think it is the best option, and everything makes me think we will not regret it. For a start M. Arago will speak next Monday at the Académie des Sciences ...

Isidore did not contribute anything to the invention of the Daguerreotype and he was not let in on the details of the invention. Nevertheless, he benefited from the state pension awarded to him together with Daguerre.

Miles Berry, a patent agent acting on Daguerre&#x27;s and Isidore Niépce&#x27;s behalf in England, wrote a six-page memorial to the Board of the Treasury in an attempt to repeat the French arrangement in Great Britain, &quot;for the purpose of throwing it open in England for the benefit of the public.&quot;

The Treasury wrote to Miles Berry on 3 April to inform him of their decision:

Without bills being passed by Parliament, as had been arranged in France, Arago having presented a bill in the House of Deputies and Gay-Lussac in the Chamber of Peers, there was no possibility of repeating the French arrangement in England which is why the daguerreotype was given free to the world by the French government with the exception of England and Wales for which Richard Beard controlled the patent rights.

Daguerre patented his process in England, and Richard Beard patented his improvements to the process in Scotland During this time the astronomer and member of the House of Deputies François Arago had sought a solution whereby the invention would be given free to the world by the passing of Acts in the French Parliament. Richard Beard, controlled most of the licences in England and Wales with the exception of Antoine Claudet who had purchased a licence directly from Daguerre.

In the US, Alexander S. Wolcott invented the mirror daguerreotype camera, according to John Johnson&#x27;s account, in one single day after reading the description of the daguerreotype process published in English translation.

Johnson&#x27;s father travelled to England with some specimen portraits to patent the camera and met with Richard Beard who bought the patent for the camera, and a year later bought the patent for the daguerreotype outright. Johnson assisted Beard in setting up a portrait studio on the roof of the Regent Street Polytechnic and managed Beard&#x27;s daguerreotype studio in Derby and then Manchester for some time before returning to the US.

Wolcott&#x27;s Mirror Camera, which gave postage stamp sized miniatures, was in use for about two years before it was replaced by Petzval&#x27;s Portrait lens, which gave larger and sharper images.

Antoine Claudet had purchased a licence from Daguerre directly to produce daguerreotypes. His uncle, the banker Vital Roux, arranged that he should head the glass factory at Choisy-le-Roi together with Georges Bontemps and moved to England to represent the factory with a showroom in High Holborn. At one stage, Beard sued Claudet with the aim of claiming that he had a monopoly of daguerreotypy in England, but lost. Niépce&#x27;s aim originally had been to find a method to reproduce prints and drawings for lithography. He had started out experimenting with light-sensitive materials and had made a contact print from a drawing and then went on to successfully make the first photomechanical record of an image in a camera obscura – the world&#x27;s first photograph. Niépce&#x27;s method was to coat a pewter plate with bitumen of Judea (asphalt) and the action of the light differentially hardened the bitumen. The plate was washed with a mixture of oil of lavender and turpentine leaving a relief image. Later, Daguerre&#x27;s and Niépce&#x27;s improvement to the heliograph process, the physautotype, reduced the exposure to eight hours.

Early experiments required hours of exposure in the camera to produce visible results. Modern photo-historians consider the stories of Daguerre discovering mercury development by accident because of a bowl of mercury left in a cupboard, or, alternatively, a broken thermometer, to be spurious.

Another story of a fortunate accident, which modern photo historians are now doubtful about, and was related by Louis Figuier, of a silver spoon lying on an iodized silver plate which left its design on the plate by light perfectly. Noticing this, Daguerre supposedly wrote to Niépce on 21 May 1831 suggesting the use of iodized silver plates as a means of obtaining light images in the camera.

Daguerre did not give a clear account of his method of discovery and allowed these legends to become current after the secrecy had been lifted.

Letters from Niépce to Daguerre dated 24 June and 8 November 1831, show that Niépce was unsuccessful in obtaining satisfactory results following Daguerre&#x27;s suggestion, although he had produced a negative on an iodized silver plate in the camera. Niépce&#x27;s letters to Daguerre dated 29 January and 3 March 1832 show that the use of iodized silver plates was due to Daguerre and not Niépce.

Jean-Baptiste Dumas, who was president of the National Society for the Encouragement of Science (Société d&#x27;encouragement pour l&#x27;industrie nationale) and a chemist, put his laboratory at Daguerre&#x27;s disposal. According to Austrian chemist Josef Maria Eder, Daguerre was not versed in chemistry and it was Dumas who suggested Daguerre use sodium hyposulfite, discovered by Herschel in 1819, as a fixer to dissolve the unexposed silver salts.

== First mention in print (1835) and public announcement (1839) ==
A paragraph tacked onto the end of a review of one of Daguerre&#x27;s Diorama spectacles in the &quot;Journal des artistes&quot; on 27 September 1835, a Diorama painting of a landslide that occurred in &quot;La Vallée de Goldau&quot;, made passing mention of rumour that was going around the Paris studios of Daguerre&#x27;s attempts to make a visual record on metal plates of the fleeting image produced by the camera obscura:

It is said that Daguerre has found the means to collect, on a plate prepared by him, the image produced by the camera obscura, in such a way that a portrait, a landscape, or any view, projected upon this plate by the ordinary camera obscura, leaves an imprint in light and shade there, and thus presents the most perfect of all drawings ... a preparation put over this image preserves it for an indefinite time ... the physical sciences have perhaps never presented a marvel comparable to this one.A further clue to fixing the date of invention of the process is that when the Paris correspondent of the London periodical &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; reported the public announcement of the daguerreotype in 1839, he mentioned that the daguerreotypes now being produced were of considerably better quality than the ones he had seen &quot;four years earlier&quot;.

The father of Viollet-le-Duc wrote in September 1836 that he saw a photograph made by Daguerre from the top of his diorama. The picture showed the hills of Montmartre. With a weak magnifying glass it was possible to distinguish the details of the telegraph tower more than one and a half miles away. In April 1837, Daguerre remarked to Isidore Niépce that his equipment for taking daguerreotypes was ready, and the only thing he needed was good weather.

At a joint meeting of the French Academy of Sciences and the held at the &quot;Institut de Françe&quot; on Monday, 19 August 1839 François Arago briefly referred to the earlier process that Niépce had developed and Daguerre had helped to improve without mentioning them by name (the heliograph and the physautotype) in rather disparaging terms stressing their inconvenience and disadvantages such as that exposures were so long as eight hours that required a full day&#x27;s exposure during which time the sun had moved across the sky removing all trace of halftones or modelling in round objects, and the photographic layer was apt to peel off in patches, while praising the daguerreotype in glowing terms. Overlooking Nicéphore Niépce&#x27;s contribution in this way led Niépce&#x27;s son, Isidore to resent his father being ignored as having been the first to capture the image produced in a camera by chemical means, and Isidore wrote a pamphlet in defence of his father&#x27;s reputation &quot;Histoire de la découverte improprement nommé daguerréotype&quot; (&quot;History of the discovery improperly named the daguerreotype&quot;).

Daguerre was present but complained of a sore throat. Later that year William Fox Talbot announced his silver chloride &quot;sensitive paper&quot; process.

Together, these announcements caused early commentators to choose 1839 as the year photography was born, or made public. Later, it became known that Niépce&#x27;s role had been downplayed in Arago&#x27;s efforts to publicize the daguerreotype, and the first photograph is recorded in Eder&#x27;s &quot;History of Photography&quot; as having been taken in 1826 or 1827. Niépce&#x27;s reputation as the real inventor of photography became known through his son Isidore&#x27;s indignation that his father&#x27;s early experiments had been overlooked or ignored although Nicéphore had revealed his process, which, at the time, was secret.

The phrase &quot;the birth of photography&quot; has been used by different authors to mean different things – either the publicizing of the process (in 1839) as a metaphor to indicate that previous to that the daguerreotype process had been kept secret; or, the date the first photograph was taken by or with a camera (using the asphalt process or heliography), thought to have been 1822, but Eder&#x27;s research indicates that the date was more probably 1826 or later. Fox Talbot&#x27;s first photographs, on the other hand, were made &quot;in the brilliant summer of 1835.&quot;

Daguerre and Niépce had together signed a good agreement in which remuneration for the invention would be paid for by subscription. However, the campaign they launched to finance the invention failed. François Arago, whose views on the system of patenting inventions can be gathered from speeches he made later in the House of Deputies (he apparently thought the English patent system had advantages over the French one) did not think the idea of raising money by subscription to be a good one, and supported Daguerre by arranging for motions to be passed in both Houses of the French parliament.

Daguerre did not patent and profit from his invention in the usual way. Instead, it was arranged that the French government would acquire the rights in exchange for lifetime pensions to Daguerre and to Niépce&#x27;s son and heir, Isidore. The government would then present the daguerreotype process &quot;free to the world&quot; as a gift, which it did on 19 August 1839. However, five days previous to this, Miles Berry, a patent agent acting on Daguerre&#x27;s behalf filed for patent No. 8194 of 1839: &quot;A New or Improved Method of Obtaining the Spontaneous Reproduction of all the Images Received in the Focus of the Camera Obscura&quot;. The patent applied to &quot;England, Wales, and the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, and in all her Majesty&#x27;s Colonies and Plantations abroad&quot;. This was the usual wording of English patent specifications before 1852. It was only after the 1852 Act, which unified the patent systems of England, Ireland and Scotland, that a single patent protection was automatically extended to the whole of the British Isles, including the Channel Isles and the Isle of Man. Richard Beard bought the patent rights from Miles Berry, and also obtained a Scottish patent, which he apparently did not enforce. The United Kingdom and the &quot;Colonies and Plantations abroad&quot; therefore became the only places where a license was legally required to make and sell daguerreotypes.

Although Daguerre&#x27;s early work survived when his studio caught fire on 8 March 1839, while the painter Samuel Morse was visiting from the US, fewer than 25 of them are known to be around today.

== &quot;Camera obscura&quot; ==

The &quot;camera obscura&quot; (Latin for &quot;dark chamber&quot;) in its simplest form is a naturally occurring phenomenon.

A broad-leaved tree in bright sunshine will provide conditions that fulfill the requirements of a pinhole camera or a camera obscura: a bright light source (the sun), the shade that the leafy canopy provides, a flat surface onto which the image is projected and holes formed by the gaps between the leaves. The sun&#x27;s image will show as a round disc, and, in a partial eclipse, as a crescent.

A clear description of a camera obscura is given by Leonardo da Vinci in Codex Atlanticus (1502): (he called it &quot;oculus artificialis&quot; which means &quot;the artificial eye&quot;)If the facade of a building, or a place, or a landscape is illuminated by the sun and a small hole is drilled in the wall of a room in a building facing this, which is not directly lighted by the sun, then all objects illuminated by the sun will send their images through this aperture and will appear, upside down, on the wall facing the hole.

In another notebook, he wrote:You will catch these pictures on a piece of white paper, which placed vertically in the room not far from that opening, and you will see all the above-mentioned objects on this paper in their natural shapes or colors, but they will appear smaller and upside down, on account of crossing of the rays at that aperture. If these pictures originate from a place which is illuminated by the sun, they will appear colored on the paper exactly as they are. The paper should be very thin and must be viewed from the back.

In the 16th century, Daniele Barbaro suggested replacing the small hole with a larger hole and an old man&#x27;s spectacle lens (a biconvex lens for correcting long-sightedness), which produced a much brighter and sharper image.

By the late 18th century, small, easily portable box-form units equipped with a simple lens, an internal mirror, and a ground glass screen had become popular among affluent amateurs for making sketches of landscapes and architecture. The camera was pointed at the scene and steadied, a sheet of thin paper was placed on top of the ground glass, then a pencil or pen could be used to trace over the image projected from within. The beautiful but fugitive little light-paintings on the screen inspired several people to seek some way of capturing them more completely and effectively—and automatically—by means of chemistry.

Daguerre, a skilled professional artist, was familiar with the &quot;camera obscura&quot; as an aid for establishing correct proportion and perspective, sometimes very useful when planning out the celebrated theatrical scene backdrops he painted and the even larger ultra-realistic panoramas he exhibited in his popular Diorama.

== Process ==

The chemistry of the daguerrotype resembles the modern gelatin silver process, beginning with silver halides which are formed in darkness before being exposed to light, forming a latent image which is then developed into a visible form, before being fixed using sodium thiosulfate (&quot;hypo&quot;). The notable distinguishing features of the daguerrotype process are the formation of silver halides directly on a surface of metallic silver, and the development by exposure to mercury vapour. 

=== Plate manufacture ===
The daguerreotype image is formed on a highly polished silver surface. Usually the silver is a thin layer on a copper substrate, but other metals such as brass can be used for the substrate and daguerreotypes can also be made on solid silver sheets. A surface of very pure silver is preferable, but sterling (92.5% pure) or US coin (90% pure) or even lower grades of silver are functional. In 19th century practice, the usual stock material, Sheffield plate, was produced by a process sometimes called plating by fusion. A sheet of sterling silver was heat-fused onto the top of a thick copper ingot. When the ingot was repeatedly rolled under pressure to produce thin sheets, the relative thicknesses of the two layers of metal remained constant. The alternative was to electroplate a layer of pure silver onto a bare copper sheet. The two technologies were sometimes combined, the Sheffield plate being given a finishing coat of pure silver by electroplating.

In order that the corners of the plate would not tear the buffing material when the plate was polished, the edges of the plate were bent back using patented devices that could also serve as plate holders to avoid touching the surface of the plate during processing.

==== Polishing ====
To optimize the image quality of the end product, the silver side of the plate had to be polished to as nearly perfect a mirror finish as possible. The silver had to be completely free of tarnish or other contamination when it was sensitized, so the daguerreotypist had to perform at least the final portion of the polishing and cleaning operation not too long before use. 

In the 19th century, the polishing was done with a buff covered with hide or velvet, first using rotten stone, then jeweler&#x27;s rouge, then lampblack. Originally, the work was entirely manual, but buffing machinery was soon devised to assist. Finally, the surface was swabbed with nitric acid to burn off any residual organic matter.

==== Sensitization ====
In darkness, or by the light of a safelight, the silver surface was exposed to halogen fumes to form a silver halide. Originally, only iodine fumes (from iodine crystals at room temperature) were used, producing a surface coating of silver iodide, but it was soon found that a subsequent exposure to bromine fumes greatly increased the sensitivity of the silver halide coating. Exposure to chlorine fumes, or a combination of bromine and chlorine fumes, could also be used. A final re-fuming with iodine was typical.

=== Exposure ===
The plate was then carried to the camera in a light-tight plate holder. Withdrawing a protective dark slide or opening a pair of doors in the holder exposed the sensitized surface within the dark camera and removing a cap from the camera lens began the exposure, creating an invisible latent image on the plate. Depending on the sensitization chemistry used, the brightness of the lighting, and the light-concentrating power of the lens, the required exposure time ranged from a few seconds to many minutes. After the exposure was judged to be complete, the lens was capped and the holder was again made light-tight and removed from the camera.

=== Development ===
The latent image was developed to visibility by several minutes of exposure to the fumes given off by heated mercury in a purpose-made developing box. 

The toxicity of mercury was well known in the 19th century, but precautionary measures were rarely taken. Today, however, the hazards of contact with mercury and other chemicals traditionally used in the daguerreotype process are taken more seriously, as is the risk of release of those chemicals into the environment.

==== Becquerel variation ====
In the Becquerel variation of the process, published in 1840 but very rarely used in the 19th century, the plate, sensitized by fuming with iodine alone, was developed by overall exposure to sunlight passing through yellow, amber or red glass. The silver iodide in its unexposed condition was insensitive to the red end of the visible spectrum of light and was unaffected, but the latent image created in the camera by the blue, violet and ultraviolet rays color-sensitized each point on the plate proportionally, so that this color-filtered &quot;sunbath&quot; intensified it to full visibility, as if the plate had been exposed in the camera for hours or days to produce a visible image without development. Becquerel daguerreotypes, when fully developed and fixed, typically take on a somewhat bluish hue. The image quality may not be as magnificently sharp as a daguerreotype developed using mercury vapor, although modern photographers pursuing daguerreotypy tend to favor the Becquerel process due to the hazards and expense of working with mercury. 

=== Fixing ===
After development, the light sensitivity of the plate was arrested by removing the unexposed silver halide with a mild solution of sodium thiosulfate; Daguerre&#x27;s initial method was to use a hot saturated solution of common salt.

Gilding, also called gold toning, was an addition to Daguerre&#x27;s process introduced by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1840. It soon became part of the standard procedure. To give the steely gray image a slightly warmer tone and physically reinforce the powder-like silver particles of which it was composed, a gold chloride solution was pooled onto the surface and the plate was briefly heated over a flame, then drained, rinsed and dried. Without this treatment, the image was as delicate as the &quot;dust&quot; on a butterfly&#x27;s wing.

== Casing and other display options ==
Even when strengthened by gilding, the image surface was still very easily marred and air would tarnish the silver, so the finished plate was bound up with a protective cover glass and sealed with strips of paper soaked in gum arabic. In the US and UK, a gilt brass mat called a preserver in the US and a pinchbeck in Britain, was normally used to separate the image surface from the glass. In continental Europe, a thin cardboard mat or &quot;passepartout&quot; usually served that purpose.

There were two main methods of finishing daguerreotypes for protection and display:

In the US and Britain, the tradition of preserving miniature paintings in a wooden case covered with leather or paper stamped with a relief pattern continued through to the daguerreotype. Some daguerreotypists were portrait artists who also offered miniature portraits. Black-lacquered cases ornamented with inset mother of pearl were sometimes used. The more substantial Union case was made from a mixture of colored sawdust and shellac (the main component of wood varnish) formed in a heated mold to produce a decorative sculptural relief. The word &quot;Union&quot; referred to the sawdust and varnish mixture—the manufacture of Union cases began in 1856. In all types of cases, the inside of the cover was lined with velvet or plush or satin to provide a dark surface to reflect into the plate for viewing and to protect the cover glass. Some cases, however, held two daguerreotypes opposite each other. The cased images could be set out on a table or displayed on a mantelpiece. Most cases were small and lightweight enough to easily carry in a pocket, although that was not normally done. The other approach, common in France and the rest of continental Europe, was to hang the daguerreotype on the wall in a frame, either simple or elaborate.

Conservators were able to determine that a daguerreotype of Walt Whitman was made in New Orleans with the main clue being the type of frame, which was made for wall hanging in the French and continental style. Supporting evidence of the New Orleans origin was a scrap of paper from &quot;Le Mesager&quot;, a New Orleans bilingual newspaper of the time, which had been used to glue the plate into the frame. Other clues used by historians to identify daguerreotypes are hallmarks in the silver plate and the distinctive patterns left by different photographers when polishing the plate with a leather buff, which leaves extremely fine parallel lines discernible on the surface.

As the daguerreotype itself is on a relatively thin sheet of soft metal, it was easily sheared down to sizes and shapes suited for mounting into lockets, as was done with miniature paintings. Other imaginative uses of daguerreotype portraits were to mount them in watch fobs and watch cases, jewel caskets and other ornate silver or gold boxes, the handles of walking sticks, and in brooches, bracelets and other jewelry now referred to by collectors as &quot;daguerreian jewelry&quot;. The cover glass or crystal was sealed either directly to the edges of the daguerreotype or to the opening of its receptacle and a protective hinged cover was usually provided.

== Unusual characteristics ==
Daguerreotypes are normally laterally reversed—mirror images—because they are necessarily viewed from the side that originally faced the camera lens. Although a daguerreotypist could attach a mirror or reflective prism in front of the lens to obtain a right-reading result, in practice this was rarely done.

The use of either type of attachment caused some light loss, somewhat increasing the required exposure time, and unless they were of very high optical quality they could degrade the quality of the image. Right-reading text or right-handed buttons on men&#x27;s clothing in a daguerreotype may be the only evidence that the specimen is a copy of a typical wrong-reading original.

The experience of viewing a daguerreotype is unlike that of viewing any other type of photograph. The image does not sit on the surface of the plate. After flipping from positive to negative as the viewing angle is adjusted, viewers experience an apparition in space, a mirage that arises once the eyes are properly focused. When reproduced via other processes, this effect associated with viewing an original daguerreotype will no longer be apparent. Other processes that have a similar viewing experience are holograms on credit cards or Lippmann plates.

Although daguerreotypes are unique images, they could be copied by re-daguerreotyping the original. Copies were also produced by lithography or engraving. Today, they can be digitally scanned.

A well-exposed and sharp large-format daguerreotype is able to faithfully record fine detail at a resolution that 2000&#x27;s digital cameras were not able to match.

== Reduction of exposure time ==
In the early 1840s, two innovations were introduced that dramatically shortened the required exposure times: a lens that produced a much brighter image in the camera, and a modification of the chemistry used to sensitize the plate.

The first daguerreotype cameras could not be used for portraiture, as the exposure time required would have been too long. The cameras were fitted with Chevalier lenses which were &quot;slow&quot; (about f/14). They projected a sharp and undistorted but dim image onto the plate. Such a lens was necessary in order to produce the highly detailed results which had elicited so much astonishment and praise when daguerreotypes were first exhibited, results which the purchasers of daguerreotype equipment expected to achieve. Using this lens and the original sensitizing method, an exposure of several minutes was required to photograph even a very brightly sunlit scene. A much &quot;faster&quot; lens could have been provided—simply omitting the integral fixed diaphragm from the Chevalier lens would have increased its working aperture to about f/4.7 and reduced the exposure time by nearly 90 percent—but because of the existing state of lens design the much shorter exposure would have been at the cost of a peripherally distorted and very much less clear image. With uncommon exceptions, daguerreotypes made before 1841 were of static subjects such as landscapes, buildings, monuments, statuary, and still life arrangements. Attempts at portrait photography with the Chevalier lens required the sitter to face into the sun for several minutes while trying to remain motionless and look pleasant, usually producing repulsive and unflattering results. The Woolcott mirror lens that produced tiny, postage stamp size daguerreotypes made portraiture with the daguerreotype process possible and these were the first photographic portraits to be produced. In 1841, the Petzval Portrait Lens was introduced. Professor Andreas von Ettingshausen brought the need for a faster lens for daguerreotype cameras to his colleague, Professor Petzval&#x27;s attention, who went ahead in cooperation with the Voigtländer firm to design a lens that would reduce the time needed to expose daguerreotype plates for portraiture. Petzval was not aware of the scale of his invention at the start of his work on the lens, and later regretted not having secured his rights by obtaining letters patent on his invention. It was the first lens to be designed using mathematical computation, and a team of mathematicians whose specialty was in fact calculating the trajectories of ballistics was put at Petzval&#x27;s disposal by the Archduke Ludwig. It was scientifically designed and optimized for its purpose. With a working aperture of about f/3.6, an exposure only about one-fifteenth as long as that required when using a Chevalier lens was sufficient. Although it produced an acceptably sharp image in the central area of the plate, where the sitter&#x27;s face was likely to be, the image quality dropped off toward the edges, so for this and other reasons it was unsuitable for landscape photography and not a general replacement for Chevalier-type lenses. Petzval intended his lens to be convertible with two alternative rear components: one for portraiture and the other for landscape and architecture.

The other major innovation was a chemical one. In Daguerre&#x27;s original process, the plate was sensitized by exposure to iodine fumes alone. A breakthrough came with the discovery that when exposure to bromine or chlorine fumes was correctly combined with this, the sensitivity of the plate could be greatly increased, which in turn greatly reduced the required exposure time to between fifteen and thirty seconds in favorable lighting conditions, according to Eder. Several experimenters discovered the propensity of using chlorine and bromine in addition to iodine: Wolcott, whose &quot;Wolcott&#x27;s mixture&quot; was marketed by his partner, John Johnson that they called &quot;quickstuff&quot;; two unrelated individuals with the surname Goddard – Philadelphia physician and chemist Paul Beck Goddard, and John Frederick Goddard who lectured at the Adelaide Gallery before assisting Beard with setting up the first daguerreotype portraiture studio on the roof of the Regent Street Polytechnic; (John Frederick Goddard was the first to publish information that bromine increased the sensitivity of daguerreotype plates in the &quot;Literary Gazette&quot; of 12 December 1840) and in Vienna: Krachowila and the Natterer brothers.

== Unusual daguerreotype cameras ==
A number of innovative camera designs appeared:

By December 1839, Carl August von Steinheil invented a small, portable metal camera, which was one-twentieth the size of the camera sold by Giroux. The resulting daguerreotypes were viewed in a special brass viewer. At least ten of these cameras were created.

One early attempt to address the lack of a good &quot;fast&quot; lens for portraiture, and the subject of the first US patent for photographic apparatus, was Alexander S. Wolcott&#x27;s camera, which used a concave mirror instead of a lens and operated on the principle of the reflecting telescope. The mirror was fitted at one end of the camera and focusing was done by adjusting the position of the plate in a holder that slid along a rail. Designed solely for portraiture, this arrangement produced a far brighter image than a Chevalier lens, or even the later Petzval lens, but image quality was only marginal and the design was only practical for use with small plates.

Friedrich Voigtländer&#x27;s small, all-metal Daguerrotype camera (1841) was small enough to be carried. It was fitted with a f/3.5 Petzval portrait lens at the front and a focusing lens at the back, and took round plates. Only 600 of these cameras were produced.

The directions for the use of the Voigtländer camera read as follows:

Directions for the use of the new daguerreotype apparatus for the making of portraits, executed according to the calculations of Professor Petzval by Voigtländer and Son, Vienna, printed by J.P.Sollinger, August 1, 1841.

The person to be photographed must be seated in the open air. For an exposure by overcast, dark skies in winter 3 ½ minutes is sufficient; on a sunny day in the shade 1½ to 2 minutes are enough, and in direct sunlight it requires no more than 40–45 seconds. The last, however, is seldom employed on account of the deep shadows direct sunlight creates. 

The stated exposure times are evidently for plates sensitized with iodine only; improved sensitization methods were just being introduced in 1841–42.

In 1845 Friedrich von Martens invented the first panoramic camera for curved daguerreotype plates with a lens that turned to cover an angle of 150 degrees. It was called &quot;Megaskop-Kamera&quot; of &quot;Panorama-Kamera&quot;.

Netto constructed, in 1841, a studio in which the front part of the camera with the lens was built into the wall between the studio and the adjoining darkroom, the rear part of the camera being inside the darkroom.

== Portraiture ==
In one early attempt at portraiture, a Swedish amateur daguerreotypist caused his sitter nearly to lose an eye because of practically staring into the sun during the five-minute exposure.

Even with fast lenses and much more sensitive plates, under portrait studio lighting conditions an exposure of several seconds was necessary on the brightest of days, and on hazy or cloudy days the sitter had to remain still for considerably longer. The head rest was already in use for portrait painting.

Establishments producing daguerreotype portraits generally had a daylight studio built on the roof, much like a greenhouse. Whereas later in the history of photography artificial electric lighting was done in a dark room, building up the light with hard spotlights and softer floodlights, the daylight studio was equipped with screens and blinds to control the light, to reduce it and make it unidirectional, or diffuse it to soften harsh direct lighting. Blue filtration was sometimes used to make it easier for the sitter to tolerate the strong light, as a daguerreotype plate was almost exclusively sensitive to light at the blue end of the spectrum and filtering out everything else did not significantly increase the exposure time.

Usually, it was arranged so that sitters leaned their elbows on a support such as a posing table, the height of which could be adjusted, or else head rests were used that did not show in the picture, and this led to most daguerreotype portraits having stiff, lifeless poses. Some exceptions exist, with lively expressions full of character, as photographers saw the potential of the new medium, and would have used the tableau vivant technique. These are represented in museum collections and are the most sought after by private collectors today. In the case of young children, their mothers were sometimes hidden in the frame, to calm them and keep them still so as to prevent blurring.
The image in a daguerreotype is often described as being formed by the amalgam, or alloy, of mercury and silver because mercury vapor from a pool of heated mercury is used to develop the plate; but using the Becquerel process (using a red filter and extra exposure) daguerreotypes can be produced without mercury, and chemical analysis shows that there is no mercury in the final image with the Becquerel process. This brings into question the theory that the image is formed of amalgam with mercury development.

Although the daguerreotype process could only produce a single image at a time, copies could be created by re-daguerreotyping the original. As with any original photograph that is copied, the contrast increases. With a daguerreotype, any writing will appear back to front. Recopying a daguerreotype will make the writing appear normal and rings worn on the fingers will appear on the correct hand. Another device to make a daguerreotype the right way round would be to use a mirror when taking the photograph.

The daguerreotypes of the 1852 Omaha Indian (Native American) delegation in the Smithsonian include a daguerreotype copied in the camera, recognizable by the contrast being high and a black line down the side of the plate.

== Proliferation ==

André-Adolphe-Eugène Disdéri and Jules Itier of France, and Johann Baptist Isenring of Switzerland, became prominent daguerreotypists. In Britain, however, Richard Beard bought the British daguerreotype patent from Miles Berry in 1841 and closely controlled his investment, selling licenses throughout the country and prosecuting infringers. Among others, Antoine Claudet and Thomas Richard Williams produced daguerreotypes in the UK.
Daguerreotype photography spread rapidly across the United States after the discovery first appeared in US newspapers in February 1839.
 In the early 1840s, the invention was introduced in a period of months to practitioners in the United States by Samuel Morse, inventor of the telegraph code.

It is possible that Morse may have been the first American to view a daguerreotype first-hand. Morse&#x27;s experience with art and technology in the early 1800s attracted him to the daguerreotype; in the summers of 1820 and 1821 he conducted proto-photographic experiments with Benjamin Silliman. In his piece The Gallery of the Louvre Morse used a Camera obscura to precisely capture the gallery which he then used to create the final painting.

Morse met the inventor of the daguerreotype, Louis-Jacques-Mande Daguerre, in Paris in January 1839 when Daguerre&#x27;s invention was announced. While the daguerreotype fascinated Morse, he was concerned about how the new invention would compete with his telegraph. However, Morse&#x27;s viewing of the daguerreotype alleviated his fears when he saw how revolutionary its technology was. Morse wrote a letter to his brother Sidney describing Daguerre&#x27;s invention, which Sidney then published in the New-York Observer on April 20, 1839. While this was not the first report of the daguerreotype to appear in America, it was the first in-person report to appear in the United States.

Morse&#x27;s account of the brand-new invention interested the American public, and through further publishings the technique of the daguerreotype was integrated into the United States. Magazines and newspapers included essays applauding the daguerreotype for advancing democratic American values because it could create an image without painting, which was less efficient and more expensive. The introduction of the daguerreotype to America also promoted progress of ideals and technology. For example, an article published in the Boston Daily Advertiser on February 23, 1839 described the daguerreotype as having similar properties of the camera obscura, but introduced its remarkable capability of &quot;fixing the image permanently on the paper, or making a permanent drawing, by the agency of light alone,&quot; which combined old and new concepts for readers to understand.

By 1853, an estimated three million daguerreotypes per year were being produced in the United States alone. One of these original Morse Daguerreotype cameras is currently on display at the National Museum of American History, a branch of the Smithsonian Institution, in Washington, D.C. A flourishing market in portraiture sprang up, predominantly the work of itinerant practitioners who traveled from town to town. For the first time in history, people could obtain an exact likeness of themselves or their loved ones for a modest cost, making portrait photographs extremely popular with those of modest means. Celebrities and everyday people sought portraits and workers would save an entire day&#x27;s income to have a daguerreotype taken of them, including occupational portraits.

Notable U.S. daguerreotypists of the mid-19th century included James Presley Ball, Samuel Bemis, Abraham Bogardus, Mathew Brady, Thomas Martin Easterly, François Fleischbein, Jeremiah Gurney, John Plumbe, Jr., Albert Southworth, Augustus Washington, Ezra Greenleaf Weld, John Adams Whipple, and Frederick Douglass.

This method spread to other parts of the world as well:
* The first daguerreotype in Australia was taken in 1841, but no longer survives. The oldest surviving Australian daguerreotype is a portrait of Dr. William Bland taken in 1845.
* In Jamaica Adolphe Duperly, a Frenchman, produced a booklet of Daguerreotypes, &quot;Daguerian Excursions in Jamaica, being a collection of views ... taken on the spot with the Daguerreotype&quot; which probably appeared in 1844.
* In 1857, Ichiki Shirō created the first known Japanese photograph, a portrait of his &quot;daimyō&quot; Shimazu Nariakira. The photograph was designated an Important Cultural Property by the government of Japan.
*In the early 1850s, Augustus Washington left Hartford Connecticut to eventually take daguerreotypes for the political leaders of Monrovia, Liberia. He then went on to be elected as a speaker of the Liberian House of Representatives and later a member of the Liberian Senate.

== Astronomical applications in the 19th century ==
In 1839, François Arago had in his address to the French Chamber of Deputies outlined a wealth of possible applications including astronomy, and indeed the daguerreotype was still occasionally used for astronomical photography in the 1870s.

The first known photograph of a solar eclipse was taken on July 28, 1851, by Johann Julius Friedrich Berkowski, using the daguerreotype process.

Although the collodion wet plate process offered a cheaper and more convenient alternative for commercial portraiture and for other applications with shorter exposure times, when the transit of Venus was about to occur and observations were to be made from several sites on the earth&#x27;s surface in order to calculate astronomical distances, daguerreotypy proved a more accurate method of making visual recordings through telescopes because it was a dry process with greater dimensional stability, whereas collodion glass plates were exposed wet and the image would become slightly distorted when the emulsion dried.

== Late and modern use ==
Although the daguerreotype process is sometimes said to have died out completely in the early 1860s, documentary evidence indicates that some very slight use of it persisted more or less continuously throughout the following 150 years of its supposed extinction. A few first-generation daguerreotypists refused to entirely abandon their old medium when they started making the new, cheaper, easier to view but comparatively drab ambrotypes and tintypes. Historically minded photographers of subsequent generations, often fascinated by daguerreotypes, sometimes experimented with making their own or even revived the process commercially as a &quot;retro&quot; portraiture option for their clients. These eccentric late uses were extremely unusual and surviving examples reliably dated to between the 1860s and the 1960s are now exceedingly rare.

The daguerreotype experienced a minor renaissance in the late 20th century and the process is currently practiced by a handful of enthusiastic devotees; there are thought to be fewer than 100 worldwide (see list of artists on cdags.org in links below). In recent years, artists like Jerry Spagnoli, Adam Fuss, Patrick Bailly-Maître-Grand, Alyssa C. Salomon, and Chuck Close have reintroduced the medium to the broader art world. The use of electronic flash in modern daguerreotype has solved many of the problems connected with the slow speed of the process when using daylight.

International group exhibitions of contemporary daguerreotypists&#x27; works have been held, notably the 2009 exhibition in Bry Sur Marne, France, with 182 daguerreotypes by forty-four artists, and the 2013 ImageObject exhibition in New York City, showcasing seventy-five works by thirty-three artists. The Astolat Dollhouse Castle also displays daguerreotypes. The appeal of the medium lies in the &quot;magic mirror&quot; effect of light striking the polished silver plate and revealing a silvery image which can seem ghostly and ethereal even while being perfectly sharp, and in the dedication and handcrafting required to make a daguerreotype.

<doc id="103178" wikidata="Q816220" url="?curid=103178" title="D.C. sniper attacks">
<text>The D.C. sniper attacks (also known as the Beltway sniper attacks) were a series of coordinated shootings that occurred during three weeks in October 2002 throughout the Washington metropolitan area, consisting of the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, and preliminary shootings, that consisted of murders and robberies in several states, and lasted for six months starting in February 2002. Seven people were killed, and seven others were injured in the preliminary shootings, and ten people were killed and three others were critically wounded in the October shootings. In total, the snipers killed 17 people and wounded 10 others in a 10-month span.

The snipers were two men, John Allen Muhammad (41 years old at the time) and Lee Boyd Malvo (17 years old at the time), who traveled in a blue 1990 Chevrolet Caprice sedan.

In 2003, Muhammad was sentenced to death, and in 2009, he was executed by lethal injection. Malvo, a juvenile, received six life sentences in Maryland and three in Virginia. In 2017, Malvo&#x27;s life sentences in Virginia were vacated without parole on appeal.

==Preliminary shootings==
On February 16, 2002, 21-year-old Keenya Nicole Cook was shot and killed by Lee Malvo at the front door of her aunt&#x27;s home in Tacoma, Washington. Cook&#x27;s aunt, Isa Nichols, had been good friends with John Allen Muhammad&#x27;s ex-wife Mildred and had encouraged her to seek a divorce.

On March 19, 2002, Jerry Taylor, 60, was killed by a single shot to the chest fired from long range as he practiced chip shots at a Tucson, Arizona, golf course. Muhammad&#x27;s sister lived near the golf course, and he was visiting her at the time of the shooting.

On August 1, 2002, John Gaeta, 51, was changing a tire slashed by Malvo at a parking lot in Hammond, Louisiana. Malvo then shot him in the neck. The bullet exited through Gaeta&#x27;s back, and he pretended to be dead while Malvo stole his wallet. Gaeta ran to a service station after Malvo left and discovered that he was bleeding; he went to a hospital and was released within an hour. 

On September 5, 2002, at 10:30p.m., Paul LaRuffa, a 55-year-old pizzeria owner, was shot six times at close range while locking up his Italian restaurant in Clinton, Maryland. LaRuffa survived the shooting, and his laptop computer was found in Muhammad&#x27;s car when he and Malvo were arrested.

On September 14, 2002, 22-year-old Rupinder &quot;Benny&quot; Oberoi, an employee of the Hillandale Beer &amp; Wine liquor store in Silver Spring, Maryland, was shot in the back outside the store. Oberoi survived the shooting. The shooting was officially linked to Muhammad and Malvo by the Montgomery County Police Department.

On September 15, 2002, Muhammad Rashid was shot while closing Three Roads Liquors in Brandywine, Maryland. Rashid later identified Malvo as the shooter in court.

On September 21, 2002, at 12:15a.m., 41-year-old Million A. Waldemariam was fatally shot in the head and back with a .22-caliber pistol in Atlanta, Georgia. Waldemariam was helping the owner of a Sammy&#x27;s Package Store close up for the night when the shooting occurred.

Nineteen hours later on the same day, Claudine Parker, a 52-year-old liquor store clerk in Montgomery, Alabama, was shot in the chest and killed during a robbery. Her coworker, 24-year-old Kellie Adams, was critically wounded with a shot through the neck but survived. Evidence found at the crime scene eventually tied this killing to the Beltway attacks and allowed authorities to identify Muhammad and Malvo as suspects, although this connection was not made until October 17, almost four weeks later.

On September 23, 2002, at 6:30p.m., 45-year-old Hong Im Ballenger was shot in the head and killed with a Bushmaster rifle in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Muhammad and Malvo were later linked to the killing.

==Attacks in the Washington, D.C. area==

===Washington, D.C. and Montgomery County, Maryland===
At 5:20p.m. on Wednesday, October 2, 2002, a shot was fired through the window of a Michaels craft store in Aspen Hill, Maryland. The bullet narrowly missed Ann Chapman, a cashier at the store. Since no one was injured, the shot was assumed to be random, and no serious alarms were raised. However, approximately one hour later, at 6:30p.m., James Martin, a 55-year-old program analyst at NOAA, was shot and killed at 2201 Randolph Road, in the parking lot of a Shoppers Food Warehouse grocery store located in Wheaton.

On the morning of October 3, four people were shot dead within a span of approximately two hours in Aspen Hill and other nearby areas in Montgomery County. Another was killed that evening in the Takoma neighborhood of the District of Columbia:
* At 7:41a.m., James L. Buchanan, a 39-year-old landscaper known as &quot;Sonny&quot;, was shot dead at 11411 Rockville Pike, near Rockville, Maryland. Buchanan was shot while mowing the grass at the Fitzgerald Auto Malls.
* At 8:12a.m., a 54-year-old part-time taxi driver, Prem Kumar Walekar, was killed in Aspen Hill in Montgomery County, while pumping gasoline into his taxi at a Mobil station at Aspen Hill Road and Connecticut Avenue.
* At 8:37a.m., Sarah Ramos, a 34-year-old babysitter and housekeeper, was killed at the Leisure World Shopping Center in Norbeck. She had gotten off a bus at Connecticut Avenue and was seated on a bench reading a book at the time of her murder.
* At 9:58a.m., 25-year-old Lori Ann Lewis-Rivera was killed while vacuuming her Plymouth Grand Voyager at the Shell station at the intersection of Connecticut and Knowles Avenues in Kensington, Maryland.
* The snipers waited until 9:20p.m. before shooting Pascal Charlot, a 72-year-old retired carpenter, while he was walking on Georgia Avenue at Kalmia Road, in Washington, D.C. Charlot died less than an hour later.

In each shooting, the victims were killed by a single bullet fired from some distance, and, in each case, the killers struck and vanished. This pattern was not detected until after the October3 shootings occurred.

Fear quickly spread throughout the region as news of the shootings spread. At a press conference meeting, Chief of Police for Montgomery County, Charles Moose, informed parents that schools were on a code blue alert, keeping children indoors. He said that the schools were safe. Many parents picked up their children early at school, not allowing them to take a school bus or walk home. Montgomery County Public Schools, District of Columbia Public Schools, and private schools went into a lockdown, with no recess or outdoor physical education classes. Other school districts in the area also took precautionary measures, keeping students indoors. During the course of the shootings, law enforcement agencies from neighboring states became embedded in the investigation through telephone tips.

Police had only a few pieces of evidence to work with. One initial report said that right after the Silver Spring attack someone had reportedly heard a popping noise and had seen a white box truck hurriedly leaving the scene. After the murder in Washington, D.C., witnesses began telling police that they had seen a blue Chevrolet Caprice rather than a white box truck. The police initially believed that all of the murders were carried out with a .223 caliber rifle.

===Virginia and other areas===
At this point, Malvo and Muhammad started covering a wider area and taking two or three days between shootings:

* On October 4, 43-year-old homemaker Caroline Seawell was shot and wounded in the chest at 2:30p.m. in the parking lot of another Michaels store at Spotsylvania Mall in Spotsylvania, while she was loading purchases into her minivan. By this point, hundreds of journalists had converged to cover the unfolding events. School officials reassured the public that they were taking every measure possible to protect children, by tightening security and canceling all outdoor activities. The weekend passed without incident, but when lessons resumed, so did the shootings.
* On October 7, at 8:09a.m., Iran Brown, a 13-year-old student, was shot in the chest and critically wounded as he arrived at Benjamin Tasker Middle School on 4901 Collington Road in Bowie, Maryland, in Prince George&#x27;s County Brown survived the attack and ultimately testified at Muhammad&#x27;s trial. At this crime scene, the authorities discovered a shell casing as well as a Tarot card (the Death card) inscribed with the phrase &quot;Call me God&quot; on the front and, on three separate lines on the back: &quot;For you mr. Police.&quot; &quot;Code: &#x27;Call me God&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Do not release to the press.&quot; Despite police efforts to honor the request not to release information about the card to the press, details were made public by WUSA-TV and then by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, just one day later.
* On October 9 at 8:18p.m., 53-year-old civil engineer Dean Harold Meyers was shot dead while pumping gasoline at a Sunoco gas station on 7203 Sudley Road in Prince William County, Virginia, near the city of Manassas.
* On the morning of October 11 at 9:30a.m., 53-year-old businessman Kenneth Bridges was shot dead while pumping fuel at an Exxon station off Interstate 95 in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, near Fredericksburg.
* On October 14, at 9:15p.m., 47-year-old Linda Franklin (née Moore), an FBI intelligence analyst who was a resident of Arlington County, Virginia, was shot dead in a covered parking lot at Home Depot in Fairfax County, Virginia, just outside Falls Church at Seven Corners Shopping Center. The police received what seemed to be a very good lead after the October 14 shooting, but it was later determined that the witness was inside the Home Depot at the time and was lying. The witness, Matthew Dowdy, was subsequently convicted of interfering with the investigation.

By this point due to public concerns about safety, gas stations had begun to put tarps up to conceal their customers (see below). Some people crouched over to pump gas, while others waited in their cars. Malvo and Muhammad did not commit any more shootings for five days before striking again.

On October 19 at 8:00p.m., 37-year-old Jeffrey Hopper was shot in a parking lot near the Ponderosa Steakhouse at State Route 54 in Ashland, Virginia, about south of Washington, near Interstate 95. His wife Stephanie called out to passersby, who phoned for an ambulance, enabling Hopper to survive his injuries. Authorities discovered a four-page letter from the shooter in the woods that demanded $10 million and made a threat to children.

On October 21, Richmond-area police arrested two men, one with a white van, outside a gas station. The men turned out to be undocumented immigrants with no connection to the shooter. The pair were subjected to cavity searches and remanded into federal custody (what was then the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which subsequently deported them).

On the next day, October 22, Ride On bus driver Conrad Johnson, 35, was shot at 5:56a.m. while standing on the steps at the 14100 block of Grand Pre Road in Aspen Hill, Maryland. Johnson died of his injuries. On the same day, Chief Moose released part of the content of one of the shooter&#x27;s letters, in which he declares, &quot;Your children are not safe, anywhere, at any time.&quot;

While no shootings occurred on October 23, the day is significant for two events. First, ballistics experts confirmed Johnson as the 10th fatality in the Beltway shootings. Second, in a yard in Takoma Park, Maryland, police searched with metal detectors for bullets, shell casings, or other evidence that might provide a link to the shooters. A tree stump believed to have been used for target practice was seized.

==Public reaction==
With seven shooting victims, including six deaths, in the first 15 hours of the D.C. area spree, the North American media soon devoted extensive coverage to the shootings. By the middle of October 2002, all news television networks provided live coverage of the aftermath of each attack, with the coverage often lasting for hours at a time. The Fox show &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; devoted an entire episode to the shooters in hopes of aiding in their capture. Much of the coverage of the case in &quot;The New York Times&quot; was written by Jayson Blair and subsequently found to be fabricated. The ensuing scandal resulted in the resignations of the newspaper&#x27;s two top editors, Howell Raines and Gerald Boyd.

During the weeks when the attacks occurred, public fear mounted of the apparently random shootings, especially in relation to such sites as service stations and parking lots of large stores, where many had taken place. People pumping gasoline at gas stations kept moving, hoping to present a smaller target. Lisa Notgrass of Lake Jackson, Texas, recommended to media that gas stations put up tarps around the awnings over the fuel pumps, so people would feel safer. Also, many people with access tried to fuel their vehicles at the naval base of the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, as they felt it was safer inside the guarded fence. Government buildings such as the White House, U.S. Capitol, and the Supreme Court building and memorial tourist attractions at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., also received heightened security. For the duration of the attacks, United States Senate pages received a driven police escort to and from the United States Capitol every day and were not allowed to leave their residence hall for any reason except work. Drivers of white vans and box trucks were viewed with suspicion from other motorists as initial media reports indicated the suspect might be driving such a vehicle.

After the specific threat against children was delivered, many school groups curtailed field trips and outdoors athletic activities based upon safety concerns. At the height of the public fear, some school districts, such as Henrico County Public Schools and Hanover County Public Schools, after the Ponderosa shooting, closed school for the day. Other schools, such as the MJBHA, canceled all outdoor activities after the shooting at the Connecticut and Aspen Hill intersection. Others changed after-school procedures for parents to pick up their kids to minimize the amount of time children spent in the open. Extra police officers were placed in schools because of this fear. Joel Schumacher&#x27;s film &quot;Phone Booth&quot; was deemed potentially upsetting enough that its release was delayed until April 2003.

==Investigation==

The investigation was publicly headed by the Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD) and its chief, Charles Moose. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the FBI, the U.S. Secret Service, the Virginia Department of Transportation, and police departments in other jurisdictions where shootings took place provided assistance in the investigation.

Police responded within minutes to reports of attacks during the three weeks of the sniper attacks, cordoning off nearby roads and highways and inspecting all drivers, thereby grinding traffic to a halt for hours at a time. Police canvassed the area, talking to people, and collected surveillance tapes.

By Friday night, October 4, the five shootings on October 3 and two on October 2 were forensically linked to the same gun.

Eyewitness accounts of the attacks were mostly confused and spotty. Hotlines set up for the investigation were flooded with tips. Early tips from eyewitnesses included reports of a white box truck with dark lettering on the outside and two men inside speeding away from the Leisure World shopping center. Police across the area and the state of Maryland were pulling over white vans and trucks. A gray car was spotted speeding away after the October 4 shooting in Spotsylvania.

The shooter attempted to engage the police in a dialogue, compelling Moose to tell the media cryptic messages intended for the sniper. At several scenes of shootings, Tarot cards were left as calling cards, including one Death card upon which was written &quot;Call me God&quot; on the front and on the back, on three separate lines, the words &quot;For you mr. Police.&quot; &quot;Code: &#x27;Call me God&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Do not release to the press.&quot; This information was leaked to the press and misquoted often as &quot;I am God&quot; or similar misquotes of the actual words on the tarot card. At later scenes of crimes the shooter left long, handwritten notes sealed inside plastic bags, including a rambling one that demanded $10,000,000 and threatened the lives of children in the area.

A telephone call from the shooter(s) was traced to a pay telephone at a gasoline station in Henrico County, Virginia. Police missed the suspects by a matter of a few minutes and initially detained occupants of a van at another pay telephone at the same intersection.

On the phone call, the sniper, boasting of his cleverness, mentioned a previous unsolved murder in &quot;Montgomery&quot;. This was identified as the September 21 shooting at a liquor store in Montgomery, Alabama. On October 17 authorities said they matched Malvo&#x27;s fingerprint found at the Benjamin Tasker Middle School site with one lifted from the Montgomery liquor store scene. After confirming the link between these two crime scenes, the FBI was able to link these fingerprints to Malvo due to his fingerprinting during a previous arrest in Washington state. After further research into Malvo&#x27;s background, the police found he had close ties to John Allen Muhammad.

===Difficult progress===

Despite an apparent lack of progress publicly, federal authorities were making significant headway in their investigation and developed leads in Washington state, Alabama, and New Jersey. They learned that Muhammad&#x27;s ex-wife, who had obtained a protective order against him, lived near the Capital Beltway in Clinton, an unincorporated community in suburban Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, adjacent to Montgomery County. Information was also developed about an automobile purchased in New Jersey by Muhammad.

Police discovered that the New Jersey license plate number issued for Muhammad&#x27;s 1990 Chevrolet Caprice had been checked by radio patrol cars several times near shooting locations in various jurisdictions in several states, but the car had not been stopped because law enforcement computer networks did not indicate that it was connected to any criminal activity and they were focused exclusively on the &quot;white van&quot;.

On October 3, 2002, police in Washington, D.C., stopped the Caprice for a &quot;minor traffic infraction&quot; two hours prior to the shooting of Pascal Charlot. Witnesses later reported seeing a Caprice near the scene of his shooting.

On October 8, 2002, Baltimore Police Department investigated a dark blue Chevrolet Caprice parked near the Jones Falls Expressway at 28th Street in Baltimore with a person sleeping inside it. The officers were concerned that the driver&#x27;s license was from Washington state while the vehicle was registered in New Jersey. Although the vehicle was suspicious enough for them to investigate, and it fit the description of a vehicle associated with the shooting in Washington, D.C. five days earlier, the officers did not question the occupants extensively, nor did they search the vehicle.

Authorities were quick to issue a media alert to the public to be on the lookout for a dark blue Chevrolet Caprice sedan. For the public, as well as for law enforcement agencies throughout the region, this was a major change from the mysterious &quot;white box truck&quot; earlier sought based upon reported sightings.

The Chevrolet Caprice was later discovered to have formerly been used as an undercover police car in Bordentown, New Jersey.

===Arrest===


The crime spree came to a close at 3:15 a.m. on October 24, 2002, when Muhammad and Malvo were found sleeping in their car at a rest stop off Interstate 70 near Myersville, Maryland, and were arrested on federal weapons charges. Police were tipped off by two 911 calls from refrigerator mechanic Whitney Donahue at the rest stop. Four hours earlier, Montgomery County police chief Charles Moose had relayed this cryptic message to the sniper: &quot;You have indicated that you want us to do and say certain things. You have asked us to say, &#x27;We have caught the sniper like a duck in a noose.&#x27; We understand that hearing us say this is important to you&quot;. Moose asked the media &quot;to carry the message accurately and often.&quot; This statement may refer to a Cherokee fable.

Trooper First Class D. Wayne Smith of the Maryland State Police was the first to arrive at the scene and immediately used his light blue unmarked police vehicle to block off the exit by positioning the car sideways between two parked tractor-trailers. As more troopers arrived, they effectively sealed off the rest area at both the entrance and exit ramps without the suspects being aware of the rapidly growing police presence. Later, as truck driver Ron Lantz was attempting to exit the rest area, his tractor-trailer was commandeered by troopers who used the truck, in place of the police car, to complete the roadblock at the exit. With the suspects&#x27; escape route sealed off, the SWAT officers moved in to arrest them.

A stolen Bushmaster .223-caliber weapon and bipod were found in a bag in Muhammad&#x27;s car. Ballistics tests later conclusively linked the seized rifle to 11 of the 14 shootings, including one in which no one was hurt.

==Conclusions of investigations==
===Logistics and tactics===

The attacks were carried out with a stolen Bushmaster XM-15 semi-automatic .223 caliber rifle equipped with a Bushnell holographic weapon sight effective at ranges of up to , which was found in the vehicle. The trunk of the Chevrolet Caprice was modified to serve as a &quot;rolling sniper&#x27;s nest&quot;. The back seat was modified to allow a person access to the trunk. Once inside, the sniper could lie prone and take shots through a small hole created for that purpose near the license plate.

===Motive===
Investigators and the prosecution suggested during pre-trial motions that Muhammad intended to kill his second ex-wife Mildred, who he felt had estranged him from his children. According to this hypothesis, the other shootings were intended to cover up the motive for the crime. Muhammad believed that the police would not focus on an estranged ex-husband as a suspect if Mildred appeared to be a random victim of a serial killer. During the attacks, Muhammad frequented the neighborhood where she lived, and some of the incidents occurred nearby. Additionally, he had earlier made threats against her. Mildred herself said that she was his intended target, claiming that when the police first approached her, one officer said, &quot;Ms. Muhammad, didn&#x27;t you know you were the target?&quot; However, Judge LeRoy F. Millette Jr. prevented prosecutors from presenting that theory during the trial, saying that a link had not been firmly established.

While imprisoned, Malvo wrote a number of erratic diatribes about what he termed &quot;jihad&quot; against the United States. &quot;I have been accused on my mission. Allah knows I&#x27;m gonna suffer now,&quot; he wrote. Because his rants and drawings featured not only such figures as Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, but also characters from the film series &quot;The Matrix&quot;, these musings were dismissed as immaterial. Some investigators reportedly said they had all but eliminated terrorist ties or political ideologies as a motive. Nonetheless, in at least one of the ensuing murder trials, a Virginia court found Muhammad guilty of killing &quot;pursuant to the direction or order&quot; of terrorism.

At the 2006 trial of Muhammad, Malvo testified that the aim of the killing spree was to kidnap children for the purpose of extorting money from the government and to &quot;set up a camp to train children how to terrorize cities,&quot; with the ultimate goal being to &quot;shut things down&quot; across the United States. Malvo also stated that Muhammad was driven by his hatred for white people, and his belief that &quot;the white man is the devil&quot;. His plan was to kill six white people per day for thirty days, and he told Malvo he wanted him to shoot pregnant white women.

==Aftermath==

===Criminal prosecutions===

====Virginia trials====
Before the trial, Chief Moose engaged in a publicity tour for his book on the sniper investigation, including appearances on &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;, &quot;The Today Show&quot;, and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Assistant Prince William County Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney James Willett told &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Personally, I don&#x27;t understand why someone who&#x27;s been in law enforcement his whole life would potentially damage our case or compromise a jury pool by doing this.&quot;

Change of venue requests by defense attorneys were granted, and the first trials were held in the independent cities of Chesapeake and Virginia Beach in southeastern Virginia, more than from the closest alleged attack (in Ashland, Virginia).

During their trials in the fall of 2003, involving two of the victims in Virginia, Muhammad and Malvo were each found guilty of murder and weapons charges. The jury in Muhammad&#x27;s case recommended that he be sentenced to death, while Malvo&#x27;s jury recommended a sentence of life in prison without parole instead of a death sentence. The judges concurred in both cases. Alabama law enforcement authorities allege that the snipers engaged in a series of previously unconnected attacks prior to October 2 in Montgomery, Alabama. 

After the initial convictions and sentencing, Will Jarvis, the Assistant Prince William County prosecutor, stated he would wait to decide whether to try Malvo on capital charges in his jurisdiction until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on whether juveniles may be subject to the penalty of execution. While that decision in an unrelated case was still pending before the high court, in October 2004, under a plea agreement, Malvo pleaded guilty in another case in Spotsylvania County, for another murder to avoid a possible death sentence, and agreed to additional sentencing of life imprisonment without parole. Malvo had yet to face trial in Prince William County.

In March 2005, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Roper v. Simmons&quot; that the Eighth Amendment prohibits execution for crimes committed when under the age of 18. In light of this Supreme Court decision, the prosecutors in Prince William County decided not to pursue the charges against Malvo. Prosecutors in Maryland, Louisiana, and Alabama were still interested in putting both Malvo and Muhammad on trial. As Malvo was 17 when he committed the crimes, he could no longer face the death penalty but still could be extradited to Alabama, Louisiana, and other states for prosecution. At the time of the &quot;Roper v. Simmons&quot; ruling, Malvo was 20 years old and was held at Virginia&#x27;s maximum security Red Onion State Prison in Pound, Wise County.

&quot;Muhammad, with his sniper team partner, Malvo, randomly selected innocent victims,&quot; Virginia Supreme Court Justice Donald Lemons wrote in the decision. &quot;With calculation, extensive planning, premeditation and ruthless disregard for life, Muhammad carried out his cruel scheme of terror.&quot;

Muhammad&#x27;s death sentence was affirmed by the Virginia Supreme Court on April 22, 2005, when it ruled that he could be sentenced to death since the murder was part of an act of terrorism. This line of reasoning was based on the handwritten note demanding $10 million. The court rejected an argument by defense lawyers that Muhammad could not be sentenced to death because he was not the triggerman in the killings linked to him and Malvo.

==== Execution of Muhammad ====

On September 16, 2009, the circuit court judge Mary Grace O&#x27;Brien set an execution date by lethal injection of November10, 2009. His attorneys petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to stay his execution, but it was denied. They also requested clemency from Virginia Governor Tim Kaine, but this was denied as well.

Muhammad was executed by lethal injection at the Greensville Correctional Center near Jarratt, Virginia, on November 10, 2009. The execution procedure began at 9:06 p.m. EST; Muhammad was pronounced dead five minutes later. It was reported that when asked if he had any last words, Muhammad made no reply. Twenty-seven people, including victims&#x27; family members, witnessed his execution.

====Maryland trials====

In May 2005, Virginia and Maryland announced that they had reached agreements to allow Maryland to proceed with prosecuting charges there, where the most shootings occurred. There were media reports that Malvo and his legal team were willing to negotiate his cooperation, and he waived extradition to Maryland.

Muhammad and his legal team responded by fighting extradition to Maryland. Muhammad&#x27;s legal team was ultimately unsuccessful, and extradition was ordered by a Virginia judge in August 2005.

Maryland agreed to transfer Muhammad and Malvo back to the Commonwealth of Virginia after their trials. A date for Muhammad&#x27;s pending execution in Virginia had been set for November 10, 2009.

Malvo pleaded guilty to six murders and confessed to others in other states while being interviewed in Maryland and testifying against Muhammad. Malvo was sentenced to six consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole, but in 2017, his sentence in Virginia was overturned after an appeal.

On May 30, 2006, a Maryland jury found John Allen Muhammad guilty of six counts of murder in Maryland. In return, he was sentenced to six consecutive life terms without possibility of parole on June 1, 2006.

On May 6, 2008, it was revealed that Muhammad had asked prosecutors in a letter to help him end legal appeals of his conviction and death sentence &quot;so that you can murder this innocent black man.&quot; An appeal filed by Muhammad&#x27;s defense lawyers in April 2008 cited evidence of brain damage that might render Muhammad incompetent to make legal decisions, and that he should not have been allowed to represent himself at his Virginia trial.

====Malvo testimony====

In John Allen Muhammad&#x27;s May 2006 trial in Montgomery County, Maryland, Lee Boyd Malvo took the stand and confessed to the 17 murders. He also gave a more detailed version of the pair&#x27;s plans. Malvo, after extensive psychological counseling, admitted that he was lying at the earlier Virginia trial where he had admitted to being the trigger man for every shooting. Malvo claimed that he had said this in order to protect Muhammad from a potential death sentence, and because it was more difficult to obtain the death penalty for a minor. Malvo said that he wanted to do what little he could for the families of the victims by letting the full story be told. In his two days of testimony, Malvo outlined detailed aspects of all the shootings.

Part of his testimony concerned Muhammad&#x27;s complete multiphase plan. His plan consisted of three phases in the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore metro areas. Phase one consisted of meticulously planning, mapping, and practicing their locations around the D.C. area. This way, after each shooting they would be able to quickly leave the area on a predetermined path and move on to the next location. Muhammad&#x27;s goal in Phase One was to kill six white people a day for 30 days. Malvo went on to describe how Phase One did not go as planned due to heavy traffic and the lack of a clear shot or getaway at locations.

Phase Two was meant to take place in Baltimore, Maryland. Malvo described how this phase was close to being implemented but was not carried out. Phase Two was intended to begin by killing a pregnant woman by shooting her in the stomach. The next step would have been to shoot and kill a Baltimore police officer. Then, at the officer&#x27;s funeral, they planned to detonate several improvised explosive devices complete with shrapnel. These explosives were intended to kill a large number of police, since many police would attend another officer&#x27;s funeral.

The last phase, Phase Three, was to take place during or shortly after Phase Two, which was to extort several million dollars from the United States government. This money would be used to finance a larger plan, to travel north to Canada. Along the way, they would stop in YMCAs and orphanages recruiting other impressionable young black boys with no parents or guidance. Muhammad thought he could act as their father figure as he did with Malvo.

Once he recruited a large number of young black boys and made his way up to Canada, he would begin their training. Malvo described how John Muhammad intended to train boys in weapons and stealth as he had been taught. Finally, after their training was complete, John Allen Muhammad would send them out across the United States to carry out mass shootings in many other cities, just as he had done in Washington and Baltimore. These attacks would be coordinated and be intended to send the country into chaos that had already been built up after 9/11.

===Civil and regulatory actions===

According to &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; in a story of April 20, 2003, Muhammad had honed his marksmanship at Bull&#x27;s Eye&#x27;s firing range. The newspaper also reported that Malvo told investigators that he shoplifted the 35-inch-long (89 cm) carbine from the &quot;supposedly secure store.&quot;

According to U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) officials, the store and its owners had a long history of firearms sales and records violations and a file 283 pages thick. In July 2003, the ATF revoked the federal firearms license of Brian Borgelt, a former staff sergeant with the U.S. Army Rangers and owner of Bull&#x27;s Eye Shooter Supply. Later that month he transferred ownership of the store to a friend and continued to own the building and operate the adjacent shooting gallery.

On January 16, 2003, the Legal Action Project of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, on behalf of the families of many of the victims of the sniper attacks both in and out of the D.C. area who were killed (including Hong Im Ballenger, &quot;Sonny&quot; Buchanan Jr., Linda Franklin, Conrad Johnson, Sarah Ramos, and James L. Premkumar Walekar) as well as two victims who survived the shooting (Rupinder &quot;Benny&quot; Oberoi and 13-year old Iran Brown) filed a civil lawsuit against Bull&#x27;s Eye Shooter Supply and Bushmaster Firearms, Inc. of Windham, Maine, the gun distributor and manufacturer that made the rifle used in the crime spree, as well as Borgelt, Muhammad, and Malvo. Muhammad, who had a criminal record of domestic battery, and Malvo, a minor, were each legally prohibited from purchasing firearms.

The suit claimed that Bull&#x27;s Eye Shooter Supply ran its gun store in Tacoma, Washington, &quot;in such a grossly negligent manner that scores of its guns routinely &quot;disappeared&quot; from its store and it kept such shoddy records that it could not account for the Bushmaster rifle used in the sniper shootings when asked by federal agents for records of sale for the weapon.&quot; It was alleged that the dealer could not account for hundreds of guns received from manufacturers in the years immediately prior to the Beltway sniper attacks. It was also claimed that Bull&#x27;s Eye continued to sell guns in the same irresponsible manner even after Muhammad and Malvo were caught and found to have acquired the weapon there. Bushmaster was included in the suit because it allegedly continued to sell guns to Bull&#x27;s Eye as a dealer despite an awareness of its record-keeping violations.

The case had been set for trial in April 2005; however, the parties settled before then. Bushmaster said it settled because of escalating legal fees and the dwindling amount of insurance money it had left for the case. Bull&#x27;s Eye contributed $2 million and Bushmaster contributed $500,000 to an out-of-court settlement. Bushmaster also agreed to educate its dealers on safer business practices.

After the settlement was announced, WTOP radio in Washington, D.C., reported that Sonia Wills, mother of victim Conrad Johnson, said her family took part in the lawsuit more to send a message than to collect money. &quot;I think a message was delivered that you should be responsible and accountable for the actions of irresponsible people when you make these guns and put them in their hands,&quot; she said.

There are two national nature reserves in Lancashire, both of which are managed by Natural England, as opposed to some counties where some nature reserves are managed by non-governmental organisations such as the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds or the National Trust.

<text>Josias Simmler (Josiah Simler; ) (6 November 1530 – 2 July 1576) was a Swiss theologian and classicist, author of the first book relating solely to the Alps.

==Life==
The son of the former prior of the Cistercian convent of Kappel (Canton of Zürich), he was born at Kappel, where his father was the Protestant pastor and schoolmaster till his death in 1557. In 1544 Simmler went to Zürich to continue his education under his godfather, the reformer, Heinrich Bullinger. After having completed his studies at Basel and Strasbourg, he returned to Zürich, and became pastor to the neighboring villages.

In 1552 he was made professor of New Testament exegesis at Zürich&#x27;s Carolinum academy, where he also taught mathematics and Ptolemaic astronomy, and in 1560 became professor of theology. In 1555 he published a new edition of Conrad Gessner&#x27;s &quot;Epitome&quot; of his &quot;Bibliotheca universalis&quot; (a list of all authors who had written in Greek, Latin or Hebrew), a new edition of the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; itself, and in 1575 an annotated edition of the &quot;Antonine Itinerary&quot;. Later, he would become deacon to St Peter&#x27;s, Zürich. and translated many of Bullinger&#x27;s works into Latin, and write his biography. In 1559 he had his first attack of gout, a complaint which would eventually kill him.

==Contributions to Swiss studies==
About 1551 he conceived the idea of making his native land better known by translating into Latin parts of the great &quot;Chronik&quot; of Johann Stumpf. With this view he collected materials, and in 1574 published a specimen of his intended work in the shape of a monograph on the Canton of the Valais. He published in the same volume a general description of the Alps, as the Introduction to his projected work on the several Swiss Cantons. In this treatise, entitled &quot;De Alpibus commentarius&quot;, he collected all that the classical authors had written on the Alps, adding a good deal of material collected from his friends and correspondents. This &quot;Commentarius&quot; is the first work exclusively devoted to the Alps, and sums up the knowledge of that region possessed in the 16th century.

It was re-published by the Elzevirs at Leiden in 1633, and again at Zürich in 1735, while an elaborate annotated edition (prepared by Mr Coolidge), with French translation, notes and appendices, appeared at Grenoble in 1904. Another fragment of his vast plan was the work entitled &quot;De Helvetiorum republica&quot;, which appeared at Zürich in 1576, just before his death. It was regarded as the chief authority on Swiss constitutional matters up to 1798. In 1566 he wrote a biography of his friend Conrad Gessner, shortly after his death the previous year.

<doc id="103183" wikidata="Q492380" url="?curid=103183" title="Lauenburg">
<text>Lauenburg (), or Lauenburg an der Elbe (; ), is a town in the state of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is situated on the northern bank of the river Elbe, east of Hamburg. It is overall the southernmost town of Schleswig-Holstein and belongs to the district () of Herzogtum Lauenburg.

==History==
The town was founded in 1182 by Bernard of Ascania, the ancestor of the Dukes of Lauenburg. It took its name from that of the castle of &quot;Lowenborch&quot; (erected here between 1181 and 1182), deriving from &quot;Lave&quot;, the Polabian-language name of the Elbe (compare modern Czech &quot;Labe&quot;).

Saxe-Lauenburg was a duchy until 1 July 1876, when it was incorporated into the Royal Prussian Province of Schleswig-Holstein. Lauenburg served as the ducal capital until 1616, when the castle burnt down. In 1619 the capital was moved to Ratzeburg. The area of the duchy was roughly identical with that of today&#x27;s district. In medieval times Lauenburg was a waypoint on the Old Salt Route, while today it is the southern terminus of the Elbe-Lübeck Canal.

Following the Napoleonic Wars, Lauenburg was ceded by Prussia to Denmark in exchange for the region of Pomerania.

Between 1945 and 1982, Lauenburg served as West German inner German border crossing for cars travelling along Bundesstraße 5 between the Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany (till 1949), thereafter the East German Democratic Republic, or West Berlin and the British zone of occupation (till 1949) and thereafter the West German Federal Republic of Germany. The traffic was subject to the Interzonal traffic regulations that between West Germany and West Berlin followed the special regulations of the Transit Agreement (1972).

==Culture and sights==

Lauenburg has many historic buildings from the 17th century and earlier. These include houses, which were mostly the homes of sailors, and the Maria-Magdalenen Church, which was built in the 13th century.

The town is nestled at the bottom of 50 meter high bluffs. Narrow streets up the hill lead to the &quot;upper town&quot; where Lauenburg Castle is located. Lauenburg Castle, the former residence of the Dukes of Lauenburg and the political centre of their Dukedom, the majority of which has since been destroyed, with only the old castle tower remaining. Currently, the castle serves as city and municipal administration. To the south of the city lies the Elbe and Lower-Saxony, which used to belong to the duchy until it was ceded to the then neighbouring Kingdom of Hanover in 1814. 

Lauenburg also has the &quot;Palmschleuse&quot;, a historic river lock, originally built in 1398 and renewed in the 17th century. It is the oldest of its kind in Europe.

<text>Johann Stumpf (23 April 1500 – c. 1578) was an early writer on the history and topography of Switzerland as well as a theologian and cartographer. 

==Biography==
He was born at Bruchsal (near Karlsruhe), and was educated there and at Strasbourg and Heidelberg. In 1520 he became a cleric or chaplain in the order of the Knights Hospitaller. He was sent in 1521 to the preceptory of that order at Freiburg im Breisgau, ordained a priest at Basel, and in 1522 was placed in charge of the preceptory at Bubikon (north of Rapperswil (SG), in the canton of Zürich). However, Stumpf went over to the Protestants, was present at the Bern Disputation (1528), and took part in the first Kappel War (1529).
In 1529 he married the first of his four wives, a daughter of Heinrich Brennwald, who wrote a work (still in manuscript) on Swiss history, and stimulated his son-in-law to undertake historical studies. Stumpf made wide researches, with this object, for many years, and undertook also several journeys, of which that in 1544 to Engelberg and through the Valais seems to be the most important, perhaps because his original diary has been preserved to us. The fruit of his labours (completed at the end of 1546) was published in 1548 at Zürich in a huge folio of 934 pages (with many fine wood engravings, coats of arms, maps, &amp;c.), under the title of &quot;Gemeiner loblicher Eydgnoschafft Stetten, Landen und Voelckeren Chronick wirdiger thaaten Beschreybung&quot;. An extract from it was published in 1554, under the name of &quot;Schwytzer Chronika&quot;. New and greatly enlarged editions of the original work were issued in 1586 and 1606. 
The woodcuts are best in the first edition, and it remained till Scheuchzer&#x27;s day (early 18th century) the chief authority on its subject.
When he converted to Protestantism, Stumpf had carried over with him most of his parishioners, whom he continued to care for, as the Protestant pastor at Bubikon, till 1543. He then became pastor of Stammheim (today Oberstammheim and Unterstammheim) until 1561, when he retired to Zürich (of which he had been made a burgher in 1548), where he lived in retirement till his death in 1576.

Stumpf also published a monograph (very remarkable for the date) about Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor (1556) and a set of laudatory verses () about each of the thirteen Swiss cantons.

<text>A coin of account is a unit of money that does not exist as an actual coin (that is, a metal disk) but is used in figuring prices or other amounts of money.

==Examples==
===Mill===
The &quot;mill&quot; (or sometimes, &quot;mil&quot;) is a coin of account in the United States. It is equal to one-tenth of a penny, and so to one-thousandth of a dollar (= $0.001), whence the name, which means &quot;thousandth.&quot; There was never such a coin minted by the U.S. Federal government, though some states minted these coins well into the mid-1900s. Coins of account are used in accounting and for figuring taxes, usually either property taxes or sales taxes.

===Guinea===
From 1816 to the 1980s the British Guinea was no longer used a coin but prices for luxury items and professional services were often quoted in guineas, on the understanding that a guinea was equal to 21 shillings.

<text>Johann Jakob Scheuchzer (2 August 1672 – 23 June 1733) was a Swiss physician and natural scientist born in Zürich. His most famous work was the &quot;Physica sacra&quot; in four volumes, which was a commentary on the Bible and included his view of the world, demonstrating a convergence of science and religion. It was richly illustrated with copperplate etchings and came to be called the &quot;Kupfer-Bibel&quot; or &quot;Copper Bible&quot;.

Scheuchzer supported Biblical creation, but his support for Copernican heliocentrism forced him to print his works outside Switzerland. He also supported antecedent concepts of Neptunism and considered fossils as evidence for the Biblical deluge. A fossil from Ohningen that he identified as a human drowned by the Flood was later identified as a Miocene salamander which was named after him as &quot;Andrias scheuchzeri.&quot;

==Life and career==
The son of the namesake senior town physician (&quot;Archiater&quot;) of Zürich and Barbara Fäsi, daughter of the principal of the Latin school, he received his education in Zürich and, in 1692, went to the University of Altdorf near Nuremberg, being intended for the medical profession. Early in 1694, he took his degree of doctor in medicine at the University of Utrecht, and then returned to Altdorf bei Nürnberg to complete his mathematical studies. He studied astronomy under Georg Eimmart. He went back to Zürich in 1696 (following the death of the town physician Johann Jakob Wagner in 1695) and was made junior town physician (&quot;Poliater&quot;) with the promise of the professorship of mathematics which he duly obtained in 1710. From 1697 he was a secretary at the Collegium der Wohlgesinnten where he gave lectures on philosophy. He also worked as a curator of the Kunstkammer (natural history cabinet) of the city of Zürich. He corresponded widely with other scholars and published in the transactions of the Royal Society where he was elected a Fellow on November 30, 1703 seconded by John Woodward (1665–1728) with whom he shared Neptunist-like views. He married Susanna Vogel and they had nearly nine children but only a few lived to adulthood. He was promoted to the chair of physics, with the office of senior city physician (), in January 1733, only a few months before his death. He died on 23 June 1733 in Zürich.

==Published works==
Scheuchzer wrote extensively to &quot;Nova literaria Helvetica&quot;, the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot; and started his own periodicals, &quot;Beschreibung der Natur-Geschichten des Schweizerlands&quot; and &quot;Historischer und politischer Mercurius&quot;. He also published works (apart from numerous articles) were estimated at thirty-four in number. He corresponded extensively across Europe with nearly 800 correspondents. These included the theologian Hortensia von Moos, and his many students such as Antonio Picenino (and his father Giacomo Picenino) with whom he went on alpine excursions. His historical writings are mostly still in manuscript. The more important of his published writings relate either to his scientific observations (all branches) or to his journeys, in the course of which he collected materials for these scientific works.

===Scientific works===

In the former category is his self-published &quot;Beschreibung der Naturgeschichte des Schweitzerlandes&quot; (3 volumes, Zürich, 1706–1708), the third volume containing an account in German of his journey of 1705; a new edition of this book and, with important omissions, of his 1723 work, was issued, in 2 volumes, in 1746, by JG Sulzer, under the title of &quot;Naturgeschichte des Schweitzerlandes sammt seinen Reisen über die schweitzerischen Gebirge&quot;, and his &quot;Helvetiae historia naturalis oder Naturhistorie des Schweitzerlandes&quot; (published in 3 volumes, at Zürich, 1716–1718, and reissued in the same form in 1752, under the German title just given). The first of the three parts of the last-named work deals with the Swiss mountains (summing up all that was then known about them, and serving as a link between Simmler&#x27;s work of 1574 and Gruner&#x27;s of 1760), the second with the Swiss rivers, lakes and mineral baths, and the third with Swiss meteorology and geology.

In his &quot;Physica sacra&quot; he included arguments for the existence of God, suggesting that an atheist should be shown a pin-hole camera and then shown how the eye is a perfect replica of the same, demonstrating intelligent design. He also followed the contemporary tradition of interpreting fossil ammonites as proof of the Biblical deluge. He also described fossil plants in his Herbarium diluvianum (1709). He observed the solar eclipse of 1706 and the lunar eclipse of the same year in which he recorded a Perseid meteor shower.

Scheuchzer&#x27;s works, as issued in 1746 and in 1752, formed (with Tschudi&#x27;s &quot;Chronicum Helveticum&quot;) one of the chief sources for Schiller&#x27;s drama &quot;Wilhelm Tell&quot; (1804). In 1704, Scheuchzer was elected FRS. He published many scientific notes and papers in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; for 1706–07, 1709 and 1727–28.

===Travel works===
In the second category are his &quot;Itinera alpina tria&quot; (made in 1702–04), which was published in London in 1708, and dedicated to the Royal Society, while the plates illustrating it were executed at the expense of various fellows of the society, including the president, Sir Isaac Newton (whose &quot;imprimatur&quot; appears on the title-page), Sir Hans Sloane, Dean Aldrich, Humfrey Wanley, etc. The text is written in Latin, as is that of the definitive work describing his travels (with which is incorporated the 1708 volume) that appeared in 1723 at Leiden, in four quarto volumes, under the title of &quot;Itinera per Helvetiae alpinas regiones facta annis 1702–11.&quot; He also wrote &quot;Helvetiae stoicheiographia&quot; (1716–1718) based on his annual alpine travels.

These journeys led Scheuchzer to almost every part of Switzerland, particularly its central and eastern districts. Apropos of his visit (1705) to the Rhône Glacier, he inserts a full account of the other Swiss glaciers, as far as they were then known, while in 1706, after mentioning certain wonders to be seen in the museum at Lucerne, he adds reports by men of good faith who had seen dragons in Switzerland. He doubts their existence, but illustrates the reports by fanciful representations of dragons, which have led some modern writers to depreciate his merits as a traveller and naturalist, for the belief in dragons was then widely spread.

In 1712 he published a map of Switzerland in four sheets (scale 1/290,000), of which the east portion (based on his personal observations) is by far the most accurate, though the map as a whole was the best map of Switzerland until the end of the 18th century. At the end of his 1723 book he gives a full list (covering 27 quarto pages) of his writings from 1694 to 1721.

Scheuchzer is also known for his paleontological work. He discovered and donated to museums the fossilized fishes from the slates of the Matt Formation in Glarus, which were among the earliest fossil fishes in Europe to be scientifically documented. These fossil fishes became the target of a thriving fossil trade shortly after his publicization of them. In his &quot;Lithographia Helvetica&quot;, he described fossils as &quot;plays of nature&quot; or alternately as leftovers from the biblical Flood. Most famously, he claimed that a fossilized skeleton found in a Baden quarry was the remains of a human who had perished in the deluge. This claim, which seemed to verify the claims of Christian scripture, was accepted for several decades after Scheuchzer&#x27;s death, until 1811, when French naturalist Georges Cuvier re-examined the specimen and showed that it was actually a large prehistoric salamander which was named in his memory as &quot;Andrias scheuchzeri&quot;.

==Honours and awards==
In November 1703, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Scheuchzerhorn (3462 m) and Scheuchzerjoch in the Bernese Alps are named after Johann Jakob Scheuchzer. Scheuchzeriaceae and Scheuchzeria palustris are named in his honour.

<doc id="103190" wikidata="Q208304" url="?curid=103190" title="Wren">
<text>Wrens are a family, Troglodytidae, of small brown passerine birds. The family includes 96 species and is divided into 19 genera. All species are restricted to the New World except for the Eurasian wren that is widely distributed in the Old World. In Anglophone regions, the Eurasian wren is commonly known simply as the &quot;wren&quot;, as it is the originator of the name. The name &quot;wren&quot; has been applied to other, unrelated birds, particularly the New Zealand wrens (Acanthisittidae) and the Australian wrens (Maluridae).

Most wrens are visually inconspicuous though they have loud and often complex songs. Exceptions include the relatively large members of the genus &quot;Campylorhynchus&quot;, which can be quite bold in their behaviour. Wrens have short wings that are barred in most species, and they often hold their tails upright. Wrens are primarily insectivorous, eating insects, spiders and other small invertebrates, but many species also eat vegetable matter and some eat small frogs and lizards.

==Etymology and usage==
The English name &quot;wren&quot; derives from and , attested (as ) very early, in an eighth-century gloss. It is cognate to , , and (the latter two including an additional diminutive &quot;-ilan&quot; suffix). The Icelandic name is attested in Old Icelandic (Eddaic) as . This points to a Common Germanic name , but the further etymology of the name is unknown.

The wren was also known as the (&#x27;kinglet&#x27;) in Old High German, a name associated with the fable of the election of the &quot;king of birds&quot;. The bird that could fly to the highest altitude would be made king. The eagle outflew all other birds, but he was beaten by a small bird that had hidden in his plumage. This fable was already known to Aristotle (&quot;Historia Animalium&quot; 9.11) and Pliny (&quot;Natural History&quot; 10.95), and was taken up by medieval authors such as Johann Geiler von Kaisersberg, but it most likely originally concerned kinglets (, such as the goldcrest) and was apparently motivated by the yellow &quot;crown&quot; sported by these birds (a point noted already by Ludwig Uhland). The confusion stemmed in part from the similarity and consequent interchangeability of the Ancient Greek words for the wren ( , &#x27;king&#x27;) and the crest ( , &#x27;kinglet&#x27;), and the legend&#x27;s reference to the &quot;smallest of birds&quot; becoming king likely led the title to be transferred to the equally tiny wren. In modern German, the name of the bird is (&#x27;king of the fence (or hedge)&#x27;) and in Dutch, the name is (&#x27;king of winter&#x27;).

The family name Troglodytidae is derived from troglodyte, which means &#x27;cave-dweller&#x27;. Wrens get their scientific name from the tendency of some species to forage in dark crevices.

The name &quot;wren&quot; is also ascribed to other families of passerine birds throughout the world. In Europe, kinglets are commonly known as &quot;wrens&quot;, with the common firecrest and goldcrest known as the &quot;fire-crested wren&quot; and &quot;golden-crested wren&quot;, respectively.

The 27 Australasian &quot;wren&quot; species in the family Maluridae are unrelated, as are the New Zealand wrens in the family Acanthisittidae, the antbirds in the family Thamnophilidae, and the Old World babblers of the family Timaliidae.

==Description==
Wrens are medium-small to very small birds. The Eurasian wren is among the smallest birds in its range, while the smaller species from the Americas are among the smallest passerines in that part of the world. They range in size from the white-bellied wren, which averages under and , to the giant wren, which averages about and weighs almost . The dominating colors of their plumage are generally drab, composed of gray, brown, black, and white, and most species show some barring, especially on the tail or wings. No sexual dimorphism is seen in the plumage of wrens, and little difference exists between young birds and adults. All have fairly long, straight to marginally decurved (downward-curving) bills.

Wrens have loud and often complex songs, sometimes given in duet by a pair. The songs of members of the genera &quot;Cyphorhinus&quot; and &quot;Microcerculus&quot; have been considered especially pleasant to the human ear, leading to common names such as song wren, musician wren, flutist wren, and southern nightingale-wren.

==Distribution and habitat==
Wrens are principally a New World family, distributed from Alaska and Canada to southern Argentina, with the greatest species richness in the Neotropics. As suggested by its name, the Eurasian wren is the only species of wren found outside the Americas, as restricted to Europe, Asia, and northern Africa (it was formerly considered conspecific with the winter wren and Pacific wren of North America). The insular species include the Clarión wren and Socorro wren from the Revillagigedo Islands in the Pacific Ocean, and Cobb&#x27;s wren in the Falkland Islands, but few Caribbean islands have a species of wren, with only the southern house wren in the Lesser Antilles, the Cozumel wren of Cozumel Island, and the highly restricted Zapata wren in a single swamp in Cuba.

The various species occur in a wide range of habitats, ranging from dry, sparsely wooded country to rainforests. Most species are mainly found at low levels, but members of the genus &quot;Campylorhynchus&quot; are frequently found higher, and the two members of &quot;Odontorchilus&quot; are restricted to the forest canopy. A few species, notably the Eurasian wren and the house wren, are often associated with humans. Most species are resident, remaining in Central and South America all year round, but the few species found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere are partially migratory, spending the winter further south.

==Behavior and ecology==

Wrens vary from highly secretive species such as those found in the genus &quot;Microcerculus&quot; to the highly conspicuous genus &quot;Campylorhynchus&quot;, the members of which frequently sing from exposed perches. The family as a whole exhibits a great deal of variation in their behavior. Temperate species generally occur in pairs, but some tropical species may occur in parties of up to 20 birds.

Wrens build dome-shaped nests, and may be either monogamous or polygamous, depending on species.

Though little is known about the feeding habits of many of the Neotropical species, wrens are considered primarily insectivorous, eating insects, spiders, and other small arthropods. Many species also take vegetable matter such as seeds and berries, and some (primarily the larger species) take small frogs and lizards. The Eurasian wren has been recorded wading into shallow water to catch small fish and tadpoles; Sumichrast&#x27;s wren and the Zapata wren take snails; and the giant wren and marsh wren have been recorded attacking and eating bird eggs (in the latter species, even eggs of conspecifics). A local Spanish name for the giant wren and bicolored wren is (&#x27;egg-sucker&#x27;), but whether the latter actually eats eggs is unclear. The plain wren and northern house wren sometimes destroy bird eggs, and the rufous-and-white wren has been recorded killing nestlings, but this is apparently to eliminate potential food competitors rather than to feed on the eggs or nestlings. Several species of Neotropical wrens sometimes participate in mixed-species flocks or follow army ants, and the Eurasian wren may follow badgers to catch prey items disturbed by them.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

Revised following Martínez Gómez et al. (2005) and Mann et al. (2006), the taxonomy of some groups is highly complex, and future species-level splits are likely. Additionally, undescribed taxa are known to exist. The black-capped donacobius is an enigmatic species traditionally placed with the wrens more for lack of a more apparent alternative than as a result of thorough study. It was recently determined to be most likely closer to certain warblers, possibly the newly established Megaluridae, and might constitute a monotypic family.

The genus level cladogram of the Troglodytidae shown below is based on a molecular phylogenetic study by Tyler Imfeld and collaborators that was published in 2024. The number of species in each genus is based on the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela C. Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).

==Relationship with humans==
The wren features prominently in culture. The Eurasian wren has been long considered &quot;the king of birds&quot; in Europe. Killing one or harassing its nest is associated with bad luck, such as broken bones, lightning strikes on homes, or injury to cattle. Wren Day, celebrated in parts of Ireland on St. Stephen&#x27;s Day (26 December), features a fake wren being paraded around town on a decorative pole; up to the 20th century, real birds were hunted for this purpose. A possible origin for the tradition is revenge for the betrayal of Saint Stephen by a noisy wren when he was trying to hide from enemies in a bush.

The Carolina wren (&quot;Thryothorus ludovicianus&quot;) has been the state bird of South Carolina since 1948, and features on the back of its state quarter. The British farthing featured a wren on the reverse side from 1937 until its demonetisation in 1960. The Cactus wren (&quot;Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus&quot;) was designated the state bird of Arizona in 1931.

The Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service (WRNS) were nicknamed Wrens based on the acronym WRNS. After the Women&#x27;s Royal Navy Service was integrated into the Royal Navy in 1993, the title of Wren was dropped from official usage, however unofficially female sailors are still referred to as Wrens.

== History ==

===American private shortwave broadcasting before World War II===
Before World War II, all American shortwave radio stations were in private hands. Privately controlled shortwave networks included the National Broadcasting Company&#x27;s International Network (or White Network), which broadcast in six languages, the Columbia Broadcasting System&#x27;s Latin American international network, which consisted of 64 stations located in 18 countries, the Crosley Broadcasting Corporation in Cincinnati, Ohio, and General Electric which owned and operated WGEO and WGEA, both based in Schenectady, New York, and KGEI in San Francisco, all of which had shortwave transmitters. Experimental programming began in the 1930s, but there were fewer than 12 transmitters in operation.

In 1939, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission set the following policy, which was intended to enforce the US State Department&#x27;s Good Neighbor Policy, but which some broadcasters felt was an attempt to direct censorship:

A licensee of an international broadcast station shall render only an international broadcast service which will reflect the culture of this country and which will promote international goodwill, understanding and cooperation. Any program solely intended for, and directed to an audience in the continental United States does not meet the requirements for this service.

Around 1940, shortwave signals to Latin America were regarded as vital to counter Nazi propaganda. Initially, the US Office of the Coordinator of Information sent releases to each station, but this was seen as an inefficient means of transmitting news. The director of Latin American relations at the Columbia Broadcasting System was Edmund A. Chester, and he supervised the development of CBS&#x27;s extensive &quot;La Cadena de las Américas&quot; radio network to improve broadcasting to South America during the 1940s.

===World War II===

Even before the December 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government&#x27;s Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI) had already begun providing war news and commentary to the commercial American shortwave radio stations for use on a voluntary basis, through its Foreign Information Service (FIS) headed by playwright Robert E. Sherwood, who served as President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s speech writer and information advisor. Direct programming began a week after the United States&#x27; entry into World War II in December 1941, with the first broadcast from the San Francisco office of the FIS via General Electric&#x27;s KGEI transmitting to the Philippines in English (other languages followed). The next step was to broadcast to Germany, which was called &quot;Stimmen aus Amerika&quot; (&quot;Voices from America&quot;) and was transmitted on February 1, 1942. It was introduced by the “Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; and included the pledge: &quot;Today, and every day from now on, we will be with you from America to talk about the war... The news may be good or bad for us – We will always tell you the truth.&quot; Roosevelt approved this broadcast, which then-Colonel William J. Donovan (COI) and Sherwood (FIS) had recommended to him. It was Sherwood who actually coined the term &quot;The Voice of America&quot; to describe the shortwave network that began its transmissions on February 1, from 270 Madison Avenue in New York City.

The Office of War Information, when organized in the middle of 1942, officially took over VOA&#x27;s operations. VOA reached an agreement with the British Broadcasting Corporation to share medium-wave transmitters in Great Britain, and expanded into Tunis in North Africa and Palermo and Bari, Italy, as the Allies captured these territories. The OWI also set up the American Broadcasting Station in Europe. Asian transmissions started with one transmitter in California in 1941; services were expanded by adding transmitters in Hawaii and, after recapture, the Philippines.

By the end of the war, VOA had 39 transmitters and provided service in 40 languages. Programming was broadcast from production centers in New York and San Francisco, with more than 1,000 programs originating from New York. Programming consisted of music, news, commentary, and relays of U.S. domestic programming, in addition to specialized VOA programming. About half of VOA&#x27;s services, including the Arabic service, were discontinued in 1945. In late 1945, VOA was transferred to the US Department of State.

Also included among the cultural diplomacy programming on the Columbia Broadcasting System was the musical show &quot;Viva America&quot; (1942–49) which featured the Pan American Orchestra and the artistry of several noted musicians from both North and South America, including Alfredo Antonini, Juan Arvizu, Eva Garza, Elsa Miranda, Nestor Mesta Chaires, Miguel Sandoval, John Serry Sr., and Terig Tucci. By 1945, broadcasts of the show were carried by 114 stations on CBS&#x27;s &quot;La Cadena de las Américas&quot; network in 20 Latin American nations. These broadcasts proved to be highly successful in supporting President Roosevelt&#x27;s policy of Pan-Americanism throughout South America during World War II.

===Cold War===
The VOA ramped up its operations during the Cold War. Foy Kohler, the director of VOA from 1949 to 1952, strongly believed that the VOA was serving its purpose, which he identified as aiding in the fight against communism. He argued that the numbers of listeners they were getting such as 194,000 regular listeners in Sweden, and 2.1 million regular listeners in France, was an indication of a positive impact. As further evidence, he noted that the VOA received 30,000 letters a month from listeners all over the world, and hundreds of thousands of requests for broadcasting schedules. There was an analysis done of some of those letters sent in 1952 and 1953 while Kohler was still director. The study found that letter writing could be an indicator of successful, actionable persuasion. It was also found that broadcasts in different countries were having different effects. In one country, regular listeners adopted and practiced American values presented by the broadcast. Age was also a factor: younger and older audiences tended to like different types of programs, no matter the country. Kohler used all of this as evidence to claim that the VOA helped to grow and strengthen the free world. It also influenced the UN in their decision to condemn communist actions in Korea, and was a major factor in the decline of communism in the &quot;free world, including key countries such as Italy and France. In Italy, the VOA did not just bring an end to communism, but it caused the country to Americanize. The VOA also had an impact behind the Iron Curtain. Practically all defectors during Kohler&#x27;s time said that the VOA helped in their decision to defect. Another indication of impact, according to Kohler, was the Soviet response. Kohler argued that the Soviets responded because the VOA was having an impact. Based on Soviet responses, it can be presumed that the most effective programs were ones that compared the lives of those behind and outside the Iron Curtain, questions on the practice of slave labor, as well as lies and errors in Stalin&#x27;s version of Marxism.

In 1947, VOA started broadcasting to the Soviet citizens in Russia under the pretext of countering &quot;more harmful instances of Soviet propaganda directed against American leaders and policies&quot; on the part of the internal Soviet Russian-language media, according to John B. Whitton&#x27;s treatise, &quot;Cold War Propaganda&quot;. The Soviet Union responded by initiating electronic jamming of VOA broadcasts on April 24, 1949.

Charles W. Thayer headed VOA in 1948–49. Over the next few years, the U.S. government debated the best role of Voice of America. The decision was made to use VOA broadcasts as a part of U.S. foreign policy to fight the propaganda of the Soviet Union and other countries. The Arabic service resumed on January 1, 1950, with a half-hour program. This program grew to 14.5 hours daily during the Suez Crisis of 1956, and was six hours a day by 1958. Between 1952 and 1960, Voice of America used a converted U.S. Coast Guard cutter &quot;Courier&quot; as a first mobile broadcasting ship.
Control of VOA passed from the State Department to the U.S. Information Agency when the latter was established in 1953 to transmit worldwide, including to the countries behind the Iron Curtain and to the People&#x27;s Republic of China. From 1955 until 2003, VOA broadcast American jazz on the &quot;Voice of America Jazz Hour&quot;. Hosted for most of that period by Willis Conover, the program had 30 million listeners at its peak. A program aimed at South Africa in 1956 broadcast two hours nightly, and special programs such as &quot;The Newport Jazz Festival&quot; were also transmitted. This was done in association with tours by U.S. musicians, such as Dizzy Gillespie, Louis Armstrong, and Duke Ellington, sponsored by the State Department. From August 1952 through May 1953, Billy Brown, a high school senior in Westchester County, New York, had a Monday night program in which he shared everyday happenings in Yorktown Heights, New York. Brown&#x27;s program ended due to its popularity: his &quot;chatty narratives&quot; attracted so much fan mail, VOA couldn&#x27;t afford the $500 a month in clerical and postage costs required to respond to listeners&#x27; letters. During 1953, VOA personnel were subjected to McCarthyist policies, where VOA was accused by Senator Joseph McCarthy, Roy Cohn, and Gerard David Schine of intentionally planning to build weak transmitting stations to sabotage VOA broadcasts. However, the charges were dropped after one month of court hearings in February and March 1953.

Sometime around 1954, VOA&#x27;s headquarters were moved from New York to Washington D.C. The arrival of cheap, low-cost transistors enabled the significant growth of shortwave radio listeners. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, VOA&#x27;s broadcasts were deemed controversial, as Hungarian refugees and revolutionaries thought that VOA served as a medium and insinuated the possible arrival of the Western aid.

Throughout the Cold War, many of the targeted countries&#x27; governments sponsored jamming of VOA broadcasts, which sometimes led critics to question the broadcasts&#x27; actual impact. For example, in 1956, Polish People&#x27;s Republic stopped jamming VOA transmissions, but People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria continued to jam the signal through the 1970s. In 1966 Edward R. Murrow said that: &quot;The Russians spend more money jamming the Voice of America than we have to spend for the entire program of the entire Agency. They spend about $125 million 
($ in current dollar terms) a year jamming it.&quot; Chinese-language VOA broadcasts were jammed beginning in 1956 and extending through 1976. However, after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, interviews with participants in anti-Soviet movements verified the effectiveness of VOA broadcasts in transmitting information to socialist societies. The People&#x27;s Republic of China diligently jams VOA broadcasts. Cuba has also been reported to interfere with VOA satellite transmissions to Iran from its Russian-built transmission site at Bejucal. David Jackson, former director of Voice of America, noted: &quot;The North Korean government doesn&#x27;t jam us, but they try to keep people from listening through intimidation or worse. But people figure out ways to listen despite the odds. They&#x27;re very resourceful.&quot;


Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, VOA covered some of the era&#x27;s most important news, including Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s 1963 &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, the Assassination of John F. Kennedy, and Neil Armstrong&#x27;s 1969 first walk on the Moon, which drew an audience estimated at between 615 and 750 million people. In 1973, due to the détente policies in the Cold War, Soviet jamming of the VOA ceased; it restarted in 1979.In the early 1980s, VOA began a $1.3 billion rebuilding program to improve broadcast with better technical capabilities. During the implementation of the Martial law in Poland between 1981 and 1983, VOA&#x27;s Polish broadcasts expanded to seven hours daily. Throughout the 1980s, VOA focused on covering events from the &#x27;American hinterland&#x27;, such as 150th anniversary of the Oregon Trail. Also in the 1980s, VOA also added a television service, as well as special regional programs to Cuba, Radio Martí and TV Martí. Cuba has consistently attempted to jam such broadcasts and has vociferously protested U.S. broadcasts directed at Cuba. In September 1980, VOA started broadcasting to Afghanistan in Dari and in Pashto in 1982. In 1981, VOA opened a bureau in Beijing, China. The next year, it began regular exchanges with Radio Peking.

In 1985, VOA Europe was created as a special service in English that was relayed via satellite to AM, FM, and cable affiliates throughout Europe. With a contemporary format including live disc jockeys, the network presented top musical hits as well as VOA news and features of local interest (such as &quot;EuroFax&quot;) 24 hours a day. VOA Europe was closed down without advance public notice in January 1997 as a cost-cutting measure. It was followed by VOA Express, which from July 4, 1999, revamped into VOA Music Mix. Since November 1, 2014, stations are offered VOA1 (which is a rebranding of VOA Music Mix).

In 1989, Voice of America expanded its Mandarin and Cantonese programming to reach the millions of Chinese and inform the country about the pro-democracy movement within the country, including the demonstration in Tiananmen Square. Starting in 1990, the U.S. consolidated its international broadcasting efforts, with the establishment of the Bureau of Broadcasting.

===Post–Cold War===
With the breakup of the Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe, VOA added many additional language services to reach those areas. This decade was marked by the additions of services in Standard Tibetan, Kurdish (to Iran and Iraq), Serbo-Croatian (Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian), Macedonian, and Rwanda-Rundi.

In 1993, the Clinton administration advised cutting funding for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, as it believed post-Cold War information and influence was not needed in Europe. This plan was not well received, and US President Bill Clinton then proposed the compromise of the International Broadcasting Act, which he signed into law in 1994. This law established the International Broadcasting Bureau as a part of the United States Information Agency (USIA), and established the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) with oversight authority, which took control from the Board for International Broadcasters which previously had overseen funding for RFE/RL. In 1998, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act was signed into law, and mandated that the BBG become an independent federal agency as of October 1, 1999. This act also abolished the USIA, and merged most of its functions into those of the State Department.

In 1994, Voice of America became the first broadcast-news organization to offer continuously updated programs on the Internet.

=== Cuts and expansion ===
The Arabic Service was abolished in 2002 and replaced by a new radio service, called the Middle East Radio Network or Radio Sawa, with an initial budget of $22 million. Radio Sawa offered mostly Western and Middle Eastern popular songs with periodic brief news bulletins.

The Arabic Service expanded to television with Alhurra on February 14, 2004 (and later to various social media and websites). On May 16, 2004, the US government&#x27;s international English language TV service Worldnet, became part of VOA as &quot;VOA TV&quot;.

Radio programs in Russian ended in July 2008. In September 2008, VOA eliminated the Hindi-language service after 53 years. Broadcasts in Ukrainian, Serbian, Macedonian, and Bosnian also ended. These reductions were part of American efforts to concentrate more resources to broadcast to the Muslim world. In September 2010, VOA began radio broadcasts in Sudan. As U.S. interests in South Sudan grew, there was a desire to provide people with free information.

In 2013, VOA ended foreign-language transmissions on shortwave and medium wave to Albania, Georgia, Iran, and Latin America, as well as English-language broadcasts to the Middle East and Afghanistan. This was done due to budget cuts. On July 1, 2014, VOA cut most of its English-language transmissions to Asia, as well as shortwave transmissions in Azerbaijani, Bengali, Khmer, Kurdish, Lao, and Uzbek. The following month, the Greek service ended after 72 years on air.

===Russia===
RFE/RL launched the Russian language Current Time TV, in October 2014.

In January 2016, upon his arrival in Moscow, Russian authorities detained and then deported Jeff Shell, the Chairman of the Broadcasting Board of Governors that oversees the Voice of America, despite his having a valid Russian visa. Russian authorities did not explain their actions.

Round-the-clock broadcasting of Current Time began on February 7, 2017.

In December 2017, under a new directive from Russia&#x27;s Kremlin after a new law was passed by the State Duma (Russia&#x27;s lower house of parliament) and the upper house Federation Council and signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, Voice of America was deemed a &quot;foreign agent&quot; under the Russian foreign agent law. In June 2021, the Russian news agency TASS reported that Russia&#x27;s state communications watchdog &quot;Roskomnadzor&quot; complained that the foreign agent Voice of America radio station challengingly refused to observe Russian law because it had not established a Russian legal entity. &quot;Roskomnadzor&quot; also said that VOA was as a foreign agent &quot;obliged to mark their content and provide information about all aspects of their activity, including a detailed description of contacts with the authorities.&quot;

In March 2022, VOA and other news broadcasters, including the BBC, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and Deutsche Welle were blocked in Russia, as after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russian authorities increased censorship of independent journalism, anti-war protests, and dissenting voices. Nevertheless, many Russians have used VPNs and other software to get around Russian government blocks. As of March 2022, VOA broadcasts were reaching people in Russia and the region through TV, FM and medium wave radio, digital, and direct-to-home satellite. In May 2023, Russia banned then-acting VOA chief Yolanda Lopez from ever entering the country.

The current director, Michael Abramowitz, assumed the position in July 2024. He previously served as president of Freedom House and spent nearly 25 years as a reporter and editor for The Washington Post.

In December 2024, president-elect Trump announced he would name former news anchor Kari Lake to be the director of VOA. Under the International Broadcasting Act only the International Broadcasting Advisory Board has the authority to approve the appointment or removal of the VOA Director.

==Agencies==
Voice of America has been a part of several agencies. From its founding in 1942 to 1945, it was part of the Office of War Information, and then from 1945 to 1953 as a function of the State Department. VOA was placed under the U.S. Information Agency in 1953. When the USIA was abolished in 1999, VOA was placed under the BBG which is an autonomous U.S. government agency, with bipartisan membership. The Secretary of State has a seat on the BBG. The BBG was established as a buffer to protect VOA and other U.S.-sponsored, non-military, international broadcasters from political interference. It replaced the Board for International Broadcasting (BIB) that oversaw the funding and operation of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a branch of VOA.

== 52 Documentary ==
In 2021, Voice of America launched 52 Documentary, a series that publishes weekly films about human experiences. The series is presented on the streaming app, VOA+, and YouTube. Films average 10–15 minutes and are translated with captions in several languages, including Russian, Persian, Mandarin, Urdu, and English. Euna Lee directs the program.

==Smith–Mundt Act==
From 1948 until its amendment in 2013, Voice of America was forbidden to broadcast directly to American citizens, pursuant to § 501 of the Smith–Mundt Act. The intent of the 1948 legislation was to protect the American public from propaganda by its own government and to avoid any competition with private American companies. The act was amended via the passage of the &quot;Smith-Mundt Modernization Act&quot; provision of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2013. The amendment was intended to adapt the law to the Internet and to allow American citizens access to VOA content.

==Policies==

===VOA charter===
Under the Eisenhower administration in 1959, VOA Director Henry Loomis commissioned a formal statement of principles to protect the integrity of VOA programming and define the organization&#x27;s mission, and was issued by Director George V. Allen as a directive in 1960 and was endorsed in 1962 by USIA director Edward R. Murrow. VOA&#x27;s charter was signed into law by President Gerald Ford.

VOA&#x27;s charter requires it to &quot;present the policies of the United States clearly and effectively.&quot; Academics including Téwodros W. Workneh have described this as a public diplomacy function. VOA&#x27;s charter also requires it to be &quot;a reliable and authoritative source of news&quot; which &quot;shall be accurate, objective, and comprehensive&quot;.

===&quot;Firewall&quot;===
The Voice of America Firewall was put in place with the 1976 VOA Charter and laws passed in 1994 and 2016 as a way of ensuring the integrity of VOA&#x27;s journalism. This policy fights against propaganda and promotes unbiased and objective journalistic standards in the agency. The charter is one part of this firewall and the other laws assist in ensuring high standards of journalism.

===&quot;Two-source rule&quot;===
According to former VOA correspondent Alan Heil, the internal policy of VOA News is that any story broadcast must have two independently corroborating sources or have a staff correspondent witness an event.

==&quot;VOA Radiogram&quot;==

&quot;VOA Radiogram&quot; was an experimental Voice of America program that started in March 2013 and ended in June 2017, which transmitted digital text and images via shortwave radiograms. There were 220 editions of the program, transmitted each weekend from the Edward R. Murrow transmitting station. The audio tones that comprised the bulk of each 30-minute program were transmitted via an analog transmitter, and could be decoded using a basic AM shortwave receiver with freely downloadable software of the Fldigi family. This software was available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD systems. Broadcasts could also be decoded using the free TIVAR app from the Google Play store using any Android device. The mode used most often on &quot;VOA Radiogram&quot;, for both text and images, was MFSK32, but other modes were also occasionally transmitted. The final edition of &quot;VOA Radiogram&quot; was transmitted during the weekend of June 17–18, 2017, a week before the retirement of the program producer from VOA. An offer to continue the broadcasts on a contract basis was declined, so a follow-on show called &quot;Shortwave Radiogram&quot; began transmission on June 25, 2017, from the WRMI transmitting site in Okeechobee, Florida.

;&quot;Shortwave Radiogram&quot; program schedule
==Transmission facilities==

The Bethany Relay Station, operational from 1944 to 1994, was based on a site in Union Township (now West Chester Township) in Butler County, Ohio, near Cincinnati. Major transmitter upgrades first were undertaken around 1963, when shortwave and medium-wave transmitters were built, upgraded, or rebuilt. The site is now a recreational park with a Voice of America museum. Other former sites include California (Dixon and Delano), Hawaii, Okinawa, Liberia (Monrovia), Costa Rica, Belize, and at least two in Greece (Kavala and Rhodos).

Between 1983 and 1990, VOA made significant upgrades to transmission facilities in Botswana (Selebi-Phikwe), Morocco, Thailand (Udon Thani), Kuwait, and São Tomé (Almas). Some of them are shared with Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia.

VOA and USAGM continue to operate shortwave radio transmitters and antenna farms at International Broadcasting Bureau Greenville Transmitting Station (known as &quot;Site B&quot;) in the United States, close to Greenville, North Carolina. They do not use FCC-issued call signs, since the FCC does not regulate communications by other federal government agencies. The International Broadcasting Bureau also operates transmission facilities on São Tomé and Tinang, Concepcion, Tarlac, Philippines for VOA.

==Controversies==
=== Mismanagement and Abuse of Power ===
On June 12, 2024, the House Foreign Affairs Committee concluded that there was &quot;credible evidence of corruption&quot; regarding the matter of Setareh Derakhshesh Sieg, the former director of Voice of America&#x27;s Persian News Network (PNN). Following a series of whistleblower complaints and an extensive internal investigation by civil servants, Sieg had been terminated in January 2021 for falsifying her education credentials, severe abuses of taxpayer dollars for personal benefit, and engaging in a pattern of favoritism that materially benefited some employees and contractors at the expense of the public. Lopez abruptly resigned in September 2023 as the Committee intensified its investigation. In its June 2024 report, the Committee found that the original allegations had merit and were supported by substantial evidence. Sieg remains employed at VOA.

===Abdul Malik Rigi interview===
On April 2, 2007, Abdul Malik Rigi, the leader of Jundullah, an Iranian Muslim Sunni Salafi militant group with possible links to al-Qaeda, appeared on Voice of America&#x27;s Persian-language service. The interview was condemned by the Iranian government. Jundullah was linked to attacks on both Iranian military and civilians. Rigi was captured by the Iranian security services and executed in 2010 in Evin Prison in Tehran.

===Tibetan alleged protester ===
In February 2013, a documentary released by China Central Television interviewed a Tibetan alleged self-immolator who failed to kill himself. The interviewee said he was motivated by Voice of America&#x27;s broadcasts of commemorations of people who committed suicide in political self-immolation. VOA denied instigating self-immolations and demanded that the Chinese station retract its report.

===Trump presidency politicization efforts===
====First Administration (2017-2021)====
After the January 2017 inauguration of US President Donald Trump, tweets by Voice of America (one of which was later removed) seemed to support the widely criticized statements by White House press secretary Sean Spicer about the crowd size and biased media coverage. This raised concerns over possible attempts by Trump to politicize VOA.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon/01/24/2017&quot;&gt;Donald Trump sends two aides to Voice of America studios, raising fears he&#x27;s going to politicize the outlet , &quot;Salon&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This amplified already growing propaganda concerns over the provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, signed into law by Barack Obama, which gave the powers of the board of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which was relegated to an advisory role, to a CEO appointed by the president. Trump sent two of his political aides to the agency to aid its CEO during the transition to the Trump administration. Criticism was raised over Trump&#x27;s choice of aides; Matthew Schuck was a staff writer for right-wing website &quot;The Daily Surge&quot; until 2015, while Matthew Ciepielowski was a field director at the conservative libertarian advocacy group Americans for Prosperity. VOA officials responded with assurances that they would not become &quot;Trump TV&quot;. BBG head John F. Lansing told NPR that it would be illegal for the administration to tell VOA what to broadcast, while VOA director Amanda Bennett stressed that while &quot;government-funded&quot;, the agency is not &quot;government-run&quot;.

On April 10, 2020, the White House published an article in its daily newsletter critical of VOA coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Emails revealed in a Freedom of Information Act request showed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) press official Michawn Rich had sent a memo to agency employees stating in part, &quot;as a rule, do not send up [interview] requests for [VOA contributor] Greta Van Susteren or anyone affiliated with Voice of America&quot;, referencing the White House story. On April 30, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, referring to Steven L. Herman who covered the White House for VOA, reported Vice President Mike Pence&#x27;s office &quot;threatened to retaliate against a reporter who revealed that Pence&#x27;s office had told journalists they would need masks for Pence&#x27;s visit to the Mayo Clinic – a requirement Pence himself did not follow.&quot;

On June 3, 2020, the US Senate confirmed Michael Pack, a conservative documentaries filmmaker and close ally of Steve Bannon, to serve as head of the US Agency for Global Media, which oversees VOA. Subsequently, Director Bennet and deputy director Sandy Sugawara resigned from VOA. CNN reported on June 16 that plans for a leadership shakeup at VOA were being discussed, including the possibility that controversial former White House aide Sebastian Gorka would be given a leadership role at VOA. On June 17, the heads of VOA&#x27;s Middle East Broadcasting, Radio Free Asia, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and the Open Technology Fund were all fired, their boards were dissolved, and external communications from VOA employees were made to require approval from senior agency personnel in what one source described as an &quot;unprecedented&quot; move, while Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, like Pack a Bannon ally, was rumored to be in line to head the Office of Cuba Broadcasting. Four former members of the advisory boards filed suit challenging Pack&#x27;s standing to fire them. On July 9, NPR reported VOA would not renew the work visas of dozens of non-resident reporters, many of whom could face repercussions in their home countries. In late July, four contractors and the head of VOA&#x27;s Urdu-language service were suspended after a video featuring extensive clips from a Muslim-American voter conference, including a campaign message from then-Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, was determined not to meet editorial standards and taken down.

On August 12, 2020, USAGM chief financial officer Grant Turner and general counsel David Kligerman were removed from their positions and stripped of their security clearances, reportedly for their opposition to what Turner called &quot;gross mismanagement&quot;, along with four other senior agency officials. &quot;Politico&quot; reported on August 13 that Trump administration official and former shock jock Frank Wuco had been hired as a USAGM senior advisor, responsible for auditing the agency&#x27;s office of policy and research. As a radio host, Wuco issued insults and groundless claims against former US President Barack Obama, CIA Director John O. Brennan, and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. VOA&#x27;s Twitter account during this period featured stories favorable to Vice President Mike Pence and White House advisor Ivanka Trump.

In response to Pack&#x27;s August 27 interview with &quot;The Federalist&quot; website, a group of VOA journalists sent a letter to VOA Acting Director Elez Biberaj complaining that Pack&#x27;s &quot;comments and decisions &#x27;endanger the personal security of VOA reporters at home and abroad, as well as threatening to harm U.S. national security objectives.&#x27;&quot; VOA&#x27;s response was that &quot;it would not respond directly to the letter because it was &#x27;improper&#x27; and &#x27;failed to follow procedure.&#x27; Instead, the leadership of USAGM and VOA &#x27;are handling the choice of complaint transmission as an administrative issue,&#x27; which suggested that the journalists could face sanctions for their letter,&quot; according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. In the same story, the &quot;Post&quot; reported that VOA Spanish-language service White House correspondent&#x27;s Brigo Segovia&#x27;s interview with an official about the administration&#x27;s response to Pack&#x27;s personnel and other moves had been censored and his own access to VOA&#x27;s computer system restricted.

On July 20, 2020, District of Columbia attorney general Karl A. Racine filed suit under the District&#x27;s Nonprofit Corporations Act to reverse Pack&#x27;s replacement of the Open Technology Fund (OTF) board. Beginning in August 2020, OTF came under increasing pressure from Peck and USAGM leadership. According to Axios, this was related to OTF&#x27;s reluctance to extend grants to Falun Gong-related enterprises working on technology directed against China&#x27;s Great Firewall; &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted Falun Gong and its &quot;Epoch Times&quot; media group frequently supported the Trump administration. On August 18, USAGM announced it was setting up its own Office of Internet Freedom with less strict grant requirements and began soliciting OTF&#x27;s grantees to apply to the new office. On August 20, OTF sued USAGM in the US Court for Federal Claims for withholding nearly $20 million in previously agreed grant funds. On October 15, summary judgment was granted nullifying Pack&#x27;s attempt to replace the OTF board.

On September 29, six senior USAGM officials filed a whistleblower complaint in which they alleged that Pack or one of his aides had ordered research conducted into the voting history of at least one agency employee, which would be a violation of laws protecting civil servants from undue political influence. NPR reported that two Pack aides had compiled a report on VOA White House bureau chief Steven L. Herman&#x27;s social media postings and other writings in an attempt to charge him with a conflict of interest, and that the agency released a conflict of interest policy stating in part that a &quot;journalist who on Facebook &#x27;likes&#x27; a comment or political cartoon that aggressively attacks or disparages the President must recuse themselves from covering the President.&quot; A preliminary injunction issued on November 20 barred Pack &quot;from making personnel decisions involving journalists at the networks; from directly communicating with editors and journalists employed by them; and from investigating any editors or news stories produced by them,&quot; and characterized the investigation of Herman as an &quot;unconstitutional prior restraint&quot; of his, his editors&#x27;, and fellow journalists&#x27; free speech.

Suspended officials from Voice of America sued the agency news outlet on October 8. They accused Pack of using Voice of America as a vehicle to promote the personal agenda of President Trump and of violating a statutory firewall intended to prevent political interference with the agency, and they sought their reinstatement.

In June 2020, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden&#x27;s campaign told Vox News that Biden would fire Pack if Biden won election. In November 2020, US District Court Judge Beryl Howell found Pack violated the First Amendment rights of Voice of America journalists.

In December 2020, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Pack was refusing to cooperate with President-elect Biden&#x27;s transition team and, in an end run around the court order, had persuaded VOA Acting Director Biberaj to step down, replacing him with Robert Reilly, a former VOA director who had written critically of Muslims, gays, and lesbians. On December 19, 33 days before President-elect Biden&#x27;s inauguration, Pack named Ted Lipien, a former VOA veteran journalist who headed the Polish Service during the final struggle for democracy in Poland in the 1980s and a former acting associate director of VOA who, according to NPR, &quot;became a sharp critic of USAGM, VOA and the other affiliated networks on a pair of blogs&quot; and &quot;of the three network presidents affected, the only one without established partisan ties,&quot; as head of RFE/RL, and Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, a writer for &quot;Breitbart&quot; and &quot;The Washington Times&quot; who had claimed President Obama &quot;hates America,&quot; as head of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting. On December 30, NPR reported Pack was attempting to add contractual language that would make it impossible to fire the broadcasting board members he had installed for two years, after which they could only be fired &quot;for cause.&quot; Reportedly the new contracts were withdrawn after inquiries from media and Congress.
On January 11, 2021, VOA interim director Reilly ordered veteran reporter Patsy Widakuswara off the White House beat. Earlier that day, Widakuswara had followed US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo out of the building after his speech criticizing the VOA and his VOA-sponsored interview with VOA Director Robert Reilly during which reporters were not allowed to ask questions. Widakuswara asked Pompeo what he was doing to repair the international reputation of the U.S. and whether he regretted saying there would be a second Trump administration. The theme of the preceding interview with VOA Director Robert Reilly was reportedly the dangers of censorship. In response, dozens of VOA journalists, including Widakuswara, wrote and circulated a petition calling on Reilly and public affairs specialist Elizabeth Robbins to resign. In a statement, U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Gregory Meeks and ranking member Michael McCaul said, &quot;Absent a legitimate reason for this move, which has not been provided, we believe she should be reinstated&quot;. Widakuswara was reinstated to the White House beat after President Biden requested the resignation of Michael Pack.

On January 19, the nonprofit Government Accountability Project, representing fired USAGM employees and whistleblowers, sent a letter to the congressional foreign affairs committees, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, and the Inspector General of the US Department of State. The letter said that Pack had hired the McGuireWoods law firm to investigate USAGM employees and the OTF at a cost of over $2 million in the last quarter of 2020, bypassing US government investigators including USAGM&#x27;s own Office of Human Resources, and called for further investigation of what it termed a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; later reported that a second law firm, Caplin &amp; Drysdale, had also been granted a similar no-bid contract in possible violation of federal contracting regulations for a total cost of $4 million.

Also on January 19, the last full day of the Trump presidency, Pack named a slate of five directors to head each of the three USAGM boards for RFE/RL, Radio Free Asia, and Middle East Broadcasting Networks: conservative radio talk show host Blanquita Cullum, Liberty Counsel officer Johnathan Alexander, former White House staffer Amanda Milius, conservative writer Roger Simon, and Center for the National Interest Fellow Christian Whiton.

The following day, Pack resigned at the request of the Biden administration. On January 21, Shapiro resigned from the Office of Cuba Broadcasting. Biden named veteran VOA journalist Kelu Chao to replace Pack. Chao in turn dismissed Riley and Robbins from VOA, naming Yolanda Lopez, another VOA veteran, as acting director; Lopez had also been reassigned in the wake of the Pompeo interview. On January 22, the Biden administration fired Victoria Coates and her deputy Robert Greenway from the Middle East Broadcasting Networks, naming Kelley Sullivan as acting head.

====Second Administration (2025-2029)====

In December 2024, Donald Trump, as president-elect, announced Kari Lake would be his choice for VOA Director. Lake had lost elections for Arizona governor and senator, advanced false claims around both her and Trump&#x27;s election losses and left her previous job with the Phoenix, Arizona affiliate of Fox News after controversies including spreading COVID-19 misinformation. Though the president may make a nomination, under the International Broadcasting Act only the International Broadcasting Advisory Board has the authority to approve the appointment or removal of the VOA Director.

On April 19, 2017, the VOA Mandarin Service interviewed Chinese real estate tycoon Guo Wengui in a live broadcast. The government of China warned VOA representatives not to interview Guo about his &quot;unsubstantiated allegations&quot;. The interview was scheduled by the team for three hours. After Guo alleged that he had evidence of corruption among the members of the Politburo Standing Committee of China, the highest political authority of China, the interview was abruptly cut off by VOA leadership, after one hour and 17 minutes. Guo&#x27;s allegations involved Fu Zhenhua and Wang Qishan (a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, and the leader of the anti-graft movement).

On August 27, four U.S. Congressmen requested that the Office of Inspector General (OIG) conduct an investigation into the interruption. The OIG investigation concluded that the VOA leadership decision to curtail the Guo interview was based solely on journalistic best practices, rather than due to any pressure from the Chinese government. Another investigation, by Mark Feldstein, Chair of Broadcast Journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park, concluded that &quot;VOA’s senior management did its best to make decisions consistent with journalism’s best practices and industry standards,” and “was not improperly influenced by the Chinese government or anyone else. The failure [of the VOA Mandarin Service interview team] to comply with leadership&#x27;s instructions during the Guo interview &#x27;was a colossal and unprecedented violation of journalistic professionalism and broadcast industry standards.&#x27;&quot; The Feldstein report also noted that &quot;There had been a grossly negligent approach&quot; by the VOA Mandarin Service interview team to pre-interview vetting, and failure to &quot;corroborate the authenticity of Guo&#x27;s evidence or interview other sources,&quot; in violation of industry standards. The VOA Mandarin Service interview team apparently &quot;demonstrated greater loyalty to its source than to its employer  at the expense of basic journalistic standards of accuracy, verification, and fairness,&quot; the Feldstein report concluded.

===Relay station used as a CIA black site===
It has been reported that a Voice of America relay station in Udon Thani Province, Thailand was used as a CIA black site referred to as &quot;Cat&#x27;s Eye&quot; or &quot;Detention Site Green&quot;.

===Horn of Africa service===

The Amharic Service was started in 1982. From 1982 to 1986, the VOA service had a mix of staff consisting of former members of the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (EPRP) and US-educated staff without strong political involvement in the 1974 Ethiopian Revolution and the associated student movement of the revolutionary period. Reporting was mostly critical of the Derg led by Mengistu Haile Mariam.

The 1986 to 1996 phase was according to Annette Sheckler, who became head of the VOA Horn of Africa Service in December 1998, opposed to the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front (TPLF)/Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), which took control of Ethiopia in 1991. According to Sheckler, the reporting became more politicized due to the loss of qualified staff, the role of EPRP-supporting staff being opposed to the TPLF government, and the role of former Derg officials who were recruited to the Service. US ambassadors to Ethiopia Mark Bass, Irvin Hicks, and David Shinn objected to what they saw as a lack of balance in the Service. Sheckler believed the Chief of the Horn of Africa service&#x27;s EPRP background was a factor in what she viewed as imbalanced reporting. Broadcasts in Tigrinya and Oromo were added in addition to Amhara. Sheckler sees the 18-month period during 1996–98, with a new temporary service Chief, as having become &quot;essentially ungovernable&quot; with a &quot;legacy of personal animosity, hostility and complete lack of professionalism&quot;. Sheckler described the June 1998 phase of the Eritrean–Ethiopian War as exacerbating ethnic conflicts within the service. Sheckler wrote memos to VOA leadership describing her assessment of serious problems in the service, and was fired on November 20, 1998, officially for &quot;a lack of professional journalistic ethics&quot;; she describes the reason for her firing as &quot;telling the truth&quot;.

Peter Heinlein led the service from 2012 to 2014. In 2013, he wrote a complaint about his view of problems in the service. He saw a significant flaw being the confusion of roles in which translators, untrained in the principles and methods of journalism, took on the role of journalists. The service was mostly seen as anti-Ethiopian government until 2018, when Negussie Mengesha, the head of the VOA Africa division for several years, met the newly appointed Ethiopian prime minister Abiy Ahmed.

In May 2021, several former employees accused VOA&#x27;s Amharic service, under the leadership of Negussie Mengesha, of being biased in favor of the government of Abiy Ahmed, including failing to report on atrocities committed during the Tigray War. VOA journalist Jason Patinkin said that he had reported the problems &quot;at every level of the VOA hierarchy&quot;. Patinkin resigned from the service, saying that VOA had &quot;sided with the perpetrators both by commission and omission&quot; of &quot;potential crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and perhaps even genocide&quot;.

In June 2021, &quot;Mail &amp; Guardian&quot; reported on an investigation based on &quot;hundreds of internal memos and interviews with about a dozen former and current members&quot; of the VOA Horn of Africa service. &quot;Mail &amp; Guardian&quot; stated that during the Tigray War, the only major foreign news service that was not harassed by Ethiopian security services was VOA. VOA gave frequent coverage to the Mai Kadra massacre, mostly attributed to Tigrayan youth and documented by Amnesty International, while later focusing on the Ethiopian government&#x27;s dismissal of Amnesty International&#x27;s report on the Axum massacre rather than on the methods and content of the report itself. During 107 meetings of the Horn of Africa service from November 4, 2020, to April 30, 2021, during the Tigray War, most (81%) of the meetings did not have approvals by Tizita Belachew, head of the service, or by Solomon Abate, of stories on the war that included Tigrayan points of view; a majority of the stories only showed government or military officials&#x27; points of view; a fifth of the meetings had no reports on the war. Instructions emailed to staff stated that the terms &quot;civil war&quot; and &quot;war&quot; were forbidden in reporting on the Tigray War, with Scott Stearns writing on 14 November, according to &quot;Mail &amp; Guardian&quot;, &quot;There are to be no deviations from these instructions by any member of any Africa division language service on any platform.&quot;

=== Twitter label controversy ===
After Elon Musk acquired social media platform Twitter, in April 2023 National Public Radio&#x27;s main Twitter account was briefly designated as &quot;US state-affiliated media&quot;, a label typically reserved for foreign media outlets that directly represented the point of view of their respective governments, like Russia&#x27;s RT and China&#x27;s Xinhua. A few days later, Twitter changed the designation of NPR&#x27;s account from &quot;state-affiliated&quot; to &quot;government-funded&quot;. Twitter then added the label to other sources such as PBS, the BBC, and Voice of America, which all three objected to. VOA criticized the decision, stating &quot;the label gives the impression that VOA is not an independent outlet,&quot; and that &quot;its editorial independence is protected by regulations and a firewall.&quot;

===Hamas coverage===
After the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, an email was sent to Voice of America staff from the associate editor for news standards with guidance related to how to refer to the actions (&quot;terrorist acts&quot; or &quot;acts of terror&quot;) and advice about how to refer to individual members of Hamas, i.e. to use the term &quot;terrorist&quot; only in direct quotes from sources. At the time, VOA was not the only news outlet with journalists discussing how to objectively refer to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Six Republican members of Congress signed a letter sent by Senator Bill Hagerty, which criticized and strongly objected to the editorial guidance about how to refer to individual members of Hamas. USAGM chief executive Amanda Bennett sent a letter to the senators to clarify that the VOA email was guidance only, and &quot;There is no policy prohibiting the use of the words &#x27;terror,&#x27; &#x27;terrorism,&#x27; or &#x27;terrorist&#x27;&quot; at VOA, and stating the news organizations within USAGM &quot;counsel care and attention in the use of the words but do not place any restrictions on the appropriate use.&quot; The controversy prompted Congress to reduce the budget of VOA&#x27;s parent organization, USAGM.

== In different regions ==

===China===

A study was done on Chinese students in America. It found that through the VOA, they disapproved of the actions of the Chinese government. Another study was done on Chinese scholars in America, and found that the VOA had an effect on their political beliefs. Their political beliefs did not change in relation to China, though, as they did not tend to believe the VOA&#x27;s reports on China.

===Kurdistan and Iran===

VOA&#x27;s service in Iran had a negative impact on Kurds and Kurdistan according to the publication &quot;Kurdish Life&quot; in 2000. They claimed that the VOA exacerbated the conflict between the Talabani and the Barzani. They further claimed that the VOA covered up wrongful imprisonments, wrongful arrests, and the building of extremist mosques. According to the same publication, Kurds were being turned into fanatics, and a new generation of terrorists was forming because of the VOA. They claimed the VOA was doing this to help PUK.

=== Pakistan ===

The VOA&#x27;s DEEWA Radio airs in Pakistan. Although in 2015 some listeners were suspicious that the program was promoting an American agenda, others said they were experiencing a positive effect. Some listeners felt that the programs were giving a voice to the voiceless, giving them a sense of empowerment. In 2018, the Pakistani authorities blocked the website of VOA&#x27;s Pashto and Urdu language radio service.

=== Russia ===
In response to the request of the United States Department of Justice that RT register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, Russia&#x27;s Justice Ministry Konovalov labeled Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty as foreign agents in December 2017.

=== Turkey ===
On June 30, 2022, the Turkish media watchdog, Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK), blocked access to VOA&#x27;s website amerikaninsesi.com in Turkey because VOA had not applied for the necessary licence, which would subject VOA to certain obligations. The RTÜK regulation requires foreign news outlets that publish in Turkey to apply for publication licenses, mandates that at least half of the media organization be owned by a Turkish citizen, and would force VOA to remove content deemed inappropriate by RTÜK. VOA Turkish subsequently broadcast over a different VOA website domain name, voaturkce.com, which in August 2023 was blocked as well. VOA said that &quot;Given VOA&#x27;s status as a public service international broadcaster legally required to provide &#x27;accurate, objective, and comprehensive&#x27; news coverage to its global audience, VOA cannot comply with any directive intended to enable censorship.&quot; VOA Turkey, after it was blocked, shared instructions on its social media accounts as to how to use a VPN to access its content.

== Reception ==
Voice of America is seen by some listeners as having a positive impact and serving as US diplomacy, while others, like University of Peshawar&#x27;s lecturer Faizullah Jan, see it as American propaganda.

<text>Henry Aldrich (15 January 1648 – 14 December 1710) was an English theologian, philosopher, architect, and composer.

==Life==
Aldrich was educated at Westminster School under Dr Richard Busby. In 1662, he entered Christ Church, Oxford, and in 1689 was made Dean in succession to the Roman Catholic John Massey, who had fled to the Continent. In 1692, he became Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford until 1695. In 1702, he was appointed Rector of Wem in Shropshire, but continued to reside at Oxford, where he died on 14 December 1710. He was buried in Christ Church Cathedral without any memorial, at his own request. However, a medallion portrait memorial was erected to his memory in 1732 in Oxford Cathedral sculpted by Henry Cheere.

==Works==

Henry Aldrich was a man of unusually varied gifts. A classical scholar of fair merits, he is best known as the author of a little book on logic (&quot;Artis Logicæ Compendium&quot;). Although not innovative in the field of Logic itself (it closely follows Peter of Spain&#x27;s &quot;Summulae Logicales&quot;), its insistent use by generations of Oxford students has shown it to be of great synthetic and didactic value: the Compendium continued to be read at Oxford (in Mansel&#x27;s revised edition) until long past the middle of the 19th century.

Aldrich also composed a number of anthems and church services of high merit, and adapted much of the music of Palestrina and Carissimi to English words with great skill and judgment. To him we owe the well-known catch, &quot;Hark, the bonny Christ Church bells.&quot;


Evidence of his skill as an architect may be seen in the church and campanile of All Saints Church, Oxford, and in three sides of the so-called Peckwater Quadrangle of Christ Church, which were erected after his designs. He bore a great reputation for conviviality&#x27;, and wrote a humorous Latin version of the popular ballad &quot;A soldier and a sailor, A tinker and a tailor&quot;, etc.

Another specimen of his wit is furnished by the following epigram of the five reasons for drinking:

:If on my theme I rightly think,
:There are five reasons why men drink:—
:Good wine; a friend; because I&#x27;m dry;
:Or lest I should be by and by;
:Or — any other reason why.

This epigram is a translation of the following Latin dictum attributed by the Menagiana to Jacques Sirmond:

:&quot;Si bene quid memini, causae sunt quinque bibendi;&quot;
:&quot;Hospitis adventus, praesens sitis atque futura,&quot;
:&quot;Aut vini bonitas, aut quaelibet altera causa.&quot;
Aldrich had a large personal library of ca. 3000 books, 8000 pieces of music, and 2000 engravings which he bequeathed to Christ Church upon his death. His engravings constitute one of the earliest surviving English collections in this field.

<doc id="103194" wikidata="Q654136" url="?curid=103194" title="Leidenfrost effect">
<text>The Leidenfrost effect is a physical phenomenon in which a liquid, close to a solid surface of another body that is significantly hotter than the liquid&#x27;s boiling point, produces an insulating vapor layer that keeps the liquid from boiling rapidly. Because of this repulsive force, a droplet hovers over the surface, rather than making physical contact with it. The effect is named after the German doctor Johann Gottlob Leidenfrost, who described it in &quot;A Tract About Some Qualities of Common Water&quot;.

This is most commonly seen when cooking, when drops of water are sprinkled onto a hot pan. If the pan&#x27;s temperature is at or above the Leidenfrost point, which is approximately for water, the water skitters across the pan and takes longer to evaporate than it would take if the water droplets had been sprinkled onto a cooler pan.

== Details ==

The effect can be seen as drops of water are sprinkled onto a pan at various times as it heats up. Initially, as the temperature of the pan is just below , the water flattens out and slowly evaporates, or if the temperature of the pan is well below , the water stays liquid. As the temperature of the pan rises above , the water droplets hiss when touching the pan, and these droplets evaporate quickly. When the temperature exceeds the Leidenfrost point, the Leidenfrost effect appears. On contact with the pan, the water droplets bunch up into small balls of water and skitter around, lasting much longer than when the temperature of the pan was lower. This effect works until a much higher temperature causes any further drops of water to evaporate too quickly to cause this effect.

The effect happens because, at temperatures at or above the Leidenfrost point, the bottom part of the water droplet vaporizes immediately on contact with the hot pan. The resulting gas suspends the rest of the water droplet just above it, preventing any further direct contact between the liquid water and the hot pan. As steam has much poorer thermal conductivity than the metal pan, further heat transfer between the pan and the droplet is slowed down dramatically. This also results in the drop being able to skid around the pan on the layer of gas just under it.

The temperature at which the Leidenfrost effect appears is difficult to predict. Even if the volume of the drop of liquid stays the same, the Leidenfrost point may be quite different, with a complicated dependence on the properties of the surface, as well as any impurities in the liquid. Some research has been conducted into a theoretical model of the system, but it is quite complicated.

The effect was also described by the Victorian steam boiler designer, William Fairbairn, in reference to its effect on massively reducing heat transfer from a hot iron surface to water, such as within a boiler. In a pair of lectures on boiler design, he cited the work of Pierre Hippolyte Boutigny (1798–1884) and Professor Bowman of King&#x27;s College, London, in studying this. A drop of water that was vaporized almost immediately at persisted for 152 seconds at . Lower temperatures in a boiler firebox might evaporate water more quickly as a result; compare Mpemba effect. An alternative approach was to increase the temperature beyond the Leidenfrost point. Fairbairn considered this, too, and may have been contemplating the flash steam boiler, but considered the technical aspects insurmountable for the time.

The Leidenfrost point may also be taken to be the temperature for which the hovering droplet lasts longest.

It has been demonstrated that it is possible to stabilize the Leidenfrost vapor layer of water by exploiting superhydrophobic surfaces. In this case, once the vapor layer is established, cooling never collapses the layer, and no nucleate boiling occurs; the layer instead slowly relaxes until the surface is cooled.

Droplets of different liquids with different boiling temperatures will also exhibit a Leidenfrost effect with respect to each other and repel each other.

The Leidenfrost effect has been used for the development of high sensitivity ambient mass spectrometry. Under the influence of the Leidenfrost condition, the levitating droplet does not release molecules, and the molecules are enriched inside the droplet. At the last moment of droplet evaporation, all the enriched molecules release in a short time period and thereby increase the sensitivity.

A heat engine based on the Leidenfrost effect has been prototyped; it has the advantage of extremely low friction.

The effect also applies when the surface is at room temperature but the liquid is cryogenic, allowing liquid nitrogen droplets to harmlessly roll off exposed skin. Conversely, the &quot;inverse Leidenfrost effect&quot; lets drops of relatively warm liquid levitate on a bath of liquid nitrogen.

== Leidenfrost point ==
The Leidenfrost point signifies the onset of stable film boiling. It represents the point on the boiling curve where the heat flux is at the minimum and the surface is completely covered by a vapor blanket. Heat transfer from the surface to the liquid occurs by conduction and radiation through the vapour. In 1756, Leidenfrost observed that water droplets supported by the vapor film slowly evaporate as they move about on the hot surface. As the surface temperature is increased, radiation through the vapor film becomes more significant and the heat flux increases with increasing excess temperature.

The minimum heat flux for a large horizontal plate can be derived from Zuber&#x27;s equation,

formula_1

where the properties are evaluated at saturation temperature. Zuber&#x27;s constant, formula_2, is approximately 0.09 for most fluids at moderate pressures.

== Heat transfer correlations ==

The heat transfer coefficient may be approximated using Bromley&#x27;s equation,

formula_3

where formula_4 is the outside diameter of the tube. The correlation constant &quot;C&quot; is 0.62 for horizontal cylinders and vertical plates, and 0.67 for spheres. Vapor properties are evaluated at film temperature.

For stable film boiling on a horizontal surface, Berenson has modified Bromley&#x27;s equation to yield,

formula_5

For vertical tubes, Hsu and Westwater have correlated the following equation,

formula_6

where m is the mass flow rate in formula_7 at the upper end of the tube.

At excess temperatures above that at the minimum heat flux, the contribution of radiation becomes appreciable, and it becomes dominant at high excess temperatures. The total heat transfer coefficient is thus a combination of the two. Bromley has suggested the following equations for film boiling from the outer surface of horizontal tubes:

formula_8

If formula_9,

formula_10

The effective radiation coefficient, formula_11 can be expressed as,

formula_12

where formula_13 is the emissivity of the solid and formula_14 is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant.

== Pressure field in a Leidenfrost droplet ==

The equation for the pressure field in the vapor region between the droplet and the solid surface can be solved for using the standard momentum and continuity equations using a Boundary layer model. In this model for the sake of simplicity in solving, a linear temperature profile and a parabolic velocity profile are assumed within the vapor phase. The heat transfer within the vapor phase is assumed to be through conduction. With these approximations, the Navier–Stokes equations can be solved to get the pressure field. 

== Leidenfrost temperature and surface tension effects ==

The Leidenfrost temperature is the property of a given set of solid–liquid pair. The temperature of the solid surface beyond which the liquid undergoes the Leidenfrost phenomenon is termed the Leidenfrost temperature. Calculation of the Leidenfrost temperature involves the calculation of the minimum film boiling temperature of a fluid. Berenson obtained a relation for the minimum film boiling temperature from minimum heat flux arguments. While the equation for the minimum film boiling temperature, which can be found in the reference above, is quite complex, the features of it can be understood from a physical perspective. One critical parameter to consider is the surface tension. The proportional relationship between the minimum film boiling temperature and surface tension is to be expected, since fluids with higher surface tension need higher quantities of heat flux for the onset of nucleate boiling. Since film boiling occurs after nucleate boiling, the minimum temperature for film boiling should have a proportional dependence on the surface tension.

Henry developed a model for Leidenfrost phenomenon which includes transient wetting and microlayer evaporation. Since the Leidenfrost phenomenon is a special case of film boiling, the Leidenfrost temperature is related to the minimum film boiling temperature via a relation which factors in the properties of the solid being used. While the Leidenfrost temperature is not directly related to the surface tension of the fluid, it is indirectly dependent on it through the film boiling temperature. For fluids with similar thermophysical properties, the one with higher surface tension usually has a higher Leidenfrost temperature.

For example, for a saturated water–copper interface, the Leidenfrost temperature is {{convert|257|C}}. The Leidenfrost temperatures for glycerol and common alcohols are significantly smaller because of their lower surface tension values (density and viscosity differences are also contributing factors.)

== Reactive Leidenfrost effect ==
Non-volatile materials were discovered in 2015 to also exhibit a &#x27;reactive Leidenfrost effect&#x27;, whereby solid particles were observed to float above hot surfaces and skitter around erratically. Detailed characterization of the reactive Leidenfrost effect was completed for small particles of cellulose (~0.5 mm) on high temperature polished surfaces by high speed photography. Cellulose was shown to decompose to short-chain oligomers which melt and wet smooth surfaces with increasing heat transfer associated with increasing surface temperature. Above {{convert|675|C}}, cellulose was observed to exhibit transition boiling with violent bubbling and associated reduction in heat transfer. Liftoff of the cellulose droplet (depicted at the right) was observed to occur above about {{convert|750|C}}, associated with a dramatic reduction in heat transfer.

High speed photography of the reactive Leidenfrost effect of cellulose on porous surfaces (macroporous alumina) was also shown to suppress the reactive Leidenfrost effect and enhance overall heat transfer rates to the particle from the surface. The new phenomenon of a &#x27;reactive Leidenfrost (RL) effect&#x27; was characterized by a dimensionless quantity, (φRL= τconv/τrxn), which relates the time constant of solid particle heat transfer to the time constant of particle reaction, with the reactive Leidenfrost effect occurring for 10−1&lt; φRL&lt; 10+1. The reactive Leidenfrost effect with cellulose will occur in numerous high temperature applications with carbohydrate polymers, including biomass conversion to biofuels, preparation and cooking of food, and tobacco use.

The Leidenfrost effect has also been used as a means to promote chemical change of various organic liquids through their conversion by thermal decomposition into various products. Examples include decomposition of ethanol, diethyl carbonate, and glycerol.

==In popular culture==
In Jules Verne&#x27;s 1876 book &quot;Michael Strogoff&quot;, the protagonist is saved from being blinded with a hot blade by evaporating tears.

In the 2009 season 7 finale of &quot;MythBusters&quot;, &quot;Mini Myth Mayhem&quot;, the team demonstrated that a person can wet their hand and briefly dip it into molten lead without injury, using the Leidenfrost effect as the scientific basis.

<text>Astrebla Downs is a national park in Shire of Diamantina, Queensland, Australia.

== Geography ==
Astrebla Downs is located in the Channel Country of outback Queensland, 1298 km west of Brisbane. The landscape is flat and barren with few trees. The average elevation of the terrain is 108 metres.

== Animals ==
The park received an award in March 2007 by the WWF for being among the top 10 reserves of the decade. Recognition was given for the successful efforts to protect the bilby, an endangered mammal native to Australia. By 2008 it was estimated the park contained a bilby population of around 300. In 2009, a plague of long-haired rats descended on the park. The large numbers of rats attract feral cats to the area, which pose a threat to the bilby. Between 2011 and 2021, control measures have got rid of more than 3,000 cats, and
471 bilbies were spotted on a survey in June 2021.

The park is home to the kowari, a tiny carnivorous marsupial which is a vulnerable species in Queensland, also threatened by feral cats. The animal had not been photographed anywhere in around ten years before June 2021, when photographs were taken during a survey covering nearly of tracks, in which a record number – 14 – were spotted in the park. None have been spotted at the nearby Diamantina National Park since 2012.

Astrebla Downs is also home to the stripe-faced dunnart.

==Birds==
With Diamantina National Park, Astrebla Downs National Park forms part of the 7,627 km2 Diamantina and Astrebla Grasslands Important Bird Area, identified by BirdLife International as such because it is one of few sites known for the critically endangered night parrot. It also supports globally important populations of the plains-wanderer, Australian bustard, straw-necked ibis, white-necked heron, inland dotterel, Bourke&#x27;s parrot, black and pied honeyeaters, gibberbird, Hall&#x27;s babbler, chestnut-breasted quail-thrush, cinnamon quail-thrush and spinifexbird.

<text>Barron Gorge National Park is a protected area in the Cairns Region, Queensland, Australia. It lies predominantly within the locality of Barron Gorge.

== Geography ==
The park is 1,404 km northwest of Brisbane and from Kuranda. Barron Gorge is part of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area. Skyrail Rainforest Cableway is a 7.5 kilometre scenic cableway running above the Barron Gorge National Park in the Wet Tropics of Queensland&#x27;s World Heritage Area north of Cairns which has won more than 25 awards. The Kuranda Scenic Railway line passes through the park with a station at Barron Falls. Two trains run from and return to Cairns daily. The original weir, constructed in 1934 at the top of the falls, is visible from the station lookout and Skyrail&#x27;s Barron Falls Station lookouts.

==Landforms==
Barron Gorge formed where the Barron River passes over the eastern escarpment of the Atherton Tablelands. Barron Falls cascade 265 m to the gorge below. Two waterfalls—Stoney Creek Falls and Surprise Creek Falls—exist on tributaries of the Barron River within the park. Slopes around the gorge are steep with some at a 45° angle. This made construction of the railway hazardous. 23 people died during its construction.

==History==

In 1885, the explorer Archibald Meston described the Barron Falls in flood where the raging waters &quot;rush together like wild horses as they enter the straight in the dread finish of their last race ... (where) the currents of air created by the cataract waved the branches of the trees hundreds of feet overhead ... the rock shook like a mighty steamer tumbling with the vibrations of the screw.&quot;

In 1935, the waters of the Barron River were harnessed in the Barron Gorge Hydroelectric Power Station to generate Queensland&#x27;s first hydroelectric power. Two hundred metres from the base of the Barron Falls an underground power station was carved into the cliff face. Water was delivered through pipes to drive the turbines, two 1,200 kW turbo-alternators. The substation, workshops and staff houses were built around the area now forming the Skyrail station.

The Djabugandji Bama (Aboriginal people) are the traditional owners of the area known as Djirri Nyundu Nyrrumba, which includes Barron Gorge National Park. Ownership of the park returned to its traditional owners on 17 December 2004. This is the first park in Queensland to have a native title determination. Visitors to the park have not faced any changes under the new owners but Aboriginals were then able to hold traditional religious ceremonies.

==Flora and fauna==
Bird&#x27;s-nest fern and elkhorn ferns grow amongst Candlenut, Corkwood, Native olive and False Red Sandalwood trees at the bottom of the gorge.

The park forms part of the Wooroonooran Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports populations of a range of bird species endemic to Queensland&#x27;s Wet Tropics. Noisy pittas and the orange-footed scrubfowl are two species of bird that may be commonly seen. The southern cassowary is occasionally spotted in the southern section of the park. Nocturnal animals are relatively common. These include a variety of possums and flying foxes as well as Lumholtz&#x27;s tree-kangaroo and the northern quoll.

<text>Kalkajaka National Park is a protected area in Shire of Cook, Queensland, Australia.

== Geography ==
The park is 25 km south west of Cooktown. It is managed and protected as a national park under the Nature Conservation Act 1992.

The main feature of the park is the mass of granite boulders, some the size of houses. The absence of soil between the boulders and rocks create a maze of gaps and passages, which can be used to penetrate inside the mountain. These rocks can become extremely hot.

The area has a bad reputation as numerous people and those searching for the missing have disappeared without trace. The Mulligan Highway marks the western border of the park.

==Natural history==
The national park’s distinctive hard black boulders (often termed granite) and range are composed of the igneous felsic intrusive Trevethan Granodiorite which is predominantly a white to grey, medium-grained, porphyritic biotite monzogranite to granodiorite. The age of the intrusive is Late Permian and has been dated from 259.1 to 251.9 million years old. The Trevethan Granodiorite was originally magma that slowly solidified under the earths crust.

The softer land surfaces above the solidified magma eroded away over time, leaving the magma&#x27;s fractured top to be exposed as a mountain of grey granite boulders blackened by a film of microscopic blue-green algae growing on the exposed surfaces. Colder rains falling on the dark, heated granite boulders causes the boulders to progressively fracture, break, and slowly disintegrate, sometimes explosively.

==Cultural history==
Kalkajaka (&quot;Black Mountain&quot;) is a heavily significant feature of the Kuku Nyungkal people&#x27;s cultural landscape. Kalkajaka translates to &quot;place of the spear&quot;.

Queensland&#x27;s Department of Environment and Natural Resources has been advised of at least four sites of particular mythological significance within the area as follows:
&quot;There are at least four sites of religious or mythological significance on the mountain. These are the Kambi, a large rock with a cave where flying-foxes are found; Julbanu, a big grey kangaroo-shaped rock looking toward Cooktown; Birmba, a stone facing toward Helenvale where sulphur-crested cockatoos are seen; and a taboo place called Yirrmbal near the foot of the range.&quot;
Kalkajaka also features strongly in local, more non-Aboriginal cultural landscapes, some of which has also been described by Queensland&#x27;s Department of Environment and Resource Management as follows:
&quot;When European colonists arrived late last century, they added to the many Aboriginal legends of the area with a few of their own. Stories abound of people, horses and whole mobs of cattle disappearing into the labyrinth of rocks, never to be seen again&quot;
It is believed that those who vanished most probably fell into one of the chasms under the rocks or after entering one of these places became lost. It is estimated only three in ten would survive such falls, wandering below the Earth&#x27;s surface with only ground water streams and insects to nourish them. A minority group is referred to by colonists as the Outback Moles (perhaps in reference to New York&#x27;s underground population).

==Ecology==
The park&#x27;s mountains are located at the northernmost end of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, where world heritage listed wet tropical forests meet drier savanna woodlands - making it a natural refuge for once more widespread, now isolated relict fauna.

Queensland&#x27;s Department of Environment and Resource Management advises, for instance, the relatively small, unusual &quot;Black Mountain&quot; environment is the world&#x27;s only habitat for at least three animals: the Black Mountain boulderfrog or rock haunting frog (&quot;Cophixalus saxatilis&quot;); the Black Mountain skink (&quot;Carlia scirtetis&quot;); and the Black Mountain gecko (&quot;Nactus galgajuga&quot;). This makes the area one of Australia&#x27;s most restricted habitats for endemic fauna.

==Facilities==
Camping is not permitted in the park. There are no walking tracks and no facilities for picnics. There is a viewing platform that features interpretive displays.

<text>Blackdown Tableland is a national park in the Central Highlands Region, Queensland, Australia.

== Geography ==
The park is in Central Queensland, northwest of Brisbane. The mountainous terrain of the tablelands provides a unique landscape featuring gorges, waterfalls and diverse vegetation.

The Blackdown Tableland is a sandstone plateau rising abruptly from the plains below. Many creeks on the Tableland have developed gorges and waterfalls along their courses, the most notable of which drains in to the spectacular Rainbow Falls (Gudda Gumoo) over a drop. Some of the creeks on the Tableland are catchment fed by rain and often dry up, and some are spring fed and always flow even just a small amount. The national park is located in the north east of the central Queensland sandstone belt.

The tablelands are positioned at the junction of the Shotover, Expedition and Dawson Ranges. Evidence of folding is shown in the rises and depressions amongst the ranges.

== History ==
It is the traditional home of the Ghungalu people, whose rock art can be found in the park.

&quot;Wadja&quot; (also known as &quot;Wadjigu&quot;, &quot;Wadya&quot;, &quot;Wadjainngo&quot;, &quot;Mandalgu&quot;, and &quot;Wadjigun)&quot; is an Australian Aboriginal language in Central Queensland. The language region includes the local government areas of the Aboriginal Shire of Woorabinda and Central Highlands Region, including Blackdown Tableland, the Comet River, and the Expedition Range, and the towns of Woorabinda, Springsure and Rolleston.

==Climate==
The plateau has a more temperate, local climate than the surrounding plains, supporting open forests, heath, ferns, and a variety of plants and animals, several of which are not found anywhere else. Parts of the eastern tablelands have an average rainfall of per year. Dense fog may shroud the plateau.

==Facilities==
Camping is permitted at Munall campground. There are walking tracks leading to lookouts, heritage sites and creeks. Picnic facilities are available at Yaddamen Dhina lookout.

Camping is available on Mimosa Creek in the Tableland, camping fees apply.

==Access==
Access to the area was very limited until a road was constructed in 1969 by the Queensland Forest Department. Entrance to the park is via a turn-off west of Dingo along the Capricorn Highway.

<doc id="103206" wikidata="Q581646" url="?curid=103206" title="Bladensburg National Park">
<text>Bladensburg is a national park in Shire of Winton, Queensland, Australia. It includes an area once occupied by a sheep station called Bladensburg Station.
==History==
Bladensburg lies in the area of what was once Koa tribal territory and, on white settlement, was taken over to run a sheep station, known as Bladensburg Station. This was the site of the alleged Bladensburg massacre, in which around 200 Aboriginal people were killed in 1872 at Skull Hole, on the head of Mistake Creek.

The of national park were declared in 1984.

== Geography ==

The park is northwest of Brisbane, and just south of the town of Winton.
The park features grassland plains, river flats, sandstone ranges and flat-topped mesas. The main watercourse in the park is the often dry Surprise Creek. During floods the creek becomes a braided channel.

The landscape to the south of the park has dissected tablelands with mesas and buttes and to the far south are flat sand plains.
==Description==

The park is now a protected area containing areas of high biodiversity. It is situated predominantly in the Goneaway Tablelands subregion of the Channel Country bioregion, but also contains some of the Mitchell Grass Downs bioregion. The original Bladensburg homestead, which was probably transported to the site some time in the 1910s, houses the park&#x27;s visitor information centre today. Birds common to the area include the painted firetail, rufous-crowned emu-wren and rufous-throated honeyeater.

== Attractions ==
The park contains dinosaur fossils as well as Aboriginal story places and ceremonial grounds.

Skull Hole, the site of the 1870s massacre of Aboriginal people, is preserved.
==Facilities==
Access to the park is by 16 km of road from Winton. Camping is permitted beside Surprise Creek. No water is available.

<text>Blue Lake National Park was a former protected area in Queensland, Australia, located on North Stradbroke Island about east of Brisbane.  Blue Lake National Park is now a part of the Naree Budjong Djara National Park.  Access was provided by road west of Dunwich.

In 1980, the national park was described as follows:

Blue Lake is a watertable lake in the coastal sandmass of North Stradbroke Island. The National Park is included in the large North Stradbroke Island – Central Section Interim Listing (for the Register of the National Estate). The statement for that listing places its values in a broader context.

Although only relatively small, Blue Lake contains a diversity of habitats &amp; species, including: Blue Lake, a boomerang-shaped watertable window lake; Tortoise Lagoon, a perched lake receding to swamp that fluctuates between swamp and a lagoon depending on rainfall; and other swamps; examples of dry sclerophyll forest, scrub heath, marshes, herbfields, associated linear swamps with surrounding eucalypt open forest and mallee heath. Such a wide range of features represents a large diversity of habitats.

Five major vegetation types have been mapped in the Blue Lake National Park: mid-high to tall open forest/woodlands dominated by &quot;Eucalyptus signata&quot; (Scribbly Gum), &quot;E. intermedia&quot; (Pink Bloodwood) and &quot;E. planchoniana&quot; (Planchon&#x27;s Stringybark); sedgelands (freshwater swamps) dominated by &quot;Gahnia&quot;, &quot;Sieberana&quot;, and &quot;Baumea&quot; Spp.; tall to very tall mallee shrublands comprising Pink Bloodwood, Planchon&#x27;s Stringybark, &quot;Banksia aemula&quot; (Wallum Banksia) and Scribbly Gum; closed heath of mixed shrubs including &quot;Empodisma minus&quot;; and tall to very tall open forest/woodland composed primarily of &quot;E. pilularis&quot; (Blackbutt).

The eastern tip of Blue Lake lies 1.75 km from the ocean at which point a white-sandy bottomed, fast flowing creek with steep fern covered banks, carries the Blue Lake overflow down to Eighteen Mile Swamp. Two creeks that flow permanently, and a swamp, drain into the lake. The deepest parts of the lake reach around 11m in depth.

Two crustacean species, three fresh water fish, one frog species, 12 insect species and one spider were found in the littoral of Blue Lake. Most of the littoral and planktonic insects found in Blue Lake are common and widespread throughout Australia.
The conservation park was classified in 2008 as being an IUCN Category II protected area. In 1980, it was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate.

<text>Bowling Green Bay is a national park in the City of Townsville and Shire of Burdekin, Queensland, Australia, 1,103 km northwest of Brisbane, and 28 km south of Townsville and 59 km north of Ayr. It is a Ramsar Convention listed site. The park protects diverse range of habitats including the rugged, forested landscape surrounding Mount Elliot and Saddle Mountain as well as coastal estuaries between Cape Cleveland and Cape Bowling Green.

==Landforms==
Mount Elliot rises 1,342 m and has numerous creeks on its eastern slopes, of which, Alligator Creek is the most important. The creek is a popular place to swim and to watch birds drinking the creek&#x27;s water or feeding on riparian vegetation.

The parks incorporates the floodplains of the Haughton River. This includes one of the largest wetlands on the east coast of Australia. The wetland arose as the coastal streams deposited material into the calm waters of Bowling Green Bay. It is composed of mud and sand flats, swamps, isolated hills, mangrove forests and inter-tidal flats. Behind the areas where mangroves grow are bare salt pan. These wide expanses are a unique characteristic of North Queensland wetlands produced by comparatively low rainfall and a short wet season that never washes the salt away.

==Fauna==
The brolga and magpie goose find habitat in the sedge swamps of Bowling Green Bay. The park is one of the best places to see the rarely observed zitting cisticola. Other bird species include the whistling duck, black duck, spoonbill, ibis and jabiru. Crocodiles are found in the estuarine and swamp areas.

==Facilities==
Camping in the park in permitted at the Alligator Creek campground. Bush camping is permitted at Cape Bowling Green. No open fires or domestic animals are permitted in the park.

==Access==
Access to the park is via the Bruce Highway. Cape Bowling Green is accessible via the village of Alva Beach.

<text>Broad Sound Islands National Park, also known as Broad Sounds Islands, is a national park in Shire of Livingstone, Queensland, Australia, northwest of Brisbane. Estimated average altitude is above sea level.

The park covers 48 islands from Flock Pigeon Island (near Clairview on the mainland) through to High Peak Island (the furthest from any port). Four of the islands are officially known as Broad Sound Islands (Long, Tern, Quail and Wild Duck Islands), while many others form part of the larger island chain known as the Northumberland Islands. 

Due to its remoteness and undisturbed nature, this park is a real paradise for nesting endangered species of flatback turtles.

The average summer temperature on the islands is 30 degrees, and the winter 23 degrees Celsius.

<doc id="103212" wikidata="Q928618" url="?curid=103212" title="Brook Islands National Park">
<text>The Brook Islands National Park is a national park in Cassowary Coast Region, Queensland, Australia, 1246 km northwest of Brisbane, with an area of 0.9 km2. It was established in 1994 and comprises three islands (North, Tween and Middle) which lie off the coast 7 km north-east of Cape Richards on Hinchinbrook Island and 30 km east of the nearest mainland town of Cardwell. The fourth island of the Brooks group, South Island, is not part of the national park but is protected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Public access to the three islands in the national park is prohibited in order to protect breeding birds, especially the Torresian imperial-pigeon. The islands have no roads, walking tracks or other facilities. Popular activities in the waters around the islands are boating, snorkelling and fishing. The islands are managed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service. The Park&#x27;s IUCN category is II.

==Fauna==
Up to 60,000 pied imperial-pigeons breed on the islands during summer, providing a spectacle to onlookers as they return to their nests each evening after foraging for rainforest fruits in the mainland and Hinchinbrook Island. Following regular illegal shooting of the birds there during the early and mid 20th Century, the population using the islands was subject to a long protection campaign and monitoring program by conservation activists Margaret and Arthur Thorsborne. There are also breeding colonies of bridled, black-naped, little, lesser crested and roseate terns. Beach stone-curlews breed on North Island beaches. The islands have been classified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because of the global importance of the site for pied imperial-pigeons and lesser crested terns.

== Flora ==
The plants of the Brook Islands are only partly known. North Brook Island’s predominant vegetation is a lush, well-developed rainforest with many vines (notophyll vine forest), likely to include some rare and interesting species. Humans, feral animals, and weeds and fires have had less effect on the islands than on the mainland. This has ensured the islands remain as important representative samples of island ecosystems. North Brook’s vine forests feature some very dense areas of the rare palm &quot;Arenga australasica&quot;. Although this palm is abundant on these small islands, it is rare on the mainland. Golden orchids &quot;Dendrobium discolor&quot; are abundant on the rocks near the shoreline. The vine forests are poorly known but appear not to have been subject to fire for a long time and are likely to prove botanically interesting when fully investigated. Many of the plants appear to indicate a relationship to the pied imperial-pigeons which regularly transport seed considerable distances and thus, it would appear, enrich the islands’ species diversity. Common canopy species include &quot;Semecarpus australiensis&quot; (tar tree), &quot;Palaquium galactoxylum&quot;, &quot;Myristica insipida&quot; and &quot;Alstonia scholaris.&quot; The vegetation on the sandspit of North Brook Island is particularly well-developed compared with similar locations in the area.

==History==
North Brook Island, the largest in the group, was in 1944 the venue for a series of British and American tests on the military uses of mustard gas. Pits were dug and Japanese-style dugouts were constructed to aid this testing. Virtually no trace of this remains. A documentary film relating to these and other tests, was released by Film Australia in 1989.

<text>Bunya Mountains is a national park in the South Burnett Region, Queensland, Australia.

== Geography ==
The park includes much of the mountain range called the Bunya Mountains. The park encompasses the most westerly area of subtropical rainforest in southern Queensland and the largest population of bunya pines remaining in the world. It is situated 63 km northeast of Dalby or 58 km southwest of Kingaroy.

The park is known for its abundant wildlife, permanent waterfalls and its views. The mild climate of the range means morning and evening temperatures are low. The park is accessed by a steep and winding roads and is serviced with camping grounds, a network of walking tracks and several picnic grounds.

==History==
The Wakka Wakka, Jarowair and Barrumgum tribes are the traditional owners of the Bunya Mountains and have inhabited and managed the mountains through traditional land-use management for thousands of years which included the cultural significant &quot;Bunya Feasts&quot; which would see thousands of people from surrounding tribes from Queensland and New South Wales come to the Bunya Mountains for these gatherings. The Bunya grasslands are unique relics of a much cooler climate and have existed since the last ice age, persisting due to regular burning by Aboriginal peoples over many thousands of years known as &quot;fire farming&quot;. Recent core samples confirmed that Indigenous fire management was occurring on the Bunya Mountains as far back as 9,000 years ago during the Holocene era. Evidence suggests fire farming created the largest estate management in the world of the vast state and territories of Australia, performed in ceremonies, for land control, food control and farming, and produce (native yams) harvesting by Aboriginal people for thousands of years. Fire management has enabled the grasslands to maintain their treeless characteristic, preventing rainforest and woodland species from becoming established. The balds are considered a cultural landscape and an enduring symbol of Indigenous land management which still hold significance to Indigenous people today.

The arrival of European settlers saw the removal of Indigenous communities off the Bunya Mountains ending active fire management by Indigenous people from 1860s onwards.

During the 1860s the park was logged for red cedar, bunya pine and hoop pine and the Aboriginal people were pushed out. European settlers began to visit the area and enjoy the scenery in the same decade.

The Bunya Sawmill opened in 1883. As the national park was declared in 1908, it makes it the second oldest national park in Queensland. A further addition to the park was donated by WA Russell MLA in 1927. Timber was still removed from the national park until about 1917. The last sawmill on the mountains closed in 1945.

The first walking tracks were constructed in 1939. Carbine&#x27;s chute was the first of many trenches built to assist the removal of logs off the mountains. It can be accessed by a 1.5 km track from Munros camp. The last sawmill in the area was at Wengenville, which closed in 1961. In a successful attempt to reduce the splintering and damage to logs from falling down the steep trenches the owner of the Wengenville sawmill, Lars Anderson, used a combination of tramway, winches, winders and flying foxes to transport logs.

==Flora==

Some of the parks bunya pines are estimated to be up to 600 years old and 25 metres high. The forests contain stinging nettles, wild raspberry, many vines and pockets of ferns. Other trees species in the park include white beech and silky oaks. Grass trees on Mount Kiangarow grow nearly 5 m tall and some are least several hundred years old.

Scattered throughout the mountain forests are many natural clearings known as &#x27;grassy balds&#x27;. These clearings are typically a few hectares in area and are caused by bushfires and geological conditions. Where there a slabs of unfractured basalt soil formation and root penetration is impossible, leaving a patch in the forest. There are about 100 balds, although those caused by fire are steadily being lost due to a lack of recent fires. The grassy balds have a higher biodiversity than the dense rainforests, because they are home to birds and rodents not found elsewhere in the forest.

==Fauna==
The park is home to more than 200 frogs and reptiles as well as marsupials such as pademelons, rock wallabies, swamp wallabies and an endemic subspecies of ringtail possum found only on the mountain peaks. Reptile species include the blue-tongued skink, land mullet, carpet snake, red bellied black snake and brown tree snake.

The mountains are part of the Bunya Mountains and Yarraman Important Bird Area which contains what is thought to be the largest population of the black-breasted button-quail. In the park, 120 species of bird have been recorded. Significant species include the wedge-tailed eagle, peregrine falcon, grey goshawk, brown cuckoo-dove, rose robin, eastern yellow robin, large-billed gerygone, and Australian golden whistler. The Bunya Mountains support the most westerly populations of many rainforest dwelling species, including green catbirds, regent bowerbirds, paradise riflebirds, eastern whipbirds, noisy pittas and the Australian logrunner. Some of the more commonly seen species include pied currawongs, laughing kookaburras, Australian king parrots, crimson rosellas, sulphur-crested cockatoos, red-browed finches, white-browed scrubwrens, satin bowerbirds, wonga pigeons and brush turkeys.

==Waterfalls==
The park contains a number of waterfalls including Tim Shea Falls and Mcgrory Falls.

== Management ==

The national park is currently managed by the department of national parks, recreation, sports and racing (NPRSR), There has been an integrated program of burning the unique grassland &quot;balds&quot; by Queensland Parks and Wildlife in the Bunya Mountains since the late 1990s with 27% of unburnt balds being burnt for the first time in many years. There have been difficulties in recovering a number of balds which have well established forest canopies due to decades of non-burning, these balds may be too far gone to recover. Some balds which have had significant forest species invasion have had mechanical removal and coppicing of trees to aid recovery of the balds through burning 
. Proactive fire management is a priority within the current management plan for the Bunya Mountains National Park with additional importance given to partnerships with traditional owners using traditional fire techniques in restoring and maintaining the grasslands. Australian Government initiatives such as the ‘Working on Country’ Program has been active on the mountain since 2009 allowing greater conservation action through additional rangers and resources being used to enable recovery of this unique threatened grassland landscape.

==Facilities==
There is a visitor information centre and campgrounds at Dandabah. Other campgrounds are provided at Burton&#x27;s Well and Westcott. There are a number of well-developed walking tracks, some with lookouts. Picnic facilities are provided at all campgrounds, as well as Cherry Plain.

==Access==
Roads from Toowoomba, Kingaroy, Dalby and Nanango all lead up the mountains. Steep grades mean travelling with caravans and trailers is not recommended. Smaller caravans can access the mountains via Maidenwell.

<text>Burleigh Head is a small national park at Burleigh Heads in the City of Gold Coast in South East Queensland, Australia.

== Geography ==
The park is south of Brisbane. The park is tiny yet it contains a diverse range of habitats. Tallebudgera Creek enters the ocean directly south of the park. No camping is permitted in the park. Access is via the Gold Coast Highway which passes by the park. An information centre is available.

Burleigh Head National Park is a popular place for hiking, walkers and joggers because it located in a cool climate and provides great views. There are two walking tracks in the national park, one climbing the hill to the summit which is about 88 m above sea level, called the Rainforest circuit and another leading around the headland just above sea level called the Ocean view circuit. Watching migrating whales from within the park is another popular activity.

==Landform==

The headland has steep sides and is 80 m in height. The formation of the Burleigh headland began between 23 and 25 million years ago. At this time the Tweed Volcano was active. Molten basalt lava from the volcano flowed all the way down the valleys and eroded them all. The valleys were covered in hardened sedimentary rocks before reaching what is now the Burleigh headland. Along Tallebudgera Creek there are rocky platforms and sandy beaches. On the seaside part of the park are black boulders at the base of a cliff. Upstream tidal Tallebudgera Creek has a mangrove environment.

The headland is an important cultural site for the local Aboriginal tribe known as the Minjungbal people.

==Flora==
The park preserves remnant areas of rainforest and mangrove forests. Western parts are dominated by dry eucalypt forest containing species such as brush box, forest red gum and grey ironbark. On the seaward facing slopes are Swamp she-oak, native hibiscus tree and &quot;Pandanus&quot; palms. There are also areas of heathland and tussock grassland.

==Fauna==
The Australian brush-turkey, brahminy kites, sea eagles and koalas can be found in the park. There are also lace monitors, echidnas, mountain brushtail possums, common brushtail possums and common ringtail possums. Rainbow lorikeets are commonly seen feeding on blossoms in the park.

==Walking track==
The park contains a popular walking track, known as the Oceanview Track, which connects Burleigh Heads and Tallebudgera Creek. In December 2014, the track was closed due to boulders smashing into the path as they cascaded down the slopes. The track was re-opened in mid-2015 after further at-risk boulders and rock fragments were removed.

<doc id="103216" wikidata="Q166835" url="?curid=103216" title="Wallace Stevens">
<text>Wallace Stevens (October 2, 1879 – August 2, 1955) was an American modernist poet. He was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, educated at Harvard and then New York Law School, and spent most of his life working as an executive for an insurance company in Hartford, Connecticut. 

Stevens&#x27;s first period begins with the publication of &quot;Harmonium&quot; (1923), followed by a slightly revised and amended second edition in 1930. It features, among other poems, &quot;The Emperor of Ice-Cream&quot;, &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, &quot;The Snow Man&quot;, and &quot;Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird&quot;. His second period commenced with &quot;Ideas of Order&quot; (1933), included in &quot;Transport to Summer&quot; (1947). His third and final period began with the publication of &quot;The Auroras of Autumn&quot; (1950), followed by &quot;The Necessary Angel: Essays On Reality and the Imagination&quot; (1951). 

Many of Stevens&#x27;s poems, like &quot;Anecdote of the Jar&quot;, &quot;The Man with the Blue Guitar&quot;, &quot;The Idea of Order at Key West&quot;, &quot;Of Modern Poetry&quot;, and &quot;Notes Towards a Supreme Fiction&quot;, deal with the art of making art and poetry in particular. His &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (1954) won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1955. 

==Life and career==

===Birth and early life===
Stevens was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, in 1879 into a Lutheran family of Dutch and German descent. John Zeller, his maternal great-grandfather, settled in the Susquehanna Valley in 1709 as a religious refugee.

===Education and marriage===
The son of a prosperous lawyer, Stevens attended Harvard as a non-degree three-year special student from 1897 to 1900, where he served as the 1901 president of &quot;The Harvard Advocate&quot;. According to his biographer Milton Bates, Stevens was personally introduced to the philosopher George Santayana while living in Boston and was strongly influenced by Santayana&#x27;s book &quot;Interpretations of Poetry and Religion&quot;. Holly Stevens, his daughter, recalled her father&#x27;s long dedication to Santayana when she posthumously reprinted her father&#x27;s collected letters in 1977 for Knopf. In one of his early journals, Stevens gave an account of spending an evening with Santayana in early 1900 and sympathizing with Santayana about a poor review published at that time of &quot;Interpretations&quot;. After his Harvard years, Stevens moved to New York City and briefly worked as a journalist. He then attended New York Law School, graduating with a law degree in 1903, following the example of his two other brothers with law degrees.

On a trip back to Reading in 1904, Stevens met Elsie Viola Kachel (1886–1963, also known as Elsie Moll), a young woman who had worked as a saleswoman, milliner, and stenographer. After a long courtship, he married her in 1909 over the objections of his parents, who considered her poorly educated and lower-class. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 2009, &quot;Nobody from his family attended the wedding, and Stevens never again visited or spoke to his parents during his father&#x27;s lifetime.&quot; A daughter, Holly, was born in 1924. She was baptized Episcopalian and later posthumously edited her father&#x27;s letters and a collection of his poems.
In 1913, the Stevenses rented a New York City apartment from sculptor Adolph A. Weinman, who made a bust of Elsie. Her striking profile may have been used on Weinman&#x27;s 1916–1945 Mercury dime and the Walking Liberty Half Dollar. In later years, Elsie Stevens began to exhibit symptoms of mental illness and the marriage suffered as a result, but the couple remained married. In his biography of Stevens, Paul Mariani relates that the couple was largely estranged, separated by nearly a full decade in age, though living in the same home by the mid-1930s. Mariani writes: &quot;there were signs of domestic fracture to consider. From the beginning, Stevens, who had not shared a bedroom with his wife for years now, moved into the master bedroom with its attached study on the second floor.&quot;

===Career===

After working in several New York law firms between 1904 and 1907, Stevens was hired in January 1908 as a lawyer for the American Bonding Company. By 1914 he had become vice president of the New York office of the Equitable Surety Company of St. Louis, Missouri. When this job was made redundant after a merger in 1916, he joined the home office of Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company and moved to Hartford, where he remained for the rest of his life. 
Stevens&#x27;s career as a businessman-lawyer by day and a poet during his leisure time has received significant attention, as summarized in Thomas Grey&#x27;s &quot;The Wallace Stevens Case&quot;. Grey has summarized parts of the responsibilities of Stevens&#x27;s day-to-day life that involved the evaluation of surety insurance claims as follows: &quot;If Stevens rejected a claim and the company was sued, he would hire a local lawyer to defend the case in the place where it would be tried. Stevens would instruct the outside lawyer through a letter reviewing the facts of the case and setting out the company&#x27;s substantive legal position; he would then step out of the case, delegating all decisions on procedure and litigation strategy.&quot;

In 1917 Stevens and his wife moved to 210 Farmington Avenue, where they remained for the next seven years and where he completed his first book of poems, &quot;Harmonium&quot;. From 1924 to 1932 he resided at 735 Farmington Avenue. In 1932 he purchased a 1920s Colonial at 118 Westerly Terrace, where he resided for the remainder of his life. According to Mariani, Stevens was financially independent as an insurance executive by the mid-1930s, earning &quot;$20,000 a year, equivalent to about $350,000 today [2016]. And this at a time (during The Great Depression) when many Americans were out of work, searching through trash cans for food.&quot; Harriet Monroe, reviewing &quot;Harmonium&quot; for &quot;Poetry&quot;, wrote: &quot;The delight which one breathes like a perfume from the poetry of Wallace Stevens is the natural effluence of his own clear and untroubled and humorously philosophical delight in the beauty of things as they are.&quot; 
By 1934, Stevens had been named vice president of the company. After he won the Pulitzer Prize in 1955, he was offered a faculty position at Harvard but declined since it would have required him to give up his job at The Hartford.

Throughout his life, Stevens was politically conservative. The critic William York Tindall described him as a Republican in the mold of Robert A. Taft.

===Travel===
Stevens made numerous visits to Key West, Florida, between 1922 and 1940, usually staying at the Casa Marina hotel on the Atlantic Ocean. He first visited in January 1922, while on a business trip. &quot;The place is a paradise,&quot; he wrote to Elsie, &quot;midsummer weather, the sky brilliantly clear and intensely blue, the sea blue and green beyond what you have ever seen.&quot; Key West&#x27;s influence on Stevens&#x27;s poetry is evident in many of the poems published in his first two collections, &quot;Harmonium&quot; and &quot;Ideas of Order.&quot; In February 1935, Stevens encountered the poet Robert Frost at the Casa Marina. The two men argued, and Frost reported that Stevens had been drunk and acted inappropriately. According to Mariani, Stevens often visited speakeasies during Prohibition with both lawyer friends and poetry acquaintances.

The following year, Stevens was in an altercation with Ernest Hemingway at a party at the Waddell Avenue home of a mutual acquaintance in Key West. Stevens broke his hand, apparently from hitting Hemingway&#x27;s jaw, and was repeatedly knocked to the street by Hemingway. Stevens later apologized. Mariani relates this:

directly in front of Stevens was the very nemesis of his Imagination—the antipoet poet (Hemingway), the poet of extraordinary reality, as Stevens would later call him, which put him in the same category as that other antipoet, William Carlos Williams, except that Hemingway was fifteen years younger and much faster than Williams, and far less friendly. So it began, with Stevens swinging at the bespectacled Hemingway, who seemed to weave like a shark, and Papa hitting him one-two and Stevens going down &quot;spectacularly,&quot; as Hemingway would remember it, into a puddle of fresh rainwater.

In 1940, Stevens made his final trip to Key West. Frost was at the Casa Marina again, and again the two men argued. According to Mariani, the exchange in Key West in February 1940 included the following comments:

===Post-war poetry===
By late February 1947, with Stevens approaching 67 years of age, it became apparent that he had completed the most productive ten years of his life in writing poetry. February 1947 saw the publication of his volume of poems &quot;Transport to Summer&quot;, which was positively received by F. O. Mathiessen in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In the 11 years immediately preceding its publication, Stevens had written three volumes of poems: &quot;Ideas of Order&quot;, &quot;The Man with the Blue Guitar&quot;, &quot;Parts of a World&quot;, and &quot;Transport to Summer&quot;. These were all written before Stevens took up the writing of his well-received &quot;The Auroras of Autumn&quot;.

In 1950–51, when Stevens received news that Santayana had retired to live at a retirement institution in Rome for his final years, Stevens composed his poem &quot;To an Old Philosopher in Rome&quot;: 
===Last illness and death===
According to Mariani, Stevens had a large, corpulent figure throughout most of his life, standing tall and weighing as much as . Some of his doctors put him on medical diets. On March 28, 1955, Stevens went to see Dr. James Moher for accumulating detriments to his health. Moher&#x27;s examination did not reveal anything, and he ordered Stevens to undergo an x-ray and barium enema on April 1, neither of which showed anything. On April 19 Stevens underwent a G.I. series that revealed diverticulitis, a gallstone, and a severely bloated stomach. Stevens was admitted to St. Francis Hospital and on April 26 was operated on by Dr. Benedict Landry.

It was determined that Stevens was suffering from stomach cancer in the lower region by the large intestines and blocking the normal digestion of food. Lower tract oncology of a malignant nature was almost always a mortal diagnosis in the 1950s. This was withheld from Stevens, but his daughter Holly was fully informed and advised not to tell her father. Stevens was released in a temporarily improved ambulatory condition on May 11 and returned to his home to recuperate. His wife insisted on trying to attend to him as he recovered but she had suffered a stroke in the previous winter and was not able to assist as she had hoped. Stevens entered the Avery Convalescent Hospital on May 20.

By early June he was still sufficiently stable to attend a ceremony at the University of Hartford to receive an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree. On June 13 he traveled to New Haven to collect an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Yale University. On June 20 he returned to his home and insisted on working for limited hours. On July 21 Stevens was readmitted to St. Francis Hospital and his condition deteriorated. On August 1, though bedridden, he revived sufficiently to speak some parting words to his daughter before falling asleep after normal visiting hours were over; he was found deceased the next morning, August 2, at 8:30. He is buried in Hartford&#x27;s Cedar Hill Cemetery.

Mariani indicates that friends of Stevens were aware that throughout his years and many visits to New York City, Stevens was in the habit of visiting St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral for meditative purposes. Stevens debated questions of theodicy during his final weeks with Fr. Arthur Hanley, chaplain of St. Francis Hospital in Hartford, where Stevens spent his last days suffering from stomach cancer and was eventually converted to Catholicism in April 1955 by Hanley. This purported deathbed conversion is disputed, particularly by Stevens&#x27;s daughter, Holly, who was not present at the time of the conversion, according to Hanley. The conversion has been confirmed by both Hanley and a nun present at the time of the conversion and communion. He had a long correspondence with Catholic nun, literary critic and poet M. Bernetta Quinn, whose work he loved and with whom he was close. Stevens&#x27;s obituary in the local newspaper was minimal at the family&#x27;s request as to the details of his death. The obituary for Stevens that appeared in &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine was assigned to William Carlos Williams, who felt it suitable to compare Stevens&#x27;s poetry to Dante&#x27;s &quot;Vita Nuova&quot; and Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. At the end of his life, Stevens had left uncompleted his larger ambition to rewrite Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; for those who &quot;live in the world of Darwin and not the world of Plato.&quot;

==Reception==
===Early 20th century===
The initial reception of Stevens&#x27;s poetry followed the publication of his first collection of poems, &quot;Harmonium&quot;, in the early 1920s. Comments on the poems were made by fellow poets and a small number of critics including William Carlos Williams and Hi Simons. In her book on Stevens&#x27;s poetry, Helen Vendler writes that much of the early reception of his poems was oriented to symbolic reading of them, often using simple substitution of metaphors and imagery for their asserted equivalents in meaning. For Vendler, this method of reception and interpretation was often limited in its usefulness and would eventually be replaced by more effective forms of literary evaluation and review.

===Late 20th century===
After Stevens&#x27;s death in 1955, the literary interpretation of his poetry and critical essays began to flourish with full-length books written about his poems by such prominent literary scholars as Vendler and Harold Bloom. Vendler&#x27;s two books on Stevens&#x27;s poetry distinguished his short poems and his long poems and suggested that they be considered under separate forms of literary interpretation and critique. Her studies of the longer poems are in her book &quot;On Extended Wings&quot; and lists Stevens&#x27;s longer poems as including &quot;The Comedian as the Letter C&quot;, &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, &quot;Le Monocle de Mon Oncle&quot;, &quot;Like Decorations in a Nigger Cemetery&quot;, &quot;Owl&#x27;s Clover&quot;, &quot;The Man with the Blue Guitar&quot;, &quot;Examination of the Hero in a Time of War&quot;, &quot;Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction&quot;, &quot;Esthetique du Mal&quot;, &quot;Description without Place&quot;, &quot;Credences of Summer&quot;, &quot;The Auroras of Autumn&quot;, and his last and longest poem, &quot;An Ordinary Evening in New Haven&quot;. Another full-length study of Stevens&#x27;s poetry in the late 20th century is Daniel Fuchs&#x27;s &quot;The Comic Spirit of Wallace Stevens&quot;.

===Early 21st century===
Interest in the reading and reception of Stevens&#x27;s poetry continues into the early 21st century, with a full volume dedicated in the Library of America to his collected writings and poetry. In his book on the reading of Stevens as a poet of what he calls &quot;philosophical poetry&quot;, Charles Altieri presents his own reading of such philosophers as Hegel and Wittgenstein while presenting a speculative interpretation of Stevens under this approach. In his 2016 book &quot;Things Merely Are: Philosophy in the Poetry of Wallace Stevens&quot;, Simon Critchley indicates a refinement of the appreciation of the interaction of reality and poetry in Stevens&#x27;s poems, writing: &quot;Steven&#x27;s late poems stubbornly show how the mind cannot seize hold of the ultimate nature of reality that faces it. Reality retreats before the imagination that shapes and orders it. Poetry is therefore the experience of failure. As Stevens puts it in a famous late poem, the poet gives us ideas about the thing, not the thing itself.&quot;

==Interpretation==
The reception and interpretation of Stevens&#x27;s poetry have been widespread and of diverse orientation. In their book &quot;The Fluent Mundo&quot; Leonard and Wharton define at least four schools of interpretation, beginning with the prime advocates of Stevens found in the critics Harvey Pearce and Helen Regeuiro, who supported the thesis &quot;that Stevens&#x27;s later poetry denies the value of imagination for the sake of an unobstructed view of the &#x27;things themselves&#x27;&quot;. The next school of interpretation Leonard and Wharton identify is the Romantic school, led by Vendler, Bloom, James Baird, and Joseph Riddel. A third school of Stevens interpretation that sees Stevens as heavily dependent on 20th-century Continental philosophy includes J. Hillis Miller, Thomas J. Hines, and Richard Macksey. A fourth school sees Stevens as fully Husserlian or Heideggerian in approach and tone and is led by Hines, Macksey, Simon Critchley, Glauco Cambon, and Paul Bove. These four schools offer occasional agreement and disagreement of perspective; for example, Critchley reads Bloom&#x27;s interpretation of Stevens as in the anti-realist school while seeing Stevens as not in the anti-realist school of poetic interpretation.

===Maturity of poetry===
Stevens is a rare example of a poet whose main output came largely only as he approached 40 years of age. His first major publication (four poems from a sequence titled &quot;Phases&quot; in the November 1914 edition of &quot;Poetry&quot;) was written at age 35, although as an undergraduate at Harvard, Stevens had written poetry and exchanged sonnets with Santayana. Many of his canonical works were written well after he turned 50. According to Bloom, who called Stevens the &quot;best and most representative&quot; American poet of the time, no Western writer since Sophocles has had such a late flowering of artistic genius. His contemporary Harriet Monroe called Stevens &quot;a poet, rich and numerous and profound, provocative of joy, creative beauty in those who can respond to him&quot;. Vendler notes that there are three distinguishable moods present in Stevens&#x27;s long poems: ecstasy, apathy, and reluctance between ecstasy and apathy. She also notes that his poetry was highly influenced by the paintings of Paul Klee and Paul Cézanne:

Stevens saw in the paintings of both Paul Klee—who was his favorite painter—and Cézanne the kind of work he wanted to do himself as a Modernist poet. Klee had imagined symbols. Klee is not a directly realistic painter and is full of whimsical and fanciful and imaginative and humorous projections of reality in his paintings. The paintings are often enigmatic or full of riddles, and Stevens liked that as well. What Stevens liked in Cézanne was the reduction, you might say, of the world to a few monumental objects.

Stevens&#x27;s first book of poetry, &quot;Harmonium&quot;, was published in 1923, and republished in a second edition in 1930. Two more books of his poetry were produced during the 1920s and 1930s and three more in the 1940s. He received the annual National Book Award for Poetry twice, in 1951 for &quot;The Auroras of Autumn&quot; and in 1955 for &quot;Collected Poems&quot;.

===Imagination and reality===
For Thomas Grey, a Stevens biographer specializing in attention to Stevens as a businessman lawyer, Stevens in part related his poetry to his imaginative capacities as a poet while assigning his lawyer&#x27;s duties more to the reality of making ends meet in his personal life. Grey finds the poem &quot;A Rabbit as King of the Ghosts&quot; useful to understanding the approach Stevens took in separating his poetry and his profession, writing: &quot;The law and its prose were separate from poetry, and supplied a form of relief for Stevens by way of contrast with poetry, as the milkman (portrayed as the realist in the poem) relieves from the moonlight, as the walk around the block relieves the writer&#x27;s trance like absorption. But the priority was clear: imagination, poetry, and secrecy, pursued after hours were primary, good in themselves; reason, prose, and clarity, indulged in during working hours, were secondary and instrumental&quot;.

In the &quot;Southern Review&quot;, Hi Simons wrote that much of early Stevens is juvenile romantic subjectivist, before he became a realist and naturalist in his more mature and more widely recognized idiom of later years. Stevens, whose work became meditative and philosophical, became very much a poet of ideas. &quot;The poem must resist the intelligence / Almost successfully&quot;, he wrote. Of the relation between consciousness and the world, in Stevens&#x27;s work &quot;imagination&quot; is not equivalent to consciousness, nor is &quot;reality&quot; equivalent to the world as it exists outside our minds. Reality is the product of the imagination as it shapes the world. Because it is constantly changing as we attempt to find imaginatively satisfying ways to perceive the world; reality is an activity, not a static object. We approach reality with a piecemeal understanding, putting together parts of the world in an attempt to make it seem coherent. To make sense of the world is to construct a worldview through an active exercise of the imagination. This is no dry, philosophical activity, but a passionate engagement in finding order and meaning. Thus Stevens wrote in &quot;The Idea of Order at Key West&quot;:

In &quot;Opus Posthumous&quot;, Stevens writes, &quot;After one has abandoned a belief in God, poetry is that essence which takes its place as life&#x27;s redemption.&quot; But as the poet attempts to find a fiction to replace the lost gods, he immediately encounters a problem: a direct knowledge of reality is not possible.

Stevens suggests that we live in the tension between the shapes we take as the world acts upon us and the ideas of order that our imagination imposes upon the world. The world influences us in our most normal activities: &quot;The dress of a woman of Lhassa, / In its place, / Is an invisible element of that place / Made visible.&quot; As Stevens says in his essay &quot;Imagination as Value&quot;, &quot;The truth seems to be that we live in concepts of the imagination before the reason has established them.&quot;

===Supreme Fiction===
&quot;Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction&quot; is a lyrical poetic work of three parts, containing 10 poems each, with a preface and epilogue opening and closing the entire work of three parts. It was first published in 1942 and represents a comprehensive attempt by Stevens to state his view of the art of writing poetry. Stevens studied the art of poetic expression in many of his writings and poems, including &quot;The Necessary Angel&quot;, where he wrote, &quot;The imagination loses vitality as it ceases to adhere to what is real. When it adheres to the unreal and intensifies what is unreal, while its first effect may be extraordinary, that effect is the maximum effect that it will ever have.&quot;

Throughout his poetic career, Stevens was concerned with the question of what to think about the world now that notions of religion no longer suffice. His solution might be summarized by the notion of a &quot;Supreme Fiction&quot;, an idea that would serve to correct and improve old notions of religion along with old notions of the idea of God of which Stevens was critical. In this example from the satirical &quot;A High-Toned Old Christian Woman&quot;, Stevens plays with the notions of immediately accessible, but ultimately unsatisfying, notions of reality:

The saxophones squiggle because, as J. Hillis Miller says of Stevens in his book &quot;Poets of Reality&quot;, the theme of universal fluctuation is a constant theme throughout Stevens&#x27;s poetry: &quot;A great many of Stevens&#x27;s poems show an object or group of objects in aimless oscillation or circling movement.&quot; In the end, reality remains.

The supreme fiction is that conceptualization of reality that seems to resonate in its rightness, so much so that it seems to have captured, if only for a moment, something actual and real.

In one of his last poems, &quot;Final Soliloquy of the Interior Paramour&quot;, Stevens describes the experience of an idea that satisfies the imagination and writes, &quot;The world imagined is the ultimate good.&quot; Stevens places this thought in the individual human mind and writes of its compatibility with his own poetic interpretation of God, writing: &quot;Within its vital boundary, in the mind,/ We say God and the imagination are one .../ How high that highest candle lights the dark.&quot;

===Poetic criticism of old religion===

Imaginative knowledge of the type described in &quot;Final Soliloquy&quot; necessarily exists within the mind, since it is an aspect of the imagination that can never attain a direct experience of reality.

Stevens concludes that God and human imagination are closely identified, but that feeling of rightness which for so long a time existed with that old religious idea of God may be accessed again. This supreme fiction will be something equally central to our being, but contemporary to our lives, in a way that the old religious idea of God can never again be. But with the right idea, we may again find the same sort of solace that we once found in old religious ideas. &quot;[Stevens] finds, too, a definite value in the complete contact with reality. Only, in fact, by this stark knowledge can he attain his own spiritual self that can resist the disintegrating forces of life ... Powerful force though the mind is ... it cannot find the absolutes. Heaven lies about the seeing man in his sensuous apprehension of the world ...; everything about him is part of the truth.&quot;

In this way, Stevens&#x27;s poems adopt attitudes that are corollaries to those earlier spiritual longings that persist in the unconscious currents of the imagination. &quot;The poem refreshes life so that we share, / For a moment, the first idea ... It satisfies / Belief in an immaculate beginning / And sends us, winged by an unconscious will, / To an immaculate end.&quot; The &quot;first idea&quot; is that essential reality that stands before all others, that essential truth; but since all knowledge is contingent on its time and place, that supreme fiction will surely be transitory. This is the necessary angel of subjective reality—a reality that must always be qualified—and as such, always misses the mark to some degree—always contains elements of unreality.

Miller summarizes Stevens&#x27;s position:

Though this dissolving of the self is in one way the end of everything, in another way it is the happy liberation. There are only two entities left now that the gods are dead: man and nature, subject and object. Nature is the physical world, visible, audible, tangible, present to all the senses, and man is consciousness, the nothing which receives nature and transforms it into something unreal ...

===Influence of Nietzsche===
Aspects of Stevens&#x27;s thought and poetry draw from the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche. Stevens&#x27;s poem &quot;Description without Place,&quot; for example, directly mentions the philosopher:

Scholars have attempted to trace some of Nietzsche&#x27;s influence on Stevens&#x27;s thought. While Stevens&#x27;s intellectual relationship to Nietzsche&#x27;s is complex, it is clear that he shared Nietzsche&#x27;s perspective on topics such as religion, change, and the individual. Milton J. Bates writes:

in a 1948 letter to Rodriguez Feo, [Stevens] expressed his autumnal mood with an allusion to Nietzsche: &quot;How this oozing away hurts notwithstanding the pumpkins and the glaciale of frost and the onslaught of books and pictures and music and people. It is finished, Zarathustra says; and one goes to the Canoe Club and has a couple of Martinis and a pork chop and looks down the spaces of the river and participates in the disintegration, the decomposition, the rapt finale&quot; (&quot;L&quot; 621). Whatever Nietzsche would have thought of the Canoe Club and its cuisine, he would have appreciated the rest of the letter, which excoriates a world in which the weak affect to be strong and the strong keep silence, in which group living has all but eliminated men of character.

===Literary influence===
From the first, critics and fellow poets praised Stevens. Hart Crane wrote to a friend in 1919, after reading some of the poems that would make up &quot;Harmonium,&quot; &quot;There is a man whose work makes most of the rest of us quail.&quot; The Poetry Foundation states that &quot;by the early 1950s Stevens was regarded as one of America&#x27;s greatest contemporary poets, an artist whose precise abstractions exerted substantial influence on other writers.&quot; Some critics, like Randall Jarrell and Yvor Winters, praised Stevens&#x27;s early work but were critical of his more abstract and philosophical later poems.

Harold Bloom, Helen Vendler, and Frank Kermode are among the critics who have cemented Stevens&#x27;s position in the canon as one of the key figures of 20th-century American Modernist poetry. Bloom has called Stevens &quot;a vital part of the American mythology&quot; and unlike Winters and Jarrell, Bloom has cited Stevens&#x27;s later poems, like &quot;Poems of our Climate,&quot; as among his best.

In commenting on the place of Stevens among contemporary poets and previous poets, his biographer Paul Mariani stated, &quot;Stevens&#x27;s real circle of philosopher-poets included Pound and Eliot as well as Milton and the great romantics. By extension, E. E. Cummings was a mere shadow of a poet, while Blackmur (a contemporary critic and publisher) did not even deign to mention Williams, Moore, or Hart Crane.&quot;

===Racism===

There is various evidence of Stevens&#x27;s contempt for people of African descent, e.g., his use of the phrase &quot;nigger mystics&quot; in his poem &quot;Prelude to Objects&quot;, and the title of his poem &quot;Like Decorations in a Nigger Cemetery&quot;. This attitude is further illustrated by the following anecdote: &quot;It happened during the meeting of the National Book Award committee that gave the poetry prize to Marianne Moore. [F]ive [judges, including] Wallace Stevens ... passed the time looking at photographs of previous meetings of National Book Award judges. Gwendolyn Brooks appeared in one of these. On seeing the photo, Stevens remarked, &#x27;Who&#x27;s the coon?&#x27; ... Noticing the reaction of the group to his question, he asked, &#x27;I know you don&#x27;t like to hear people call a lady a coon, but who is it?&#x27;”

==In popular culture==
In 1976, after discovering Picasso&#x27;s etching techniques from Atelier Crommelynck, David Hockney produced a suite of 20 etchings called &quot;The Blue Guitar&quot;. The frontispiece mentions Hockney&#x27;s dual inspiration as &quot;The Blue Guitar: Etchings By David Hockney Who Was Inspired By Wallace Stevens Who Was Inspired By Pablo Picasso&quot;. The etchings refer to themes of a poem by Stevens, &quot;The Man with the Blue Guitar&quot;. Petersburg Press published the portfolio in October 1977. The same year, Petersburg also published a book in which the poem&#x27;s text accompanied the images.

Both titles of an early story by John Crowley, first published in 1978 as &quot;Where Spirits Gat Them Home&quot;, later collected in 1993 as &quot;Her Bounty to the Dead&quot;, come from &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;. The titles of two novels by D. E. Tingle, &quot;Imperishable Bliss&quot; (2009) and &quot;A Chant of Paradise&quot; (2014), come from &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;. John Irving quotes Stevens&#x27;s poem &quot;The Plot Against the Giant&quot; in his novel &quot;The Hotel New Hampshire&quot;. In Terrence Malick&#x27;s film &quot;Badlands&quot;, the nicknames of the protagonists are Red and Kit, a possible reference to Stevens&#x27;s poem &quot;Red Loves Kit&quot;.

Nick Cave cited the lines &quot;And the waves, the waves were soldiers moving&quot; in his song &quot;We Call Upon the Author&quot;. They come from Stevens&#x27;s poem &quot;Dry Loaf&quot;. Later Vic Chesnutt recorded a song named &quot;Wallace Stevens&quot; on his album &quot;North Star Deserter&quot;. The song references Stevens&#x27;s poem &quot;Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird&quot;.

Stevens was honored with a US postage stamp in 2012.

<text>Byfield National Park is a national park in the Shire of Livingstone, Queensland, Australia.

== Geography ==

The park is 70 km north-east of Rockhampton. The parks encloses 12 km of coastline including four beaches.

To the north of the national park is Shoalwater Bay and Byfield State Forest is located to the west of Byfield National Park.

The park contains a number of four-wheel drive tracks and camping areas.

The average elevation of the terrain in the park is 48 metres.

== Climate ==
The park demarcates the southern boundary of a tropical savannah climate (Köppen: &quot;Aw&quot;), although the subtropics are almost a degree to the south.
==Flora and fauna==
The park is home to &quot;Pandanus tectorius&quot;, a plant useful against coastal erosion and provides important habitat for many insects and animals. Rangers are fighting a destructive pest known as the pandanus planthopper in the park, using various means including the use of a native wasp called &quot;Aphanomerus pusillus&quot;.

Waterpark Creek, a creek which flows through the park, contains a population of &quot;Rhadinocentrus ornatus&quot;, a small freshwater fish species.

<text>Camooweal Caves is a national park in Queensland, Australia, 15 km southeast of Camooweal and 1720 km northwest of Brisbane.

The traditional name of this place is Wiliyan-ngurru National Park. The average elevation of the terrain is 242 metres.

==Description==
The national park consists of 13,800 hectares of eucalypt woodland, spinifex, wattle and Mitchell grass. Accessible to the public are two sinkholes that formed over 500 million years by water seepage through beds of dolomite. A picnic table is provided at Nowranie waterhole. Various bird species can be found here, including waterbirds and woodland species.

== History ==
The wider Camooweal area was inhabited by the Indjalandji-Dhidhanu People for thousands of years before the arrival of the Europeans in 1860s. The aboriginal people utilised the park area and the Georgina River for trade with their tribal neighbours. Till date, the Indjalandji-Dhidhanu People believe that the route is traversed by Dreamings, the routes covered by ancestral spirits who shaped the landscape. The Dreamings have created various sites of significance to the Indjalandji-Dhidhanu People in the park.

<text>Cania Gorge is a national park in the North Burnett Region, Queensland, Australia, in the locality of Cania.

== Geography ==

The park is 373 km northwest of Brisbane. The nearest town is Monto. Three Moon Creek is the name of the waterway that runs along the length of the gorge.

The park&#x27;s most dominant features are the 70 m sandstone cliffs. Wildlife native to the park include rock wallabys, bettong, platypus, geckos and over 90 bird species. The flora is diverse, with more than 150 species found in the region, including cypress pine woodland, eucalypt woodland, brigalow forest, dry rainforest and grassland.

Aboriginal rock art on the cliff walls is an indication of indigenous settlement of at least 19,000 years.

A picnic area is located alongside the main road into the park, 8 km from the Burnett Highway. Facilities here include covered picnic tables, toilets and gas-powered barbecues. The majority of the park&#x27;s walking tracks lead from this picnic area, including the 1.1 km trail to Dripping Rock, 1.6 km trail to The Overhang, and the 1.3 km trail to Bloodwood Cave. The longest track in the park leads from a small car park 500 metres south of the picnic area. This 5.6 km circuit takes in Giants Chair Lookout, with views across the gorge; and Fern Tree Pool, a permanent waterhole. Only walkers with moderate levels of fitness should attempt this track. Another walk leads visitors to a former mine site.

<doc id="103224" wikidata="Q1034249" url="?curid=103224" title="Cape Upstart National Park">
<text>Cape Upstart is a national park in the locality of Guthalungra in the Whitsunday Region local government area of North Queensland, Australia, 1,016 km northwest of Brisbane.

The &quot;Juru&quot; Clan of the &quot;Birri-Gubba&quot; Tribal Group lived on Cape Upstart for thousands of years.

== Cultural Importance of Cape Upstart ==

There are numerous middens in the sand dunes of Cape Upstart to demonstrate the connection of the &quot;Juru&quot; People to Cape Upstart. There are also several sacred sites, like the women&#x27;s area at Worrungu Bay, and the stone arrangements near Mine Island, which the senior elder always stated were never &#x27;fish traps&#x27; but an important ceremonial ground used for initiation. The ceremonial ground laid out the paths taken by &quot;Gubulla Munda&quot; (the Carpet Snake) when creating the land and islands inhabited by the Juru people and the paths followed by &quot;Gubulla Munda&quot; (the totem of the &quot;Juru&quot; Clan) in the &quot;Gubulla Munda Dreaming&quot; (the creation story of the &quot;Juru&quot; and &quot;Birri-Gubba&quot; People).

Cape Upstart was named by Lieutenant James Cook on 5 June 1770 during his voyage along the eastern coast of Australia in HM Bark Endeavour.

Europeans, mostly from the nearby Burdekin farming community, began - in the early twentieth century - building semi-permanent huts on the Cape&#x27;s western foreshores. By the start of the twenty-first century these had mostly been replaced by permanent structures used mostly for recreational purposes, a small permanent population having also taken up residency by then.

== Native Title ==

In 2011 Justice Rares of the Federal Court of Australia recognised that the &quot;Juru&quot; People retained Native Title over Cape Upstart National Park. This decision was the culmination of a twenty-year struggle by the &quot;Juru&quot; People to get their Native Title recognised over Cape Upstart National Park. The Process was originally started by Peter Prior (Gulumba) in 1992 and was completed by his daughter, Renarta Prior (Gootha) in 2012.

<text>Capricornia Cays is both a national park and a scientific national park in Queensland (Australia), located 486 km and 472 km north of the state capital Brisbane respectively. Collectively they comprise 241 ha of coral cays.

Popular recreational activities in the park includes bird, whale and turtle watching as well as camping, walking, swimming, boating, snorkelling and diving. Capricornia Cays National Park is noted for its biological diversity, beauty and for provided habitat for a number of endangered plants and animals. In particular the cays are recognised as having the largest breeding population of endangered loggerhead turtles in the South Pacific.

Access to the islands via boat is available from Gladstone, Bundaberg and 1770.

==Birds==
The cays form an Important Bird Area because they support more than 1% of the world populations of black noddies (with up to 300,000 nests) and wedge-tailed shearwaters (up to 560,000 nests), making up the majority of the east Australian breeding populations of these species, and sometimes more than 1% of the world population of brown boobies (1000-4000 nests).

Seasonal closures in some areas is imposed to protect breeding seabirds.

==Molluscs==
233 mollusc species have been recorded from the islands.

==The cays==
Capricornia Cays National Park protects eight vegetated coral cays in the Capricorn and Bunker group of islands of the southern Great Barrier Reef:
* Erskine Island
* Heron Island (eastern half)
* Lady Musgrave Island – Open for visiting, capable of 40 campers.
* Masthead Island – Open for visiting, capable of 60 campers; however, this is limited to 30 from October to March each year to allow a less disrupted egg-laying ground for turtles.
* North West Island – Open for visiting, capable of 150 campers.
* Tryon Island – Currently closed to public access due to a tree infection, the island has the capacity for 30 campers.
* Wilson Island
The cays are completely built by corals. The area is also of significance as a fishery, particularly for king prawns These eight islands are part of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area and all surrounded by reefs. Vegetation on the cays is dominated by the flowering tree species, &quot;Pisonia grandis&quot;.

A further six cays form Capricornia Cays National Park (Scientific):
* One Tree Island
* Wreck Island
* Fairfax Islands, (East Fairfax &amp; West Fairfax)
* Hoskyn Islands (East and West Hoskyn islands)
There is no public access to these cays.

<doc id="103228" wikidata="Q93848" url="?curid=103228" title="Ngalba Bulal National Park">
<text>Ngalba Bulal is a national park in the Shire of Cook, Queensland, Australia. In 2015, Cedar Bay National Park became the Mangkalba (Cedar Bay) section of the Ngalba Bulal National Park.

== Geography ==
The park is northwest of Brisbane, south of Cooktown and accessible only by boat or foot. The park is one of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area series of national parks, and is a gazetted World Heritage Site. It is also known as Mangkal-Mangkalba in the dialect of the local Aboriginal population, the Eastern Kuku Yalanji.

==History==
The Cedar Bay area was developed in the 1870s for tin mining, and the remains of the tin work can still be seen in the area of Black Snake Rocks.

Cedar Bay gained a degree of notoriety in the 1970s when the Bjelke-Petersen government destroyed a hippie commune that had been present there since July 1972, when it was started by people who had unsuccessfully tried to set one up in Kuranda. The raid was controversial because of the immense cost ($50,000) and use of a helicopter, light aircraft and a Navy vessel to arrest 12 people on drug and vagrancy charges. At the Cedar Bay inquiry, police were accused of burning huts, smashing personal belongings, destroying clothing, chopping down fruit plantations and, ironically, consuming alcohol at the site following the drug raid. Police, in their defence, tendered evidence of squalid living conditions and described the commune’s inhabitants as &quot;filthy, criminal hippies&quot;. Andrew Olle&#x27;s report on this incident for the ABC current affairs show &quot;This Day Tonight&quot; won the award for &quot;Outstanding Contribution to TV Journalism&quot; at the Logie Awards of 1977.

In 2007, the Cedar Bay National Park was part of the of land handed over to Cape York&#x27;s Aboriginal population by the Queensland government. The handover came as a result of a 1994 native title claim.

Cedar Bay National Park was known as Mount Finnigan National Park before being enlarged.

==Activities==
The park contains some of the northernmost tropical rainforests in Australia. Birdwatching is a popular activity with the most common birds including cassowaries, yellow-breasted sunbirds, double-eyed fig-parrots, mangrove kingfishers, beach stone-curlews and pied imperial-pigeons. Bush camping is permitted in the park, however fishing and collecting are prohibited. The sole walking track in the park was a former donkey track used by tin miners. It is inaccessible to all but fit walkers.

<text>Coalstoun Lakes is a national park in Queensland, Australia, northwest of Brisbane. It features a volcano, Mount Le Brun, which has two craters that contain intermittent crater lakes. Mount Le Brun is one of the youngest volcanic formations in Australia, although it was formed more than 600,000 years ago. Coalstoun Lakes is Queensland&#x27;s smallest national park. 

The average elevation of the terrain is .

The lakes were named by local pioneer, Nugent Wade Brown, in 1894. There are various theories as to the origin of the name.

* One is that &quot;Coalstoun&quot; is the corruption of an Aboriginal word &quot;Goanalganai&quot;.
* Another theory is that the name &#x27;Coalstoun&#x27; is a corruption of the word &#x27;Colstoun&#x27;. Nugent Wade Brown&#x27;s father, John Brown (1787–1860), emigrated to the Colony of New South Wales and established a property named Colstoun near what is now Gresford in the Hunter Valley in 1838.
* Colstoun was the ancestral home of the Brown family in Scotland. Colstoun is located south of Edinburgh and remains in the Brown family. According to Queensland Department of National Parks, Sport and Racing &quot;The lakes were named after Coalstoun in Scotland by Wade Brun, manager of nearby Ban Ban Station.&quot; There is no doubt that Nugent Wade Brown and Wade Brun were the same person. His wife, Margaret Campbell-Antill, was an aunt of Major-General John Macquarie Antill .

<text>Conondale National Park is 130 km north of Brisbane in the Sunshine Coast Hinterland near the town of Conondale in the south east Queensland bioregion. The park covers an area of 35,648 hectares protecting large areas of subtropical rainforest, woodlands, wet and dry sclerophyll forest including Queensland&#x27;s tallest tree. The park contains areas of regenerating forest which have been previously logged; areas of forest plantations also border the park. The park is currently managed by the Queensland Government under the Nature Conservation Act 1992.

Since the 1860s the Conondale region has been impacted by land clearing for agriculture, mining and logging, today the park is a refuge for many species now rare and threatened. Threatened species such as the plumed frogmouth, giant barred frog, Conondale crayfish, spotted-tailed quoll, Gympie nut and richmond birdwing butterfly have been recorded in the park and are currently targeted for conservation management to mitigate threats to their survival. Species of interest include the southern gastric brooding frog which mysteriously disappeared in 1981 and is presumed extinct.

== Regional description ==

The landscape has a rugged topography with gorges, valleys and a number of mountains above 700 m with the highest peak being Mount Langley at 868m. Throughout the park there are scenic waterfalls such as Booloumba Creek Falls, cascades and numerous boulder strewn creeks. The Conondale range forms a catchment divide between the Brisbane River and Mary River with the southernmost tributaries of the Mary river forming in Booloumba and Yabba creek. The park also contains wetlands of national significance. These tributaries are important for the threatened Mary river cod which has declined in these creeks. 

The region has a sub-tropical climate with a mean annual rainfall of 1,500 mm, the majority of rainfall occurs seasonally in summer (December–March) usually with heavy downpours and winters generally cold and dry with occasional frosts. Major vegetation types include a mix of complex notophyll vine forest, sub-tropical rainforest, woodlands, bangalow palm forests, wet sclerophyll and dry sclerophyll forest with rainforest occurring mainly at higher altitudes and along watercourses.
== History ==
The Conondale region served as an important area for both the Jinibara and Kabi Kabi traditional owners, it was an important pathway and resource gathering area for food such as the bunya pine &quot;Araucaria bidwillii&quot; which occurs in the park and remains culturally significant to Indigenous people today. European settlement occurred from 1860 onwards seeing gold mining, farming and logging occur in the region, timber trees logged included red cedar &quot;Toona ciliata&quot;, blackbutt &quot;Eucalyptus pilularis&quot; and tallowood &quot;Eucalyptus microcorys&quot;. By the early 1900s state forests were declared and logging of remnant forests was gradually replaced with the establishment of hoop pine plantations. The national park was established in 1977 after lobbying by conservationists over proposed logging of pristine areas of the Conondale ranges which would have impacted on catchments and endangered species such as the plumed frogmouth, the park now encompasses over 35,000 ha providing opportunities for recreation such as bushwalking, camping, four wheel driving, horse riding and bird watching Many parts of the region have been re-vegetated by private landowners and Landcare groups.

== Ecological significance of Conondale National Park ==

=== Flora ===

Two thirds of the original vegetation in the Conondale region has been cleared including large areas of rainforest leaving a mosaic of cattle pastures, cropland, remnant forests and hoop pine plantations. Extensive areas of remnant forests remain in gullies and steeper parts of the Conondale ranges including large areas of un-managed regrowth. The national park protects significant areas of remnant vegetation including sub-tropical rainforest, wet and dry sclerophyll forest including remnant stands of bunya pine &quot;Araucaria bidwillii&quot;, hoop pine &quot;Araucaria cunninghamii&quot; including extremely tall stands of flooded gum &quot;Eucalyptus grandis&quot; and brush box &quot;Lophostemon confertus&quot;. Queensland&#x27;s tallest tree a &quot;Eucalyptus grandis&quot; was recently discovered in the park in 2013 and stands at 73 metres tall. In total there are thirty one different vegetation types including extensive Palm vine forests, thirteen are listed as ‘of concern’ including gallery rainforests (notophyll vine forests) and semi-evergreen vine thickets which are listed as endangered.

A total of 796 plant species are recorded in the park, twelve species are listed as endangered, vulnerable or near threatened. Notable threatened species include the gympie nut &quot;Macadamia ternifolia&quot; now listed as threatened on the IUCN Red List and listed vulnerable in Queensland and nationally. The brush sophora &quot;Sophora fraseri&quot; and &quot;Bosistoa transversa&quot; are listed nationally as Vulnerable and occurs in semi-evergreen vine thickets, it is threatened by changing fire regimes and competition from weeds.

=== Richmond birdwing butterfly recovery program ===
Conondale National Park is considered a critical site for the survival of the richmond birdwing butterfly &quot;Ornithoptera richmondia&quot; which is listed as vulnerable in Queensland, the park also has significant stands of the richmond birdwing vine &quot;Aristolochia praevenosa&quot; a species of critical priority for the butterfly. The vine is crucial in the lifecycle of the butterfly which occurs predominantly in rainforests along waterways, it is a food source for the larval stage of the butterfly&#x27;s lifecycle and is the only plant the female butterfly will lay its eggs on. Threats include the exotic dutchmans pipe &quot;Aristolochia elegans&quot; which the female butterfly is attracted to and will lay her eggs on, however the leaves are fatal to the butterfly larvae. Extensive public education and conservation programs are underway in Queensland with cultivation, planting, control of weeds and ecological monitoring occurring.

=== Birds ===

Conondale National Park is considered an Important Bird Area (IBA) by Birdlife International with 174 bird species recorded in the park, fourteen species are considered endangered or vulnerable. Notable species include the pale-yellow robin &quot;Tregellasia capito&quot;, paradise riflebird &quot;Ptiloris paradiseus&quot;, green catbird &quot;Ailuroedus crassirostris&quot;, regent bowerbird &quot;Sericulus chrysocephalus&quot; and grey goshawk &quot;Accipiter novaehollandiae&quot; Australian logrunner &quot;Orthonyx temminckii&quot;. Threatened birds in the park include the Coxen&#x27;s fig parrot &quot;Cyclopsitta diophthalma coxeni&quot;, red goshawk &quot;Erythrotriorchis radiatus&quot;, glossy black cockatoo (eastern) &quot;Calyptorhynchus lathami lathami&quot; and the powerful owl &quot;Ninox strenua&quot;.

The Conondale ranges provides an important northern refuge for populations of eastern bristlebirds &quot;Dasyornis brachypterus&quot;, a small semi-flightless bird dependent on vegetation cover and sensitive to fire. The bird was once common from Victoria to the Queensland but has declined, the species is now listed as Endangered under the IUCN red list of threatened species and listed nationally and in Queensland as endangered. Park managers are currently identifying and protecting suitable habitat within the national park and implementing the recovery plan for the northern population eastern bristlebirds. The plumed frogmouth &quot;Podargus ocellatus plumiferus&quot; is listed as vulnerable in Queensland and was only discovered in the Conondale ranges in 1976 with the national park considered a stronghold for the species. Its habitat is sub-tropical rainforest at high altitudes and estimates of current population in the Conondale ranges are around 800 pairs with less than 2,000 ha of suitable habitat in the region. Current populations are threatened by land clearing, inappropriate fire regimes and climate change.

The black-breasted button-quail &quot;Turnix melanogaster&quot; is a small ground dwelling bird which inhabits notophyll vine forest or ‘dry rainforests’ with up to 90% of its habitat has been cleared with less than 2,500 individuals estimated remaining in the wild. The species is listed as vulnerable nationally and in Queensland and is considered near threatened on the IUCN red list. The Conondale populations is considered an important population due to the size and location being within a national park.
=== Mammals ===

There have been 68 species of mammals recorded in the park with many being uncommon and range restricted such as the yellow-bellied glider &quot;Petaurus australis&quot;, koala &quot;Phascolarctos cinereus&quot;, grey headed flying-fox &quot;Pteropus poliocephalus&quot;, golden-tipped bat &quot;Kerivoula papuensis&quot;. The rufous bettong &quot;Aepyprymnus rufescens&quot; occurs in the park and is the largest of the potoroos, it feeds at night on roots and fungi occurring in wet and dry sclerophyll forests. Threats include changes to fire regimes, over-grazing and predation by feral animals. The long-nosed potoroo &quot;Potorous tridactylus tridactylus&quot; is recorded in the park and is the smallest member of the kangaroo superfamily, it is listed nationally and in Queensland as vulnerable. Current threats include predation by European foxes and land clearing. The spotted-tail quoll &quot;Dasyurus maculatus maculatus&quot; has been recorded in the park and is mainland Australia&#x27;s largest surviving marsupial and one of three distinct subspecies. The spotted-tail quoll has undergone drastic losses in Queensland with a 50 - 90% reduction in range since European settlement. This is attributed to habitat loss, fragmentation, logging, poison baiting, predators and cane toads, habitat critical to the spotted-tail quoll includes large tracts of undisturbed mature forest.

=== Amphibians ===

Thirty one species of frogs are known to occur in the Conondale ranges including species of scientific interest, the endangered giant barred frog &quot;Mixophyes iteratus&quot; occurs at its northern limit. The endangered fleay&#x27;s barred frog &quot;Mixophyes fleayi&quot; and the vulnerable tusked frog &quot;Adelotus brevis&quot; and cascade treefrog &quot;Litoria pearsoniana&quot; have also been recorded in the park, the threatened stream frog recovery plan is currently being implemented along with monitoring of these threatened species in the park.

The Conondale region has experienced recent rapid declines in frog populations; the southern gastric brooding frog &quot;Rheobatrachus silus&quot; which only became known to science in 1973 and the southern dayfrog &quot;Taudactylus diurnus&quot; declined rapidly between 1979 and 1981 with both presumed extinct. Four other species found in the park have also declined. There have been similar declines and disappearances of frogs in north Queensland and Central America under similar circumstances, the causes of these declines in still unknown but several hypotheses have been developed including the possible impact of chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis which has been reported in the region.

=== Reptiles ===

There are 54 species of reptiles recorded in the park which include the rough-scaled snake &quot;Tropidechis carinatus&quot;, lace monitor &quot;Varanus varius&quot;, land mullet &quot;Bellatorias major&quot;, carpet python &quot;Morelia spilota&quot; and the near threatened challenger skink &quot;Saproscincus rosei&quot; which occurs in rainforest but has also been found to occur in high densities in exotic Lantana camara thickets.

=== Invertebrates ===

The Conondale crayfish &quot;Euastacus urospinosus&quot; only occurs in upland rainforest streams in the Conondale and Blackall Range ranges, one of its strongholds is Conondale National Park. The crayfish burrows in rainforest streams at elevations between 450-550m, the Bundaroo creek system where the crayfish occurs has an absence of historical mining and logging which may account for its continued survival. The species is classified as endangered on IUCN red list with the species being highly range restricted due to climatic intolerances and susceptibility to catastrophic weather events and climate change. Other threats are feral pigs Sus scrofa wallowing and destroying creek bank vegetation and crayfish burrows.

== Environmental threats and conservation management ==

=== Conondale’s disappearing frogs - chytrid fungus ===

The southern gastric brooding was discovered in 1973 in the Conondale ranges, it displayed a unique reproductive mode in which the female would ingest the eggs which then complete their development in the mothers stomach. To survive the tadpoles secreted hormones to inhibit the digestive secretions of the stomach until they are given birth to via the mother&#x27;s mouth. The species occurred in good numbers in high altitude rocky streams but in 1979 the species declined rapidly and disappeared with no sightings since 1981 despite continued efforts to relocate the species. This coincided with the rapid disappearance of the southern dayfrog which occurred at the same location as the southern gastric brooding frog, there have also been no sightings of the southern dayfrog since 1979 and both species are presumed extinct.

There are numerous theories as to why frog species have declined and disappeared, a possible cause is the chytrid fungus &quot;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&quot; which has been attributed to the decline of 14 montane specialist frogs in undisturbed rainforest habitat. Epidemics of the chytrid fungus have also occurred in Eungella National Park in North Queensland around 1985-1986 causing the decline of the Eungella gastric brooding frog &quot;Rheobatrachus vitellinus&quot;. The fungus is highly pathogenic and rapidly causes the decline and death of the host. In the case of the Eungella gastric brooding frog the population was able to persist and recover however the chytrid fungus still persists in the frog population. The federal government has identified the chytrid fungus as a key threatening process for stream frogs in Australia and has subsequently developed a threat abatement plan for the disease.

=== Forestry plantations ===

The national park borders areas of state forest and hoop pine plantations which are subject to on-going harvesting activities, these pose potential environmental threats to black-breasted button-quail which inhabits areas adjacent to the hoop pine plantations. The plumed frogmouth is sensitive to disturbance and has specialised habitat requirements of pristine forests, there are potential impacts from forest harvesting of native timber in the Conondale region. Additional impacts from forestry operations include increased siltation and erosion from disused roads and tracks may impact water quality.
=== Fire management ===

Fire has been identified as having impacts on species within the park, studies of the eastern bristlebird indicates it responds well to planned mosaic burning which allows the bird to move into areas of unburnt habitat after fire. Feral animal baiting after fire is also needed as reduced vegetation cover leaves the birds more susceptible to predation from feral cats and foxes. Species like the black-breasted button-quail and glossy black-cockatoos are also fire sensitive, the &quot;Eucalyptus montivaga&quot; community is reliant on fire for maintenance of a healthy understorey. A fire management strategy has been prepared for Conondale National Park with the &quot;Eucalyptus montivaga&quot; vegetation community currently being studied for its response to fire.

=== Climate change ===

Climate change has been identified as a major threat to flora and fauna around the globe, amphibians have been identified as being particularly susceptible to climate changes. In a recent study identified a number of species in Conondale National Park as vulnerable to climate change which included the fleay&#x27;s barred frog, pouched frog, Australian logrunner, challenger skink and plumed frogmouth. A possible cause of rapid declines in frog species could be attributed to climate change and the increase in UV light especially in high altitude regions. The Conondale crayfish which is sensitive to changes in temperature and may be impacted by future changes to climate temperature, the &quot;Eucalyptus montivaga&quot; vegetation community may also be particularly susceptible to climate change.
=== Management of pest plants and animals ===

A pest management strategy is currently being implemented for plant weed species such as lantana &quot;Lantana camara&quot;, dutchmans pipe, cat&#x27;s claw creeper &quot;Macfadyena unguis-cati&quot; and crofton weed &quot;Ageratina adenophora&quot; which threaten species such as the richmond birdwing butterfly, eastern bristlebird and notophyll vine forests.

A number of feral animals are impacting native species and degrading habitat, feral animals in the park include cats &quot;Felis catus&quot;, foxes &quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot; and wild dogs &quot;Canis familiaris&quot; and pose specific threats to native animal species such as ground dwelling small mammals and birds such as the eastern bristlebird. Feral pigs &quot;Sus scrofa&quot; are being managed through on-going trapping, baiting and photo monitoring to reduce threats to species such as eastern bristlebirds, long-nosed potoroos and black-breasted button-quails. Red deer &quot;Cervus elaphus&quot; are also impacting on the habitat of frogs and eastern bristlebirds.

<text>Crows Nest National Park is a national park on the edge of the Darling Downs of southern Queensland, Australia. It is divided into a number of sections which are located in both Crows Nest and Grapetree, 40 km west of Esk in the South East Queensland bioregion. A 236 ha national park was first declared in 1967. The park has been extended south along the Great Dividing Range and now covers . The average elevation of the terrain is 503 metres.

The geology of the area is dominated by domed granite outcrops. The vegetation in the park is mostly open eucalypt forest. Species such as the hoop pine, weeping bottlebrush, river she-oak and swamp mahogany can be found along creek banks. The main watercourse in the park is Crows Nest Creek, a tributary of Cressbrook Creek, itself a tributary of the Brisbane River. About 4% of the park is riverine wetlands.

Crows Nest National Park is known for its rugged landscape, waterfalls, and a sparkling gorge called the &quot;Valley of Diamonds&quot;. This valley is so named because of the mineral, feldspar, which glistens in the sunlight. Popular activities include visiting the lookouts and observing the heath wildflowers, wildlife and birdwatching. A total of 10 rare or threatened species have been identified in Crows Nest National Park. Some of them are on the verge of extinction, such as the brush-tailed rock-wallaby &quot;(Petrogale penicillata)&quot;.

==Facilities==
The park has lookouts, walking tracks and facilities for picnics and camping, for which fees apply.

<doc id="103243" wikidata="Q1144838" url="?curid=103243" title="Currawinya National Park">
<text>Currawinya is a national park near Hungerford in South West Queensland, Australia, 828 km west of Brisbane. Part of the mulga lands bioregion this is an area of dry sandy plain with small trees and shrubs. The Paroo River passes through the park.

==History==
The park contains many Indigenous Australians&#x27; sites of cultural significance, which indicate a long period of Aboriginal occupation and use of the wetlands within the park. The park was previously pastoral land. In 1991, the Government of Queensland purchased two properties, Currawinya and Caiwarro Homestead. Remains of the homestead, machinery and a levee bank still exist today. In 2015, the size of the park doubled after the state government acquired three adjoining properties.
==Environment==
Lakes Numalla and Wyara within the park are listed as Ramsar wetland sites of international importance. Lake Numalla is freshwater while Lake Wyara is saline. These provide significant waterbird habitats at times of drought and for migrating waders which travel across inland Australia. 200 bird species have been recorded in the park. Most of the park lies within the Paroo Floodplain and Currawinya Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance, when conditions are suitable, for large numbers of waterbirds.

A total of 14 threatened species have been identified within the park.

==Bilby enclosure==
A feature of the park is a bilby enclosure surrounded by a predator-exclusion fence. The electrified enclosure was opened in 2001. Captive-bred and rehabilitated bilbies once thrived within the safety of the enclosure. The fence was damaged by flooding in late 2011 and early 2012, allowing feral cats into the area. The cats proved difficult to cull and there was a temporary hold put on placing newly reared bilbies into the enclosure until feral cats are below detectable levels there. As of July 2015 there were 75 bilbies ready to be released into the enclosure, but with at least six cats remaining after around 30 were culled, release was being held back

By December 2021, bilbies from breeding programs elsewhere, such as the Charleville Bilby Experience, were being considered for introduction to the enclosure.

==Facilities==
Fishing, canoeing and swimming are popular recreational activities in the park.

<doc id="103244" wikidata="Q752663" url="?curid=103244" title="Delft University of Technology">
<text>The Delft University of Technology (TU Delft; ) is the oldest and largest Dutch public technical university, located in Delft, The Netherlands. It specializes in engineering, technology, computing, design, and natural sciences.

It is considered one of the leading technical universities in Europe and is consistently ranked as one of the best schools for architecture and engineering in the world. According to the QS World University Rankings it ranked 3rd worldwide for architecture and 13th for Engineering &amp; Technology in 2024. It also ranked 3rd best worldwide for mechanical and aerospace engineering, 3rd for civil and structural engineering, 11th for chemical engineering, and 12th for design.

With eight faculties and multiple research institutes, TU Delft educates around 27,000 students (undergraduate and postgraduate), and employs more than 3,500 doctoral candidates and close to 4,500 teaching, research, support and management staff (including more than 1,300 faculty members of all academic ranks in the Netherlands).

The university was established on 8 January 1842 by King William II as a royal academy, with the primary purpose of training civil servants for work in the Dutch East Indies. The school expanded its research and education curriculum over time, becoming a polytechnic school in 1864 and an institute of technology (making it a full-fledged university) in 1905. It changed its name to Delft University of Technology in 1986.

Dutch Nobel laureates Jacobus Henricus van &#x27;t Hoff, Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, and Simon van der Meer have been associated with TU Delft. TU Delft is a member of several university federations, including the IDEA League, CESAER, UNITECH International, ENHANCE Alliance, LDE, and 4TU.

==History==
===Royal Academy (1842–1864)===

Delft University of Technology was founded on 8 January 1842 by William II of the Netherlands as &quot;Royal Academy for the education of civilian engineers, for serving both nation and industry, and of apprentices for trade&quot;. One of the purposes of the academy was to educate civil servants for the colonies of the Dutch East India Company. The first director of the academy was Antoine Lipkens, constructor of the first Dutch optical telegraph, called simply as Lipkens. Royal Academy had its first building located at Oude Delft 95 in Delft. On 23 May 1863 an Act was passed imposing regulations on technical education in the Netherlands, bringing it under the rules of secondary education.

===Polytechnic School (1864–1905)===
On 20 June 1864, Royal Academy in Delft was disbanded by a Royal Decree, giving a way to a &quot;Polytechnic School of Delft&quot; (). The newly formed school educated engineers of various fields and architects, much needed during the rapid industrialization period in the 19th century.

===Institute of Technology (1905–1986)===
Yet another Act, passed on 22 May 1905, changed the name of the school to &quot;Technical College (Institute) of Delft&quot; (, from 1934 ), emphasizing the academic quality of the education. Polytechnic was granted university rights and was allowed to award academic degrees. The number of students reached 450 around that time. The official opening of the new school was attended by Queen Wilhelmina on 10 July 1905. First dean of the newly established college was ir. J. Kraus, hydraulic engineer. In 1905, the first doctoral degree was awarded. From 1924 until the construction of the new campus in 1966, the ceremonies were held in the Saint Hippolytus Chapel.

Corporate rights were granted to the college on 7 June 1956. Most of the university buildings during that time were located within Delft city centre, with some of the buildings set on the side of the river Schie, in the Wippolder district.

Student organizations grew together with the university. The first to be established on 22 March 1848 is the &quot;Delftsch Studenten Corps&quot; housed in the distinctive &quot;Sociëteit Phoenix&quot; on the Phoenixstraat. This was followed by the &quot;Delftsche Studenten Bond&quot; (est. 30 October 1897) and the &quot;KSV Sanctus Virgilius&quot; (est. 2 March 1898). In 1917, &quot;Proof Garden for Technical Plantation&quot; () was established by Gerrit van Iterson, which today is known as Botanical Garden of TU Delft. In that period, a first female professor, Toos Korvezee, was appointed.

===Delft University of Technology (1986–present)===
After the end of World War II, TU Delft increased its rapid academic expansion. Studium Generale was established at all universities in the Netherlands, including TU Delft, to promote a free and accessible knowledge related to culture, technology, society and science. Because of the increasing number of students, in 1974 the first &quot;Reception Week for First Year Students&quot; (, OWEE) was established, which has become a TU Delft tradition since then.
On 1 September 1986, the Delft Institute of Technology officially changed its name to Delft University of Technology, underlining the quality of the education and research provided by the institution. In the course of further expansion, in 1987 Delft Top Tech institute was established, which provided a professional master education in management for people working in technology-related companies. On 1 September 1997, the 13 faculties of the TU Delft were merged into 9, to improve the management efficiency of the growing university. In the early 1990s, because the vast majority of the students of the university were male, an initiative to increase the number of female students resulted in founding a separate emancipation commission. As a result, &quot;Girls Study Technology&quot; () days were established. In later years the responsibilities of the commission were distributed over multiple institutes.

Since 2006 all buildings of the university are located outside of the historical city center of Delft. The relatively new building of Material Sciences department was sold, later demolished in 2007 to give place for a newly built building of the Haagse Hogeschool. Closer cooperation between TU Delft and Dutch universities of applied sciences resulted in physical transition of some of the institutes from outside to Delft. In September 2009 many institutes of applied sciences from the Hague region as well as Institute of Applied Sciences in Rijswijk, transferred to Delft, close to the location of the university, at the square between Rotterdamseweg and Leeghwaterstraat.

In 2007 the three Dutch technical universities, TU Delft, TU Eindhoven and University of Twente, established a federation, called 3TU.
On 13 May 2008, the building of the Faculty of Architecture was destroyed by fire, presumed caused by a short circuit in a coffee machine due to a ruptured water pipe. Luckily, the architecture library, containing several thousands of books and maps, as well as many architecture models, including chairs by Gerrit Rietveld and Le Corbusier, were saved. The Faculty of Architecture is currently housed in the university&#x27;s former main building.

==Logo==
Through the course of the years the logo of the TU Delft changed a number of times, along with its official name. The current logo is based on the three university colors cyan, black and white. The letter &quot;T&quot; bears a stylized flame on top, referring to the flame that Prometheus brought from Mount Olympus to the people, against the will of Zeus. Because of this, Prometheus is sometimes considered as the first engineer, and is an important symbol for the university. His statue stood in the center of the newly renovated TU Delft campus, Mekelpark, until it was stolen in 2012.

==Campus==
Initially, all of the university buildings were located in the historic city centre of Delft. This changed in the second half of the 20th century with relocations to a separate university neighbourhood. The last university building in the historic centre of Delft was the university library, which was relocated to a new building in 1997. On 12 September 2006, the design of the new university neighbourhood, Mekelpark, was officially approved, giving a green light to the transformation of the area around the Mekelweg (the main road on the university terrain) into a new campus heart. The new park replaced the main access road and redirected car traffic around the campus, making the newly created park a safer place for bicycles and pedestrians.

===Mekelpark===

A new university neighborhood called Mekelpark (its name commemorating TH Delft professor and WW II resistance fighter, Jan Mekel, who was executed by the Nazis on 2 May 1942 in Sachsenhausen) was opened on 5 July 2009. Mekelpark replaced old parking structures, bike lanes and filling stations, constructed between faculty buildings of the university in the late 1950s. Its 832-meter-long promenade eased the commute between faculty buildings. Both sides of the promenade are covered by stone benches, 1547 meters long in total. Some of the university buildings around the Mekelpark deserve certain attention.

====Aula====

TU Delft Aula was designed by Van den Broek en Bakema architecture bureau, founded by two TU Delft alumni Jo van den Broek and Jaap Bakema. It was officially opened on 6 January 1966 by Dutch Prime Minister Jo Cals. 
It is a classical example of a structure built in Brutalist style. TU Delft Aula, which symbolically opens the Mekelpark, houses main university restaurant and store, as well as lecture halls, auditoria, congress center, and administrative offices of the university. All doctoral promotion, honoris causa ceremonies, as well as academic senate meetings take place in the Aula.

====Library====

The TU Delft Library, constructed in 1997, was designed by Delft-based Mecanoo architecture bureau. It is located behind university aula. The roof of the library is covered with grass, which serves as a natural insulation. The structure lifts from the ground on one side allowing to walk to the top of the building. The library is topped by the steel cone, giving its unique shape. All the walls are completely filled with glass. The library won the Dutch &quot;National Steel Prize&quot; in 1998 in the &quot;buildings of steel and hybrid constructions&quot; category. The library is also host of the 4TU.Centre for Research Data, the archive for research data in the technical sciences in the Netherlands.

====Cultural and Sports Center====
The TU Delft Sports and Culture Center, recently renamed X, is located at Mekelweg 10, at the edge of the Mekelpark. It was designed by architect Vera Yanovshtchinsky and opened to TU Delft students and staff in 1995. Since then it has undergone expansions and renovations.

===TU Delft Musea===
Three musea are associated with the university: Science Centre Delft, Mineralogy-geology museum and Beijerinck en Kluyver archive.

Science Centre Delft was opened in September 2010 and is located at Mijnbouwstraat 120 in Delft. Science Center Delft is a successor of Technical Exhibition Center. Technical Exhibition Center was established by a group of TU Delft professors with the aim of presenting the recent advances in technology to a wider audience. Parts of the collection were shown outside of Delft: in the Netherlands and abroad, including Israel and Czech Republic. The collection was permanently hosted in the building of former department of geodesy. The historical collections of Technical Exhibition Center were moved Delft Museum of Technology, located at Ezelsveldlaan, in the buildings of the former department of naval architecture (), next to the city center of Delft. As Delft city council together with TU Delft decided to move the collection close to the university campus (currently the building of the former museum are transformed into lofts), Science Centre Delft shows visitors current TU Delft research projects are available, including Eco Runner and Nuna.

Beijerinck en Kluyver archive hosts a collection of documents, exhibits and memorabilia of two scientists historically connected with the university.

Mineralogy-geology museum is a part of TU Delft Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences and contains around 200,000 geological, mineralogical and crystallographical items divided into numerous sub-collections. The oldest items date back to 1842 when the TU Delft (then Delft Royal Academy) was established.

===Botanical garden===
TU Delft botanical garden dates back to 1917, where &quot;Proof Garden for Technical Plantation&quot; () was established by Gerrit van Iterson Jr., TU Delft graduate and assistant to Martinus Beijerinck. Gerrit van Iterson Jr. was the first director of the garden until 1948. Creation of botanical gardens at TU Delft was partially a result of the increasing needs of systematized development of tropical agriculture in then Dutch colony of Dutch East Indies. Over 7000 different species of plants, including tropical and subtropical plants, herbs, and ornamental plants cover the area of almost 2.5 ha. Furthermore, more than 2000 unique species are preserved in university&#x27;s greenhouses. All facilities of TU Delft botanical garden are open to the public.

===Building 28 ===

Building 28 is the main building of Computer Science on campus. It hosts research groups of Intelligent Systems and Software Technology departments, educational and research labs, student study areas, meeting rooms, and the support staff of Computer Science. 

===Echo (Building 29)===

Along with Delft, UNStudio developed the &#x27;Echo&#x27; building on the TU campus for interfaculty lecture halls and project rooms, student study areas, Computer Science (Cybersecurity section and Sequential Decision Making section) research offices, and meeting rooms. It is an energy-producing building within the campus of Delft which aims at energy conservation to delve into the future. Echo won the prestigious World Prix Versailles (Campuses category) in 2023.

===TU Delft | The Hague===

In September 2016, TU Delft inaugurated a new campus in The Hague. The MSc programme Engineering and Policy Analysis (EPA), which teaches students to operate at the intersection of technology and policy when tackling wicked problems, was relocated to this new site to capitalize on its proximity to government ministries, international bodies, and multinational organizations.

TU Delft operates the 5th floor of the Wijnhaven Building at Turfmarkt 99 in The Hague, with the rest of the building being occupied by Leiden University. Originally the Ministry of the Interior&#x27;s headquarters at Schedeldoekshaven 200, the Wijnhaven Building, named after the historic Wijnhavenkwartier, was converted into Campus The Hague in 2016.

In 2023, TU Delft announced plans to further expand its footprint in The Hague by launching a joint university facility with Leiden University at Spui, set to open in 2025. This new location is expected to accommodate around 600 TU Delft students in the city centre of The Hague.

==Education==
Since 2004, the TU Delft education system is divided into three tiers: the bachelor&#x27;s degree, master&#x27;s degree, and doctorate. The academic year is divided into two semesters: the first semester from September until January and the second semester from the end of January until July. Most of the lectures are available through OpenCourseWare.

===Bachelor-level studies===
, TU Delft offers 16 BSc programmes. TU Delft students obtain their degree after a three-year study. The test project finalizes the BSc studies. All BSc programmes are taught in Dutch, except for Aerospace Engineering, Applied Earth Sciences, Nanobiology, and Computer Science, which are taught entirely in English, and Electrical Engineering which is taught in a mixture of both.

===Master-level studies===
TU Delft offers around 40 MSc programmes. The MSc studies take two years to complete.

TU Delft uses the European Credit Transfer System, where each year MSc students are required to obtain 60 ECTS points. An honours track exists for motivated MSc students, who obtained a mark of 7.5 or higher (in Dutch grading scale) and did not fail any courses. This track, associated with 30 ECTS points, is taken alongside the regular MSc programme and must be related to student&#x27;s regular degree courses or the role of technology in society. The honours track must be completed within the time allowed for the MSc programme.

MSc programmes are also offered through the 3TU federation, Erasmus Mundus programmes, IDEA League joint MSc programs and QuTech Academy.

===Doctoral-level studies===
Doctoral studies at TU Delft are divided into two phases. The first phase, lasting one year, serves as a trial period during which the doctoral candidate must prove capability for performing research on a doctoral level. The candidate must pass the evaluation performed at the end of the year by his/her promoter in order to continue doing research the following three years. The research the candidate performs must be finalized by submitting a doctoral thesis. The thesis is evaluated by a doctoral committee composed of TU Delft professors and external opponents. Once the thesis has been revised and comments have been taken into account, the candidate gives a formal doctoral defense.

In contrast to US graduate school, other duties such as following lectures and giving TAs form only a small portion of the programme.

====Doctoral defense====

The doctoral defense is of ceremonial nature and is held in the senate room. It lasts exactly one hour, during which the doctoral candidate must answer all questions from the committee. Sometimes the candidate is accompanied by one or two paranymphs, who theoretically might help defend a question asked by a committee member. The defense is ended by the pedel, who enters the room and says in Latin &quot;Hora est&quot; (&quot;It is time&quot;), stamping the university staff on the floor. The committee then moves to a separate room to decide whether to grant the candidate a doctorate or not. Then the committee returns to the room where the defense was held, and if the doctorate is granted the promoter presents the laudation praising the new doctor. The entire ceremony is chaired by the rector or a representative.

===Other degree programmes===

TU Delft also offers Professional Doctorate in Engineering.

==Organization==

===Research Institutes===
TU Delft has three officially recognized research institutes: Research Institute for the Built Environment, International Research Centre for Telecommunications-transmission and Radar, and Reactor Institute Delft. In addition to those three institutes, TU Delft hosts numerous smaller research institutes, including the Delft Institute of Microelectronics and Submicron Technology, Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Materials innovation institute, Astrodynamics and Space Missions, Delft University Wind Energy Research Institute,
TU Delft Safety and Security Institute, and the Delft Space Institute, Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics is also an important research institute which connects all engineering departments with respect to research and academia. A complete list of research schools is available on TU Delft website.

===Research schools===
Important part of Dutch university system are research schools. They combine education, training and research for PhD candidates and postdoctoral researchers in a given field. The main goal of the research schools is to coordinate nationwide research programs in a given area. Research schools of TU Delft cooperate with other universities in the Netherlands. Research schools are required to have an accreditation of Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. TU Delft is taking the lead in ten research schools, and participates in nine. The full list of research schools affiliated with TU Delft is available on TU Delft website, see for example TRAIL Research School.

===Media===
During an academic year the TU Delft publishes a weekly magazine: &quot;Delta&quot;, which aims at the student and employee community of the university. The newspaper is predominantly in Dutch, with the last few pages published in English. &quot;TU Delta&quot; is distributed freely in paper form over the campus and is also available for free on the Internet. Articles focus mainly on current university affairs and student life. The weekly agenda including PhD promotions, inaugural lectures, etc. is also published therein.

Also, approximately four times a year, the TU Delft publishes a magazine devoted only to research conducted by the university, called &quot;Delft Outlook&quot;. &quot;Delft Outlook&quot; is published in English, while the same content is published in Dutch in &quot;Delft Integraal&quot; magazine. Both magazines present interviews with TU Delft researchers, university officials. Columns by some university professors are published therein, as well as alumni letters and excerpts from recently published PhD theses.

===Management===

TU Delft is governed by the executive board (), controlled and advised by student council, workers council, board of professors, board of doctorates, assistant staff office, committee for the application of the allocation model, operational committee, advisory council for quality and accreditation, deans of each TU Delft faculty, and directors of TU Delft research centers, research schools and research institutes.

Executive board is chaired academically by the Rector Magnificus. The currently appointed Rector Magnificus, Tim van der Hagen, has held the position since 2018. He replaced Prof. Ir. Karel Ch.A.M. Luyben who was rector for the period 2010 to 2018. Previous Rectors of TU Delft include Prof. K.F. Wakker (1993–1997 and 1998–2002), Prof. J. Blauwendraad (1997–1998) and Prof. J.T. Fokkema (2002–2010). Executive board is accountable to the Supervisory Board, appointed by the Minister of Education, Culture and Science. One of the many tasks of executive board is the approval of management regulations.

Board of professors advises in the matter of academic quality, deciding on the selection of guest lecturers, research fellows as well as revising proposals submitted for royal honors for professors. Board of doctorates appoints supervisors for PhD students, forms promotion committees, determines promotional code, and confers PhD and doctorate Honoris Causa degrees. Committee for the application of the allocation model reports to the executive board regarding allocation model. Further, it controls output data supplied to the executive board. Operational committee is composed of members of the executive board and the s. The committee collaborates on the issues of general importance, related in part to the specific interests of the faculties, and strengthens the unity of the university overall.

==Student life==
Student life at TU Delft is organized around numerous student societies and corporations. They can be generally categorized into professional societies, social societies and sport societies. More than half of TU Delft students belong to an officially recognized society.
There are two student parties at TU Delft: ORAS () and Lijst Bèta (successor of AAG). AAG (Afdeling Actie Groepen) started as an action group of students in the 1960s, willing to have more impact on the quality of education at the then Polytechnic Institute Delft. ORAS became active in the early 1970s as a counterbalance to AAG. After already taking a break from the yearly elections in 2008, AAG did not participate anymore in the elections of 2010 due to disappointing results. In 2011, a new party was established, Lijst Bèta, that got 2 out of the 10 seats in the student counsil. Since then, Lijst Bèta and ORAS compete each year for seats in TU Delft&#x27;s Students Council (). Further, all student organizations of TU Delft are associated with The Council of Student Societies Delft VeRa () and The Society for Study and Student Matters Delft VSSD ().

Apart from bachelor and master student organizations, PhD students of TU Delft have their own organization called Promood (PhD Students Discussion Group Delft) (), which represents TU Delft PhD students at the university. It is also a member of Dutch PhD Students Network ().

Each faculty of TU Delft has its own set of professional student organizations. Numerous societies are present at the university, many of them with rich traditions, customs and history. For example, aerospace engineering department hosts Foundation for Students in Airplane Development, Manufacturing and Management (), while civil engineering department Society for Practical Studies. International professional student organizations are also present at TU Delft, including European Association of Aerospace Students.

Apart from professional student societies, students organize themselves only for the purpose of enriching their social life. Many of the societies have sectarian roots, like a Catholic Wolbodo Student Society, Katholieke Studentenvereniging Sanctus Virgilius Delft, that during the course of the years lost the religious affiliations and accepts students from any denomination. Besides societies which have their roots in religion, there are also general (with no religious bonds) societies. One of these is Sint Jansbrug. These societies accept anyone who studies at the TU Delft or any other higher education facility in the Delft area. Also organization that has its roots in Rover Scout movement Delftsche Zwervers (at the same time the oldest student scouting group in the world) is present or local branch of the European AEGEE.

Student sports are organized around clubs, that focus mostly on single discipline. Those include rowing society D.S.R.V. Laga and rowing club Proteus-Eretes (both with many Olympic medals won by the members of the club) or American football club Delft Dragons.

==Research==
TU Delft researchers developed many new technologies used today, including GLARE, a fibre metal laminate used in Airbus A380 skin and Vision in Product Design design method. Cees Dekker&#x27;s lab at TU Delft demonstrated in 1998 the first transistor made out of single nanotube molecule. The Delta Works plan was, in part, a child of TU Delft graduates, including Johan Ringers and Victor de Blocq van Kuffeler. TU Delft was a precursor of the Open design concept.

In architecture, TU Delft is famous for Traditionalist School in Dutch architecture. TU Delft was a home to many prominent microbiologists including Martinus Beijerinck, who in 1898 discovered viruses while working at TU Delft, and Albert Kluyver, father of comparative microbiology, which resulted in the creation of so-called Delft School of Microbiology.

<doc id="103246" wikidata="Q746727" url="?curid=103246" title="Imagism">
<text>Imagism was a movement in early-20th-century poetry that favored precision of imagery and clear, sharp language. It is considered to be the first organized modernist literary movement in the English language. Imagism has been termed &quot;a succession of creative moments&quot; rather than a continuous or sustained period of development. The French academic René Taupin remarked that &quot;it is more accurate to consider Imagism not as a doctrine, nor even as a poetic school, but as the association of a few poets who were for a certain time in agreement on a small number of important principles&quot;.

The Imagists rejected the sentiment and discursiveness typical of Romantic and Victorian poetry. In contrast to the contemporary Georgian poets, who were generally content to work within that tradition, Imagists called for a return to more Classical values, such as directness of presentation, economy of language, and a willingness to experiment with non-traditional verse forms; Imagists used free verse. A characteristic feature of the form is its attempt to isolate a single image to reveal its essence. This mirrors contemporary developments in &quot;avant-garde&quot; art, especially Cubism. Although these poets isolate objects through the use of what the American poet Ezra Pound called &quot;luminous details&quot;, Pound&#x27;s ideogrammic method of juxtaposing concrete instances to express an abstraction is similar to Cubism&#x27;s manner of synthesizing multiple perspectives into a single image.

Imagist publications appearing between 1914 and 1917 featured works by many of the most prominent modernist figures in poetry and other fields, including Pound, H.D. (Hilda Doolittle), Amy Lowell, Ford Madox Ford, William Carlos Williams, F. S. Flint, and T. E. Hulme. The Imagists were centered in London, with members from Great Britain, Ireland and the United States. Somewhat unusually for the time, a number of women writers were major Imagist figures.

==Pre-Imagism==
The origins of Imagism are to be found in two poems, &quot;Autumn&quot; and &quot;A City Sunset&quot; by T. E. Hulme. These were published in January 1909 by the Poets&#x27; Club in London in a booklet called &quot;For Christmas MDCCCCVIII&quot;. Hulme was a student of mathematics and philosophy; he had been involved in setting up the club in 1908 and was its first secretary. Around the end of 1908, he presented his paper &quot;A Lecture on Modern Poetry&quot; at one of the club&#x27;s meetings. Writing in A. R. Orage&#x27;s magazine &quot;The New Age&quot;, the poet and critic F. S. Flint (a champion of free verse and modern French poetry) was highly critical of the club and its publications.

From the ensuing debate, Hulme and Flint became close friends. In 1909, Hulme left the Poets&#x27; Club and started meeting with Flint and other poets in a new group which Hulme referred to as the &quot;Secession Club&quot;; they met at the Eiffel Tower restaurant in London&#x27;s Soho to discuss plans to reform contemporary poetry through free verse and the &quot;tanka&quot; and haiku and through the removal of all unnecessary verbiage from poems. The interest in Japanese verse forms can be contextualized by the late Victorian and Edwardian revival of Chinoiserie and Japonism as witnessed in the 1890s vogue for William Anderson&#x27;s Japanese prints donated to the British Museum as well as in the influence of woodblock prints on paintings by Monet, Degas and van Gogh. Direct literary models were available from a number of sources, including F. V. Dickins&#x27;s 1866 &quot;Hyak nin is&#x27;shiu, or, Stanzas by a Century of Poets, Being Japanese Lyrical Odes&quot;, the first English-language version of the &quot;Hyakunin Isshū&quot;, a 13th-century anthology of 100 waka, the early 20th-century critical writings and poems of Sadakichi Hartmann, and contemporary French-language translations.

The American poet Ezra Pound was introduced to the group in April 1909 and found their ideas close to his own. In particular, Pound&#x27;s studies of early European vernacular poetry had led him to an admiration of the condensed, direct expression that he detected in the writings of Arnaut Daniel, Dante, and Guido Cavalcanti, amongst others. For example, in his 1911–12 series of essays &quot;I gather the limbs of Osiris&quot;, Pound writes of Daniel&#x27;s line &quot;pensar de lieis m&#x27;es repaus&quot; (&quot;it rests me to think of her&quot;), from the canzone &quot;En breu brizara&#x27;l temps braus&quot;: &quot;You cannot get statement simpler than that, or clearer, or less rhetorical&quot;. These criteria—directness, clarity and lack of rhetoric—were to be amongst the defining qualities of Imagist poetry. Through his friendship with Laurence Binyon, Pound had already developed an interest in Japanese art by examining &quot;Nishiki-e&quot; prints at the British Museum, and he quickly became absorbed in the study of Japanese verse forms.

In a 1915 article in &quot;La France&quot;, French critic Remy de Gourmont described the Imagists as descendants of the French Symbolists. Pound emphasised that influence in a 1928 letter to the French critic and translator René Taupin. He pointed out that Hulme was indebted to the Symbolist tradition, via W. B. Yeats, Arthur Symons and the Rhymers&#x27; Club generation of British poets and Mallarmé. Taupin concluded in his 1929 study that however great the divergence of technique and language &quot;between the image of the Imagist and the &#x27;symbol&#x27; of the Symbolists[,] there is a difference only of precision&quot;. In 1915, Pound edited the poetry of another 1890s poet, Lionel Johnson. In his introduction, he wrote

==Early publications and statements of intent==

In 1911, Pound introduced two other poets to the Eiffel Tower group: his former fiancée Hilda Doolittle, who by then was writing under her initials, H.D., and H.D.&#x27;s future husband Richard Aldington. These two were interested in exploring Greek poetic models, especially Sappho, an interest that Pound shared. The compression of expression that they achieved by following the Greek example complemented the proto-Imagist interest in Japanese poetry, and, in 1912, during a meeting with them in the British Museum tea room, Pound told H.D. and Aldington that they were &quot;Imagistes&quot; and even appended the signature &quot;H.D. Imagiste&quot; to some poems they were discussing.

When Harriet Monroe started her &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine in 1911, she had asked Pound to act as foreign editor. In October 1912, he submitted thereto three poems each by H.D. and Aldington under the &quot;Imagiste&quot; rubric, with a note describing Aldington as &quot;one of the &#x27;Imagistes&#x27;&quot;. This note, along with the appendix note (&quot;The Complete Poetical Works of T. E. Hulme&quot;) in Pound&#x27;s book &quot;Ripostes&quot; (1912), are considered to be the first appearances of the word &quot;Imagiste&quot; (later anglicised to &quot;Imagist&quot;) in print.

Aldington&#x27;s poems, &quot;Choricos&quot;, &quot;To a Greek Marble&quot;, and &quot;Au Vieux Jardin&quot;, were in the November issue of &quot;Poetry&quot;, and H.D.&#x27;s, &quot;Hermes of the Ways&quot;, &quot;Priapus&quot;, and &quot;Epigram&quot;, appeared in the January 1913 issue, marking the beginning of the Imagism movement. &quot;Poetry&quot;″s April issue published Pound&#x27;s haiku-like &quot;In a Station of the Metro&quot;:

The March 1913 issue of &quot;Poetry&quot; contained &quot;A Few Don&#x27;ts by an Imagiste&quot; and the essay entitled &quot;Imagisme&quot; both written by Pound, with the latter attributed to Flint. The latter contained this succinct statement of the group&#x27;s position, which he had agreed with H.D. and Aldington:

Pound&#x27;s note opened with a definition of an image as &quot;that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time&quot;. Pound goes on to state,&quot;It is better to present one Image in a lifetime than to produce voluminous works&quot;. His list of &quot;don&#x27;ts&quot; reinforced his three statements in &quot;Imagism&quot;, while warning that they should not be considered as dogma but as the &quot;result of long contemplation&quot;. Taken together, these two texts comprised the Imagist programme for a return to what they saw as the best poetic practice of the past. F. S. Flint commented &quot;we have never claimed to have invented the moon. We do not pretend that our ideas are original.&quot;

The 1916 preface to &quot;Some Imagist Poets&quot; comments &quot;&quot;Imagism&quot; does not merely mean the presentation of pictures. &quot;Imagism&quot; refers to the manner of presentation, not to the subject.&quot;

==&quot;Des Imagistes&quot;==

Determined to promote the work of the Imagists, and particularly of Aldington and H.D., Pound decided to publish an anthology under the title &quot;Des Imagistes&quot;. It was first published in Alfred Kreymborg&#x27;s little magazine &quot;The Glebe&quot; and was later published in 1914 by Albert and Charles Boni in New York and by Harold Monro at the Poetry Bookshop in London. It became one of the most important and influential English-language collections of modernist verse. Included in the thirty-seven poems were ten poems by Aldington, seven by H.D., and six by Pound. The book also included work by Flint, Skipwith Cannell, Amy Lowell, William Carlos Williams, James Joyce, Ford Madox Ford, Allen Upward and John Cournos.

Pound&#x27;s editorial choices were based on what he saw as the degree of sympathy that the writers displayed with Imagist precepts, rather than active participation in a group. Williams, based in the United States, had not participated in any of the discussions of the Eiffel Tower group. However, he and Pound had long been corresponding on the question of the renewal of poetry along similar lines. Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound, as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier, Pre-Raphaelite-influenced style towards a harder, more modern way of writing. The anthology included the poem &quot;I Hear an Army&quot; by James Joyce, which was sent to Pound by W. B. Yeats.

==&quot;Some Imagist Poets&quot;==

An article on the history of Imagism was written by Flint and published in &quot;The Egoist&quot; in May 1915. Pound disagreed with Flint&#x27;s interpretation of events and the goals of the group, causing the two to cease contact with each other. Flint emphasised the contribution of the Eiffel Tower poets, especially Edward Storer. Pound, who believed that the &quot;Hellenic hardness&quot; that he saw as the distinguishing quality of the poems of H.D. and Aldington was likely to be diluted by the &quot;custard&quot; of Storer, was to play no further direct role in the history of the Imagists. He went on to co-found the Vorticists with his friend, the painter and writer Wyndham Lewis.

Around this time, the American Imagist Amy Lowell moved to London, determined to promote her own work and that of the other Imagist poets. Lowell was a wealthy heiress from Boston, whose brother Abbott Lawrence Lowell was President of Harvard University from 1909 to 1933. She was an enthusiastic champion of literary experiment who was willing to use her money to publish the group. Lowell was determined to change the method of selection from Pound&#x27;s autocratic editorial attitude to a more democratic manner. The outcome was a series of Imagist anthologies under the title &quot;Some Imagist Poets&quot;. The first of these appeared in 1915, planned and assembled mainly by H.D. and Aldington. Two further issues, both edited by Lowell, were published in 1916 and 1917. These three volumes featured most of the original poets, plus the American John Gould Fletcher, but not Pound, who had tried to persuade Lowell to drop the Imagist name from her publications and who sardonically dubbed this phase of Imagism &quot;Amygism&quot;.

Lowell persuaded D. H. Lawrence to contribute poems to the 1915 and 1916 volumes, making him the only writer to publish as both a Georgian poet and an Imagist. Marianne Moore also became associated with the group during this period. With World War I as a backdrop, the times were not easy for &quot;avant-garde&quot; literary movements (Aldington, for example, spent much of the war at the front), and the 1917 anthology effectively marked the end of the Imagists as a movement.

==After Imagism==

In 1929, Walter Lowenfels jokingly suggested that Aldington should produce a new Imagist anthology. Aldington, by now a successful novelist, took up the suggestion and enlisted the help of Ford and H.D. The result was the &quot;Imagist Anthology 1930&quot;, edited by Aldington and including all the contributors to the four earlier anthologies with the exception of Lowell, who had died, Cannell, who had disappeared, and Pound, who declined. The appearance of this anthology initiated a critical discussion of the place of the Imagists in the history of 20th-century poetry.

Of the poets who were published in the various Imagist anthologies, Joyce, Lawrence and Aldington are now primarily remembered and read as novelists. Marianne Moore, who was at most a fringe member of the group, carved out a unique poetic style of her own that retained an Imagist concern with compression of language. William Carlos Williams developed his poetic along distinctly American lines with his variable foot and a diction he claimed was taken &quot;from the mouths of Polish mothers&quot;. Both Pound and H.D. turned to long form poetry, but retained the hard edge to their language as an Imagist legacy. Most of the other members of the group are largely forgotten outside the context of Imagism.

==Legacy==
Despite the movement&#x27;s short life, Imagism would deeply influence the course of modernist poetry in English. Richard Aldington, in his 1941 memoir, writes: &quot;I think the poems of Ezra Pound, H.D., Lawrence, and Ford Madox Ford will continue to be read. And to a considerable extent T. S. Eliot and his followers have carried on their operations from positions won by the Imagists.&quot;

On the other hand, the American poet Wallace Stevens found shortcomings in the Imagist approach: &quot;Not all objects are equal. The vice of imagism was that it did not recognize this.&quot;
With its demand for hardness, clarity and precision and its insistence on fidelity to appearances coupled with its rejection of irrelevant subjective emotions Imagism had later effects that are demonstratable in T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Preludes&quot; and &quot;Morning at the Window&quot; and in Lawrence&#x27;s animal and flower pieces. The rejection of conventional verse forms in the nineteen-twenties owed much to the Imagists&#x27; repudiation of the Georgian Poetry style.

Imagism, which had made free verse a discipline and a legitimate poetic form, influenced a number of poetry circles and movements. Its influence can be seen clearly in the work of the Objectivist poets, who came to prominence in the 1930s under the auspices of Pound and Williams. The Objectivists worked mainly in free verse. Clearly linking Objectivism&#x27;s principles with Imagism&#x27;s, Louis Zukofsky insisted, in his introduction to the 1931 Objectivist issue of &quot;Poetry&quot;, on writing &quot;which is the detail, not mirage, of seeing, of thinking with the things as they exist, and of directing them along a line of melody.&quot; Zukofsky was a major influence on the Language poets, who carried the Imagist focus on formal concerns to a high level of development. In his seminal 1950 essay &quot;Projective Verse&quot;, Charles Olson, the theorist of the Black Mountain poets, wrote &quot;One perception must immediately and directly lead to a further perception&quot;, his credo derived from and supplemented the Imagists.

Among the Beats, Gary Snyder and Allen Ginsberg in particular were influenced by the Imagist emphasis on Chinese and Japanese poetry. Williams also had a strong effect on the Beat poets, encouraging poets like Lew Welch and writing an introduction for the book publication of Ginsberg&#x27;s &quot;Howl&quot; (1955).

<doc id="103247" wikidata="Q312686" url="?curid=103247" title="Giacomo Carissimi">
<text>(Gian) Giacomo Carissimi (; baptized 18 April 160512 January 1674) was an Italian composer and music teacher. He is one of the most celebrated masters of the early Baroque or, more accurately, the Roman School of music. Carissimi established the characteristic features of the Latin oratorio and was a prolific composer of masses, motets, and cantatas. He was highly influential in musical developments in northern European countries through his pupils, like Kerll in Germany and Charpentier in France, and the wide dissemination of his music.

==Biography==
Carissimi&#x27;s exact birthdate is not known, but it was probably in 1604 or 1605 in Marino near Rome, Italy. Of his early life almost nothing is known. Giacomo&#x27;s parents, Amico (1548–1633, a cooper by trade) and Livia (1565–1622), were married on 14 May 1595 and had four daughters and two sons; Giacomo was the youngest.

Nothing is known of his early musical training. His first known appointments were at Tivoli Cathedral, under the maestri di cappella Aurelio Briganti Colonna, Alessandro Capece and Francesco Manelli; from October 1623 he sang in the choir, and from October 1624 to October 1627 he was the organist. In 1628 Carissimi moved north to Assisi, as maestro di cappella (chapel master) at the Cathedral of San Rufino. In 1628 he obtained the same position at the church of Sant&#x27;Apollinare belonging to the Collegium Germanicum in Rome, which he held until his death. This was despite his receiving several offers to work in very prominent establishments, including an offer to take over from Claudio Monteverdi at San Marco di Venezia in Venice. In 1637 he was ordained a priest.

In 1656 Christina of Sweden, who was then living in Rome, appointed Carissimi as her &quot;maestro di cappella del concerto di camera&quot;. Lars Englund of Uppsala University has hypothesized that Christina’s early involvement with Carissimi&#x27;s music, and other church music from Rome, &quot;was part of a deliberate self-transformation, from a ruling Lutheran regent to a Catholic Queen without a land.&quot;

Carissimi seems to have never left Italy at all during his entire lifetime. He died in 1674 in Rome.

Carissimi&#x27;s successor as &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at the Collegium Germanicum in 1686 described him as tall, thin, very frugal in his domestic affairs, with very noble manners towards his friends and acquaintances, and prone to melancholy.

==Music==
The great achievements generally ascribed to Carissimi are the further development of the recitative, introduced by Monteverdi, which is highly important to the history of dramatic music; the further development of the chamber cantata, by which Carissimi superseded the concertato madrigals which had themselves replaced the madrigals of the late Renaissance; and the development of the oratorio, of which he was the first significant composer.

Carissimi&#x27;s position in the history of church, vocal and chamber music is somewhat similar to that of Francesco Cavalli in the history of opera. While Luigi Rossi was his predecessor in developing the chamber cantata, Carissimi was the composer who first made this form the vehicle for the most intellectual style of chamber music, a function which it continued to perform until the death of Alessandro Scarlatti, Emanuele d&#x27;Astorga and Benedetto Marcello.

Carissimi is also noted as one of the first composers of oratorios, with &quot;Jephte&quot; as probably his best-known work, along with &quot;Jonas&quot;. These works and others are important for establishing the form of oratorio unaccompanied by dramatic action, which maintained its hold for 200 years. The name comes from their presentation at the Oratory of Santissimo Crocifisso in Rome. He may also be credited for having given greater variety and interest to the instrumental accompaniments of vocal compositions. Charles Burney and John Hawkins both published specimens of his compositions in their works on the history of music, while Henry Aldrich collected an almost complete set of his compositions, which are currently housed at the library of Christ Church, Oxford. The British Museum also possesses numerous works by Carissimi. Most of his oratorios are in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris.

Carissimi was active at the time when secular music was about to usurp the dominance of sacred music in Italy. The change was decisive and permanent. When Carissimi began composing, the influence of the previous generations of Roman composers was still heavy (for instance, the style of Palestrina) and when his career came to a close the operatic forms, as well as the instrumental secular forms, were predominant. In addition, Carissimi was important as a teacher, and his influence spread far into Germany and France. Much of the musical style of Johann Caspar Kerll and Marc-Antoine Charpentier, for instance, was influenced by Carissimi.

Samuel Pepys was delighted with Carissimi&#x27;s music. His Diary records that he met &quot;Mr. Hill, and Andrews, and one slovenly and ugly fellow, Seignor Pedro, who sings Italian songs to the theorbo most neatly, and they spent the whole evening in singing the best piece of musique counted of all hands in the world, made by Seignor Charissimi, the famous master in Rome. Fine it was, indeed, and too fine for me to judge of.&quot;

Carissimi is the viewpoint character for the &quot;Euterpe&quot; series of short stories by Enrico M. Toro within the 1632 series of books edited by Eric Flint.

<text>Francesco Cavalli (born Pietro Francesco Caletti-Bruni; 14 February 1602 – 14 January 1676) was a Venetian composer, organist and singer of the early Baroque period. He succeeded his teacher Claudio Monteverdi as the dominant and leading opera composer of the mid 17th-century. A central figure of Venetian musical life, Cavalli wrote more than thirty operas, almost all of which premiered in the city&#x27;s theaters. His best known works include &quot;Ormindo&quot; (1644), &quot;Giasone&quot; (1649) and &quot;La Calisto&quot; (1651).

==Life==
Cavalli was born at Crema, then an inland province of the Venetian Republic. He became a singer (boy soprano) at St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice in 1616, where he had the opportunity to work under the tutorship of Claudio Monteverdi. He became second organist in 1639, first organist in 1665, and in 1668 &quot;maestro di cappella&quot;. He took the name &quot;Cavalli&quot; from his patron, Venetian nobleman Federico Cavalli. Though he wrote prolifically for the church, he is chiefly remembered for his operas. He began to write for the stage in 1639 (&quot;Le nozze di Teti e di Peleo&quot;) soon after the first public opera house opened in Venice, the Teatro San Cassiano. He established so great a reputation that he was summoned to Paris from 1660 (when he revived his opera &quot;Xerse&quot;) until 1662, producing his &quot;Ercole amante&quot;. He died in Venice at the age of 73.

==Music and influence==
Cavalli was the most influential composer in the rising genre of public opera in mid-17th-century Venice. Unlike Monteverdi&#x27;s early operas, scored for the extravagant court orchestra of Mantua, Cavalli&#x27;s operas make use of a small orchestra of strings and basso continuo to meet the limitations of public opera houses.

Cavalli introduced melodious arias into his music and popular types into his libretti. His operas have a remarkably strong sense of dramatic effect as well as a great musical facility, and a grotesque humour which was characteristic of Italian opera down to the death of Alessandro Scarlatti. Cavalli&#x27;s operas provide the only example of a continuous musical development of a single composer in a single genre from the early to the late 17th century in Venice — only a few operas by others (e.g., Monteverdi and Antonio Cesti) survive. The development is particularly interesting to scholars because opera was still quite a new medium when Cavalli began working, and had matured into a popular public spectacle by the end of his career.

More than forty-two operas have been attributed to Cavalli. Manuscript scores of twenty-six are extant, preserved in the Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana (Library of St Mark) in Venice. Scores of some of the operas also exist in other locations. In addition, the music of his two last operas (&quot;Coriolano&quot; and &quot;Masenzio&quot;), which are clearly attributed to him, is lost. Another twelve or so for which the music is lost have also been attributed to him, but these attributions have either been disproved or remain uncertain. Cristoforo Ivanovich, who published the first chronicle of Venetian opera, &quot;Minerva al tavolino&quot; (Venice, 1681), attributed most of the anonymous works from the first 15 years of public performances in Venice to Cavalli, and many of these attributions were repeated by subsequent authors. The American musicologist Thomas Walker, writing in &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Opera&quot;, considered seven of Ivanovich&#x27;s attributions and another two by other authors as doubtful.

In addition to operas, Cavalli wrote settings of the &quot;Magnificat&quot; in the grand Venetian polychoral style, settings of the Marian antiphons, other sacred music in a more conservative manner – notably a Requiem Mass in eight parts (SSAATTBB), probably intended for his own funeral – and some instrumental music.

===Modern performances===
Cavalli&#x27;s music was revived in the twentieth century. The Glyndebourne Opera production of &quot;La Calisto,&quot; in 1970, is an example. More recently, &quot;Hipermestra&quot; was performed at Glyndebourne in 2017.
The discography is extensive and Cavalli has featured in BBC Radio 3&#x27;s &quot;Composer of the Week&quot; series.

<text>Benedetto Giacomo Marcello (; 31 July or 1 August 1686 – 24 July 1739) was an Italian composer, writer, advocate, magistrate, and teacher.

==Life==
Born in Venice, Benedetto Marcello was a member of a noble family and in his compositions, he is frequently referred to anonymously as &quot;Patrizio Veneto&quot; (Venetian patrician, i.e. aristocrat). Although he was a music student of Antonio Lotti and Francesco Gasparini, his father wanted Benedetto to devote himself to law. Benedetto managed to combine a life in law and public service with one in music. In 1711 he was appointed a member of the Council of Forty (in Venice&#x27;s central government), and in 1730 he went to Pola as &quot;Provveditore&quot; (district governor). Due to his health having been &quot;impaired by the climate&quot; of Istria, Marcello retired after eight years in the capacity of &quot;Camerlengo&quot; (chamberlain) to Brescia where he died of tuberculosis in 1739.

Benedetto Marcello was the brother of Alessandro Marcello, also a notable composer. On 20 May 1728 Benedetto Marcello married his singing student Rosanna Scalfi in a secret ceremony. However, as a nobleman, his marriage to a commoner was unlawful; after his death, the marriage was declared null by the state. Rosanna was unable to inherit his estate, and filed suit in 1742 against Benedetto&#x27;s brother Alessandro, seeking financial support.

==Music==

Marcello composed a variety of music including considerable church music, oratorios, hundreds of solo cantatas, duets, sonatas, concertos and sinfonias. Marcello was a younger contemporary of Antonio Vivaldi in Venice and his instrumental music enjoys a Vivaldian flavour.

As a composer, Marcello was best known in his lifetime and is now still best remembered for his &quot;Estro poetico-armonico&quot; (Venice, 1724–27), a musical setting for voices, figured bass (a continuo notation), and occasional solo instruments, of the first fifty Psalms, as paraphrased in Italian by his friend G. Giustiniani. They were much admired by Charles Avison, who with John Garth brought out an edition with English words (London, 1757). &quot;Estro poetico-armonico&quot; also represents an important contribution to the history of Jewish liturgical music. Eleven of the Psalms are set to melodies that Marcello apparently transcribed while attending services at several Venetian synagogues. The eleven melodies – six from the Ashkenazic tradition, and five from the Sephardic tradition – are among the earliest notated sources of Jewish liturgy, preceded only by Salamone Rossi&#x27;s &quot;Hashirim Asher L’Shlomo&quot;. Perhaps the best known of these melodies is an Ashkenazic melody for Ma&#x27;oz Tzur.

The library of the Brussels Conservatoire possesses some interesting volumes of chamber cantatas composed by Marcello for his mistress. Although Benedetto Marcello wrote an opera called &quot;La Fede riconosciuta&quot; and produced it in Vicenza in 1702, he had little sympathy with this form of composition, as evidenced in his writings (see below).

Benedetto Marcello&#x27;s music is &quot;characterized by imagination and a fine technique and includes both counterpoint and progressive, galant features&quot;..

With the poet Antonio Schinella Conti he wrote a series of experimental long cantatas – a duet, &quot;Il Timoteo&quot;, then five monologues, &quot;Cantone,&quot; &quot;Lucrezia,&quot; &quot;Andromaca,&quot; &quot;Arianna abandonnata,&quot; and finally &quot;Cassandra&quot;.

==Writing==
Marcello vented his opinions on the state of musical drama at the time in the satirical pamphlet &quot;Il teatro alla moda&quot;, published anonymously in Venice in 1720. This little work, which was frequently reprinted, is not only extremely amusing, but is most valuable as a contribution to the history of opera.

==Legacy==
The composer Joachim Raff wrote an opera entitled &quot;Benedetto Marcello&quot;, based loosely on the life of Marcello and Scalfi.

The Conservatorio di Musica Benedetto Marcello di Venezia was named after him.

A street in Rome, &quot;Largo Benedetto Marcello&quot;, is named after him.

<text>John Ralston Saul (born June 19, 1947) is a Canadian writer, political philosopher, and public intellectual. Saul is most widely known for his writings on the nature of individualism, citizenship and the public good; the failures of manager-led societies; the confusion between leadership and managerialism; military strategy, in particular irregular warfare; the role of freedom of speech and culture; and critiques of the prevailing economic paradigm. He is a champion of freedom of expression and was the International President of PEN International, an association of writers. Saul is the co-founder and co-chair of the Institute for Canadian Citizenship, a national charity promoting the inclusion of new citizens. He is also the co-founder and co-chair of 6 Degrees, the global forum for inclusion. Saul is also the husband to the former governor general Adrienne Clarkson, making him the Viceregal consort of Canada during most of her service (1999–2005).

His work is known for being thought-provoking and ahead of its time, leading him to be called a &quot;prophet&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; and to be included in &quot;Utne Reader&quot;&#x27;s list of the world&#x27;s leading thinkers and visionaries. His works have been translated into 25 languages in 36 countries.

== Early life and education ==
Saul is the son of William Saul, an army officer, and a British mother whose family had a long tradition of military service. He was born in Ottawa, but raised in Alberta and Manitoba before graduating from Oakville Trafalgar High School in Oakville, Ontario. At a young age, he became fluent in both national languages, French and English. By the time he started university at McGill University, Montreal, his father was in Paris and Brussels, working as a military adviser to the Canadian ambassador to NATO.

== Career ==
After completing his undergraduate degree, Saul was accepted into the foreign service, but the death of his father in 1968 changed Saul&#x27;s career plans. He left the foreign service to attend King&#x27;s College London, where he wrote his thesis on the modernization of France under Charles de Gaulle, and earned his PhD in 1972. His doctoral thesis, &quot;The Evolution of Civil–Military Relations in France after the Algerian War&quot;, led him to France for research. There he began to write his first novel, &quot;Mort d&#x27;un général&quot;, a romanticized version of his thesis on de Gaulle&#x27;s chief of staff. He supported himself by running the French subsidiary of a British investment company.

After helping to set up the national oil company Petro-Canada in 1976, as assistant to its first chair, Maurice F. Strong, Saul published his first novel, &quot;The Birds of Prey&quot;, in 1977. Strong described Saul as &quot;an invaluable, though unconventional, member of my personal staff.&quot;

Through the late 1970s into the 1980s, Saul travelled extensively and regularly spent time with guerrilla armies, spending a great deal of time in North Africa and South East Asia. Out of this time came his novels, &quot;The Field Trilogy&quot;. It was during those extended periods in Northwest Africa and Southeast Asia where he witnessed fellow writers there suffering government suppression of freedom of expression, which caused him to become interested in the work of PEN International. Between the years of 1990 and 1992, Saul acted as the president of the Canadian centre of PEN International. In 2009, he was elected president of PEN and re-elected for a second and last term in 2012, remaining International President until October 2015.

Saul is co-chair of the Institute for Canadian Citizenship, which encourages new Canadians to become active citizens. He is patron and former president of the Canadian Centre of PEN International and of the Canadian Academy of Independent Scholars. He is also founder and honorary chair of French for the Future, which encourages bilingual French-English education, chair of the advisory board for the LaFontaine-Baldwin Symposium lecture series, and a patron of Planned Lifetime Advocacy Network. From 1999 until 2006, his wife Adrienne Clarkson was Governor General of Canada, making him Canada&#x27;s viceregal consort. During this period he devoted much of his time to issues of freedom of expression, poverty, public education and bilingualism.

=== PEN International ===
Saul was elected as the international president of PEN International for a three-year term at its Annual Congress in Linz, Austria in October 2009. He was the first Canadian to be elected to that position, which had previously been held by John Galsworthy, Arthur Miller, Heinrich Böll, Mario Vargas Llosa and Homero Aridjis. He campaigned on the need to pay attention to smaller and endangered languages and cultures, arguing that the ultimate removal of freedom of expression was the loss of a language. He put a specific emphasis on endangered indigenous languages. He called for a further decentralization of PEN, which has 144 centres in 102 countries. He argues that literature and freedom of expression are the same thing; that you cannot have one without the other. Saul has testified before the European Parliament Human Rights Commission on the loss of freedom of expression in Tunisia, has spoken before European Council on Refugees in Exile, and has published an essay on writers in exile, which has been translated into several languages.

=== The Institute for Canadian Citizenship ===
Saul founded, and currently co-chairs, the Institute for Canadian Citizenship (ICC) with Adrienne Clarkson. The ICC is a national, non-profit charity that helps accelerate new citizens&#x27; integration into Canadian life through original programs, collaborations and unique volunteer opportunities. While its focus is on encouraging new citizens to take their rightful place in Canada, the ICC aims to encourage all citizens – new or not – to embrace active citizenship in their daily life.

=== Speaking ===
In addition to his selection as the 1995 Massey lecturer, Saul has delivered other notable lectures. He gave the Harold Innis Lecture in 1994. In 2000 he gave the inaugural LaFontaine-Baldwin Symposium
Lecture. Saul delivered the J.D. Young Memorial Lecture &quot;A New Era of Irregular Warfare?&quot; at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario on February 4, 2004. He gave the 2005 IDEAS lecture in Brisbane, Australia, the 2007 Captive Mind Lecture in Kraków, Poland, and in 2008 gave the 33rd Sir Winston Scott Memorial Lecture in Barbados. He also delivered the 2009 McGill Law Journal&#x27;s Annual Lecture at the McGill Faculty of Law in Montreal on February 3, 2009. Saul also spoke at the Sydney Opera House on August 26, 2012, on the subject &quot;It&#x27;s Broke: How do we fix it?&quot;

=== Fiction writing ===

&quot;The Birds of Prey&quot; (1977) is a political novel based in Gaullist France. Between 1983 and 1988 Saul then published &quot;The Field Trilogy&quot;, which deals with the crisis of modern power and its clash with the individual. It includes &quot;Baraka, or The Lives, Fortunes and Sacred Honor of Anthony Smith&quot; (1983), &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot; (1986), and &quot;The Paradise Eater&quot; (1988), which won the &quot;Premio Letterario Internazionale&quot; in Italy.

&quot;De si bons Américains&quot; (1994) is a picaresque novel in which he observes the lives of America&#x27;s &quot;nouveaux riches&quot;. A vastly reworked and expanded version was published in 2012 as &quot;Dark Diversions&quot;, Saul&#x27;s first novel in over fifteen years.

=== Non-fiction writing ===

==== &quot;Voltaire&#x27;s Bastards&quot;, &quot;The Doubter&#x27;s Companion&quot; and &quot;The Unconscious Civilization&quot; ====
Saul&#x27;s non-fiction began with the trilogy comprising the bestseller &quot;Voltaire&#x27;s Bastards: The Dictatorship of Reason in the West&quot; (1992), the polemic philosophical dictionary &quot;The Doubter&#x27;s Companion: A Dictionary of Aggressive Common Sense&quot; (1994), and the book that grew out of his 1995 Massey Lectures, &quot;The Unconscious Civilization&quot; (1995). The last won the 1996 Governor General&#x27;s Award for Non-Fiction Literature.

These books deal with themes such as the dictatorship of reason unbalanced by other human qualities, how it can be used for any ends especially in a directionless state that rewards the pursuit of power for power&#x27;s sake. He argues that this leads to deformations of thought such as ideology promoted as truth; the rational but anti-democratic structures of corporatism, by which he means the worship of small groups; and the use of language and expertise to mask a practical understanding of the harm caused by this, and what else our society might do. He argues that the rise of individualism with no regard for the role of society has not created greater individual autonomy and self-determination, as was once hoped, but isolation and alienation. He calls for a pursuit of a more humanist ideal in which reason is balanced with other human mental capacities such as common sense, ethics, intuition, creativity, and memory, for the sake of the common good, and he discusses the importance of unfettered language and practical democracy. These attributes are elaborated upon in his 2001 book &quot;On Equilibrium&quot;.

==== &quot;Reflections of a Siamese Twin&quot; ====
He expanded on these themes as they relate to Canada and its history and culture in &quot;Reflections of a Siamese Twin&quot; (1998). In this book, he proposed the idea of Canada being a &quot;soft&quot; country, meaning not that the nation is weak, but that it has a flexible and complex identity, as opposed to the unyielding or monolithic identities of other states.

He argues that Canada&#x27;s complex national identity is made up of the &quot;triangular reality&quot; of the three nations that compose it: First Peoples, francophones, and anglophones. He emphasizes the willingness of these Canadian nations to compromise with one another, as opposed to resorting to open confrontations. In the same vein, he criticizes both those in the Quebec separatist Montreal School for emphasizing the conflicts in Canadian history and the Orange Order and the Clear Grits traditionally seeking clear definitions of Canadian-ness and loyalty.

==== &quot;On Equilibrium&quot; ====
Saul&#x27;s next book, &quot;On Equilibrium&quot; (2001), is effectively a fourth, concluding volume to his philosophical quartet. He identifies six qualities as common to all people: common sense, ethics, imagination, intuition, memory, and reason. He describes how these inner forces can be used to balance each other, and what happens when they are unbalanced, for example in the case of a &quot;Dictatorship of Reason&quot;.

==== &quot;The Collapse of Globalism&quot; ====
In an article written for &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; magazine&#x27;s March 2004 issue, titled &quot;The Collapse of Globalism and the Rebirth of Nationalism&quot;, he argued that the globalist ideology was under attack by counter-movements. Saul rethought and developed this argument in &quot;The Collapse of Globalism and the Reinvention of the World&quot; (2005). Far from being an inevitable force, Saul argued that globalization is already breaking down in the face of widespread public opposition and that the world was seeing a rise in nationalism. Following the Great Recession he had predicted, &quot;The Collapse of Globalism&quot; was re-issued in 2009 with a new epilogue that addressed the economic crisis.

==== &quot;A Fair Country&quot; ====
&quot;A Fair Country&quot; (2008) is Saul&#x27;s second major work on Canada. It is organized into four subsections.
;&quot;A Métis Civilization&quot;: This section picks up on the argument that Saul makes in &quot;Reflections of a Siamese Twin&quot; about the &#x27;triangular reality of Canada&#x27;. Drawing on the work of scholars like Harold Innis and Gerald Friesen, Saul argues that contemporary Canada has been deeply influenced and shaped by Aboriginal ideas and the experience of both Francophone and Anglophone immigrants over the 250 years, from 1600 on, during which Aboriginals were either the dominant force in Canada, or equal partners. He argues that Aboriginals are making a rapid &quot;comeback&quot;, and that their fundamental influence needs to be recognized in order for non-Aboriginal Canadians to understand themselves.

;&quot;Peace, Fairness, and Good Government&quot;: In this section Saul argues that instead of the phrase &quot;peace, order, and good government&quot;, which appears in and has become a touchstone of the 1867 Canadian Constitution, the phrase that dominated previous Canadian documents was &quot;peace, &quot;welfare&quot;, and good government&quot;. Saul suggests that the ensuing emphasis on &quot;order&quot; has not truly represented Canadian origins.

;&quot;The Castrati&quot;: This sections echoes Saul&#x27;s more general critiques of technocratic and bureaucratic regimes. He also suggests that while current Canadian elites reflect a &quot;disturbing mediocrity&quot; this was not always the case.

;&quot;An Intentional Civilization&quot;: Saul uses the final section of the book to argue for a return to an understanding of Canada as a unique response to particular historical circumstances.

==== &quot;Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine and Robert Baldwin&quot; ====
Saul&#x27;s contribution to Penguin Canada&#x27;s &quot;Extraordinary Canadians&quot; series, of which he serves as general editor, is a double biography of Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine and Robert Baldwin. In it, he argues that Canada did not begin in 1867, but that in fact its foundations were laid by LaFontaine and Baldwin much earlier. The two leaders of Lower and Upper Canada, respectively, worked together after the 1841 Union to lead a reformist movement for responsible government run by elected citizens instead of a colonial governor. But it was during the &quot;Great Ministry&quot; of 1848–51 that the two politicians implemented laws that Saul argues created a more equitable country. They revamped judicial institutions, created a public education system, made bilingualism official, designed a network of public roads, began a public postal system, and reformed municipal governance. Faced with opposition, and even violence, Saul contends that the two men united behind a set of principles and programs that formed modern Canada.

==== &quot;The Comeback&quot; ====
His most recent work, &quot;The Comeback: How Aboriginals Are Reclaiming Power and Influence&quot; (2014) was a shortlisted nominee for the 2015 Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing. The &quot;comeback&quot; that Saul identifies in this new book emphasizes the strides that Aboriginal people have made in reversing years of population decline and &quot;cultural oppression&quot;. As recently as seventy years ago it was widely assumed that Indians were disappearing, the victims of disease, starvation and their own ineptitude for modern civilization. Canada&#x27;s Aboriginal population is growing in numbers and its cultural and political self-confidence seems boundless. In Saul&#x27;s view, this observation, while obvious to anyone who studies the history, nonetheless needs hammering home. We are far more used to hearing about the dismal lives of Aboriginal people—their family dysfunction, their crime rates, their impoverished communities—than we are to being told they are a success story. Today&#x27;s Aboriginal population, for all the problems that afflict it, has overcome incredible disadvantages to achieve what Saul calls &quot;a position of power, influence and civilizational creativity&quot; in Canadian society.

<doc id="103258" wikidata="Q6522981" url="?curid=103258" title="Sverok">
<text>Sverok – Spelkulturförbundet (The Swedish Gaming Federation) is a Swedish nationwide umbrella organization for gaming clubs. Sverok brings together the Swedish gaming hobby and, with 55,000 members in 1700 affiliated organisations, is one of the country&#x27;s largest youth associations. Board games, miniature wargaming, collector&#x27;s card games, role-playing games, e-sport, LAN, video games, airsoft, Asian popular culture, live action role-playing games (LARP), laser tag, paintball and fantasy are the main hobby branches. The organisation was founded in 1988 under the name Sveriges roll- och konfliktspelsförbund (Sverok) but has since adopted the abbreviation as its sole name because the organisation now encompasses many more branches of activity than when it was founded. Sverok has grown since then, both in terms of membership and the breadth of its activities. The Swedish Agency for Youth and Civil Society (MUCF) classifies Sverok as a youth organisation, as 92% of the organisation&#x27;s members are young people aged 7–25. Sverok is a member organisation of Studiefrämjandet.

==Organisation==
Sverok consists of 841 independent member associations, which together have about 55,000 members. The organisation is governed by a board, which within Sverok is called the Federal Board (Förbundsstyrelsen) and is usually abbreviated to FS. In addition, Sverok has an administrative office in Linköping and Stockholm with about 20 employees who handle finances and association administration. Sverok also remunerates its förbundsordförande and general secretary on a full-time basis. There are also a number of working groups that work on a voluntary basis on behalf of the federal board. Sverok is organized in a democratic fashion. The member associations form the member base and all activity good and proper is performed by them. The districts and the national organization generally do not organize gaming events by themselves, rather opting to support local projects (the districts) or the clubs in general by means of funding, services and lobbying (the national organization), which makes it possible for some associations to organize bigger events such as gaming conventions, larps, LAN parties or other events related to their interest.

Member associations vary in size from five to tens of thousands. The vast majority of associations consist of between five and 50 people. The nature of the activities, and hence, associations, vary greatly, spanning both indoors and outdoors activities, with or without computers, with or without propping equipment. How a club is run is entirely up to the club as long as it&#x27;s organized in a democratic fashion and is open for anyone to become a member and as democratic entities they are required to hold annual meetings within their own groups.

==Förbundsstyrelsen==
Förbundsstyrelsen within Sverok, FS, consists of 5-10 members, a förbundsordförande, a secretary and a vice förbundsordförande. The latter three make up Sverok&#x27;s executive committee, which has the task of implementing all the proposals that the national meeting assigns to FS. A member of the board has a specific area of responsibility. Examples of areas of responsibility: financial manager, district manager, association manager and personnel manager.

=== Riksmöte ===
Sverok&#x27;s highest decision-making body is Sverok&#x27;s annual meeting, which within the organisation is called the Riksmöte, abbreviated RM. Just over a hundred representatives of the associations attend the Riksmöte. At the assembly, the affiliated associations have direct decision-making power regarding the activities and focus of the national organisation, as well as who should be on the board.

According to Sverok&#x27;s statutes, the board shall as previously stated have 5-10 members, a förbundsordförande, a secretary and a vice förbundsordförande. The RM decides on all positions except for the union secretary (förbundssekreterare), which the RM only recommends, mainly for practical reasons. The ability of the RM and the districts to influence the activities of their own organisation and the affiliated associations is largely limited as neither the federal board nor the districts have any voting rights.

The annual general meeting of the districts are fairly similar but on a regional level. Generally there&#x27;s no nomination process – clubs are allowed to show up with a number of representatives with voting power (and traditionally, whoever else feels like showing up), the number based on their headcount.

=== Districts ===
Sverok is divided into twelve districts that cover the entire country. The geographical division of the districts is largely based on Sweden&#x27;s county councils. The members of the districts are the Sverok-affiliated organisations that have their headquarters in the county councils that make up each district.

Sverok&#x27;s districts have basically the same purpose as the federation but operate regionally. Since the districts have different conditions and the priorities differ between the districts, their activities can vary greatly between them. However, every year the districts must apply for money from the county council(s) they belong to.

Otherwise, typical activities of the districts are: contact brokers for the associations, attending conventions or other events in the district, arranging trips to events elsewhere in the country and abroad, or organising training courses for the associations. The districts have their own independent annual meetings, where representatives of the associations are present and directly decide who is to be included in the organisation&#x27;s board and what activities are to be focused on; the national organisation has very limited power to decide what the districts should do, as these districts are highly autonomous and are governed primarily by RM and the district annual meeting.

==Funding and economy of Sverok==
Any sufficiently large – 3000 members or more – youth organization organized in a democratic manner is eligible to receive government funding to cover operating expenses. Historically (pre 2001) this has been calculated from the amount of activity generated in the member clubs. Since 2001 it is instead based on the number of member clubs and the headcount they represent.

All in all 106 organizations receive this governmental support - this includes both party political organizations, local branches of international organizations such as Red Cross youth organization and the Scouts, disabilities youth organizations and more hobby related organizations such as Sverok. Notably, it does not include sport organizations.

The 2015 governmental support was approximately 10 000 000 SEK. Half of this sum is used to cover administration costs, basic democratic functions, insurances for members while engaging in their hobby and so forth. The remainder – a stated target has traditionally been at least 50% – is paid directly to the member clubs, the sums varying in size according to the number of members.

The districts of Sverok receive funding directly from their respective counties and is not included in the above tally (although there are exceptions). The amount of support received and reasons for receiving it varies from county to county. The densely populated ones have well over €50 000 (Stockholm over €100 000) while the more rural areas tend to hand out less funding. This funding cover administration, basic democratic functions and support to local clubs in ways appropriate for the region.

How the money is spent differs greatly. Members in some (often rather densely populated) parts of the country prefer manned offices. Other districts are spread out in such a fashion that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to keep a central office; hence their organization is a lot more virtual by nature. Apart from rent and salaries, common ways to spend the money include subsidized trips to big gaming events, monetary support for local events and cheap-or-free storage or rental of equipment, among other things. Due to the very nature of this arrangement, things have a tendency to come and go —some years a particular district finds it fit to print a member magazine, other years not.

==History and pre-history of Sverok==
Sweden has a long history when it comes to gaming and role-playing. In 1972, the oldest member organization in Sverok was founded: Forodrim, in Stockholm. In 1976, GothCon (the oldest still-active gaming convention in the world) took place for the first time. Gamers in Gothenburg gathered over Easter to play games and generally congregate. Another notable convention is LinCon.

In 1982, the first Swedish RPG was published: &quot;Drakar och Demoner&quot;, based on Basic Role Playing. The title translates to &quot;Dragons and Demons&quot;, and in Sweden, it has the same status and recognition as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; has in English-speaking countries. During the 1980s, the role-playing and board gaming hobby grew to larger proportions. Several new gaming conventions popped up in various parts of the country, some of which are still active. Numerous gaming clubs were formed as well. In Sweden, most counties give support to youth clubs of a decent size. By uniting the local gamers, many clubs got free or cheap places to keep their equipment and play their games.

Sverok was founded in late 1988 to act as an umbrella organization for the various gaming clubs. During the early years numerous existing gaming clubs joined Sverok and a push by the organization was also made to generate new clubs – by informing youths about how to go about it. Since forming a club and joining Sverok meant receiving funds (rather than paying a membership fee) many teenagers saw it as a good way of getting some gaming supplements essentially for free. The only real requirements were – and are – that the clubs need to be open for members and organized in a democratic fashion. From a governmental perspective, this ensures that a large number of people are involved in a democratic process early on in life. During these early years much of the organizing of the federation itself was done on a volunteer basis.

Another important reason for gamers to unite was strength in numbers. What was previously seen as a niche phenomena turned more and more mainstream as the organization gained members. This proved useful in the mid-1990s when claims about role-playing being detrimental to the mental health of youth and links to satanism gained a fair amount of media attention, calling for a ban on tabletop role-playing games or at the very least cut funding for Sverok. Already having gained a large following, Sverok was able to stand as a counterpart to these claims in TV debates and newspaper opinion pages.

By 1997, Sverok had a member base of over 20 000. It eventually declined somewhat to about 16 000 in 2001 (a nationwide slump in youth organization membership in general) when another push for more exposure and encouraging members to form new clubs was coordinated alongside a crucial change in the basis for government support money carried the official headcount over 100 000 in 2005. Today (as of December 2014) Sverok have approximately 80 000 members in 1200 clubs. 16 people are currently working in administration and special projects such as NAB (Norms, attitudes and behaviours) and Respect All, Compete (for a more welcoming climate in e-sports).

<doc id="103260" wikidata="Q472714" url="?curid=103260" title="Luigi Rossi">
<text>Luigi Rossi (c. 1597 – 20 February 1653) was an Italian Baroque composer. Born in Torremaggiore, a small town near Foggia, in the ancient kingdom of Naples, at an early age he went to Naples where he studied music with the Franco-Flemish composer Jean de Macque, organist of the Santa Casa dell’Annunziata and &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; to the Spanish viceroy. Rossi later entered the service of the Caetani, dukes of Traetta.

== Life ==
Rossi composed two operas: &quot;Il palazzo incantato&quot;, which was given at Rome in 1642; and &quot;Orfeo&quot;, written after he was invited by Cardinal Mazarin in 1646 to go to Paris for that purpose and given its premiere there in 1647. Rossi returned to France in 1648 hoping to write another opera, but no production was possible because the court had sought refuge outside Paris. Rossi returned to Rome by 1650 and never attempted anything more for the stage.

A collection of cantatas published in 1646 describes him as musician to Cardinal Antonio Barberini, while Giacomo Antonio Perti in 1688 speaks of him along with Carissimi and Cesti as &quot;the three greatest lights of our profession.&quot;

Rossi is noteworthy principally for his chamber-cantatas, which are among the finest that the 17th century produced. A large number of the 300 he left are in manuscripts in the British Library and in Christ Church Library, Oxford. &quot;La Gelosia&quot;, printed by F. A. Gevaert in &quot;Les Gloires d&#x27;Italie&quot;, is an admirable specimen.

<text>Antonio Cesti (; baptised Pietro Cesti, 5 August 1623; died 14 October 1669), known today primarily as an Italian composer of the Baroque era, was also a singer (tenor) and organist. He was &quot;the most celebrated Italian musician of his generation&quot;.

== Biography ==
He was baptised Pietro Cesti at Arezzo on 5 August 1623. Claims that he studied with Giacomo Carissimi &quot;appear to be groundless&quot;.

In 1637 he joined the Order of Friars Minor, or Franciscans, a Roman Catholic religious group founded by Francis of Assisi, and took the name Antonio. (He has also been referred to as &#x27;Marc&#x27; Antonio&#x27;, but this is incorrect.) While he was in Volterra he turned more toward secular music, perhaps due to the patronage and influence of the powerful Medici family. Here he also came in contact with Salvator Rosa, who wrote libretti for a number of Cesti&#x27;s cantatas. By 1650 Cesti&#x27;s calling as a Franciscan friar and his success as a singer and composer for operas were coming into conflict, and he was officially reprimanded. 

In 1652 he became a member of the court at Innsbruck of Ferdinand Charles, Archduke of Austria. 
One of his Innsbruck residences was the still existing Cesti House in Pfarrgasse 5. 

After holding a post somewhere in Florence as &quot;maestro di cappella&quot;, he entered the papal chapel in 1660. In 1666 he became Vice-Kapellmeister at Vienna, and died at Florence in 1669.

== Music ==
Cesti is known principally as a composer of operas. The most celebrated of these were &quot;La Dori&quot; (Innsbruck, 1657), &quot;Il pomo d&#x27;oro&quot; (Vienna, 1668) and &quot;Orontea&quot; (1656). &quot;Il pomo d&#x27;oro&quot; (&quot;The Golden Apple&quot;) was written for the wedding in Vienna of Emperor Leopold I in 1666, and first performed in 1668, in a famously lavish production. It was far more elaborate than contemporary Venetian operas, including a large orchestra, numerous choruses, and various mechanical devices used to stage things like gods descending from heaven (&quot;deus ex machina&quot;), naval battles, and storms.

&quot;Orontea&quot; was revived seventeen times in the next thirty years, making it one of the most frequently performed operas on the continent in the mid-17th century. Even Samuel Pepys owned a copy of the score. It includes a well-known soprano aria &quot;Intorno all&#x27;idol mio&quot; (&quot;Around my idol&quot;).

Cesti was also a composer of chamber cantatas, and his operas are notable for the pure and delicate style of their airs, more suited to the chamber than to the stage. He wrote in the &quot;bel canto&quot; style of the 17th century, and his compositions were heavily influenced by his career as a professional singer. His musical writing owes much to the emerging tonality of the time.

Cesti composed several of his operas for the new court theatre &quot;Neues Komödienhaus&quot; at Innsbruck which was commissioned by Archduke Ferdinand Charles based on plans of local architect Christoph Gumpp the Younger. That theatre was – yet unfinished – inaugurated in 1654 with the performance of Cesti&#x27;s opera &quot;La Cleopatra&quot;. It was the first detached opera house in the German-speaking area with salaried staff and was later replaced by another theatre. In 1655, Cesti&#x27;s opera &quot;L&#x27;Argia&quot; was premiered in Innsbruck on the visit of the Swedish Queen Christina to celebrate her conversion to Catholicism.

As singer, Cesti performed roles in tenor and later also bass voice.

The yearly competition &quot;Internationaler Gesangwettbewerb für Barockoper Pietro Antonio Cesti&quot; for singers was named after him. It was established in 2010 by the conductor Alessandro De Marchi.

<doc id="103262" wikidata="Q1272834" url="?curid=103262" title="D'Aguilar National Park">
<text>D&#x27;Aguilar National Park is a national park in Queensland, Australia. It contains the D&#x27;Aguilar Range and is located along the northwest of the Brisbane metropolitan area. The park is traversed by the winding scenic Mount Nebo Road and Mount Glorious Road.

The park contains eucalyptus woodlands, sheltered pockets of sub-tropical rainforest, a number of crevasses and views of Moreton Bay and the Glass House Mountains. The Walkabout Creek Visitor Centre is located at the edge of the park. There are two formal, vehicle accessible camping areas in the Mount Mee section and eight remote bush camping sites (accessible only by walking) in the southern D&#x27;Aguilar (formerly Brisbane Forest Park) section. Popular lookouts include Jolly&#x27;s Lookout, Westridge Outlook, Camp Mountain Lookout and Wivenhoe Lookout, overlooking Lake Wivenhoe. The villages of Mount Nebo and Mount Glorious are located on Mount Nebo Road on the edges of the national park and are popular stops for tourists driving through the park.

The southern part of the park was formerly known as Brisbane Forest Park, while the northern part of the park is at Mount Mee.

==Flora==
Woodlands and dry eucalypt forests predominate on the drier, shallower soils of the park&#x27;s foothills. Spotted Gum (Corymbia variegata) and Narrow-leaved Ironbark are two of the main species. There are also small areas of heath and ridges dominated by grass trees (Xanthorrhoea spp). Remnant pockets of lowland rainforest occur in the valleys along some of the watercourses.

At higher altitudes the forests become more complex due to the increased rainfall and generally deeper soils. These mid-altitude forests are dominated by Grey Gum, Pink Bloodwood and Brush Box. Occasional rainforest species are also present and there is a thick understorey of ferns, vines and shrubs.
Moist sub-tropical rainforest grows on the highest parts of the range where the rainfall is two-thirds greater than in the foothills, particularly on the rich basaltic soils north of Mt Glorious. Huge strangler figs (&quot;Ficus watkinsiana&quot;) can be seen emerging through the canopy.

==Fauna==
More than 240 species of birds have been recorded in the park, including the noisy pitta (&quot;Pitta versicolor&quot;), southern logrunner (&quot;Orthonyx temminckii&quot;), paradise riflebird (&quot;Ptiloris paradiseus&quot;), regent bowerbird (&quot;Sericulus chrysocephalus&quot;), satin bowerbird (&quot;Ptilonorhynchus violaceus&quot;), brush-turkey (&quot;Alectura lathami&quot;), laughing kookaburra (&quot;Dacelo novaeguineae&quot;), pied currawong (&quot;Strepera graculina&quot;), red goshawk (&quot;Erythrotriorchis radiatus&quot;), marbled frogmouth (&quot;Podargus ocellatus&quot;), bush-hen (&quot;Amaurornis olivacea&quot;), black-breasted button quail (&quot;Turnix melanogaster&quot;), white-bellied sea eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus leucogaster&quot;), comb-crested jacana (&quot;Irediparra gallinacea&quot;) and cotton pygmy goose (&quot;Nettapus coromandelianus&quot;).

66 mammal species have been recorded in the park, including the echidna (&quot;Tachyglossus aculeatus&quot;), platypus (&quot;Ornithorhynchus anatinus&quot;), red-necked pademelon (&quot;Thylogale thetis&quot;), short-eared possum (&quot;Trichosurus caninus&quot;), common ringtail possum (&quot;Pseudocheirus peregrinus&quot;), northern brown bandicoot (&quot;Isoodon macrourus&quot;), long-nosed bandicoot (&quot;Perameles nasuta&quot;), Long-nosed potoroo (&quot;Potorous tridactylus&quot;), insectivorous bats, fruit bats (&quot;flying foxes&quot;) (&quot;Pteropus &quot;spp.), several species of gliding possums and small numbers of koalas (&quot;Phascolarctos cinereus&quot;) and kangaroos.

There are a variety of reptile species in the park. This includes the tree goanna/lace monitor (&quot;Varanus varius&quot;), which is a large monitor lizard and the land mullet (&quot;Egernia major&quot;), which is a large, shiny black skink. 26 species of frogs have been recorded in the park, including the great barred frog (&quot;Mixophyes fasciolatus&quot;). The most common amphibian in the park is an introduced pest, the cane toad (&quot;Rhinella marina&quot;).

<text>The Daintree National Park is located in Far North Queensland, Australia, northwest of Brisbane and northwest of Cairns. It was founded in 1981 and is part of the Wet Tropics of Queensland. In 1988, it became a World Heritage Site. The park consists of two sections—Mossman Gorge and Cape Tribulation, with a settled agricultural area between them which includes the towns of Mossman and Daintree Village.

One entrance to Daintree National Park is located south of the Daintree River at Mossman Gorge where a visitor centre has been built from where tourists take a shuttle bus to the gorge, where they can take a walk or a refreshing swim.

The most spectacular and oldest part of the Daintree Rainforest is north of the Daintree River. After crossing the river on an old fashioned cable ferry there is a range of boardwalks and untouched beaches to explore, and the endangered cassowary can be encountered anywhere.

Daintree National Park is valued because of its exceptional biodiversity. It contains significant habitat for rare species and prolific birdlife. The name is derived from the Daintree River, which was named by George Elphinstone Dalrymple, an early explorer of the area, after his friend Richard Daintree.

In 2021, a historic deal made with the Queensland government has led to the eastern Kuku Yalanji people taking formal ownership of Daintree National Park.

==Mossman Gorge section==

The Great Dividing Range is close to the coast in this region. This section covers of mostly inaccessible rainforests and mountain woodlands. The popular Mossman Gorge is located in the southern part of the park. Located north of Cairns via the Captain Cook Highway and Mossman, the gorge offers many scenic exploration walks including Baral Marrjanga, Lower river track, Rex Creek bridge, and the Rainforest circuit track. It is inhabited by incredible flora and fauna including Boyd’s forest dragon and Victoria’s riflebird.

==Cape Tribulation section==
Cape Tribulation also lies in the park. Originally the cape belonged to Cape Tribulation National Park from 1981 but was amalgamated into Daintree National Park in 1983. This section covers including the coastal range (Thornton Peak, Mt Hemmant, and Mt Sorrow, going north from the Daintree river) and contains Australia&#x27;s last extensive stands of lowland rainforest. It has extensive (and relatively) unspoiled beaches from Thornton Beach to Cape Tribulation beach – fringed with the increasingly rare littoral (beachside) rainforest. The Daintree river is the southern boundary for the region - reinforced by the need to take a cable ferry across the Daintree river. Much of the coastal flatlands, especially to the south of the Alexandra range, and in Cow Bay, were cleared for agriculture in the late 1800s with a major clearing push in the 1970s. A lot of this has since recovered or has been settled.

The Daintree National Park&#x27;s traditional owners are the Eastern Kuku Yalanji Aboriginal people. Many of the natural features of the landscape hold spiritual significance for the traditional owners. One of these features is the location of the bouncing stones at Thornton Beach. The rocks here are hornfels, metamorphic rocks resulting from the effects of a major intrusion of granite that produced the coastal mountains. They are very elastic, when bounced on the local rock pavement; The park contains the Mossman River to the south, the Daintree River and the Bloomfield River to the north.

=== Geography ===
This section of the park includes the entirety of the Dagmar locality, in the Shire of Douglas, Queensland. The section also includes the northern and eastern parts of the adjacent Noah locality.

==== Dagmar ====

The Daintree River forms the locality of Dagmar&#x27;s north-eastern, northern, and north-western boundaries, while the Daintree Range loosely forms its southern boundary.

The locality takes its name from the &quot;Heights of Dagmar&quot; (now the Dagmar Range), which was named by explorer George Elphinstone Dalrymple in his 1873 exploration of the North East Coast of Queensland. In his report to the Queensland Parliament, Dalrymyple described the range as &quot;jungle-clad hills&quot; but he provided no explanation as to the choice of name. Others have claimed he so named it because of a resemblance to the Dagmar Cross. Dalyrmple described the land from the range down to the Daintree River as &quot;luxuriant jungles, filling all the broad valley, and giving evidence of many thousands of acres of the same rich agricultural lands ... soon to be the gem of Australia&quot;, prophesying that agriculture rather than mining would be the longterm feature of the Queensland economy.

Another of the expedition members, Robert Johnstone (a sub-inspector in the Queensland Police Force) climbed to the top of the Heights of Dagmar, describing the range as &quot;fine open grassy hills of good soil; the extent of rich jungle land is very extensive&quot;. Another expedition member Walter Hill (a botanist) described the soil &quot;first class&quot; and identified a new species of coconut palm. Hill also expressed the view that the land around the upper Daintree River would be able to support a large population, noting it would be suitable for the cultivation of sugarcane and other tropical crops as well as for grazing land. He also believed the Daintree River would be an effective transport route to the Palmer goldfields to the west.

In April 1886 Queensland Government offered land for sale in Dagmar, 4 parcels of each, followed by further land sales and pastoral leases. By 1894, a number of blocks of land had been sold along the Daintree River in the south-east of the present boundaries of the locality.

In 1942 the Queensland Government set aside land in Dagmar to create a reserve as a source of timber (later known as the Dagmar State Forest). The timber reserve appears on a 1950 map.

=== Noah ===

The northern and eastern parts of the locality of Noah are within the Daintree National Park.

The south-western part is undeveloped land.

==Flora==
Much of the national park is covered by tropical rainforest. The Greater Daintree Rainforest has existed continuously for more than 110 million years, making it possibly the oldest existing rainforest.
The persistence of this rainforest is believed to be a product of a fortuitous continental drift; after the breakup of its parent supercontinent a portion drifted toward the pole to become Antarctica, disturbing ocean currents and becoming quite chilly, while other portions were moved to hotter and drier locations. The rainforests of the parent continent preserved its climate, and so also its original trees. Tree species, once thought to be long extinct, have only relatively recently been discovered here.

==Fauna==

The park supports more than 430 bird species. The wompoo fruit-dove is one of six species of pigeon that live in the park as well as significant populations of the endangered cassowary, a flightless bird of substantial size. The buff-breasted paradise kingfisher is a seasonal visitor. Mammals include the striped possum, Daintree River ringtail possum, brown bandicoot, long-nosed bandicoot, musky rat-kangaroo, Bennett’s tree kangaroo, swamp wallaby, platypus and short-beaked echidna. At least 23 species of reptile and 13 species of amphibian can be found in the park. Among the reptiles present are Boyd&#x27;s forest dragon, eastern water dragon, chameleon gecko, northern leaf-tailed gecko, the scrub or amethystine python, keelback, and the green and northern tree snakes. Frogs found in the park include the Australian lacelid, white-lipped treefrog, colourful-eyed treefrog and common mist frog. The introduced cane toad is also present in the park.

<doc id="103264" wikidata="Q1158073" url="?curid=103264" title="Dalrymple National Park">
<text>Dalrymple is a national park in Queensland, Australia, 1108 km northwest of Brisbane.

The park has unique features such as ancient lava flows and the Burdekin River, the largest river in Queensland. This is the land of Gudjal Aboriginal people.

Among the interesting animals can be found here, bridled nailtail wallaby, greater glider and koala.

The elevation of the terrain is 275 metres above sea level.

== History ==
Remains of the old town of Dalrymple can be seen on the west bank of the Burdekin River. Built in 1864, it was the first inland town in the former British colony of North Australia. With the discovery of gold on the Cape River in 1867 and the Gilbert River in 1869, the town grew from a simple tent camp to a thriving town with five hotels and numerous stores. In 1870, however, a flood destroyed large parts of the town, and this and further gold discoveries near Ravenswood and Charters Towers led to its decline. In 1901, 34 years after the town was founded, only a few relics, such as the cemetery, fences and old mine shafts, still bore witness to its existence.

== Landscape ==
Dalrymple National Park was established to protect important geological formations that were created 2.4 million years ago. Basalt, limestone and sandstone can be found in the immediate vicinity. North of the Burdekin River, the 380-metre-high Mount Keelbottom rises 130 meters above the surrounding flatlands. To the southwest of the river are three lava flows, the youngest dating back to the eruption of the Toomba volcano 13,000 years ago, the two older layers dating back 1.3 million and 2.4 million years respectively. Some of the streams in the park, such as Fletcher and Lolworth Creek, have dug deep through the different layers of rock. In some places, basalt columns can be found on one bank of the creek, while 385-million-year-old coral limestone with numerous Devonian fossils can be found on the other.

<text>Davies Creek National Park is in Far North Queensland, Australia, 1,392 km northwest of Brisbane, 20 km south west of Cairns. The park is located on the Atherton Tableland within the Barron River water catchment. It lies within the Einasleigh Uplands and Wet Tropics of Queensland bioregions.

It is picturesque with its granite outcrops, the Davies Creek Falls and open eucalypt woodland. Davies Creek raises in the Lamb Range and eventually flows into the Barron River. The park is important as a preserve of the northern bettong, an endangered species. A total of five rare or threatened species have been identified in the park. One of them is the bettong (rat-kangaroo) whose main population lives in this park. The world&#x27;s largest bird-eating and barking spiders have been observed here, measuring up to 16 cm in diameter.

==Access==
The park can be reached on the Kennedy Highway 21 km southwest of Kuranda.

==Facilities==
There is a picnic area beside the creek with toilets available. The water of the creek must be boiled for at least five minutes before drinking it. There is a two km walking trail upstream that leads to the base of Davies Creek Falls.

Camping is permitted. Permits must be obtained and fees paid before arrival.

<doc id="103266" wikidata="Q1182459" url="?curid=103266" title="Deepwater National Park">
<text>Deepwater is a coastal national park in Queensland, Australia, 375 km north of Brisbane. It protects an area of sand dunes and coastal heaths in the Deepwater Creek catchment. The area is one of the few remaining pristine freshwater catchments on Queensland&#x27;s east coast. Deepwater National Park was established in 1988 and covers 4,090 ha.

The north of the park is dominated by a 70 m high sand dune which is covered in vegetation. There are some scattered rocky outcrops of volcanic origin including a number of rocky headlands along the park&#x27;s 9 km of beach frontage.

==Flora and fauna==
Vegetation in the park is varied between the seaward and landward side of the high dune. To the east are typical beach plants, on the exposed higher areas the plants appear wind-sheared and to the west in more protected area taller vegetation has formed up to three canopy levels of forest and woodlands.

Beaches in the park are used for nesting by loggerhead and leatherback turtles. Flatback and green turtles also nest on the park&#x27;s beaches. This location is the only mainland site where leatherbacks repeatedly return to lay eggs.

Rose-crowned fruit doves, fairy gerygones and grey fantails are commonly found in the canopies to the west. Along the beaches pied oystercatcher, bar-tailed godwits, tattlers and crested terns are often seen. Emus and brahminy kites can also be found in the park.

Queensland&#x27;s largest cockroach &quot;Macro-panesthia sp.&quot; is found in the park.

== Facilities ==
Camping facilities, pit toilets and picnic tables are located at Wreck Rock, 5.5 km north of the park&#x27;s southern boundary. A second camp site is located further north at Middle Rock, however there are no facilities here. Picnic facilities for day visitors is provided at Flat Rock.

No domestic animals or open fires are permitted in the park.

== Access ==
The park is accessible from the south through Wartburg. Conventional vehicle access possible in the dry season only. Alternative access is possible from the north through Agnes Water. A 4WD vehicle is recommended for this route due to sandy conditions and the slope.

<text>Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin ( ; 1 March 1812 – 14 September 1852) was an English architect, designer, artist and critic with French and Swiss origins. He is principally remembered for his pioneering role in the Gothic Revival style of architecture. His work culminated in designing the interior of the Palace of Westminster in Westminster, London, and its renowned clock tower, the Elizabeth Tower (formerly St. Stephen&#x27;s Tower), which houses the bell known as Big Ben. Pugin designed many churches in England, and some in Ireland and Australia. He was the son of Auguste Pugin, and the father of Edward Welby Pugin, Cuthbert Welby Pugin, and Peter Paul Pugin, who continued his architectural and interior design firm as Pugin &amp; Pugin.

==Biography==


Pugin was the son of the French draughtsman Auguste Pugin, who had immigrated to England as a result of the French Revolution and had married Catherine Welby of the Welby family of Denton, Lincolnshire, England. Pugin was born on 1 March 1812 at his parents&#x27; house in Bloomsbury, London, England. Between 1821 and 1838, Pugin&#x27;s father published a series of volumes of architectural drawings, the first two entitled &quot;Specimens of Gothic Architecture&quot; and the following three &quot;Examples of Gothic Architecture&quot;, that not only remained in print but were the standard references for Gothic architecture for at least the next century.

===Religion===
As a child, his mother took Pugin each Sunday to the services of the fashionable Scottish Presbyterian preacher Edward Irving (later the founder of the Holy Catholic Apostolic Church), at his chapel in Cross Street, Hatton Garden, Camden, London. Pugin quickly rebelled against this version of Christianity: according to Benjamin Ferrey, Pugin &quot;always expressed unmitigated disgust at the cold and sterile forms of the Scottish church; and the moment he broke free from the trammels imposed on him by his mother, he rushed into the arms of a church which, pompous by its ceremonies, was attractive to his imaginative mind&quot;.

===Education and early ventures===
Pugin learned drawing from his father, and for a while attended Christ&#x27;s Hospital. After leaving school, he worked in his father&#x27;s office, and in 1825 and 1827 accompanied him on visits to France. His first commissions independent of his father were for designs for the goldsmiths Rundell and Bridge, and for designs for furniture of Windsor Castle from the upholsterers Morel and Seddon. Through a contact made while working at Windsor, he became interested in the design of theatrical scenery, and in 1831 obtained a commission to design the sets for the production of the new opera &quot;Kenilworth&quot; at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. He also developed an interest in sailing, and briefly commanded a small merchant schooner trading between Great Britain and Holland, which allowed him to import examples of furniture and carving from Flanders, with which he later furnished his house at Ramsgate in Kent. During one voyage in 1830, he was wrecked on the Scottish coast near Leith, as a result of which he came into contact with Edinburgh architect James Gillespie Graham, who advised him to abandon seafaring for architecture. He then established a business supplying historically accurate carved wood and stone detailing for the increasing number of buildings being constructed in the Gothic Revival style, but the enterprise quickly failed.

===Marriages===
In 1831, at the age of 19, Pugin married the first of his three wives, Anne Garnet. She died a few months later in childbirth, leaving him a daughter. He had a further six children, including the future architect Edward Welby Pugin, with his second wife, Louisa Burton, who died in 1844. His third wife, Jane Knill, kept a journal of their marital life, from their marriage in 1848 to Pugin&#x27;s death, which was later published. Their son was the architect Peter Paul Pugin.

===Salisbury===
Following his second marriage in 1833, Pugin moved to Salisbury, Wiltshire, with his wife, and in 1835 bought of land in Alderbury, about outside the town. On this, he built a Gothic Revival-style house for his family, which he named St Marie&#x27;s Grange. Of it, Charles Eastlake said &quot;he had not yet learned the art of combining a picturesque exterior with the ordinary comforts of an English home&quot;.

===Conversion to Catholicism===
In 1834, Pugin converted to Catholicism and was received into it the following year.

British society at the start of the 19th century often discriminated against dissenters from the Church of England, although things began to change during Pugin&#x27;s lifetime, helping to make Pugin&#x27;s eventual conversion to Catholicism more socially acceptable. For example, dissenters could not take degrees at the established universities of Oxford and Cambridge until 1871, but the University of London (later renamed University College London) was founded near Pugin&#x27;s birthplace in 1826 with the express purpose of educating dissenters to degree standard (although it would not be able to confer degrees until 1836). Dissenters were also unable to serve on parish or city councils, be a member of Parliament, serve in the armed forces or be on a jury. A number of reforms across the 19th century relieved these restrictions, one of which was the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, which allowed Catholics to become members of Parliament.

Pugin&#x27;s conversion acquainted him with new patrons and employers. In 1832 he made the acquaintance of John Talbot, 16th Earl of Shrewsbury, a Catholic sympathetic to his aesthetic theory and who employed him in alterations and additions to his residence of Alton Towers, which subsequently led to many more commissions. Shrewsbury commissioned him to build St Giles Catholic Church, Cheadle, Staffordshire, which was completed in 1846, and Pugin was also responsible for designing the oldest Catholic Church in Shropshire, St Peter and Paul Church, Newport.

===&quot;Contrasts&quot;===
In 1836, Pugin published &quot;Contrasts&quot;, a polemical book which argued for the revival of the medieval Gothic style, and also &quot;a return to the faith and the social structures of the Middle Ages&quot;. The book was prompted by the passage of the Church Building Acts of 1818 and 1824, the former of which is often called the Million Pound Act due to the appropriation amount by Parliament for the construction of new Anglican churches in Britain. The new churches constructed from these funds, many of them in a Gothic Revival style due to the assertion that it was the &quot;cheapest&quot; style to use, were often criticised by Pugin and many others for their shoddy design and workmanship and poor liturgical standards relative to an authentic Gothic structure.

Each plate in &quot;Contrasts&quot; selected a type of urban building and contrasted the 1830 example with its 15th-century equivalent. In one example, Pugin contrasted a medieval monastic foundation, where monks fed and clothed the needy, grew food in the gardens – and gave the dead a decent burial – with &quot;a panopticon workhouse where the poor were beaten, half-starved and sent off after death for dissection. Each structure was the built expression of a particular view of humanity: Christianity versus Utilitarianism.&quot; Pugin&#x27;s biographer, Rosemary Hill, wrote: &quot;The drawings were all calculatedly unfair. King&#x27;s College London was shown from an unflatteringly skewed angle, while Christ Church, Oxford, was edited to avoid showing its famous Tom Tower because that was by Christopher Wren and so not medieval. But the cumulative rhetorical force was tremendous.&quot;

In 1841 he published his illustrated &quot;The True Principles of Pointed or Christian Architecture&quot;, which was premised on his two fundamental principles of Christian architecture. He conceived of &quot;Christian architecture&quot; as synonymous with medieval, &quot;Gothic&quot;, or &quot;pointed&quot;, architecture. In the work, he also wrote that contemporary craftsmen seeking to emulate the style of medieval workmanship should reproduce its methods.

===Ramsgate===
In 1841 he left Salisbury, having found it an inconvenient base for his growing architectural practice. He sold St Marie&#x27;s Grange at a considerable financial loss, and moved temporarily to Cheyne Walk in Chelsea, London. He had, however, already purchased a parcel of land at West Cliff, Ramsgate, Thanet in Kent, where he proceeded to build for himself a large house and, at his own expense, a church dedicated to St Augustine, after whom he thought himself named. He worked on this church whenever funds permitted it. His second wife died in 1844 and was buried at St Chad&#x27;s Cathedral, Birmingham, which he had designed.

===Architectural commissions===
Following the destruction by fire of the Palace of Westminster in Westminster, London, in 1834, Pugin was employed by Sir Charles Barry to supply interior designs for his entry to the architectural competition which would determine who would build the new Palace of Westminster. Pugin also supplied drawings for the entry of James Gillespie Graham. This followed a period of employment when Pugin had worked with Barry on the interior design of King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham. Despite his conversion to Catholicism in 1834, Pugin designed and refurbished both Anglican and Catholic churches throughout England.

Other works include St. Chad&#x27;s Cathedral, Erdington Abbey, and Oscott College, all in Birmingham, England. He also designed the collegiate buildings of St Patrick and St Mary in St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth, Ireland; though not the collegiate chapel. His original plans included both a chapel and an &quot;aula maxima&quot; (great hall), neither of which were built because of financial constraints. The college chapel was designed by a follower of Pugin, the Irish architect James Joseph McCarthy. Also in Ireland, Pugin designed St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Killarney (1842-45), St Aidan&#x27;s Cathedral in Enniscorthy (renovated in 1996), and the Dominican Church of the Holy Cross in Tralee. He revised the plans for St Michael&#x27;s Church, Ballinasloe, County Galway, Ireland. Bishop William Wareing also invited Pugin to design what eventually became Northampton Cathedral, a project that was completed in 1864 by one of Pugin&#x27;s sons, Edward Welby Pugin.

Pugin visited Italy in 1847; his experience there confirmed his dislike of Renaissance and Baroque architecture, but he found much to admire in the medieval art of northern Italy.

=== Stained glass ===
Pugin was a prolific designer of stained glass. He worked with Thomas Willement, William Warrington and William Wailes before persuading his friend John Hardman to start stained glass production.

===Illness and death===

In February 1852, while travelling with his son Edward by train, Pugin had a total breakdown and arrived in London unable to recognise anyone or speak coherently. For four months he was confined to a private asylum, Kensington House. In June, he was transferred to the Royal Bethlem Hospital, popularly known as Bedlam. At that time, Bethlem Hospital was opposite St George&#x27;s Cathedral, Southwark, one of Pugin&#x27;s major buildings, where he had married his third wife, Jane, in 1848. Jane and a doctor removed Pugin from Bedlam and took him to a private house in Hammersmith where they attempted therapy, and he recovered sufficiently to recognise his wife. In September, Jane took her husband back to The Grange in Ramsgate, where he died on 14 September 1852. He is buried in his church next to The Grange, St. Augustine&#x27;s.
On Pugin&#x27;s death certificate, the cause listed was &quot;convulsions followed by coma&quot;. Pugin&#x27;s biographer, Rosemary Hill, suggests that, in the last year of his life, he had had hyperthyroidism which would account for his symptoms of exaggerated appetite, perspiration, and restlessness. Hill writes that Pugin&#x27;s medical history, including eye problems and recurrent illness from his early twenties, suggests that he contracted syphilis in his late teens, and this may have been the cause of his death at the age of 40.

==Palace of Westminster==
In October 1834, the Palace of Westminster burned down. Subsequently, the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, wanted, now that he was premier, to disassociate himself from the controversial John Wilson Croker, who was a founding member of the Athenaeum Club; a close associate of the pre-eminent neoclassical architects James Burton and Decimus Burton; an advocate of neoclassicism; and a repudiator of the gothic revival style. Consequently, Peel appointed a committee chaired by Edward Cust, a detester of the style of John Nash and William Wilkins, which resolved that the new Houses of Parliament would have to be in either the &#x27;gothic&#x27; or the &#x27;Elizabethan&#x27; style. Augustus W.N. Pugin, the foremost expert on the Gothic, had to submit each of his designs through, and thus in the name of, other architects, Gillespie-Graham and Charles Barry, because he had recently openly and fervently converted to Catholicism, as a consequence of which any design submitted in his own name would certainly have been automatically rejected; the design he submitted for improvements to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1843 were rejected for this reason. The design for Parliament that Pugin submitted through Barry won the competition. Subsequent to the announcement of the design ascribed to Barry, William Richard Hamilton, who had been secretary to Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin during the acquisition of the Elgin Marbles, published a pamphlet in which he censured the fact that &#x27;gothic barbarism&#x27; had been preferred to the masterful designs of Ancient Greece and Rome: but the judgement was not altered, and was ratified by the Commons and the Lords. The commissioners subsequently appointed Pugin to assist in the construction of the interior of the new Palace, to the design of which Pugin himself had been the foremost determiner. Pugin&#x27;s biographer, Rosemary Hill, shows that Barry designed the Palace as a whole, and only he could co-ordinate such a large project and deal with its difficult paymasters, but he relied entirely on Pugin for its Gothic interiors, wallpapers and furnishings. The first stone of the new Pugin-Barry design was laid on 27 April 1840.

During the competition for the design of the new Houses of Parliament, Decimus Burton, &#x27;the land&#x27;s leading classicist&#x27;, was vituperated with continuous invective, which Guy Williams has described as an &#x27;anti-Burton campaign&#x27;, by the foremost advocate of the neo-gothic style, Augustus W.N. Pugin, who was made enviously reproachful that Decimus &quot;had done much more than Pugin&#x27;s father (Augustus Charles Pugin) to alter the appearance of London&quot;. Pugin attempted to popularize advocacy of the neo-gothic, and repudiation of the neoclassical, by composing and illustrating books that contended the supremacy of the former and the degeneracy of the latter, which were published from 1835. In 1845, Pugin, in his &quot;Contrasts: or a Parallel Between the Noble Edifices of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries and Similar Buildings of the Present Day&quot;, which the author had to publish himself as a consequence of the extent of the defamation of society architects therein, satirized John Nash as &quot;Mr Wash, Plasterer, who jobs out Day Work on Moderate Terms&quot;, and Decimus Burton as &quot;Talent of No Consequence, Premium Required&quot;, and included satirical sketches of Nash&#x27;s Buckingham Palace and Burton&#x27;s Wellington Arch. Consequently, the number of commissions received by Decimus declined, although Decimus retained a close friendship with the aristocrats amongst his patrons, who continued to commission him.

At the end of Pugin&#x27;s life, in February 1852, Barry visited him in Ramsgate and Pugin supplied a detailed design for the iconic Palace clock tower, in 2012 dubbed the Elizabeth Tower but popularly known as Big Ben. The design is very close to earlier designs by Pugin, including an unbuilt scheme for Scarisbrick Hall, Lancashire. The tower was Pugin&#x27;s last design before descending into madness. In her biography, Hill quotes Pugin as writing of what is probably his best-known building: &quot;I never worked so hard in my life [as] for Mr Barry for tomorrow I render all the designs for finishing his bell tower &amp; it is beautiful &amp; I am the whole machinery of the clock.&quot; Hill writes that Barry omitted to give any credit to Pugin for his huge contribution to the design of the new Houses of Parliament. In 1867, after the deaths of both Pugin and Barry, Pugin&#x27;s son Edward published a pamphlet, &quot;Who Was the Art Architect of the Houses of Parliament, a statement of facts&quot;, in which he asserted that his father was the &quot;true&quot; architect of the building and not Barry.

==Pugin in Ireland==

Pugin was invited to Ireland by the Redmond family, initially to work in County Wexford. He arrived in Ireland in 1838 at a time of greater religious tolerance, when Catholic churches were permitted to be built. Most of his work in Ireland consisted of religious buildings. Pugin demanded the highest quality of workmanship from his craftsmen, particularly the stonemasons. His subsequent visits to the country were brief and infrequent. He was the main architect of St Aidan&#x27;s Cathedral for the Diocese of Ferns in Enniscorthy, County Wexford. Pugin was the architect of the Russell Library at St. Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynoooth, although he did not live to see its completion. Pugin provided the initial design of St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Killarney.

==Pugin and Australia==
The first Catholic Bishop of New South Wales, Australia, John Bede Polding, met Pugin and was present when St Chad&#x27;s Cathedral, Birmingham and St Giles&#x27; Catholic Church, Cheadle were officially opened. Although Pugin never visited Australia, Polding persuaded Pugin to design a series of churches for him. Although a number of churches do not survive, St. Francis Xavier&#x27;s in Berrima, New South Wales, is regarded as a fine example of a Pugin church. Polding blessed the foundation stone in February 1849, and the church was completed in 1851.

St. Stephen&#x27;s Chapel, now in the cathedral grounds in Elizabeth Street, Brisbane, was built to a design by Pugin. Construction began in 1848, and the first Mass in the church was celebrated on 12 May 1850. In 1859 James Quinn was appointed Bishop of Brisbane, Brisbane became a diocese, and Pugin&#x27;s small church became a cathedral. When the new Cathedral of St Stephen was opened in 1874 the small Pugin church became a schoolroom, and later church offices and storage room. It was threatened with demolition several times before its restoration in the 1990s. In Sydney, there are several altered examples of his work, namely St. Benedict&#x27;s, Chippendale; St Charles Borromeo, Ryde; the former church of St Augustine of Hippo (next to the existing church), Balmain; and St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Parramatta, which was gutted by a fire in 1996.

According to Steve Meacham writing in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, Pugin&#x27;s legacy in Australia is particularly of the idea of what a church should look like:

After his death, Pugin&#x27;s two sons, Edward Pugin and Peter Pugin, continued operating their father&#x27;s architectural firm under the name Pugin &amp; Pugin. Their work includes most of the &quot;Pugin&quot; buildings in Australia and New Zealand.

==Reputation and influence==
Charles Eastlake, writing in 1872, noted that the quality of construction in Pugin&#x27;s buildings was often poor, and believed he was lacking in technical knowledge, his strength lying more in his facility as a designer of architectural detail.

Pugin&#x27;s legacy began to fade immediately after his death. This was partly due to the hostility of John Ruskin. Ruskin wrote of Pugin, &quot;he is not a great architect but one of the smallest possible or conceivable architects&quot;. Contemporaries and admirers of Pugin, including Sir Henry Cole, protested at the viciousness of the attack and pointed out that Ruskin&#x27;s idea on style had much in common with Pugin&#x27;s. After Pugin&#x27;s death, Ruskin &quot;outlived and out-talked him by half a century&quot;. Sir Kenneth Clark wrote, &quot;If Ruskin had never lived, Pugin would never have been forgotten.&quot;
Nonetheless, Pugin&#x27;s architectural ideas were carried forward by two young architects who admired him and had attended his funeral, W. E. Nesfield and Norman Shaw. George Gilbert Scott, William Butterfield, and George Edmund Street were influenced by Pugin&#x27;s designs, and continued to work out the implication of ideas he had sketched in his writings. In Street&#x27;s office, Philip Webb met William Morris and they went on to become leading members of the English Arts and Crafts Movement. Morris regarded Pugin as a prominent figure in the &quot;first act&quot; of the Gothic revival, in which it &quot;triumphed as an exotic ecclesiastical style&quot;, whereas in the second act, Ruskin replaced specific religious connotations with a universal, ethical stance. When the German critic Hermann Muthesius published his admiring and influential study of English domestic architecture, Pugin was all but invisible, yet &quot;it was he ... who invented the English House that Muthesius so admired&quot;.

An armoire that he designed (crafted by frequent collaborator John Gregory Crace) is held at the Victoria and Albert Museum. It was shown at The Great Exhibition of 1851 but was not eligible for a medal, as it was shown under Crace&#x27;s name and he was a judge for the Furniture Class at the exhibition.

On 23 February 2012 the Royal Mail released a first-class stamp featuring Pugin as part of its &quot;Britons of Distinction&quot; series. The stamp image depicts an interior view of the Palace of Westminster. Also in 2012, the BBC broadcast an arts documentary programme on Pugin&#x27;s achievements.

===Railway cottages===
Less grand than the above are the railway cottages at Windermere station in Cumbria which have been loosely attributed to Pugin or a follower. Believed to date from 1849, and probably some of the first houses to be built in Windermere, the terrace of cottages was built for railway executives. One of the fireplaces is a copy of one of his in the Palace of Westminster.

<text>Diamantina National Park is a national park in the Channel Country of South West Queensland, Australia, west of Brisbane. Like the Diamantina River that flows through it, it is named for Lady Diamantina Bowen, wife of Sir George Bowen, the first Governor of Queensland.

Established in 1993 after the Queensland Government purchased Diamantina Lakes Station in 1992 and gazetted the property as a national park with an area of , Diamantina National Park received an award in March 2007 from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) for being among the top 10 reserves of the decade. Recognition was given for the successful efforts to protect the bilby, an endangered mammal native to Australia.

Livestock was removed from the park in 1998.

Parts of the park contain traditional aboriginal lands. These are noted for their food resources and numerous habitation sites. Aboriginals would roam the area, moving from the sandhills and gibber country in the wet season and returning to permanent water in the dry season.

Average elevations of the terrain is 139 metres.

==Birds==
With Astrebla Downs National Park, Diamantina National Park forms part of the Diamantina and Astrebla Grasslands Important Bird Area, identified by BirdLife International as such because it is one of few sites known for the critically endangered night parrot. It also supports globally important populations of the plains-wanderer, Australian bustard, straw-necked ibis, white-necked heron, inland dotterel, Bourke&#x27;s parrot, black and pied honeyeaters, gibberbird, Hall&#x27;s babbler, chestnut-breasted quail-thrush, cinnamon quail-thrush and spinifexbird.

In 2016, a population of the critically endangered night parrot was discovered in the park. The parrot is Australia&#x27;s rarest bird species. This discovery significantly expanded the known range and is the largest known population of the species.

The park covers an area of . It lies within the Mooloolah River water catchment area of the South East Queensland bioregion.

The park features the heritage-listed Dularcha railway tunnel which was built in 1891. The park was initially declared so as to ensure rail passengers were provided a decent view of Queensland&#x27;s forest. Use of the tunnel halted in 1932 when the line was moved to the east. The tunnel now serves as a seasonal lodge for a variety of small bats, including large-footed myotis. The park was extended in 2010 when Mooloolah Forest Reserve was added to the national park.

The park contains a riverine wetland covering . A total of nine rare of threatened species have been identified within the park.

Dularcha National Park has a mild subtropical climate.

<doc id="103272" wikidata="Q977942" url="?curid=103272" title="Girramay National Park">
<text>Girramay is a national park in Queensland, Australia, 1269 km northwest of Brisbane. The national park is part of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area. 

The park protects part of the coastline between the mouths of the Tully River and Meunga Creek at Rockingham Bay. Waters adjacent to the park belong to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.

==Flora==
The coastal plain contains mangrove and freshwater swamps associated with the waterways of Murray River, Dallachy Creek and Wreck Creek. Other vegetation types include low coastal rainforest, eucalyptus forest, melaleuca woodland and sedge swamp. The Arenga palm grows here, one of only a few Australian mainland locations where this occurs. The Red Beech, pandanus and melaleucas are typically found in the park.

==Fauna==
The endangered southern cassowary and mahogany glider are found in the park. Saltwater crocodiles are found in the creeks. The park is part of the Coastal Wet Tropics Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for the conservation of lowland tropical rainforest birds. Common birds include the black butcherbird and various honeyeaters. The orange-footed scrubfowl nests in the park. Their mounds, which can be up to three m high, are the largest of all mound-building birds in Australia. Lace monitor lizards can also be seen in Girramay National Park.

Feral pigs and cattle have to be culled from the area.

==History==
The land was once home to the Girramay people. In 1848, explorer Edmund Kennedy and his party landed 35 km north of the park. He travelled south through the area now known as Girramay National Park in a failed attempt to find passage over the ranges behind the coast. 

The Edmund Kennedy National Park was established in 1977. It was expanded in 1980 by land donated by conservation activists Margaret and Arthur Thorsborne.

In 2009, Edmund Kennedy National Park was, along with the Murray Upper National Park, subsumed into the Girramay National Park.

In 2011, Cyclone Yasi caused significant damage to the area.

==Facilities==
Camping is not permitted in the park. Picnic facilities including tables and toilets are available. A boardwalk through mangroves and another along Wreck Creek are graded as easy.

==Access==
The park can be reached by an entrance road four km north of Cardwell on the Bruce Highway.

<doc id="103273" wikidata="Q311613" url="?curid=103273" title="Michael Rosenbaum">
<text>Michael Rosenbaum (born July 11, 1972) is an American actor and podcaster. He is known for portraying Lex Luthor on the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;, a role that &quot;TV Guide&quot; included in their 2013 list of &quot;The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time&quot;.

Rosenbaum is also known for portraying Martinex in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot; and &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot;, Parker in &quot;Urban Legend&quot;, Adam/Adina in &quot;Sorority Boys&quot; and Dutch Nilbog on Fox&#x27;s &quot;Breaking In&quot;. He also has an extensive voiceover career in animation, such as his role of Wally West / The Flash in the DC Animated Universe series &quot;Justice League&quot; (2001–2004) and its sequel &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; (2004–2006). Between 2015 and 2016, he played the lead role in the TV Land comedy series &quot;Impastor&quot;.

He is also the lead singer of the band Sun Spin with his friend Rob Danson. The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Best Days&quot; was released on February 9, 2021.

==Early life==
Rosenbaum was born in Oceanside, New York and raised in Newburgh, Indiana. His mother, Julie (née Eckstein), is a writer and his father, Mark Rosenbaum, worked in pharmaceuticals. He is one of six children with two brothers, Eric and Adam, and a sister, Laurie. After his parents&#x27; divorce, his mother remarried sports reporter Gordon Engelhardt, and his father remarried Alexis Pelegrino, with whom he had two daughters, Rosenbaum&#x27;s half-sisters. His uncle is pet behaviorist Warren Eckstein. Rosenbaum is Jewish, and says he was &quot;closer to religion&quot; in New York than in Indiana.

Rosenbaum graduated from Castle High School in Newburgh, Indiana and from Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, Kentucky with a degree in theatre arts. Immediately after, he moved to New York City to pursue an acting career.

==Career==

In 2001, Rosenbaum received a Saturn Award for his portrayal of Lex Luthor on &quot;Smallville&quot;. Continuing in the superhero genre, he played Wally West (a.k.a. the Flash) in the DC Comics animated series &quot;Justice League&quot;, &quot;Static Shock&quot;, and &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, as well as portraying a younger version of Wally West as Kid Flash in &quot;Teen Titans&quot;. In the third season &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; episode &quot;The Great Brain Robbery&quot;, Rosenbaum reprised his role as Lex Luthor when Wally and Lex Luthor temporarily switched bodies. In February 2008, Rosenbaum confirmed that he would be leaving &quot;Smallville&quot; after the seventh season. After many months of speculation and him first turning down the contract to return, it was announced on February 11, 2011 that Rosenbaum would return to &quot;Smallville&quot; for the two-hour series finale, which aired on May 13, 2011, with Rosenbaum reprising his role as Lex Luthor.

In 2012, Rosenbaum appeared in &quot;Hit and Run&quot;, which starred Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell. Rosenbaum portrayed the character Gil, a jealous ex-boyfriend from Annie&#x27;s (Bell&#x27;s character) past.

Rosenbaum provided the voice work for Ghoul and Deadshot in the animated DCAU film &quot;Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker&quot;. Rosenbaum filmed the original SyFy comedy series &quot;Saved By Zeroes&quot;; yet was never picked up. He recurred in Fox&#x27;s original sitcom &quot;Breaking In&quot;; the show was cancelled initially after the first season but got a second chance, and Rosenbaum was promoted to series regular. The series was cancelled again after a few episodes of the second season.

In 2014, Rosenbaum made his feature-film directorial and writing debut with the comedy &quot;Back in the Day&quot;, starring as an actor who returns to his hometown in Indiana for a class reunion. The film was filmed in Newburgh and Evansville, Indiana. Prior to the production of &quot;Back in the Day&quot;, Rosenbaum planned to direct another comedy film, titled &quot;Sorry is For Sissies&quot;. The film had a cast including Jon Heder, Colin Hanks and Jennifer Love Hewitt; however, at least half of the film&#x27;s budget was lost, and the film was scrapped.

On June 17, 2014, Rosenbaum was cast as the lead in the TV Land original sitcom &quot;Impastor&quot;. The plot has been summarised as a &quot;low-life who hides out in a small town by conning the residents into thinking he is their newly hired gay pastor&quot;.

In 2017, Rosenbaum served as narrator for the reality television show &quot;Hunted&quot; which pitted investigators against teams of ordinary citizens trying to evade capture as fugitives. Rosenbaum also starred in the Indie thriller &quot;The Neighbor&quot; opposite William Fichtner.

In 2018, Rosenbaum debuted his casual celebrity interview-based podcast called &quot;Inside of You&quot;. His first guest was his &quot;Smallville&quot; co-star Tom Welling. The two subsequently launched the podcast &quot;Talkville&quot; in July 2022, where they re-watch every episode of &quot;Smallville&quot;.

Rosenbaum reprised the role of Martinex in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot;, which premiered in May 2023.

On January 6, 2023, Rosenbaum&#x27;s band Sun Spin released their second album, &quot;Never Is What it Is&quot;.

In October 2023 &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; reported that Rosenbaum and his longtime friend Jon Heder would star in the horror-themed reality television series &quot;Scared with Michael Rosenbaum and Jon Heder&quot;. Rosenbaum said of the project, &quot;I wanted to do a reality show because we love horror movies. We&#x27;ll go to the scariest places on Earth.&quot;

<text>Endeavour River National Park is a national park in Queensland, Australia, gazetted to protect and preserve some of the natural and cultural resources in and around the mouth of the Endeavour River, immediately north of the small town of Cooktown. The park is located northwest of Brisbane.

Naturalists Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander collected specimens of local &#x27;Australian&#x27; flora in 1770 from this area which were taken back to the Royal Botanic Gardens in England. Sydney Parkinson first illustrated local Australian Aboriginal people encountered nearby, plus flora collected and fauna seen; and kangaroos were first given their modern English name (borrowing from the local Guugu Yimithirr language).

HM Bark &quot;Endeavour&quot;, under the command of Lieutenant James Cook, had struck reefs and been pulled ashore for repairs along the river locally known within Guugu Yimithirr as Wabalumbaal, possibly near the present site of Cooktown. The river was renamed on James Cook&#x27;s charts as the Endeavour River, after &quot;Endeavour&quot;, and the current National Park appears, in turn, to be named after the river.

The present National Park contains coastal dunes, freshwater wetlands, mangrove forests, heathlands, tropical woodlands and the estuary plus parts of the Endeavour River catchment. It is mostly accessible by boat only, and still contains flora and fauna species of the kind collected and illustrated back in 1770.

<text>Eubenangee Swamp is a national park in Eubenangee in the Cairns Region, Queensland, Australia, 1332 km northwest of Brisbane. It is part of the Coastal Wet Tropics Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for the conservation of lowland tropical rainforest birds. It plays home to over 190 species of birds.

The national park is found within the water catchment areas of the North Johnstone and Russell Rivers and is part of the Wet Tropics of Queensland bioregion.

The average elevation of terrain is 24 metres. This national park is characterized by high annual rainfall, and this is most pronounced from December to April.

== Vegetation ==

Eubenangee Swamp National Park represents an intricate mosaic of diverse and regionally rare vegetation types. Melaleuca woodlands and forests (Type 56a, 56d) dominate the majority of the western and eastern margins of the park whilst the central band, which spans its northern to southern boundaries, contains a variety of mesophyll vine forest communities (Types 2a, 2c) as well as feather palm dominated seasonal swamp forests (Type 4b). 

Sedgelands (Types 69c, 69e) are located in semi-permanent swamp areas in a number of zones running adjacent to the northern to eastern boundary limits. Grasslands (Types 68a, 68b, 68c), including critically endangered Hemarthria uncinata dominated communities, are interspersed in pockets throughout this area growing upon seasonally inundated alluvial soils.

<doc id="103280" wikidata="Q1333457" url="?curid=103280" title="Eungella National Park">
<text>Eungella National Park ( ; meaning &quot;Land of the clouds&quot;) is a protected area in Queensland, Australia. It is on the Clarke Range at the end of the Pioneer Valley 80 km west of Mackay, and 858 km northwest of Brisbane. Eungella is noted for the national park which surrounds it. It is considered to be the longest continual stretch of sub-tropical rainforest in Australia. The original inhabitants are the Wirri people. The park is covered by dense rainforest and is known for its platypuses. 

==Regional description==
Eungella National Park is located on an isolated massif about 80 km west of Mackay in North–central Queensland. The Eungella Plateau rises to 1259m at Mt Dalrymple and to similar elevation at Mt William, forming part of the Clarke Range.
The park preserves about half (30,000 ha) the area of rainforest present at the time of European settlement, which has been much reduced by logging. Rainforest in the National Park ranges from high elevation, notophyll vine forest to low elevation mesophyll forests at the base of the ranges. Notophyll vine forest with tall eucalypts such as red stringybark (&quot;Eucalyptus resinifera&quot;) is found on the ridges of eastern facing slopes and drier western slopes often contain hoop pine (&quot;Araucaria cunninghamii&quot;). The rainforests of the Eungella massif represent one of the most isolated patches of this vegetation type in Australia. 
 The rainforest is bordered by eucalypt forests and woodlands across much of its extent.

==History and climate==
Eungella National Park was declared over 49,610 hectares in 1941. In 1986 the National Park was extended to include land at Mt Beatrice and a small area of former State Forest near Finch Hatton, so that today the park encompasses 52,900 ha.

The word Eungella is an aboriginal name meaning &#x27;land of the cloud&#x27; and with an average annual rainfall of 2240mm, it often seems perched in a cloud. The temperature is generally around five degrees cooler than the surrounding lowlands.

==Endemic species==
Eungella National Park is recognised as a centre of endemism for Australian rainforest species. There were three key refuge areas in mid-east Queensland during past periods of rainforest contraction. The most important is thought to have been in the Clarke Range and Eungella National Park area, which support many endemic species, including a spiny crayfish, &quot;Euastacus eungella&quot; (Eungella spiny crayfish); a leaf-tailed gecko, &quot;Phyllurus nepthys&quot; (Eungella leaf-tailed gecko); a skink, &quot;Tumbunascincus luteilateralis&quot; (orange-spotted forest-skink); a honeyeater, &quot;Bolemoreus hindwoodi&quot; (Eungella honeyeater); and three frogs, &quot;Taudactylus liemi&quot; (Eungella tinker frog), &quot;Taudactylus eungellensis&quot; (Eungella torrent frog or Eungella dayfrog) and &quot;Rheobatrachus vitellinus&quot; (northern gastric-brooding frog).

==Flora==
A total of 16 species of fungi, 19 mosses, 4 conifers, 92 ferns, 299 dicots and 54 monocots are recorded as occurring in the National Park. Much of the rainforest in the National Park is complex mesophyll vine forest with pockets of simple and complex notophyll vine forests on poorer soils. Many of the vegetation communities including rainforests, vine thickets and vine forests are considered fire sensitive.

===Dicots===
&quot;Elaeocarpus largiflorens&quot; is a rainforest tree reaching 30 m in height which occurs in the wet tropics from sea level to 1200 m elevation and is at the southern limit of its natural range at Eungella. It produces 20 mm long fruits that are eaten and dispersed by a range of frugivorous vertebrates. The Eungella hairy daisy (&quot;Ozothamnus eriocephalus&quot;) is a shrub species with very limited range, currently listed as vulnerable at both state and federal levels. &quot;Omphalea celata&quot; is a small tree currently listed as vulnerable at a state and federal level, which was first described in 1994 and is found at Hazlewood Gorge within the park. It is a host plant for the zodiac moth (&quot;Alcides metaurus&quot;).

===Ferns===
In the southern half of Queensland, the giant fern (&quot;Angiopteris evecta&quot;) is found in only four widely spaced sites, including Eungella, which may indicate a past wider distribution when Queensland was much wetter. This species needs a highly-reliable water supply and high humidity to sustain its enormous fronds. The vulnerable &quot;Dryopteris sparsa&quot; is also found in the park.

==Fauna==
Over 175 species of mammals, reptiles, birds and amphibians have been recorded in the park.

===Birds===
111 species of birds have been recorded in Eungella National Park. The Eungella honeyeater (&quot;Lichenostomus hindwoodi&quot;) is endemic to the highland rainforest of the Clarke Range, including the park. It can be distinguished from it is close relative and sister species the bridled honeyeater (&quot;Lichenostomus frenata&quot;) by its plumage colour and markings, size, bill colour and calls. It was first collected in 1975 and described in 1983, making it the most recently described Australian bird species. It occurs in the park, and also feeds in adjacent eucalypt woodlands.

The red-necked crake (&quot;Rallina tricolor&quot;), previously thought to only occur as far south as Townsville, was first observed in the park in 1981. The buff-breasted paradise kingfisher (&quot;Tanysiptera sylvia&quot;) and the white-browed robin (&quot;Poecilodryas superciliosa&quot;) are at the southern extent of their distribution at Eungella. The regent bowerbird (&quot;Sericulus chrysocephalus&quot;) occurs at its northern limit in the park and surrounding area, as do the brown thornbill (&quot;Acanthiza pusilla&quot;) and the glossy black cockatoo (&quot;Calyptorhynchus lathami&quot;). Australian swiftlets (&quot;Aerodramus terraereginae&quot;) breed in caves in the Finch Hatton Creek area, and one of the few Australian records of glossy swiftlet (&quot;Collocalia esculenta&quot;) was in the park.

===Amphibians===
A total of 16 amphibian species have been recorded in the park. Globally, amphibians have undergone rapid and extensive decline in recent decades, due in part to habitat loss and pollution, but unknown factors threaten almost half the species in decline. Amphibians are more threatened and are declining more rapidly than either birds or mammals. An exotic and highly-virulent pathogen may be contributing to the decline of rainforest frog species in eastern Australia. The causative agent may be the chytrid fungus &quot;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&quot;, although this has not as yet been detected in stream-dwelling frogs in the park.

Eungella National Park is recognised as one of eleven areas with high levels of frog endemism. Of the three endemic frog species endemic, two are still believed to exist today, the Eungella dayfrog and the Eungella tinker frog, while one species, the northern gastric brooding frog, is believed extinct. All three species are ground dwelling and their distribution is restricted to streams or areas close to streams in mid to high elevation rainforests.

The Eungella dayfrog was previously more common, but has declined in number and distribution in recent decades, and is now considered endangered at a state and federal level. The peak breeding period for this species is between January and May, but tadpoles at all sizes and developmental stages can be found throughout the year. This frog is one of only two species known to use body language, including small hops and movements of the arms and legs, to attract the attention of other frogs; a behaviour which may have evolved due to the noise of mountain streams rushing over rocks in its habitat making calling a less effective means of communication.

The Eungella tinkerfrog is considered near threatened in Queensland. It occurs between 180 and 1250m elevation, but is sparsely distributed and rarely seen. Potential threats to this species include forest grazing, trampling by livestock, introduced species such as the cane toad (&quot;Rhinella marina&quot;) and the chytrid fungus.

The northern gastric brooding frog (&quot;Rheobatrachus vitellinus&quot;) was discovered in January 1984, but has not been seen since March 1985 and is believed to be extinct. It is one of only two species in the world known to brood its young in its stomach, with the mother swallowing fertilised eggs or early larval stages, before &#x27;giving birth&#x27; through the mouth. Its distribution was exclusively undisturbed rainforest within Eungella National Park at altitudes of 400-1000m, before it underwent a sudden range contraction and disappeared.

===Mammals===
28 species of mammals have been recorded in the park. This includes several bat species including the little bent-wing bat (&quot;Miniopterus australis&quot;), eastern horseshoe bat (&quot;Rhinolophus megaphyllus&quot;), common blossom bat (&quot;Syconycteris australis&quot;), eastern forest bat (&quot;Vespadelus pumilus&quot;), eastern long-eared bat (&quot;Nyctophilus bifax&quot;) and grey-headed flying-fox (&quot;Pteropus poliocephalus&quot;).

Platypus (&quot;Ornithorhynchus anatinus&quot;) are often seen at the viewing platform at Broken River which is the most visited location in the park. They have an unusual foraging behaviour and are the only mammal known to use electrolocation for detecting prey. Platypus are generally found in slow-moving rivers and small pools and are highly adapted to a semi-aquatic life. They have extremely dense fur, large webs on their feet extending well beyond the toenails, a broad, flat tail and excellent swimming ability, paddling with their forelegs in alternating strokes, with their hindlegs and tail trailing behind. When foraging, captured prey is stored in two cheek pouches and later masticated and swallowed when the platypus surfaces. An apparent feeding association has been noted between the azure kingfisher (&quot;Ceyx azureus&quot;) and the platypus at Eungella National Park, where the birds have been observed watching for fish disturbed by the platypus, before diving into the water in search of prey.

===Reptiles===
20 species of reptiles occur in the park. Three species of leaf-tailed geckos (&quot;Phyllurus ossa, P. isis&quot; and &quot;P. nepthys&quot;) occur in small rainforest patches in and around the park. &quot;P. nepthys&quot; is endemic to the Clarke Range. The recently discovered orange-sided rainforest skink (&quot;Tumbunascincus luteilateralis&quot;) is endemic to the area, and is restricted to upland rainforest above 900m in moist areas which contain rotting logs and palm fronds. The skink species &quot;Lampropholis basiliscus&quot; reaches its southern limit at Eungella.

===Insects===
There are several endemic or range-restricted insect species found in Eungella National Park. A study of the order Diptera (flies) in seven rainforest locations found that the long-isolated, high elevation, rain-forested massif at Eungella were a unique entity in the analyses, characterized by high numbers of Chironomidae, Psychodidae, Tipulidae and Empididae. Flies in the genus &quot;Cyamops&quot; including; &quot;C. pectinatus, C. dayi, C. delta&quot; and &quot;C. pectiatus&quot; have been collected in damp areas in the park including near streams, waterfalls and marshes. The fly species Drosophila birchii is restricted to patches of warm, wet tropical rainforest between New Guinea and Eungella.

The katydid &quot;Phricta zwicka&quot; has been collected from Eungella National Park. The Megalopteran &quot;Protochauliodes eungella&quot; is known only from the Eungella area. Two new species from the order Odonata were collected in the Eungella area; &quot;Austroaeschna christine&quot; and &quot;A. eungella&quot;. A survey of butterflies in the park undertaken in 1993 recorded 37 species with an additional 15 species known from museum and private records.

===Crustaceans===
The Eungella spiny crayfish is unique to the creeks on the Clarke Range. It is listed as critically endangered due to its limited range, fragmented distribution, habitat decline due to exotic species, such as feral pigs (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;), red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), feral cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;) and cane toads, and its vulnerability to climate change.

==Environmental threats==
Threats to the biodiversity of Eungella National Park include habitat fragmentation, the effects of introduced species, fire and human impacts.

===Pest plants and animals===
Many introduced animals have been recorded in the park including the cane toad, red fox, feral cat, rabbit (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;), black rat (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot;), house mouse (&quot;Mus musculus&quot;), and feral pig. Pigs disturb the ground, promoting the spread of weeds, remove natural recruitment of flora and fauna and can be vectors for pathogens such as cinnamon fungus (&quot;Phytopthera cinnamomi&quot;). Cinnamon fungus has been found on the Clarke Range, including in one area of Dalrymple Heights, where approximately 20% of the rainforest has died.

Cats, foxes and feral dogs (&quot;Canis familiaris&quot;) can threaten native fauna through predation, competition for resources and transmission of disease. In Australia, cats are known to prey on 186 native bird species, 64 mammal species, 87 species of reptile, 10 species of amphibians and numerous invertebrates. Foxes prey on possums, small dasyurids, native rats, and other mammals, birds and insects. Feral dogs hunt alone or in packs and can prey on larger mammals such as wallabies. Road construction and fragmentation of habitat can expose local populations of native animals to predation by exotic predators that may otherwise have difficulties penetrating dense forest environments. Much of Eungella National Park is accessible only by walking tracks, which may limit feral animal spread, but may make control more difficult.

Weeds including lantana (&quot;Lantana camara&quot;), blue morning glory (&quot;Ipomoea indica&quot;) and red Natal grass (&quot;Melinis repens&quot;) are common on the disturbed edges of the park and roadsides. Lantana is a Class 3 Pest in the state of Queensland, and is recognised as a weed of national significance (Mackay Regional Pest Management Group 2013). Other highly-flammable weeds common in the park include guinea grass (&quot;Megathyrsus maximus&quot;), rat&#x27;s tail grasses (&quot;Sporobolus&quot; spp.), para grass (&quot;Urochloa mutica&quot;) and molasses grass (&quot;Melinis minutiflora&quot;).

===Fire===
Fire is a key disturbing pressure on the rainforests of Eungella National Park, and can result in fragmentation of the rainforest into smaller areas less capable of maintaining the present complexity of plants and animals and increasing edge effects. The rainforest, vine thicket, vine forest and riparian communities found in the park do not require fire for regeneration, and it may irreversibly alter the species composition and community structure, simplifying ecosystems and reducing floristic and structural diversity. Fire can also reduce litter, fallen logs and hollow-bearing trees which provide critical habitat for some species.

==Management==
Eungella National Park is managed by the Queensland Department of National Parks, Sport and Racing. There is currently no management plan for the park. National Parks are managed to provide for the permanent preservation of the area&#x27;s natural condition and the protection of the area&#x27;s cultural resources and values. Other management principles for National Parks are to present the park&#x27;s cultural and natural resources and their values and to ensure that park use is nature based and ecologically sustainable.

==Economic benefits==
National parks and other protected areas have traditionally been created and funded primarily to provide conservation benefits, but they can also provide economic benefits, particularly in rural and regional areas, through job creation and visitor spending. A visitor survey conducted in 2001 estimated that visitors to Eungella National Park spend $10.9 million in the local region annually.

==Facilities==
Camping is permitted at Fern Flat campground, which is accessible by walking only. The Broken River picnic area has facilities for day visitors.

There are more than 20 km of bushwalking tracks, some with scenic lookouts. A platform on the Broken River provides good viewing of platypus, eels and turtles.

<text>Eurimbula National Park is a protected area in the locality of Eurimbula, Queensland, Australia, in the Gladstone Region near Agnes Water, 411 km north of Brisbane.

== Location and Features ==
The Park is located on the central Queensland coast, nearly 112-km north-west of Bundaberg. The first Europeans to visit the place were Captain James Cook and botanist Sir Joseph Banks. It is covered with diverse vegetation including mangroves, littoral rainforest and coastal vine thickets, freshwater paperbark swamps, eucalypt forests and much more. In addition to 757 species of plants, there is a habitat here for 430 species of animals, of which 26 are on the list of rare or endangered species.

The average elevation of the terrain is 40 metres.

==Visitor facilities==
Eurimbula National Park consists of three separate sections. The main section is centred on Eurimbula Creek and is accessible (4WD recommended) from the main Agnes Water road. There are camping facilities at Bustard Beach near the mouth of Eurimbula Creek. Inland, a short uphill walk leads to a lookout, known as Ganoonga Noonga, with views of the coast and paperbark swamps of the park. Further north, there is another camping ground at Middle Creek; however, there are no facilities here.

The northern section of the park includes Rodds Peninsula and Bustard Head and its lighthouse; nearby is Jenny Lind Creek. Tours from the Town of 1770 regularly visit Bustard Head; however, Rodds Peninsula is accessible only by private boat. The western section of the park is rugged and extremely difficult to reach.

<doc id="103284" wikidata="Q1394640" url="?curid=103284" title="Family Islands National Park">
<text>Family Islands National Park is an Australian national park comprising a group of continental islands lying a short distance off the coast, about midway between Cairns and Townsville, in Far North Queensland. Most of the area has been designated as part of the national park.

The islands were given their collective name and also English names by Captain Cook when he sailed through the area in 1770. They were part of the mainland until roughly 8,000 years ago when the sea level rose.

==The Islands==
The largest of the Family Islands, their Aboriginal names, and their position in the &quot;family&quot; are:
* Dunk Island &quot;(Coonanglebah)&quot; – the father
* Richards Island &quot;(Bedarra)&quot; – the mother
* Wheeler Island &quot;(Toolgbar)&quot; and Coombe Island &quot;(Coomba)&quot; – the twins
* Smith Island (&quot;Kurrumbah&quot;), Bowden Island &quot;(Budjoo)&quot; and Hudson Island &quot;(Coolah)&quot; – the triplets.

There are also a number of smaller islands:
* Kumboola, which is connected to Dunk Island on particularly low tides
* Mound Island &quot;(Purtaboi)&quot;, which is protected as a sea bird nesting habitat
* Woln Garin, a small island off Dunk Island&#x27;s south east corner, known locally as &quot;40ft Rock&quot;

<text>Fitzroy Island National Park is a gazetted protected area covering Fitzroy Island, in Far North Queensland, Queensland, Australia. Fitzroy Island (also called Koba or Gabar), is a continental island located east of Cairns on the mainland.

The Aboriginal people particularly connected to this Island are the &quot;Kobaburra&quot; (or alternatively &quot;Gaba:ra&quot;) from within the &quot;Gungganyji&quot; language group.

As a Queensland National Park the natural and cultural resources of the Island itself (down to high tide) are protected by the Nature Conservation Act 1992 and much of the island is therefore off-limits to visitors. Most visitors remain on the sheltered western side of the island, where the jetty, resort and best snorkeling can be found.

==Island==

Fitzroy Island is a continental island, not a coral cay. It became an island when sea levels rose at the end of the last ice age, flooding a plain between a hill that is now Fitzroy Island, and what is now Cape Grafton. Over the 10,000 years since that time, coral reefs have formed in the bay on the protected western side of the island, and lush rainforest on its shore.
Fitzroy Island has been put to many uses by humankind. It is part of the traditional lands of the Gurabana Gungandji people, who recorded its formation in myth, and was used as a hunting and fishing ground. In 1778, Lieutenant James Cook named the island after the family name of the Duke of Grafton, who was the British Prime Minister when his ship, HMB &quot;Endeavour&quot;, had set sail. Through the 1800s, a pearling and beche-de-mer industry operated from the island. In 1876, a quarantine station was established on Fitzroy Island for Chinese &quot;coolies&quot; en route to the Palmer River Goldfields. A giant clam research station remains in operation on Welcome Bay. The Island has also served as part an aboriginal mission in the early 1900s, an artillery gun emplacement in World War II, and, more recently, a tourist resort.

The Island has also been home to lighthouses warning ships in the Grafton Passage of the reefs around the island, and a small automatic light on Little Fitzroy Island, just off the north-east point, still serves this purpose. An inactive lighthouse sits on the point above, and is part of the circuit trail that is open to tourists.

Fitzroy&#x27;s isolation has resulted in a unique habitat, with few large mammals. The dominant predators on the island are reptiles; particularly pythons (brown and green), monitor lizards and the Major skink. The latter of these is particularly common and will be seen frequently as a tourist wanders around the trails. There are no venomous snakes on the island, though python bites can become infected.

==Recreation==

===Walking trails===

There is a walking track that takes in the northern end of the island, the lighthouse on the north-west point which overlooks Little Fitzroy Island, and the island&#x27;s peak, which offers stunning 360 degree views over the surrounding reefs and Cape Grafton. From the top, on a clear day it is possible to make out the Frankland Islands to the south. The trail then drops back down to the resort.

&quot;Nudey Beach&quot; can be accessed by heading along the trail at the southern end of the resort, and leads along the edge of the island through rainforest, with occasional glimpses out to Cape Grafton, and then descends to Nudey Beach, which was once a nude bathing beach, with some coral available for snorkelers.

===Snorkeling===

The fringing reef is a fair distance from the shore at the northern end of Welcome Bay, where it starts at the quite prominent &#x27;Bird Rock&#x27;. It runs almost all the way down to the jetty before there is a small gap where the boats come in. The reef starts again near the rocks at the southern end of the beach, and runs around the corner to Nudey Beach. Along this stretch it is extremely close to shore - literally just a few steps from the shore. The snorkelling at Fitzroy is greatly underrated. Visibility can be a bit low, especially after rough weather, but the coral is excellent and the variety of fish superb. The clownfish (&quot;Amphiprion percula&quot;) can be found, as well as other anemonefish. Parrotfish and wrasses are common, and green sea turtles regularly frequent the bay.

It is unlikely that box jellyfish would be encountered at Fitzroy Island due to the 4 km passage between the island and the mainland, but they have been found there occasionally, as well as other stinging jellyfish.

===Resort===
Fitzroy Island Resort can be found on Welcome Bay. Fitzroy Island Resort is a 60-minute ferry ride (about 30 km) from Cairns in Queensland and is surrounded by a reef system that forms part of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.

<text>Fort Lytton National Park is a national park in Lytton, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Its main attraction is &quot;Fort Lytton Historic Military Precinct&quot;, providing guided tours of historic Fort Lytton, a museum and re-enactments. The park was created in 1990 as Queensland&#x27;s first historic national park. It initially contained only heritage-listed Fort Lytton, a colonial coastal fort that continued to operate as a military base until after the Second World War. The park was extended in 1999 to include Lytton Quarantine Station which occupied adjacent land. The Quarantine Station is also heritage-listed, but is only open to the public on special occasions.

The park is northeast of the Brisbane CBD near the mouth of the Brisbane River.

==Fort Lytton==
Fort Lytton was constructed in 1880–1881 to protect both the city and the port from naval attack. After the Australian colonies became a federation (the Commonwealth of Australia) in 1901, the fort and the land on which it stood were transferred to the Commonwealth. Fort Lytton continued to operate as a military base until shortly after the Second World War (WW2). It was closed down progressively, the last operation to close being the signal station which closed in 1965. The land and fort were sold to the Ampol oil company in 1963, as the site for the Lytton Oil Refinery. The land contained three parcels that had particular historic significance. These were the land containing the original fort, the land containing Lytton Hill, and the land containing the remains of a WW2 heavy anti-aircraft battery. In 1988 Ampol transferred the parcel containing the original fort to the Queensland Government, and this became Fort Lytton National Park in 1990.

Fort Lytton is open free on Sundays, most public holidays and other special occasions. It features both guided and self-guided tours of the historic fort and other military structures, a military museum and regular historic re-enactments (although not every week). Access to the park at other times is by appointment only, and is subject to fees.

==Lytton Quarantine Station==

The Lytton Quarantine Station was established in 1913–1914, to accommodate newly arrived immigrants and persons considered to be at risk of causing infection to the general population. The quarantine station was on land adjacent to Fort Lytton. By the late 1980s the quarantine station had closed completely. In 1988 management of part of the quarantine site and buildings, including the quarantine station jetty, was taken over by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service and was incorporated into Fort Lytton National Park in 1999. The quarantine station is only open to the public on special occasions, but visitors can always walk around the outside of the buildings. The Visitor and Information Centre (which is also the headquarters of Fort Lytton Historical Association) previously housed the quarantine station laundry.

The Quarantine Station is only open to the public on special occasions.

==Fort Lytton Military Museum==
The museum has a collection of over 2000 items which are distributed throughout the park including in 5 buildings, 6 gun pits, 2 shelter structures and several open air locations. Admission to the museum is free, although two of the buildings (the submarine mining building and the black powder rooms) can only be accessed on guided tours.

The Old Dining Hall houses a collection of over 10,000 artefacts pertaining to Queensland&#x27;s military history. Entry to the museum is free.

==Development of the national park==
Soon after the creation of the national park in 1990, volunteers of the Royal Artillery Association of Queensland created a sub-branch to work with the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service to develop a historic military exhibit for the public. That sub-branch became Fort Lytton Historical Association (FLHA) in 1999. FLHA is a non-profit volunteer organization which provides free guided tours of the Fort on Sundays and public holidays. It also operates the Visitor Information Centre and sells basic refreshments. FLHA seeks donations to cover its expenses.

In 2019, the Queensland Military Historical Society (formerly known as Victoria Barracks Historical Society) relocated from its former premises at Church Street, Fortitude Valley to the old Dining Hall at Fort Lytton.
