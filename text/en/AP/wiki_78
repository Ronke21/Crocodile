<text>Johnny Lozada Correa (born December 21, 1967) is a Puerto Rican singer, actor, host, and television personality.

Lozada was a member of Puerto Rican boy band Menudo during its golden years, joining the group in 1980 and staying until early 1984. After leaving Menudo, he formed the singing group Proyecto M with Rene Farrait and Xavier Serbiá, who were, like him, Menudo alumni. After the dissolving of Proyecto M, Lozada took on acting participating in several Latin telenovelas. In 1998, Lozada and other former members of Menudo received an invitation from Ray Reyes and formed El Reencuentro, to reminisce the years they had spent with Menudo. The concerts proved to be a success, and the tours extended for several years.

In 2010, Lozada joined &quot;Sal y Pimienta&quot;, a Latin gossip show, as a commentator. After two years, he left the show to host &quot;¡Despierta América!&quot;.

==Family and early life==

Johnny Lozada Correa was born in Caguas, Puerto Rico, at the San Rafael Clinic. He is the only son of Ramón Lozada and Aracelis &quot;Celita&quot; Correa.

==Recording and acting career==

===Menudo: 1979–1984===
Lozada joined Menudo at the end of 1979, replacing original member Carlos Meléndez. Lozada spent the next four years with the group. During that time, he participated in albums like &quot;Más, Mucho Más&quot; (1980), &quot;Fuego&quot; (1981), &quot;Quiero Ser&quot; (1981), &quot;Por Amor&quot; (1982), and &quot;A Todo Rock&quot; (1983), among others. He also starred in the telenovelas &quot;Quiero Ser&quot; and &quot;Es por Amor&quot;, both based on the group. Finally, Lozada acted in the films &quot;&quot; and &quot;Una Aventura Llamada Menudo&quot;.

During this time, the group enjoyed success in all of America. According to creator, Edgardo Díaz, this installment of the group &quot;opened a lot of doors in Latin America, and was very strong&quot;. Among their achievements are four sold-out concerts at the Madison Square Garden in 1983, and record-breaking concerts in Brazil with an audience of 200,000 in São Paulo and 100,000 in Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte.

Lozada was considered the most emotional of the group, and his hits with the group included the classic &quot;Clara&quot;, &quot;Mi Banda Toca Rock&quot;, &quot;Lady&quot; and &quot;Señora Mia&quot;.

===Solo career and Proyecto M===

In 1984, Lozada turned 16 and left Menudo, as was usual among its members. He was replaced by Robi Rosa. A farewell concert was held at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City.

Lozada was signed by RCA and recorded two solo albums: &quot;Johnny&quot; and &quot;Invítame&quot;. This last album was nominated for Best Latin Pop Album at the 27th Grammy Awards, alongside José Feliciano, Plácido Domingo, José José, María Conchita Alonso, and Menudo themselves.

In 1986, Lozada participated in a campaign to encourage youth abstinence from sex, in which he recorded two duets (&quot;Cuando Estemos Juntos&quot; and &quot;Détente&quot;) with Tatiana and music videos for them. This received much publicity in Latin America and even in the United States, where it was the subject of a report by John Stossel on &quot;20/20&quot;.

That year also, Lozada participated alongside the Puerto Rico national basketball team (joining such stars as Jose Ortiz, Ruben Rodriguez, Federico Fico Lopez and Angelo Cruz among others) as well as Rafael Jose, Magali Carrasquillo, Kobbo Santarrosa, Jaime Bello, and others in a song named &quot;Yo Voy a Mi&quot;, for which a CD and musical video were produced, in order to boost the basketball team&#x27;s games&#x27; attendance numbers as it headed to the 1987 Pre-Olympic tournament in Uruguay and, later on, to the 1988 Olympic Games in South Korea.

In 1987, Lozada joined former Menudo alumni Rene Farrait and Xavier Serbiá in the singing group Proyecto M (Lozada and Farrait were later joined at Proyecto M by Lozada&#x27;s former bandmate at Menudo, Ray Reyes). The group enjoyed some success in Latin America, and was invited to participate in the telenovela &quot;Alba Marina&quot;, alongside Venezuelan singer Karina. The group was together for 8 years and recorded four albums, during which Serbiá left and was replaced by Ray Reyes.

===Acting career and &quot;El Reencuentro&quot;===

After leaving Proyecto M, Lozada began acting participating in telenovelas like &quot;Señora Tentación&quot; and &quot;Escándalo&quot;. In 2001, he played boxer Johnny Trinidad in the &quot;Amigas y rivales&quot; telenovela with Televisa. The next year, he starred in &quot;Cómplices al Rescate&quot; as veterinarian Sebastián. He also acted in the play &quot;Solo para Mujeres&quot;, and in the third season of &quot;Big Brother VIP&quot;.

In 1998, Lozada and former Menudo members Rene Farrait, Miguel Cancel, Ray Reyes, Charlie Masso and Ricky Meléndez got together in Puerto Rico for a concert named El Reencuentro, with dedication to the convalescing ex-Menudo Fernando Sallaberry, Menudo&#x27;s original lead singer, who was unable to join the reunion due to health issues. The concert featured new renditions of their hits from Menudo. El Reencuentro was so successful that they needed to add two more concerts that weekend and later, they went on tour all over Latin America and the United States. The group toured frequently until 2015, when they broke up.

===Television host===

Lozada continued to tour with El Reencuentro until 2015, as well as acting in theater. He has worked in the comedy &quot;Al Aire&quot; and the play &quot;Manos Quietas&quot;. In 2012, he joined the cast of &quot;Confesiones del Pene&quot;.

In 2010, Lozada joined &quot;Sal y Pimienta&quot;, a Latin gossip show, as commentator. After two years, he left the show to host &quot;¡Despierta América!&quot;. In December 2016, Lozada announced that he would be leaving &quot;¡Despierta América!&quot;. In February 2017, he joined the cast of the children&#x27;s reality/talent show &quot;Pequeños Gigantes USA&quot; as a celebrity captain. The group that Lozada coached, &quot;Peque Flow&quot;, won the competition. On July 30, 2018, Lozada joined the Puerto Rican gossip show Lo Se Todo, replacing long time host Pedro Juan Figueroa. Lozada left &quot;Lo Se Todo&quot; in January 2019.

As of October 30, 2023, Lozada is a co-host of the morning talk/variety show &quot;En La Mañana&quot; on WLII-DT (TeleOnce).

==&quot;Mira Quien Baila&quot;==
On November 24, 2013, Lozada won the fourth season of Univision&#x27;s dance competition &quot;Mira Quien Baila&quot;. The judge panel for this season was composed by Horacio Villalobos, Bianca Marroquin and Ninel Conde. Lozada began his participation in the contest by winning the first gala, earning 66% of the public vote. The following week he defeated El Dasa in a duel, receiving 76%. On September 29, 2013, Lozada was forced to dance twice, after a regional Mexican routine failed to convince the judges. He avoided the elimination round by advancing with a tango in his second routine. Throughout the season he was disfavored by the all-Mexican jury, even being involved in controversy when his masculinity was questioned by Conde following the regional Mexican routine. Lozada remained diplomatic to the attack, but his wife did respond. The following week he danced to &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;, remaining in the winner&#x27;s circle. The fifth date did not feature eliminations from the previous gala, but Lozada avoided being nominated to the elimination round with a cha-cha-cha. This was followed by another direct classification with a pasodoble.

At the seventh gala, Lozada fell into the elimination round for the first time, following an urban routine. In the eight date, he performed a disco routine and survived the jury&#x27;s nomination to the elimination round by besting Manny Manuel with 62% of the vote. During the voting process, his nomination became a trending topic in several countries. At the ninth gala, Lozada danced a quickstep, being sent into a single-elimination qualificatory to the finals. At the semifinals, he danced a merengue and advanced by eliminating Mane de la Parra, who only gathered 35% despite receiving the public endorsement of Conde. Despite publicly supporting his opponent, Conde did not congratulate Lozada or react following his elimination. He suffered a slight muscle torn in his right arm during this gala, but was treated with injections and decided to continue. With two tangos in the finals, Lozada defeated Marjorie de Sousa and Pedro Moreno by gathering 53% of the total vote. He donated the $50,000 prize to Habitat for Humanity&#x27;s Puerto Rico chapter.

Four years later, Lozada returned to the show as one of the judges for season five along with Roselyn Sanchez and Javier Castillo.

==Personal life==

Lozada is married to Sandy Meléndez. They have three children together: Natalia, Thalía, and Jahn Gabriel. Lozada also has an adopted son, Felipe.

<text>Rattus is a genus of muroid rodents, all typically called rats. However, the term rat can also be applied to rodent species outside of this genus.

==Species and description==
The best-known &quot;Rattus&quot; species are the black rat (&quot;R. rattus&quot;) and the brown rat (&quot;R. norvegicus&quot;). The group is generally known as the Old World rats or true rats and originated in Asia. Rats are bigger than most Old World mice, which are their relatives, but seldom weigh over in the wild.

==Taxonomy of &quot;Rattus&quot;==
The genus &quot;Rattus&quot; is a member of the giant subfamily Murinae. Several other murine genera are sometimes considered part of &quot;Rattus&quot;: &quot;Lenothrix&quot;, &quot;Anonymomys&quot;, &quot;Sundamys&quot;, &quot;Kadarsanomys&quot;, &quot;Diplothrix&quot;, &quot;Margaretamys&quot;, &quot;Lenomys&quot;, &quot;Komodomys&quot;, &quot;Palawanomys&quot;, &quot;Bunomys&quot;, &quot;Nesoromys&quot;, &quot;Stenomys&quot;, &quot;Taeromys&quot;, &quot;Paruromys&quot;, &quot;Abditomys&quot;, &quot;Tryphomys&quot;, &quot;Limnomys&quot;, &quot;Tarsomys&quot;, &quot;Bullimus&quot;, &quot;Apomys&quot;, &quot;Millardia&quot;, &quot;Srilankamys&quot;, &quot;Niviventer&quot;, &quot;Maxomys&quot;, &quot;Leopoldamys&quot;, &quot;Berylmys&quot;, &quot;Mastomys&quot;, &quot;Myomys&quot;, &quot;Praomys&quot;, &quot;Hylomyscus&quot;, &quot;Heimyscus&quot;, &quot;Stochomys&quot;, &quot;Dephomys&quot; and &quot;Aethomys&quot;.

The genus &quot;Rattus&quot; proper contains 64 extant species. A subgeneric breakdown of the species has been proposed, but does not include all species.

===Species===
===Phylogeny===
The following phylogeny of selected &quot;Rattus&quot; species is from .
===Fossil species===
In contrast to the large number of living species, as of 2024, just four fossil species have been placed in &quot;Rattus&quot; proper:

* &quot;Rattus baoshanensis&quot; - Late Pliocene China
* &quot;Rattus jaegeri&quot; - Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene Thailand
* &quot;Rattus pristinus&quot; - Early Pleistocene China
* &quot;Rattus miyakoensis&quot; - Late Pleistocene Japan

<text>The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI, acronym pronounced ) is a private, nonprofit research and higher education facility dedicated to the study of marine science and engineering.

Established in 1930 in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, it is the largest independent oceanographic research institution in the U.S., with staff and students numbering about 1,000.

==Constitution==
The institution is organized into six departments, the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Ocean Research, and a marine policy center. Its shore-based facilities are located in the village of Woods Hole, Massachusetts, United States and a mile and a half away on the Quissett Campus. The bulk of the institution&#x27;s funding comes from grants and contracts from the National Science Foundation and other government agencies, augmented by foundations and private donations.

WHOI scientists, engineers, and students collaborate to develop theories, test ideas, build seagoing instruments, and collect data in diverse marine environments. Ships operated by WHOI carry research scientists throughout the world&#x27;s oceans. The WHOI fleet includes two large research vessels (&quot;Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Neil Armstrong&quot;), the coastal craft &quot;Tioga&quot;, small research craft such as the dive-operation work boat Echo, the deep-diving human-occupied submersible &quot;Alvin&quot;, the tethered, remotely operated vehicle Jason/Medea, and autonomous underwater vehicles such as the REMUS and SeaBED.

WHOI offers graduate and post-doctoral studies in marine science. There are several fellowship and training programs, and graduate degrees are awarded through a joint program with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). WHOI is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. WHOI also offers public outreach programs and informal education through its Exhibit Center and summer tours. The institution has a volunteer program and a membership program, WHOI Associate.

WHOI shares a library, the MBLWHOI Library, with the Marine Biological Laboratory. The MBLWHOI Library holds print and electronic collections in the biological, biomedical, ecological, and oceanographic sciences. The library also conducts digitization and informatics projects.

On October 1, 2020, Peter B. de Menocal became the institution&#x27;s eleventh president and director.

==History==

In 1927, a National Academy of Sciences committee concluded that it was time to &quot;consider the share of the United States of America in a worldwide program of oceanographic research.&quot; The committee&#x27;s recommendation for establishing a permanent independent research laboratory on the East Coast to &quot;prosecute oceanography in all its branches&quot; led to the founding in 1930 of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

A $2.5 million grant from the Rockefeller Foundation supported the summer work of a dozen scientists, construction of a laboratory building and commissioning of a research vessel, the ketch , whose profile still forms the institution&#x27;s logo.

WHOI grew substantially to support significant defense-related research during World War II, and later began a steady growth in staff, research fleet, and scientific stature. From 1950 to 1956, the director was Dr. Edward &quot;Iceberg&quot; Smith, an Arctic explorer, oceanographer and retired Coast Guard rear admiral.

In 1977 the institution appointed oceanographer John Steele as director, and he served until his retirement in 1989.

On 1 September 1985, a joint French-American expedition led by Jean-Louis Michel of IFREMER and Robert Ballard of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution identified the location of the wreck of , which sank off the coast of Newfoundland 15 April 1912.

On 3 April 2011, within a week of resuming of the search operation for Air France Flight 447, a team led by WHOI, operating full ocean depth autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) owned by the Waitt Institute discovered, by means of sidescan sonar, a large portion of debris field from flight AF447.

In March 2017 the institution effected an open-access policy to make its research publicly accessible online.

In 2019, reported that China&#x27;s hackers had launched cyberattacks on dozens of academic institutions in an attempt to gain information on technology being developed for the United States Navy. Some of the targets included the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The attacks had been underway since at least April 2017.

In August 2024, institution researchers are scheduled, pending approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, to conduct a $10 million ocean alkalinity enhancement experiment partially funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that will release 6,000 gallons of a liquid solution of sodium hydroxide into the ocean 10 miles south of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard in an attempt to remove 20 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

== Military contracting ==
The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution develops technology for the United States Navy, including ocean battlespace sensors, unmanned undersea vehicles, and acoustic navigation and communication systems for operations in the Arctic. The institution is also working on Project Sundance for the Office of Naval Research.

==Awards issued==

<text>A ritual is a sequence of activities involving gestures, words, actions, or revered objects. Rituals may be prescribed by the traditions of a community, including a religious community. Rituals are characterized, but not defined, by formalism, traditionalism, invariance, rule-governance, religious symbolism, and performance.

Rituals are a feature of all known human societies. They include not only the worship rites and sacraments of organized religions and cults, but also rites of passage, atonement and purification rites, oaths of allegiance, dedication ceremonies, coronations and presidential inaugurations, marriages, funerals and more. Even common actions like hand-shaking and saying &quot;hello&quot; may be termed as &quot;rituals&quot;.

The field of ritual studies has seen a number of conflicting definitions of the term. One given by Kyriakidis is that a ritual is an outsider&#x27;s or &quot;etic&quot; category for a set activity (or set of actions) that, to the outsider, seems irrational, non-contiguous, or illogical. The term can be used also by the insider or &quot;emic&quot; performer as an acknowledgement that this activity can be seen as such by the uninitiated onlooker.
In psychology, the term &quot;ritual&quot; is sometimes used in a technical sense for a repetitive behavior systematically used by a person to neutralize or prevent anxiety; it can be a symptom of obsessive–compulsive disorder but obsessive-compulsive ritualistic behaviors are generally isolated activities.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;ritual&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;ritualis,&quot; &quot;that which pertains to &quot;(ritus&quot;)&quot;. In Roman juridical and religious usage, &quot;ritus&quot; was the proven way &quot;(mos)&quot; of doing something, or &quot;correct performance, custom&quot;. The original concept of &quot;ritus&quot; may be related to the Sanskrit &quot;ṛtá&quot; (&quot;visible order)&quot; in Vedic religion, &quot;the lawful and regular order of the normal, and therefore proper, natural and true structure of cosmic, worldly, human and ritual events&quot;. The word &quot;ritual&quot; is first recorded in English in 1570, and came into use in the 1600s to mean &quot;the prescribed order of performing religious services&quot; or more particularly a book of these prescriptions.

== Characteristics ==

There are hardly any limits to the kind of actions that may be incorporated into a ritual. The rites of past and present societies have typically involved special gestures and words, recitation of fixed texts, performance of special music, songs or dances, processions, manipulation of certain objects, use of special dresses, consumption of special food, drink, or drugs, and much more.

Catherine Bell argues that rituals can be characterized by formalism, traditionalism, invariance, rule-governance, sacral symbolism and performance.

=== Formalism ===
Ritual uses a limited and rigidly organized set of expressions which anthropologists call a &quot;restricted code&quot; (in opposition to a more open &quot;elaborated code&quot;). Maurice Bloch argues that ritual obliges participants to use this formal oratorical style, which is limited in intonation, syntax, vocabulary, loudness, and fixity of order. In adopting this style, ritual leaders&#x27; speech becomes more style than content. Because this formal speech limits what can be said, it induces &quot;acceptance, compliance, or at least forbearance with regard to any overt challenge&quot;. Bloch argues that this form of ritual communication makes rebellion impossible and revolution the only feasible alternative. Ritual tends to support traditional forms of social hierarchy and authority, and maintains the assumptions on which the authority is based from challenge.

===Traditionalism===
Rituals appeal to tradition and are generally continued to repeat historical precedent, religious rite, mores, or ceremony accurately. Traditionalism varies from formalism in that the ritual may not be formal yet still makes an appeal to the historical trend. An example is the American Thanksgiving dinner, which may not be formal, yet is ostensibly based on an event from the early Puritan settlement of America. Historians Eric Hobsbawm and Terrence Ranger have argued that many of these are &quot;invented traditions&quot;, such as the rituals of the British monarchy, which invoke &quot;thousand year-old tradition&quot; but whose actual form originate in the late nineteenth century, to some extent reviving earlier forms, in this case medieval, that had been discontinued in the meantime. Thus, the appeal to history is important rather than accurate historical transmission.

=== Invariance ===
Catherine Bell states that ritual is also invariant, implying careful choreography. This is less an appeal to traditionalism than a striving for timeless repetition. The key to invariance is bodily discipline, as in monastic prayer and meditation meant to mold dispositions and moods. This bodily discipline is frequently performed in unison, by groups.

===Rule-governance===
Rituals tend to be governed by rules, a feature somewhat like formalism. Rules impose norms on the chaos of behavior, either defining the outer limits of what is acceptable or choreographing each move. Individuals are held to communally approved customs that evoke a legitimate communal authority that can constrain the possible outcomes. Historically, war in most societies has been bound by highly ritualized constraints that limit the legitimate means by which war was waged.

===Sacral symbolism===
Activities appealing to supernatural beings are easily considered rituals, although the appeal may be quite indirect, expressing only a generalized belief in the existence of the sacred demanding a human response. National flags, for example, may be considered more than signs representing a country. The flag stands for larger symbols such as freedom, democracy, free enterprise or national superiority. Anthropologist Sherry Ortner writes that the flag
Particular objects become sacral symbols through a process of consecration which effectively creates the sacred by setting it apart from the profane. Boy Scouts and the armed forces in any country teach the official ways of folding, saluting and raising the flag, thus emphasizing that the flag should never be treated as just a piece of cloth.

===Performance===
The performance of ritual creates a theatrical-like frame around the activities, symbols and events that shape participant&#x27;s experience and cognitive ordering of the world, simplifying the chaos of life and imposing a more or less coherent system of categories of meaning onto it. As Barbara Myerhoff put it, &quot;not only is seeing believing, doing is believing.&quot;

The theatricality of ritual may overlap with performance art.

==Genres==
For simplicity&#x27;s sake, the range of diverse rituals can be divided into categories with common characteristics, generally falling into one three major categories:
* rites of passage, generally changing an individual&#x27;s social status;
* communal rites, whether of worship, where a community comes together to worship, such as Jewish synagogue or Mass, or of another character, such as fertility rites and certain non-religious festivals;
* rites of personal devotion, where an individual worships, including prayer and pilgrimages, pledges of allegiance, or promises to wed someone.

However, rituals can fall in more than one category or genre, and may be grouped in a variety of other ways. For example, the anthropologist Victor Turner writes:

===Rites of passage===

A rite of passage is a ritual event that marks a person&#x27;s transition from one status to another, including adoption, baptism, coming of age, graduation, inauguration, engagement, and marriage. Rites of passage may also include initiation into groups not tied to a formal stage of life such as a fraternity. Arnold van Gennep stated that rites of passage are marked by three stages:
; 1. Separation: Wherein the initiates are separated from their old identities through physical and symbolic means.
; 2. Transition: Wherein the initiated are &quot;betwixt and between&quot;. Victor Turner argued that this stage is marked by liminality, a condition of ambiguity or disorientation in which initiates have been stripped of their old identities, but have not yet acquired their new one. Turner states that &quot;the attributes of liminality or of liminal &quot;personae&quot; (&quot;threshold people&quot;) are necessarily ambiguous&quot;. In this stage of liminality or &quot;anti-structure&quot; (see below), the initiates&#x27; role ambiguity creates a sense of communitas or emotional bond of community between them. This stage may be marked by ritual ordeals or ritual training.
; 3. Incorporation: Wherein the initiates are symbolically confirmed in their new identity and community.

===Rites of affliction===

Anthropologist Victor Turner defines rites of affliction actions that seek to mitigate spirits or supernatural forces that inflict humans with bad luck, illness, gynecological troubles, physical injuries, and other such misfortunes. These rites may include forms of spirit divination (consulting oracles) to establish causes—and rituals that heal, purify, exorcise, and protect. The misfortune experienced may include individual health, but also broader climate-related issues such as drought or plagues of insects. Healing rites performed by shamans frequently identify social disorder as the cause, and make the restoration of social relationships the cure.

Turner uses the example of the Isoma ritual among the Ndembu of northwestern Zambia to illustrate. The Isoma rite of affliction is used to cure a childless woman of infertility. Infertility is the result of a &quot;structural tension between matrilineal descent and virilocal marriage&quot; (i.e., the tension a woman feels between her mother&#x27;s family, to whom she owes allegiance, and her husband&#x27;s family among whom she must live). &quot;It is because the woman has come too closely in touch with the &#x27;man&#x27;s side&#x27; in her marriage that her dead matrikin have impaired her fertility.&quot; To correct the balance of matrilinial descent and marriage, the Isoma ritual dramatically placates the deceased spirits by requiring the woman to reside with her mother&#x27;s kin.

Shamanic and other ritual may effect a psychotherapeutic cure, leading anthropologists such as Jane Atkinson to theorize how. Atkinson argues that the effectiveness of a shamanic ritual for an individual may depend upon a wider audiences acknowledging the shaman&#x27;s power, which may lead to the shaman placing greater emphasis on engaging the audience than in the healing of the patient.

===Death, mourning, and funerary rites===
Many cultures have rites associated with death and mourning, such as the last rites and wake in Christianity, &quot;shemira&quot; in Judaism, the &quot;antyesti&quot; in Hinduism, and the &quot;antam sanskar&quot; in Sikhism. These rituals often reflect deep spiritual beliefs and provide a structured way for communities to grieve and honor the deceased. In Tibetan Buddhism, for example, the rituals described in the Bardo Thodol guide the soul through the stages of death, aiming for spiritual liberation or enlightenment. In Islam, the Janazah prayer is an essential communal act that underscores the unity of the Muslim community in life and death. Indigenous cultures may have unique practices, such as the Australian Aboriginal smoking ceremony, intended to cleanse the spirit of the departed and ensure a safe journey to the afterlife.

In many traditions can be found the belief that when man was first made the creator bestowed soul upon him, while the earth provided the body. In Genesis is offered the following description of the creation of man: &quot;And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul&quot;. As a result at the moment of death each of the two elements needs to be returned to its source, the body returns to earth, while the soul to the heavenly creator, by means of the funerary ritual. 

===Calendrical and commemorative rites===

Calendrical and commemorative rites are ritual events marking particular times of year, or a fixed period since an important event. Calendrical rituals give social meaning to the passage of time, creating repetitive weekly, monthly or yearly cycles. Some rites are oriented towards a culturally defined moment of change in the climatic cycle, such as solar terms or the changing of seasons, or they may mark the inauguration of an activity such as planting, harvesting, or moving from winter to summer pasture during the agricultural cycle. They may be fixed by the solar or lunar calendar; those fixed by the solar calendar fall on the same day (of the Gregorian, Solar calendar) each year (such as New Year&#x27;s Day on the first of January) while those calculated by the lunar calendar fall on different dates (of the Gregorian, Solar calendar) each year (such as Chinese lunar New Year). Calendrical rites impose a cultural order on nature. Mircea Eliade states that the calendrical rituals of many religious traditions recall and commemorate the basic beliefs of a community, and their yearly celebration establishes a link between past and present, as if the original events are happening over again: &quot;Thus the gods did; thus men do.&quot;

===Rites of sacrifice, exchange, and communion===
This genre of ritual encompasses forms of sacrifice and offering meant to praise, please or placate divine powers. According to early anthropologist Edward Tylor, such sacrifices are gifts given in hope of a return. Catherine Bell, however, points out that sacrifice covers a range of practices from those that are manipulative and &quot;magical&quot; to those of pure devotion. Hindu puja, for example, appear to have no other purpose than to please the deity.

According to Marcel Mauss, sacrifice is distinguished from other forms of offering by being consecrated, and hence sanctified. As a consequence, the offering is usually destroyed in the ritual to transfer it to the deities.

===Rites of feasting, fasting, and festivals===
Rites of feasting and fasting are those through which a community publicly expresses an adherence to basic, shared religious values, rather than to the overt presence of deities as is found in rites of affliction where feasting or fasting may also take place. It encompasses a range of performances such as communal fasting during Ramadan by Muslims; the slaughter of pigs in New Guinea; Carnival festivities; or penitential processions in Catholicism. Victor Turner described this &quot;cultural performance&quot; of basic values a &quot;social drama&quot;. Such dramas allow the social stresses that are inherent in a particular culture to be expressed and worked out symbolically in a ritual catharsis; as the social tensions continue to persist outside the ritual, pressure mounts for the ritual&#x27;s cyclical performance. In Carnival, for example, the practice of masking allows people to be what they are not, and acts as a general social leveller, erasing otherwise tense social hierarchies in a festival that emphasizes play outside the bounds of normal social limits. Yet outside carnival, social tensions of race, class and gender persist, hence requiring the repeated periodic release found in the festival.

===Water rites===

A water rite is a rite or ceremonial custom that uses water as its central feature. Typically, a person is immersed or bathed as a symbol of religious indoctrination or ritual purification. Examples include the Mikveh in Judaism, a custom of purification; misogi in Shinto, a custom of spiritual and bodily purification involving bathing in a sacred waterfall, river, or lake; the Muslim ritual ablution or Wudu before prayer; baptism in Christianity, a custom and sacrament that represents both purification and initiation into the religious community (the Christian Church); and Amrit Sanskar in Sikhism, a rite of passage (sanskar) that similarly represents purification and initiation into the religious community (the khalsa). Rites that use water are not considered water rites if it is not their central feature. For example, having water to drink during or after ritual is common, but does not make that ritual a water ritual unless the drinking of water is a central activity such as in the Church of All Worlds waterkin rite.

===Fertility rites===
===Sexual rituals===
===Political rituals===
According to anthropologist Clifford Geertz, political rituals actually construct power; that is, in his analysis of the , he argued that rituals are not an ornament of political power, but that the power of political actors depends upon their ability to create rituals and the cosmic framework within which the social hierarchy headed by the king is perceived as natural and sacred. As a &quot;dramaturgy of power&quot; comprehensive ritual systems may create a cosmological order that sets a ruler apart as a divine being, as in &quot;the divine right&quot; of European kings, or the divine Japanese Emperor. Political rituals also emerge in the form of uncodified or codified conventions practiced by political officials that cement respect for the arrangements of an institution or role against the individual temporarily assuming it, as can be seen in the many rituals still observed within the procedure of parliamentary bodies.

Ritual can be used as a form of resistance, as for example, in the various Cargo Cults that developed against colonial powers in the South Pacific. In such religio-political movements, Islanders would use ritual imitations of western practices (such as the building of landing strips) as a means of summoning cargo (manufactured goods) from the ancestors. Leaders of these groups characterized the present state (often imposed by colonial capitalist regimes) as a dismantling of the old social order, which they sought to restore. Rituals may also attain political significance after conflict, as is the case with the Bosnian syncretic holidays and festivals that transgress religious boundaries.

==Anthropological theories==
===Functionalism===

Nineteenth century &quot;armchair anthropologists&quot; were concerned with the basic question of how religion originated in human history. In the twentieth century their conjectural histories were replaced with new concerns around the question of what these beliefs and practices did for societies, regardless of their origin. In this view, religion was a universal, and while its content might vary enormously, it served certain basic functions such as the provision of prescribed solutions to basic human psychological and social problems, as well as expressing the central values of a society. Bronislaw Malinowski used the concept of function to address questions of individual psychological needs; A.R. Radcliffe-Brown, in contrast, looked for the function (purpose) of the institution or custom in preserving or maintaining society as a whole. They thus disagreed about the relationship of anxiety to ritual.

Malinowski argued that ritual was a non-technical means of addressing anxiety about activities where dangerous elements were beyond technical control: &quot;magic is to be expected and generally to be found whenever man comes to an unbridgeable gap, a hiatus in his knowledge or in his powers of practical control, and yet has to continue in his pursuit.&quot;. Radcliffe-Brown in contrast, saw ritual as an expression of common interest symbolically representing a community, and that anxiety was felt only if the ritual was not performed. George C. Homans sought to resolve these opposing theories by differentiating between &quot;primary anxieties&quot; felt by people who lack the techniques to secure results, and &quot;secondary (or displaced) anxiety&quot; felt by those who have not performed the rites meant to allay primary anxiety correctly. Homans argued that purification rituals may then be conducted to dispel secondary anxiety.

A.R. Radcliffe-Brown argued that ritual should be distinguished from technical action, viewing it as a structured event: &quot;ritual acts differ from technical acts in having in all instances some expressive or symbolic element in them.&quot; Edmund Leach, in contrast, saw ritual and technical action less as separate structural types of activity and more as a spectrum: &quot;Actions fall into place on a continuous scale. At one extreme we have actions which are entirely profane, entirely functional, technique pure and simple; at the other we have actions which are entirely sacred, strictly aesthetic, technically non-functional. Between these two extremes we have the great majority of social actions which partake partly of the one sphere and partly of the other. From this point of view technique and ritual, profane and sacred, do not denote &quot;types&quot; of action but &quot;aspects&quot; of almost any kind of action.&quot;

====As social control====

The functionalist model viewed ritual as a homeostatic mechanism to regulate and stabilize social institutions by adjusting social interactions, maintaining a group ethos, and restoring harmony after disputes.

Although the functionalist model was soon superseded, later &quot;neofunctional&quot; theorists adopted its approach by examining the ways that ritual regulated larger ecological systems. Roy Rappaport, for example, examined the way gift exchanges of pigs between tribal groups in Papua New Guinea maintained environmental balance between humans, available food (with pigs sharing the same foodstuffs as humans) and resource base. Rappaport concluded that ritual, &quot;...helps to maintain an undegraded environment, limits fighting to frequencies which do not endanger the existence of regional population, adjusts man-land ratios, facilitates trade, distributes local surpluses of pig throughout the regional population in the form of pork, and assures people of high quality protein when they are most in need of it&quot;. Similarly, J. Stephen Lansing traced how the intricate calendar of Hindu Balinese rituals served to regulate the vast irrigation systems of Bali, ensuring the optimum distribution of water over the system while limiting disputes.

====Rebellion====
While most Functionalists sought to link ritual to the maintenance of social order, South African functionalist anthropologist Max Gluckman coined the phrase &quot;rituals of rebellion&quot; to describe a type of ritual in which the accepted social order was symbolically turned on its head. Gluckman argued that the ritual was an expression of underlying social tensions (an idea taken up by Victor Turner), and that it functioned as an institutional pressure valve, relieving those tensions through these cyclical performances. The rites ultimately functioned to reinforce social order, insofar as they allowed those tensions to be expressed without leading to actual rebellion. Carnival is viewed in the same light. He observed, for example, how the first-fruits festival (&quot;incwala&quot;) of the South African Bantu kingdom of Swaziland symbolically inverted the normal social order, so that the king was publicly insulted, women asserted their domination over men, and the established authority of elders over the young was turned upside down.

===Structuralism===
Claude Lévi-Strauss, the French anthropologist, regarded all social and cultural organization as symbolic systems of communication shaped by the inherent structure of the human brain. He therefore argued that the symbol systems are not reflections of social structure as the Functionalists believed, but are imposed on social relations to organize them. Lévi-Strauss thus viewed myth and ritual as complementary symbol systems, one verbal, one non-verbal. Lévi-Strauss was not concerned to develop a theory of ritual (although he did produce a four-volume analysis of myth) but was influential to later scholars of ritual such as Mary Douglas and Edmund Leach.

===Structure and anti-structure===
Victor Turner combined Arnold van Gennep&#x27;s model of the structure of initiation rites, and Gluckman&#x27;s functionalist emphasis on the ritualization of social conflict to maintain social equilibrium, with a more structural model of symbols in ritual. Running counter to this emphasis on structured symbolic oppositions within a ritual was his exploration of the liminal phase of rites of passage, a phase in which &quot;anti-structure&quot; appears. In this phase, opposed states such as birth and death may be encompassed by a single act, object or phrase. The dynamic nature of symbols experienced in ritual provides a compelling personal experience; ritual is a &quot;mechanism that periodically converts the obligatory into the desirable&quot;.

Mary Douglas, a British Functionalist, extended Turner&#x27;s theory of ritual structure and anti-structure with her own contrasting set of terms &quot;grid&quot; and &quot;group&quot; in the book &quot;Natural Symbols&quot;. Drawing on Levi-Strauss&#x27; Structuralist approach, she saw ritual as symbolic communication that constrained social behaviour. Grid is a scale referring to the degree to which a symbolic system is a shared frame of reference. Group refers to the degree people are tied into a tightly knit community. When graphed on two intersecting axes, four quadrants are possible: strong group/strong grid, strong group/weak grid, weak group/weak grid, weak group/strong grid. Douglas argued that societies with strong group or strong grid were marked by more ritual activity than those weak in either group or grid. (see also, section below)

====Anti-structure and communitas====

In his analysis of rites of passage, Victor Turner argued that the liminal phase - that period &#x27;betwixt and between&#x27; - was marked by &quot;two models of human interrelatedness, juxtaposed and alternating&quot;: structure and anti-structure (or &quot;communitas&quot;). While the ritual clearly articulated the cultural ideals of a society through ritual symbolism, the unrestrained festivities of the liminal period served to break down social barriers and to join the group into an undifferentiated unity with &quot;no status, property, insignia, secular clothing, rank, kinship position, nothing to demarcate themselves from their fellows&quot;. These periods of symbolic inversion have been studied in a diverse range of rituals such as pilgrimages and Yom Kippur.

====Social dramas====
Beginning with Max Gluckman&#x27;s concept of &quot;rituals of rebellion&quot;, Victor Turner argued that many types of ritual also served as &quot;social dramas&quot; through which structural social tensions could be expressed, and temporarily resolved. Drawing on Van Gennep&#x27;s model of initiation rites, Turner viewed these social dramas as a dynamic process through which the community renewed itself through the ritual creation of communitas during the &quot;liminal phase&quot;. Turner analyzed the ritual events in 4 stages: breach in relations, crisis, redressive actions, and acts of reintegration. Like Gluckman, he argued these rituals maintain social order while facilitating disordered inversions, thereby moving people to a new status, just as in an initiation rite.

===Symbolic approaches to ritual===
Clifford Geertz also expanded on the symbolic approach to ritual that began with Victor Turner. Geertz argued that religious symbol systems provided both a &quot;model of&quot; reality (showing how to interpret the world as is) as well as a &quot;model for&quot; reality (clarifying its ideal state). The role of ritual, according to Geertz, is to bring these two aspects – the &quot;model of&quot; and the &quot;model for&quot; – together: &quot;it is in ritual – that is consecrated behaviour – that this conviction that religious conceptions are veridical and that religious directives are sound is somehow generated.&quot;

Symbolic anthropologists like Geertz analyzed rituals as language-like codes to be interpreted independently as cultural systems. Geertz rejected Functionalist arguments that ritual describes social order, arguing instead that ritual actively shapes that social order and imposes meaning on disordered experience. He also differed from Gluckman and Turner&#x27;s emphasis on ritual action as a means of resolving social passion, arguing instead that it simply displayed them.

===As a form of communication===
Whereas Victor Turner saw in ritual the potential to release people from the binding structures of their lives into a liberating anti-structure or communitas, Maurice Bloch argued that ritual produced conformity.

Maurice Bloch argued that ritual communication is unusual in that it uses a special, restricted vocabulary, a small number of permissible illustrations, and a restrictive grammar. As a result, ritual utterances become very predictable, and the speaker is made anonymous in that they have little choice in what to say. The restrictive syntax reduces the ability of the speaker to make propositional arguments, and they are left, instead, with utterances that cannot be contradicted such as &quot;I do thee wed&quot; in a wedding. These kinds of utterances, known as performatives, prevent speakers from making political arguments through logical argument, and are typical of what Weber called traditional authority instead.

Bloch&#x27;s model of ritual language denies the possibility of creativity. Thomas Csordas, in contrast, analyzes how ritual language can be used to innovate. Csordas looks at groups of rituals that share performative elements (&quot;genres&quot; of ritual with a shared &quot;poetics&quot;). These rituals may fall along the spectrum of formality, with some less, others more formal and restrictive. Csordas argues that innovations may be introduced in less formalized rituals. As these innovations become more accepted and standardized, they are slowly adopted in more formal rituals. In this way, even the most formal of rituals are potential avenues for creative expression.

===As a disciplinary program===
In his historical analysis of articles on ritual and rite in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, Talal Asad notes that from 1771 to 1852, the brief articles on ritual define it as a &quot;book directing the order and manner to be observed in performing divine service&quot; (i.e., as a script). There are no articles on the subject thereafter until 1910, when a new, lengthy article appeared that redefines ritual as &quot;...a type of routine behaviour that symbolizes or expresses something&quot;. As a symbolic activity, it is no longer confined to religion, but is distinguished from technical action. The shift in definitions from script to behavior, which is likened to a text, is matched by a semantic distinction between ritual as an &quot;outward sign&quot; (i.e., public symbol) and &quot;inward meaning&quot;.

The emphasis has changed to establishing the meaning of public symbols and abandoning concerns with inner emotional states since, as Evans-Pritchard wrote &quot;such emotional states, if present at all, must vary not only from individual to individual, but also in the same individual on different occasions and even at different points in the same rite.&quot; Asad, in contrast, emphasizes behavior and inner emotional states; rituals are to be performed, and mastering these performances is a skill requiring disciplined action.

Drawing on the example of Medieval monastic life in Europe, he points out that ritual in this case refers to its original meaning of the &quot;...book directing the order and manner to be observed in performing divine service&quot;. This book &quot;prescribed practices, whether they had to do with the proper ways of eating, sleeping, working, and praying or with proper moral dispositions and spiritual aptitudes, aimed at developing virtues that are put &#x27;to the service of God.&#x27;&quot; Monks, in other words, were disciplined in the Foucauldian sense. The point of monastic discipline was to learn skills and appropriate emotions. Asad contrasts his approach by concluding:
=== As a form of social solidarity ===
Ethnographic observation shows ritual can create social solidarity. Douglas Foley Went to North Town, Texas, between 1973 and 1974 to study public high school culture. He used interviews, participant observation, and unstructured chatting to study racial tension and capitalist culture in his ethnography &quot;Learning Capitalist Culture&quot;. Foley refers to football games and Friday Night Lights as a community ritual. This ritual united the school and created a sense of solidarity and community on a weekly basis involving pep rallies and the game itself. Foley observed judgement and segregation based on class, social status, wealth, and gender. He described Friday Night Lights as a ritual that overcomes those differences: &quot;The other, gentler, more social side of football was, of course, the emphasis on camaraderie, loyalty, friendship between players, and pulling together&quot;. In his ethnography &quot;Waiting for Elijah: Time and Encounter in a Bosnian Landscape&quot;, anthropologist Safet HadžiMuhamedović suggests that shared festivals like St George&#x27;s Day and St Elijah&#x27;s Day structure interfaith relationships and appear as acts of solidarity against ethno-nationalist purifications of territory in Bosnia.

===Ritualization===
Asad&#x27;s work critiqued the notion that there were universal characteristics of ritual to be found in all cases. Catherine Bell has extended this idea by shifting attention from ritual as a category, to the processes of &quot;ritualization&quot; by which ritual is created as a cultural form in a society. Ritualization is &quot;a way of acting that is designed and orchestrated to distinguish and privilege what is being done in comparison to other, usually more quotidian, activities&quot;.

===Sociobiology and behavioral neuroscience===
Anthropologists have also analyzed ritual via insights from other behavioral sciences. The idea that cultural rituals share behavioral similarities with personal rituals of individuals was discussed early on by Freud. Dulaney and Fiske compared ethnographic descriptions of both rituals and non-ritual doings, such as work to behavioral descriptions from clinical descriptions of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). They note that OCD behavior often consists of such behavior as constantly cleaning objects, concern or disgust with bodily waste or secretions, repetitive actions to prevent harm, heavy emphasis on number or order of actions etc. They then show that ethnographic descriptions of cultural rituals contain around 5 times more of such content than ethnographic descriptions of other activities such as &quot;work&quot;. Fiske later repeated similar analysis with more descriptions from a larger collection of different cultures, also contrasting descriptions of cultural rituals to descriptions of other behavioral disorders (in addition to OCD), in order to show that only OCD-like behavior (not other illnesses) shares properties with rituals. The authors offer tentative explanations for these findings, for example that these behavioral traits are widely needed for survival, to control risk, and cultural rituals are often performed in the context of perceived collective risk.

Other anthropologists have taken these insights further, and constructed more elaborate theories based on the brain functions and physiology. Liénard and Boyer suggest that commonalities between obsessive behavior in individuals and similar behavior in collective contexts possibly share similarities due to underlying mental processes they call hazard precaution. They suggest that individuals of societies seem to pay more attention to information relevant to avoiding hazards, which in turn can explain why collective rituals displaying actions of hazard precaution are so popular and prevail for long periods in cultural transmission.

===Ritual as a methodological measure of religiosity===

According to the sociologist Mervin Verbit, ritual may be understood as one of the key components of religiosity. And ritual itself may be broken down into four dimensions; content, frequency, intensity
and centrality. The content of a ritual may vary from ritual to ritual, as does the frequency of its practice, the intensity of the ritual (how much of an impact it has on the practitioner), and the centrality of the ritual (in that religious tradition).

In this sense, ritual is similar to Charles Glock&#x27;s &quot;practice&quot; dimension of religiosity.

==Religious perspectives==

In religion, a ritual can comprise the prescribed outward forms of performing the &quot;&quot;, or cult, of a particular observation within a religion or religious denomination. Although ritual is often used in context with worship performed in a church, the actual relationship between any religion&#x27;s doctrine and its ritual(s) can vary considerably from organized religion to non-institutionalized spirituality, such as ayahuasca shamanism as practiced by the Urarina of the upper Amazon. Rituals often have a close connection with reverence, thus a ritual in many cases expresses reverence for a deity or idealized state of humanity.

===Christianity===

In Christianity, a rite is used to refer to a sacred ceremony (such as anointing of the sick), which may or may not carry the status of a sacrament depending on the Christian denomination (in Roman Catholicism, anointing of the sick is a sacrament while in Lutheranism it is not). The word &quot;rite&quot; is also used to denote a liturgical tradition usually emanating from a specific center; examples include the Roman Rite, the Byzantine Rite, and the Sarum Rite. Such rites may include various sub-rites. For example, the Byzantine Rite (which is used by the Eastern Orthodox, Eastern Lutheran, and Eastern Catholic churches) has Greek, Russian, and other ethnically based variants.

===Islam===

For daily prayers, practicing Muslims must perform a ritual recitation from the Quran in Arabic while bowing and prostrating. Quranic chapter 2 prescribes rituals such as the direction to face for prayers (qiblah); pilgrimage (Hajj), and fasting in Ramadan. Iḥrām is a state of ritual purity in preparation for pilgrimage in Islam.

Hajj rituals include circumambulation around the Kaʿbah... &quot;and show us our rites&quot; - these rites (manāsik) are presumed the rituals of ḥajj. &quot;Truly Ṣafā and Marwah are among the rituals of God&quot; Saʿy is the ritual travel, partway between walking and running, seven times between the two hills.

==Freemasonry==
In Freemasonry, rituals are scripted words and actions which employ Masonic symbolism to illustrate the principles espoused by Freemasons. These rituals are progressively taught to entrusted members during initiation into a particular Masonic rite comprising a series of degrees conferred by a Masonic body. The degrees of Freemasonry derive from the three grades of medieval craft guilds; those of &quot;Entered Apprentice&quot;, &quot;Journeyman&quot; (or &quot;Fellowcraft&quot;), and &quot;Master Mason&quot;. In North America, Freemasons who have been raised to the degree of &quot;Master Mason&quot; have the option of joining appendant bodies that offer additional degrees to those, such as those of the Scottish Rite or the York Rite.

<text>The Zambezi (also spelled Zambeze and Zambesi) is the fourth-longest river in Africa, the longest east-flowing river in Africa and the largest flowing into the Indian Ocean from Africa. Its drainage basin covers , slightly less than half of the Nile&#x27;s. The river rises in Zambia and flows through eastern Angola, along the north-eastern border of Namibia and the northern border of Botswana, then along the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe to Mozambique, where it crosses the country to empty into the Indian Ocean.

The Zambezi&#x27;s most noted feature is Victoria Falls. Its other falls include the Chavuma Falls at the border between Zambia and Angola and Ngonye Falls near Sioma in western Zambia.

The two main sources of hydroelectric power on the river are the Kariba Dam, which provides power to Zambia and Zimbabwe, and the Cahora Bassa Dam in Mozambique, which provides power to Mozambique and South Africa. Additionally, two smaller power stations are along the Zambezi River in Zambia, one at Victoria Falls and the other in Zengamina, near Kalene Hill in the Ikelenge District.

==Course==

===Origins===
The river rises in a black, marshy dambo in dense, undulating miombo woodland north of Mwinilunga and south of Ikelenge in the Ikelenge District of North-Western Province, Zambia, at about above sea level. The area around the source is a national monument, forest reserve, and important bird area.

Eastward of the source, the watershed between the Congo and Zambezi Basins is a well-marked belt of high ground, running nearly east–west and falling abruptly to the north and south. This distinctly cuts off the basin of the Lualaba (the main branch of the upper Congo) from the Zambezi. In the neighborhood of the source, the watershed is not as clearly defined, but the two river systems do not connect.

The region drained by the Zambezi is a vast, broken-edged plateau 900–1,200 m high, composed in the remote interior of metamorphic beds and fringed with the igneous rocks of the Victoria Falls. At Chupanga, on the lower Zambezi, thin strata of grey and yellow sandstones, with an occasional band of limestone, crop out on the bed of the river in the dry season, and these persist beyond Tete, where they are associated with extensive seams of coal. Coal is also found in the district just below Victoria Falls. Gold-bearing rocks occur in several places.

===Upper Zambezi===
The river flows to the southwest into Angola for about , then is joined by sizeable tributaries such as the Luena and the Chifumage flowing from highlands to the north-west. It turns south and develops a floodplain, with extreme width variation between the dry and rainy seasons. It enters dense evergreen &quot;Cryptosepalum &quot;dry forest, though on its western side, Western Zambezian grasslands also occur. Where it re-enters Zambia, it is nearly wide in the rainy season and flows rapidly, with rapids ending in the Chavuma Falls, where the river flows through a rocky fissure. The river drops about in elevation from its source at to the Chavuma Falls at , over a distance of about . From this point to the Victoria Falls, the level of the basin is very uniform, dropping only by another across a distance of around .

The first of its large tributaries to enter the Zambezi is the Kabompo River in the North-Western Province of Zambia. The savanna through which the river flows gives way to a wide floodplain, studded with &quot;Borassus&quot; fan palms. A little farther south is the confluence with the Lungwebungu River. This is the beginning of the Barotse Floodplain, the most notable feature of the upper Zambezi, but this northern part does not flood so much and includes islands of higher land in the middle.

About 30 km below the confluence of the Lungwebungu, the country becomes very flat, and the typical Barotse Floodplain landscape unfolds, with the flood reaching a width of 25 km in the rainy season. For more than 200 km downstream, the annual flood cycle dominates the natural environment and human life, society, and culture. About 80 km further down, the Luanginga, which with its tributaries drains a large area to the west, joins the Zambezi. A short distance higher up on the east, the main stream is joined in the rainy season by overflow of the Luampa/Luena system.

A short distance downstream of the confluence with the Luanginga is Lealui, one of the capitals of the Lozi people, who populate the Zambian region of Barotseland in the Western Province. The chief of the Lozi maintains one of his two compounds at Lealui; the other is at Limulunga, which is on high ground and serves as the capital during the rainy season. The annual move from Lealui to Limulunga is a major event, celebrated as one of Zambia&#x27;s best-known festivals, the Kuomboka.

After Lealui, the river turns south-southeast. From the east, it continues to receive numerous small streams, but on the west, it is without major tributaries for 240 km. Before this, the Ngonye Falls and subsequent rapids interrupt navigation. South of Ngonye Falls, the river briefly borders Namibia&#x27;s Caprivi Strip. Below the junction of the Cuando River and the Zambezi, the river bends almost due east. Here, the river is broad and shallow and flows slowly, but as it flows eastward towards the border of the great central plateau of Africa, it reaches a chasm into which the Victoria Falls plunge.

===Middle Zambezi===

The Victoria Falls are considered the boundary between the upper and middle Zambezi. Below them, the river continues to flow due east for about , cutting through perpendicular walls of basalt apart in hills high. The river flows swiftly through the Batoka Gorge, the current being continually interrupted by reefs. It has been described as one of the world&#x27;s most spectacular whitewater trips, a tremendous challenge for kayakers and rafters alike. Beyond the gorge are a succession of rapids that end below Victoria Falls. Over this distance, the river drops .

At this point, the river enters Lake Kariba, created in 1959 following the completion of the Kariba Dam. The lake is one of the largest man-made lakes in the world, and the hydroelectric power-generating facilities at the dam provide electricity to much of Zambia and Zimbabwe.

The Luangwa and Kafue rivers are the two largest left-hand tributaries of the Zambezi. The Kafue joins the main river in a quiet, deep stream about wide. From this point, the northward bend of the Zambezi is checked, and the stream continues due east. At the confluence of the Luangwa (15°37&#x27; S), it enters Mozambique.

The middle Zambezi ends where the river enters Lake Cahora Bassa, formerly the site of dangerous rapids known as Kebrabassa; the lake was created in 1974 by the construction of the Cahora Bassa Dam.

===Lower Zambezi===
The lower Zambezi&#x27;s from Cahora Bassa to the Indian Ocean is navigable, although the river is shallow in many places during the dry season. This shallowness arises as the river enters a broad valley and spreads out over a large area. Only at one point, the Lupata Gorge, from its mouth, is the river confined between high hills. Here, it is scarcely wide. Elsewhere it is from wide, flowing gently in many streams. The river bed is sandy, and the banks are low and reed-fringed. At places, however, and especially in the rainy season, the streams unite into one broad, fast-flowing river.

About from the sea, the Zambezi receives the drainage of Lake Malawi through the Shire River. On approaching the Indian Ocean, the river splits up into a delta. Each of the primary distributaries, Kongone, Luabo, and Timbwe, is obstructed by a sand bar. A more northerly branch, called the Chinde mouth, has a minimum depth at low water of at the entrance and further in, and is the branch used for navigation. About further north is a river called the Quelimane, after the town at its mouth. This stream, which is silting up, receives the overflow of the Zambezi in the rainy season.
==Discharge==
Average, minimum and maximum discharge of the Zambezi River at Marromeu (Lower Zambezi). Period from 1998 to 2022.
==Delta==
The delta of the Zambezi is today about half as broad as it was before the construction of the Kariba and Cahora Bassa dams controlled the seasonal variations in the flow rate of the river. Before the dams were built, seasonal flooding of the Zambezi had quite a different impact on the ecosystems of the delta from today, as it brought nutrient-rich fresh water down to the Indian Ocean coastal wetlands. The lower Zambezi experienced a small flood surge early in the dry season as rain in the Gwembe catchment and north-eastern Zimbabwe rushed through while rain in the upper Zambezi, Kafue, and Lake Malawi basins, and Luangwa to a lesser extent, is held back by swamps and floodplains.

The discharges of these systems contribute to a much larger flood in March or April, with a mean monthly maximum for April of per second at the delta. The record flood was more than three times as big, per second being recorded in 1958. By contrast, the discharge at the end of the dry season averaged just per second.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the building of dams changed that pattern completely. Downstream, the mean monthly minimum–maximum was per second; now it is per second. Medium-level floods especially, of the kind to which the ecology of the lower Zambezi was adapted, happen less often and have a shorter duration. As with the Itezhi-Tezhi Dam&#x27;s deleterious effects on the Kafue Flats, this has these effects:
* Fish, bird, and other wildlife feeding and breeding patterns were disrupted.
* Less grassland remains after flooding for grazing wildlife and cattle.
* Traditional farming and fishing patterns were disrupted.

===Ecology of the delta===

The Zambezi Delta has extensive seasonally and permanently flooded grasslands, savannas, and swamp forests. Together with the floodplains of the Buzi, Pungwe, and Save Rivers, the Zambezi&#x27;s floodplains make up the World Wildlife Fund&#x27;s Zambezian coastal flooded savanna ecoregion in Mozambique. The flooded savannas lie close to the Indian Ocean coast. Mangroves fringe the delta&#x27;s shoreline.

Although the dams have stemmed some of the annual flooding of the lower Zambezi and caused the area of floodplain to be greatly reduced, they have not removed flooding completely. They cannot control extreme floods, and they have only made medium-level floods less frequent. When heavy rain in the lower Zambezi combines with significant runoff upstream, massive floods still happen, and the wetlands are still an important habitat. The shrinking of the wetlands, though, resulted in uncontrolled hunting of animals such as buffalo and waterbuck during the Mozambican Civil War.

Although the region has had a reduction in the populations of the large mammals, it is still home to some, including the reedbuck and migrating eland. Carnivores found here include lion (&quot;Panthera leo&quot;), leopard (&quot;Panthera pardus&quot;), cheetah (&quot;Acinonyx jubatus&quot;), spotted hyena (&quot;Crocuta crocuta&quot;), and side-striped jackal (&quot;Canis adustus&quot;). The floodplains are a haven for migratory waterbirds, including pintails, garganey, African openbill (&quot;Anastomus lamelligerus&quot;), saddle-billed stork (&quot;Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis&quot;), wattled crane (&quot;Bugeranus carunculatus&quot;), and great white pelican (&quot;Pelecanus onocrotalus&quot;).

Reptiles include Nile crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus niloticus&quot;), Nile monitor lizard (&quot;Varanus niloticus&quot;), African rock python (&quot;Python sebae&quot;), the endemic Pungwe worm snake (&quot;Leptotyphlops pungwensis&quot;), and three other snakes that are nearly endemic - floodplain water snake (&quot;Lycodonomorphus whytei obscuriventris&quot;), dwarf wolf snake (&quot;Lycophidion nanus&quot;), and swamp viper (&quot;Proatheris&quot;).

Several butterfly species are endemic.
== Climate ==
The north of the Zambezi basin has a mean annual rainfall of 1100 to 1400 mm, which declines towards the south, reaching about half that figure in the south-west. The rain falls in a 4-to-6-month summer rainy season when the Intertropical Convergence Zone moves over the basin from the north between October and March. Evaporation rates are high (1600 mm-2300 mm), and much water is lost this way in swamps and floodplains, especially in the south-west of the basin.

== Wildlife ==
The river supports large populations of many animals. Hippopotamuses are abundant along most of the calm stretches of the river, as well as Nile crocodiles. Monitor lizards are found in many places. Birds are abundant, with species including heron, pelican, egret, lesser flamingo, and African fish eagle present in large numbers. Riverine woodland also supports many large animals, such as buffalo, zebras, giraffes, and elephants.

The Zambezi also supports several hundred species of fish, some of which are endemic to the river. Important species include cichlids, which are fished heavily for food, as well as catfish, tigerfish, yellowfish, and other large species. The bull shark is sometimes known as the Zambezi shark after the river, not to be mistaken with &quot;Glyphis&quot; freshwater shark genus that inhabit the river, as well.

&quot;Source: Beilfuss &amp; Dos Santos (2001)&quot; The Okavango Basin is not included in the figures because it only occasionally overflows to any extent into the Zambezi.

Because of the rainfall distribution, northern tributaries contribute much more water than southern ones; for example: The Northern Highlands catchment of the upper Zambezi contributes 25%, Kafue 8%, Luangwa and Shire Rivers 16% each, total 65% of Zambezi discharge. The large Cuando basin in the south-west, though, contributes only about 2 m3/s because most is lost through evaporation in its swamp systems. The 1940s and 1950s were particularly wet decades in the basin. Since 1975, it has been drier, the average discharge being only 70% of that for the years 1930 to 1958.

== Geological history ==

Up to the Late Pliocene or Pleistocene (more than two million years ago), the upper Zambezi flowed south through what is now the Makgadikgadi Pan to the Limpopo River. The change of the river course is the result of epeirogenic movements that lifted up the surface at the present-day water divide between both rivers.

Meanwhile, east, a western tributary of the Shire River in the East African Rift&#x27;s southern extension through Malawi eroded a deep valley on its western escarpment. At a slow rate, the middle Zambezi started cutting back the bed of its river towards the west, aided by grabens (rift valleys) forming along its course in an east–west axis. As it did so, it captured several south-flowing rivers such as the Luangwa and Kafue.

Eventually, the large lake trapped at Makgadikgadi (or a tributary of it) was captured by the middle Zambezi cutting back towards it, and emptied eastwards. The upper Zambezi was captured, as well. The middle Zambezi was about lower than the upper Zambezi, and a high waterfall formed at the edge of the basalt plateau across which the upper river flows. This was the first Victoria Falls, somewhere down the Batoka Gorge near where Lake Kariba is now.

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
The first European to come across the Zambezi River was Vasco da Gama in January 1498, who anchored at what he called &quot;Rio dos Bons Sinais&quot; (River of Good Omens), now the Quelimane or Quá-Qua, a small river on the northern end of the delta, which at that time was connected by navigable channels to the Zambezi River proper (the connection silted up by the 1830s). In a few of the oldest maps, the entire river is denoted as such. By the 16th century, a new name emerged, the &quot;Cuama&quot; River (sometimes &quot;Quama&quot; or &quot;Zuama&quot;). Cuama was the local name given by the dwellers of the Swahili coast for an outpost located on one of the southerly islands of the delta (near the Luabo channel). Most old nautical maps denote the Luabo entry as Cuama, the entire delta as the &quot;rivers of Cuama&quot;, and the Zambezi proper as the &quot;Cuama River&quot;.

In 1552, Portuguese chronicler João de Barros noted that the same Cuama River was called &quot;Zembere&quot; by the inland people of Monomatapa. The Portuguese Dominican friar João dos Santos, visiting Monomatapa in 1597 reported it as &quot;Zambeze&quot; (Bantu languages frequently shifts between z and r) and inquired into the origins of the name; he was told it was named after a people.


Thus, the term &quot;Zambezi&quot; is after a people who live by a great lake to the north. The most likely candidates are the &quot;M&#x27;biza&quot;, or Bisa people (in older texts given as Muisa, Movisa, Abisa, Ambios, and other variations), a Bantu people who live in what is now central-eastern Zambia, between the Zambezi River and Lake Bangweolo (at the time, before the Lunda invasion, the Bisa would have likely stretched further north, possibly to Lake Tanganyika). The Bisa had a reputation as great cloth traders throughout the region.

In a curious note, Goese-born Portuguese trader Manuel Caetano Pereira, who traveled to the Bisa homelands in 1796, was surprised to be shown a second, separate river referred to as the &quot;Zambezi&quot;. This &quot;other Zambezi&quot; that puzzled Pereira is most likely what modern sources spell the Chambeshi River in northern Zambia.

The Monomatapa notion (reported by Santos) that the Zambezi was sourced from a great internal lake might be a reference to one of the African Great Lakes. One of the names reported by early explorers for Lake Malawi was &quot;Lake Zambre&quot; (probably a corruption of &quot;Zambezi&quot;), possibly because Lake Malawi is connected to the lower Zambezi via the Shire River. The Monomatapa story resonated with the old European notion, drawn from classical antiquity, that all the great African rivers—the Nile, the Senegal, the Congo, and the Zambezi—were all sourced from the same great internal lake. The Portuguese were also told that the Mozambican Espirito Santo &quot;river&quot; (actually an estuary formed by the Umbeluzi, Matola, and Tembe Rivers) was sourced from a lake (hence its outlet became known as Delagoa Bay). As a result, several old maps depict the Zambezi and the &quot;Espirito Santo&quot; Rivers converging deep in the interior, at the same lake.

However, the Bisa-derived etymology is not without dispute. In 1845, W.D. Cooley, examining Pereira&#x27;s notes, concluded the term &quot;Zambezi&quot; derives not from the Bisa people, but rather from the Bantu term &quot;mbege&quot;/&quot;mbeze&quot; (&quot;fish&quot;), and consequently it probably means merely &quot;river of fish&quot;. David Livingstone, who reached the upper Zambezi in 1853, refers to it as &quot;Zambesi&quot;, but also makes note of the local name &quot;Leeambye&quot; used by the Lozi people, which he says means &quot;large river or river par excellence&quot;. Livingstone records other names for the Zambezi—Luambeji, Luambesi, Ambezi, Ojimbesi, and Zambesi—applied by different peoples along its course, and asserts they &quot;all possess a similar signification and express the native idea of this magnificent stream being the main drain of the country&quot;.

Other historical records show that the river was called Kasambabezi by the Tonga people, which means &quot;only those who know the river can bath in it.&quot; a name which is still in use to this day.

In Portuguese records, the &quot;Cuama River&quot; term disappeared and gave way to the term &quot;Sena River&quot; (&quot;Rio de Sena&quot;), a reference to the Swahili (and later Portuguese) upriver trade station at Sena. In 1752, the Zambezi Delta, under the name &quot;Rivers of Sena&quot; (&quot;Rios de Sena&quot;) formed a colonial administrative district of Portuguese Mozambique, but common usage of &quot;Zambezi&quot; led eventually to a royal decree in 1858 officially renaming the district &quot;Zambézia&quot;.

===Exploration===

The Zambezi region was known to medieval geographers as the Empire of Monomotapa, and the course of the river, as well as the position of lakes Ngami and Nyasa, were generally accurate in early maps. These were probably constructed from Arab information.

The first European to visit the inland Zambezi River was the Portuguese &quot;degredado&quot; António Fernandes in 1511 and again in 1513, with the objective of reporting on commercial conditions and activities of the interior of Central Africa. The final report of these explorations revealed the importance of the ports of the upper Zambezi to the local trade system, in particular to East African gold trade.

The first recorded exploration of the upper Zambezi was made by David Livingstone in his exploration from Bechuanaland between 1851 and 1853. Two or three years later, he descended the Zambezi to its mouth and in the course of this journey found the Victoria Falls. During 1858–60, accompanied by John Kirk, Livingstone ascended the river by the Kongone mouth as far as the falls, and also traced the course of its tributary the Shire and reached Lake Malawi.

For the next 35 years, very little exploration of the river took place. Portuguese explorer Serpa Pinto examined some of the western tributaries of the river and made measurements of the Victoria Falls in 1878. In 1884, Scottish-born Plymouth Brethren missionary Frederick Stanley Arnot traveled over the height of land between the watersheds of the Zambezi and the Congo and identified the source of the Zambezi. He considered that the nearby high and cool Kalene Hill was a particularly suitable place for a mission. Arnot was accompanied by Portuguese trader and army officer António da Silva Porto.

In 1889, the Chinde channel north of the main mouths of the river was seen. Two expeditions led by Major A. St Hill Gibbons in 1895 to 1896 and 1898 to 1900 continued the work of exploration begun by Livingstone in the upper basin and central course of the river.
==Economy==
The population of the Zambezi River Valley is estimated to be about 32 million. About 80% of the population of the valley is dependent on agriculture, and the upper river&#x27;s floodplains provide good agricultural land.

Communities by the river fish it extensively, and many people travel from far afield to fish. Some Zambian towns on roads leading to the river levy unofficial &quot;fish taxes&quot; on people taking Zambezi fish to other parts of the country. Game fishing, as well as fishing for food, is a significant activity on some parts of the river. Between Mongu and Livingstone, several safari lodges cater to tourists who want to fish for exotic species, and many also catch fish to sell to aquaria.

The river valley is rich in mineral deposits and fossil fuels, and coal mining is important in places. The dams along its length also provide employment for many people near them, in maintaining the hydroelectric power stations and the dams themselves. Several parts of the river are also very popular tourist destinations. Victoria Falls receives over 100,000 visitors annually, with 141,929 visitors reported in 2015. Mana Pools and Lake Kariba also draw substantial tourist numbers.

==Transport==

The river is frequently interrupted by rapids, so has never been an important long-distance transport route. David Livingstone&#x27;s Zambezi expedition attempted to open up the river to navigation by paddle steamer, but was defeated by the Cahora Bassa rapids.

In the 1930s and 40s, a paddle-barge service operated on the stretch between the Katombora Rapids, about upstream from Livingstone, and the rapids just upstream from Katima Mulilo. Depending on the water level, boats could be paddled through—Lozi paddlers, a dozen or more in a boat, could deal with most of them—or they could be pulled along the shore or carried around the rapids, and teams of oxen pulled barges over land around the Ngonye Falls.

Road, rail, and other crossings of the river, once few and far between, are proliferating. They are, in order from the river&#x27;s source:
* Cazombo road bridge, Angola, bombed in the civil war and not yet reconstructed
* Chinyingi suspension footbridge near the town of Zambezi, a footbridge built as a community project
* Lubosi Imwiko II Bridge linking the towns of Mongu and Kalabo, a 1,005 meter long concrete/steel road bridge including 38.5 km of embanked highway through Barotse Floodplain constructed between 2011 and 2016. It is an extension of the Lusaka–Mongu Road, meant to be a connection between Lusaka and Angola.
* Sioma Bridge near the Ngonye Falls, anew 260 metres long road bridge (K 108 mln), opened in 2016 as part of the M10 Road (Sesheke - Senanga road).
* Katima Mulilo road bridge, , between Namibia and Sesheke in Zambia, opened 2004, completing the Trans–Caprivi Highway connecting Lusaka in Zambia with Walvis Bay on the Atlantic coast
* Kazungula Bridge, opened in 2021, connecting Zambia and Botswana
* Victoria Falls Bridge (road and rail), the first to be built, completed in April 1905 and initially intended as a link in Cecil Rhodes&#x27; scheme to build a railway from Cape Town to Cairo: long
* Kariba Dam carries the paved Kariba/Siavonga highway across the river

* Otto Beit Bridge at Chirundu, road, , 1939
* Second Chirundu Bridge, road, , 2002
* Tete Suspension Bridge, road bridge
* Dona Ana Bridge, railway bridge in Mozambique
* Caia Bridge, opened in 2009

A number of small ferries cross the river in Angola, western Zambia, and Mozambique, notably between Mongu and Kalabo. Above Mongu in years following poor rainy seasons, the river can be forded at one or two places. In tourist areas, such as Victoria Falls and Kariba, short-distance tourist boats take visitors along the river.

==Ecology==
===Pollution===
Sewage effluent is a major cause of water pollution around urban areas, as inadequate water-treatment facilities in all the major cities of the region release untreated sewage into the river. This has resulted in eutrophication of the river water and has facilitated the spread of diseases of poor hygiene such as cholera, typhus, and dysentery.

===Effects of dams===
The construction of two major dams regulating the flow of the river has had a major effect on wildlife and human populations in the lower Zambezi region. When the Cahora Bassa Dam was completed in 1973, its managers allowed it to fill in a single flood season, going against recommendations to fill over at least two years. The drastic reduction in the flow of the river led to a 40% reduction in the coverage of mangroves, greatly increased erosion of the coastal region and a 60% reduction in the catch of prawns off the mouth because of the reduction in emplacement of silt and associated nutrients. Wetland ecosystems downstream of the dam shrank considerably. Wildlife in the delta was further threatened by uncontrolled hunting during the civil war in Mozambique.

===Conservation measures===
The proposed Kavango–Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area was to cover parts of Zambia, Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana, including the Okavango Delta in Botswana and Victoria Falls. Funding was boosted for cross-border conservation along the Zambezi in 2008. The project received a grant of €8 million from a German nongovernmental organisation. Part of the funds are to be used for research in areas covered by the project. However, Angola has warned that landmines from their civil war may impede the project.

The river currently passes through Ngonye Falls National Park, Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park, and Lower Zambezi National Park (in Zambia), and the Zambezi National Park, Victoria Falls National Park, Matusadona National Park, Mana Pools National Park, and the Middle Zambezi Biosphere Reserve (in Zimbabwe).

===Fish stocks management===
As of 2017, the situation of overfishing in the upper Zambezi and its tributaries was considered dire, in part because of weak enforcement of the respective fisheries acts and regulations. The fish stocks of Lake Liambezi in the eastern Caprivi Strip were found to be depleted, and surveys indicated a decline in the whole Zambezi-Kwando-Chobe River system. Illegal fishing (by foreign nationals employed by Namibians) and commercially minded individuals, exploited the resources to the detriment of local markets and the communities whose culture and economy depend on these resources.

Namibian officials have consequently banned monofilament nets and imposed a closing period of about 3 months every year to allow the fish to breed. They also appointed village fish guards and the Kayasa Channel in the Impalila conservancy area was declared a fisheries reserve. The Namibian ministry also promotes aquaculture and plans to distribute thousands of fingerlings to registered small-scale fish farmers of the region.

===EUS outbreak===
In September 2007, epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS) killed hundreds of sore-covered fish in the river. Zambia agriculture minister Ben Kapita asked experts to investigate the outbreak to probe the cause to find out if the disease can be transmitted to humans.

==Major towns==
Along much of the river&#x27;s length, the population is sparse, but important towns and cities along its course include:
* Katima Mulilo (Namibia)
* Livingstone, Mongu, Lukulu, Senanga and Sesheke (Zambia)
* Victoria Falls and Kariba (Zimbabwe)
* Songo and Tete (Mozambique)
* Cazombo (Angola)

<text>Bure Marshes National Nature Reserve is a national nature reserve (NNR) in Norfolk, England. Created in 1958, the reserve covers 451.5 hectares of wetland within the floodplain of the River Bure. 

The reserve contains multiple wetland habitats including broads, dykes, reed beds, fens, and wet woodlands. Most of the woodlands are less than 100 years old. Broads are shallow lakes that formed from medieval peat excavations that flooded in around the 14th century. There are four broads in Bure Marshes NNR, Hoveton Great Broad, Ranworth Broad, Cockshoot Broad, and Decoy Broad.

The reserve contains several rare species of plants including water soldier, milk parsley, and marsh pea. The wetlands serve as habitat for many birds such as kingfishers and great crested grebes. They are also visited by ospreys, as well as many migratory birds including marsh harriers, bitterns, and bearded tits. The wetlands are also home to insects such as swallowtail butterflies, and many species of dragonflies including the rare Norfolk hawker dragonfly. Water voles, otters, grass snakes, and common frogs live in the water.

Bure Marshes NNR is contained within the boundaries of Broads National Park, the Bure Broads and Marshes SSSI, The Broads Special Area of Conservation, and the Broadland Special Protection Area which is a Ramsar site. Within the Bure Marshes NNR, Hoveton Great Broad and the Woodbastwick Marshes are managed by Natural England, while Ranworth Broad and the Ebb and Flow Marshes are managed by Norfolk Wildlife Trust.

<text>The Everly Brothers were an American rock duo, known for steel-string acoustic guitar playing and close harmony singing. Consisting of Isaac Donald &quot;Don&quot; Everly and Phillip &quot;Phil&quot; Everly, the duo combined elements of rock and roll, country, and pop, becoming pioneers of country rock.

Don and Phil Everly were raised in a musical family. As children in the 1940s, they appeared on radio in Iowa singing with their parents as &quot;The Everly Family&quot;. During their high school years in Knoxville, they performed on radio and television. The brothers gained the attention of Chet Atkins, who began to promote them. They began writing and recording their own music in 1956. The brothers&#x27; first hit song was &quot;Bye Bye Love,&quot; which hit No. 1 in the spring of 1957. Additional hits, including &quot;Wake Up Little Susie,&quot; &quot;All I Have to Do Is Dream,&quot; and &quot;Problems&quot;, would follow through 1958. In 1960, they signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded &quot;Cathy&#x27;s Clown,&quot; which was their biggest-selling single. The brothers enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve in 1961 and their output dropped off, though additional hit singles continued through 1962. Their final top 10 hit was &quot;That&#x27;s Old Fashioned (That&#x27;s the Way Love Should Be)&quot;.

The Everly Brothers experienced a decline in popularity in the United States in the 1960s due to changing tastes in popular music, long-simmering disputes with Acuff-Rose Music CEO Wesley Rose, and increased drug use by the brothers. However, the duo continued to release hit singles in the U.K. and Canada and had many successful tours in the 1960s. In the early 1970s, the brothers began releasing solo recordings; they ended their musical partnership in 1973. In 1983, the Everly Brothers reunited. They continued to perform periodically until the death of Phil Everly in 2014.

The Everly Brothers had a major influence on the music of the generation that followed them. Many of the top acts of the 1960s were heavily influenced by the close-harmony singing and acoustic guitar playing of the Everly Brothers; those acts included the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Bee Gees, and Simon &amp; Garfunkel. In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the Everly Brothers No. 1 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time. The brothers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of the inaugural class of 1986 and into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2001. Don Everly was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2019, earning the organization&#x27;s first Iconic Riff Award for his distinctive rhythm guitar intro on &quot;Wake Up Little Susie.&quot;

==History==

===Family and education===
Don was born in Brownie, Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, on February 1, 1937, and Phil in Chicago, Illinois, on January 19, 1939. Their parents were Isaac Milford &quot;Ike&quot; Everly Jr. (1908–1975), a guitar player, and Margaret Embry Everly (1919–2021). Don and Phil were of German, English and Cherokee descent. Actor James Best (born Jewel Guy), also from Muhlenberg County, was a first cousin, the son of Ike&#x27;s sister.

Margaret was 15 when she married Ike, who was 26. Ike worked in coal mines from age 14, but his father encouraged him to pursue his love of music and Ike and Margaret began singing together. The Everly brothers spent most of their childhood in Shenandoah, Iowa. They attended Longfellow Elementary School in Waterloo, Iowa, for a year but then moved to Shenandoah in 1944, where they remained through early high school. Ike Everly had a music show on KMA and KFNF in Shenandoah in the mid-1940s, 

The family moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1953, where the brothers attended West High School (Knoxville, Tennessee). In 1955, the family moved to Madison, Tennessee, while the brothers moved to Nashville, Tennessee. Don had graduated from high school in 1955, and Phil attended Peabody Demonstration School in Nashville, from which he graduated in 1957. Both could now focus on recording.

===Early career (1940s-1950s)===

As children, Don and Phil Everly sang on KMA and KFNF in Shenandoah as &quot;Little Donnie and Baby Boy Phil&quot;. The brothers also sang on radio with their parents as the Everly Family.

While in Knoxville, the brothers found work performing on Cas Walker’s Farm and Home Hour, a regional radio and TV variety program. The brothers caught the attention of family friend Chet Atkins, manager of the RCA Victor studios in Nashville. Shortly thereafter, their mother moved the family to Nashville. Despite affiliation with RCA Victor, Atkins somehow arranged for the Everly Brothers to record for Columbia Records in early 1956. Their &quot;Keep a-Lovin&#x27; Me&quot;, which Don wrote and composed, flopped, and they were dropped from the Columbia label.

Atkins introduced the Everly Brothers to Wesley Rose, of Acuff-Rose music publishers. Rose told them he would secure them a recording deal if they signed to Acuff-Rose as songwriters. They signed in late 1956, and in 1957 Rose introduced them to Archie Bleyer, who was looking for artists for his Cadence Records. The Everlys signed and made a recording in February 1957. &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; had been rejected by 30 other acts. Their record reached No. 2 on the pop charts, behind Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear&quot;, and No. 1 on the country and No. 5 on the R&amp;B charts. The song, by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, became the Everly Brothers&#x27; first million-seller.
Working with the Bryants, they had hits in the United States and the United Kingdom, the biggest being &quot;Wake Up Little Susie&quot;, &quot;All I Have to Do Is Dream&quot;, &quot;Bird Dog&quot;, and &quot;Problems&quot;. The Everlys, though they were largely interpretive artists, also succeeded as songwriters, especially with Don&#x27;s &quot;(Till) I Kissed You&quot;, which hit No. 4 on the US pop charts.

The brothers toured with Buddy Holly in 1957 and 1958. According to Holly&#x27;s biographer Philip Norman, they were responsible for persuading Holly and the Crickets to change their outfits from Levi&#x27;s and T-shirts to the Everlys&#x27; Ivy League suits. Don said Holly wrote and composed &quot;Wishing&quot; for them. &quot;We were all from the South&quot;, Phil observed of their commonalities. &quot;We&#x27;d started in country music.&quot; Although some sources say Phil Everly was one of Holly&#x27;s pallbearers in February 1959, Phil said in 1986 that he attended the funeral and sat with Holly&#x27;s family, but was not a pallbearer. Don did not attend, saying, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t go to the funeral. I couldn&#x27;t go anywhere. I just took to my bed.&quot;

===Mid-career (1960s–1973)===

After three years on Cadence, the Everlys signed with Warner Bros. Records in 1960, where they recorded for 10 years. Their first Warner Bros. hit, 1960&#x27;s &quot;Cathy&#x27;s Clown&quot;, which they wrote and composed themselves, sold eight million copies and became the duo&#x27;s biggest-selling record. &quot;Cathy&#x27;s Clown&quot; was number WB1, the first selection Warner Bros. Records ever released in the United Kingdom.
Other successful Warner Bros. singles followed in the United States, such as &quot;So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad)&quot; (1960, pop No. 7), &quot;Walk Right Back&quot; (1961, pop No. 7), &quot;Crying in the Rain&quot; (1962, pop No. 6), and &quot;That&#x27;s Old Fashioned&quot; (1962, pop No. 9, their last top 10 hit). From 1960 to 1962, Cadence Records released Everly Brothers singles from the vaults, including &quot;When Will I Be Loved&quot; (pop No. 8), written and composed by Phil, and &quot;Like Strangers&quot;.

In the UK, they had 18 singles into the top 40 with Warner Bros. in the 1960s, including a string of top 10 hits through 1965 that featured &quot;Lucille&quot;/&quot;So Sad&quot; (1960, No. 4), &quot;Walk Right Back&quot;/&quot;Ebony Eyes&quot; (1961, No. 1), &quot;Temptation&quot; (1961, No. 1), &quot;Cryin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1962, No. 6) and &quot;The Price of Love&quot; (1965, No. 2).

By 1962, records by the Everlys had reportedly generated $35 million in sales. In 1961, the brothers had a falling out with Wesley Rose during the recording of &quot;Temptation&quot;. Rose was reportedly upset that the Everlys were recording a song which he had not published and, hence, for which he would not be paid any publishing royalties. Rose made efforts to block the record&#x27;s release. The Everlys held firm to their position, and as a result, in the early 1960s, they were shut off from Acuff-Rose songwriters. These included Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, who had written and composed most of their hits, as well as the Everlys themselves, who were still contracted to Acuff-Rose as songwriters and had written several of their own hits. From 1961 through early 1964, the Everlys recorded songs by other composers to avoid paying any royalties to Acuff-Rose. They used the pseudonym &quot;Jimmy Howard&quot; as writer or arranger on two selections they wrote and recorded during this time. This ruse, however, was ultimately unsuccessful, as Acuff-Rose gained legal possession of the copyrights once the deception was discovered.
Around this time, the brothers also set up their own record label, Calliope Records, for solo projects. Using the pseudonym &quot;Adrian Kimberly&quot;, Don recorded a big-band instrumental version of Edward Elgar&#x27;s first &quot;Pomp and Circumstance&quot; march, which Neal Hefti arranged and which charted in the United States top 40 in mid-1961. Further instrumental singles credited to Kimberly followed, but none of those charted. Phil formed the Keestone Family Singers, which featured Glen Campbell and Carole King. Their lone single, &quot;Melodrama&quot;, failed to chart, and by the end of 1962, Calliope Records had gone out of business.
The Everly Brothers&#x27; last United States top 10 hit was 1962&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s Old Fashioned (That&#x27;s The Way Love Should Be)&quot;, a song recorded but unreleased by The Chordettes and given to the brothers by their old mentor, Archie Bleyer.

In succeeding years the Everly Brothers sold fewer records in the United States. Their enlistments in the United States Marine Corps Reserve in October 1961 took them out of the spotlight. One of their few performances during their Marine Corps service was on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, on February 18, 1962, when they performed &quot;Jezebel&quot; and &quot;Crying in the Rain&quot; while outfitted in their Marine uniforms.

Following their discharges from active duty, the Everlys resumed their career, but with little success in the United States. Of their 27 singles on Warner Bros. from 1963 through 1970, only three made the Billboard Hot 100, and none peaked higher than No. 31. Album sales were also down. The Everlys&#x27; first two albums for Warners (in 1960 and 1961) peaked at No. 9 US, but after that, of a dozen more LPs for Warner Bros., only one made the top 200 – 1965&#x27;s &quot;Beat &amp; Soul&quot;, which peaked at No. 141.

The Everlys&#x27; dispute with Acuff-Rose lasted until 1964, when they resumed writing and composing as well as working with the Bryants. By then, however, both of the brothers were addicted to amphetamines. Don&#x27;s condition was worse, as he was taking Ritalin; his addiction lasted three years, until he suffered a nervous breakdown and was hospitalized for treatment. The mainstream media did not report either brothers&#x27; addiction. When Don collapsed in England in mid-October 1962, reporters were told he had food poisoning; when the tabloids suggested he had taken an overdose of pills, his wife and his brother insisted he was suffering physical and nervous exhaustion. Don&#x27;s poor health ended their British tour; he returned to the United States, leaving Phil to carry on with Joey Page, their bass player, taking Don&#x27;s place.

Though their U.S. stardom had begun to wane two years before the British Invasion in 1964, their appeal was still strong in Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. The Everlys remained successful in the United Kingdom and Canada for most of the 1960s, reaching the top 40 in the United Kingdom through 1968 and the top 10 in Canada as late as 1967. The 1966 album &quot;Two Yanks in England&quot; was recorded in England with the Hollies, who also wrote many of the album&#x27;s songs. The Everlys&#x27; final U.S. top 40 hit, &quot;Bowling Green&quot;, was released in 1967.

By the end of the 1960s, the brothers had returned to country rock, and their 1968 album, &quot;Roots&quot;, was hailed by some retrospective critics as &quot;one of the finest early country-rock albums&quot;. However, by the end of the 1960s, the Everly Brothers had ceased to be hitmakers in either North America or the UK, and in 1970, following an unsuccessful live album (&quot;The Everly Brothers Show&quot;), their ten-year contract with Warner Bros. lapsed. They were the summer replacement hosts for Johnny Cash&#x27;s ABC-TV television show in 1970; their variety program, &quot;Johnny Cash Presents the Everly Brothers&quot;, featured Linda Ronstadt and Stevie Wonder.

In 1970, Don released his first solo album, which was unsuccessful. The brothers resumed performing in 1971 and issued two albums for RCA Records in 1972 and 1973. Lindsey Buckingham joined and toured with them in 1972. The Everlys announced their final performance would take place on July 14, 1973, at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm in Buena Park, California, but tensions between the two surfaced and Don told a reporter he was tired of being an Everly Brother. During the show, Phil smashed his guitar and walked off. Don performed solo the following night, commenting to the audience &quot;The Everly Brothers died ten years ago&quot;. The two would not reunite musically for more than ten years.

===Solo years (1973–1983)===
Phil and Don pursued solo careers from 1973 to 1983. Don found some success on the US country charts in the mid- to late-1970s, in Nashville with his band, Dead Cowboys, and playing with Albert Lee. Don also performed solo at an annual country music festival in London in mid-1976. His appearance was well received, and he was given &quot;thunderous applause&quot;, even though critics noted that the performance was uneven.

Phil sang backup for Roy Wood&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Mustard&quot; and two songs for Warren Zevon&#x27;s 1976 self-titled album. While Zevon was part of Phil Everly&#x27;s back-up band, Phil also suggested the title and subject matter for Zevon&#x27;s breakthrough hit single &quot;Werewolves of London&quot;.

Don recorded &quot;Everytime You Leave&quot; with Emmylou Harris on her 1979 album &quot;Blue Kentucky Girl&quot;.

Phil recorded more frequently, but with no chart success until the 1980s. He wrote &quot;Don&#x27;t Say You Don&#x27;t Love Me No More&quot; for the 1978 Clint Eastwood comedy film &quot;Every Which Way But Loose&quot;, which he performed as a duet with the film&#x27;s co-star Sondra Locke. Phil also wrote &quot;One Too Many Women In Your Life&quot; for the 1980 sequel, &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot;, and played in the band which backed Locke.

In 1983, Phil had UK success as a solo artist with the album &quot;Phil Everly&quot;, recorded mainly in London. Musicians on the LP included Dire Straits guitarist Mark Knopfler, Rockpile and Dire Straits drummer Terry Williams, and keyboard player Pete Wingfield. The track &quot;She Means Nothing to Me&quot;, written and composed by John David Williams and featuring Cliff Richard as co-lead vocalist, was a UK Top 10 hit, and &quot;Louise&quot;, written and composed by Ian Gomm, reached the Top 50 in 1983.

===Reunion and later career (1983–2005)===
The brothers&#x27; reunion concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London on September 23, 1983, which ended their ten-year-long solo careers, was initiated by Phil and Don alongside Terry Slater, with Wingfield as musical director. This concert was recorded for a live LP and video broadcast on cable television in mid-January 1984. The brothers returned to the studio as a duo for the first time in over a decade, recording the album &quot;EB &#x27;84&quot;, produced by Dave Edmunds. The lead single, &quot;On the Wings of a Nightingale&quot;, written by Paul McCartney, was a success (Top 10 adult contemporary) and returned them to the US Hot 100 (for their last appearance) and the UK charts. McCartney made his esteem for the duo explicit, saying, &quot;When John and I started to write songs, I was Phil and he was Don.&quot;
Their final charting single was 1986&#x27;s &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;, from the album of the same name. They collaborated with other performers, mostly singing either backup vocals or duets, including additional vocals on the title track of Paul Simon&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;Graceland&quot;. In 1990, Phil recorded a duet with Dutch singer René Shuman. &quot;On Top of the World&quot; was written and composed by Phil, who appeared in the music video they recorded in Los Angeles. The selection appeared on Shuman&#x27;s album &quot;Set the Clock on Rock&quot;. A 1981 live BBC recording of &quot;All I Have to Do Is Dream&quot;, which featured Cliff Richard and Phil sharing vocals, was a UK Top 20 hit in 1994.

In 1998, the brothers recorded &quot;Cold&quot; for Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s and Jim Steinman&#x27;s musical &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot;, and the recording was used in stage versions as source music. It was the final studio recording the Everly Brothers would make as a duo.

The brothers joined Simon &amp; Garfunkel in their &quot;Old Friends&quot; reunion tour of 2003 and 2004. As a tribute to the Everly Brothers, Simon &amp; Garfunkel opened their own show and had the Everlys come out in the middle of it. The live album &quot;Old Friends: Live on Stage&quot; contains Simon &amp; Garfunkel discussing the Everlys&#x27; influence on their career and features all four on &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot;; the subsequent DVD features two extra solo performances by the Everlys. This was not the first time Paul Simon had performed with his heroes; in 1986, the Everlys had sung background vocals on the title track of Simon&#x27;s album &quot;Graceland&quot;. Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s 1981 &quot;Concert in Central Park&quot; featured their interpretation of the Everlys&#x27; &quot;Wake Up, Little Susie&quot;.

Phil Everly sang &quot;Sweet Little Corrina&quot; with country singer Vince Gill on his 2006 album &quot;These Days&quot;. Everly had previously supplied harmony vocals on JD Souther&#x27;s &quot;White Rhythm and Blues&quot; on his (Souther&#x27;s) 1979 album &quot;You&#x27;re Only Lonely&quot;.

===Later developments===
Don Everly attended the Annual Music Masters as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame paid homage to the Everly Brothers on October 25, 2014. Don took the State Theater stage and performed the Everlys&#x27; classic hit &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot;. His final performance was a guest appearance with Paul Simon on Simon&#x27;s 2018 farewell tour in Nashville. Don and Simon performed “Bye Bye Love”, with Simon on Phil Everly&#x27;s original tenor harmony.

Don Everly publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton for the 2016 presidential election in January of that year. This marked the first time he had ever publicly supported a political candidate. Don stated that after his brother Phil&#x27;s death, he felt free to express his views more openly, noting that the brothers&#x27; opposing views had made it impossible for them to lend active support to political candidates.

===Deaths===
Phil Everly died at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, on January 3, 2014, aged 74, of lung disease. Patti Everly blamed her husband&#x27;s death on his smoking habit, which caused him to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; she stated that Phil had spent his final years having to carry oxygen tanks with him wherever he went and taking 20 different types of medication per day.

In a 2014 interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Don Everly said that he had given up smoking in the late 1960s and that Phil had stopped too. However, Don indicated that Phil had resumed smoking during their breakup and had continued until 2001. Don said that weak lungs ran in the family, as their father, Ike, had died of black lung disease. Don admitted that he had lived &quot;a very difficult life&quot; with his brother and that he and Phil had become estranged once again in their later years. Don attributed their estrangement to &quot;their vastly different views on politics and life&quot;, with music being the one thing they shared closely. Don said, &quot;it&#x27;s almost like we could read each other&#x27;s minds when we sang&quot;. However, Don also stated that he had not gotten over Phil&#x27;s death: &quot;I always thought about him every day, even when we were not speaking to each other. It still just shocks me that he&#x27;s gone&quot;. Don added that because he was the older brother, he had always believed he would die before Phil. In a 2016 interview, Don said he was still coping with the loss of Phil and that he had kept some of his brother&#x27;s ashes in his home. He added that he would pick up the ashes every morning and say &quot;good morning&quot;, admitting that it was a peculiar ritual.

Don died at his home in Nashville on August 21, 2021, at the age of 84.

==Style and influences==

The Everly Brothers&#x27; music fused elements of rock and roll, country and pop. Their style has been classified as country rock, rock and roll, rockabilly and country. The duo are retrospectively considered to be pioneers of country rock. Don and Phil, both guitarists, used vocal harmony mostly based on diatonic thirds. On most recordings, Don sang the baritone part and Phil the tenor harmony. One notable exception is &quot;Since You Broke My Heart&quot; (1958). Although Don was mainly low, and Phil was mainly high, their voices overlap in a very intricate and almost subtle fashion. Another notable example is &quot;I&#x27;ll See Your Light&quot; (1977), which is one of the few songs in which Phil consistently has the low harmony while Don is consistently high. Don usually sang the solo lines (for example, the verses of &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot;); among the few exceptions is the 1965 single &quot;It&#x27;s All Over&quot;, on which Phil sang the song&#x27;s solo lines.

==Legacy==
In the late 1950s, the Everly Brothers were the rock and roll youth movement&#x27;s addition to close harmony vocal groups, many of which were family bands. They influenced rock groups of the 1960s, with such major acts as The Beatles, The Beach Boys, and Simon &amp; Garfunkel performing Everly songs as part of their early musical development.

The music of the Everly Brothers influenced the Beatles. Among other indications of the influence, they based the vocal arrangement of &quot;Please Please Me&quot; on &quot;Cathy&#x27;s Clown&quot;. McCartney also referred to &#x27;Phil and Don&#x27; in the lyrics to &quot;Let &#x27;Em In&quot; from the 1976 album &quot;Wings at the Speed of Sound&quot;.

Keith Richards called Don Everly &quot;one of the finest rhythm [guitar] players&quot;.

Paul Simon, who worked with the pair on the song &quot;Graceland&quot;, said on the day after Phil&#x27;s death, &quot;Phil and Don were the most beautiful sounding duo I ever heard. Both voices pristine and soulful. The Everlys were there at the crossroads of country and R&amp;B. They witnessed and were part of the birth of rock and roll.&quot;

===Achievements and honors===
The Everly Brothers had 35 Billboard Top 100 singles, 26 in the top 40. They hold the record for the most Top 100 singles by any duo and trail only Hall &amp; Oates for the most Top 40 singles by a duo. In the UK, they had 30 chart singles, 29 in the Top 40, 13 Top 10, and 4 at No. 1 between 1957 and 1984. They had 12 Top 40 albums between 1960 and 2009.

The Everly Brothers were among the first 10 artists inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986. They were introduced by Neil Young, who observed that every musical group he had ever belonged to had tried, and failed, to copy the Everly Brothers&#x27; harmonies. On July 5, 1986, the Everlys returned to Shenandoah, Iowa, for a concert, parade, street dedication, class reunion, and other activities. Concert fees were donated to the Everly Family Scholarship Fund, which gives scholarships to middle school and high school students in Shenandoah. The brothers were inducted into the Iowa Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Hall of Fame in 2003.

In 1997, the brothers were awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. They were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2001 and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004. Their contribution to music has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. On October 2, 1986, The Everly Brothers received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their work in the music industry, located at 7000 Hollywood Blvd. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked the Everly Brothers No. 33 on its list of the &quot;100 greatest artists of all time&quot;. They are also No. 43 on the list of UK Best selling singles artists of all time.

===Tributes and interpretations by other artists===
The Everlys, as noted above, wrote and composed &quot;Till I Kissed You&quot; (Don), &quot;When Will I Be Loved&quot; (Phil), &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; (Don), and &quot;Cathy&#x27;s Clown&quot; (Don, or possibly Don and Phil). The authorship of &quot;Cathy&#x27;s Clown&quot; has been the subject of a 2017 lawsuit and has been differently adjudicated by different courts, most recently in 2021. &quot;Cathy&#x27;s Clown&quot; and &quot;When Will I Be Loved&quot; became hits for Reba McEntire and Linda Ronstadt, respectively. &quot;Cathy&#x27;s Clown&quot; was also covered by the Tarney/Spencer Band and released as a single in 1979. Band member Alan Tarney (a former member of the Shadows) went on to be a producer for Cliff Richard and a-ha, the Norwegian band who, in turn, covered &quot;Crying in the Rain&quot; in 1990 for its fourth album, &quot;East of the Sun, West of the Moon&quot;.

On Labor Day weekend 1988, Central City, Kentucky, began the Everly Brothers Homecoming event to raise money for a scholarship fund for Muhlenberg County students. Don and Phil toured the United Kingdom in the 1980s and as recently as 2005, and Phil appeared in 2007 on recordings with Vince Gill and Bill Medley. 2007 also saw Alison Krauss and former Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant release &quot;Raising Sand&quot;, which included a cover of the Everlys&#x27; 1964 hit &quot;Gone, Gone, Gone&quot;, produced by T-Bone Burnett. In 2007, Anthony Kiedis, singer for Red Hot Chili Peppers, named his son Everly Bear Kiedis in honor of The Everly Brothers who he cited as one of his favorite groups.

Four Everly Brothers tribute records were released in 2013: Billie Joe Armstrong&#x27;s and Norah Jones&#x27; &quot;Foreverly&quot;, the Chapin Sisters&#x27; &quot;A Date with the Everly Brothers&quot;, Bonnie Prince Billy&#x27;s and Dawn McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;What the Brothers Sang&quot;, and the Wieners&#x27; &quot;Bird Dogs&quot;.

The album &quot;Marvin, Welch &amp; Farrar&quot; (1971), by the British-Australian band of the same name, contains a track named after Don&#x27;s place of birth, &quot;Brownie Kentucky&quot;.

Deerhunter&#x27;s &quot;Basement Scene&quot; &quot;intentionally nods to the Everly Brothers&#x27; &#x27;All I Have To Do Is Dream&#x27;&quot;.

<doc id="102945" wikidata="Q1438597" url="?curid=102945" title="Fort Lewis College">
<text>Fort Lewis College (FLC) is a public liberal arts college in Durango, Colorado, and the only four-year and graduate studies institution in the Four Corners region. FLC&#x27;s historical evolution spans its origins as a U.S. military fort, an Indian boarding school, and eventually a public college.

In accordance with a 1911 mandate, Fort Lewis College provides tuition-free education to qualified Native American Tribal and Alaska Native Village members. The college serves a diverse community comprising 37% Native American/Alaska Native learners, representing 166 Native American Tribes and Alaska Native Villages, 43% first-generation students, 42% Pell Grant recipients, and 15% Hispanic/Latinx students.

In 2008, the U.S. Department of Education designated FLC as a Native American-Serving, Non-Tribal Institutions (NASNTI). FLC is also recognized as a First Generation-Serving Institution by the State of Colorado and an emerging Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI).

==History==
The first Fort Lewis army post was constructed in Pagosa Springs, Colorado, in 1878, and was relocated in 1880 to Hesperus, Colorado, on the southern slopes of the La Plata Mountains. In 1891, Fort Lewis was decommissioned and converted into a federal, off-reservation Indian boarding school.

In 1911, the fort&#x27;s property and buildings in Hesperus were transferred to the state of Colorado to establish an &quot;agricultural and mechanic arts high school.&quot; That deed came with two conditions: that the land would be used for an educational institution, and &quot;to be maintained as an institution of learning to which Indian students will be admitted free of tuition and on an equality with white students&quot; in perpetuity. Both conditions have been the missions and guides for the Fort Lewis school&#x27;s various incarnations over the past century.

The Fort Lewis high school expanded into a two-year college in the 1930s, and in 1948 it became Fort Lewis A&amp;M College, under the State Board of Agriculture&#x27;s control. The &quot;Aggies&quot; studying at the Fort Lewis Branch of the Colorado State College of Agriculture and Mechanics could take courses in agriculture, forestry, engineering, veterinary science, and home economics.

Fort Lewis College began another period of growth and changes in 1956, when the college moved from its longtime home in Hesperus to its present location, east, atop what was then known as Reservoir Hill, overlooking Durango. Here, FLC became a four-year institution, awarding its first baccalaureate degrees in 1964.

Also in 1964, the college dropped the &quot;A&amp;M&quot; moniker, changed its mascot from the Aggies to the Raiders, and changed the school&#x27;s colors from the green and yellow of the Colorado State University system it had been affiliated with to blue and gold. In 1994, the college&#x27;s mascot became the Skyhawks. In 1995, FLC joined the Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges, and in 2002, it became independent of the Colorado State University system and formed its own governing Board of Trustees.

=== Reconciliation efforts ===
In 2019, Fort Lewis College formed the Committee on FLC History to examine its connection to the federal Indian boarding school system. The college has since undertaken initiatives including listening sessions, community engagement, and institutional changes aimed at reconciliation. In partnership with the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, FLC supported legislation investigating the impacts of federal Indian boarding schools in Colorado. The Board of Trustees reaffirmed its commitment to reconciliation in 2023.

==Campus==
The 247-acre Fort Lewis College campus is in southwestern Colorado, 6,872 feet atop a mesa overlooking the Animas River Valley and downtown Durango, Colorado. A network of trails as well as city bus service (free to students with FLC IDs) connects the campus and town.

The campus&#x27;s distinctive architectural theme utilizes locally quarried sandstone to acknowledge the region&#x27;s Native pueblo building style and evoke the Four Corners landscape and colors. The style was crafted by Boulder architect James M. Hunter, whom the college contracted to establish a campus building plan in the late 1950s, after its move from Hesperus to Durango.

Today, on-campus housing is in six residence halls and two apartment buildings, with singles, doubles, and suites. Also on campus are 14 academic buildings, as well as a Student Life Center, Aquatic Center, and Student Union. On-campus athletic facilities include Ray Dennison Memorial Field, Dirks Field, the Softball Complex, Whalen Gymnasium, and the Factory Trails, an off-road bicycling race course.

The new Student Union opened in 2011, and hosts the college&#x27;s cultural centers, the Native American Center and El Centro de Muchos Colores, student government, the Environmental Center, the post office, and the bookstore. The Student Union also offers several dining options, and houses both a Leadership Center and a Media Center that includes the college&#x27;s news magazine, literary journal, and KDUR radio station.

The U.S. Green Building Council awarded the Student Union LEED Gold status for its sustainability features. It is the third LEED Gold building on campus, along with the Berndt Hall Biology Wing and Animas Hall. Those environmental awards helped FLC be named one of &quot;America&#x27;s Coolest Schools&quot; by &quot;Sierra&quot; magazine, the official publication of the Sierra Club, in 2011.

==Academics==
Fort Lewis College is divided into three academic units: the School of Arts &amp; Sciences, the Katz School of Business, and the School of Education. These units collectively offer 60 undergraduate majors, 47 minors, and 23 certificates. The college also provides five graduate programs and four graduate certificates in education. Additionally, Fort Lewis College offers two &quot;3+2&quot; master&#x27;s programs in social work and public history, in partnership with the University of Colorado-Denver and the University of Denver, respectively. 

The institution is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Specific programs are also accredited by relevant professional bodies, including:

* Engineering: ABET
* Chemistry: American Chemical Society
* Katz School of Business: Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, covering degree programs in Accounting, Business Administration, Economics, and Marketing
* Music: National Association of Schools of Music

The college&#x27;s education programs are also approved by the Colorado Department of Education.

==Athletics==

The college&#x27;s athletic teams, the Skyhawks, compete in the NCAA at the Division II level as a member of the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference (RMAC); as well as the Western Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (WILA) for women&#x27;s lacrosse and a nationally ranked cycling program that competes at the Division I level of USA Collegiate Cycling. In 2017, FLC&#x27;s cycling program won its 23rd national championship at the 2017 USA Cycling Collegiate Mountain Bike National Championships in Missoula, Montana.

=== Ray Dennison Memorial Field and foundational use of &quot;student-athlete&quot; ===
Home football games and lacrosse matches are hosted at Ray Dennison Memorial Field, which can accommodate 4,000 - 6,000 spectators. The field was named in honor of Fort Lewis A&amp;M College football player Ray Dennison, a 26-year-old married father of three who died as a result of an on-field collision while playing in a football game vs. Trinidad Junior College in September of 1955. Following his death, his widow filed a claim for death benefits with the Colorado Industrial Commission. The commission approved the claim which was affirmed on appeal by a Colorado district court. However, Fort Lewis College together with the State Compensation Insurance Fund appealed the claim to the Colorado Supreme Court. In 1957, the court ruled that his widow was not entitled to death benefits because football players are &quot;student-athletes&quot; and the employer-employee relationship does not exist. This ruling was foundational to defining the legal relationship between the colleges and their athletes and one of the earliest known uses of the term student-athlete.

<doc id="102946" wikidata="Q48409" url="?curid=102946" title="Flag of Albania">
<text>The flag of Albania () depicts a silhouetted black double-headed eagle in the center of a red background. The red stands for bravery, strength, valour and bloodshed, while the Eagle – traditionally the symbol of Albanians – represents the sovereign state of Albania. The flag was established as the national flag of Albania when the country gained its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912.

==Origin==

During John Hunyadi&#x27;s campaign in Niš in 1443, Skanderbeg and a few hundred Albanians defected from the Turkish ranks; for twenty-five years he scored remarkable victories against the Ottomans. He adopted the similar Eastern Roman imperial flag, with the double-headed eagle and the red background, and his victories brought him the papal title &quot;Athleta Christi&quot;. The eagle was used for heraldic purposes in the Middle Ages by a number of noble families in Albania and became the symbol of the Albanians. The Kastrioti&#x27;s coat of arms, depicting a black double-headed eagle on a red field, became famous when he led a revolt against the Ottoman Empire resulting in the independence of Albania from 1443 to 1479. This was the flag of the League of Lezhë, which was the first unified Albanian state in the Middle Ages and the oldest representative political body in the country with extant records.

The symbol of the double-headed black eagle on a red background was re-used by Albanian nationalists during the 19th and early 20th centuries as a symbol of their campaign for their country&#x27;s independence from the Ottoman Empire. In Ottoman territory, the first time it was raised in possibly over 400 years is the Battle of Deçiq (6 April) in the Albanian revolt of 1911. It was raised by the rebellion leader Ded Gjo Luli on the peak of Bratila (present-day Tuzi Municipality) after victory was secured. The phrase &quot;Tash o vllazën do t’ju takojë të shihni atë që për 450 vjet se ka pa kush&quot; (Now brothers you have earned the right to see that which has been unseen for 450 years) has been attributed to Ded Gjo Luli by later memoirs of those who were present when he raised the flag. It was one of three banners brought to Malësia by Palokë Traboini, student in Austria. The other two banners were used by Ujka of Gruda and Prelë Luca of Triepshi.

The Albanian flag has gone through a number of changes over the years as different regimes have modified it. During the reign of King Zog (r. 1928–1939), a crown was added to the flag and was replaced by two fasces during the Italian occupation of Albania. After World War II, the communist regime added a five-pointed golden star, which was removed on 7 April 1992 after the communist government in Albania collapsed.

Albania&#x27;s maritime flags—the civil ensign and the naval ensign—are both different from the national flag. The civil ensign consists of three horizontal bands of red, black, and red. The naval ensign is similar to the national flag, except that the eagle is on a white field, and the lower portion of the flag has a red stripe. The eagle of the flag of Albania is depicted on the reverse of the Albanian five lekë coin, issued in 1995 and 2000.

Beginning in 1969, the flag of Albania was widely unofficially flown in Kosovo by the country&#x27;s ethnic Albanian population. The flag was the symbol of the self-declared proto-state Republic of Kosova during the 1990s. Kosovo uses a different flag that was designed to avoid any symbols associated with a particular ethnic group, similarly to the flags of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Cyprus.

==National flag==
The national flag of Albania was standardized by Law Nr.8926, dated 22 July 2002 of the constitution and defined in articles II, III and IV.

A summarized translation of the law is written below:
==State flags==

===Flag raised on Independence Day (1912)===
According to researcher and art conservator Frederik Stamati and his colleague Ariola Prifti, an ethnographic fund specialist at the Center for Albanological Studies, there is no trace evidence of the original flag that was raised in Vlorë on 28 November 1912, the day Albania declared its independence. This viewpoint is reaffirmed in an editorial by news media Top Channel dated 1 November 2012 and titled &quot;The mystery of the first Albanian flag&quot;. It concludes that &quot;there is no definitive proof&quot; on how the raised flag looked on the day Albania declared its independence, while providing ten hypotheses. 

A model of the flag often perceived as the original is seen in a 1913 postcard that shows alongside it a photograph of Don Aladro Kastriota in uniform. Eqrem bey Vlora writes in his memoirs, published posthumously as &quot;Lebenserinnerungen&quot;, Munich (1968–1973), that sometime in 1909 while visiting Paris, he had the good fortune to meet Don Aladro, a wealthy spanish-basque diplomat and a strong supporter of the Albanian cause who at one point had announced his candidacy for the Albanian throne by claiming descent from the House of Kastrioti through his paternal grandmother, a noblewoman that lived during the era of Charles III. With his financial means and some propaganda, he made known the Albanian cause for independence in European political circles. During their meeting, Vlora asserts the following episode occurred:


More support is given to this thesis in the testimony of Syrja bey Vlora who in his book of memoirs titled &quot;From the End of Ottoman Rule to the War of Vlora&quot;, writes in page 70 the following: &quot;On 28 November, with the desire and consent of all, it was decided to raise the flag of Albania and declare National Independence. As it was not possible to prepare the flag that day, a flag was taken from our house, which my son Eqrem had been guarding with full respect since 1908(?). It rose amid the cheerful manifestations and cheers of the people.&quot;
Historian Valentina Duka provides further insights into this argument in her book &quot;History of Albania, 1912–2000&quot;, where she publishes authentic documents from the archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From these documents, we learn of the efforts made by the government of Prime Minister Kostaq Kotta, to collect historical objects of this era and to house them at the National History Museum.
In 1930, the minister of foreign affairs Rauf Fico, began a correspondence with Eqrem bey Vlora, who at the time was serving as the ambassador of Albania in Athens. In these communications, Eqrem bey strongly emphasizes that the flag raised on the day of the declaration of independence is indeed the one that was given to him by Aladro Kastriota. He goes on to explain that the flag along with other personal possessions, were confiscated and burned during 1915, by the government of the so called Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus in the home of a family friend in Delvinë. They had been transferred there for safekeeping from the rebel forces of Central Albania that had invaded Vlorë.
Kristo Floqi writes in the weekly newspaper Arbënia in 1936, that &quot;the national flag that was raised for the first time had been &quot;crafted&quot; with her own hands by Marigo Posio from a cloth purchased by a local drapery merchant named Diamanti and based on the model drawn by Dom Mark Vasa and Petro Fotografi&quot;. In a later correspondence that Floqi writes to the editor of Drita Newspaper, dated 17 January 1937 and titled &quot;The designer of the flag that was flown in Vlorë for the declaration of our independence&quot;, in response to Kol Rodhe, the flag is described as &quot;a thin red woven cloth, 3 meters long and 2 meters wide and on which a black double-headed vulture was branded&quot;. Floqi may have had such knowledge of the flag as his brother Thanas was one of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence and Floqi himself was married to Urani Poçi, the sister of Marigo Posio. 
This second hypothesis is also supported by Posio&#x27;s assistant, Thina Ferra who claims the following:
 
Vinçenc Prennushi (O.F.M.) wrote in &quot;Gjeth e Lule&quot; his immortal romance &quot;Grueja Shqyptare&quot; which is thought to have been inspired by Marigo Posio.

===Flag of the Provisional Government (1912–1914)===

The weekly Albanian language newspaper Zër&#x27; i Popullit (), based in New York City, published on the cover page of its 7th issue, dated 17 December 1912, a color illustration of the Albanian flag.
It shows a striking resemblance to another illustration found on the cover page of the 16th issue of the 2nd annual edition of Perlindja e Shqipëniës newspaper, the official publication of the newly formed Albanian State, dated 7 March 1914.

===Flag of the self-proclaimed Republic of Central Albania (1913–1914)===

Recently, while researching the archives of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, scholar Marenglen Kasmi observed a paper envelope which contained a letter signed by Essad Pasha Toptani and addressed by the Austro-Hungarian royal imperial embassy in Berlin to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dated 7 May 1915. In it, a piece of cloth roughly 20 by 30 cm in length, in light red color with a white star polygon at the lower right corner is presented as the &quot;national flag&quot; with Essad Pasha identifying himself as interim president and general supreme commander. What stands out about this flag is its resemblance to the Ottoman flag, where only the crescent has been removed.

===Flag of the Principality of Albania (1915)===

The National History Museum presently has in its archive a total of 15 flags that date as far back as 1880. One of these flags belongs to the period of Prince Wilhelm&#x27;s reign. It was given to the museum as a gift by diplomat Rauf Fico who had found it abandoned in the prince&#x27;s palace some years later. The flag is in a rather poor state making it difficult to restore and digitally reconstruct. A slightly different image of the flag is found in Jaho Brahaj&#x27;s book &quot;Flamuri i Kombit Shqiptar&quot; that shows the flag in a deteriorated form, without the shielded peacock and with a gold star on top. A similar model can be corroborated in Artan Lame&#x27;s book &quot;Princi i Shqiptarëve&quot; that shows a shielded purple-colored peacock and the eagle wingspan in a more compact form with the historically accurate five-pointed white star hovering at the top. A 2012 auction in Genoa, Italy unveiled for the first time the flag of the principality, physically intact, displayed inside a square laminated wooden frame with the descriptive title shown at the bottom in golden letters embossed onto a black coated strip. The flag which was found in Durrës on 20 December 1915, had been taken from there by italian diplomat Baron Carlo Aliotti aboard the Austrian destroyer SMS Lika.

===Flag of the Autonomous Province of Korçë (1916–1920)===

The protocol agreement on the Autonomous Province of Korçë states in Article IX: 
 A transient flag was previously raised from the second floor balcony of the prefecture building by the police prefect Themistokli Gërmenji. Present in the public ceremony were the French commander Henri Descoings and his military personnel. Official surviving flags of this period are currently housed at the Flag Museum in Korçë.

===Flag of the Congress of Lushnjë (1920)===

The flag used at the Congress of Lushnjë was identified for the first time on 25 November 2011 inside the archives of the Ethnographic Fund at the Center for Albanological Studies. 
The flag was in the possession of patriot Veli Vasjari who had carried it inside the building where the proceedings of the congress were held. In 1928, it was donated to the National History Museum and it has been a part of its ethnographic fund ever since.

===Flag of the Albanian Republic (1925–1928)===

State symbols during the period of the Republic were always shown in square form. This was preponderant with the national flag, state emblem, presidential insignia and even symbols used in commerce. The flag of the republic is seen for the first time in Teki Selenica&#x27;s encyclopedic guide book Shqipria më 1927, e illustruar, page 124.

===Flag of the Albanian Kingdom (1928–1939)===
Article III of the Fundamental Statute of the Albanian Kingdom describes the flag as red with a black two-headed eagle in the center. A variant of this flag is on display at the Mezuraj Museum. The square-shaped flag, currently in the possession of the Royal Family, was produced in the latter period of King Zog&#x27;s reign and can be seen in an archived film footage being replaced by fascist officers during the unveiling ceremony of the new fascist flag, on 4 December 1939.

===Flag of the Kingdom of Albania (1939–1943)===

The Yearbook of the Kingdom of Albania in its 1940–XVIII edition, describes in Title I, Article II of the Constitutional Charter the following:

 Images of the flag used during this time are available at the Istituto Luce archive. The flag is displayed at different public events, from the inauguration of a local school by prime minister Shefqet Vërlaci to the opening session of the Albanian Fascist Party congress which was held at the Palace of the Superior Fascist Corporative Council.

===Flag of Albania under Nazi Germany (1943–1944)===

In October 1943 the union with Italy was officially dissolved and the country reverted to the decrees of September 1928. The pre-Italian flags and symbols were used during this period.

=== Flag of the Democratic Government of Albania (1944–1946) ===

The flag used by the Democratic Government of Albania, which was the first ruling government following the war of liberation, was published for the first time in the War Bulletin of National Liberation (), issue nr.51 dated 28 November 1944. The usage of this specific flag is widely seen in public events and military court sessions. It has also been confirmed in the 1980 publication by the Marxist-Leninist Studies Institute titled &quot;Epopeja e Luftës Antifashiste Nacionalçlirimtare e Popullit Shqiptar 1939–1944&quot;. Prior to this, a transient flag of a different contour with moderately outstretched wings was used at the Congress of Përmet and subsequently at the first Anti-Fascist Youth Congress (BRASH).

===Flag of the People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania===

A golden star was added to the national flag on 10 January 1946.

Law nr.5506, dated 28 December 1976 of the constitution of the People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania in Chapter III, Article I, Title CVIII describes the flag as follows:

The flag symbols were designed by painter Sadik Kaceli.
On 7 April 1992, the Assembly formed after the early elections, in the afternoon session voted to remove the communist emblem as the official symbol of the state, the removal of the golden star from the flag and initiated a parliamentary commission tasked with studying the proposals of a new emblem of the state.

==Presidential flag==

The symbols of the presidency, which include the flag, the emblem and the &quot;Mother Teresa&quot; Decoration, were approved by a presidential decree dated 10 July 2014 by President Bujar Nishani. The presidential flag is described as follows:

&quot;The predominant colors are the colors of the national flag (red background and black eagle) and the golden color has been added which symbolizes strength, prosperity and endurance. The decorative symbols of the flag are the black eagle taken from the coat of arms of the House of Kastrioti, accepting it as one of the most ancient symbols used by the Albanian leader, the (golden) Skanderbeg helmet positioned in a straight frontal stance, symbolizing impartiality and determination in representing national unity, as well as oak (golden) leaves which represent longevity, strength and dignity, also taken as a symbol from antiquity used by King Gentius of the Illyrians. The use of the crown-shaped oak branches is also seen as a plinth which holds the other elements in place. Dimensions are specified as 140cm x 100 cm.&quot;

<text>Jane Therese Curtin (born September 6, 1947) is an American actress and comedian. 

First coming to prominence as an original cast member on the hit TV comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1975, she went on to win back-to-back Emmy Awards for Best Lead Actress in a Comedy Series on the 1980s sitcom &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot; portraying the role of Allison &quot;Allie&quot; Lowell. Curtin later starred in the hit series &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot; (1996–2001), playing the role of Dr. Mary Albright.

Curtin has also appeared in many movie roles, including Charlene in &quot;The Librarian&quot; series of movies (2004–2008). She reprised one of her &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; characters, Prymaat (Clorhone) Conehead, in the 1993 film &quot;Coneheads&quot;. She is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Queen of Deadpan&quot;. &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; once called her a &quot;refreshing drop of acid&quot;. She was included on a 1986 list of the &quot;Top Prime Time Actors and Actresses of All Time&quot;.

== Early life ==
Jane Therese Curtin was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, one of four children born to Mary Constance (née Farrell) and John Joseph Curtin, who owned an insurance agency. Her maternal ancestry is Irish, and her paternal, Curtin, ancestry is also Irish, originally from Newmarket-on-Fergus, County Clare. Curtin has one younger brother, Larry Curtin, who lives in South Florida; and an older brother, John J. &quot;Jack&quot; Curtin ( 2008). Her younger sister, Virginia (Ginny), died in 2001. Curtin is a cousin of actress and writer Valerie Curtin. Her uncle was the radio personality Joseph Curtin.

She was raised Roman Catholic, and grew up in Wellesley, Massachusetts. She graduated from Newton Country Day School of the Sacred Heart in Newton in 1965. Curtin earned an associate degree from Elizabeth Seton Junior College in New York City, class of 1967. She then attended Northeastern University from 1967 to 1968 before dropping out of college to pursue a career in comedy.

== Career ==
She has served as a U.S. Committee National Ambassador for UNICEF. In 1968, Curtin decided to pursue comedy as a career and dropped out of college. She joined a comedy group, The Proposition, and performed with them until 1972. She starred in &quot;Pretzels&quot;, an off-Broadway play written by Curtin, John Forster, Judith Kahan, and Fred Grandy, in 1974.

=== &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; ===
One of the original Not Ready For Prime Time Players of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (1975), Curtin remained on the show through the 1979–1980 season. Guest host Eric Idle said that Curtin was &quot;very much a &#x27;Let&#x27;s come in, let&#x27;s know our lines, let&#x27;s do it properly, and go&#x27; ... She was very sensible, very focused&quot;, and disliked the drug culture in which many of the cast participated. Show writer Al Franken stated that she &quot;was so steady. Had a really strong moral center, and as such was disgusted by much of the show and the people around it&quot;.

On the show, and mirroring her own low-key real life, she frequently played straight-woman characters, often as a to John Belushi and Gilda Radner. Curtin anchored &quot;SNL&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment from 1976 to 1977, paired with Dan Aykroyd from 1977 to 1978 and Bill Murray from 1978 to 1980. On occasional &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segments, her newscaster character served as a foil to Belushi, who often gave a rambling and out-of-control &quot;commentary&quot; on events of the day. During these sketches, she timidly tried to get Belushi to come to the point, which would only make him angrier. Curtin&#x27;s newscaster also introduced baseball expert Chico Escuela (Garrett Morris), a heavily accented Dominican, who started his sketches by saying, &quot;Thank you, &quot;Hane&quot;&quot;, before repeating his famous catchphrase, &quot;Baseball been bery, bery good to me!&quot; She also introduced Roseanne Roseannadanna (Radner) and would listen in exasperated silence at Roseannadanna&#x27;s disjointed commentary before ultimately cutting her off. In addition, she sang in the &quot;Chevy&#x27;s Girls&quot; sketch in season two, episode two, alongside Laraine Newman and Radner, and sang again with Newman and Radner as a trio backing up Morris as he sang the song Three Little Words for the cold opening of the Season 4 premier episode.

In a parody of the &quot;Point-Counterpoint&quot; segment of the news program &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Curtin delivered a controlled liberal viewpoint (à la Shana Alexander) vs. Aykroyd, who (in the manner of James J. Kilpatrick) epitomized the right-wing view, albeit with an over-the-top &quot;attack&quot; journalist slant. Curtin presented the liberal &quot;Point&quot; portion first. Then Aykroyd presented the &quot;Counterpoint&quot; portion, sometimes beginning with the statement, &quot;Jane, you ignorant ,&quot; to which she replied, &quot;Dan, you pompous ass.&quot; The recurring segment has been discussed in an article on &quot;How to Respectfully Disagree&quot; in &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;.

Curtin is also well known for her role in the Conehead sketches as Prymaat (wife/mother of the Conehead family), and as Enid Loopner (in sketches with Radner and Murray). She is one of many cast members who appear in the retrospective compilation DVD &quot;The Women of SNL&quot; (2010, 97 minutes).

=== Later television work ===
Unlike many of her fellow &quot;SNL&quot; cast members who ventured successfully into film, Curtin chose to stay mainly in television, with a few sporadic film appearances. To date, she has starred in two long-running television sitcoms. First, in &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot; (1984–89), with Susan Saint James, she played a single mother named &quot;Allie Lowell&quot; and twice won the Emmy Award for Best Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.

Following &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot;, Curtin co-starred on the 1990 sitcom &quot;Working It Out&quot; with Stephen Collins. The series was created by Bill Persky, a writer, director, and producer of &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot;, but it was not successful and was cancelled after 13 episodes. Later, she was part of the cast of &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot; (1996–2001) playing a human, Dr. Mary Albright, opposite the alien family composed of John Lithgow, Kristen Johnston, French Stewart, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. As with &quot;SNL&quot;, her mostly strait-laced character was often confounded by the zany and whimsical antics of the Solomon family.

In 1997, Curtin narrated two episodes of the documentary television series &quot;Understanding&quot;, and she has done voice work for &quot;Recess&quot; and &quot;Cyberchase&quot;. She guest starred on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 1985.

Curtin also starred with Fred Savage in the ABC sitcom &quot;Crumbs&quot;, which debuted in January 2006 and was cancelled in May of that year. She also guest-starred on &quot;Gary Unmarried&quot; as Connie, Allison&#x27;s mother. In 2012, she joined &quot;Unforgettable&quot; as Dr. Joanne Webster, a gifted but crusty medical examiner; in 2014, she occasionally reprised her role as the first Guardian on &quot;The Librarians&quot;. In 2020, she had a co-starring role as a quirky mother-in-law on the ABC sitcom &quot;United We Fall&quot;.

=== Film ===
In 1980, Curtin starred with Susan Saint James and Jessica Lange in the moderate hit &quot;How to Beat the High Cost of Living&quot;. In 1993, Curtin and Dan Aykroyd were reunited in &quot;Coneheads&quot;, a full-length motion picture based on their popular &quot;SNL&quot; characters. They also appeared together as the voices of a pair of wasps in the film &quot;Antz.&quot; In 2009, she played Paul Rudd and Andy Samberg&#x27;s mother in &quot;I Love You, Man&quot;. In 2013, she took a small role in &quot;The Heat&quot; as Mrs. Mullins, the mother of Detective Mullins. Curtin played Moira, the Headmistress of the Motherland, in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Godmothered&quot;.

=== Other work ===
Curtin has also performed on Broadway on occasion. She first appeared on the Great White Way as Miss Proserpine Garnett in the play &quot;Candida&quot; in 1981. She later went on to be a replacement actress in two other plays, &quot;Love Letters&quot; and &quot;Noises Off&quot;, and was in the 2002 revival of &quot;Our Town&quot;, which received huge press attention as Paul Newman returned to the Broadway stage after several decades away.

She also has narrated several audio books, including Carl Hiaasen&#x27;s novel &quot;Nature Girl&quot;.

On May 7, 2010, Curtin placed second in the &quot;Jeopardy! Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational&quot;, winning $250,000 for the U.S. Fund for UNICEF. Michael McKean won the tournament, while Cheech Marin came in third.

She presented Emmy Awards in 1984, 1987, and 1998; the 11th Annual American Comedy Awards in 1997; and the 54th Annual Golden Globe Awards in 1997.

Curtin has guest hosted several episodes of &quot;Selected Shorts&quot; produced by Symphony Space and distributed by Public Radio International.

==Personal life==
She married television producer Patrick Francis Lynch on April 2, 1975; they have one daughter, Tess Curtin Lynch, born in 1983. They live in Sharon, Connecticut.

<doc id="102948" wikidata="Q616765" url="?curid=102948" title="Inline skates">
<text>Inline skates are boots with wheels arranged in a single line from front to back, allowing a skater to roll along on these wheels. Inline skates are technically a type of roller skate, but most people associate the term roller skates with quad skates, another type of roller skate with a two-by-two wheel arrangement similar to a car. Quad skates were popularized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Inline skates became prominent in the late 1980s with the rise of Rollerblade, Inc., and peaked in the late 1990s. The registered trademark &quot;Rollerblade&quot; has since become a generic trademark due to its popularity. To this day, &quot;rollerblades&quot; continues to be used in everyday language to refer to inline skates.

In the 21st century, inline skates come in many varieties, suitable for different types of inline skating activities and sports such as recreational skating, urban skating, roller hockey, street hockey, speed skating, slalom skating, aggressive skating, vert skating, and artistic inline skating. Inline skaters can be found at traditional roller rinks, street hockey rinks, skateparks, and on urban streets. In cities around the world, skaters organize urban group skates. Paris Friday Night Fever Skate (Randonnée du Vendredi Soir) is renowned for its large crowd size, as well as its iconic +10 mile urban routes. Wednesday Night Skate NYC is its equivalent in New York City, also run by volunteers, albeit smaller in size.

==History==

===Development of wheeled skates===

The history of inline skates traces back to the origin of ice skates in prehistoric times, with runners made from animal bones. Steel blades eventually replaced bone runners in the 13th century, with the Dutch sharpening blade edges for better purchase on ice for propulsion. Since then, enterprising inventors have attempted to make boots that could similarly glide on non-ice surfaces, with wheels.

In 1760, John Joseph Merlin, a renowned clock-maker, musical-instrument maker and inventor from Belgium, experimented in London with &quot;skaites&quot; that &quot;ran on wheels&quot;. These were the first recorded wheeled skates. Written records left no drawings or descriptions of wheel configurations, however.

In 1819, Charles-Louis Petibled from France filed the first known patent on wheeled skates. Three wheels in a single line, mimicking a steel blade, were integrated into a wooden foot stand with leather straps. Two wheels sat under the ball of the foot, while one wheel was positioned under the heel. A copy of Petibled&#x27;s wheeled skates is on display at the National Museum of Roller Skating, in Lincoln, Nebraska, USA.

In 1823, Robert John Tyers from London was granted a patent for his skates with five wheels in a single line, again mimicking a steel blade. The main body of the skate is called the stock (or foot stand), and is meant to be attached to the bottom of a shoe. A frame with two wheel-mounting sides is secured to the stock. This skate employs a large wheel in the middle, and progressively smaller ones towards the front and the rear, creating a rockered wheel setup that allows skaters to execute turns more easily.

This novelty skate was popularized in London as &quot;Volito&quot; (to fly about, in Latin). A hand-colored print from 1829 in the British Museum depicts a satirical scene where men wearing Volito skates escape chase by men on boots. The National Museum of American History has a Volito skate in its collections. 

Robert Tyers was not the only inventor inspired by Petibled to make their own wheeled skates. Many inventors followed suit in the wake of the Petibled skate, including Spence, Lohner and Legrand. Yet another inventor was the famous ice skater Jean Garcin. He filed his own skate patent in 1828, named the Cingar skate, an anagram of his name. This skate, however, was technically similar to Petibled&#x27;s patent. As a result, Petibled was able to render null and void Garcin&#x27;s patent in 1832.

Up to this point in history, &quot;roller skates&quot; as a term was not yet used. Inventors simply referred to their contraptions as wheeled alternatives to ice skates. All known novelty skates had wheels aligned in a single line. Skates were simply assumed to have a single runner, whether a steel blade on an ice skate, or a row of wheels on a wheeled skate. This state of affairs continued through 1860.

===Development of roller skates===

Around 1860, wheeled skates started to become more popular. Patents on a wide variety of wheeled skates were issued. The configuration of wheels started to depart from previous single-line arrangements. Many of these early patents were titled &quot;roller-skate&quot; or &quot;parlor skate&quot;. Indeed, the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; dates the earliest printed use of the noun &quot;roller skate&quot; to 1860. Then, starting in 1870, the popularity of roller skates skyrocketed. Within a decade the term &quot;roller skates&quot; entered the popular lexicon.

In 1860, the US Patent Office granted Reuben Shaler the first US patent on roller skates, titled &quot;Wheel-Skate&quot;, with an accompanying drawing labeled &quot;Parlor Skate&quot;. The four rollers (wheels) formed a straight line, and were mounted by pins on two side pieces of a hanger that we would now recognize as a frame of a modern-day inline skate. His key innovation was a flexible rubber ring he mounted on each of the four metal roller cores. This allowed his roller skates to gain better purchase on carpeted floors.

In 1861, Albert Anderson was granted a US patent on &quot;Improvement in roller-skates&quot;. The accompanying drawings titled &quot;Parlor Skate&quot; showed a two-wheeled skate, with a small wheel under the heel, and a much larger wheel in front of the toes, reminiscent of penny-farthing bikes. The large front wheel overcomes oncoming obstacles, preventing a skater from falling forward. The stock (or foot stand) is inclined forward, with a raised heel section.
 This is not dissimilar to how some modern-day hockey, freestyle and speed skates pitch a player leaning forward by default, giving a skater greater stability and stronger strokes.

In 1861, Henry Pennie was granted a US patent titled &quot;Roller-skate&quot;. Its drawing, titled &quot;Parlor Skate&quot; showed a stock supported by two rows of wheels, with 4 wheels on each row, totaling 8 wheels per skate. In the patent specification, Pennie explained that his key innovation was the two rows of wheels. This set his skates apart from all previous roller skates that attempted to emulate ice skates with a single, centered runner. Pennie reasoned that two rows of wheels provided increased support area for better balance, without materially incurring greater friction. Beginners would learn with two rows of wheels, for a more balanced footing. Skillful skaters would move the two rows of wheels increasingly closer to each other, using different widths of washers as spacers, until they graduated to a single row of wheels. Pennie&#x27;s skate, too, had two side plates secured to the stock, forming what continues to be known as a &quot;frame&quot; today.

In 1863, James Plimpton patented an &quot;improvement in skates&quot; consisting of a stock with four wheels arranged in a two-by-two configuration like a wagon. This was not the first roller skate with two rows of skates, but it was the first double-row skate that could be easily turned by a beginner. Plimpton&#x27;s key innovation was a mechanism that allowed a skater to turn a skate by simply leaning towards the desired direction. The mechanism converted rocking and canting motions of the skate platform (stock) into movements of the two wheel axles. These axles in turn steered all four wheel into the right orientations for the turn.

Plimpton opened roller skating rinks and aggressively promoted this new sport of roller skating. His wheel-steering invention, together with his business acumen, spread his roller skates far and wide, resulting in a &quot;rinkomania&quot; in the 1860s and 1870s. The editors of the 1876 series of &quot;Historical Notes on Roller Skates&quot; (published in The Engineer) marveled at the number of roller skate patents that resulted from the rinkomania. They compiled a table of roller skate patents issued in Europe and America from 1819 through 1876, showing an exponential growth starting with Plimpton&#x27;s 1863 invention. Plimpton&#x27;s skates forever changed the meaning of &quot;roller skates&quot;. For the next century, the term &quot;roller skates&quot; no longer referred to all wheeled skates. It became synonymous with the two-by-two Plimpton-style skates, particularly to the masses.

===Adoption of ball bearings===

Skates became more practical with the adoption of ball bearings in the wheel assembly. This directly followed the development of precision ball bearings in the 1850s, and the application of ball bearings in bicycles by Albert Louis Thirion in 1862 in England. Ball bearings reduced bearing friction to as little as 10% of former values, greatly improving top speeds of bicycle racers in Europe.

In 1852, Joseph Gidman filed a provisional patent application titled &quot;A skate&quot;, where he described a skate with a front wheel, a rear wheel, and two side wheels mounted mid-section. Instead of constructing a wheel with a solid nave, Gidman inserted rollers between a wheel and its axle, effectively applying roller bearings to skate wheels. But Gidman was ahead of his time. He spent 30 years trying to get roller skates with roller bearings mass produced, with little success.

In 1876, William Bown&#x27;s provisional patent application was allowed, titled &quot;Improvements in the construction of wheels or rollers for roller skates and for other purposes&quot;. Bown placed a felt ring, lubricated with oil, between a wheel and its axle to attempt to reduce friction. But this wasn&#x27;t substantially more effective, and required constant oil refills.

In 1877, Joseph Henry Hughes&#x27; provisional patent application was allowed, titled &quot;Improvements in the bearings of bicycles and velocipedes or carriages&quot;. Hughes, a local of Birmingham, described a ball bearing race for bicycle and carriage wheels which allowed for initial adjustment of the system to ensure optimal contact between components, and for subsequent adjustments to compensate for component wear from use. As a successful owner of Bown Manufacturing Company, William Bown persuaded Hughes to sell rights to this patent to him, and to join him on further bearing innovations for the next decade. This led to the successful Aeolus brand of ball bearings, used in the first ball-race-pedals and wheel bearings for bicycles and carriage wheels. Similar ball bearings were subsequently adopted for use on roller skates.

In 1884, two US patents claiming the use of ball bearings in roller skates were issued one after the other. George Burton filed on August 17, 1883, and was granted a patent on November 11, 1884. Levant Marvin Richardson filed on August 6, 1884, and was granted a patent on December 9, 1884. Richardson was more successful in marketing his invention, eventually starting and growing Richardson Ball-Bearing Skate Company to make these skates.

Skates equipped with ball bearings further fueled the Plimpton 2x2 skate craze. Skate manufacturers operated rinks to promote roller skating during the boom period from 1880s through 1910s. Skates made for rink use were referred to as parlor skates or club skates. By 1910, Richardson Roller Skate Company competed with mainstream brands including Henley Roller Skates, Winslow&#x27;s Skates, Baltimore Skate MFG Co, and Chicago Roller Skate Company.

===Further development of inline skates===

Plimpton&#x27;s two-by-two roller skates took the limelight starting in 1863 and held it for more than a century. But inventors and enterprises continued to bring new roller skates with a single line of wheels to the market, under Plimpton&#x27;s shadow. For instance, in 1873, Peck &amp; Snyder advertised &quot;parlor or floor skates&quot; with 4 rubber wheels in a single line. These skates had not yet incorporated ball bearings. They closely resembled skates advertised in 1861, which were based on Reuben Shaler&#x27;s 1860 patent.

Early roller skaters were preoccupied with avoiding rolling backward. E. Edwards and H. Koerner patented heel brakes in 1893 that prevented a single-line roller skate from rolling backward. To brake, a rubber ball was jammed against a rear wheel covered with rubber tire. This skate did not claim its straps, ankle support, or two-wheel configuration, as those preexisted.

Many single-line roller skates during this period had two wheels. In 1895, the Pneumatic Road Skate Company in London took out a full-page advertisement in the book &quot;Figure and Fancy Skating&quot;, showing a road skate with two wheels, each covered in hollow rubber tires modeled after bicycle tires. This skate closely resembled the skate shown in the Edwards/Koerner patent. Both provided similar ankle support that was popular at the time. These single-line skates were purported to allow easy turning of skates, without needing the rocking and canting mechanism from Plimpton&#x27;s roller skates. They were advertised as &quot;road&quot; skates with ball bearings, and were hyped as having great military utilities for moving troops. The company performed a public demonstration before its public offering.

Across the Atlantic Ocean in America in 1904, Peck &amp; Snyder Sporting Goods, which was acquired by A.G. Spalding &amp; Brothers, advertised Racing Roller Skates with two wheels, each mounted with tempered steel ball bearings and supported by a rubber tire. These closely resembled the Pneumatic Road Skates design. However, the American versions replaced the ankle support with a strap, now known as the 45° strap in modern inline skates. Many companies produced similar road skates in this period, often called &quot;automobile cycle skates&quot;, after the pneumatic tires. For instance, John Jay Young was granted patents for steel-tired wheels as early as 1872. However, by 1905 he was selling skates with pneumatic wheels instead. The Cycle Skate and Sporting Goods Company also sold these skates in 1906.

Another popular two-wheeled skate set the foot stand below the centers of wheels. This required that the wheels be placed in front of and behind the foot stand. In 1893, the first patent describing this design configuration was granted to A. Sherrif and R. Anderson. In 1899, Augustus Nichols Lindsley was issued the first patent for a telescopic stock for this type of skate, to accommodate different foot sizes. The design employed T-shaped tubing for the telescopic connections. In 1903, Benjamin S Peard filed a patent application on a wheel hub with spokes and fillets to reduce weight while still providing rigidity and strength. The Peard wheel was particularly suited for this skate design.

By 1906, Cycle Skate and Sporting Goods Co. began selling road skates that combined features from Sherif/Anderson (low foot stand), Lindsley (adjustable stock), and Peard (wheels with hub and spokes). In 1912, John Jay Young followed suit and began selling similar skates. These were marketed as &quot;Automobile Road Skates&quot; in 1913 and beyond.

===Precursors to modern inline skates===

From the 1910s to the 1970s, many more variations of single-line wheeled skates were patented and manufactured. While still in the shadow of 2x2 roller skates, some of these started to gain popularity amongst ice hockey players, by the 1960s and 1970s, due to their better emulation of ice blades.

In 1925, the US patent office granted Chomin Harry of Canada a patent for a skate frame that gave each wheel axle dual purposes: 1) interlocking with the inner race of double ball bearings, as an axle, and 2) being threaded into one sidewall of the wheel frame, as a bolt. This enabled easy wheel replacement, and allowed an ice blade to be attached in place of the wheels.

In 1938, Christian Siffert secured a patent on a roller skate frame resembling 21st century inline skates, complete with a heel brake. The frame accommodated 3 wheels. This odd selection of wheel numbers was intentional and led to the patented claim. It allowed the frame to be economically cut from a single sheet of metal, where portions of sidewalls were repurposed into parts of toe and heel plates, leaving voids seen on sidewalls. This was one of the very few pre-Rollerblade frames where two sidewalls of a frame were permanently connected. The resulting single-piece frame was lighter, stronger and cheaper than previous designs. This skate was produced and sold by Siffert himself initially in 1941, by Best Ever Built Skate Co. (BEB) thereafter, and later as &quot;Jet Skate&quot; by AFCO Products Inc. in 1948.

In 1966, Gordon K Ware, one of the Ware brothers who founded the successful Chicago Roller Skate Company, obtained a patent for a skate with multiple frame segments that overlapped. In this design, wheel axles served a second purpose - that of securing overlapping segments through specific axle holes. This allowed the frame to adjust to various shoes and sizes. In addition, the front wheel and the rear wheel could be placed higher than the middle two, to create various rockered wheel setups for better turning. Wheels were mounted on double ball bearings. This skate could be customized for different needs from different sports, including figure skating, speed skating, and ice hockey.

The inspiration for this Chicago skate came from off-season training skates used by Russian speed skating teams in the 1960s. Barbara Lockhart of the US Olympic speed skating team brought a pair back to the US. Montgomery Ward commissioned 25,000 pairs of these, and advertised them in 1965 catalogs as excellent off-ice training tools for figure skating and ice hockey. The skate was sold under the name &quot;Roller-Blade&quot;, coined by Joe Shevelson of the Chicago Roller Skate Co. Ladies&#x27; version came with high-cut leather shoes, and men&#x27;s version medium-cut leather shoes. Montgomery Ward couldn&#x27;t sell the inventory, so the skate was soon discontinued. 

Up to this time, almost all roller skates were of the &quot;clamp-on&quot; variety - they were strapped to a skater&#x27;s own shoes or boots. In his patent application, Ware instead described his skate as explicitly designed to be permanently riveted to any shoes a user desired to use. This borrowed from the ice hockey industry which, by 1908, routinely riveted ice blades to hockey boots, resulting in improved stability and performance for skaters.

In 1975, Morris (Maury) Silver received a patent on a &quot;Tandem Roller Hockey Skate&quot;. The key claim of this patent was the single-unit nature of the skate, where a wheel frame was permanently attached to a hockey boot. Prior patents on roller skates did not claim a boot as part of the apparatus. In this patent, the boot was part of the &quot;roller hockey skate&quot;. This skate was equipped with larger wheels than those in prior designs. The front wheel was positioned farther forward, and the rear wheel farther back, for enhanced speed and balance, as required for hockey. Both front and rear wheels can be shifted upward in their slotted mounting holes for a rockered wheel setup. The patent and drawings specified the use of roller bearings, when ball bearings had become commonplace by this time.

Silver developed his skate with his friend, Ralph Backstrom, a Canadian hockey player from the Montreal Canadiens. Backstrom briefly played for the Los Angeles Kings from 1970 to 1973, and would train off-season with this skate. Their company marketed the skate under the label Super Sport Skate (or Super Street Skate), as an off-ice training tool for ice hockey players.

Meanwhile, another roller sport, skateboarding, became popular in the 1960s. Avid ocean surfers adopted skateboards with rubber wheels during downtimes. In the 1970s, the increasingly popular sport of skateboarding reached new heights with the advent of polyurethane wheels and their superior performance. Some of these polyurethane skateboard wheels were in fact made by the Chicago Roller Skating Co. 

At the same time, in the 1960s, the ski boot manufacturer Lange launched the first molded plastic ski boots furnished with liners. Lange then entered the ice hockey market in the 1970s with similar plastic hard boots, gaining some success. These boots were rigid to provide proper support for aggressive hockey skating. Yet they featured soft inner liners to provide a comfortably fit, despite the use of hard shells. A pivoting cuff is riveted to the boot, allowing a player to forward flex. 

Both polyurethane wheels and plastic hard boots would soon be borrowed for modern inline skating, to be combined with the best ideas from precursor skates, leading to the rise of Rollerblade in the 80s and its wide adoption by the general population.

===Development of modern inline skates===

For two centuries, inventors and entrepreneurs attempted to popularize skates with a single row of wheels. By the end of the 1970s, only Chicago Roller-Blade and Super Sport Skate managed to gain limited adoption for training, within a niche community of ice hockey players. It took Scott Olson, his brothers, his friends, and his company, Rollerblade, to perfect these skates, and to make them enjoyable as mainstream recreation for the general population.

In 1979, Scott Olson, an ice hockey player, stumbled upon the Super Sport Skate (or Super Street Skate). Fascinated by these novelty skates, he soon made a living promoting and selling them to hockey players in Minneapolis. As a licensed distributor, Olson traveled on these skates through the city and around the state in guerrilla marketing tours to promote the product. Scott Olson and his brother Brennan tinkered with these skates. They removed the wheel frames from Super Street Skate, and custom-fitted them to customers&#x27; old hockey skates for improved ankle support. Wearing plastic Lange boots thus retrofitted, Scott and his friend Mark Lipson skated for 200 miles from Minneapolis to Grand Rapids, MN, in a five-day marketing campaign.

Through tinkering, prototyping and road testing everywhere he could, Scott Olson eventually arrived at a design with an adjustable/expandable frame, polyurethane wheels and double ball bearings. The skate rolled faster, and remained more reliable on road surfaces. But a patent search turned up the Chicago Roller-Blade, which claimed many of his design features. In 1981, Olson persuaded the Chicago Roller Skate Company to give him the patent, in exchange for a percentage of the profit. 

In 1981, Scott Olson created a company called Ole&#x27;s Innovative Sports, and made manufacturing arrangements. Soon, he marketed his own &quot;Ultimate Street Skates&quot; (or Ultimate Hockey Skates), a skate of his own design attached to a hard boot with thick liners similar to the plastic Lange boots. By then, skateboards had adopted polyurethane wheels made by roller skate manufacturers, with standard ISO 608 ball bearings. Scott similarly adopted these roller skate wheels, shaving tens of thousands to fit them to his Ultimate skates. These skates came with a toe brake and had the now-familiar Rollerblade logo imprinted on them, which Scott and his friend designed.

In 1982, Scott Olson started to market his skates as a proper sport in itself, venturing out of the initial niche where they served as an off-season training tool for ice hockey. Scott organized Minnesota hockey players to fly east to play roller hockey teams in New York City, with his team skating on Ultimate Street Skates, and the NYC teams on traditional 2x2 skates. Scott also started to advertise his skates to the masses, in print and in person, as everyday fun activities, where one could &quot;roll over large sidewalk craters without feeling them&quot;. Enthusiasts colloquially referred to these skates as &quot;roller blades&quot;.

In 1983, Scott Olson marketed a new generation of skates with heel brakes instead of toe brakes, under the trademark &quot;Rollerblade&quot;. His company grew from one worker in 1980 to 25 employees in 1985, selling many thousands of units that year. In the same year, the company published a book, &quot;Rollerblades: Dryland Training for Ice Hockey&quot;, edited by Chris Middlebrook, with chapters written by Randy Gregg, Jack Blatherwick, Laura Stamm, Brad Buetow, Scott Olson, and Brennan Olson. This is the first book that elaborated on the equivalency of inline and ice hockey skates with respect to hockey moves, and the first book that documented wheel rockering adjustments, wheel wear, and wheel rotations.

Around 1986, Ole&#x27;s Innovative Sports was renamed &quot;North American Sports Training Corporation&quot; (NASTC). As the Rollerblade brand became more popular, the company was eventually renamed to Rollerblade Inc. around 1988.

In 1988, the company released &quot;Lightning&quot; skates with fiberglass-reinforced plastic frames. The Lightning TRS (Team Rollerblade series) with a cuff buckle was particularly successful, and turned &quot;Rollerblade&quot; into a household name. The company claimed to have up to 75% of the estimated $12 million market in 1988.

The Chicago Roller-Blade patent expired at the end of 1983. Eying the success of Rollerblade, competitors jumped into the race. Another Minneapolis firm, First Team Sports Inc., started manufacturing its Ultra Wheels skates in 1986. More manufacturers joined in, including Oxygen, K2 and Bauer. Then, the Super Sport Skate patent expired in 1992. This allowed even more inline manufacturers to produce skates without fear of infringement.

Rollerblade continued to dominate the market in the 1990s, in the face of competition. In 1990, it had 66% of the estimated $50 million global inline market. Sales peaked in 1996, leaving 1997 with a reported revenue of $106 million, or nearly 40% of the estimated market. According to Rollerblade, by 1997, 20 percent of American households had a pair of inline skates, and a 1998 survey found that 32 million Americans over the age of six had tried inline skates at least once that year.

Modern inline skates became practical for manufacturers to mass-produce, and enjoyable for the masses as a recreational sport, when technological advances such as polyurethane wheels, standard ISO ball bearings, and molded plastic boots arrived on the scene. These skates incorporate double ball bearings with dual-purpose axles from Chomin Harry (1925), single-piece frames from Christian Siffert (1938), adjustable wheel rockering from Gordon Ware (1966), single-unit boot/frame, longer frames and larger wheels from Maury Silver (1975), plus additional innovations.

Both Scott and Brennan continued to refine skates, each having been granted a dozen patent applications for skate-related innovations from 1982 through 1996.

=== Rollerblade as a noun ===

From 1979 through 1990, when referring to his skates in patent applications, Scott Olson called his skates simply &quot;roller skates&quot;, &quot;street skates&quot; or &quot;hockey skates&quot;. &quot;Rollerblade&quot;, as a trademark, was filed on July 25, 1984 with the USPTO, with a first use date of March 1983. But when promoting them in the early 1980s, &quot;Rollerblade&quot; was often used as a noun for this new type of skate, exclusively sold by Ole&#x27;s Innovative Sports. For instance, the 1985 book edited by Chris Middlebrook and published by the company, was titled &quot;Rollerblades: Dryland Training for Ice Hockey&quot;, with a plural &quot;Rollerblades&quot;. The Oxford English Dictionary dates the earliest printed uses of &quot;Rollerblade&quot; to the publication of the trademark in 1985 by the USPTO Gazette, and to this 1985 book.

By the late 1980s, Rollerblade, as a company, started to relabel roller skating of this style as &quot;in-line&quot;, in order to preempt &quot;rollerblading&quot; from becoming a new verb. This was reflected in Brennan Olson&#x27;s 1987 patent, which he titled &quot;In-line roller skate with frame&quot;.

By 1990, newspapers and the media had generally adopted &quot;in-line skating&quot; as the name of this new recreational sport. In 1991, Rollerblade Inc. used &quot;in-line&quot; in the subtitle of its official guidebook &quot;Wheel Excitement&quot;: &quot;Official Rollerblade® Guide to In-Line Skating&quot;. In the same year, &quot;Rollerblade In-Line Skate Association&quot; (RISA) was founded, but quickly changed its name to the International Inline Skating Association (IISA) shortly after. 

When comparing modern inline skates to the 2x2 Plimpton roller skates, enthusiasts referred to the latter as &quot;quad skates&quot;. But the term &quot;quad skates&quot; never took hold among the masses.

== Anatomy and function ==

All modern inline skates share a common basic blueprint. A skate comprises a boot, worn on the foot. To the bottom of the boot is attached a frame, the most rigid part of the skate. The frame holds a number of wheels in place with wheel axles. In between a wheel and an axle are two bearings. Bearings allow a wheel to rotate freely around its axle. Finally, a rubber brake typically attaches to the frame of the right boot, on recreational skates.

For many skaters, the frame is never removed or replaced. But wheels are consumables, as they wear down with use, and require periodic mounting rotations and even replacements. Inline skates usually come with a skate tool for wheel, bearing and frame maintenance. The tool will have a hex wrench or a Torx wrench for removing wheel axles from a frame, and wherever applicable, for removing bearings from a wheel, and for removing a frame from a boot.


In the 1980s and 1990s, all inline skates had hard boots, borrowed from ski boot designs. A removable liner in a hard boot provides a snug yet comfortable fit between a skater&#x27;s foot and the hard shell. Around 1996, K2 introduced soft boots with an exoskeleton. These provide the most comfortable fit, at the expense of reduced rigidity. In the 2010s, hybrid (soft) boots with an endoskeleton were introduced to the high-end market. A hybrid boot has an integrated, non-removable liner. This is glued to a rigid endoskeleton shell integrated with the sole, providing direct power transfer from the foot to the wheels.

All three types are able to secure a foot in them without slack, with proper closure systems. Soft boots are often laced, and hard shells are usually secured with buckles. Velcro straps are also common in all types of boots. Well-designed boots provide proper heel support and ankle support to a skater.

The length of a frame positively affects stability and negatively affects turning agility. Longer frames accommodate more wheels, and taller frames larger wheels; both positively affect top skating speed. Modern inline skates are equipped with polyurethane wheels. Harder wheels are suitable for smooth indoor surfaces, while softer wheels are more comfortable for rough outdoor surfaces. Beginners skate with all wheels touching the ground, for enhanced stability, known as a &quot;flat&quot; wheel setup. Advanced skaters may choose to configure wheels in a &quot;rockered&quot; setup for enhanced maneuverability. The weight of a skate is an important consideration for some disciplines. Lighter boots, frames, and wheels are preferred. However, weight reduction is only achieved with escalating costs and diminishing returns.

=== Heel support ===

Heel support refers to the ability of a boot to keep a skater&#x27;s heel comfortably seated and firmly locked down in the heel pocket of the boot, even during aggressive maneuvering.

A heel pocket is formed by the shell, inner liner and sole of a boot. A properly-designed boot has a heel pocket that hugs the heel, with an anatomical contour. A proper closure system causes the &quot;facing&quot; (where eyelet tabs are) to push the instep against the heel pocket, preventing the foot from shifting or lifting during maneuvers. As a result, the heel remains in contact with the footbed at all times.

Proper heel lock serves as a stable foundation for the entire foot. It allows a skater to adopt an athletic stance for skating by flexing the lower leg forward, without raising the heel. A snug fit means reduced movement of the foot within the skate, and thus reduced opportunity for friction to cause blisters. At the same time, the whole skate becomes transfixed to the foot as an extension of it, allowing efficient strides with a faithful transfer of power from the foot to the ground.

=== Ankle support ===

Ankle support refers to the ability of a boot to prevent sideways movement of a skater&#x27;s ankle and lower leg, while allowing the shin to flex forward into an athletic stance. In some skates, such as recreational and aggressive skates, this is achieved via a hinged cuff. In other skates, such as hockey skates, this is enabled by rigid, and anatomically-shaped quarter panels that lock both ankle bones in place, from two sides, leaving the shin to freely pivot forward.

Proper ankle support allows a skater to keep a skate upright as a straight extension of their entire leg, when observed from the front. Without rigid support on both sides of the ankle, the foot may wobble within the boot, causing the skate to tilt inward or outward. This creates pronation, making it harder for a skater to glide on a single skate at best, and resulting in sprains and other injuries at worst.

A properly-designed boot does not hinder the mobility of the ankle joint, allowing a skater to pivot the lower leg (the shin) forward, adopting a squatting (athletic) stance. This forward flex (or forward leaning) is known as dorsiflexion of the foot. It places the center of body mass atop the ball of the foot, a balancing skill crucial to most skating moves. Without such a squatting stance, the leg and the skate form a 90° angle, placing the entire body weight of a skater on the rear wheel of the skate. This is dangerous for a beginner because a small backward shift of the upper body will cause a skater to pivot their entire body on the rear wheel, and thus fall uncontrollably backward.

== Types ==

There are a variety of ways to design and make modern inline skates. Different types of inline skates reflect needs specific to different inline skating disciplines, such as recreational skating, urban skating, roller hockey, street hockey, speed skating, slalom skating, aggressive skating, and artistic inline skating.

However, skates are not equivalent to disciplines. Often a particular type of skate can be used in several disciplines, with varying degrees of efficiency and comfort. For instance, when specifically-designed skates are not available for freestyle slalom skating, a skater could use recreational skates, aggressive skates, hockey skates, or even speed skates. But some of these alternatives are more suitable for slalom skating than others. Hockey skates, in particular, most closely meet the needs of slalom skating, due to the shared requirement for rigorous turning and edging maneuvers in both roller hockey and slalom skating.

In some cases, a skate launches a whole new discipline. For instance, the Rollerblade Lightning TRS has been widely credited for enabling aggressive inline skating as a sport, with its durable boot and nylon-reinforced frame, suitable for skaters to perform grinds on street obstacles.

Disciplines and skates continue to evolve over time. In 1985, Roller Zetra wheels were advertised as much faster than the Pro-line wheels. But by 1988, 64mm Rollerblade Zetra 100 and BladeRunner wheels had become the slower wheels, compared to faster, larger, and higher-end Lightning wheels, now at 70mm in diameter. Around 1999, a normal wheel size for recreational skates was 70-72mm, and large wheels for speed skates meant 78-82mm. By 2024, the standard wheel size for recreational skates had increased to 80-84mm, and large wheels for speed skates ranged from 90mm to 125mm.

For simplicity in advertising, manufacturers and resellers generally classify inline skates based on disciplines. Some types named this way are significantly distinct from one another, with their own unmistakable features. For instance, &quot;aggressive skates&quot; have signature soul plates and H-blocks (or grooves), for grinding on urban street and skatepark obstacles. &quot;Speed skates&quot; have low-cuff boots with long frames and large wheels, for gaining absolute top speed. &quot;Hockey skates&quot; have reinforced quarter panels instead of hinged cuffs, for better ankle support.

Some disciplines are not large enough to warrant their own classification. Thus, dissimilar disciplines with similar equipment needs are grouped under a single skate category. For instance, freestyle skating, slalom skating, wizard skating, city commuting, and urban skating may be crammed into a single &quot;urban skates&quot; category.

Then, there are the rest of skaters who casually skate, skate for fitness, or skate for cross-training. These purposes constitute 90% of actual inline skate sales. Skates suitable for these activities are often grouped together as &quot;recreational skates&quot;. Some makers instead call them &quot;fitness skates&quot;. Others split them into two or more categories: recreational, fitness, and cross-training. Usually, the fitness and cross-training categories reflect increasing cost and thus quality of skates.

=== Recreational skates ===

Recreational skates constitute 90% of the inline skate market. The label recreational encompasses not only casual recreational uses but also fitness skating, which involves more frequent skating over longer distances, and requires more robust and efficient skates. Often the recreational skates category also caters to cross-training needs, with even hardier boots and frames, plus a wider range of options for wheels, among other features. Boundaries between these disciplines are blurry, with manufacturers and resellers marketing their skates in inconsistent ways.

This category can be better understood as &quot;unspecialized&quot; inline skates, or generic skates. All other types of skates can be thought of as specialized deviations from this basic type. Recreational skates usually come with four wheels of average size, and a frame of average length, which is just slightly longer than the boot. This places the front wheel halfway ahead of the toe box, and the rear wheel halfway behind the heel pocket, a design that remained unchanged since Scott Olson&#x27;s adoption of Super Sport Skate from 1979.

Recreational skates are the default type of skates that a beginner finds comfortable and stable to skate on. The cheapest skates fall under this category. They are not necessarily of lower quality; they are simply mass-produced. As a beginner progresses, more expensive recreational skates are available with the same unspecialized characteristics, but now upgraded with more durable materials and hardware, possibly providing improved heel support, ankle support, and an enhanced skating experience. For instance, soft boots with an exoskeleton are usually the least expensive. Hard boots with removable liners are often priced higher. Hybrid boots with an endoskeleton are high-end models. Often, the higher-end models are marketed as fitness skates or as cross-training skates.

Recreational skates are equipped with heel brakes. These allow beginners to learn to stop rolling, with a simple pivot of a foot on its heel. Heel brakes can usually be removed once a skater learns to stop rolling without them, using a skating move such as the T-stop.

Casual skaters and fitness skaters can be seen rolling alongside a creek, a lake, or a park on paved bike paths. Some also take to the streets, skating on bike lanes and paved roads.

=== Aggressive skates ===

Aggressive skates are the most specialized inline skates, in contrast to recreational skates. They are designed for one specific purpose only: grinds. Grinding is the art of sliding on street obstacles such as stairs, rails, benches, curbs, ramps and walls. To support a skater performing these stunts, aggressive skates are built with strong hard boots based on ski boots, as Olson originally did with his Ultimate Street Skates. These are bolted to thick frames which are fitted with the smallest wheels in all of inline skating. The smaller wheels bring the boot closer to the ground, making tricks and grinds easier to perform. To help a skater lock onto an obstacle of interest during a grind, an aggressive skate provides channels and surfaces such as H-blocks, frame grooves, backslide grooves, grind plates, soulplates, etc. Transitioning between these stunts, a skater often jumps considerable heights, or rides down a long flight of stairs (known as stair bashing). Thus, aggressive boots are often fitted with shock absorbers to dampen shocks upon landing.

Aggressive skates co-evolved with the discipline which started as inline stunts. It then turned into streetstyle skating, and finally into aggressive inline skating.

Soon after the Rollerblade Lightning TRS was released in 1988, skaters experimented with extreme stunts on inline skates. Many took the axle wrench that came with Lightning TRS, and bolted it onto the frame as a makeshift grind plate. In the early days, frame grooves were formed on frames by the continuous grinding of frames on street obstacles. Inline skating books published on or before 1995 treated the discipline as stunt skating or street-style skating, following nomenclature from skateboarding. The word &quot;street&quot; in street-style meant that skaters performed tricks on and over street obstacles.

In 1993, the movie Airborne came out, showcasing streetstyle inline skating to an entire country. In 1994, the video &quot;The Hoax: An Inline Crime&quot; was released by T-Bone Films, featuring icons such as Chris Edwards, Arlo Eisenberg, Chris Mitchell, Jess Dyrenforth, Pat Parnell, and others. Both videos inspired a new generation of young aggressive skaters. While skaters were still custom-modding their skates for aggressive skating, the Aggressive Skaters Association (ASA) was formed in 1994. Shortly after, ESPN X Games adopted aggressive inline skating in 1995 and ran aggressive competitions for 10 years, cementing the discipline.

Over time, aggressive skates evolved to incorporate even more mods by skaters. The frame walls were thickened to provide rigidity, and to allow skates to be inclined further during grinds, without incurring wheel bites. Frame grooves became a standard, and H-blocks were integrated. The two middle wheels were spaced farther apart, creating a larger split between these two wheels, to enhance grinding experiences. 

In 1996, Roces M12 (Majestic 12) was launched, with small wheels, a boot closer to the ground, a large gap between two middle wheels, and an H-block. Soon, the M12 became synonymous with aggressive skates. In 1997, makers such as USD introduced integrated soulplates (also soul plates, from sole plates), providing a platform for soul grinds using the bottom of the boot, rather than the frame. Backslide grooves were eventually introduced, to allow even greater skate inclination during grinds. By 2003, the soulplate became a single-piece, flat platform in Roces M12, with an even wider boot bottom to further enhance soul grinding. From then on, inline skating books dedicated entire chapters to aggressive skates and skating.

In 2001, aggressive skate manufacturers standardized on UFS (Universal Frame System), the first replaceable mounting standard for inline skates. Most UFS frames accommodate small wheels up to 60mm. Some aggressive frames with frame grooves and H-blocks are designed with thick walls to prevent wheel bites. These frames can be used with a flat wheel setup, where all wheels touch the ground. Other frames without prevention measures against wheel bites can be set up with an anti-rocker wheel configuration. The second and third wheels are replaced with even smaller &quot;grindwheels&quot; (or &quot;antirockers&quot;) made of hard plastic that are resistant to wheel bites. Some skaters go one step further, eliminating the two inner wheels altogether. Instead of wheels, &quot;juice blocks&quot; are installed to keep the structural integrity of the frame walls.

Aggressive skates come with no brakes. It is assumed that skaters are able to stop without brakes, as they grind on street obstacles (termed street skating), perform stunts at skateparks (termed park skating), and take to the air at the top of ramps (termed vert skating). Brakes only hinder aggressive maneuvers.

The name &quot;aggressive&quot; has been controversial outside the core community of aggressive skaters. Even within the core community, debates continue to this day on alternative naming. Many in the community call aggressive skating rollerblading (or simply blading), and thus members bladers. Others call it aggro. Some skate manufacturers eschew the label &quot;aggressive&quot;, choosing to market their aggressive skates instead as street skates or park skates. For instance, Rollerblade Inc. called this discipline &quot;extreme skating&quot; in its 1991 official guidebook, &quot;Wheel Excitement&quot;. Even after the aggressive competitions from X Games in 1995, Rollerblade Inc. continued to call it &quot;extreme skating&quot;, in its 2000 book: &quot;Superguides: Inline Skating&quot;. The company marketed these skates as &quot;Street Skates&quot; all these years, to this day, almost 30 years after the X Games.

=== Hockey skates ===

In the 21st century, skates for inline hockey (roller hockey) use a construction process for the boot that differs significantly from other inline skates. They are mainly made by ice hockey manufacturers such as CCM, Bauer (Mission), True, Marsblade, etc. In many instances the same boots are fitted with a blade holder for ice hockey, and an inline frame for roller hockey. As a consequence, inline hockey skates continue to use the same rivet-based mounting system from ice hockey. This is unlike other inline skates which have largely moved on, now adopting standard mounting systems such as UFS, 165mm, 195mm and Trinity, with replaceable frames for all but entry-level skates.

Hockey frames, wheel choices, and wheel setups reflect the specific needs of the game. Hockey skates adopt some of the shortest frames in all inline skates, to allow a player to turn hard on a dime, and to do crossovers unhindered. Hockey boots are kept as low to the ground as possible, only allowing their frames to accommodate smallish wheels, in order to deliver the best stability for hard edging maneuvers. The largest wheels used are 80mm which would be the smallest ones found in recreational skates. Wheels with a rounder profile are preferred, to support sharp edging and turning, without the skate sliding out from under a player.

Hockey skates often incorporate a hi-lo wheel setup through the deliberate use of wheels with different diameters (e.g. 80-78-76-74mm), or by having its frame explicitly support such setup (typically 80-80-76-76mm). A hi-lo setup places larger wheels at the rear, and smaller wheels in front, while all wheels touch the ground. This raises the heel higher, and pushes the toe cap lower, thus the name hi-lo. It causes a player to forward flex naturally, for greater stability and stronger strokes. 

Inline skates started as a wheeled equivalent of ice hockey skates, when Olson adopted molded plastic hockey boots that Lange just introduced to the ice hockey world. This type of hard boot construction, with a pivoting cuff and a removable liner, as typified by the 1988 Rollerblade Lightning, evolved into many types of inline skates over four decades. Yet ironically, neither ice hockey nor roller hockey ended up adopting hard-shell boots nor hinged cuffs.

The rigor of a hockey game requires that inline hockey skates be made as lightweight as economically possible. At the same time, these skates must deliver superior heel support and ankle support. In addition, power transfer from foot to wheels needs to be direct and instantaneous. Traditional inline hockey skates achieve these by creating an unyielding wall, with anatomical contours that hug the heel and both sides of the ankle. This wall is known as a quarter package comprising left and right quarter panels, and it is bolted to a rigid outsole platform. The wall and its connection to the outsole is reinforced, often with an injection-molded thermoplastic piece sewed into the wall, and then nailed, tacked or glued to the outsole.

The rest of the boot is built around the quarter package, with a thick tongue to support the shin for an aggressive athletic stance, along with an reinforced toe cap. The entire boot is thus designed to protect a foot from flying pucks. The boot is furnished with an integrated and non-removable liner with varied thickness at places, to further deliver an anatomical fit. Hockey skates use eyelets and laces, not buckles or straps. Players often use waxed laces which stay unyielding around eyelets, to selectively tighten certain eyelets and loosen others, based on needs. Usually the toe area is laced comfortably, the middle eyelets are laced tight for proper heel lock, and the upper eyelets loose for ankle mobility (forward flex).

Thus, traditional hockey boots are not hard boots with removable liners. They are not soft boots with an exoskeleton. Traditional hockey boots may be constructed in a fashion similar to hybrid soft boots, but they are not soft anywhere, and eschew hinged cuffs for contoured quarter panels. Hockey boots are in a class of its own.

=== Speed skates ===

Speed skates (or race skates) are purpose-built inline skates with a single goal: speed. To this end, speed skates need to enable a racer to generate the most efficient strides and to glide with the least amount of friction. The distance for a race ranges from a few hundred meters to 100 kilometers. And a race may take place indoors on tracks, or outdoors on paved roads. World records for outdoor races exceed 27 miles per hour. For instance, Joey Mantia holds the world record for the outdoor 10-kilometers race from 2009, at 13 minutes and 46.801 seconds.

Speed skating differs from other inline disciplines in that a speed skater tilts her body trunk forward for up to 60° when racing, positioning her head far ahead of the skates in order to reduce her body profile with respect to air resistance. A speed skater bends her knees aggressively for up to 80° in a deep-seated squatting position, much more than other disciplines. Such body configuration requires a deep forward leaning of the shin (dorsiflexion) for proper balance. This deep squatting posture produces the most powerful push-offs, with the farthest displacement of the pushing skate.

Because of the need for a deep dorsiflexion, speed skates have no eyelets, buckles, or straps above middle eyelets at 45° angle which is the minimum requirement for proper heel lock. Indeed, speed skates have no shafts and cuffs commonly found in other inline skates. In order for racers to freely flex their foot around ankle bones, speed boots are cut the lowest among all inline skates, around or below the ankle bones.

A skater compensates for the lack of lateral ankle support from boots by strengthening muscle support for proper ankle movements such as dorsiflexion, pronation and supination, which are essential for double push strides with aggressive push-offs and precise transitions from outside to inside edges. The removal of shaft and cuff significantly reduces a boot&#x27;s weight, a key advantage to a skater in a game where a saving of fractional seconds makes a difference.

A speed skate boot is close-fitting, without much padding, and usually made of leather, carbon fiber, or other strong and lightweight composite materials. For best performance, the boot must conform closely to the shape of the foot to prevent it from moving inside the boot. Thus, most boots are custom-fitted or else heat-moldable.

The frame may be made of aircraft-quality aluminum, magnesium, or possibly lightweight carbon fiber. All frames flex during skating. A stiff frame flexes very little, so it transmits power from the foot to the wheels more directly. A shorter frame navigates tight curves at smaller tracks better but may become wobbly at high speeds. A longer frame provides stable tracking at high speed and increased power transfer, useful for long-distance events.

The length and height of a frame determine the number and size of wheels it can accommodate. More wheels and bigger wheels increase mass, making acceleration harder and slower. But once rolling at speed, a skater can more easily maintain top speed given the rotational inertia. In the 1990s, speed skaters preferred a frame with five wheels, usually 80mm in diameter. In the 21st century, wheel size ranges from 90mm to 125mm. A setup with four 110mm wheels is typical for competitive speed skating, and three 125mm wheels for marathon skates at marathon events.

Speed skates generally adopt either the 165mm or the 195mm mounting standard for securing a frame to a boot. Short speed frames for short track racing use the 165mm standard, while long frames for marathon use the 195mm standard in order to better accommodate larger wheels. Both of these 2-point mounting standards feature a built-in heel lift that pitches a skater forward, creating forward flex.

Speed skating generally adopts harder wheels than other disciplines. Harder wheels minimize energy lost to elastic hysteresis when a skater&#x27;s weight deforms wheels upon ground contact. Speed skaters prefer wheels with high rebound, which returns the compression energy back to the skater. Speed wheels have a pointy bullet profile that reduces friction from drags, when a skate glides and its wheels touch the road upright. The elliptical profile, however, affords greater contact surface for improved traction and control, when a skate is inclined on an edge during push-offs.

Speed skaters pay close attention to the quality of ball bearings and their periodic maintenance. High-quality bearings with precision ratings are the minimum requirement. Regular cleaning and lubrication of these bearings remove trapped dirt and restore them to their optimal performance, which is essential in the pursuit of ultimate speed.

=== Urban skates ===

Urban skate is an umbrella term created by the industry to describe a type of skate suitable for several niche inline disciplines: freestyle skating, slalom skating, wizard skating, city commuting, and urban skating. These activities take place on relatively flat ground, but the surface may not always be paved or smooth.

Freestyle skating is named after its counterpart in skateboarding, just like aggressive street, park, and vert skating are named after street, park, and vert skateboarding, respectively. Freestyle skating is the art of performing skating tricks on relatively flat ground, free of obstacles. Freestyle slalom skating is a form of freestyle skating where tricks are performed around slalom cones. This is standardized by the International Freestyle Skaters Association (IFSA) and World Skate as freestyle slalom to distinguish it from speed slalom, which is a form of speed skating around cones on flat ground. Freestyle skating requires skates that support rigorous turning and edging maneuvers, with characteristics similar to hockey skates. A rockered setup with 76-80mm wheels on a relatively short frame is common for freestyle skating.

Urban skating and city commuting take the activity to the street. But the term &#x27;street skating&#x27; is already taken as a subdiscipline of aggressive skating, for grinding on street obstacles. Thus, this niche market is variously promoted as skating on paved roads or commuting to work on skates. These activities demand longer frames and larger wheels for higher cruising speed, stable tracking, and more comfortable rides on uneven surfaces, similar to speed skates for marathon events. Common wheel setups include 4x80mm, 4x90mm, 4x100mm, 3x100mm, 3x110mm, and 3x125mm.

In terms of skate construction, urban skates overlap with the high-end segment of recreational skates. A hard shell is standard for urban skates. Higher-end models feature hybrid boots with carbon composite shells (endoskeleton) that are heat-moldable. Despite sharing some design goals with hockey skates and speed skates, urban skates are not built like them. Unlike speed skates, urban skates provide strong ankle support with traditional hinged cuffs. Unlike hockey boots, urban boots are not built around a quarter package, nor do they have frames riveted onto them.

Indeed, most urban skate boots support either the 165mm two-point or the Trinity three-point mounting standards, allowing a skater to mount a variety of compatible frames to a boot that best fits them. The same boot can thus be customized with a short frame and average-sized wheels for slalom skating, or with a long frame and large wheels for long-distance road skating.

Both the 165mm and Trinity standards have their heel mounting platforms raised higher than their toe mounting platforms. This difference in height between the raised heel and the lowered toe is known in the shoe industry as a heel-to-toe drop. Such a drop causes a skater to lean forward by default, simulating a slight forward flex. This is similar to the purpose of the hi-lo wheel setup in hockey skates.

Wizard skating is named after the company Wizard Skating, founded by Leon Basin in 2014. Leon and his aggressive inline friends from @Mushroomblading popularized this new form of skating. Leon himself performed flowing footwork from freestyle, slalom, and figure skating while blazing through roads, rolling over curbs, skating up ramps, bashing down stairs, and parkouring on walls. Leon perfected a type of &quot;Wizard&quot; skate for this sport, featuring a long frame, large wheels, and a rockered wheel setup. For a skate size of EU43, these Wizard skates are available with either a 4x100mm or a 5x80mm setup.

Wizard frames utilize the UFS mounting system from aggressive skates. Wizard frames are thus not compatible with other urban boots where 165mm and Trinity mounting systems dominate. Unlike the flat aggressive frames from which UFS originated, a Wizard frame does include a built-in heel-to-toe drop, similar to 165mm and Trinity systems.

== Boots ==

=== Hard boots ===

Hard boots dominated the inline skate market in the 1980s and 1990s at the inception of modern inline skating. They are made of plastic, fiberglass, carbon fiber, or other solid materials. A removable liner in a hard boot provides a snug yet comfortable fit between a skater&#x27;s foot and the hard shell.

Hard boots use a combination of velcro straps and plastic buckles as closures. Some also use laces for the facing of the boot, while others have a front strap (or buckle) instead of or in addition to laces. The front lace and top buckle secure the foot inside the boot. To achieve proper heel lock, the liner is shaped to fit the heel, and the 45° strap (or buckle) presses the instep of the foot against the contour of the liner.

Hard boots have a high cuff (or shaft) to provide proper ankle support. In order to accommodate dorsiflexion, the cuff is made to pivot near the ankle bones. As a skater leans their shin forward, the hinged cuff rotates to follow the lower leg while continuing to provide lateral ankle support.

Molds used in plastic injection molding are expensive to make. As a result, plastic hard boots are usually available only in so-called &quot;dual sizes&quot;. One hard shell is made for two US and EU shoe sizes (e.g. US 9-10, and EU 42-43). A thicker liner is provided for US 9 and EU 42 to fill the gaps, while a thinner liner is provided for US 10 and EU 43. Some manufacturers offer &quot;dual fit&quot; liners, where the same liner can accommodate two shoe sizes using elastic parts, memory foam, and other compressible space-filling materials.

=== Soft boots ===

K2 introduced soft boots to inline skating in 1993 with its Exotech line of recreational skates, marking the company’s entry into the sport. Building on this innovation, K2 later released the legendary K2 Fatty, an aggressive skate featuring the same soft-boot design. Since then, similar soft boots have come to dominate the recreational skate market.

They are akin to hiking shoes, made of textiles, mesh, neoprene, and other soft materials. Liners are integrated into the soft boot, and are thus not removable or replaceable. A soft boot is reinforced in strategic areas with a plastic exoskeleton for structural support.

A soft boot uses a pivoting cuff to support the lower leg, like hard boots. Otherwise, its exoskeleton covers only a small area of the foot. This allows the boot to provide superior airflow through its fabric for moisture extraction, to keep the foot cool.

Soft boots use closure systems similar to those of hard boots. These include laces, velcro straps, and buckles. These include laces, velcro straps and buckles. Lacing the front of the boot is key to securing the foot within the boot, due to the lack of exoskeleton support in this area. On the other hand, the flexible front of the boot readily accommodates different shapes of foot. Soft boots thus provide a more comfortable fit at the expense of reduced rigidity and support, making them suitable for beginners and casual skaters. Committed enthusiasts, however, generally avoid soft boots due to their lack of direct and immediate response to skating moves, which is caused by elastic hysteresis.

Soft boots are lighter and generally less expensive than hard boots. They are easier to make for specific shoe sizes, compared to hard boots. Unlike hard boots, which usually come in dual sizes, soft boots are available in half sizes for US shoe sizes (e.g., US 9.5, 10 and 10.5), and even for some EU shoe sizes (e.g., EU 39.5, 40 and 40.5).

=== Hybrid boots ===

Hybrid boots, also known as hybrid soft boots, look superficially similar to soft boots, complete with soft materials covering a large part of the boot. Unlike soft boots, however, hybrid boots have no exoskeleton reinforcement apart from the pivoting cuff. These boots have an endoskeleton instead, in the form of a composite shell. The shell serves as the sole of the boot, with shell walls extending upward from the sole. The soft upper part of the boot is pulled taut over the shell and glued onto it.

Hybrid boots are lighter than hard boots and soft boots. Yet they remain rigid where the foot meets the boot. Integrated liners in hybrid boots can be made thinner than removable liners in hard boots. In higher-end hybrid boots, the integrated liner is heat-moldable for the best custom fit, and the shell is made of carbon fiber. A hybrid shell sits much closer to the foot than a hard shell or the exoskeleton of a soft boot. As a result, hybrid boots provide more direct and responsive power transfer from a foot to wheels.

Hybrid boots trace their origin to carbon shell development in speed skates of the 1990s and 2000s. Powerslide is a manufacturer offering hybrid inline skates in the 2020s, including Hardcore Evo, Tau, and Swell. However, the label &quot;hybrid&quot; is not yet universally embraced. These boots are often marketed as high-end soft boots.

=== One-piece carbon boots ===

One-piece carbon boots were developed for speed skating in the 1990s. These are boots built around a carbon fiber-reinforced composite shell, where the shell almost completely surrounds a foot. After eyelet holes are punched out of a shell, the shell is usable as a functional boot if laced.

In the 21st century, hockey skate makers began to experiment with composite shells inspired by these advances in speed skates. For instance, in 2004, Easton Sports filed for a patent on an &quot;unitary shell&quot; made from fiber-reinforced resin, with sections of integrated walls arising from the sole. Easton&#x27;s Synergy 1300C came out in 2005, with a unitary shell made with carbon and aramid fibers. This is widely recognized as the first retail hockey skate with a composite shell.A rigid shell exacerbates inherent conflicts arising from key design goals for a hockey skate: being lightweight, economical, a firm support structure comprising an outsole and a quarter package, and lastly, fitting this support to the different foot shapes of individual players. The fitting issue can be mitigated by adding a layer of heat-moldable materials to the quarter package, such that a player can finish the final molding process of a boot at a skate shop or at home. Heat molding became possible in 2006, with the Easton Synergy 1500C.

Other hockey makers take it one step further, creating a single, unbroken composite shell that also incorporates the &quot;facing&quot; portion where eyelets are located. These one-piece monocoque shells are almost usable by themselves as functional skate boots, if laced and mounted with inline frames. With the advent of &quot;one-piece&quot; shells, the traditional hockey boot construction is now known as employing a two-piece shell, comprising a quarter package attached to an outsole. A heat-moldable monocoque shell requires no breaking-in, unlike traditional hockey skates. All tuning needs are done by baking skates in an oven before wearing them, as often as needed.

The use of monocoque shell in hockey skates traces back to Scott Van Horne who started to make and sell custom composite speed skates in the 1990s. He incorporated VH Footwear in 1999, and made custom speed skates in the 2010s. Van Horne worked with Dave Cruikshank to file hockey skate patents in 2009 and 2011, on a composite shell and removable tongue / tendon guard. This shell foreshadowed that used in inline skates with a hybrid soft boot in the 2020s, and became the basis for the retail MLX Skate released in 2010 by Cruikshank&#x27;s new company. Easton Sports bought MLX in 2011, and worked with Cruikshank to release a new Easton Mako skate in 2013, based on the MLX Skate. Easton was later acquired by Chartwell Investments which subsequently sold it to Bauer.

By then, Van Horne had gone back to perfecting custom speed skate boots. In 2012, he created tooling and a process to 3D-scan a skater&#x27;s foot, and to 3D-print a custom last based on which a speed skate boot is shaped. By 2015, VH Footwear had adopted the same tooling and process for hockey skates, filed a patent application, and marketed them under the brand VH Hockey. True Temper Sports bought VH Hockey in 2016, and started to mass produce retail hokey skates with heat-moldable monocoque shells, as well as scaling up 3D scanning of feet at retail stores for custom True hockey skates, leading to inline hockey skates such as the TF9 Roller Skate, and the TF Pro Custom Roller Skate in 2020.

== Frames ==

An inline frame is also known as the chassis in some disciplines, notably hockey. A frame interfaces with the ground via wheels mounted on it, and with the foot through the boot. A rigid frame does not suffer from elastic hysteresis, and is essential for an efficient transfer of power from a skater&#x27;s foot to the ground. For this reason, even entry-level inline skates now use fiberglass-reinforced plastic, instead or softer but cheaper plastic to make frames. For a stiffer yet lightweight frame, aircraft-grade aluminum alloys such as the 6000 and 7000 series are used. Hockey and speed skating often call for magnesium frames, which are even stiffer and lighter than aluminum. Some speed skaters use carbon fiber frames that are the most rigid and lightweight frames available.

=== Frame materials and rigidity ===

In general, stiffer frames require more expensive materials and manufacturing processes. The cheapest options are plastic frames, which are injection-molded with PVC, polypropylene, polyurethane or nylon. These are soft and flexible, thus not suitable outside of low-end skates. Fiberglass-reinforced plastic is more rigid, and is widely used in recreational frames.

Metal frames are produced from aluminum, magnesium and titanium alloys using a variety of processes. Folding a metal sheet is the cheapest option, resulting in a frame less rigid compared to other processes. Die casting is a step up from folding, but the resulting frame is more brittle. Extrusion followed by finishing milling is much more expensive, but produces a very rigid frame. The most expensive option is to run computer-controlled milling (CNC) on a block of metal, called a billet, and carve a frame out of the block.

Rigidity of a frame is an important factor in choosing one. However, other considerations, including cost and weight, also influence the decision. Sometimes, a discipline&#x27;s needs trump many of these factors. For instance, aggressive skaters exclusively use fiberglass-reinforced plastic frames for their superior performance and consistent friction when grinding against all types of surfaces. Some of the most rigid frames, such as those made of carbon fiber, can be too brittle for hockey. These frames shatter rather than deform under impact or extreme stress due to their low fracture toughness. In addition, some skaters value comfort, which is at odds with rigid frames; increased rigidity transmits all imperfections of the road surface to the skater unattenuated, reducing comfort.

=== Rockerable frames ===

Wheel rockering can be achieved by using wheels of different diameters, or by using a frame with built-in support for a rockered arrangement of identical wheels. Modern inline skates of the 1980s came standard with oblong mounting holes as a standard feature on their frames. These holes allowed skaters to configure their skates with the same wheels in either a flat setup for long-distance skating, or a banana-rockered setup for highly maneuverable disciplines like hockey, with sharp turns and quick footwork.

Skate manufacturers subsequently devised various toggleable hardware for quick and reliable switching of wheel setups. These involved the use of frame spacers, axle guides, mounting hole inserts, or axle bolts that fit oblong mounting holes in two or more ways, in order to shift the axle’s center to a preset position.

With the advent of mounting standards and easily-swappable frames in the 21st century, some inline frames now eschew toggleable hardware in pursuit of reduction in complexity, weight, and number of components. Each brand specifies exact locations for mounting holes to create a wheel assembly profile that it deems optimal. For instance, the Endless 90 Trinity frame presents a flat setup when configured with three 110mm wheels, and a slightly banana-rockered setup with four 90mm wheels. Wizard frames have a similar fixed setup that mimics an even milder banana rocker. Wizard frames are, in general, even longer than Endless frames. Therefore, even though both shift the two middle mounting holes by similar amounts (1mm to 2mm), the rockered profile on Endless is further attenuated.

=== Non-standard frames ===

Modern inline skates started as off-season training tools for ice skaters. Many early inline frames were designed to be length-adjustable, so that each skater could have inline skates tailored to their individual shoe size. For instance, inline skates made for the USSR speed skating team in the 1960s accommodated differences in shoe sizes by using a variable length connector between the front and rear mounting platforms, and by allowing wheels to be mounted at different locations on the frame. This tradition continued and was further expanded in the 1966 Chicago Roller-Blade and in Rollerblade skates from the early 1980s.

There were no standards for boots, frames, or the way frames were mounted onto boots. The 1962 USSR skate and the 1966 Chicago Roller-Blade were designed to be mounted onto a flat sole, or an equivalent dress shoe with a front sole level with the heel. On the other hand, the 1975 Super Sport Skate was modeled after ice hockey skates, and had a frame with a raised heel mount, resulting in a built-in heel-to-toe drop (or heel lift).

These early inline skates featured frames that were riveted to the boots, mirroring the construction method used in ice skate manufacturing. The lack of standards and the fixed-mounting process made it hard to mix and match boots and frames. For instance, early 1981 prototypes of the Ultimate Hockey Skate by Scott Olson had a flat Chicago frame mounted onto an ice hockey boot. This required that an artificial heel disc be inserted in between the frame and the boot to make up for the heel lift designed into the hockey boot.

Non-standard inline frames still dominate the entry-level market. Many such frames are not replaceable. Most cannot be adjusted to compensate for a skater&#x27;s ankle pronation or supination. Some beginner skates, such as the Powerslide One Zoom in 2024, continue to use riveted frames. These skates are fixed at the factory, and cannot be further customized.

Outside of the entry-level market, inline skates have largely consolidated around a few mounting standards. Aggressive skates and Wizard skates follow the UFS standard. Speed skates exclusively use the 195mm two-point standard. The rest generally adopt the 165mm two-point standard. The Trinity standard with three mounting holes was created in 2016. It has been gaining popularity in urban skating, where skaters wish to mount bigger wheels with a minimal increase in frame height.

Only one type of inline skate does not follow any of these standards: the hockey skates. Inline hockey skates continue to use the same riveted mounting process as their ice hockey counterparts. All hockey skates, from inexpensive to high-end custom-molded ones, have proprietary frames that cannot be replaced or adjusted.

=== 165mm and 195mm frames ===

In 1974, Inze Bont, founder of the speed skate manufacturer Bont, created fiberglass-reinforced boots for short track racing, featuring 2 mounting holes spaced 165mm apart. An adjustable ice blade was attached to the boot using these holes. As inline skating gained popularity in the mid-1980s, companies like Darkstar, Mogema, and Raps began producing inline frames designed to mount onto these short track boots. This led to the establishment of the first inline skate mounting standard.

The 165mm mounting standard incorporates a height differential of approximately 10mm between the front and rear mounting points. This creates a heel lift (or heel-to-toe drop), allowing speed skaters to achieve more powerful push-offs through deeper dorsiflexion. Due to this height difference, the two mounting platforms on a frame are usually not contiguous. The standard does not specify frame width or exact mounting locations on the boot. In practice, these result in relatively small contact surfaces between the frame and the boot compared to traditional rivet mounting. However, this is not an issue for rigid speed boots made from fiberglass, and even less so for Bont’s later innovations - kevlar boots (1986) and carbon fiber boots (1989).

Roces Impala skates from the mid 1990s were the first to adopt the 165mm 2-point mounting standard outside of speed skating, paving the way for other inline skate manufacturers to follow. This standard became widely used across various inline skate disciplines, from recreational and aggressive skating to slalom skating. However, unlike speed boots, these disciplines do not rely solely on composite boots with extremely rigid soles. On softer soles, the small mounting platforms can cause the frame to wobble under load. To mitigate this, some boots reinforce the mounting areas with metal plates.

The 165mm standard, also known as SSM (Standard or Short Speed Mount), was developed when speed skates primarily used five small wheels. However, as longer frames with fewer but larger wheels became popular (e.g. 4x100mm), the positioning of the mounting bolts interfered with some wheels, forcing frames to become taller. This increased a skate&#x27;s center of gravity and reduced a skater&#x27;s performance. Some speed frames shift middle wheels or reduce their sizes to fit the standard.

To address this, the 195mm 2-point standard was introduced in 2003, also known as LSM (Long Speed Mount). By increasing the interaxial distance to 195mm, this standard prevented bolts from interfering with middle wheels, enabling the use of larger wheels and longer frames without increasing frame height. This design provides a stable ride at high speeds by maintaining a relatively low center of gravity in proportion to the longer wheelbase.

The 195mm standard retains the same heel lift as the 165mm standard. In general, only speed skating boots use 195mm, while most other inline boots continue to rely on 165mm. However, many inline frames include dual mounting slots on the front mount to accommodate boots of either standard.

=== UFS frames ===

The ESPN X Games introduced aggressive inline skating in 1995, propelling the sport into the spotlight. As its popularity grew, more enthusiasts took up aggressive skating, prompting companies to develop their own specialized skate lines to meet the rising demand.

In 1996, K2 released the Fatty, a legendary skate that integrated the wheel frame into its soulplate for the first time. In this early stage of its evolution, the soulplate still consisted of two separate platforms, a design inherited from the toe and heel mounting platforms of riveted boots, as seen in the Rollerblade Lightning TRS. However, the K2 Fatty reduced the height difference between these platforms, with its frame now forming a solid rectangular bar, eliminating distinct mounting protrusions.

In 1998, Roces too, released an aggressive skate featuring a combined soulplate and frame: the 5th Element. This design not only incorporated a rectangular frame without distinct mounting protrusions but also featured a completely flat soulplate with no height difference between the front and rear sections. This flat sole significantly improved soul grinding and was soon adopted by other skate manufacturers. Additionally, the 5th Element’s integrated soul/frame unit could be easily removed from the boot by loosening just three screws.

In 1999, Salomon, along with USD, Razors, Kizer, 7XL/Able, and Fifty/50, collaborated to establish a standardized mounting system for aggressive skates: the Universal Frame System (UFS). This standard capitalized on the emerging trend of flat soulplates, requiring a single, flat rectangular mounting surface 41mm wide and long enough to accommodate two mounting holes spaced 167mm apart. In 2001, Salomon introduced the Aaron Feinberg Pro Model, the first skate to feature the UFS mounting standard. The model quickly gained popularity and set a new industry benchmark.

Unlike other mounting systems of the time, UFS eliminated built-in heel lift, positioning the heel level with the toes for the first time. However, most brands followed Salomon’s lead in incorporating a thick shock absorber at the heel, providing better impact support for hard landings from high jumps, and accidentally reintroducing a small amount of heel lift.

===Bearings===

Ball bearings allow the wheels to rotate freely and smoothly. Bearings are usually rated on the ABEC scale, a measure of the manufactured precision tolerance, ranging from 1 (worst) to 9 (best) in odd numbers. The ABEC standards were originally intended for high-speed machinery, not skating applications, and do not account for the quality of steel used, which is very important for how long bearings last. While higher rated bearings are generally better in overall quality, whether they automatically translate to more speed is questionable. Since at least 2007, Rollerblade brand amongst others have begun using their own rating system. For instance, Rollerblade brand is currently using a SG1 to SG9 rating system, whereas TwinCam brand is using its own &quot;ILQ&quot; (inline qualified) rating system and Bones brand is using its own &quot;Skate Rated&quot; rating system.

A mistake that is often made in purchasing bearings is that spending more translates to more speed. Generally, clean inline skate bearings contribute about 2% of the rolling resistance that the best urethane inline skate wheels produce, so there is very little opportunity in improving speed by spending more money on bearings. Newer bearings on the market have been offered that use ceramic ball bearings instead of steel, which are more expensive than traditional steel bearings but made of harder material.

Two bearings are used per wheel. The bearings slip into openings molded into each side of the wheel hub, and a flange molded into the wheel hub holds the bearings the correct distance apart. Additionally there is an axle spacer either machined into the axle or that slides over the axle (depending on the axle system used). Since the outer race of the bearing contacts the wheel spacer and the inner race of the bearing contacts the axle spacer, it is critical that the relationship between these two spacers is correct. If the wheel spacer is wider than the axle spacer the bearings will bind when the axle bolt (or bolts) are tightened.

===Wheels===
Wheel sizes vary depending on the skating style.
* for aggressive skating.
* for roller hockey skating.
* for artistic inline skating.
* for freestyle slalom skating and downhill skating.
* for urban skating.
* for general recreational skating.
* for downhill inline skating.
* for tri-skating, mushroom blading, and speed skating.
* tires for off-road skating, and downhill mountain blading with inflatable tires.

Wheels are nowadays almost universally made of polyurethane (a kind of durable plastic). Most other plastics and rubber either wear down too quickly or have too much rolling resistance. In general, the bigger the wheel, the faster the skate. A bigger wheel rolls over road imperfections smoothly thus the less bumpy the skating. On top of that, an inline skater trips far less on large wheels. However, large wheels take more energy to start rolling. Smaller wheels allow faster acceleration, maneuverability, and a lower center of gravity.

Wheel hardness is measured on the A scale (see Durometer) and usually ranges between 72A-93A (lower numbers are softer, higher numbers are harder). Harder wheels are not necessarily faster but tend to be more durable; soft wheels may have better grip and are generally less affected by road bumps. Harder wheels (which grant minimal elastic hysteresis energy absorption) maintain rolling speed far better while softer wheels (because they grip the surface) accelerate more straightforwardly when striding. In the 1990s, wheel rolling resistance (CRR – coefficient of rolling resistance) tended to be minimized with wheel hardness in the 78A durometer range, with rolling resistance dramatically increasing below 75A durometer and above 85A durometer. In the early 2000s, urethane compounds improved significantly, allowing skaters to use harder compounds to get better wheel life, and get the lowest rolling resistance in the 82A–84A durometer range.

Wheel profiles and thickness again vary by application. Elliptic profiles were thought to minimize friction for a faster ride; however, they were intended to mimic the knife-like properties of an ice blade. They helped define the inner, central and outer edges. Elliptic profiles made the wheel quite maneuverable when turning or otherwise crossing over. More rounded profiles provided lower rolling resistance due to the greater &quot;belly&quot; or tire that increased resilience (or &quot;rebound&quot;); and these wheels were perceived as having better grip and being more stable (less like an ice blade), but were heavier than elliptical-profiled wheels and were often used in downhill racing (such as the Hyper Downhill racing wheels) and in recreational skates. Another advantage of rounded profile wheels is longer wear life due to the increased urethane amount on the tire. To increase stability at high speed, skates intended for downhill skating usually have five or six wheels, in contrast with recreational skates, which typically have four wheels. This advantage of more wheels having less rolling resistance has been largely negated by the diameter wheels with 4-wheel trucks. A flat profile allowed the wheel to be even far stabler than the rounded profile. This profile is almost exclusively used on aggressive skate wheels. On the flip-side, the squared-off shape caused cornering to be tremendously harder, seeing how edges are non-existent with a flat profile. In fact, a flat profile has only a center edge preventing the skater from leaning over.

The core&#x27;s general design i.e. material, shape, and flexibility/sturdiness degree at the wheel&#x27;s hub determine the wheel&#x27;s properties as well. In a classical point of view, wheels on older skate models (during the 1980s and early 1990s) contained no core feature whatsoever. The core is a result of the gradual technological improvement inline skating underwent. Above all else, a wheel lacking a core is prone to deformation. This deformation is a hindrance to the skater&#x27;s striding ability since in such a case it minimizes the skater&#x27;s top speed. The core is inserted to hold the polyurethane firmly in place. Despite the setback, markets still distribute special wheels without a core. Core designs vary among open, full or semi-open. &#x27;Spokes&#x27; are an element seen in wheels whose cores are open which generally increase overall wheel lightness. These are inserted into the hubs of wheels for inline speed skates, fitness skates, recreational skates, some slalom skates and artistic/figure inline skates. Apart from spokes, other open-cores can be hollowed out internally. The main disadvantage about an open core is that their design does not permit sturdiness hence they are highly likely to snap under too much pressure i.e. when jumping. Another trade-off with open cores is the lesser amount of polyurethane around it to compensate for the spoked or hollow shape meaning they last shorter. Full cores are entirely solid, akin to a pipe&#x27;s cross-section. This core design is mostly favored amongst aggressive skaters whose leaps off higher levels strain the wheels when landing. Of course, these cores (alongside the extra polyurethane) tend to add weight on the wheel. Some even disfavor the full core design for its rigidity that feels uncomfortable. The question still stands on whether a full core improves power transfer. Semi-open cores are a hybrid between the two previously mentioned cores seen on wheels for urban skates, slalom skates and inline hockey skates. Minuscule holes are typically punctured into these solid cores to provide a semi-open design.

===Heel brakes or toe stops===

A hard rubber brake attached to the heel of the frame allows the skater to stop by lifting the toes of the skate, forcing the brake onto the ground. Learning how to use the heel brake is very important for beginners, as it is the easiest way to stop in emergencies and to control speed on downhills. Also, with practice, beginners realise if the heel brakes are better placed for them on the left/right foot.

Heel brakes can interfere with a useful technique called a crossover turn, in which a skater crosses one leg over another to make a sharp turn without losing much speed; for this reason, most intermediate to advanced users prefer not to use heel brakes. Skaters in the freestyle slalom and aggressive inline skating disciplines do not use heel brakes, since they limit the skater&#x27;s ability to perform tricks effectively. Aggressive inline skates and racing skates generally have no heel brake, thereby permitting extra speed and control.

Inline skaters lacking a heel brake can use various other methods to stop, such as the T-stop in which the skater moves one skate perpendicular to the other, making a &quot;T&quot; shape to increase friction and reduce speed, or the more advanced maneuver of a hockey stop/snow plow stop, in which the skater quickly moves both skates perpendicular to the path of motion.

For artistic roller skating purposes, inline figure skates can also feature a &quot;toe stop&quot; which aids in performing figure skating jumps.

==Wheel setups==

===Flat setup===
A flat setup is the most common setup used on inline skates. Almost all non-aggressive inline skates are sold with a flat wheel setup. Flat means that all the wheels touch the ground at the same time when resting on flat ground. Flat setups are not the most maneuverable but what they lack in maneuverability they make up for in speed. Flat setups tend to be the fastest setups, compared to setups such as the Hi-Lo or anti-rocker. The presence of two middle wheels matching the diametrical size of the rest increases contact points with any surface. They also minimize the rate at which the skater&#x27;s loading weight deforms the wheels. This minimizes the wheel&#x27;s footprint thereby minimizing rolling resistance. Speed skaters and marathon skaters normally use flat setups. This setup also allows for a powerslide, an advanced braking method.

Aggressive skates are sometimes sold with flat setups, but with a small space in the middle for grinding. With aggressive skates, the flat setup obviously leads to better control on the ground when either accelerating on a push or decelerating on a drag because of increased traction. It also grants a faster speed, translating to faster grinds, more powerful pumps in a skate ramp and/or higher heights (&#x27;airs&#x27;) off the edge of a vert ramp. Indeed, flat setups are quick save for the likelihood that they will be heavier and the two standard central wheels tend to &#x27;bite&#x27; when grinding. Similar to skateboarding in certain respects, &#x27;biting&#x27; is a common hindrance during grinding whereby friction between the wheel(s) and surface it comes into contact causes the wheel(s) then entire boot to suddenly reach a halt and the momentum throws the aggressive inline skater off the rail or ledge. Again, the aspect of wheel profile is key here. A harder wheel on a flat setup will slide and &#x27;bite&#x27; less than a softer wheel. Likewise an elliptical profile (Undercover&#x27;s Dustin Werbeski &#x27;super bullet&#x27; wheels for example) possesses less surface area hence it will not bite as much either. Adjusting to a flat setup can even out shock when landing jumps. In doing so, an inline skater&#x27;s hardware like wheels, bearings, axles and the frame itself are twice as much to be spared damage.

It is worth noting that having a flat setup is just one factor in a fast skate setup. A long frame, low resistance bearings, and good technique all contribute greatly to a skater&#x27;s speed.

===Full &#x27;crescent/banana&#x27; rocker===
Full rockers are used by skaters who favor maneuverability when skating on flat ground. Freestyle skaters, freestyle slalom skaters and artistic inline skaters tend to use this setup. Inline hockey players no less can customize their wheels to implement this setup (especially those who favor nimble change in direction over sheer speed during a match). This setup is called &quot;crescent&quot; or &quot;banana&quot; because it is curved, and mimics a curved ice blade profile. On flat ground this setup will only have 1–2 wheels touching the ground at any one time. This makes the skate much easier to pivot but lacks stability so it is harder to balance on. To attain balance when learning to skate a full rocker, it is recommended that pressure and weight are deposited on either the two middle wheels or the two wheels in the back. Avoid applying pressure on the two front wheels when taking strides since this is what will cause instability. In addition, a full rocker is slower than a flat setup in terms of top speed. Worst of all at high speeds, skates with a full rocker setup can experience a speed wobble, where they oscillate uncontrollably. The skater may lose control and crash to the ground.
Flat setups generally wear into a &#x27;natural&#x27; rocker. This is because the front and back wheels seem to receive the vast majority of wear on inline skates.

Having a short frame () in combination with a full rocker is optimum for achieving the highest maneuverability when skating.

===Front rocker===
Front rockers are often used by street skaters who want to combine the ability of a full rocker to handle imperfections in the ground with a flat setup&#x27;s sheer speed. Having a smaller wheel at the front encourages the front wheel to guide the rest of the skate over ground imperfections, rather than digging in and tripping up the less experienced skater. Maintaining a flat profile at the back allows the skater to transfer power through the rear of the skate efficiently to maintain a good speed.

===‘Hi-Lo’ setup===

Some hockey skates inline speed skates include a Hi-Lo setup. Hi-Lo setups resemble a flat setup in that all 4 wheels touch the ground at the same time. Unlike a flat setup, however, different wheel sizes are used. The front two wheels will be smaller than the back two wheels. This is possible because of the location of the axles on the frame itself. One example is a Bauer frame that has two wheels in the front that are and two wheels in the back that are . Another example is a wheel arrangement. This drastically changed the pace at which inline hockey players accelerated. Furthermore, by transferring weight forward, the skater could sprint explosively off the toe section and reduce instances of falling backwards. If the hockey skate is used recreationally outside the arena, the skater will find climbing slopes much easier than on a flat setup. As inline hockey skate manufacturers design frames with varying axle hole placements or even raise the frame&#x27;s back bolt to be higher than the front bolt nowadays, wheels of the same diameter (like ) can be used entirely.

Beyond inline hockey, the Hi-Lo setup was an experimental component seen on K2&#x27;s VO2 100 X Pro where the manufacturers believed that the two smaller wheels ( each) in front would increase stability and rate of acceleration while the two bigger wheels ( each) in the back would maintain high speeds. Essentially this K2 skate model married both wheel size properties. A Hi-Lo configuration on an inline speed skate employs three large sized wheels and a smaller sized wheel between the first and third wheels beneath the ball part of the foot (see speed skates). An example is a arrangement beginning front to back. This increases efficiency now that the foot pushes on a smaller wheel. The smaller wheel lowers deck height off the ground improving stability and keeps the frame length shorter improving maneuverability and comfort amongst speed skaters having a smaller foot size. This is desirable seeing how wheels on inline speed skates are enormous enough to occupy a lot of room in frames. Unfortunately, top speed for a Hi-Lo setup is far less than that for a flat setup where same sized large wheels are used.

===&#x27;TriDi&#x27; Hi-Lo setup===
Another variant of the setup in which there are three diameters of wheels. It is supposed to emphasize the same benefits as the HiLo system but with greater maneuverability due to the smaller front wheels. The configuration is , , , . It allows one to pivot on the third wheel similar to the brand Wizard Skates. This system is also used by some hockey skaters as it pitches the foot slightly forward.

===Aggressive Hi-Lo setup===
A few aggressive skate frames (most notably Rollerblade&#x27;s Switch Frame, Ground Control&#x27;s Bullet Frame, Oysi Frame and Joe Atkinson Sola Frame) are designed so that there are two big outer wheels, and two small inner wheels, rockered so that they all touch the ground. This gives the benefits of a flat setup, while keeping the frame as low as the height of the smaller inner wheels. It also retains room for an H-block in the center. But out bigger outer wheels give some of the benefits bigger wheels offer such as speed and stability.

===Anti-rocker===
Anti-rocker is the most popular setup for aggressive skaters. An anti-rocker wheel is a small hard wheel that replaces the two middle wheels. Anti-rocker wheels almost never touch the ground except in cases where the terrain is uneven, such as skating over a ramp. Anti-rockers can be made of plastic, or high density polyurethane. Some use bearings so that they can spin. As they can spin, the anti-rockers wear out more evenly when grinding. Anti-rockers containing bearings can effectively roll over uneven ground or features like steps, lessening tripping hazards. Others do not use bearings so that they&#x27;re lighter. The anti-rockers themselves lock the H-block onto the ledge or rail a skater grinds. There is a minor nuisance to anti-rocker hardware in which the items emit a loud noise upon fastening into a grind that some aggressive skaters find unbearable. The anti-rocker setup altogether makes maneuvering harder (since the standard wheels slip more), wheel life shorter, overall speed slower, a rougher ride, and a wider turning radius, but because of the extra space in the middle, it makes grinding objects much easier than with a flat setup.

===Freestyle===
The freestyle frame is another setup used by aggressive skaters. This setup simply has only two wheels – one in the front and one in the back. In between the two wheels is an area of solid material, resembling a large &quot;H Block&quot;, which is used for grinding. Freestyle frames have nearly identical advantages to the Anti-rocker. Since large space is freed up in the middle, the skater can not only grind wider surface areas like an entire ledge but also the frame&#x27;s weight is lighter. Likewise, the Freestyle frame shares its disadvantages with its Anti-rocker cousin already listed. As opposed to anti-rockers which securely lock grinds, aggressive skaters should train themselves to remain balanced when sliding across narrow rails or edges on a Freestyle frame. Worse still when not observing carefulness, a Freestyle setup can easily hook on vertical surfaces including steps, coping and funbox edges if you roll over them, leading to tripping incidents. This is why the technique to &#x27;bash&#x27; (see &quot;Flat Setup&quot;) a staircase is almost impossible on a Freestyle setup. Freestyle frames can be purchased, although removing the two inner wheels of a flat or anti-rocker frame technically makes it freestyle, however this would not be very durable due to the lack of solid grinding material. Originally invented by Fifty-50 (an aggressive inline skate frame company), Juice Blocks allow the skater to convert their flat or anti-rocker frames into proper freestyle frames. Juice Blocks are simply solid grind blocks inserted into the axle holes where two middle wheels or anti-rockers are found.

===Tri-rocker===
Tri-rocker (not to be confused with the 3-wheeled frame/chassis seen on Tri-Skates) is used by some aggressive skaters. It is another method of making grinds easier. A frame with a tri-rocker setup has only one wheel in the middle, either in the second wheel position or in the third wheel position, depending on what kinds of grinds the skater plans on doing. The remaining axle has an anti-rocker wheel, a special grind block, or is just left empty.

The purpose of a tri-rocker setup is to give the skater good speed and maneuverability, like on a flat setup. But because of the extra space, grinding is also a little easier than a flat setup.

<text>The Philadelphia Inquirer, often referred to simply as The Inquirer, is a daily newspaper headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Founded on June 1, 1829, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; is the third-longest continuously operating daily newspaper in the United States.

The newspaper has the largest circulation of any newspaper in both Pennsylvania and the Delaware Valley metropolitan region, which includes Philadelphia and its surrounding communities in southeastern Pennsylvania, South Jersey, northern Delaware, and the northern Eastern Shore of Maryland. As of 2020, the newspaper has the 17th-largest circulation of any newspaper in the United States As of 2020, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; has won 20 Pulitzer Prizes.

Several decades after its 1829 founding, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; began emerging as one of the nation&#x27;s major newspapers during the American Civil War. Its circulation dropped after the Civil War&#x27;s conclusion, but it rose again by the end of the 19th century. Originally supportive of the Democratic Party, &quot;The Inquirer&quot;″s political orientation eventually shifted toward the Whig Party and then the Republican Party before stating, in the mid-20th century, that it was politically independent.

By the end of the 1960s, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; trailed its chief competitor, &quot;The Philadelphia Evening Bulletin&quot; in circulation, and was lacking modern facilities and experienced staff. In the 1970s, however, following its acquisition by Knight Ridder and the hiring of new editors, it once again emerged as one of the nation&#x27;s most prominent and influential newspapers.

&quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; is owned by The Philadelphia Inquirer, LLC, which also publishes &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot;, the city&#x27;s daily tabloid, and the news portal philly.com. As of 2023, the newspaper&#x27;s publisher and chief executive officer is Elizabeth H. Hughes, and its editor is Gabriel Escobar.

==History==
===19th century===

&quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; was founded June 1, 1829, by printer John R. Walker and John Norvell, former editor of Philadelphia&#x27;s largest newspaper, the &quot;Aurora &amp; Gazette&quot;. An editorial in the first issue of &quot;The Pennsylvania Inquirer&quot; promised that the paper would be devoted to the right of a minority to voice their opinion and &quot;the maintenance of the rights and liberties of the people, equally against the abuses as the usurpation of power.&quot; They pledged support to then-President Andrew Jackson and &quot;home industries, American manufactures, and internal improvements that so materially contribute to the agricultural, commercial and national prosperity.&quot;

&quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; is the third-oldest surviving daily newspaper in the United States. In 1962, an &quot;Inquirer&quot;-commissioned historian traced &quot;The Inquirer&quot; to John Dunlap&#x27;s &quot;The Pennsylvania Packet&quot;, which was founded on October 28, 1771.

In 1850, &quot;The Packet&quot; was merged with another newspaper, &quot;The North American&quot;, which later merged with the &quot;Philadelphia Public Ledger&quot;. The &quot;Public Ledger&quot;, in turn, merged with &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; in the 1930s.

Between 1962 and 1975, a line on &quot;The Inquirer&quot;″s front page claimed that the newspaper is the United States&#x27; oldest surviving daily newspaper. If the lineage of &quot;The Packet&quot; and &quot;The North American&quot; is counted in the newspaper&#x27;s history, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; would currently be the longest continuously published newspaper in the nation.

Six months after &quot;The Inquirer&quot; was founded, with competition from eight established daily newspapers, lack of funds forced Norvell and Walker to sell the newspaper to publisher and &quot;United States Gazette&quot; associate editor Jesper Harding. In 1829, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; moved from its original location between Front and 2nd streets to between 2nd and 3rd streets. After Harding acquired &quot;The Pennsylvania Inquirer&quot;, it was briefly published as an afternoon paper before returning to its original morning format in January 1830.

When Harding bought and merged the &quot;Morning Journal&quot; in January 1830, the newspaper was moved to South Second Street. Ten years later, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; moved again, this time to its own building at the corner of Third Street and Carter&#x27;s Alley.

Harding expanded &quot;The Inquirer&quot;&#x27;s content, and the newspaper soon grew into a major Philadelphia newspaper. The expanded content included the addition of fiction. In 1840, Harding gained rights to publish several Charles Dickens novels for which Dickens was paid a significant sum, even though the common practice was to pay little or nothing for the rights of foreign authors&#x27; works.

Harding retired in 1859, and was succeeded by his son, William White Harding, who had become a partner three years earlier. William Harding changed the name of the newspaper to its current name, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. In an attempt to increase circulation, Harding cut the price of the paper, began delivery routes and had newsboys sell papers on the street.

====American Civil War====
In 1859, circulation had been around 7,000; by 1863 it had increased to 70,000. Part of the increase was due to the interest in news during the American Civil War. An estimated 25,000 to 30,000 copies of &quot;The Inquirer&quot; were distributed to Union Army soldiers during the war and several times the U.S. government asked &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; to publish special editions for its soldiers. &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; supported the Union, but Harding wanted their coverage to remain neutral. Confederate generals often sought copies of the paper, believing that the newspaper&#x27;s war coverage was accurate.

During the Civil War, &quot;Inquirer&quot; journalist Uriah Hunt Painter was at the First Battle of Bull Run in 1861, a battle which ended in a Confederate victory. Initial reports from the government claimed a Union victory, but &quot;The Inquirer&quot; went with Painter&#x27;s firsthand account. Crowds threatened to burn &quot;The Inquirer&quot; building down because of the report. Another report about General George Meade angered him enough that he punished Edward Crapsey, the reporter who wrote it. Crapsey and other Civil War correspondents at the newspaper later decided to attribute any victories of the Army of the Potomac, Meade&#x27;s command, to Ulysses S. Grant, commander of the Union Army. Any defeats, conversely, were attributed to Meade.

During the Civil War, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; continued to grow with more staff being added and another move into a larger building on Chestnut Street. Following the Civil War, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; faced financial challenges, and Harding became ill. Despite Philadelphia&#x27;s population growth, distribution fell from 70,000 during the Civil War to 5,000 in 1888.

In 1889, the newspaper was sold to publisher James Elverson, who moved &quot;The Inquirer&quot; to a new building that included the latest printing technology. Elverson also increased the newspaper&#x27;s staff. A new &quot;Inquirer&quot; premiered on March 1, 1889, and was successful enough that Elverson launched a Sunday edition of the newspaper. In 1890, in an attempt to increase circulation further, the price of &quot;The Inquirer&quot; was cut and the paper&#x27;s size was increased, mostly with classified advertisements. After five years, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; had to move into a larger building on Market Street and later expanded further into an adjacent property.

===20th century===

After Elverson&#x27;s death in 1911, his son by his wife Sallie Duvall, James Elverson Jr. took charge. Under Elverson Jr., the newspaper continued to grow, eventually needing to move again. Elverson Jr. bought land at Broad and Callowhill Streets and built the 18-story Elverson Building, now known as the Inquirer Building. The first issue of &quot;The Inquirer&quot; was printed at the new building on July 13, 1925. Four years later, in 1929, Elverson Jr. died, and his sister, Eleanor Elverson Patenôtre, widow of Jules Patenôtre, assumed leadership of &quot;The Inquirer&quot;.

Patenôtre ordered cuts throughout the paper, but was not really interested in managing it, and ownership of the newspaper was put up for sale. Cyrus Curtis and Curtis-Martin Newspapers Inc. bought the newspaper on March 5, 1930.

Curtis died a year later and his stepson-in-law, John Charles Martin, took charge. Martin merged &quot;The Inquirer&quot; with another paper, the &quot;Public Ledger&quot;, but the Great Depression hurt Curtis-Martin Newspapers and the company defaulted in payments of maturity notes. Ownership of &quot;The Inquirer&quot; then returned to the Patenôtre family and Elverson Corp.

Charles A. Taylor was elected president of The Inquirer Co. and ran the paper until it was sold to Moses L. Annenberg in 1936. During the period between Elverson Jr. and Annenberg &quot;The Inquirer&quot; stagnated, its editors ignoring most of the poor economic news of the Depression. The lack of growth allowed J. David Stern&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Philadelphia Record&quot;, to surpass &quot;The Inquirer&quot; in circulation and become the largest newspaper in Pennsylvania.

Under Moses Annenberg, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; turned around. Annenberg added new features, increased staff and held promotions to increase circulation. By November 1938 &quot;Inquirer&quot;&#x27;s weekday circulation increased to 345,422 from 280,093 in 1936. During that same period the &quot;Record&quot;&#x27;s circulation had dropped to 204,000 from 328,322.

In 1939, Annenberg was charged with income tax evasion. Annenberg pleaded guilty before his trial and was sentenced to three years in prison. While incarcerated, he fell ill and died from a brain tumor six weeks after his release from prison in June 1942. Upon Moses Annenberg&#x27;s death, his son, Walter Annenberg, took over.

In 1947, the &quot;Record&quot; went out of business, and &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; emerged as Philadelphia&#x27;s only major daily morning newspaper. While still trailing behind Philadelphia&#x27;s largest newspaper, the &quot;Evening Bulletin&quot;, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; also continued to operate profitably.

In 1948, Walter Annenberg expanded the Inquirer Building with a new structure that housed new printing presses for &quot;The Inquirer&quot;. During the 1950s and 1960s, Annenberg acquired &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine and &quot;TV Guide&quot;.

In 1957, Annenberg bought the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; and combined the &quot;Daily News&quot;&#x27; facilities with &quot;The Inquirer&quot;&#x27;s.

In 1958, a 38-day strike in 1958 hurt &quot;The Inquirer&quot; and, following the strike, so many reporters had accepted buyout offers and left that the newsroom was noticeably empty, leaving many copy clerks with little experience responsible for reporting.

One of the few star reporters of the 1950s and 1960s was investigative reporter Harry Karafin, who exposed corruption and wrote exclusive stories for &quot;The Inquirer&quot;, but also extorted money out of individuals and organizations. Karafin told sources that he had harmful information on them, and would demand money in exchange for him not making the information public. This went on from the late 1950s into the early 1960s before Karafin was exposed in 1967 and was subsequently convicted of extortion a year later, in 1968. As the newspaper entered the 1970s, circulation and advertising revenue was declining, and the newspaper had become, as &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported, &quot;uncreative and undistinguished.&quot;

===Corporate ownership===
In 1969, Samuel Newhouse offered Annenberg $55 million to acquire &quot;The Inquirer&quot;. But having earlier promised John S. Knight the right of first refusal to any sale, Annenberg instead sold the newspaper to Knight, and &quot;The Inquirer&quot; and &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; became part of Knight Newspapers and its new subsidiary, Philadelphia Newspapers Inc. (PNI). Five years later, in 1974, Knight Newspapers merged with Ridder Publications to form Knight Ridder.

When &quot;The Inquirer&quot; was acquired, it was understaffed, its equipment was largely outdated, many of its employees were underskilled, and the newspaper trailed its chief competitor, the &quot;Evening Bulletin&quot;, in weekday circulation. In 1972, however, Eugene L. Roberts Jr. became &quot;The Inquirer&quot; executive editor, and once again turned the newspaper around.

Between 1975 and 1990, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; won seventeen Pulitzers, six of which were won in consecutive years between 1975 and 1980, and the newspaper won more journalism awards than any other newspaper in the United States. &quot;Time&quot; magazine named &quot;The Inquirer&quot; one of the ten best daily newspapers in the United States, calling Roberts&#x27; changes to the paper, &quot;one of the most remarkable turnarounds, in quality and profitability, in the history of American journalism.&quot;

In 1980, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; had emerged as the most circulated paper in Philadelphia, forcing the &quot;Evening Bulletin&quot; to shut down two years later. Between 1970 and 1985, however, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; experienced eleven strikes, the longest of which, in 1985, lasted 46 days. &quot;The Inquirer&quot; also faced criticism for its expanded international coverage, which led &quot;Time&quot; magazine to report that it was covering &quot;Karachi better than Kensington&quot;.

Throughout the 1980s, however, the newspaper continued to grow. When the &quot;Evening Bulletin&quot; shut down in 1982, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; hired 17 &quot;Bulletin&quot; reporters and doubled its bureaus to attract former &quot;Bulletin&quot; readers. By 1989, Philadelphia Newspapers Inc.&#x27;s editorial staff reached a peak of 721 employees.

In the 1990s, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; again confronted challenges with diminishing circulation and advertisement revenue. While part of a nationwide trend, the impact was exacerbated by, according to dissatisfied &quot;Inquirer&quot; employees, the newspaper resisting changes that many other daily newspapers implemented to keep readers and pressure from Knight Ridder to cut operating costs.

During most of Roberts&#x27;s time as editor, Knight Ridder allowed him a great deal of freedom in running the newspaper. In the late 1980s, however, Knight Ridder expressed concern about &quot;The Inquirer&quot; profitability and took a more active role in its operations. Knight Ridder pressured &quot;The Inquirer&quot; to expand into the more profitable Philadelphia suburbs, while at the same time cutting staff and coverage of national and international stories. Some of &quot;The Inquirer&quot; best reporters accepted buyouts, and left for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. By the late 1990s, all of the high-level editors who had worked with Roberts in the 1970s and 1980s had left, none at normal retirement age.

Since the 1980s, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; has won three Pulitzers: a 1997 award for &quot;Explanatory Journalism.&quot;, the public service award (the top category) in 2012 for &quot;its coverage of pervasive violence in the city&#x27;s schools&quot;, and the 2014 prize for criticism, won by the newspaper&#x27;s architecture critic, Inga Saffron.

In 1998, &quot;Inquirer&quot; reporter Ralph Cipriano filed a libel suit against Knight Ridder, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, and &quot;Inquirer&quot; editor Robert Rosenthal over comments Rosenthal made about Cipriano to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, claiming it was difficult reporting negative stories in &quot;The Inquirer&quot; about the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia. Rosenthal later claimed that Cipriano had &quot;a very strong personal point of view and an agenda...He could never prove (his stories).&quot; The suit was later settled out of court in 2001.

===21st century===
In the early 21st century, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; launched an online news desk to compete with local Philadelphia radio stations in the coverage of breaking news.

In June 2006, Knight Ridder was acquired by its rival, The McClatchy Company. &quot;The Inquirer&quot; and the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; were among the 12 least profitable Knight Ridder newspapers that McClatchy put up for sale in March 2006.

On June 29, 2006, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; and &quot;Daily News&quot; were sold to Philadelphia Media Holdings LLC (PMH), a group of Philadelphia-area business people, including Brian Tierney, PMH&#x27;s chief executive. The new owners announced plans to spend US$5 million on advertisements and promotions to increase &quot;The Inquirer&quot;&#x27;s profile and readership.

Following PMH&#x27;s acquisition, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; advertising and other revenue, especially its national advertising revenue, fell considerably, and the newspaper&#x27;s circulation also continued to fall. As a result, the newspaper&#x27;s management cut 400 jobs at &quot;The Inquirer&quot; and &quot;Daily News&quot; between 2006 and 2009.

On February 21, 2009, despite cutting its operating costs, however, Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with the company holding approximately US$390 million in debt, much of which was borrowed to acquire &quot;The Inquirer&quot; and &quot;Daily News&quot;.

The bankruptcy filing kicked off a year-long dispute between Philadelphia Media Holdings and its creditors. Creditors, including banks and hedge funds, sought to take control of Philadelphia Newspapers LLC themselves and opposed efforts by Philadelphia Media Holdings to maintain control of the newspaper&#x27;s operations. Philadelphia Media Holdings was supported by most of the newspaper&#x27;s unions. It also launched a public relations campaign to promote its continued control of the newspaper, highlighting the value of local ownership of media.

On April 28, 2010, at a bankruptcy auction, the group of lending creditors and a group of local investors allied with Tierney both bid for &quot;The Inquirer&quot; and &quot;Daily News&quot;. The lenders emerged with the winning bid for the newspapers, but the deal collapsed after the lenders, operating under the name of Philadelphia Media Network (PMN), were unable to reach a contract agreement with the union representing the company&#x27;s newspaper delivery drivers.

Philadelphia Newspapers, represented by Lawrence G. McMichael of Dilworth Paxson LLP, challenged the right of creditors to credit bid at a bankruptcy auction. Their claim was ultimately heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which agreed that that credit bidding was not permitted.

In September 2010, both newspapers again were placed for auction, and again Philadelphia Media Network (PMN) won the bid. After successfully negotiating a contract with all of the newspaper&#x27;s 14 unions, the $139 million deal was finalized on October 8.

&quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; continued with profitability, largely due to emerging competition from digital media sources. By May 2012, the combined journalist staff at all of Philadelphia Media Network was about 320, and some of the same stories and photographs appear both in &quot;The Inquirer&quot; and &quot;Daily News&quot;.

On April 2, 2012, a group of local business leaders paid $55 million for the newspaper, less than 15 percent of the $515 million spent to buy the papers in 2006.

In June 2014, PMN was sold to H.F. &quot;Gerry&quot; Lenfest, who appointed C.Z. &quot;Terry&quot; Egger as publisher and chief executive officer four months later, in October 2015.

In 2016, Lenfest donated PMN to The Philadelphia Foundation, so that &quot;The Inquirer&quot;, its daily tabloid affiliate, the &quot;Daily News&quot;, and their joint website, Philly.com, could remain in Philadelphia.

In October 2011, Philadelphia Media Network sold the Inquirer Building to Bart Blatstein, a developer affiliated with Tower Investments Inc., who said he intended to turn the complex into a mixed-use complex of offices retail and apartments. The following month, however, publisher and chief executive officer Gregory J. Osberg announced that 600 of the 740 Philadelphia Media Network employees of &quot;The Inquirer&quot;, &quot;Daily News&quot;, and Philly.com would move to office space in the former Strawbridge &amp; Clothier department store on east Market Street, and that the remaining employees would move to offices in the Philadelphia suburbs.

In July 2012, Philadelphia Media Network moved to the new location, consolidating its offices on the building&#x27;s third floor. Cutbacks left much of the of the Inquirer Building empty, but the east Market Street location consolidated Philadelphia Media&#x27;s departments, including the &quot;Daily News&quot; newsroom with &quot;The Inquirer&quot;. The new location has a street-level lobby and event room. Plans for the building also included electronic signage such as a news ticker on the corner of the Center City Philadelphia high-rise.

In 2019, Philadelphia Media Network renamed Philly.com to Inquirer.com, and the &quot;Daily News&quot; was made an edition of &quot;The Inquirer&quot;. Philadelphia Media Network, in turn, was renamed The Philadelphia Inquirer, LLC.

In 2019, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; also became a founding member of Spotlight PA, an investigative reporting partnership focused on Pennsylvania.

On June 2, 2020, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; ran an Inga Saffron article covering the George Floyd protests under the headline &quot;Buildings Matter, Too&quot;, a reference to property damage inflicted by Black Lives Matter during the Floyd protests.

On June 3, however, editors of &quot;The Inquirer&quot; apologized for the headline and several &quot;Inquirer&quot; journalists wrote an open letter, alleging that the newspaper was failing to report accurately on the Philadelphia area&#x27;s non-white communities. The letter demanded a plan for correcting these issues, threatening to call in &quot;sick and tired&quot; beginning the following day, June 4, if the concerns were not addressed. The letter read in part:

On June 4, as promised in their letter, over 40 &quot;Inquirer&quot; staffers called in sick. Two days later, on June 6, the newspaper announced that Stan Wischnowski would resign as the newspaper&#x27;s senior vice president and executive editor, and &quot;Inquirer&quot; journalists were told they would not have a say in his replacement. In 2022, the paper admitted to its own racism, both in publishing the article and across the organization.

In May 2023, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; was severely disrupted by a cyberattack.

==Politics==

Since its founding in 1829, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; has asserted itself editorially on political issues of the day. In its earliest days, John Norvell left as editor of what was then the &quot;Aurora &amp; Gazette&quot; because he disagreed with what he felt was the newspaper&#x27;s editorial approval of a movement towards a European class system.

When Norvell and John Walker founded &quot;The Inquirer&quot;, they wanted the newspaper to represent all people and not just its upper classes. The newly launched newspaper supported the ideology of Jeffersonian democracy and the political leadership of then U.S. president Andrew Jackson, declaring support for the right of the minority&#x27;s opinion to be heard. In founding of &quot;The Inquirer&quot;, according to legend, Norvell said, &quot;There could be no better name than &quot;The Inquirer&quot;. In a free state, there should always be an inquirer asking on behalf of the people: &#x27;Why was this done? Why is that necessary work not done? Why is that man put forward? Why is that law proposed? Why? Why? Why?&quot;

When Norvell and Walker sold their newspaper to Jesper Harding, Harding kept the newspaper close to the founder&#x27;s politics and supported the Democratic Party. However, Harding disagreed with Andrew Jackson&#x27;s handling of the Second Bank of the United States, and he began supporting the anti-Jackson wing of the Democrats. During the 1836 Presidential election, Harding supported the Whig party candidate over the Democratic candidate, which led &quot;The Inquirer&quot; to become known as a pro-Whig newspaper.

Before the American Civil War commenced in 1861 &quot;The Inquirer&quot; supported the preservation of the Union, and was critical of the abolitionist movement, which some felt was responsible for succession of Confederate states.

Once the Civil War began, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; reported neutrally and independently on the war, but firmly supported the Union. At first, editors of &quot;The Inquirer&quot; opposed emancipation. Following military setbacks of the Union Army, however, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; began editorializing in support of a more pro-Union and pro-Republican stance. In a July 1862 article, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; wrote, &quot;in this war there can be but two parties, patriots and traitors.&quot;

When James Elverson assumed leadership of &quot;The Inquirer&quot;, he declared, &quot;the new &quot;Inquirer&quot; shall be in all respects a complete, enterprising, progressive newspaper, moved by all the wide-awake spirit of the time and behind in nothing of interest to people who want to know what is going on every day and everywhere...steadily and vigorously Republican in its political policy, but just and fair in its treatment of all questions...&quot;

During the 1900 Republican convention in Philadelphia, Elverson set up a large electric banner over Broad Street that declared &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer – Largest Republican Circulation in the World.&quot;

At the turn of the 20th century, the newspaper began editorial campaigns to improve Philadelphia, including the paving of major streets and ending what the newspaper saw as a corrupt plan to buy the polluted Schuylkill Canal for drinking water. The newspaper maintained these editorial positions under Elverson&#x27;s son, Elverson Jr.. By the 1920s, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; became known as the &quot;Republican Bible of Pennsylvania&quot;.

Between 1929 and 1936, while under Patenotre and Curtis-Martin, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; continued to support the Republican party and President Herbert Hoover, and did not provide much reporting on Great Depression. Statistics on unemployment or business closings were ignored, even when they were conveyed by the federal government. As some Philadelphia banks closed during the Great Depression, news of their closing was relegated to the back of the newspaper&#x27;s financial section.

When Moses Annenberg assumed leadership of &quot;The Inquirer&quot;, he announced that the newspaper would &quot;continue to uphold the principles of the Republican Party.&quot; But in a meeting with newspaper editors shortly after, he proposed that the paper go independent and support President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the upcoming presidential election. The newspaper&#x27;s editors at the time rejected this idea, and the paper remained largely Republican.

In the late 1930s, Annenberg disagreed with Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal programs and his handling of strikes, leading to editorials in &quot;The Inquirer&quot; that criticized Roosevelt&#x27;s policies and his supporters. Annenberg strongly opposed Democratic Pennsylvania governor George Earle, and &quot;The Inquirer&quot; supported Republican candidates in the 1938 Pennsylvania state elections. When Republicans swept the election, there was a celebration at &quot;The Inquirer&quot; headquarters that included red flares and the firing of cannons. The attacks against Democrats and the support given Republicans caught the attention of the Roosevelt administration.

Under Annenberg, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; emerged as a major challenger to &quot;The Record&quot;, which was supportive of Democrats. As Annenberg began focusing on politics, Democratic politicians often attacked Annenberg, accusing him of illegal business practices. In 1939, Annenberg was charged with income tax evasion. He pleaded guilty prior to his trial, and was sentenced to three years in prison. Annenberg&#x27;s friends and his son, Walter, claimed that the entire trial was politically motivated and that his sentence was excessively harsh.

===Independent===
In 1947, &quot;The Record&quot;, the primary Philadelphia competitor of &quot;The Inquirer&quot;, ceased operations, and &quot;The Inquirer&quot; announced that it would be an independent newspaper.
Frustrated with corruption in Philadelphia, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; supported Democratic candidates in the 1951 election.

While Walter Annenberg promised that &quot;The Inquirer&quot; would be politically independent, he still used the newspaper to attack people he disliked, sometimes including a person or group with whom he was angered. Annenberg then blacklisted the person or group, insisting that they not be mentioned in &quot;The Inquirer&quot;. People on the blacklist were even airbrushed out of images. Annenberg&#x27;s blacklist included Nicholas Katzenbach, Ralph Nader, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and the Philadelphia Warriors, the city&#x27;s professional basketball team at the time, who Annenberg insisted not be mentioned for an entire season.

In 1966, Walter Annenberg used &quot;The Inquirer&quot; to attack Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Milton Shapp. During a press conference, an &quot;Inquirer&quot; reporter asked Shapp if he had ever been a patient in a mental hospital; having never been a patient, Shapp said no. The following day, &quot;The Inquirer&quot;″s headline read, &quot;Shapp Denies Rumors He Had Psychiatric Treatment in 1965.&quot; Shapp attributed his loss of the election to Annenberg&#x27;s attack campaign.

Annenberg was a backer and friend of Richard Nixon. In the 1952 presidential election, critics later claimed Annenberg and the newspaper looked the other way when covering allegations related to Nixon&#x27;s purported misappropriation of funds. Later, to avoid accusations of political bias, Annenberg had &quot;The Inquirer&quot; use only the Associated Press and other news wire services in covering the 1960 and 1968 presidential elections in which Nixon was a candidate, losing in 1960 to John F. Kennedy and winning in 1968 in a three-way race against Hubert Humphrey and George Wallace.

After Nixon&#x27;s election as president in 1968, he appointed Annenberg U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom. A year later, in 1969, Annenberg sold &quot;The Inquirer&quot; to Knight Newspapers in a transaction that stipulated that Annenberg&#x27;s name would appear as &quot;Editor and Publisher Emeritus&quot; on &quot;The Inquirer&quot; masthead. In 1970, Annenberg, unhappy with the direction of &quot;The Inquirer&quot; under the new ownership, had his name removed from the newspaper&#x27;s masthead following its publication of an editorial critical of Richard Nixon.

Under Knight Ridder, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; continued to insist that it remained editorially independent, but the newspaper faced criticism from conservatives, who labeled it left leaning. Although the Inquirer was known as the &quot;Republican Bible of Pennsylvania&quot; in the early 1900s, as of 2006, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; had not endorsed a Republican candidate for president for over a quarter century, when it endorsed Gerald Ford in the 1976 presidential election.

Throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century, the newspaper also faced criticism for its coverage of Israel, including from the Zionist Organization of America, which accused &quot;The Inquirer&quot; of being anti-Israel.

In 2006, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; became one of the only major United States newspapers to print one of the &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; Muhammad cartoons. Following its publication, Muslims picketed outside The Inquirer Building to protest their printing.

When Philadelphia Media Holdings L.L.C. (PMH) bought the paper in 2006, Brian Tierney and the business people associated with PMH signed a pledge promising that they would not seek to influence the content of the newspaper. Tierney, a Republican advertising and public relations executive, had criticized &quot;The Inquirer&quot; in the past on behalf of his clients, including the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, which he had represented.

In 2012, the sale of &quot;The Inquirer&quot; to six local Philadelphia business leaders led to concerns of conflict of interest. The new owners, which included New Jersey Democratic fundraiser George Norcross III, media entrepreneur H. F. Lenfest, former New Jersey Nets owner Lewis Katz, and CEO of Liberty Property Trust and chairman of the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce William Hankowsky, pledged not to influence the content of the paper.

==Workforce==
In March 2020, The NewsGuild of Greater Philadelphia and Philadelphia Inquirer LLC reached an agreement on a three-year contract agreement that would include a workforce diversity provision and raises for the entire newsroom, which had not seen across the board salary increases since August 2009. NewsGuild membership ratified the three-year contract agreement on March 17, 2020.

===Demographics===
&quot;The Inquirer&quot; has 225 newsroom employees. 54.7% of whom are male and 45.3% of whom are female. Critics have alleged that the racial demographics of the newsroom, which is 75 percent White, does not match the city it covers, which is only 34% White. However, these allegations appear to exclude the broader circulation of the newspaper, which stretches beyond the city of Philadelphia, which is approximately 60% White and approximately 20% Black.

As of 2021, three quarters of the editors of &quot;The Inquirer&quot; were White. As of 2023, three desks – Health, Investigations and Now – have no Black journalists.

==Production==
&quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; is headquartered at 100 S. Independence Mall west in the Market East section of Center City Philadelphia, where its tabloid sister publication, the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; is also headquartered.

In September 1994, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; and WPHL-TV began co-producing a 10 p.m. newscast, &quot;Inquirer News Tonight&quot;, which lasted a year before WPHL-TV took complete control over the program and renamed it &quot;WB17 News at Ten&quot;.

Since 1995, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; has been available on the Internet, most recently at Inquirer.com, which, along with the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News,&quot; is part of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer LLC.&quot; 

In 2004, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; formed a partnership with Philadelphia&#x27;s NBC station, WCAU, giving the paper access to WCAU&#x27;s weather forecasts while also contributing to news segments throughout the day.

In 2020, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; closed its Schuylkill Printing Plant in Upper Merion Township, laying off about 500 employees. , printing of &quot;The Inquirer&quot; and the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; has been outsourced to a printing plant in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, which is owned by Gannett.

, &quot;The Inquirer&quot; publisher is Elizabeth H. Hughes, and its editor and senior vice president is Gabriel Escobar. Managing editors are Charlotte Sutton, Patrick Kerkstra, Richard G. Jones, Michael Huang, Kate Dailey and Danese Kenon. Deputy managing editors are Brian Leighton, James Neff, Ross Maghielse, Molly Eichel and Ariella Cohen.

<doc id="102956" wikidata="Q446290" url="?curid=102956" title="Laraine Newman">
<text>Laraine Newman (born March 2, 1952) is an American actress, comedian, and writer. Newman was part of the original cast of NBC&#x27;s sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from its inception in 1975 until her departure in 1980. 

Newman took an interest in improv at Beverly Hills High School. After graduating in 1970, she studied mime with Marcel Marceau for a year in Paris. She then moved to Los Angeles and became a founding member of comedy improvisational group The Groundlings. She was first hired by Lorne Michaels for a Lily Tomlin TV special in 1974. The next year Newman became one of the original cast members of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, working there from 1975 to 1980 and creating characters Connie Conehead, proto-Valley girl Sherry, and Christie Christina. In 2017, she and the rest of the original cast members of &quot;SNL&quot; were among the honorees of the Television Academy Hall of Fame.

She appeared in &quot;Stardust Memories&quot;, &quot;Problem Child 2&quot;, &quot;Coneheads&quot;, and &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. She is also a voice actor in both TV and movies, including Pixar films &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, &quot;WALL-E&quot;, &quot;Up&quot;, and &quot;Inside Out&quot;. In 2021 her memoir &quot;May You Live in Interesting Times&quot; was released on Audible.

She is the younger sister of writer and musician Tracy Newman, and the mother of actress and comedian Hannah Einbinder and actor Spike Einbinder.

==Personal life==
Newman was born on March 2, 1952, in Los Angeles, California, the granddaughter of a cattle rancher from Arizona. Her family is Jewish. She is the youngest of four children and has a twin brother Paul. Her sister, Tracy Newman, is an Emmy Award–winning television writer. Newman attended Beverly Hills High School in Beverly Hills, California and graduated from there in 1970. Newman married actor-writer-director Chad Einbinder in 1991; their marriage ended after 25 years. Newman and Einbinder have two children, Spike and Hannah, who are both actors and comedians.

The song &quot;Never Let Her Slip Away,&quot; written and recorded by Andrew Gold, was about Newman. The two were a couple at the time. The song hit #5 on the UK charts in 1978.

==Early life and career==
Newman took her first improvisational theatre classes when she was 15. After finishing high school she auditioned for four acting schools in England including the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art and Bristol Old Vic. She was not accepted to any of them, so she went to Paris to study mime with Marcel Marceau for a year.

By the age of 19, Newman returned to the United States, and moved to Los Angeles, where she did a brief stint at a secretarial school. Committed to continue performing, she was a founding member of the pioneering comedy improvisational group The Groundlings. At the same time, Newman was working for a booking agent who worked with rock bands, typing up contracts.

Newman cites Eve Arden, Madeline Kahn and Richard Pryor as her first major influences, saying &quot;They led me into my life of comedy, they led me into understanding &#x27;The Art of Play&#x27;.&quot;

==&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;==
In 1974, Lorne Michaels hired 22-year-old Newman for a Lily Tomlin special, impressed with her work as founder and original member of The Groundlings. A year later, she became an original cast member on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, appearing on the show from its inception in 1975 through 1980.

During her five years on &quot;SNL&quot; she became a close friend of co-star Gilda Radner, although there was also a degree of rivalry between them. The instant success of &quot;SNL&quot; propelled her to stardom very quickly. Newman recalled being stopped in the street in New York City by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who introduced themselves to her.

Newman admits that she was &quot;never a good improviser,&quot; but when in character, like an angry Jewish poet, a flight attendant, an eccentric chef, or a British groupie, she was &quot;free&quot;. Commenting on her early experiences during &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; she said: &quot;When I first performed (my characters) and the audience responded, I felt like crying, I mean the idea that what I saw—what other people saw—(meant) I wasn&#x27;t so alone in my perspective. I hope this doesn&#x27;t sound too overblown, but it really did feel like a Communion.&quot;

However, by her own account, Newman was unhappy for much of her time with the show. She disliked living in New York, and during her years on &quot;SNL&quot;, Newman had developed serious eating disorders, as well as a heroin addiction. She spent so much time in her dressing room playing solitaire that for Christmas 1979, castmate Radner gave her a deck of playing cards with a picture of Newman on the face of each card.

Newman was photographed as a vampire by Francesco Scavullo for the July 1978 issue of &quot;High Times&quot;. The accompanying interview introduced Newman as the &quot;Skinny spaced-out sex symbol of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.&quot;

===Recurring characters on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;===
Newman is best known for her roles as Connie Conehead, proto-Valley girl Sherry, and Christie Christina, the ditzy co-host of E. Buzz Miller (Dan Aykroyd)&#x27;s public-access television cable TV show. Using her own name, Newman also played a TV news reporter for &quot;Weekend Update&quot; when the segment was hosted by Chevy Chase (1975–1976) and Jane Curtin (1976–1980). Newman generally decided not to repeat her characters, and so has far fewer signature characters than some of her fellow cast members.

Newman states when asked about her favorite &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; character: &quot;My favorite character ... which, I think, only pleased me and no one else, was Lina Wertmüller (based on the actual Lina Wertmüller).&quot;

==Later life and career==
Newman&#x27;s post-&quot;SNL&quot; film career has been in both leading and supporting roles, as well as a voice artist in television and features.

In her memoirs, Newman recounted dating Dan Aykroyd, Warren Zevon, Peter Cook, Phil Hartman, and P.J. O&#x27;Rourke. She was also in a relationship with Mark Mothersbaugh of the new wave band Devo years after the band did a guest spot in the fourth season of &quot;SNL&quot;. Newman and Mothersbaugh were together for a couple for years, during which time Newman played Donut Rooter in the band&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;re All Devo&quot; VHS release (1984). In her memoirs, Newman claimed she was celibate for four years after the end of her relationship with Mothersbaugh.

===1970s===
Prior to leaving &quot;SNL&quot;, Newman appeared in &quot;American Hot Wax&quot; (1978) and did a cameo in &quot;Mr. Mike&#x27;s Mondo Video&quot; (1979).

===1980s===
Newman continued to appear in film and television productions during the 1980s. Among these were &quot;Wholly Moses&quot;, &quot;Voltar The Invincible&quot;, &quot;Perfect&quot;, and &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot;. She also had a small role in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; (1980). In 1986 she starred in the syndicated B-movie comedy series, &quot;The Canned Film Festival&quot;, playing the lead role as Laraine the usherette. Additionally, she made appearances on &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, &quot;E.T. and Friends&quot; (1983) (in which she reprised her role as Connie Conehead), &quot;Steve Martin&#x27;s Best Show Ever&quot; (1981), &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, and &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. Newman auditioned for the role of Masha in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; (1983); the role was played in the film by Sandra Bernhard. By her own admission, Newman&#x27;s career during this period languished as she struggled with depression and chemical dependency issues. She became sober in 1987, after 21 years of drug use.

Newman celebrated her 36th birthday in March 1988 with a party in Los Angeles that was the last time Gilda Radner was with her original &quot;SNL&quot; co-stars. According to Bill Murray, when he heard Radner was about to leave the party, he and Dan Aykroyd carried her around the Los Angeles house where the party was held so that she could say goodbye to everyone. Radner died on May 20, 1989.

===1990s===
Newman played the antagonist in &quot;Problem Child 2&quot; (1991) and also appeared in 1993&#x27;s &quot;Coneheads&quot; (in which Michelle Burke played Connie Conehead, the character Newman originated on &quot;SNL&quot;, while Newman appeared in a minor role as Connie&#x27;s aunt Laarta). She appeared in episodes of &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot;, &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, and in the 1994 film &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. She also started to focus on voice acting, on &quot;The Tick&quot;, &quot;Histeria!&quot;, &quot;CatDog&quot;, and &quot;Rugrats&quot; (in &quot;All Growed Up&quot;, an episode which would form the basis of the spinoff &quot;All Grown Up!&quot;, for which she also provided voice work).

===2000s===
In the 2000s Newman lent her voice to animated movie and TV characters in &quot;Danny Phantom&quot;, &quot;As Told By Ginger&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Metalocalypse&quot; and &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot;. She provided voice work for &quot;WALL-E&quot;, &quot;Battle for Terra&quot;, &quot;Ponyo&quot;, &quot;Jungle Junction&quot;, &quot;Cars&quot;, &quot;Up!&quot;, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Barnyard&quot;, &quot;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs&quot;, &quot;Happily N&#x27;Ever After&quot;, and &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot;.

Newman also appeared in episodes of &quot;Entourage&quot;, &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, &quot;According to Jim&quot;, and &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;.

===2010s===
Newman provided her voice in &quot;Dr. Seuss&#x27; The Lorax&quot; and &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;, and made guest voice appearances in &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; (as Plankton&#x27;s grandmother), &quot;Doc McStuffins&quot;, and &quot;Harvey Street Kids&quot;. She voiced Queen Jipjorrulac, the mother of Mark Chang, in &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, and the Wicked Witch of the West in &quot;Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz&quot;, an animated direct-to-DVD film set during the events of the original 1939 film.

On July 9, 2014, she appeared on Ken Reid&#x27;s &quot;TV Guidance Counselor&quot; podcast.

In 2017, the original cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (including Newman) was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame.

=== 2020s ===
In 2025, she made a guest appearance during the Saturday Night Live 50th Anniversary Special where she reminiscences about her memories in Studio 8H and tries to share them with a stagehand named Chad (Pete Davidson).

===Writing===
Newman also works as a writer and editor. She is a contributing editor for the online magazine &quot;One For The Table&quot;, and she is an occasional contributor to the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;. She has contributed articles for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Believer&quot;, and &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s&quot;. She wrote the foreword to the book version of the UCB Production &quot;Worst Laid Plans&quot;. In March 2021, she published her audio memoir &quot;May You Live in Interesting Times&quot; on Audible.

<text>Scouting in Alaska has a long history, from the 1920s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live. Alaska shares a communal Scout history, only being broken into smaller councils in the 1960s.

==Early history (1920s-1950)==
Scouting came to Alaska in the 1920s, and the &quot;Alaska Territorial Council&quot; was created in the 1930s.

==Recent history (1950–1990)==
== Boy Scouting in Alaska today==
There are two Boy Scouts of America local councils in Alaska.

===Great Alaska Council===
The &quot;Western Alaska Council&quot; and &quot;Southeast Alaska Council&quot; merged to form the Great Alaska Council in January, 2006. The combined &quot;Supercouncil&quot; has 3,000 volunteers serving 16,000 youth. The Western Alaska Council was formed in 1954 from a part of the Seattle Council, which had absorbed the Alaska Council in 1954.

Scouts in the Russian oblast of Magadan have a relationship with the Great Alaska Council.

====Organization====
*Bear Paw District (serves the Matanuska-Susitna Borough and Valdez)
*Denali District (serves Southern Anchorage and Girdwood)
*Eklutna District (serves Northern Anchorage, Chugiak and Eagle River)
*Maritime District (formerly of Southeast Alaska Council, serves Juneau, Haines, Sitka and Skagway)
*Totem District (formerly of Southeast Alaska Council, serves Petersburg, Wrangell, Ketchikan, Prince of Wales Island, and environs)
*Tustumena District (serves Kenai Peninsula, Cordova, Kodiak, and Western Alaska)

====Order of the Arow====
Nanuk Lodge was created in 1947, and celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2022. Nanuk Lodge #355 was established July 1, 1947, with the inception of the Alaska Council of the Boy Scouts of America, based out of the State Capital of Juneau. Initially the Council was responsible for the entire State of Alaska. Nanuk Lodge #355 absorbed Kootz Lodge #523 when Western Alaska Council merged with Southeast Alaska Council.

The Lodge Totem is the great Alaskan Polar Bear, which the Inuit people call “Nanook”, the lodge name is a variation of that name. By 1957, scouting was developed enough in the Anchorage area to support a new council. The Western Alaska Area Council was formed on July 1, 1955 and retained the original lodge name. Southeast Alaska formed a new lodge, named Kootz, which merged into Nanuk Lodge in 2006, thus becoming the lodge of the Great Alaska Council. Nanuk Lodge is responsible for OA programs across 297,833 square miles, covering the Aleutian Islands, Western Alaska Coast, South-Central Alaska, and the Pan-Handle to the South-East.

===Midnight Sun Council===
The Midnight Sun Council serves interior and northern Alaska, and is headquartered in Fairbanks.

====Organization====
*Tanana Valley District
*Bush District

====Camps====
*Lost Lake Scout Camp
*Northern Lights High Adventure

====Order of the Arrow====
Toontuk Lodge #549 was founded in 1961. The lodge is named after the barren ground caribou, which is known to the Yupik Eskimo people of Western Alaska as Toontuk. Toontuk Lodge was recognized with the National Service Grant in 1997. The money was used to rehabilitate the waterfront at Lost Lake Scout Camp with sand and a lifeguard tower. In 2006, Toontuk Lodge celebrated its 45th anniversary. Among its projects that year, the Lodge gave the Council a large amphitheater sited on Lost Lake at Lost Lake Camp.

==Girl Scouting in Alaska ==

As of October 2009 two Girl Scout councils exist in Alaska.

===Farthest North Girl Scout Council===
The Farthest North Girl Scout Council serves the largest geographical area of any of the more than 100 Girl Scout Councils in the United States, serving everything from the 63rd parallel north of the Alaska Range, more than .

This council was started in 1925 by a handful of girls in Fairbanks, Alaska headed by Jessie Bloom. Girl Scouting expanded to rural Alaska in 1945 with the establishment of the first troop in Nome. Since English was not the predominantly spoken language, they learned the Girl Scout Promise in Yup&#x27;ik and English.

===Girl Scouts of Alaska===

Girl Scouts of Alaska was formed on October 1, 2009 by the merger of Girl Scouts Susitna Council and Tongass Alaska Girl Scout Council and serves all of Alaska, south of the 63 parallel. Girl Scouts of Alaska is the proven leadership development program for girls in grades K-12. Girl Scouts provides a safe, inclusive environment for Alaska’s diverse population of girls, regardless of income or socioeconomic background. With the help of adult volunteers, Girl Scouts of Alaska (GSAK) serves girls from Bethel to Ketchikan. GSAK is headquartered in Anchorage, with a field office in Juneau.

====Camps====
Camp Togowoods in Wasilla and Camp Singing Hills in Peters Creek.

<text>Roger Wolcott Sperry (August 20, 1913 – April 17, 1994) was an American neuropsychologist, neurobiologist, cognitive neuroscientist, and Nobel laureate who, together with David Hunter Hubel and Torsten Nils Wiesel, won the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for his work with split-brain research. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Sperry as the 44th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

==Early life and education==
Sperry was born in Hartford, Connecticut, to Francis Bushnell and Florence Kraemer Sperry. His father was in banking, and his mother trained in business school. He was raised in an upper middle-class environment, which stressed academic achievement. Roger had one brother, Russell Loomis. Their father died when Roger was 11. Afterwards, his mother became assistant to the principal in the local high school.

Sperry went to Hall High School in West Hartford, Connecticut, where he was a star athlete in several sports, and did well enough academically to win a scholarship to Oberlin College. At Oberlin, he was captain of the basketball team, and he also took part in varsity baseball, football, and track. He also worked at a cafe on campus to help support himself. Sperry was an English major, but he took an Intro to Psychology class taught by a Professor named R. H. Stetson who had worked with William James, the father of American Psychology. This class sparked Sperry&#x27;s interest in the brain and how it can change. Stetson was disabled and had trouble getting around so Sperry would help him out by driving him to and from wherever he needed to go. This included taking Stetson to lunch with his colleagues. Sperry would just sit at the end of the table and listen to Stetson and his colleagues discuss their research and other psychological interests. This increased Sperry&#x27;s interest in Psychology even more and after he received his undergraduate degree in English from Oberlin he decided to stay and get his master&#x27;s degree in Psychology. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in English in 1935 and a master&#x27;s degree in psychology in 1937. He received his Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Chicago in 1941, supervised by Paul A. Weiss. Sperry then did postdoctoral research with Karl Lashley at Harvard University though most of his time was spent with Lashley at the Yerkes Primate Research Center in Orange Park, Florida.

==Career==
In 1942, Sperry began work at the Yerkes Laboratories of Primate Biology, then a part of Harvard University. There he focused on experiments involving the rearranging of motor and sensory nerves. He left in 1946 to become an assistant professor, and later associate professor, at the University of Chicago. In 1949, during a routine chest x-ray, there was evidence of tuberculosis. He was sent to Saranac Lake in the Adironack Mountains in New York for treatment. It was during this time that he began writing his concepts of the mind and brain, which were first published in the &quot;American Scientist&quot; in 1952. In 1952, he became the Section Chief of Neurological Diseases and Blindness at the National Institutes of Health and finished out the year at the Marine Biology Laboratory in Coral Gables, Florida. Sperry went back to The University of Chicago in 1952 and became an Associate Professor of Psychology. He was not offered tenure at Chicago and planned to move to Bethesda, Maryland but was held up by a delay in construction at the National Institutes of Health. During this time Sperry&#x27;s friend Victor Hepburn invited him to lecture about his research at a symposium. There were professors from the California Institute of Technology in the audience of the symposium who, after listening to Sperry&#x27;s lecture, were so impressed with him that they offered him a job as the Hixson Professor of Psychobiology. In 1954, he accepted the position of professor at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech as Hixson Professor of Psychobiology) where he performed his most famous experiments with Joseph Bogen, MD and many students including Michael Gazzaniga.

Under the supervision of Paul Weiss while earning his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago, Sperry became interested in neuronal specificity and brain circuitry and began questioning the existing concepts about these two topics. He asked the simple question first asked in his Introduction to Psychology class at Oberlin: Nature or nurture? He began a series of experiments in an attempt to answer this question. Sperry crosswired the motor nerves of rats&#x27; legs so the left nerve controlled the right leg and vice versa. He would then place the rats in a cage that had an electric grid on the bottom separated into four sections. Each leg of the rat was placed into one of the four sections of the electric grid. A shock was administered to a specific section of the grid, for example the grid where the rat&#x27;s left back leg was located would receive a shock. Every time the left paw was shocked the rat would lift his right paw and vice versa. Sperry wanted to know how long it would take the rat to realize he was lifting the wrong paw. After repeated tests Sperry found that the rats never learned to lift up the correct paw, leading him to the conclusion that some things are just hardwired and cannot be relearned. In Sperry&#x27;s words, &quot;no adaptive functioning of the nervous system took place.&quot; During Sperry&#x27;s postdoctoral years with Karl Lashley at Harvard and at the Yerkes Laboratories of Primate Biology in Orange Park, Florida, he continued his work on neuronal specificity that he had begun as a doctoral student and initiated a new series of studies involving salamanders. The optic nerves were sectioned and the eyes rotated 180 degrees. The question was whether vision would be normal after regeneration or would the animal forever view the world as &quot;upside down&quot; and right-left reversed. Should the latter prove to be the case, it would mean that the nerves were somehow &quot;guided&quot; back to their original sites of termination. Restoration of normal vision (i.e., &quot;seeing&quot; the world in a &quot;right-side-up&quot; orientation) would mean that the regenerating nerves had terminated in new sites, quite different from the original ones. The animals reacted as though the world was upside down and reversed from right to left. Furthermore, no amount of training could change the response. These studies, which provided strong evidence for nerve guidance by &quot;intricate chemical codes under genetic control&quot; (1963) culminated in Sperry&#x27;s chemoaffinity hypothesis (1951).

Sperry later served on the Board of Trustees and as Professor of Psychobiology Emeritus at California Institute of Technology. The Sperry Neuroscience Building at Oberlin College was named in his honor in 1990.

==Nobel Prize==
Sperry was granted numerous awards over his lifetime, including the California Scientist of the Year Award in 1972, the National Medal of Science in 1989, the Wolf Prize in Medicine in 1979, and the Albert Lasker Medical Research Award in 1979, and the Nobel Prize for Medicine/Physiology in 1981 that he shared with David H. Hubel and Torsten N. Wiesel. Sperry won this award for his work with &quot;split-brain&quot; patients. The brain is divided into two hemispheres, the left and right hemispheres, connected in the middle by a part of the brain called the corpus callosum. In &quot;split-brain&quot; patients, the corpus callosum has been severed due to the patients suffering from epilepsy, a disease that causes intense and persistent seizures. Seizures begin in one hemisphere and continue into the other hemisphere. Cutting the corpus callosum prevents the seizures from moving from one hemisphere to the other, which then prevents seizures from occurring, thus allowing the patients to function normally instead of suffering from continuous seizures.

Sperry first became interested in &quot;split-brain&quot; research when he was working on the topic of interocular transfer, which occurs when &quot;one learns with one eye how to solve a problem then, with that eye covered and using the other eye, one already knows how to solve the problem&quot;. Sperry asked the question: &quot;how can the learning with one eye appear with the use of the other?&quot; Sperry cut nerves in the eyes of cats so the left eye was connected to the left hemisphere and the right eye was connected to the right hemisphere; he also cut the corpus callosum. The cats were then taught to distinguish a triangle from a square with the right eye covered. Then the cats were presented the same problem with the left eye covered; the cats had no idea what they had just learned with the right eye and because of this could be taught to distinguish a square from a triangle. Depending on which eye was covered, the cats would either distinguish a square from a triangle or a triangle from a square, demonstrating that the left and right hemispheres learned and remembered two different events. This led Sperry to believe that the left and right hemispheres function separately when not connected by the corpus callosum.

Sperry&#x27;s research with &quot;split-brain&quot; cats helped lead to the discovery that cutting the corpus callosum is a very effective treatment for patients who suffer from epilepsy. Initially after the patients recovered from surgery there were no signs that the surgery caused any changes to their behavior or functioning. This observation rendered the question: if the surgery had absolutely no effect on any part of the patients&#x27; normal functioning then what is the purpose of the corpus callosum? Was it simply there to keep the two sides of the brain from collapsing, as Karl Lashley jokingly put it? Sperry was asked to develop a series of tests to perform on the &quot;split-brain&quot; patients to determine if the surgery caused changes in the patients&#x27; functioning or not.

Working with his graduate student Michael Gazzaniga, Sperry invited several of the &quot;split-brain&quot; patients to volunteer to take part in his study to determine if the surgery affected their functioning. These tests were designed to test the patients&#x27; language, vision, and motor skills. When a person views something in the left visual field (that is on the left side of their body), the information travels to the right hemisphere of the brain and vice versa. In the first series of tests, Sperry would present a word to either the left or right visual field for a short period of time. If the word was shown to the right visual field, meaning the left hemisphere would process it, then the patient could report seeing the word. If the word was shown to the left visual field, meaning the right hemisphere would process it, then the patient could not report seeing the word. This led Sperry to believe that only the left side of the brain could articulate speech. However, in a follow-up experiment, Sperry discovered that the right hemisphere does have some language abilities. In this experiment, he had the patients place their left hands in a tray full of objects located under a partition so the patient would not be able to see the objects. Then a word was shown to the patient&#x27;s left visual field, which was processed by the right side of the brain. This word described one of the objects in the tray, so the patient&#x27;s left hand picked up the object corresponding to the word. When participants were asked about the word and the object in their hand, they claimed they had not seen the word and had no idea why they were holding the object. The right side of the brain had recognized the word and told the left hand to pick it up, but because the right side of the brain cannot speak and the left side of the brain had not seen the word, the patient could not articulate what they had seen.

In another series of experiments further examining the lateralization of language in the left and right hemispheres, Sperry presented one object to the left visual field and a different object to the right visual field of the &quot;split-brain&quot; patients. The patient&#x27;s left hand was put under a partition and then the patient was asked to draw with their left hand what they had been shown. The patients would draw what they had seen in their left visual field, but when asked what they had drawn would describe what had been shown to their right visual field. These tests proved that when the corpus callosum is severed, it breaks the connection between the left and right hemispheres, making them unable to communicate with each other. Not only are they unable to communicate with each other, but also without the corpus callosum connecting them one hemisphere has no idea that the other hemisphere even exists. There was even evidence of this outside the laboratory when some of the patients reported that, &quot;while their left hand was unbuttoning their shirt, the right hand would follow along behind and button it again.&quot; These experiments were beneficial to numerous people in many different ways.

In his words, each hemisphere is:

This research contributed greatly to understanding the lateralization of brain function. In 1989, Sperry also received the National Medal of Science. Afterwards in 1993, Sperry received the Lifetime Achievement Award from APA.

In addition to his contribution in establishing the lateralized function of the brain, Sperry is noted for his &quot;chemoaffinity hypothesis&quot;, which has not only been influential in formation of testable hypotheses in how precise neuronal wiring diagram is established in the brain, but the hypothesis itself has been verified by numerous experiments.

In the words of a 2009 review article in &quot;Science&quot; magazine: &quot;He suggested that gradients of such identification tags on retinal neurons and on the target cells in the brain coordinately guide the orderly projection of millions of developing retinal axons. This idea was supported by the identification and genetic analysis of axon guidance molecules, including those that direct development of the vertebrate visual system.&quot; This was confirmed in the seventies by Marshall W. Nirenberg&#x27;s work on chick retinas and later on &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; larvae.

The experiments conducted by Sperry focused on four major ideas which were also called &quot;turnarounds&quot;: equipotentiality, split brain studies, nerve regeneration and plasticity, and psychology of the consciousness.

==Personal life==
In 1949, Sperry married Norma Gay Deupree. They had one son, Glenn Michael, and one daughter, Janeth Hope. Sperry was a quiet, thoughtful, and modest man with an insatiable curiosity. He never stopped working, questioning, or learning up until his death in 1994 of ALS or Lou Gehrig&#x27;s Disease. Sperry could often be found in his office with his feet propped up on his desk scribbling in his notebook or deep in thought. Sperry was an avid paleontologist and displayed his large fossil collection in his home. He was also a very talented sculptor, artist, and ceramicist. He enjoyed going on camping and fishing trips with his wife and children in Baja, California.

<text>Substance misuse, also known as drug misuse or, in older vernacular, substance abuse, is the use of a drug in amounts or by methods that are harmful to the individual or others. It is a form of substance-related disorder. Differing definitions of drug misuse are used in public health, medical, and criminal justice contexts. In some cases, criminal or anti-social behavior occurs when the person is under the influence of a drug, and long-term personality changes in individuals may also occur. In addition to possible physical, social, and psychological harm, the use of some drugs may also lead to criminal penalties, although these vary widely depending on the local jurisdiction.

Drugs most often associated with this term include alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, methaqualone, and opioids. The exact cause of substance misuse is not clear, but there are two predominant theories: either a genetic predisposition or a habit learned from others, which, if addiction develops, manifests itself as a chronic debilitating disease.
In 2010, about 5% of adults (230 million) used an illicit substance. Of these, 27 million have high-risk drug use—otherwise known as recurrent drug use—causing harm to their health, causing psychological problems, and or causing social problems that put them at risk of those dangers. In 2015, substance use disorders resulted in 307,400 deaths, up from 165,000 deaths in 1990. Of these, the highest numbers are from alcohol use disorders at 137,500, opioid use disorders at 122,100 deaths, amphetamine use disorders at 12,200 deaths, and cocaine use disorders at 11,100.
==Classification==
===Public health definitions===

Public health practitioners have attempted to look at substance use from a broader perspective than the individual, emphasizing the role of society, culture, and availability. Some health professionals choose to avoid the terms alcohol or drug &quot;abuse&quot; in favor of language considered more objective, such as &quot;substance and alcohol type problems&quot; or &quot;harmful/problematic use&quot; of drugs. The Health Officers Council of British Columbia — in their 2005 policy discussion paper, &quot;A Public Health Approach to Drug Control in Canada&quot; — has adopted a public health model of psychoactive substance use that challenges the simplistic black-and-white construction of the binary (or complementary) antonyms &quot;use&quot; vs. &quot;abuse&quot;. This model explicitly recognizes a spectrum of use, ranging from beneficial use to chronic dependence.

===Medical definitions===

&#x27;Drug abuse&#x27; is no longer a current medical diagnosis in either of the most used diagnostic tools in the world, the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), and the World Health Organization&#x27;s International Classification of Diseases (ICD).

===Value judgment===

History professor Philip Jenkins suggests that there are two issues with the term &quot;drug abuse&quot;. First, what constitutes a drug is debatable. For instance, GHB, a naturally occurring substance in the central nervous system is considered a drug, and is illegal in many countries, while nicotine is not officially considered a &quot;drug&quot; in most countries.

Second, the word &quot;abuse&quot; implies a recognized standard of use for any substance. Drinking an occasional glass of wine is considered acceptable in most Western countries, while drinking several bottles is seen as abuse. Strict temperance advocates, who may or may not be religiously motivated, would see drinking even one glass as abuse. Some groups (Mormons, as prescribed in &quot;the Word of Wisdom&quot;) even condemn caffeine use in any quantity. Similarly, adopting the view that any (recreational) use of cannabis or substituted amphetamines constitutes drug abuse implies a decision made that the substance is harmful, even in minute quantities. In the U.S., drugs have been legally classified into five categories, schedule I, II, III, IV, or V in the Controlled Substances Act. The drugs are classified on their deemed potential for abuse. 

The usage of some drugs is strongly correlated. For example, the consumption of seven illicit drugs (amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, legal highs, LSD, and magic mushrooms) is correlated and the Pearson correlation coefficient &quot;r&quot;&gt;0.4 in every pair of them; consumption of cannabis is strongly correlated (&quot;r&quot;&gt;0.5) with the usage of nicotine (tobacco), heroin is correlated with cocaine (&quot;r&quot;&gt;0.4) and methadone (&quot;r&quot;&gt;0.45), and is strongly correlated with crack (&quot;r&quot;&gt;0.5)

===Drug misuse===
Drug misuse is a term used commonly when prescription medication with sedative, anxiolytic, analgesic, or stimulant properties is used for mood alteration or intoxication ignoring the fact that overdose of such medicines can sometimes have serious adverse effects. It sometimes involves drug diversion from the individual for whom it was prescribed.

Prescription misuse has been defined differently and rather inconsistently based on the status of drug prescription, the uses without a prescription, intentional use to achieve intoxicating effects, route of administration, co-ingestion with alcohol, and the presence or absence of dependence symptoms. Chronic use of certain substances leads to a change in the central nervous system known as a &quot;tolerance&quot; to the medicine such that more of the substance is needed in order to produce desired effects. With some substances, stopping or reducing use can cause withdrawal symptoms to occur, but this is highly dependent on the specific substance in question.

The rate of prescription drug misuse is fast overtaking illegal drug use in the United States. According to the National Institute of Drug Abuse, 7 million people were taking prescription drugs for nonmedical use in 2010. Among 12th graders, nonmedical prescription drug use is now second only to cannabis. In 2011, &quot;Nearly 1 in 12 high school seniors reported nonmedical use of Vicodin; 1 in 20 reported such use of OxyContin.&quot; Both of these drugs contain opioids. Fentanyl is an opioid that is 100 times more potent than morphine, and 50 times more potent than heroin. A 2017 survey of 12th graders in the United States, found misuse of OxyContin of 2.7 percent, compared to 5.5 percent at its peak in 2005. Misuse of the combination hydrocodone/paracetamol was at its lowest since a peak of 10.5 percent in 2003. This decrease may be related to public health initiatives and decreased availability.

Avenues of obtaining prescription drugs for misuse are varied: sharing between family and friends, illegally buying medications at school or work, and often &quot;doctor shopping&quot; to find multiple physicians to prescribe the same medication, without the knowledge of other prescribers.

Increasingly, law enforcement is holding physicians responsible for prescribing controlled substances without fully establishing patient controls, such as a patient &quot;drug contract&quot;. Concerned physicians are educating themselves on how to identify medication-seeking behavior in their patients, and are becoming familiar with &quot;red flags&quot; that would alert them to potential prescription drug abuse.

==Signs and symptoms==

Depending on the actual compound, drug abuse including alcohol may lead to health problems, social problems, morbidity, injuries, unprotected sex, violence, deaths, motor vehicle accidents, homicides, suicides, physical dependence or psychological addiction.

There is a high rate of suicide in alcoholics and other drug abusers. The reasons believed to cause the increased risk of suicide include the long-term abuse of alcohol and other drugs causing physiological distortion of brain chemistry as well as the social isolation. Another factor is the acute intoxicating effects of the drugs may make suicide more likely to occur. Suicide is also very common in adolescent alcohol abusers, with 1 in 4 suicides in adolescents being related to alcohol abuse. In the US, approximately 30% of suicides are related to alcohol abuse. Alcohol abuse is also associated with increased risks of committing criminal offences including child abuse, domestic violence, rapes, burglaries and assaults.

Drug abuse, including alcohol and prescription drugs, can induce symptomatology which resembles mental illness. This can occur both in the intoxicated state and also during withdrawal. In some cases, substance-induced psychiatric disorders can persist long after detoxification, such as prolonged psychosis or depression after amphetamine or cocaine abuse. A protracted withdrawal syndrome can also occur with symptoms persisting for months after cessation of use. Benzodiazepines are the most notable drug for inducing prolonged withdrawal effects with symptoms sometimes persisting for years after cessation of use. Both alcohol, barbiturate as well as benzodiazepine withdrawal can potentially be fatal. Abuse of hallucinogens, although extremely unlikely, may in some individuals trigger delusional and other psychotic phenomena long after cessation of use. This is mainly a risk with deliriants, and most unlikely with psychedelics and dissociatives.

Cannabis may trigger panic attacks during intoxication and with continued use, it may cause a state similar to dysthymia. Researchers have found that daily cannabis use and the use of high-potency cannabis are independently associated with a higher chance of developing schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.

Severe anxiety and depression are often induced by sustained alcohol abuse. Even sustained moderate alcohol use may increase anxiety and depression levels in some individuals. In most cases, these drug-induced psychiatric disorders fade away with prolonged abstinence. Similarly, although substance abuse induces many changes to the brain, there is evidence that many of these alterations are reversed following periods of prolonged abstinence.

===Impulsivity===
Impulsivity is characterized by actions based on sudden desires, whims, or inclinations rather than careful thought. Individuals with substance abuse have higher levels of impulsivity, and individuals who use multiple drugs tend to be more impulsive. A number of studies using the Iowa gambling task as a measure for impulsive behavior found that drug using populations made more risky choices compared to healthy controls. There is a hypothesis that the loss of impulse control may be due to impaired inhibitory control resulting from drug induced changes that take place in the frontal cortex. The neurodevelopmental and hormonal changes that happen during adolescence may modulate impulse control that could possibly lead to the experimentation with drugs and may lead to addiction. Impulsivity is thought to be a facet trait in the neuroticism personality domain (overindulgence/negative urgency) which is prospectively associated with the development of substance abuse.
== Screening and assessment ==
The screening and assessment process of substance use behavior is important for the diagnosis and treatment of substance use disorders. &quot;Screeners&quot; is the process of identifying individuals who have or may be at risk for a substance use disorder and are usually brief to administer. &quot;Assessments&quot; are used to clarify the nature of the substance use behavior to help determine appropriate treatment. Assessments usually require specialized skills, and are longer to administer than screeners.

Given that addiction manifests in structural changes to the brain, it is possible that non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging could help diagnose addiction in the future.

=== Targeted assessments ===
There are several different screening tools that have been validated for use with adolescents such as the CRAFFT Screening Test and in adults the CAGE questionnaire. Some recommendations for screening tools for substance misuse in pregnancy include that they take less than 10 minutes, should be used routinely, include an educational component. Tools suitable for pregnant women include i.a. 4Ps, T-ACE, TWEAK, TQDH (Ten-Question Drinking History), and AUDIT.

==Treatment==
===Psychological===
From the applied behavior analysis literature, behavioral psychology, and from randomized clinical trials, several evidenced based interventions have emerged: behavioral marital therapy, motivational Interviewing, community reinforcement approach, exposure therapy, contingency management They help suppress cravings and mental anxiety, improve focus on treatment and new learning behavioral skills, ease withdrawal symptoms and reduce the chances of relapse.

In children and adolescents, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and family therapy currently has the most research evidence for the treatment of substance abuse problems. Well-established studies also include ecological family-based treatment and group CBT. These treatments can be administered in a variety of different formats, each of which has varying levels of research support Research has shown that what makes group CBT most effective is that it promotes the development of social skills, developmentally appropriate emotional regulatory skills and other interpersonal skills. A few integrated treatment models, which combines parts from various types of treatment, have also been seen as both well-established or probably effective. A study on maternal alcohol and other drug use has shown that integrated treatment programs have produced significant results, resulting in higher negative results on toxicology screens. Additionally, brief school-based interventions have been found to be effective in reducing adolescent alcohol and cannabis use and abuse. Motivational interviewing can also be effective in treating substance use disorder in adolescents.

Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous are widely known self-help organizations in which members support each other abstain from substances. Social skills are significantly impaired in people with alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. It has been suggested that social skills training adjunctive to inpatient treatment of alcohol dependence is probably efficacious, including managing the social environment.

===Medication===

A number of medications have been approved for the treatment of substance abuse. These include replacement therapies such as buprenorphine and methadone as well as antagonist medications like disulfiram and naltrexone in either short acting, or the newer long acting form. Several other medications, often ones originally used in other contexts, have also been shown to be effective including bupropion and modafinil. Methadone and buprenorphine are sometimes used to treat opiate addiction. These drugs are used as substitutes for other opioids and still cause withdrawal symptoms but they facilitate the tapering off process in a controlled fashion. When a person goes from using fentanyl every day, to not using it at all, they will experience a point where they need to get used to not using the substance. This is called withdrawal.

Antipsychotic medications have not been found to be useful. Acamprostate is a glutamatergic NMDA antagonist, which helps with alcohol withdrawal symptoms because alcohol withdrawal is associated with a hyperglutamatergic system.

===Heroin-assisted treatment===

Three countries in Europe have active HAT programs, namely England, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Despite critical voices by conservative think-tanks with regard to these harm-reduction strategies, significant progress in the reduction of drug-related deaths has been achieved in those countries. For example, the US, devoid of such measures, has seen large increases in drug-related deaths since 2000 (mostly related to heroin use), while Switzerland has seen large decreases. In 2018, approximately 60,000 people have died of drug overdoses in America, while in the same time period, Switzerland&#x27;s drug deaths were at 260. Relative to the population of these countries, the US has 10 times more drug-related deaths compared to the Swiss Confederation, which in effect illustrates the efficacy of HAT to reduce fatal outcomes in opiate/opioid addiction.

===Dual diagnosis===

It is common for individuals with drugs use disorder to have other psychological problems. The terms &quot;dual diagnosis&quot; or &quot;co-occurring disorders&quot;, refer to having a mental health and substance use disorder at the same time. According to the British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP), &quot;symptoms of psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety and psychosis are the rule rather than the exception in patients misusing drugs and/or alcohol.&quot;

Individuals who have a comorbid psychological disorder often have a poor prognosis if either disorder is untreated. Historically most individuals with dual diagnosis either received treatment only for one of their disorders or they did not receive any treatment all. However, since the 1980s, there has been a push towards integrating mental health and addiction treatment. In this method, neither condition is considered primary and both are treated simultaneously by the same provider.

==Epidemiology==
The initiation of drug use including alcohol is most likely to occur during adolescence, and some experimentation with substances by older adolescents is common. For example, results from 2010 Monitoring the Future survey, a nationwide study on rates of substance use in the United States, show that 48.2% of 12th graders report having used an illicit drug at some point in their lives. In the 30 days prior to the survey, 41.2% of 12th graders had consumed alcohol and 19.2% of 12th graders had smoked tobacco cigarettes. In 2009 in the United States about 21% of high school students have taken prescription drugs without a prescription. And earlier in 2002, the World Health Organization estimated that around 140 million people were alcohol dependent and another 400 million with alcohol-related problems.

Studies have shown that the large majority of adolescents will phase out of drug use before it becomes problematic. Thus, although rates of overall use are high, the percentage of adolescents who meet criteria for substance abuse is significantly lower (close to 5%). According UN estimates, there are &quot;more than 50 million regular users of morphine diacetate (heroin), cocaine and synthetic drugs&quot;.

More than 70,200 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017. Among these, the sharpest increase occurred among deaths related to fentanyl and synthetic opioids (28,466 deaths). See charts below.

==History==

===APA, AMA, and NCDA===

In 1966, the American Medical Association&#x27;s Committee on Alcoholism and Addiction defined abuse of stimulants (amphetamines, primarily) in terms of &#x27;medical supervision&#x27;:
In 1972, the American Psychiatric Association created a definition that used legality, social acceptability, and cultural familiarity as qualifying factors:
In 1973, the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse stated:
...drug abuse may refer to any type of drug or chemical without regard to its pharmacologic actions. It is an eclectic concept having only one uniform connotation: societal disapproval. ... The Commission believes that the term drug abuse must be deleted from official pronouncements and public policy dialogue. The term has no functional utility and has become no more than an arbitrary codeword for that drug use which is presently considered wrong.

===DSM===
The first edition of the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (published in 1952) grouped alcohol and other drug abuse under &quot;sociopathic personality disturbances&quot;, which were thought to be symptoms of deeper psychological disorders or moral weakness. The third edition, published in 1980, was the first to recognize substance abuse (including drug abuse) and substance dependence as conditions separate from substance abuse alone, bringing in social and cultural factors. The definition of dependence emphasised tolerance to drugs, and withdrawal from them as key components to diagnosis, whereas abuse was defined as &quot;problematic use with social or occupational impairment&quot; but without withdrawal or tolerance.

In 1987, the DSM-IIIR category &quot;psychoactive substance abuse&quot;, which includes former concepts of drug abuse is defined as &quot;a maladaptive pattern of use indicated by...continued use despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent social, occupational, psychological or physical problem that is caused or exacerbated by the use (or by) recurrent use in situations in which it is physically hazardous&quot;. It is a residual category, with dependence taking precedence when applicable. It was the first definition to give equal weight to behavioural and physiological factors in diagnosis. By 1988, the DSM-IV defined substance dependence as &quot;a syndrome involving compulsive use, with or without tolerance and withdrawal&quot;; whereas substance abuse is &quot;problematic use without compulsive use, significant tolerance, or withdrawal&quot;. Substance abuse can be harmful to health and may even be deadly in certain scenarios. By 1994, the fourth edition of the DSM issued by the American Psychiatric Association, the DSM-IV-TR, defined substance dependence as &quot;when an individual persists in use of alcohol or other drugs despite problems related to use of the substance, substance dependence may be diagnosed&quot;, along with criteria for the diagnosis.

The DSM-IV-TR defines substance abuse as:

:*A. A maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by one (or more) of the following, occurring within a 12-month period:
::*Recurrent substance use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., repeated absences or poor work performance related to substance use; substance-related absences, suspensions or expulsions from school; neglect of children or household)
::*Recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically hazardous (e.g., driving an automobile or operating a machine when impaired by substance use)
::*Recurrent substance-related legal problems (e.g., arrests for substance-related disorderly conduct)
::*Continued substance use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the substance (e.g., arguments with spouse about consequences of intoxication, physical fights)
:** the symptoms have never met the criteria for substance dependence for this class of substance

The fifth edition of the DSM (DSM-5), was released in 2013, and it revisited this terminology. The principal change was a transition from the abuse-dependence terminology. In the DSM-IV era, abuse was seen as an early form or less hazardous form of the disease characterized with the dependence criteria. However, the APA&#x27;s &quot;dependence&quot; term does not mean that physiologic dependence is present but rather means that a disease state is present, one that most would likely refer to as an addicted state. Many involved recognize that the terminology has often led to confusion, both within the medical community and with the general public. The American Psychiatric Association requested input as to how the terminology of this illness should be altered as it moves forward with DSM-5 discussions. In the DSM-5, substance abuse and substance dependence have been merged into the category of substance use disorders and they no longer exist as individual concepts. While substance abuse and dependence were either present or not, substance use disorder has three levels of severity: mild, moderate and severe.

==Society and culture==

===Legal approaches===
:&quot;Related articles: Drug control law, Prohibition (drugs), Arguments for and against drug prohibition, Harm reduction&quot;

Most governments have designed legislation to criminalize certain types of drug use. These drugs are often called &quot;illegal drugs&quot; but generally what is illegal is their unlicensed production, distribution, and possession. These drugs are also called &quot;controlled substances&quot;. Even for simple possession, legal punishment can be quite severe (including the death penalty in some countries). Laws vary across countries, and even within them, and have fluctuated widely throughout history.
Attempts by government-sponsored drug control policy to interdict drug supply and eliminate drug abuse have been largely unsuccessful. In spite of the huge efforts by the U.S., drug supply and purity has reached an all-time high, with the vast majority of resources spent on interdiction and law enforcement instead of public health. In the United States, the number of nonviolent drug offenders in prison exceeds by 100,000 the total incarcerated population in the EU, despite the fact that the EU has 100 million more citizens.

Despite drug legislation (or perhaps because of it), large, organized criminal drug cartels operate worldwide. Advocates of decriminalization argue that drug prohibition makes drug dealing a lucrative business, leading to much of the associated criminal activity.

Some states in the U.S., as of late, have focused on facilitating safe use as opposed to eradicating it. For example, as of 2022, New Jersey has made the effort to expand needle exchange programs throughout the state, passing a bill through legislature that gives control over decisions regarding these types of programs to the state&#x27;s department of health. This state level bill is not only significant for New Jersey, as it could be used as a model for other states to possibly follow as well. This bill is partly a reaction to the issues occurring at local level city governments within the state of New Jersey as of late. One example of this is in the Atlantic City Government which came under lawsuit after they halted the enactment of said programs within their city. This suit came a year before the passing of this bill, stemming from a local level decision to shut down related operations in Atlantic City made in July that same year. This lawsuit highlights the feelings of New Jersey residents, who had a great influence on this bill passing the legislature. These feelings were demonstrated in front of Atlantic City City hall, where residents exclaimed their desire for these programs. All in all, the aforementioned bill was signed effectively into law just days after it passed legislature, by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy.

===Cost===

Policymakers try to understand the relative costs of drug-related interventions. An appropriate drug policy relies on the assessment of drug-related public expenditure based on a classification system where costs are properly identified.

Labelled drug-related expenditures are defined as the direct planned spending that reflects the voluntary engagement of the state in the field of illicit drugs. Direct public expenditures explicitly labeled as drug-related can be easily traced back by exhaustively reviewing official accountancy documents such as national budgets and year-end reports. Unlabelled expenditure refers to unplanned spending and is estimated through modeling techniques, based on a top-down budgetary procedure. Starting from overall aggregated expenditures, this procedure estimates the proportion causally attributable to substance abuse (Unlabelled Drug-related Expenditure = Overall Expenditure × Attributable Proportion). For example, to estimate the prison drug-related expenditures in a given country, two elements would be necessary: the overall prison expenditures in the country for a given period, and the attributable proportion of inmates due to drug-related issues. The product of the two will give a rough estimate that can be compared across different countries.

====Europe====

As part of the reporting exercise corresponding to 2005, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction&#x27;s network of national focal points set up in the 27 European Union (EU) the member states, Norway, and the candidates&#x27; countries to the EU, were requested to identify labeled drug-related public expenditure, at the national level.

This was reported by 10 countries categorized according to the functions of government, amounting to a total of EUR 2.17 billion. Overall, the highest proportion of this total came within the government functions of health (66%) (e.g. medical services), and public order and safety (POS) (20%) (e.g. police services, law courts, prisons). By country, the average share of GDP was 0.023% for health, and 0.013% for POS. However, these shares varied considerably across countries, ranging from 0.00033% in Slovakia, up to 0.053% of GDP in Ireland in the case of health, and from 0.003% in Portugal, to 0.02% in the UK, in the case of POS; almost a 161-fold difference between the highest and the lowest countries for health, and a six-fold difference for POS.

To respond to these findings and to make a comprehensive assessment of drug-related public expenditure across countries, this study compared health and POS spending and GDP in the 10 reporting countries. Results suggest GDP to be a major determinant of the health and POS drug-related public expenditures of a country. Labeled drug-related public expenditure showed a positive association with the GDP across the countries considered: r = 0.81 in the case of health, and r = 0.91 for POS. The percentage change in health and POS expenditures due to a one percent increase in GDP (the income elasticity of demand) was estimated to be 1.78% and 1.23% respectively.

Being highly income elastic, health and POS expenditures can be considered luxury goods; as a nation becomes wealthier it openly spends proportionately more on drug-related health and public order and safety interventions.

====United Kingdom====
The UK Home Office estimated that the social and economic cost of drug abuse to the UK economy in terms of crime, absenteeism and sickness is in excess of £20 billion a year.
However, the UK Home Office does not estimate what portion of those crimes are unintended consequences of drug prohibition (crimes to sustain expensive drug consumption, risky production and dangerous distribution), nor what is the cost of enforcement. Those aspects are necessary for a full analysis of the economics of prohibition.

====United States====
These figures represent overall economic costs, which can be divided in three major components: health costs, productivity losses and non-health direct expenditures.

*Health-related costs were projected to total $16 billion in 2002.
*Productivity losses were estimated at $128.6 billion. In contrast to the other costs of drug abuse (which involve direct expenditures for goods and services), this value reflects a loss of potential resources: work in the labor market and in household production that was never performed, but could reasonably be expected to have been performed absent the impact of drug abuse.
:Included are estimated productivity losses due to premature death ($24.6 billion), drug abuse-related illness ($33.4 billion), incarceration ($39.0 billion), crime careers ($27.6 billion) and productivity losses of victims of crime ($1.8 billion).
*The non-health direct expenditures primarily concern costs associated with the criminal justice system and crime victim costs, but also include a modest level of expenses for administration of the social welfare system. The total for 2002 was estimated at $36.4 billion. The largest detailed component of these costs is for state and federal corrections at $14.2 billion, which is primarily for the operation of prisons. Another $9.8 billion was spent on state and local police protection, followed by $6.2 billion for federal supply reduction initiatives.

According to a report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Medicaid was billed for a significantly higher number of hospitals stays for opioid drug overuse than Medicare or private insurance in 1993. By 2012, the differences were diminished. Over the same time, Medicare had the most rapid growth in number of hospital stays.

Canada

Substance abuse takes a financial toll on Canada&#x27;s hospitals and the country as a whole. In the year 2011, around $267 million of hospital services were attributed to dealing with substance abuse problems. The majority of these hospital costs in 2011 were related to issues with alcohol. Additionally, in 2014, Canada also allocated almost $45 million towards battling prescription drug abuse, extending into the year 2019. Most of the financial decisions made on substance abuse in Canada can be attributed to the research conducted by the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse (CCSA) which conduct both extensive and specific reports. In fact, the CCSA is heavily responsible for identifying Canada&#x27;s heavy issues with substance abuse. Some examples of reports by the CCSA include a 2013 report on drug use during pregnancy and a 2015 report on adolescents&#x27; use of cannabis.

==Special populations==

===Immigrants and refugees===

Immigrant and refugees have often been under great stress, physical trauma and depression and anxiety due to separation from loved ones often characterize the pre-migration and transit phases, followed by &quot;cultural dissonance&quot;, language barriers, racism, discrimination, economic adversity, overcrowding, social isolation, and loss of status and difficulty obtaining work and fears of deportation are common. Refugees frequently experience concerns about the health and safety of loved ones left behind and uncertainty regarding the possibility of returning to their country of origin. For some, substance abuse functions as a coping mechanism to attempt to deal with these stressors.

Immigrants and refugees may bring the substance use and abuse patterns and behaviors of their country of origin, or adopt the attitudes, behaviors, and norms regarding substance use and abuse that exist within the dominant culture into which they are entering.

===Street children===
Street children in many developing countries are a high-risk group for substance misuse, in particular solvent abuse. Drawing on research in Kenya, Cottrell-Boyce argues that &quot;drug use amongst street children is primarily functional—dulling the senses against the hardships of life on the street—but can also provide a link to the support structure of the &#x27;street family&#x27; peer group as a potent symbol of shared experience.&quot;

===Musicians===
In order to maintain high-quality performance, some musicians take chemical substances. Some musicians take drugs such as alcohol to deal with the stress of performing. As a group they have a higher rate of substance abuse. The most common chemical substance which is abused by pop musicians is cocaine, because of its neurological effects. Stimulants like cocaine increase alertness and cause feelings of euphoria, and can therefore make the performer feel as though they in some ways &#x27;own the stage&#x27;. One way in which substance abuse is harmful for a performer (musicians especially) is if the substance being abused is aspirated. The lungs are an important organ used by singers, and addiction to cigarettes may seriously harm the quality of their performance. Smoking harms the alveoli, which are responsible for absorbing oxygen.

=== Veterans ===
Substance abuse can be a factor that affects the physical and mental health of veterans. Substance abuse may also harm personal and familial relationships, leading to financial difficulty. There is evidence to suggest that substance abuse disproportionately affects the homeless veteran population. A 2015 Florida study, which compared causes of homelessness between veterans and non-veteran populations in a self-reporting questionnaire, found that 17.8% of the homeless veteran participants attributed their homelessness to alcohol and other drug-related problems compared to just 3.7% of the non-veteran homeless group.

A 2003 study found that homelessness was correlated with access to support from family/friends and services. However, this correlation was not true when comparing homeless participants who had a current substance-use disorders. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs provides a summary of treatment options for veterans with substance-use disorder. For treatments that do not involve medication, they offer therapeutic options that focus on finding outside support groups and &quot;looking at how substance use problems may relate to other problems such as PTSD and depression&quot;.

=== Sex and gender ===
There are many sex differences in substance abuse. Men and women express differences in the short- and long-term effects of substance abuse. These differences can be credited to sexual dimorphisms in the brain, endocrine and metabolic systems. Social and environmental factors that tend to disproportionately affect women, such as child and elder care and the risk of exposure to violence, are also factors in the gender differences in substance abuse. Women report having greater impairment in areas such as employment, family and social functioning when abusing substances but have a similar response to treatment. Co-occurring psychiatric disorders are more common among women than men who abuse substances; women more frequently use substances to reduce the negative effects of these co-occurring disorders. Substance abuse puts both men and women at higher risk for perpetration and victimization of sexual violence. Men tend to take drugs for the first time to be part of a group and fit in more so than women. At first interaction, women may experience more pleasure from drugs than men do. Women tend to progress more rapidly from first experience to addiction than men. Physicians, psychiatrists and social workers have believed for decades that women escalate alcohol use more rapidly once they start. Once the addictive behavior is established for women they stabilize at higher doses of drugs than males do. When withdrawing from smoking women experience greater stress response. Males experience greater symptoms when withdrawing from alcohol. There are gender differences when it comes to rehabilitation and relapse rates. For alcohol, relapse rates were very similar for men and women. For women, marriage and marital stress were risk factors for alcohol relapse. For men, being married lowered the risk of relapse. This difference may be a result of gendered differences in excessive drinking. Alcoholic women are much more likely to be married to partners that drink excessively than are alcoholic men. As a result of this, men may be protected from relapse by marriage while women are at higher risk when married. However, women are less likely than men to experience relapse to substance use. When men experience a relapse to substance use, they more than likely had a positive experience prior to the relapse. On the other hand, when women relapse to substance use, they were more than likely affected by negative circumstances or interpersonal problems.

People overdose drugs to try to forget their problems at home, and some use them for fun because they saw people using drugs at television advertising them.

<text>Scouting in Arizona has a history starting from the 1910s to the present day, serving youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live.

==Early history==

Boy Scouting was founded by Robert Baden-Powell in England and co-founded by the American Scout Major Frederick Russell Burnham. Boy Scouting was brought to the United States by William D. Boyce. He incorporated the Boy Scouts of America on February 8, 1910. The Boy Scouts of America was chartered by Congress on June 15, 1916. This is the same year as the first Boy Scout Council in Arizona was formed with the Prescott Council. Burnham served as the Honorary President of the Arizona Boy Scouts throughout the 1940s until his death in 1947.

The first two Boy Scout troops in Arizona Territory were organized in Prescott, in September 1910 and in Tombstone at almost the same time. In Prescott, E.P. Cole of Whipple Barracks was the first Scoutmaster. Arizona Territorial Historian Sharlot Hall was an honorary member of the Tombstone troop. Scouting came to Phoenix in the fall 1910 with Clarence R. Craig as the Scoutmaster. Other Scout troops were formed; in Bisbee in early 1911. and in St. Joseph and Snowflake about the same time.

Harold Steele, principal of the then new Tucson High School, organized the first Scout troop in Tucson on April 20, 1911.

On November 29, 1911 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) organized the MIA Scouts along the lines recommended by the Boy Scouts of America as part of their Mutual Improvement Association youth program. In March 1912, the LDS Church published their first lessons for the MIA Scouts in the &quot;Improvement Era&quot;. On May 21, 1913, the LDS Church was invited by the Boy Scout National Council to become the first Chartered Sponsored Organization in their movement. The Boy Scouts of America program was then adopted in all LDS Church congregations as part of their youth program. Each LDS Church congregation in Arizona organized a Scout troop.

In April 1921 the eight LDS troops in the Maricopa (LDS) Stake and the Methodist troop met in at the Coffee Cup in Mesa to organize the Apache Council. This was the second council in Arizona. George A. Johnson was the first Council President. Edwin M. LeBaron was the first Field Commissioner. Their first summer camp was held on Sycamore Creek near Payson, Arizona.

On September 16, 1921, the board of the Apache Council met with Scouters from Phoenix at the Tempe National Bank to reorganized into the Roosevelt Council, to be headquartered in Phoenix. Tim Murray from Galveston Texas, was the first professional Scout Executive. The 1922 summer camp was at Pineair (now call Reavis Ranch located in the Superstition Wilderness Area about east of Mesa). The name, Camp Geronimo, is still used by the Grand Canyon Council camp although the location has changed several times. Throughout the 1940s, Frederick Russell Burnham served as the Honorary President of the Roosevelt Council Boy Scouts.

The Roosevelt Council changed its name to the Theodore Roosevelt Council. In 1993 the Theodore Roosevelt Council (located in Phoenix) and the Grand Canyon Council (located in Flagstaff) merged with the Phoenix council assuming the current name, the Grand Canyon Council. The Nassau County Council in New York was renamed to the Theodore Roosevelt Council in 1997.

===Campaign to Save the Bighorn Sheep===
In 1936, Boy Scouts in Arizona mounted a statewide campaign to save the Bighorn Sheep. The Scouts first became interested in the sheep through the efforts of Major Frederick Russell Burnham. Burnham observed that fewer than 150 of these sheep still lived in the Arizona mountains. He called George F. Miller, then Scout Executive of the Phoenix Scout Council, with a plan to save the sheep. Burnham said, 

Several other prominent Arizonans join the movement and a &quot;save the bighorns&quot; poster contest was started in schools throughout the state. Burnham provided prizes and appeared in store windows across Arizona. The contest-winning bighorn emblem was made up into neckerchief slides for the 10,000 Boy Scouts, and talks and dramatizations were given at school assemblies and on radio. The National Wildlife Federation, the Izaak Walton League, and the Audubon Society also joined the effort.

These efforts led to the establishment of two bighorn game ranges in Arizona: Kofa National Wildlife Refuge and Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge. On January 18, 1939, over were set aside and a civilian conservation corp side camp was set up to develop high mountain waterholes for the sheep. The Desert Bighorn Sheep is now the official mascot for Arizona Boy Scouts.
==Today==
There are two Boy Scouts of America (BSA) local councils in Arizona, and other multi-state councils that serve portions of Arizona:

===Catalina Council===

Catalina Council, BSA serves the southeastern portion of Arizona, from Ajo, Arizona to the US-Mexico border in the south, and all the way east to the New Mexico border. Catalina Council is headquartered in Tucson, Arizona, has two Districts, and two camps.

In 1920, the Tucson Council (#011) was formed, changing its name to Catalina Council (#011) in 1922. The Cochise County Council (#008), founded in 1922, merged with the Catalina Council in 1963.

====Districts====
The council is divided into districts which serve Scouting units directly.
* Cochise District – Santa Cruz, Cochise, and eastern portion of Pima Counties
* Sky Islands District – Southern Pinal County and western Pima County

====Camps====

* Camp Lawton Scout Camp has been leased from the National Forest Service since 1921 and has been continuously operated by the Catalina Council. It is located in the Santa Catalina mountains outside of Tucson, Arizona.
* Double V Scout Ranch is located on South Kinney Road six miles (10 km) southwest of Tucson, near Tucson Mountain Park&#x27;s Cat Mountain. The ranch was acquired on a long-term lease from the Bureau of Land Management in 1969. It is used for both Cub Scout and Boy Scout camping and events. Improvements include a large stone ramada equipped with picnic tables, restrooms, and water misters for cooling. The ranch also has an Olympic-size swimming pool. A natural formation on the northwest side of adjacent Cat Mountain visible from the ranch is called the &quot;Indian chief&quot; because of its strong resemblance to an Indian&#x27;s profile. Scenes from the 1970s television series &quot;Petrocelli&quot; were filmed at the ranch.
===Grand Canyon Council===

The Grand Canyon Council serves Scouts in Arizona and New Mexico, offering Cub Scouts and Scouts BSA to boys and girls ages 5 through 18. Additionally ages 14 through 21 can be involved with Venturing, a high adventure outdoor program or in &quot;Learning for Life&quot;, a career-based program.

In 1916, the Globe Council was founded, ending in 1919. In 1925, the Verde Council (#0715) was founded. It merged into the Yavapai-Mohave Council in 1927.

In 1921, the Phoenix Council (#010) was founded, changing its name to the Maricopa County Council (#010) in 1923. The Maricopa County council changed its name to the Roosevelt Council in 1924. In 1922, the Yavapai District was founded, changing its name to the Yavapai &amp; Mohave Counties Council (#012) in 1924. In 1926, Yavapai and Mohave Counties changed its name to Yavapai-Mohave Council (#012). In 1922, the Grand Canyon Council was founded. It merged into Yavapai-Mohave in 1929. The combined councils changed their names to the Northern Arizona Council. In 1934, the council was disbanded and service was taken over by Direct Service.

The Three G Council (#009) was formed in 1943, changing its name to the Copper Council in 1962. In 1977, the Copper Council merged into the Theodore Roosevelt Council (#010). In 1993, the Theodore Roosevelt Council reformed into Grand Canyon Council (#010). Note that this is unrelated to Theodore Roosevelt Council (#386), previously known as Nassau County Council, located in New York. That Council took their current name in 1997.

====Organization====
In 2017, Grand Canyon Council underwent a realignment, reducing the number of districts to six Community Districts.
Districts are:

====Camps====
* Camp Raymond is located outside of Flagstaff, Arizona, between the Kaibab National Forest and the Coconino National Forest, along the rim of Sycamore Canyon. Camp Raymond has 18 campsites and offers a variety of program areas, including Boy Scout Resident Camp during the summer, with 9 program areas and 31 merit badges. For older Scouts, Camp Raymond offers C.O.P.E, Climbing, and Mountain Biking. The camp is named after Dr. R.O. Raymond, one of the first doctors in Flagstaff, Arizona, and the founder of the Raymond Educational Foundation. Dr. Raymond, along with many other community leaders, had the idea to create a permanent summer camp in northern Arizona. The site was purchased in April 1964 for $200 an acre. A Camp Development Committee was formed under the leadership of William Preston as soon as the purchase was finalized. They worked quickly to resolve water and sanitation concerns and opened the camp in the summer of 1964. The next big push for development at Camp Raymond was in the 1970s, when the Ranger house and Quartermaster-Trading Post building were constructed. The Handicraft shed and handicap shower facilities were added in 1988, the pool in 1990 and a lake in 2009. Today, Camp Raymond has 18 campsites, each with a wash stand, latrine, cooking area, picnic tables, and running water. Camp Raymond is available for Boy Scout Troops and Cub Scout Packs for Troop Camping, Family Camping and District Camporees. Camp Raymond has an Archery Range and Shooting Range, including rifle and shotgun skeet ranges.

<doc id="102962" wikidata="Q7438537" url="?curid=102962" title="Scouting in California">
<text>Scouting in California has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs related to their environments.
==Early history (1910–1950)==
In the early days of ″Scouting″ there were several different ″Scouting″ type organizations. Some of the organizations known to have members in California were:
* American Boy Scout (also known as the United States Boy Scout organization)
* Boy Scouts of America (BSA)
* California Boy Scouts
* Peace Scouts of California

The Boy Scouts of United States (a wing of the National Highway Protective Association), Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association and the Salvation Army may have also had ″Scouting″ type programs in California.

In 1914, parents and Chinese-American boys organized their own Boy Scout troop in San Francisco, the first troop for Chinese Americans and possibly the first troop in San Francisco. It was recognized as Troop 3 once San Francisco became a council. The troop continues today.

==Recent history (1950–1990)==
The 1953 National Scout Jamboree was held at Irvine Ranch, California. Jamboree Road in Newport Beach, California was named to commemorate the site of the 1953 event.

The 1973 National Order of the Arrow Conference was held at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

==Boy Scouting in California today==

There are twenty-four Boy Scouts of America local councils in California.

===California Inland Empire Council===
The California Inland Empire Council (CIEC) was formed in 1973 through the merger of the Arrowhead Area (#048) and Riverside Area Councils (#045). In 1974 Grayback Council (#024) also merged into the new council. In 2006, the council acquired the San Bernardino County portions of Old Baldy Council (#043). The council territory includes all of Riverside and San Bernardino Counties.
===Crater Lake Council===

Crater Lake Council serves Scouts in Oregon and California.

===Golden Empire Council===
The Golden Empire Council (#047), first chartered in 1920, serves Scouts in a large section of Northern California, primarily the Sacramento Valley and the northern Sierra Nevada mountains. The council headquarters are located in Sacramento. The council covers 16 counties in Northern California: Amador, Butte, Colusa, El Dorado, Glenn, Nevada, Placer, Sacramento, Solano, Shasta, Sierra, Sutter, Tehama, Trinity, Yolo, and Yuba counties.
===Golden Gate Area Council===

=====Camp Bothin=====

Camp Bothin officially known as the Bothin Youth Center, is a Girl Scout summer camp. Since 1948 it has been located in Marin County, California. The site is managed by Girl Scouts of Northern California and supported mostly through private foundation grants and individual donations.

=====Convalescent home=====
In 1905 Camp Bothin was established as &quot;Hill Farm&quot;, a convalescent home for women and children, near Fairfax, California, on property then owned by Henry E. Bothin. Before antibiotics, medicine had few treatments other than rest and good food for many illnesses, especially tuberculosis (TB). The patients were initially housed in an old farmhouse. Normally, Hill Farm was home to 30 patients, but during the summer the mild climate allowed as many as 60, who were housed in tents and slept on cots. During this time, Miss Elizabeth H. Ashe was director.

In 1910, the officers formed the corporation named Bothin Convalescent Home for Women and Children. Mr. Bothin deeded of land to this corporation. The old farm house was torn down and a rustic building, now known as Manor House, was erected that could accommodate 40 patients. It had deep sleeping porches (fresh air was considered important for TB patients) and an outdoor dining room.

That same year the Arequipa Sanatorium, directed by Dr. Philip King Brown, was opened to serve women in the first stages of TB. At the time, the only known treatment was rest and good nutrition, in the hopes that the lungs could recover and heal. The name &quot;Arequipa&quot;, taken from a city in Peru, was said to be a Native American word signifying &#x27;place of rest.&#x27; Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, dust- and ash-filled air had contributed to a tuberculosis epidemic in San Francisco.

With the help of local artists and members of the area&#x27;s philanthropic community, Dr. Brown introduced therapeutic handcrafts to the women, to combat idleness and avoid the stigma of charity. The hospital hired potter Frederick Hurten Rhead to teach patients and develop a pottery studio. Work from the Arequipa pottery is now highly prized among collectors. In 1913 Rhead was dismissed for not being sufficiently businesslike, as he led his students to experiment with glazes and techniques, and tried to get the best materials for them. His successor at the pottery was directed to reduce production costs.

In 1917, the Bothin Helping Fund was incorporated. This organization, now known as the Bothin Foundation, was responsible for raising the $30,000 needed to build Stone House. It was here that professional and business women could come to rest and recuperate after illness.

As treatment methods for TB changed, the need for the Bothin Convalescent Hospital was reduced. The Bothin property was abandoned from 1922 to 1940.

=====Girl Scout camp=====
In 1948, Miss Ashe offered a small building now known as Little House to the San Francisco Girl Scouts for troop camping. A few years later she made Manor House available for Girl Scout use, and by 1955 the entire Bothin property was offered to the Council for its use. The Girl Scouts developed the property as a camp, and added a swimming pool. They changed the name to the Henry E. Bothin Youth Center.

In the 1950s, Arequipa was closed as a hospital. In 1959 the property was leased to the Girl Scouts. By 1963 both sides of the property began to operate as the Henry E. Bothin Youth Center.

<text>Scouting in Colorado has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day.
==Early history (1910–1950)==
Scouting got a brisk start in Colorado. The Denver Council was founded in 1915. In 1926 the name was changed to the Denver Area Council, and in 2022 the name was changed again to The Greater Colorado Council.

The Colorado Springs Council was founded in 1916, and in 1922 changed its name to the El Paso and Teller Counties Council. That council in 1925 changed its name to Pikes Peak Council, which it remains to this day. Pikes Peak Council is home to the oldest continually-chartered troop in the state of Colorado, Troop 2, originally chartered to Colorado Springs&#x27; First Presbyterian Church in October 1917.

The Greeley Council was founded in 1916, and in 1924 changed its name to the Weld and Morgan Counties Council. That council in 1928 changed its name to Longs Peak Council, which it remains to this day. The Fort Collins Council and Longmont Council, each founded in 1917, merged in 1919 into what is now the Longs Peak Council. The Boulder Council, also created in 1917, was merged into the Council in 1920. The Southeastern Wyoming Council of Cheyenne merged into Longs Peak Council in 1928.

The Trinidad-Las Animas County Council, founded in 1917, changed its name to the Las Animas County Council in 1924. This and the Arkansas Valley Council, founded in 1924, merged in 1927 to become the Spanish Peaks Council. The Pueblo Council was founded in 1920, and in 1928 changed its name to the Rocky Mountain Council, which it remains to this day. The Spanish Peaks Council merged into Rocky Mountain Council in 1932.

The Western Colorado Council was founded in 1942, and is one of the very few councils that did not undergo a name change or merger in its entire history until 2019. May 1, 2019 Western Area Council merged into the Denver Area Council. The new area council will now serve 24 counties, which includes more than 34,000 youth. The former council area is now the Majestic Mesas District of the Denver Area Council.

During World War II, Japanese Americans interned at the Granada War Relocation Center set up a separate &quot;Amache District&quot; for Scouts at the camp, after the camp&#x27;s unofficial name &quot;Camp Amache&quot;.

==Recent history (1950–2022)==
In 1952, a Capital Fund Campaign was held to raise money for a new camp, Tomahawk Ranch.

In 1960 Pikes Peak Council served as host to the 1960 National Scout Jamboree, held north of Colorado Springs adjacent to the United States Air Force Academy, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Boy Scouts of America.

*In 1927, the Arkansas Valley Council (#669) (founded in 1924), merged with Las Animas County Council (#064) (formed in 1924) to form the Spanish Peaks Council (#064).
*The Boulder Council was formed in 1917. 
*The Colorado Springs Council was formed in 1916. The El Paso &amp; Teller Counties Council (#060) was formed in 1922. In 1925 the two councils merged to become the Pikes Peak Council (#060)
*The Denver Council was formed in 1915, and changed its name in 1926 to the Denver Area Council (#061). 
*The Fort Collins Council was established in 1917.
*The Greeley Council (#062) was established in 1916. It became the Weld &amp; Morgan Counties Council in 1924.
*The Longmont Council was formed in 1917.
*The Longs Peak Council (#062) formed in 1925 from the merger of Longs Peak Council (#689), Weld &amp; Morgan Counties and Southeastern Wyoming Council (#639).
*The Pueblo Council (#063) was formed in 1920 and became the Rocky Mountain Council (#063) in 1928.
*The Trinidad-Las Animas County Council was formed in 1917.
*The Western Colorado Council was merged in the Greater Colorado Council.
*The Denver Area Council (#061) was renamed to the Greater Colorado Council and the council patch was changed in 2022.
* The Pikes Peak Council (#060) became the Pathway to the Rockies Council (#060) in 2022.

==Scouting in Colorado today==

There are five Boy Scouts of America (BSA) local councils and a single Girl Scouts of the USA council in Colorado, merged from an original five.

The first National Wider Opportunity for Senior Girl Scouts, &quot;Recall the Riches restore the Ruins,&quot; was held in Central City in 1973. In 1979, &quot;Sky Hi Ski,&quot; a National Wider Opportunity, was held at YMCA Snow Mountain Ranch near Granby and a Senior Girl Scout troop from Mile Hi Council participates in the opening ceremonies at the Winter Olympics at Lake Placid.

, all Girl Scouts from the state are joined as &quot;Girl Scouts of Colorado Council&quot;.

===Greater Colorado Council===
The Greater Colorado Council, previously named Denver Area Council, of the Boy Scouts of America is headquartered in Lakewood, Colorado, and supports Scouting units and youth in an area of central Colorado from Arapahoe and Adams Counties east to the Continental Divide.

====Organization====
For traditional units, the council is split into districts related by school districts. These districts are:

====Programs and activities====
National Youth Leadership Training (NYLT) is a week-long youth oriented leadership training experience held for three weeks during the summer. This camps aims to shape youth scouts into full trained scouts and was previously named Bighorn, now it is called NYLT at Bighorn, symbolizing the area that it takes place in.

====Camps====
The Denver Area Council operates camps in two locations in Colorado. The primary camp, &quot;Peaceful Valley Scout Ranch&quot;, is located in Elbert, Colorado. The second, smaller camp, is &quot;Camp Tahosa&quot;, located near Nederland, Colorado.

=====Tahosa High Adventure Base=====
&quot;Camp Tahosa (TH)&quot; is a camp near Ward, Colorado, serving the Denver Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America. It was the primary camp for the Denver area until the later 1970s, when it was shut down because of damage caused by environmental factors, where It was replaced by &quot;Peaceful Valley Scout Ranch&quot;. The camp now serves as a high adventure base. The High Adventure Treks from Camp Tahosa lead Scouts into the adjacent forest.

Tahosa is home to separate camping programs for both Summer and non summer usage: From September to Early May, TH offers OKPIK, Tahosa Challenge (COPE), and weekend camping. During the summer months, TH offers a variety of programs including National Youth Leadership Training, Mountain Men (provisional camping), Alpine Adventure, Tahosa Trek, and EaglePoint.

Alpine Adventure is a six night mountaineering adventure in the high country of Colorado, combining the training facilities of Tahosa High Adventure Base with the lakes and vistas of the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area. The Scout will be members of a 12-person team, learning and applying skills to conquer the strenuous challenges of the program in a dynamic mountain environment.

Tahosa Trek was started in 1995 to provide a basic knowledge of backpacking/low impact camping, the program now offers more advanced training and longer, customized treks for the units of the Boy Scouts of America.

Okpik is a weekend extreme winter camping experience design to train Scouts in winter survival. The program starts with a classroom session on Friday night to prepare the scouts. On Saturday, the scouts will load equipment and supplies into sleds before snowshoeing around Tumblesome Lake. On the far shore of the lake, participants use the remainder of the day to construct quinzhees which they spend the night in.

Tahosa Challenge is part of the Project COPE program that encourages youth and adults to expand mental creativity, increase physical abilities, promote leadership skills and instill personal confidence.

EaglePoint is the newest addition to Tahosa. Founded in 2000 at Peaceful Valley Scout Ranch, EaglePoint is a troop run camp with access to the Tahosa High Adventure Base facilities. With a small staff, troops can build their own schedule and do whatever they would like for their week at camp. This program had a predecessor that started as early as 1991 called Eagle Quest.

=====Peaceful Valley Scout Ranch=====

&quot;Peaceful Valley Scout Ranch (PV)&quot; is the main camping location of the Greater Colorado Council of the Boy Scouts of America. The camp, built in the 1960s by the Army Corps of Engineers, was a replacement to the original camp, Camp Tahosa. The camp is located just outside Elbert, Colorado.

Peaceful Valley Scout Ranch is home to three separate camps: Camp Cris Dobbins; Camp Cortland Dietler; and Magness Adventure Camp. Like Tahosa, Peaceful Valley also hosted a troop-run camp also called EaglePoint; however, as of 2009, EaglePoint is defunct (the EaglePoint program at Tahosa is still active, though). Additionally, in 2005, the Boy Scouts of America Denver Area Council acquired a large section of land adjacent to Peaceful Valley, and is the location of their Magness Adventure Camp for Cub Scouts.

Facilities include the Travis Shooting Sports Facility, which contains an Olympic shotgun shooting range, the Gates Aquatic Center, a horse corral, BB Gun range, two lakes, and the three above mentioned camps. The camp also has a bronze boot print casts of Robert Baden Powell located near the main camp office.

Camp Cris Dobbins is the flagship camp of Peaceful Valley. The camp is home to The Travis Shooting Facility, which includes an Olympic shotgun range, the million dollar Gates Aquatic Center, a dining hall which underwent a nearly twelve million dollar renovation and expansion in 2019, and over twenty campsites. The camp, with a capacity of around 700 campers, offers dozens of merit badges and programs for scouts of all ages.

Camp Dietler, founded in 1988 by William Eck, is a patrol style summer camp experience. While merit badges are offered, the main focus is on the patrol method. This is carried out through patrol cooking, events determined by the patrol leader&#x27;s council, and a choice of two high adventure outposts. The camp is named for Cortlandt Dietler, who donated the money to build the camp commissary.

Magness Adventure Camp is the Denver Area Council&#x27;s Cub Scouting camp. The camp has three shelters, each with a campsite housing eighty tents. The program includes lake activities, a BB Gun range, an archery range, recently added a slingshot paint ball range and a firewatch tower that overlooks Elbert County. The camp is also available for rental by outside groups, and is often frequented by groups such as Denver&#x27;s High School ROTC and girls groups from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

====Tahosa Lodge====
Tahosa Lodge #383, chartered in 1948, serves 1218 Arrowmen as of 2004. It is the largest lodge in Colorado. The lodge totem is a coney (Pika), and the name translates to &quot;Dwellers on the Mountain Tops&quot; in the Kiowa language. The lodge is divided into seven chapters which correspond with the seven districts of the Denver Area Council. Tahosa Lodge holds their ordeal weekends and other events at the two council camps, Peaceful Valley Scout Ranch and Tahosa Scout Camp. Many patches from the lodge feature a character known as the Purple Bishop, and delegates of the lodge to NOAC can often be seen wearing purple cloaks. The Purple Bishop is a legend from Camp Tahosa.

===Great Southwest Council===

The &quot;Great Southwest Council&quot; serves the Durango and Mesa Verde areas of Colorado, and includes Cascade Boy Scout Camp on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Adventure West Council===

&quot;Adventure West Council&quot; of the Boy Scouts of America is headquartered in Greeley, Colorado. Composed of the former Longs Peak Council (named after the tallest peak in the council territory) and the former Greater Wyoming Council, the Adventure West Council supports Scouting youth in northeastern Colorado north of Denver, central and eastern Wyoming and the panhandle of western Nebraska, and is chartered by BSA to organize, extend, support, and control the Scouting program within its exclusive territory. The &quot;WyoBraska Council&quot; of Scottsbluff merged into the Longs Peak Council in 1975, and Longs Peak Council merged with the Greater Wyoming Council to form the Adventure West Council in 2021.

====Organization====
The council&#x27;s territory is divided into seven geographic districts:
Adventure West Council - Districts Map

* Bighorn District
* Frontier District
* Golden Plains District
* Shoshone District
* Thunder Basin District
* Tri-Trails District
* Wapiti District

====Ben Delatour Scout Ranch====

Encompassing at to in elevation, &quot;Ben Delatour Scout Ranch&quot; near Red Feather Lakes, Colorado is operated by the Adventure West Council and includes four Scout Camps:

* Jack Nicol Cub Scout Camp
* Camp Charles Jeffrey (Boy Scout Camp)
* Soaring Eagle (Boy Scout Camp)
* Elkhorn High Adventure Base

&quot;Camp Charles Jeffrey and Soaring Eagle&quot; features several summer program areas including Rock Climbing at the Pancake Climbing Base and on some of the many peaks in the camp, C.O.P.E. (Challenging Outdoor Personal Experience), Shooting Sports, Scout Skills, Handicraft, and Nature Studies offered through a traditional Merit Badge program. The camp also has a Scouting Museum and Chuck Wagon Cooking area where traditional dutch oven meals are prepared daily. Scout units can choose between a dining hall experience or a patrol cook option where meals are cooked at your campsite.

&quot;Elkhorn High Adventure Base&quot; is open to older scouts and Venture Crews for a week of backpacking the Rockies. Backpacking treks of various difficulty levels are offered on the ranch property and in the nearby Routt, Roosevelt, and Arapahoe National Forests. Shooting sports, C.O.P.E, climbing and repelling, a horse program, and white water rafting activities round out week-long treks or 10-day-long super-treks.

&quot;Jack Nicol Cub Scout Camp&quot; is the newest resident camp on the ranch, completed in 2001. It offers age-appropriate programs that are not necessarily designed for rank advancement. Camp Nicol consists of 3 major themed program areas (Fort Unfug, Castle Walker, and the Everett Seaport) and offers a summer program featuring a new camp-wide theme each year. The 2014 theme is Time Travel. Program activities include BB gun and archery shooting, hiking, handicrafts, hiking, games and a &#x27;light parade&#x27; around the lake at night.

Ben Delatour Scout Ranch includes summer camp and year-round camping, with several buildings available for year-round use. The ranch has been an active site for sustainable forestry and in 2011, the ranch became protected from future development through a conservation easement with The Conservation Fund, the Longs Peak Council, and the Colorado State Forest Service.

====Chimney Park Scout Camp====

&quot;Chimney Park Boy Scout Camp&quot; is located in the Snowy Range Mountains, approximately west of Laramie, Wyoming on US Highway 230 and about west of Woods Landing, Wyoming. The approximate coordinates for the Baldwin Lodge are 41° 4&#x27; 19.78&quot; N 106° 6&#x27; 29.2&quot; W (NAD83/WGS84).

Chimney Park Boy Scout Camp offers year-round camping, especially winter camps, at an altitude of about . The winter snow depth varies typically from 30 to 150 cm (1 to five feet), and the winter daytime high temperatures vary typically from -9 to +7 °C (+15 to +45 °F) The winter nighttime low temperatures vary typically from -26 to 0 °C (-15 to +32 °F). A lodge with a stove and fireplace are available. Lodge use must be reserved through the Longs Peak Council Office. There is a usage fee. See https://campreservation.com/062/Camps/909 for more information.

====Camp Laramie Peak====

&quot;Camp Laramie Peak&quot;, at the base of Black Mountain near Wheatland, Wyoming, offers summer camp and year-round camping. It was purchased in 1920 by a group of volunteers wanting a place to take Scouts in the wilderness. The rugged terrain, rambling brooks, and mountain backdrop offer Troops a place to experience the traditional camp experience including the merit badge camp program. The camp also offers a first-year camper program, horseback riding, rock climbing, ziplines, mountain boarding, and mountain biking.

Hiking is available in the camp and in the nearby Medicine Bow National Forest, including to the top of Laramie Peak. The elevation at the Camp is approximately , and summer temperatures range from the 40s at night to the 90s during the day.

====Camp Patiya====

&quot;Camp Patiya&quot; is a 30-acre camping and day-use camp about seven miles west of Boulder, Colorado. Camp Patiya was started by the Camp Fire Girls. The Camp Fire Council purchased the original twenty acres for the camp in 1960 and began holding group and family camps shortly thereafter. All the buildings on site were constructed between 1963 and 1981. In 1977, an additional ten acres of land was donated, bringing the camp to its present size. Camp Fire continued to hold group camping year-round and Day Camps in the summers. In the 1980s, membership in Camp Fire declined. In 1987, it was determined that the goals for operating the camp could best be met by transferring the ownership to Adventure West Council.

====Kola Lodge====
Kola Lodge #464, chartered in 1951, serves over 100 Arrowmen as of 2022. The totem of this Lodge is the Fire of Friendship centered in a gray arrowhead with a red feather and an antelope antler in the background, and the name translates to &quot;Friend&quot; in the Lakota language. In 1973, Kola Lodge absorbed Wiyaka Luta #403 of the Wyo-Braska Council. In 2021 Kola Lodge absorbed Tatokainyanka Lodge #359 of Greater Wyoming Council.

===Pathway to the Rockies Council===
The &quot;Pathway to the Rockies Council,&quot; formerly known as the Pikes Peak Council, of the Boy Scouts of America, headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Named after the most famous peak in the council territory, upon which &#x27;America the Beautiful&#x27; was written, Pathway to the Rockies Council provides Scouting to youth in east-central Colorado, including Park, Teller, El Paso, Elbert, Lincoln, Kit Carson and Cheyenne Counties.

As with &quot;Longs Peak Council&quot;, there is officially no apostrophe in the name, due to a ruling about the mountain itself by the Board on Geographic Names.

On board the Space Shuttle Challenger when it disintegrated in 1986 was an American flag that was sponsored by Troop 514 of Monument, Colorado. When the Challenger wreckage was retrieved from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, this flag was found, sealed in a plastic bag, intact and completely unscathed.

====History====
In 1960, Colorado Springs host the 50th National Scout Jamboree. Known as the BSA Golden Jubilee, its theme was &quot;For God and Country&quot; and from July 22 to July 28, 1960, over 56,377 scouts and scouters were in attendance. Today, remnants of the 50th Jamboree can be found throughout Colorado Springs.

The council has an international relationship with Scouts in Kyrgyzstan.

In July 2005, Pathway to the Rockies Council moved from its four-decade home downtown to a temporary location in northeast Colorado Springs until the council&#x27;s new headquarters at the intersection of I-25 and Fillmore Street was finished in July 2008, to account for the demographic and geographic shift of Colorado Springs. The vacated original building became the home of Sario, a Lions Club project.

====Camps====

=====Camp Alexander=====
The council camp, &quot;Camp Alexander&quot;, is located in the Eleven Mile Canyon in the Pike National Forest approximately west of Colorado Springs, and two miles (3 km) south of Lake George, in Park County, was donated in 1946 by J. Don Alexander of the Alexander Film Company. There are a series of &quot;Burma Shave&quot;-style signs on the main road into camp, each sign having one of the points of the Scout Law. Camp Alexander is between 8200 and elevation. The camp area consists of hills, low mountains, and valleys covered by a mix of Ponderosa pine forests, high-altitude grasslands, and wetland vegetation along the lake and stream. In the 2012 Springer Wildfire, the camp was evacuated, and parts of the camp were used by firefighters as staging and defensible spaces.

=====Glen Aspen Scout Ranch=====
In 2008, the Pathway to the Rockies Council acquired a beautiful parcel of land containing 200 acres just outside of Woodland Park in a gift from the estate of Leonard Johnson Jr. The property is surrounded on most sides by the Pike National Forest. The property is hilly with several streams running through the property. The land is covered with varieties of foliage including pine, cedar, and of course Aspen. Wildlife is abundant and includes a herd of Elk, deer, bear, red-tailed hawks, eagles, foxes, coyotes, rabbits, squirrels, and much more.

====Order of the Arrow====
Ha-Kin-Skay-A-Ki Lodge #387, chartered in 1948, serves 743 Arrowmen as of 2004. The lodge totem is a Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, and the name is said to translate to &quot;Great Horned Goat of the Mountain&quot; but does not specify the language or dialect. Until 1953, the lodge was simply known as Pike&#x27;s Peak Lodge.

In response to the 2012 Waldo Canyon Fire that affected Colorado Springs, the lodge released a fundraising lodge flap featuring a bighorn sheep looking over a burning area.

===Rocky Mountain Council===

The &quot;Rocky Mountain Council&quot; of the Boy Scouts of America is headquartered in Pueblo, Colorado, and provides program services to over 100 chartered partner organizations, delivering Scouting to more than 4,600 youth through 167 Scout units in 19 counties of Southern Colorado, including Pueblo, Fremont, Crowley, Kiowa, Prowers, Bent, Otero, Baca, Las Animas, Costilla, Conejos, Mineral, Rio Grande, Alamosa, Saguache, Huerfano, Custer, Lake and Chaffee Counties.

==== Transitional Charter ====
In May 2021 following the National Annual Meeting of the BSA, the Rocky Mountain Council received notification that the council charter had been changed to a transitional charter. Instructions where that the council was to merge with the Pikes Peak Council by August 1, 2021. While no specific reason was provided as to why the Rocky Mountain Council had been issued this transitional charter, it is assumed that this merger occurred due to the bankruptcy lawsuit with that National Council and the requirement to show the courts that structural changes were occurring to support the financial future of the Boy Scouts of America.

On August 1, 2021, the Rocky Mountain Council officially merged with the Pikes Peak Council to form the Pikes Peak - Rocky Mountain Council.

In September 2021, the council executive board voted on the new name of the merged council to be Pathway to the Rockies.

====Organization====
* Cuerno Verde District
* High Mountain District
* Pioneer Trails District

====Camps====
* Rocky Mountain High Adventure Base: Located on San Isabel Scout Ranch, formerly Packard High Adventure Base.
* San Isabel Scout Ranch: Located near San Isabel

==== Tupwee Gudas Gov Youchiquot Soovep Lodge ====
Tupwee Gudas Gov Youchiquot Soovep Lodge #536, chartered in 1958, serves 117 Arrowmen as of 2004. The lodge totem is a &quot;Populus tremuloides&quot; or Rocky Mountain quaking aspen. Also known as Tupwee Lodge, its rather long name refers to its totem in the Ute language. The name means land of the quaking aspens.

===Western Colorado Council===

The &quot;Western Colorado Council&quot; of the Boy Scouts of America was founded in 1942. In May 2019 the council merged with the Denver Area Council.

* Grand Mesa District serves Mesa County, and also hosts the council office
* Majestic Mountain District serves Hinsdale, Gunnison, Ouray, San Miguel, Montrose and Delta counties, a geographic area approximately the same size as the state of Connecticut
* Three Rivers District serves Garfield, Eagle, Summit, Pitkin, Moffat, Routt, Grand, and Rio Blanco counties

====Mic-O-Say Lodge====
Mic-O-Say Lodge #541, chartered in 1959, serves 168 Arrowmen as of 2004. The lodge totem is an eagle. Prior to 1960 there was not an Order of the Arrow Lodge (OA) serving Western Colorado Council (WC-C). The Council honor camping organization had previously been the Tribe of Mic-O-Say (MOS) (also existing in some Councils in Kansas and Missouri) which had been founded by H. Roe Bartle. However, with the arrival of a new WC-C Scout Executive, a decision was made to discontinue MOS and replace it with an OA lodge which was officially recognized by the BSA. As a compromise, the lodge was allowed to retain the name &quot;Mic-O-Say&quot; and to continue some of the MOS insignia and traditions. The traditional MOS Eagle Claws were permitted to be worn by youth and adult members suspended from a French braid spiral lanyard in the tribal official red, white and blue craftstrip colors.

====Summer camps====

===== Steve Fossett Spirit of Adventure Ranch =====
The Steve Fossett Spirit of Adventure Ranch (SOAR) was launched in Summer 2014. The camp was located in the Colorado Rockies near the eastern entrance of Glenwood Canyon, 8 miles off of I-70 from the Dotsero exit. The camp closed after the 2018 summer season, when it served as an alternate high adventure base for scouts unable to attend Philmont due to summer fires. The council merger did not include plans to renew the lease for the camp.

=====Spanish Peaks Scout Ranch=====
The Spanish Peaks Scout Ranch (SPSR) is located near Walsenburg, Colorado and borders the Spanish Peaks Wilderness. It is a local council camp of the Santa Fe Trail Council based out of Garden City, Kansas. The camp gives program geared toward outdoor education such as wilderness backpacking, climbing, and outdoor skills. In 2013, the camp was partially destroyed by a wildfire which destroyed over 13,500 acres. The camp has since been rebuilt and has re-opened for operation.

==Girl Scouting in Colorado==
===History===

In 1955, $600 was raised to help restore Juliette Low&#x27;s birthplace. In 1959, the Girl Scouts of Metro Denver council name changed to Girl Scouts-Mile Hi Council, which remained the name until 2007. In 1967, troops for girls with special needs were started at Fletcher Miller School and at Fort Logan.

International Girl Scout gatherings named Senior Roundups were held every three years from 1956 until 1965. The National Girl Scouts of the USA Roundup was held from July 3 to July 12, 1959, adjacent to the site of the then-new United States Air Force Academy north of Colorado Springs, attended by 10,000 girls.

====Oldest living GSUSA Girl Scout====

The oldest living Girl Scout was Marianne Elser Crowder, born in Colorado Springs in April 1906. She joined the Wagon Wheel Council Troop 4 in 1918 and was awarded her Golden Eaglet, which was then the GSUSA highest award. She later operated her own dance studio in Colorado Springs and headed the dance department at Colorado College before moving to Menlo Park, California in 1939. The Wagon Wheel Council named Crowder the nation&#x27;s oldest Girl Scout after it conducted a nationwide search and sifted through council archives.

===Girl Scouts of Colorado===

The Girl Scouts of Colorado was formed in 2007 by a realignment of the five councils that had been serving the state, and the incorporation of nine counties that were previously served by councils in border states. The five previous Colorado councils were Mile Hi (Denver), Wagon Wheel (Colorado Springs), Columbine (Pueblo), Mountain Prairie (Fort Collins), Chipeta (Grand Junction); and the eight Colorado counties previously served by councils in other states were Archuleta, Dolores, Jackson, La Plata, Las Animas, Montezuma, Prowers and San Juan. The council serves 40,500 girl members and 11,000 adult volunteers.

Girl Scouts of Colorado has service center locations in Colorado Springs, Denver, Durango, Fort Collins, Grand Junction and Pueblo. There are also staff members who work in other areas of the state such as Bailey, Breckenridge, Estes Park, Crowley, Greeley, Johnstown, Longmont, Merino, Monte Vista, Parachute, Sterling, Trinidad, Red Feather Lakes, Sanford, Steamboat Springs and Woodland Park. Additionally, Girl Scouts of Colorado has divided the state into eight regions.

The council maintains three resident camp properties:
* Magic Sky Ranch, near Red Feather Lakes, Larimer County is 
* Sky High Ranch, Woodland Park, Teller County established in 1952 has 
* Tomahawk Ranch, near Bailey, Park County is 
And some regular camps:
* Meadow Mountain Ranch, near Estes Park, Boulder County is at above sea level.
* Kiwa Korral, near Lyons, Boulder County
* Hamp Hut, in Garden of the Gods Park, El Paso County. Built in 1953.
* Lazy Acres, near Pueblo, Pueblo County established in 1945
* Pawnee Lodge, near Sterling, Logan County

===Suwannee River Area Council===
The Suwannee River Area Council, active from 1924 to present, encompasses 13 counties in north Florida and south Georgia. The Council Service Center and central headquarters are in Tallahassee, Florida. Since opening in 1924, the Suwannee River Area Council has offered traditional Scouting programs at several camps.

====Camps====

The first was Camp Orchard Pond, located near Tallahassee. Orchard Pond was a small camp, having only four campsites during its entire lifetime. It was used from 1927 to 1947, when it was sold. The council moved its summer camp operations to Camp Semialachee, located on the west side of Moore Lake south of SR 20 on the Silver Lake Road west of Tallahassee. Semialachee got its name indirectly from the union of &quot;Seminole&quot; and &quot;Apalachee&quot;, two primary groups of Native Americans in the United States from the north Florida region. Camp Semialachee was kept until 1965, when camping was moved to Wallwood Scout Reservation, located just south of Quincy, Florida. The land for the new camp was donated by Dr. Charlie K. Wall and his wife Margaret as a gift to Scouting. The buildings and equipment were donated by various community leaders, Scouters, and organizations. The dedication of Wallwood came in 1964, the buildings were constructed in 1965, and the first camping season was the summer of 1966. Wallwood covers over of land bordered on one side by a branch of Lake Talquin. The camp offers a variety of Scouting programs, including COPE, as well as opportunities for other civic organizations. There are currently two camping facilities at the Wallwood Reservation - Camp Nea Mathla and Camp Tom Matherly.

<text>Scouting in Hawaii began in the 1900s. It serves thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live.

==Early history prior to statehood (1908-1960)==

The first troop in the islands, appropriately numbered Troop 1, was founded by a British Scouter just recently relocated, and chartered to Kawaiahao Church. One Saturday, former Queen Liliuokalani was driven past Kapiolani Park in Honolulu, and noticed this troop going through Scouting drills. She stopped and enquired what manner of military play this was, and the Scouts eagerly explained the concept of Scouting to her. On a following Saturday a month later, the Queen reappeared, and presented to the troop a Hawaiian flag. Emblazoned upon the red-white-and-blue stripes were the Hawaiian royal crest and the lettering in gold &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Own Troop&quot;, which she had labored at herself. As the Scoutmaster was an Englishman, in their tradition of naming rather than numbering troops, the appellation stuck. The unit claiming longest continuous charter is Troop 1.

Troop 5 up until the early 1980s held the distinction of the longest continuously chartered unit in Hawaii. It was Troop 5 that was known as &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Own Troop&quot; that received the flag which was made by her own hands. The flag was held by the Liliuokalani Trust until it was given to the Aloha Council BSA by a previous Assistant Scoutmaster, David Jeong of Troop 5. The flag was given as part of the Centennial Celebration of Scouting in 2010. One of Troop 5&#x27;s Scoutmasters, &quot;Kimo&quot; James Austin Wilder was also a founder of the Sea Scout program.

David McHattie Forbes was the founder of Scouting in Waimea in the early 1900s.

In 1946, Scouts helped re-introduce the endangered nene into the Haleakala National Park by carrying young birds into the Haleakala Crater in their backpacks.

The Honolulu Council (#104) was founded in 1914, and became the Honolulu County Council in 1924. In 1957, the council became the Aloha Council.

==History since statehood ==

In 1972, the third Hawaiian council, Kilauea Council (#103) based in Hilo (founded in 1922) merged with the Aloha Council.

=== Maui County Council ===

Maui County Council was founded in 1917, and until 2019, was one of the very few councils that have not undergone a name change or merger in its entire history. With headquarters in Wailuku, Maui, the council served the islands of Moloka&#x27;i, Lāna&#x27;i and Maui. In 2019, the Maui County Council merged with the Aloha Council.

====Camps====

* Camp Maluhia

====Order of the Arrow====

Maluhia Lodge 554, chartered in 1962, was made up of Arrowmen from the Maui County Council (Maui, Lāna&#x27;i, Moloka&#x27;i). The lodge totem was a Hawaiian warrior wearing an ipu (gourd) mask that represents the Hawaiian god Lono. Given that the word &quot;maluhia&quot; in Hawaiian means &quot;peace&quot;, it was fitting that Lono, the Hawaiian god of peace, was represented in the lodgeʻs totem. When the Maui County Council and the Aloha Council merged in 2019, Maluhia Lodge was absorbed in Nā Mokupuni o Lawelawe Lodge and became Nā Koa Chapter.
==Scouting in Hawaii today==

There is only one Scouting America, Aloha Council (BSA) local council in Hawaii. As of February 2025, the organization is now known as Scouting America, Aloha Council.

===Aloha Council===

Scouting America, Aloha Council is headquartered in Honolulu, and supports Scouting units around the Pacific Basin. The Aloha Council encompasses Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Marianas, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Palau. The Aloha Council covers the largest geographical area in the world, over , spanning on both sides of the equator and international dateline.

In 2004, Scouts attended local council camps on American Samoa, Hawaii&#x27;s Big Island, Guam, Kauai and Oahu. Aloha Council Pacific Basin District outreach efforts in the Pacific continue to grow with over 835 Scouts and 240 Cub Scouts attending camps on Chuuk, Pohnpei, Kosrae, Saipan, Kwajalein, Rongelap, Majuro, Yap and Palau.

In 2018, the 45-year-old council badge was changed to include a green sea turtle and names the three primary locations serviced, &quot;Hawaii - American Samoa - Guam&quot;.

====Camps====
*Camp Alan Faye 
*Camp Honokaia
*Camp Pupukea
*Camp Maluhia

====Order of the Arrow====
The Nā Mokupuni O Lawelawe Lodge 567, chartered in 1973, serves 100 Arrowmen as of 2021. The lodge totem is a pueo (Hawaiian owl), the lodge symbol is a Hawaiian outrigger canoe, and the name translates to &quot;Islands of Service&quot; in the Hawaiian language. In 1973, Kamehameha Lodge 454 (chartered in 1951 to the Kilauea Council in Hilo) and Achsin Lodge 565 (chartered in 1970 to the Chamorro Council on Guam) merged with Pupukea Lodge 557 (chartered in 1962, the original Aloha Council lodge) to form the larger lodge. In 2019 the Maluhia Lodge 554 ( chartered in 1962 to the Maui County Council in Wailuku) which was merged into the Aloha Council

====Hawaiiana Award====

The Hawaiiana Award is offered by the Aloha Council and is dedicated to the perpetuation of the skills crafts and legends of old Hawaii. The award was established in 1973 and has been offered continuously by the Aloha Council to its members and Scouts visiting the Hawaiian islands.

The requirements for Hawaiiana include the composition of a 750-word essay on the pre-European history of the Hawaiian people; the collection of at least five representative leaves or flowers of native fauna from four specific zones of the island; the development of a sketchbook detailing five native birds; the recitation of the Scout Oath, Law, Motto and Slogan in Hawaiian and offer its English translation; the recitation of twenty five Hawaiian place names and their meanings; the recitation of 25 common Hawaiian terms and their meanings; participation in a series of Hawaiian games; participation in six methods of Hawaiian cooking; preparation of traditional foods without cooking; the demonstration of a Hawaiian method of fishing; the construction and demonstration of a number of Hawaiian implements; the oral recitation of names and facts surrounding five famous Hawaiians from the years before 1779; the demonstration of two forms of hula and accompanying chants; the conduct of a Hawaiian play; visitation to at least two historical sites and the completion of a report detailing the visit.

These broad and comprehensive requirements are detailed in the 168 page guidebook published by the Aloha Council and available at the Council offices. The Hawaiiana award itself is in the form of a base metal medal with polished highlights suspended from a red and gold ribbon, featuring a poi pounding stone with a flaming torch in front. There is also a corresponding 3&quot; embroidered patch that may be worn on the right pocket of the Scout shirt.

==Girl Scouting in Hawaii==

Girl Scouting started in Hawaii in 1917 with two troops in Oahu. Troop 1 at the Kamehameha School for Girls completed their paperwork first, but Troop 2 in Kaka‘ako asked for the sponsorship of Lili&#x27;uokalani, the last monarch of Hawaii, and were promised her own flag that was given after her death. The Oahu council was established in 1918 and chartered in 1919. Other islands followed until Kauai had its first troop in 1936. In 1963 the Girl Scout Council of Oahu expanded to include all of Hawaii as well as Wake and Midway and was renamed Girl Scout Council of the Pacific. Wake and Midway were later dropped and in 1990 the council was renamed Girl Scout Council of Hawaii.
===Girl Scouts of Hawai&#x27;i===

The Girl Scouts of Hawai&#x27;i has about 5,500 girl and adult members.

<text>Scouting in Kansas has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live. 
==Early history (1910−1950)==

The Brewer Scout Cabin in Solomon is on the National Register of Historic Places.

Mrs. Fern E. Sears was the organizer of the first Kansas City, Kansas council of Girl Scouts and author of a book on Christian symbols, &quot;Let Me Speak&quot;. She trained Girl Scout leaders and established troops in Kansas City, Kansas in 1948 when the area qualified for a council, called the Santa Fe Trail council. Mrs. Sears was named first president, and was an honorary life president at the time of her death on August 24, 1959.

==Recent history (1950−present)==
In 1958 the National Order of the Arrow Conference was held at the University of Kansas.

In the 1990s and 2000s, BTK killer, also known as Dennis Rader, was a part of the Cub Scouts. He was a leader.

===Scouting in Kansas today===
There are seven Boy Scouts of America (BSA) local councils in Kansas.

====Coronado Area Council====

Coronado Area Council serves north central and northwest Kansas, across 32 counties, with headquarters in Salina.

====Heart of America Council====
Heart of America Council serves Scouts in Missouri and Kansas.

====Jayhawk Area Council====

In 1928 the &quot;Topeka Council&quot; took over 39 counties across northern Kansas and became the Jayhawk Area Council.

*Bison District
*Pony Express District
*Sojadi District
*Sunflower District

=====Camps=====
The Jayhawk Area Council operates the 340 acre Falley Scout Reservation, which is divided into Camp Jayhawk (Scouts BSA Summer Camp) and Camp Delaware (Cub Scout Programs).

====Ozark Trails Council====
Ozark Trails Council serves Scouts in Missouri and Kansas.

====Pony Express Council====

The Pony Express Council is based in Saint Joseph, Missouri, and also serves Scouts in Kansas.

====Quivira Council====
Quivira Council serves youth in south central Kansas, with headquarters in Wichita. Kansa Lodge #198, Order of the Arrow serves local Arrowmen. They currently operate two camps: Camp Kanza (Cub Scouts and Webelos), which provides the name for their Lodge; and Quivira Scout Ranch (Scouts BSA and Venturers), at which they host their largest summer camp program each summer, and offer Black Jack Trail, an introduction to backpacking, twice a year.

*High Plains District
*Kanza District
*Osage Nation District
*Pawnee District
*South Winds District
*White Buffalo District

The Quivira Council website http://www.quivira.org/ has links to each district.

====Santa Fe Trail Council====
Santa Fe Trail Council includes nineteen counties in southwestern Kansas, with headquarters in Garden City.

=====Spanish Peaks Scout Ranch=====

The Spanish Peaks Scout Ranch (SPSR) is located near Walsenburg, Colorado and borders the Spanish Peaks Wilderness. It is a local council camp of the Santa Fe Trail Council based out of Garden City. The camp gives program geared toward outdoor education such as wilderness backpacking, climbing, and outdoor skills.

======Spanish Peaks Staff Association======

Spanish Peaks Staff Association (SPSA) is a non-profit organization dedicated to connecting current, former, and honorary staffers of Spanish Peaks Scout Ranch (SPSR). The organization was formed by like-minded staff alumni committed to the continued support of SPSR and the love of outdoor education for youth. Although the Spanish Peaks Staff Association is not an alumni association the members have all worked with this Scout camp and are dedicated toward outdoor education for youth.

======Purpose======

The Spanish Peaks Staff Association, although still in their infant stages, has adapted the purposes of:

:(a) Demonstrating support for Spanish Peaks Scout Ranch and its continued value in the future.
:(b) Providing vision and leadership for Spanish Peaks Scout Ranch.
:(c) Raising volunteer and financial support for Spanish Peaks Scout Ranch improvement endeavors.
:(d) Establishing an endowment that will guarantee the future stability of the SPSR independently of Santa Fe Trail Council operations.
:(e) Establishing an endowment that insures continued funding of a full-time ranger at Spanish Peaks Scout Ranch.
:(f) Providing a forum for past, present, and future staffers to gather, share ideas, and stay in contact.

======Structure======
The Spanish Peaks Staff Association (SPSA) is independent of the Santa Fe Trail Council and Spanish Peaks Scout Ranch. They are, however, dedicated to the youth of southwest Kansas and promotion of outdoor education. The organization was chartered in 2006 as a response to a struggling economy and the Santa Fe Trail Council&#x27;s Board deficit. The lack of the council&#x27;s ability to secure funds for operating expenses led to SPSA&#x27;s motivation and primary goal of securing funds separate of the council.

*Buffalo Range District
*Cimarron District
*High Plains District

<text>Scouting in Montana has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live.

==Early history (1910-1950)==
The first, Boy Scout troop in Montana was organized in Butte in September of 1910 by Elizabeth Groenveld. In February 1917 &quot;Troop 1&quot; in Butte held an event for the public which included music, as well as &quot;exhibition drills, first aid work, and signalling, closing with the presentation of a play.&quot; Also in 1917, this same troop made the news because their activities inspired the creation of a new troop in nearby Centerville, &quot;Twenty-two boys made the trip [a hike from Butte to Divide and back], which was filled with tests for the boys... En route one of the boys suffered from a strained back. A litter was built for him and he was carried to the destination. This was a test in first-aid work... Another hike will be held when the weather permits. The boys were forced to trudge through deep snow on their Washington birthday trip.&quot;

By 1918, unofficial Wolf Cub packs appeared in Butte.

In 1920, the Deer Lodge County Council (#314) was formed, changing its name in 1924 to the Deer Lodge Area Council (#314). In 1926 the Deer Lodge Area Council changed its name to the Deer Lodge, Granite, and Powell Council (#314). In 1928, the Deer Lodge, Granite, and Powell Council merged into the Silver Bow Council (#313). In 1919, the Helena Council (#316) was formed, changing its name in 1925 to the Lewis and Clark Area Council (#316) and, changing its name again in 1931 to the Elkhorn Area Council (#316). The Elkhorn Area Council closed that same year. In 1922, the Helena Council (#317) was formed, changing its name in 1923 to the Glacier Park Area Council (#317). The Glacier Park Area Council closed in 1927. In 1920, the Park County Council (#319) was formed, changing its name in 1923 to the Park and Sweetgrass Counties Council (#319) and, changing its name again in 1924 to the Yellowstone Council (#319). The Yellowstone Council closed in 1926. In 1920, the Custer County Council (#321) was formed, changing its name in 1924 to the Powder River Area Council (#321) and, closing in 1926.

In 1918, the Butte City Council (#313) was formed, changing its name in 1927 to the Silver Bow Council (#313). In 1944, Silver Bow changed its name to the Vigilante Council (#313). In 1915, the Great Falls Council (#315) was formed, changing its name in 1925 to the Great Falls Area Council (#315). In 1929, the Great Falls Area Council changed its name to the North Central Montana Council (#315). In 1922, the Lewiston Council (#318) was formed, changing its name in 1922 to the Central Montana Council (#318). The Central Montana Council closed in 1924. In 1928, the Yellowstone Valley Council (#318) was formed. In 1920, the Missoula Council (#320) was formed, changing its name in 1922 to the Missoula County Council (#320). In 1926 the Missoula County Council changed its name to the Western Montana Council (#320).

==Recent history (1950-1990)==
In 1973, the Vigilante Area, Western Montana, Yellowstone Valley and North Central Montana councils all merged to make the Montana Council (#315).

==Boy Scouts of America in Montana today==

There are two Boy Scouts of America (BSA) local councils in Montana. Most of Montana lies within the Montana Council, except for Daniels and Sheridan counties, which are part of the Northern Lights Council.

<text>[[Scouting]] in Nevada has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live.

==Early history (1910-1950)==
The first Girl Scout troop in Nevada was formed in Boulder City, Nevada on April 15, 1932.

==Boy Scouts of America in Nevada today==
There are 2 Boy Scouts of America (BSA) local councils in Nevada.

===Las Vegas Area Council===

Formerly the &quot;Boulder Dam Area Council&quot;, the Las Vegas Area Council serves Scouts in Nevada, California and Arizona. The Boulder Dam Area Council was started in 1944 with fewer than 500 youth. The former council offices were in cramped spaces on the UNLV campus, but in 2002 they moved into the new facility, the Donald W. Reynolds Scouting Resource Center. The name of the council was changed to Las Vegas Area Council in 2005. It currently serves youth in Clark and Nye counties of southern Nevada, southeastern California, and western Arizona.

====Districts====

===Golden Empire Council===

Golden Empire Council serves Scouts in California and Nevada.

===Nevada Area Council===
Nevada Area Council serves 14,500 youth as of December 2006 in northern Nevada and northeastern California. Headquartered at 500 Double Eagle Ct., Reno, Nevada, with satellite offices located in Fernley, Elko, Carson City, and Susanville, California.

====Order of the Arrow====
Tannu Lodge 346 is the Order of the Arrow Lodge for the Nevada Area Council. Headquartered in Reno, Nevada, it spans from eastern California to Elko, Nevada.

=====History=====

In 1946 the Nevada Area Council chartered the Wiyaka Lodge, Order of the Arrow, to replace the Tribe of Nacopen as the council&#x27;s Honor Camper Society. &quot;Wiyaka&quot;, the Sioux word for feather, was chosen by camp director Larry Lake and was used as the Lodge name until 1961. In 1961, after a rather stagnant period, the lodge underwent a period of restructuring, and a new name and totem were deemed in order. The Pronghorn Antelope was chosen as the new totem and &quot;Tannu&quot;, the Shoshone-Paiute word for antelope or deer became the new lodge name.

During the 1960s the lodge grew in membership, and, as one of the larger Lodges in the old Area 12-C, we hosted the Area 12-C Conference at Galena Creek. As the Lodge prospered, its ability to fulfill its mission in promoting Scout camping grew as well. In 1972 the Lodge earned the E. Urner Goodman Camping Award for excellence in promotion of its camping program. During the mid-1970s the lodge experienced another downswing in membership and activity but rebounded under new leadership toward the end of the decade.

In 1974 the Lodge hosted the W3B Conclave at Sky Tavern. In 1982 it received the E. Urner Goodman Award for the second time, a feat considered quite rare. In 1986 Tannu Lodge hosted the Section W3B Conclave at Stead, Nevada. In 1996, it hosted the Section W3B Conclave at Naval Air Station Fallon and celebrated its 50th anniversary.

In 2005, Ross Armstrong from Tannu Lodge served as Western Region Chief for the Order of the Arrow. He received the Distinguished Service Award at the 2006 National Order of the Arrow Conference. In 2010, Armstrong publicly came out as gay and wrote about the BSA&#x27;s need to end the ban on gay Scouts and Scouters.

Tannu Lodge is a part of Section W-3B, which spans from Eureka down to Bakersfield, California.

===Snake River Council===

Snake River Council serves Scouts in Idaho, Nevada, and Utah.

==Girl Scouting in Nevada==

Four Girl Scout Councils serve Nevada. However Girl Scouts of Utah serves only the town of West Wendover, Nevada which is adjacent to Wendover, Utah.

===Girl Scouts of Southern Nevada===

Girl Scouts of Southern Nevada (formerly Frontier Council) serves more than 10,000 girls and adults in southern Nevada (Clark, Esmeralda, Lincoln, and Nye counties) and the southern part of Inyo County, California.

<text>Cornelius Crane &quot;Chevy&quot; Chase (; born October 8, 1943) is an American comedian, actor, and writer. He became the breakout cast member in the first season of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (1975–1976), where his recurring &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment became a staple of the show. As both a performer and a writer on the series, he earned two Primetime Emmy Awards out of four nominations.

After leaving &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; early in its second season, he established himself as a leading man, starring in some of the most successful comedy films of the 1980s, starting with his Golden Globe–nominated role in the romantic comedy &quot;Foul Play&quot; (1978). Most famously, he portrayed Ty Webb in &quot;Caddyshack&quot; (1980) and &quot;Caddyshack II&quot; (1988), Clark Griswold in five &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; films, and Irwin &quot;Fletch&quot; Fletcher in &quot;Fletch&quot; (1985) and &quot;Fletch Lives&quot; (1989). He also starred in &quot;Oh! Heavenly Dog&quot; (1980), &quot;Modern Problems&quot; (1981), &quot;Spies Like Us&quot; (1985) and &quot;¡Three Amigos!&quot; (1986).

He has hosted the Academy Awards twice (1987 and 1988) and briefly had his own late-night talk show, &quot;The Chevy Chase Show&quot; (1993). Chase had a popularity resurgence with his role as Pierce Hawthorne on the NBC sitcom &quot;Community&quot; (2009–2014).

== Early life and education ==
=== Family ===
Cornelius Crane Chase was born in Lower Manhattan on October 8, 1943, and grew up in Woodstock, New York. He has an older brother, Ned Jr.

His father, Edward Tinsley &quot;Ned&quot; Chase (1919–2005), was a Princeton-educated Manhattan book editor and magazine writer. Chase&#x27;s paternal grandfather was artist and illustrator Edward Leigh Chase, and his great-uncle was painter and teacher Frank Swift Chase. His mother, Cathalene Parker (née Browning; 1923–2005), was a concert pianist and librettist, whose father, Rear Admiral Miles Browning, served as Admiral Raymond A. Spruance&#x27;s Chief of Staff on the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; at the Battle of Midway in World War II. Cathalene was adopted as a child by her stepfather, Cornelius Vanderbilt Crane, heir to The Crane Company, and took the name Catherine Crane. Her mother, also named Cathalene, was an opera singer who performed several times at Carnegie Hall.

Chase was named for his adoptive grandfather, Cornelius, while the nickname &quot;Chevy&quot; was bestowed by his grandmother from the medieval English ballad &quot;The Ballad of Chevy Chase&quot;. As a descendant of the Scottish Clan Douglas, she thought the name appropriate. Chase is a 14th-generation New Yorker, and was listed in the &quot;Social Register&quot; at an early age. His mother&#x27;s ancestors arrived in Manhattan starting in 1624 — among those ancestors are:
* New York City mayors Stephanus Van Cortlandt and John Johnstone
* the Dutch Schuyler family, through his ancestor Gertrude Schuyler, the wife of Stephanus Van Cortlandt
* John Morin Scott, General of the New York Militia during the American Revolution
* Anne Hutchinson, dissident Puritan preacher and healer
* &quot;Mayflower&quot; passengers and signers of the Mayflower Compact from England, John Howland, and William Brewster, the Pilgrim colonist leader and spiritual elder of the Plymouth Colony

According to his step-brother John:

===Early life===
As a child, Chase vacationed at Castle Hill, the Cranes&#x27; summer estate in Ipswich, Massachusetts. Chase&#x27;s parents divorced when he was four; his father remarried into the Folgers coffee family, and his mother remarried twice. He has stated that he grew up in an upper middle class environment and that his adoptive maternal grandfather did not bequeath any assets to Chase&#x27;s mother when he died. In a 2007 biography, Chase stated that he was physically and psychologically abused as a child by his mother and stepfather, Dr. John Cederquist, a psychoanalyst. In that biography, he said, &quot;I lived in fear all the time, deathly fear.&quot; Abuse he was subjected to as a child included being awoken in the middle of the night by his mother to be slapped repeatedly across the face, lashes to the backs of his legs, punches to the head by his stepfather, and being locked in a bedroom closet for hours. As a punishment for being suspended from school at the age of 14, Chase was locked in a basement for several days. Both of his parents died in 2005.

Chase was educated at Riverdale Country School, an independent day school in the Riverdale neighborhood of The Bronx, New York City, before being expelled. He ultimately graduated as valedictorian in 1962 from the Stockbridge School, an independent boarding school in the town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts. At Stockbridge, he was known as a practical joker with an occasional mean streak. He attended Haverford College during the 1962–1963 term, where he was noted for slapstick comedy and an absurd sense of physical humor, including his signature pratfalls and &quot;sticking forks into his orifices&quot;. During a 2009 interview on the &quot;Today&quot; show, he ostensibly verified the oft-publicized urban legend that he was expelled for harboring a cow in his fourth floor room, although his former roommate David Felsen asserted in a 2003 interview that Chase left for academic reasons. Chase transferred to Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, where he studied a pre-med curriculum and graduated in 1967 with a Bachelor of Arts in English.

Chase did not enter medical school, which meant he was subject to the military draft. Chase was not drafted, and when he appeared in January 1989 as the first guest of the just-launched late-night &quot;The Pat Sajak Show&quot;, he said he had &quot;convinced&quot; his draft board he deserved a 4-F classification by &quot;&#x27;falsely&#x27; claiming, among other things, that he had homosexual tendencies&quot;.

He played drums with the college band The Leather Canary, headed by school friends Walter Becker and Donald Fagen. Chase has called the group &quot;a bad jazz band&quot;; Becker and Fagen later founded the successful group Steely Dan. Chase has perfect pitch. He played drums and keyboards for a rock band called Chamaeleon Church, which recorded one album for MGM Records before disbanding in 1969. To give the album a more soft-rock sound, producer Alan Lorber made several alterations in the mixing, including the muting of Chase&#x27;s bass drum, and Chase was reportedly incensed when he heard the final mix.

== Career ==
=== 1967–1974: Early career ===
Chase was a member of an early underground comedy ensemble called Channel One, which he co-founded in 1967. He also wrote a one-page spoof of &quot;&quot; for &quot;Mad&quot; magazine in 1970 and was a writer for the short-lived &quot;Smothers Brothers&quot; TV show comeback in the spring of 1975. Chase made the move to comedy as a full-time career by 1973, when he became a writer and cast member of &quot;The National Lampoon Radio Hour&quot;, a syndicated satirical radio series. &quot;The National Lampoon Radio Hour&quot; also featured John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Bill Murray, and Brian Doyle-Murray, all of whom later became the &quot;Not-Ready-For-Prime Time Players&quot; on &quot;NBC Saturday Night&quot; (later re-titled &quot;NBC&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot; and finally &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;). Chase and Belushi also appeared in National Lampoon&#x27;s off-Broadway revue &quot;Lemmings&quot;, a sketch and musical send-up of popular youth culture, in which Chase also played the drums and piano during the musical numbers. He appeared in the movie &quot;The Groove Tube&quot; (1974), which was directed by another co-founder of Channel One, Ken Shapiro, featuring several Channel One sketches.

=== 1975–1976: &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; ===

Chase was one of the original cast members of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;), NBC&#x27;s late-night comedy television show, beginning in October 1975. During the first season, he introduced every show except two, with &quot;Live from New York, it&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night!&quot;&quot; The remark was often preceded by a , known as &quot;The Fall of the Week&quot;. Chase became known for his skill at physical comedy. In one comedy sketch, he mimicked a real-life incident in which President Gerald Ford accidentally tripped while disembarking from Air Force One in Salzburg, Austria. This portrayal of President Ford as a bumbling klutz became a favorite device of Chase&#x27;s, and helped form the popular concept of Ford as being a clumsy man despite Ford having been a &quot;star athlete&quot; during his university years. In later years, Chase met and became friendly with President Ford.

Chase was the original anchor for the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment of &quot;SNL&quot;, and his catchphrase introduction, &quot;I&#x27;m Chevy Chase… and you&#x27;re not&quot; became well known. His trademark conclusion, &quot;Good night, and have a pleasant tomorrow&quot; was later resurrected by Jane Curtin and Tina Fey. Chase also wrote comedy material for &quot;Weekend Update&quot;. For example, he wrote and performed &quot;The News for the Hard of Hearing&quot;. In this skit, Chase read the top story of the day, aided by Garrett Morris, who repeated the story by loudly shouting it. Chase claimed that his version of &quot;Weekend Update&quot; was the inspiration for later news satire shows such as &quot;The Daily Show&quot; and &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;. &quot;Weekend Update&quot; was later revived as a segment on &quot;The Chevy Chase Show&quot;, a short-lived late-night talk show produced by Chase and broadcast by Fox Broadcasting Company.

Chase was committed contractually to &quot;SNL&quot; for only one year as a writer and became a cast member during rehearsals just before the show&#x27;s premiere. He received two Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award for his comedy writing and live comic acting on the show. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 &quot;SNL&quot; cast members to date, Chase was ranked tenth in overall importance. &quot;Strange as it sounds, Chase might be the most &quot;under&quot;-rated &quot;SNL&quot; player,&quot; they wrote. &quot;It took him only one season to define the franchise…without that deadpan arrogance, the whole &quot;SNL&quot; style of humor would fall flat.&quot;

In a 1975 &quot;New York&quot; magazine cover story, which called him &quot;The funniest man in America&quot;, NBC executives referred to Chase as &quot;The first real potential successor to Johnny Carson&quot; and claimed he would begin guest-hosting &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; within six months of the article. Chase dismissed rumors that he could be the next Carson by telling &quot;New York&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;d never be tied down for five years interviewing TV personalities.&quot; Chase did not appear on the program until May 4, 1977, when he was promoting a prime-time special for NBC. Carson later said of Chase: &quot;He couldn&#x27;t ad-lib a fart after a baked-bean dinner.&quot;

Chase acknowledged Ernie Kovacs&#x27;s influence on his work in &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and he thanked Kovacs during his acceptance speech for his Emmy Award. In addition, Chase spoke of Kovacs&#x27;s influence on his work in an appearance in the 1982 documentary called &quot;Ernie Kovacs: Television&#x27;s Original Genius&quot;.

=== 1976–1989: Film stardom and acclaim ===

In late 1976, in the middle of &quot;SNL&#x27;s&quot; second season, Chase became the first member of the original cast to leave the show. While he landed starring roles in several films on the strength of his &quot;SNL&quot; fame, he asserted that the principal reason for his departure was the reluctance of his girlfriend, Jacqueline Carlin, to move to New York. Chase moved to Los Angeles, married Carlin, and was replaced by Bill Murray, although he made a few cameo appearances on the show during the second season.

Chase hosted &quot;SNL&quot; eight times from 1978 to 1997. In regard to Chase&#x27;s 1997 appearance as a host, &quot;SNL&quot; creator and show-runner Lorne Michaels disputed reports that he was shocked by Chase&#x27;s behavior or had banned him as a result, claims which he calls &quot;idiotic&quot;. While Chase has not returned to &quot;SNL&quot; to host since 1997, he appeared on the show&#x27;s 25th anniversary special in 1999 and was interviewed for a 2005 NBC special on the first five years of &quot;SNL&quot;. Later appearances included a &quot;Caddyshack&quot; skit featuring Bill Murray, a 1997 episode with guest host Chris Farley, as the Land Shark in a &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment in 2001, another &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment in 2007, and in Justin Timberlake&#x27;s monologue in 2013 as a member of the Five-Timers Club, where he was reunited with his &quot;Three Amigos&quot; co-stars Steve Martin and Martin Short. He also participated in the 40th anniversary special in February 2015.
Chase&#x27;s early film roles included &quot;Tunnel Vision&quot; (1976); &quot;Foul Play&quot; (1978, a box-office hit that made more than $44 million and earned Chase a Golden Globe nomination); and &quot;Oh! Heavenly Dog&quot; (1980). The role of Eric &quot;Otter&quot; Stratton in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot; was written with Chase in mind, but he turned the role down to work on &quot;Foul Play&quot;. The role went to Tim Matheson instead. Chase said in an interview that he chose to do &quot;Foul Play&quot; so he could do &quot;real acting&quot; for the first time in his career instead of just &quot;schtick&quot;. 

Chase followed &quot;Foul Play&quot; in 1980 by portraying Ty Webb in the Harold Ramis comedy &quot;Caddyshack.&quot; A major box office success that pulled in $39 million off a $6 million budget, the movie has become a classic. It reached a 73% approval rate on Rotten Tomatoes, with critics saying: &quot;Though unabashedly crude and juvenile, Caddyshack nevertheless scores with its classic slapstick, unforgettable characters, and endlessly quotable dialogue&quot;. That same year, he reunited with &quot;Foul Play&quot; co-star Goldie Hawn for Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Seems Like Old Times,&quot; a box-office success that earned more than $43 million. He then released a self-titled record album, co-produced by Chase and Tom Scott, with novelty and cover versions of songs by Randy Newman, Barry White, Bob Marley, the Beatles, Donna Summer, Tennessee Ernie Ford, The Troggs, and The Sugarhill Gang.
Chase narrowly escaped death by electrocution during the filming of &quot;Modern Problems&quot; in 1980. During a sequence in which Chase&#x27;s character wears &quot;landing lights&quot; as he dreams that he is an airplane, the lights malfunctioned and an electric current passed through Chase&#x27;s arm, back, and neck muscles. The near-death experience followed the end of his marriage to Carlin, and Chase experienced a period of deep depression. He married Jayni Luke in 1982. Chase continued his film career by playing Clark Griswold in 1983&#x27;s &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation.&quot; Directed by Ramis and written by John Hughes, the movie grossed $61 million on a $15 million budget—his most successful movie at the time. 

In 1985, Chase played Irwin &quot;Fletch&quot; Fletcher in &quot;Fletch&quot;, based on Gregory Mcdonald&#x27;s &quot;Fletch&quot; books, which grossed more than $50 million off an $8 million budget. That same year, he appeared in a sequel to &quot;Vacation&quot;, &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s European Vacation&quot;, which pulled in just shy of $50 million at the box office, and co-starred with fellow &quot;SNL&quot; alum Dan Aykroyd in &quot;Spies Like Us&quot;, which made $60 million. In 1986, Chase joined &quot;SNL&quot; veterans Steve Martin and Martin Short in the Lorne Michaels–produced comedy &quot;¡Three Amigos!&quot; that made nearly $40 million, with Chase declaring in an interview that making &quot;Three Amigos&quot; was the most fun he had making a film. He also appeared alongside Paul Simon, one of his best friends, in Simon&#x27;s 1986 second video for &quot;You Can Call Me Al&quot;, in which he lip-syncs all of Simon&#x27;s lyrics.

In 1987, his Cornelius Productions company signed a non-exclusive, first-refusal deal to develop four feature projects at the Warner Bros. studio, and set up a fifth project at Universal Pictures. Chase hosted the Academy Awards in 1987 and 1988, opening the telecast in 1988 with the quip, &quot;Good evening, Hollywood phonies!&quot; In 1988, he starred alongside Madolyn Smith in &quot;Funny Farm,&quot; a sizeable hit at $25 million that reached 64% approval rate on Rotten Tomatoes. That same year, he appeared (albeit via a glorified cameo) in a sequel to &quot;Caddyshack&quot;, &quot;Caddyshack II&quot;, which made less than $12 million, becoming one of his few flops at the time.

In 1989, Chase starred in a sequel to &quot;Fletch&quot;, &quot;Fletch Lives&quot;, which went on to gross more than $35 million, and made a third &quot;Vacation&quot; film, &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot;, which pulled in $71 million and, thanks to its holiday theme, has become one of his more durable films. At the height of his career in the late 1980s, Chase earned around US$7 million per film and was a highly visible celebrity.

=== 1990–2009: Career fluctuations ===
Chase played saxophone onstage at Simon&#x27;s free concert at the Great Lawn in Central Park in the summer of 1991. Later in 1991, he helped record and appeared in the music video &quot;Voices That Care&quot; to entertain and support U.S. troops involved in Operation Desert Storm, and supported the International Red Cross. Chase had three consecutive film flops: Razzie Award-nominated &quot;Nothing but Trouble&quot; (1991), &quot;Memoirs of an Invisible Man&quot; (1992), and &quot;Cops &amp; Robbersons&quot; (1994). The three releases had a combined gross of $34 million in the United States. 

In September 1993, Chase hosted &quot;The Chevy Chase Show&quot;, a weeknight talk show, for the Fox Broadcasting Company. Although it had high commercial expectations, the show was cancelled by Fox after five weeks. Chase later appeared in a commercial for Doritos, airing during the Super Bowl, in which he made humorous reference to the show&#x27;s failure.

Chase found success with some of his subsequent movies. &quot;Man of the House&quot; (1995), co-starring Farrah Fawcett, was relatively successful, grossing $40 million, and &quot;Vegas Vacation&quot; (1997, his fourth &quot;Vacation&quot; film) was a box office success, grossing $36.4 million. &quot;Snow Day&quot; (2000), in which Chase appeared, was also successful grossing over $60 million, as well as &quot;Orange County&quot; (2002), grossing more than $40 million. Chase was Hasty Pudding&#x27;s 1993 Man of the Year, and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in that same year. He also received &quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot;″s Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996. In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.

He was roasted by the New York Friars Club for a Comedy Central television special in 2002. This roast was noted for being unusually vitriolic, even by the standards of a roast. Some of the more recent films starring Chase (e.g., &quot;Vacuums&quot;, &quot;Rent-a-Husband&quot;, &quot;Goose!&quot;) have not been widely released in the United States. He returned to mainstream movie-making in 2006, co-starring with Tim Allen and Courteney Cox in the comedy &quot;Zoom&quot;, though it was both a critical and commercial failure. Chase guest-starred as an anti-Semitic murder suspect in &quot;In Vino Veritas&quot;, the November 3, 2006, episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. He also guest-starred in the ABC drama series &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot; in two episodes as a former love interest of Sally Field&#x27;s character. Chase appeared in a prominent recurring role as villainous software magnate Ted Roark on the NBC spy-comedy &quot;Chuck&quot;. In 2009, Chase and Dan Aykroyd voiced themselves in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Spies Reminiscent of Us&quot;.
=== 2009–2014: Return to television ===
Starting in 2009, Chase returned to NBC in the sitcom &quot;Community&quot;, as aging moist-towelette tycoon Pierce Hawthorne. The show was created by Dan Harmon and starred Joel McHale, Alison Brie, Gillian Jacobs, Donald Glover, Danny Pudi, and Yvette Nicole Brown. The series received critical acclaim for its acting and writing, appeared on numerous critics&#x27; year-end &quot;best-of&quot; lists and developed a cult following. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Alessandra Stanley praised the casting of Chase writing, &quot;Jeff has the kind of sardonic repartee and slapdash nonchalance that the comedian Chevy Chase had when he was the young star of the ’Fletch’ movies,&quot; while adding, &quot;Even that is an inside casting joke: Mr. Chase, who is farcically loopy and delightful in the pilot.” 

In 2010, Chase appeared in an online &quot;Vacation&quot; short film &quot;Hotel Hell Vacation&quot;, featuring the Griswold parents, and in the &quot;Funny or Die&quot; original comedy sketch &quot;Presidential Reunion&quot;, where he played President Ford alongside other current and former &quot;SNL&quot; president impersonators. That same year, Chase appeared in the film &quot;Hot Tub Time Machine&quot; which received some praise, and a &quot;sequel&quot;.

Throughout the filming of &quot;Community&quot; seasons one through four, Chase became increasingly angry and uncomfortable with the direction of his character, Pierce, who is a bigot.
It was reported that in 2012 Chase &quot;snapped and launched the tirade, airing his frustration and suggesting that the way things with Pierce are going, he may next be asked to call Troy (Glover) or Shirley (Brown) the N-word&quot;. While Chase apologized for his outburst, he proceeded to leave the show due to increasing disagreements with his character and the show&#x27;s creator Dan Harmon. After a mutual agreement with the network, his character was abruptly written out of the fourth season of &quot;Community&quot;. Chase later claimed that his exit was due to his personal opinions of the show rather than the outburst, claiming that it &quot;wasn&#x27;t funny enough&quot;. His departure was cemented by the writers, who made the creative decision to kill off Pierce in the third episode of &quot;Community&quot;&#x27;s fifth season.

=== 2015–present ===
In 2015, Chase reprised his role as Clark Griswold in the fifth &quot;Vacation&quot; installment, titled &quot;Vacation&quot;. Unlike the previous four films in which Clark is the main protagonist, he only has a brief though pivotal cameo appearance. In spite of largely negative critical reception, the film proved to be a financial success, grossing over $107 million worldwide.

In 2019, Chase was in the Netflix movie &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; where he starred alongside Richard Dreyfuss, and in 2024, he was in the film &quot;The Christmas Letter&quot; with Randy Quaid and Brian Doyle-Murray.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriage and family ===
Chase married Susan Hewitt in New York City on February 23, 1973. They divorced on February 1, 1976. His second marriage, to Jacqueline Carlin, was formalized on December 4, 1976, and ended in divorce on November 14, 1980; they had no children. 

Chase resided in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles from 1980 until 1995 in a Tudor-style home. He was the Honorary Mayor of Pacific Palisades between 1986 and 1988.

He married his third wife, Jayni Luke, in Pacific Palisades on June 19, 1982. He and Luke have three daughters, Cydney, Caley, and Emily. The couple reside in Bedford, New York.

=== Substance abuse ===
In 1986, Chase was admitted to the Betty Ford Center for treatment of a prescription painkiller addiction. His use began after he experienced ongoing back pain related to the pratfalls he took during his &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; appearances. In 2010, he said that his drug abuse had been &quot;low level.&quot; 

He entered the Hazelden Clinic in September 2016 to receive treatment for alcoholism.

=== Political views ===
An active environmentalist and philanthropist, Chase is a political liberal. He campaigned for Bill Clinton in the 1990s, and for John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election. 

In 2004, he mocked President George W. Bush during a speech at a People for the American Way benefit at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where he referred to Bush as an &quot;uneducated, real lying schmuck&quot; and a &quot;dumb fuck&quot;, which upset the organizers and the crowd, leading Norman Lear to categorize the statements as &quot;utterly untoward.&quot;

=== Fight with Bill Murray ===
While filming an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1978, Chase got into a fistfight with Bill Murray in John Belushi&#x27;s dressing room. Murray and Chase&#x27;s backstage brawl took place when Chase returned to host the show after his exit as a full-time cast member in 1976. Murray had reportedly made a derogatory comment about Chase&#x27;s troubled marriage to Jacqueline Carlin, leading Chase to criticize Murray&#x27;s physical appearance. &quot;SNL&quot; cast members Jane Curtin, Laraine Newman, and Gilda Radner witnessed the incident.

In a talk show appearance in 2021, Newman noted of the altercation, &quot;it was very sad and painful and awful&quot;. She went on to say, &quot;I think they both knew the one thing that they could say to one another that would hurt the most and that&#x27;s what I think incited it.&quot; Chase and Murray would later reconcile to star together in &quot;Caddyshack&quot; in 1980.

<text>Scouting in New Mexico has had a rich and colorful history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live. The state is home to the Philmont Scout Ranch.

== Early history (1910–1950) ==

On May 11, 1941, the Boy Scouts of America honored Major Frederick Russell Burnham on his eightieth birthday, at Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico. Burnham had only recently returned from Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge which he had dedicated with the Boy Scouts in Arizona after a long campaign to save the Desert Bighorn Sheep.

In 1918, the Albuquerque Council (#412) was founded. It changed its name to the Bemalillo County Council (#412) in 1926. The council changed its name again in 1927 to the Rio Grand Area Council (#412). In 1934, the Rio Grande Area Council became the Northern New Mexico Council (#412).

In 1920, the Carlsbad Council and the Roswell Council (#413) were founded. They merged in 1924 to become the Pecos Valley Council (#413). In 1925, the Pecos Valley Council became the Eastern New Mexico Council (#413).

In 1927, the Gila Grande Council (#579) was formed, merging with the El Paso Area Council (#573) in 1930.

In 1927, the Kit Carson Council (#574) was formed, merging with the Rio Grande Council (#412) in 1929.
==Recent history (1950–1990)==
In 1955, the Northern New Mexico Council (#412) became the Kit Carson Council (#412). The council changed its name in 1976 to the Great Southwest Area Council, and again in 1982 to the Great Southwest Council (#412).

The Ta Tsu Hwa Lodge (#138) was formed in 1938 under the name of &quot;Yaqui&quot;. In 1957 Yaqui Lodge merged with the Checote Lodge (#154) due to the merger of the Tulsa Area Council and the Creek Nation Council, creating the Indian Nations Council. The new lodge was named the &quot;Daw Zu&quot; Lodge (#138). In 1959 the lodge was renamed &quot;Ta Tsu Hwa,&quot; meaning &quot;Red Bird&quot;. Between 1959 and the present day, the Lodge absorbed the &quot;Oskihoma&quot; Lodge (#320) and the &quot;Ni-U-Kon-Ska&quot; Lodge (#328) as the Indian Nations Council absorbed the Choctaw Area Council and the Eastern Oklahoma Council.

=====Order of the Arrow=====
MaNu Lodge No. 133 was originally chartered to the Central Oklahoma Area Council, Region 9 on August 20, 1938. One year later the Central Oklahoma Area Council rechartered as Last Frontier Council. This makes MaNu Lodge one year older than Last Frontier Council. Over the next few decades there would be several mergers and reorganizations within the structure of both the Lodge and the Council.

As the area of the lodge expanded, the lodge began to need another form of organization. In 1963, MaNu lodge set up Chapters with borders corresponding to the districts established by the Council. In 1950, Canadian Valley Council merged with Last Frontier Council and Shawnee Lodge 192 became part of MaNu Lodge 133. Again in 1996 Black Beaver Council merged with Last Frontier Council and two years later Sekettummaqua Lodge 281 completed its merger with MaNu bringing the number of members to near 1700 and the total number of Chapters to ten.

Today, the lodge has experienced a myriad of growth and development and continues to tweak its organizational structure to better meet the demands of today&#x27;s program. There are currently seven Lodge Officers: The Lodge Chief; The Lodge Vice Chief of Program; The Lodge Vice Chief of Activities; The Lodge Vice Chief of Chapters; The Lodge Vice Chief of Inductions, The Lodge Vice Chief of Finance, The Lodge Vice Chief of Administration. There are also numerous Associate Lodge Advisers.

*Special Note: Although the literal translation of MaNu is White Buffalo, the Osage word for white also meant Spirit, so MaNu means Spirit Buffalo.

==History==
In 1932, the Mount Saint Helens Council (#704) merged with the Portland Area Council.

=== Organization ===
* Spirit Lake District (serving the Southern Washington Area)

* Cascadia District (serving Portland)
* Rivers&#x27; Edge District (serving Newberg, Sherwood, and Canby)
* Santiam River District (serving the Greater Salem area)

=== Camps ===
The council operates a number of camps, including;

* Camp Baldwin, 680 acre property west of Dufur in the Mount Hood National Forest
* Butte Creek Scout Ranch, a 670-acre working horse ranch south of Scotts Mills
**Butte Creek Scout Ranch is a working ranch that doubles as a Cub Scout resident camp. Consisting of over 600 acres nestled near Scotts Mills, the property first opened as a summer camp in 1997. During the summers, it is a 3-day and 2-night camp for Cub Scouts ages 5–10. Unlike other resident Cub camps in the council, the Butte Creek Scout Ranch has a Western theme every year. This property is one of the few scout camps that includes a horse riding station and is home to cows, goats, chickens, and sometimes pigs. The Butte Creek Ranch was also the first camp in the council to start a session for girls in the same age group. Originally started in 2007, the program was called &quot;Sisters&#x27; Camp&quot; and had the purpose of providing Cub Scout sisters with a similar experience to their brothers. Since 2019 the program serves girls and boys together during all summer sessions. The summer staff is primarily high school students. The property also doubles as the winter location for the council&#x27;s 70+ head of horses. Twice a year, June and August, 50 of the horses are ridden between Camp Baldwin and Butte Creek along a beautiful route over Mount Hood. The Horse Trek is open to anyone over 13, although Scouts receive a discount. During the winter, Scouts participate in weekend horseback riding and camping on the property. The winters are staffed by a diverse group of volunteers who run rides and help maintain the property.
* Camp Clark, a second camp on the Meriwether Reservation near Tillamook
* Camp Cooper, 240 acres property northwest of Willamina in the coastal forest
* Camp Ireland, 12-acre property in Hillsboro that has been shut down due to lack of scout registration. This is because a majority of cub scouts attending were mormon, and the camp shut down after Mormons stopped endorsing BSA.

* Nanitch Lodge, a winter recreation lodge on 8 acres of property leased from the US Forest Service

<text>James Walter Carter (December 15, 1923, in Aiken, SC – September 21, 1994) was a world lightweight boxing champion three times between 1951 and 1955. His managers included Jimmy Roche and Willie Ketchum. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2000. Carter&#x27;s loss to Lauro Salas in 1952 and his loss to Paddy DeMarco in 1954 were each named Ring Magazine upset of the year. His professional record was 80-31-9 with 32 knockouts.

==Early life==
James Walter Carter was born on December 15, 1923, in Aiken, South Carolina, but his family moved to New York when he was nine. Carter began to use his fists defending himself on the streets of Harlem, but later received training at a Catholic Boys Club, making his amateur debut at the age of fourteen. Beginning as a professional fighter in New York in 1946, he won 22 of his first 26 fights.

==First taking the World Lightweight Championship, May 1951==

On May 25, 1951, Carter took the World Lightweight Championship from reigning champion Ike Williams in a fourteenth-round TKO at Madison Square Garden. Williams was down in the fifth, tenth, and fourteenth rounds. Carter knocked Williams to the mat a total of four times, and was leading the scorecards of all three officials before the bout was stopped. In the fifth round, Williams was dropped to the canvas for a five count, and never was the same. Surprisingly, Carter was not at all well known at the time of the bout, and his victory was considered an upset.

In his first title defense before 7,251 fans on November 14, 1951, he went up against Art Aragon at the Olympic Stadium in Los Angeles, winning in a fifteen-round unanimous decision. Aragon was down in both the sixth and fifteenth rounds, but claimed after the fight that a left to his jaw in the twelfth is what finally did him in. It was an easy win for Carter, as Aragon lacked the skills to take down the world champion. Aragon took a severe beating in the last four rounds that sealed the victory for Carter. Carter had oddly lost to Aragon on August 28 of that year in a fifteen-round split decision at the same location. Some boxing writers speculated he may have thrown the fight on purpose. Some even believed Carter was controlled by mafia kingpin Frankie Carbo.

He lost the title on May 14, 1952, against Lauro Salas at the Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles in a fifteen-round split decision that was a jarring upset for many. The decision was a controversial one, and many boxing writers disagreed with the official&#x27; final ruling for Sales.

==Taking the World Lightweight Championship for the second time, October 1952==
Carter took the World Lightweight Championship for a second time on October 15, 1952, against Mexican national Lauro Salas in a fifteen around unanimous decision at the Chicago Stadium before a small crowd of 5,283. In a sweeping victory, which saw far more damage to Salas, the officials gave all but two of the rounds to Carter and his terrific left hook.

On April 24, 1953, he staged a title defense against Tommy Collins before a substantial crowd of 12,477 at Boston Garden, winning in a fourth-round TKO. Collins&#x27; corner men ended the fight after their boxer had been knocked to the canvas ten times in the final two rounds. Both the TV audience and the crowd, who were largely fans of Collins, protested the continuation of such a brutal, and one sided bout. He next fought George Araujo on June 12, 1953, in a lightweight world title bout at Madison Square Garden, winning in a thirteenth-round TKO.
On March 5, 1954, Carter lost his second World Lightweight Championship against Paddy DeMarco in a fifteen-round unanimous decision at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. DeMarco, a 4–1, underdog won the decision with ease rocking the crowd of 5,730 with a remarkable upset. Carter tried for a knockout throughout the bout, but DeMarco scored continuously with fleet footwork and a punishing left. Both judges gave DeMarco nine rounds, with the referee giving him seven.

==Taking the World Lightweight Championship for third and final time, November 1954==
On November 17, 1954, Carter took the lightweight championship back from Paddy DeMarco in a fifteen-round TKO at the Cow Palace, in Daily City, California. DeMarco was down in the ninth and fourteenth rounds. Carter had lost his title to DeMarco only seven months earlier.

Carter lost the title for the last time to Wallace &quot;Bud&quot; Smith at Boston Garden in a fifteen-round split decision on June 29, 1955. Though the bout was close, Carter took one of the worst beatings of his career from Smith requiring fifteen stitches over his eyes. Smith himself needed three stitches to fix a cut over his own eye. The crowd of only 1,983 saw a razor close, hotly contested title match. Two of the officials gave a margin of only one point between the two boxers.

Carter died of a heart attack on September 21, 1994, at the age of 70.

<doc id="102980" wikidata="Q2916869" url="?curid=102980" title="Garrett Morris">
<text>Garrett Isaac Morris (born February 1, 1937) is an American actor, comedian and singer. He was part of the original cast and was the first black cast member of the sketch comedy program &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, appearing from 1975 to 1980. 

He also played Jimmy on &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; (1983–1984). Morris had one of the starring roles, as Junior &quot;Uncle Junior&quot; King, on the sitcom &quot;The Jamie Foxx Show&quot;, which aired from 1996 to 2001. Morris also had a starring role as Earl Washington on the CBS sitcom &quot;2 Broke Girls&quot;, from 2011 to 2017. 

He is also known for his role in the sitcom &quot;Martin&quot; as Stan Winters, from 1992 to 1995, until he suffered an injury. Also, he made two guest appearances on &quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot; in season one, episode one as himself and again on episode ten as the brothers&#x27; uncle Leon (1995). He played a concerned teacher in the film &quot;Cooley High&quot; (1975), Slide in &quot;Car Wash&quot; (1976), and Carl in &quot;The Census Taker&quot; (1984).

In 2024, Morris was honored with his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life &amp; Education==
Morris was born on February 1, 1937, in New Orleans, Louisiana, and grew up in the poverty-stricken Gert Town neighborhood. A church-choir singer from his youth, he trained at the Juilliard School of Music and graduated from Dillard University in 1958. Early in his career, he performed with The Belafonte Folk Singers. In 1960, Morris recorded &quot;South African Freedom Songs&quot; (EPC-601) with Pete Seeger and Guy Carawan for Folkways Records.

==&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;==
Morris had written a play that Lorne Michaels read and liked, which got Morris hired on as a writer for a program he was developing for Saturday night. Morris was asked about bringing in black actors to potentially serve as cast members, such as asking Bill Duke. Duke wasn&#x27;t cast, but a suggestion by ones who were cast led Michaels to view a film that had Morris in it, &quot;Cooley High&quot;, which Morris later stated &quot;played a hand&quot; in getting him cast on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, as produced by Michaels. 

Periodically on &quot;SNL&quot; he sang classical music: once a Mozart aria &quot;Dalla Sua Pace&quot;, Don Ottavio&#x27;s aria from &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; when guest-host Walter Matthau designated him as a &quot;musical guest...in place of the usual crap&quot;, and once a Schubert &quot;lied&quot; while the titles on the screen expressed his colleagues&#x27; purported displeasure at having to accommodate a misguided request by him. In February 1977, he sang Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt&quot; barefoot in colorful Caribbean dress while subtitles explained he had just returned from Jamaica where he had picked up a girl by claiming to be Harry Belafonte.

One of Morris&#x27; best known characters on &quot;SNL&quot; was the Dominican baseball player Chico Escuela. Chico spoke only limited and halting English, so the joke centered on his responding to almost any question with his catch phrase: &quot;Baseball... been berra berra good... to me&quot;. Another recurring bit, used in the newscast segment &quot;Weekend Update&quot;, involved Morris being presented as &quot;Headmaster of the New York School for the hard of hearing&quot; and assisting the newscaster by shouting the main headlines, in a parody of the then-common practice of providing sign language interpretation in an inset on the screen as an aid to the deaf viewer.

According to the book &quot;Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live&quot;, Morris was frequently unhappy during his tenure on &quot;SNL&quot; from 1975 to 1980, and expressed the opinion that he was usually typecast in stereotypical roles. In 2024&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, directed by Jason Reitman, which dramatically details &quot;SNL&quot;&#x27;s opening night, Morris&#x27;s restless unhappiness is portrayed by actor Lamorne Morris (no relation).

Black performers who have followed Morris on &quot;SNL&quot; have at times been publicly concerned with experiencing the same fate Morris did. Eddie Murphy, for example, told &quot;TV Guide&quot; in the early 1980s that &quot;SNL&quot; producer Jean Doumanian &quot;had tried to Garrett Morris me&quot;.

Morris, then at 38, was the eldest of the original cast members when SNL debuted in 1975. As such, he is also the eldest surviving cast member.

===Recurring characters===
* Chico Escuela, a Dominican baseball player for the New York Mets
* Cliff, the streetwise friend to the Festrunk Brothers (Dan Aykroyd and Steve Martin)
* Grant Robinson, Jr., one of The Nerds
* Hodo, one of Miles Cowperthwaite&#x27;s cronies
* Merkon, the leader of the Coneheads
* &quot;Weekend Update&quot;&#x27;s &quot;News for the Hard of Hearing&quot; translator, who simply repeated each line while shouting with his hands cupped around his mouth.

==Career==

=== Theater ===

He performed in a number of Broadway musicals, including &quot;Hallelujah, Baby!&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Supposed to Die a Natural Death&quot;. In 1965, he worked alongside Amiri Baraka, Sun Ra, Albert Ayler and Sonia Sanchez at the Black Arts Repertory Theatre/School in Harlem; during this period, the theater was frequently raided and surveilled by the New York City Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 

=== Television ===

In 1971, he had a small role as a police sergeant in &quot;The Anderson Tapes&quot; and was a cast member in the short-lived CBS sitcom, &quot;Roll Out&quot;. He also appeared as a high school teacher in the 1975 film &quot;Cooley High&quot;. In 1976, Morris appeared in the film &quot;Car Wash&quot;, playing the role of Slide the bookmaker. In 1983 and 1984, Morris appeared in five episodes of &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, playing a character named Jimmy. He starred in the 1984 film &quot;The Census Taker&quot;, a 1984 black comedy directed by Bruce R. Cook.

In 1985, he guested on &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; as Lafayette Duquesne. In 1986, Morris began playing Arnold &quot;Sporty&quot; James, on the NBC cop drama &quot;Hunter&quot;, starring Fred Dryer and Stepfanie Kramer through 1989. Morris appeared in &quot;Married... with Children&quot; as Russ, one of Al&#x27;s poker buddies, in &quot;The Poker Game&quot;, in a 1987 season 1 episode and again in the season 3 episode &quot;Requiem for a Dead Barber&quot;. He also appeared in the 1992 horror comedy &quot;Severed Ties&quot; starring Oliver Reed.

Morris also had regular roles on &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, &quot;227&quot;, and &quot;Roc&quot;. He also appeared in an episode of &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss&quot;, &quot;Sam&#x27;s Car&quot; (1989), playing the role of Officer Audette. He was a regular cast member on &quot;The Jamie Foxx Show&quot;, playing Jamie&#x27;s uncle, Junior King.

In 1998, Morris appeared as himself in the fourth episode of the fifth season of the TV series, &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;. In 2002, Morris made a cameo appearance on an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; hosted by Brittany Murphy. In 2006, Morris reprised his role as &quot;Headmaster of the New York School for the Hard of Hearing&quot; in a cameo on the TV series &quot;Family Guy&quot;, in the episode &quot;Barely Legal.&quot;

In August 2008, Morris played the role of Reverend Pratt in the family comedy drama film, &quot;The Longshots&quot;, starring Ice Cube and Keke Palmer.

In 2011, Morris had a cameo role as a Catholic priest on the episode &quot;Three Boys&quot; on the Showtime series &quot;Shameless&quot;. He was cast as Earl in the CBS comedy &quot;2 Broke Girls&quot;, which premiered on September 19, 2011. During the second season he faced a lawsuit from the Global Agency accusing him of not paying 10% of his income from the show as agreed. However, a rep from the show stated that he had not actually failed to do so. 

In 2018, Morris appeared in the NBC show &quot;This Is Us&quot;. In 2019, Morris appeared in the fifth episode of &quot;A Black Lady Sketch Show&quot;, titled &quot;Why Are Her Pies Wet, Lord?&quot;

=== Mugging ===

In 1994, he was shot by a would-be robber, whom he attempted to fight off, but recovered as he discussed on the January 14, 2016, episode of Marc Maron&#x27;s podcast &quot;WTF&quot;. On Howard Stern&#x27;s radio show on July 20, 1995, Morris said the culprit was imprisoned not for the shooting, but for parole violations for other crimes. In another radio interview, he mentioned that the robber who shot him was eventually convicted and incarcerated. In prison, inmates who happened to be fans of Morris teamed up and beat up the robber in revenge.

At the time of the shooting, Morris was starring on &quot;Martin&quot; as Martin&#x27;s first boss, Stan Winters. Morris&#x27; shooting rendered him temporarily unable to continue in the role; he was written out of the show by having the character become a national fugitive. The scene where he is about to undergo plastic surgery was shot on the hospital bed Morris occupied while recuperating from the 1994 assault. He made a final appearance as Stan during the show&#x27;s third season, walking with a cane due to Morris&#x27; real injuries, but the reason given for Stan was that he had crashed his car during a police chase.

=== Film ===

In 1985, he appeared in Larry Cohen&#x27;s science fiction horror film &quot;The Stuff&quot;, playing cookie magnate Chocolate Chip Charlie, a parody of Famous Amos. In 2015, Morris appeared as a cameo in &quot;Ant-Man&quot;, referencing an old &quot;SNL&quot; sketch in which he played the first live-action incarnation of the character.

=== Commercials ===

In 2009, Morris appeared in two TV commercials for the Nintendo DS—one featuring &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot;, and the other featuring &quot;Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!&quot;. In 2010, Morris appeared in a television commercial for Miller Lite. The national commercial, titled &quot;PopPop&quot;, features Morris alongside actors Stacey Dash and Jason Weaver. The commercial takes a light-hearted look at a family relationship with Morris playing the grandfather, PopPop, and Weaver as his grandson. , Morris has appeared in an ad for Orbit gum in the United States. 

He also operated and was the host of his own comedy club, The Downtown Comedy Club, in downtown Los Angeles. On February 9, 2007, Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa honored Garrett Morris for his work and contributions to the black community. He declared February 9, 2007, Garrett Morris Day and named The Downtown Comedy Club the official club of Los Angeles. 

=== Other career endeavors ===

On September 9, 2016, Morris and his family appeared on the ABC&#x27;s game show &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot;, playing against Alfonso Ribeiro and Ribeiro&#x27;s friends.

In 2024, Morris was honored with his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
