<text>Supergirl is the name of several fictional superheroines appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The original, current, and most well known Supergirl is [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]], the cousin of superhero Superman. The character made her first appearance in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #252 (May 1959) and was created by Otto Binder and Al Plastino.

==Concept==
Created as a female counterpart to Superman, Kara Zor-El shares his superpowers and vulnerability to Kryptonite. Supergirl plays a supporting role in various DC Comics publications, including &quot;Action Comics&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, and several comic book series unrelated to Superman. In 1969, Supergirl&#x27;s adventures became the lead feature in &quot;Adventure Comics,&quot; and she later starred in an eponymous comic book series which debuted in 1972 and ran until 1974, followed by a second monthly comic book series, &quot;The Daring New Adventures of Supergirl&quot;, which ran from 1982 to 1984. Supergirl was originally introduced in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #252 as the cousin of the publisher&#x27;s flagship superhero, Superman in the story &quot;The Supergirl from Krypton&quot;. In most depictions, she is an alien from the planet Krypton, possessing a multitude of superhuman abilities derived from the rays of a yellow sun. Other mainstream characters have taken the name Supergirl over the years, with decidedly non-extraterrestrial origins, such as that of a superhuman artificial life-form. The 2016 miniseries &quot;Supergirl: Being Super&quot; written by Mariko Tamaki and penciled by Joelle Jones is a coming-of-age take on Supergirl&#x27;s origins. It depicts Kara as a seemingly ordinary teenager living in the rural Midvale with the Danvers, since the couple found her inside a pod in the middle of a field. Kara grows up aware of the pod and her unknown origins (which are glimpsed in dreams) and struggles to live a normal life as she discovers her abilities, which she keeps a secret even from her closest friends.

Because of changing editorial policy at DC, Supergirl was killed off in the 1985 event &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. DC Comics subsequently rebooted the continuity of the DC Comics Universe, re-establishing Superman as the sole survivor of Krypton&#x27;s destruction. Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;, several characters unrelated to Superman assume the role of Supergirl, including Matrix, Linda Danvers, and Cir-El. Following the cancellation of the third &quot;Supergirl&quot; comic book series (1996–2003), which starred the Matrix/Linda Danvers version of the character, a modern version of Kara Zor-El was reintroduced into the DC Comics continuity in &quot;Superman/Batman&quot;. This modern Kara Zor-El stars as Supergirl in an eponymous comic book series and additionally in a supporting role in various other DC Comics publications.

Since her initial comic book appearances, the character later branched out into animation, film, television, and merchandising. In May 2011, Supergirl placed 94th on IGN&#x27;s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time. In November 2013, the character placed 17th on IGN&#x27;s list of the Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics.

==Precursors==

*Superwoman – The first comic ever to feature a female counterpart to Superman is &quot;Lois Lane – Superwoman&quot;, a story published in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #60 (May 1943), in which a hospitalized Lois dreams she has gained Kryptonesque superpowers thanks to a blood transfusion from the Man of Steel. She begins her own career as Superwoman, complete with copycat costume. Similar stories with Lois Lane acquiring such powers and adopting the name &quot;Superwoman&quot; periodically appeared later. One such story is in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #156 (May 1951), in which Lois accidentally gains those powers through an invention of Superman&#x27;s arch-foe, Lex Luthor. In the story, Lois wears a short blond wig in her crime-fighting identity, giving her an appearance almost identical to the later version of Supergirl after the latter&#x27;s real name was specified as Kara Zor-El.
*Supergirl – In &quot;Superboy&quot; #5 (November–December 1949) in a story titled &quot;Superboy Meets Supergirl&quot;, Superboy meets Queen Lucy of the fictional Latin American nation of Borgonia. She is a stellar athlete and scholar. Tired of her duties and wanting to enjoy a normal life, Queen Lucy travels to Smallville, where she meets Superboy and soon wins his heart. Superboy puts on a show with her where he uses his powers to make her seem superhuman; during this contest, she is called Supergirl. As Supergirl, Queen Lucy wears a tan dress with a brown cape and Superboy&#x27;s &quot;S&quot; symbol. Superboy later saves her from a scheming minister. She returns to her throne, leaving Superboy to wonder if she ever thinks of him.
*Super-Sister – In the &quot;Superboy&quot; #78 story titled &quot;Claire Kent, Alias Super-Sister&quot;, Superboy saves an alien woman named Shar-La from a life-threatening crash. After he ridicules her driving, Shar-La turns Superboy into a girl. In Smallville, Clark Kent (Superboy&#x27;s alter ego) claims to be Claire Kent, an out-of-town relative who is staying with the Kents. When in costume, he plays Superboy&#x27;s sister, Super-Sister, and claims the two have exchanged places. As a girl ridiculed and scorned by men, he wants to prove he is as good as he always was. In the end, it is revealed that the transformation is just an illusion created by Shar-La. Superboy learns not to ridicule women.
*Super-Girl – In &quot;Superman&quot; #123 (August 1958), Jimmy Olsen uses a magic totem to wish a &quot;Super-Girl&quot; into existence as a companion and helper for Superman; however, the two frequently get in each other&#x27;s way until she is fatally injured protecting Superman from a Kryptonite meteor that a criminal has dropped towards him. At her insistence, Jimmy wishes the dying girl out of existence. DC used this story to gauge public response to the concept of a completely new female counterpart to Superman. In the original issue, she has blond hair and her costume is blue and red like Superman&#x27;s; indeed, it closely resembles the uniform that actress Helen Slater would later wear in the 1984 movie. Early reprints of this story show her with red hair and an orange and green costume to prevent readers from confusing her with the then current Supergirl character. Much later, the story was again reprinted in its original form.

==Original character: Kara==
===Debut===
After positive fan reaction to Super-Girl, the first recurring and most familiar version of Supergirl debuted in the year 1959. Kara Zor-El first appeared in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #252 (May 1959). The story that introduced the character was drawn by Al Plastino and written by Otto Binder. Like Supergirl, Mary Marvel was a teen-age female version of an adult male superhero, wearing a costume that was identical to the older character&#x27;s other than substituting a short skirt for tight trousers. (Binder also created Marvel Comics&#x27; Miss America, a superhero who shared little other than the name with her sometime co-star Captain America.)

Reaction to Supergirl&#x27;s first appearance was tremendous, with thousands of positive letters pouring into the DC Comics offices.

Issue #8 of the &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; series originally published in 2004 re-introduced Kara Zor-El into the DC continuity. Like the pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; version, this Kara claims to be the daughter of Superman&#x27;s uncle Zor-El and aunt Alura In-Ze. Unlike the traditional Supergirl, Kara is born before Superman; she is a teenager when he is a baby. She is sent in a rocket in suspended animation to look after the infant Kal-El; however, her rocket is caught in the explosion of Krypton and becomes encased in a Kryptonite asteroid. She arrives on Earth years after Kal-El, who has grown and become known as Superman. Owing to this extended period of suspended animation, she is &quot;younger&quot; than her cousin. At the end of &quot;The Supergirl from Krypton&quot; arc, Superman officially introduces her to all the heroes of the . She adopts the Supergirl costume and accepts the name.

A new &quot;Supergirl&quot; series, written by Jeph Loeb, began publication in August 2005. The storyline in the first arc of &quot;Supergirl&quot; depicts a darker, evil version of Kara emerging when Lex Luthor exposes her to Black Kryptonite. The evil Supergirl implies that Kara&#x27;s family sent her to Earth to kill Kal-El as revenge for a family grudge. At the time, Kara herself refuses to believe this, but later flashbacks indicate that not only is this partly true, but Kara had been physically altered by her father as a child before being involved in several murders on Krypton. However, these matters were later revealed to be delusions as a result of Kryptonite poisoning. Upon being cured, she presents a personality more like that of her Silver Age persona.

===Biography===

Kara Zor-El (so named because on Krypton, women take the full name of their fathers) is the last survivor of Argo City, which had survived the explosion of the planet Krypton and drifted through space. The city had been covered by a plastic dome for weather moderation, devised by Zor-El, the younger brother of Jor-El, a climatologist and engineer, the father of Superman (Kal-El). The dome held together a large chunk of land mass under the city as it drifted through space in the general direction of our Solar System. The land is converted into green kryptonite, which is covered with lead. However, the lead covering is destroyed in a meteor strike, forcing Kara to be sent to Earth.

It is later revealed that Zor-El and Alura survived by entering the Survival Zone, a parallel continuum akin to the Phantom Zone. They are rescued by Supergirl and move to the bottle city of Kandor. In the New Krypton storyline, the two are killed by Reactron.

On Earth, Kara acquires powers identical to Superman&#x27;s and adopts the secret identity of Linda Lee, a resident of Midvale Orphanage. She conceals her blonde hair beneath a brunette wig and functions as Supergirl only in secret, at Superman&#x27;s request, until she can gain, in his opinion, sufficient control of her powers — and the wisdom to properly use them. Her debut was delayed by her powers being stolen by a Kandorian villainess; during this period, she is adopted by Fred and Edna Danvers.

She attends Midvale High School as Linda Danvers. In later years, after graduating from Stanhope College, she changes careers several times, holding jobs in student counseling, news reporting, and acting in a TV soap opera, &quot;Secret Hearts&quot; (a play on the DC romance comic of the same name). She also attends college in Chicago. Kara has many boyfriends, including Richard (Dick) Malverne, Jerro the Merboy from Atlantis, and Brainiac 5, a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes. However, she has shunned serious commitments, placing her super-career first.

Supergirl&#x27;s secret identity is a closely held secret known only to Superman, her foster parents, and the Legion of Super-Heroes, of which she is a member for a time. Like all Kryptonians, Supergirl is vulnerable to kryptonite. Streaky the Supercat, her orange cat, acquires temporary superpowers as a result of its exposure to &quot;X-kryptonite,&quot; a form of kryptonite Supergirl accidentally created in an unsuccessful attempt to neutralize the effects of green kryptonite. Comet, a former centaur, is Supergirl&#x27;s equine companion.

One way DC demonstrated the epic nature of its 12-issue limited series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; (April 1985 – March 1986) was through the deaths of important characters. In issue #7 (October 1985), Supergirl sacrifices herself to save her cousin and the multiverse. When the Superman continuity was rebooted after &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, DC editors felt that Superman should be the sole survivor of Krypton, resulting in Kara being removed. Unlike a number of other characters who are shown dying in the Crisis, no one remembers Kara dying or having existed.

After the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, many historical events from the Multiverse are now being remembered. Donna Troy, after her rebirth and inheritance of the Harbinger&#x27;s Orb, recalls the original Kara Zor-El and her sacrifice.

A Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Supergirl appears in &quot;Supergirl and the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;, in which she is transported to the 31st century and, as a result of her disorientation, for a time believes she is dreaming her surroundings into existence until finally convinced otherwise. Although her memories of her time with the Legion are erased before she returns to the present, the mental blocks break down upon encountering the pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; versions of Karate Kid and Triplicate Girl.

Supergirl exhibits new powers, manifesting sunstone crystals from her body; so far, she only does so while under great stress (for example, when Cassandra Cain tries to kill her). Supergirl&#x27;s father implants the crystals within his daughter&#x27;s body to protect her from malevolent beings from the Phantom Zone. The Zone dwellers are released when Jor-El creates the Phantom Zone Projector and exploits the Zone as a prison. Kara&#x27;s father, believing that Kal-El is a lure to the Zone denizens, instructs Kara to destroy him. More recent comics have cast this plotline as the result of kryptonite poisoning from the kryptonite asteroid in which she was trapped.

A recently completed storyline focused on her promise to a little boy that she would save him. She tries to make good on her promise, following different avenues searching for a cure for his cancer. After he died, she tracks down a villain with the ability to jump through time, but decides not to use that solution, as she would just be doing the same thing as the villain. She accepts that sometimes she cannot save everyone.

As part of &quot;The New 52&quot;, Kara&#x27;s origin was rebooted once again. An amnesiac Kara awakens after her lifepod crashes to Earth in the midst of a meteor shower. Upon emerging, she encounters humans and the extent of her powers for the first time. When encountered by Superman, she attacks him, believing him to be an impostor as her cousin was only a baby when she last saw him and she believed it to only have been a few days since then. After several battles with supervillains, including the Worldkillers, superweapons of Kryptonian design, she accepts Krypton&#x27;s destruction, but continues to grapple with her grief. Her desire to restore Krypton results in her being manipulated into nearly destroying Earth by another Kryptonian whom she falls in love with. Upon realizing his manipulation, she kills him by driving kryptonite through his heart and succumbs to kryptonite poisoning.

Following her poisoning, Supergirl departs Earth to die alone. While adrift in interstellar space, she encounters a planet under attack by monsters and she intervenes to save them, unaware that the entire planet is a trap by Brainiac. She is captured and restrained by the Cyborg Superman, but after a struggle, she manages to escape. Returning to Earth, she is sent into the past by the Oracle alongside Superman and Superboy, where she ensures that a resurrected H&#x27;el cannot save Krypton. She sacrifices the planet and her family in order to save the universe.

Back on Earth, she is attacked by the assassin Lobo and, in the ensuing battle, kills him while unleashing her rage. A Red Lantern power ring finds her and attaches itself to her, transforming her into a Red Lantern. Driven insane by rage, Kara wanders through outer space, attacking everyone in her way, until captured by several Green Lanterns and brought to Hal Jordan. Immediately recognizing a Kryptonian and unable to remove the power ring without killing her, he brings her to Guy Gardner, the leader of one of the two Red Lantern factions, who manages to restore her sanity. After some time under Gardner&#x27;s tutelage and protecting the galaxy as a Red Lantern, she is discharged from the Red Lantern Corps, as Guy did not want her to die needlessly fighting against Atrocitus&#x27; splinter group. On her way back to Earth, Kara encounters the leader of the Worldkillers, who are revealed to be parasitic suits of armor. He attempts to assimilate Kara as his host, but she voluntarily subjects herself to kryptonite poisoning in order to stop him and eventually flies into the Sun and removes her power ring, killing her and removing him from her body. However, Kara is revealed to be immortal while in the Sun&#x27;s core and she is restored to life without the power ring or any kryptonite poisoning, immediately destroying the Worldkiller. She later helps Gardner against Atrocitus and his Red Lantern splinter group.

==Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; versions==
DC Editorial wanted Superman to be the only surviving Kryptonian following DC&#x27;s Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; reboot of the Superman continuity. As a result, when DC reintroduced Supergirl, she needed a non-Kryptonian origin. Afterward, DC Comics tried to revamp the Supergirl concept, introducing several more non-Kryptonian Supergirls. Eventually, the rule that Superman should be the only Kryptonian survivor was relaxed, allowing for a return of Kara Zor-El as his cousin.

===Matrix===
After the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; reboot in the late 1980s, Supergirl&#x27;s origin was completely rewritten and no longer was she Superman&#x27;s cousin or even Kryptonian. In &quot;Superman&quot; (vol. 2) #16 (April 1988), a new Supergirl debuted as a man-made lifeform made of synthetic protoplasm created by a heroic Lex Luthor of a &quot;pocket continuum&quot;. She wears a miniskirted version of Superman&#x27;s costume, but does not have Superman&#x27;s exact powers. While she can fly and possesses super-strength (like Superman), she also has psychokinesis, shapeshifting, and invisibility.

The Matrix&#x27;s Supergirl form resembles the Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Supergirl and new to Earth, Matrix begins a romance with the DC Universe&#x27;s Lex Luthor (known as Lex Luthor II), until she realizes Luthor&#x27;s villainous nature in replicating her for an army. She leaves him to find her own way in the world aiding Superman more and more and even living in Smallville with the Kents, who treated &quot;Mae&quot; like their own daughter. Supergirl then began serving for a time as a member of the Teen Titans and central hero in her own right, participating in events such as &quot;Panic in the Sky&quot;, and &quot;Death and Return of Superman&quot;.

===Matrix/Linda Danvers===

Beginning in September 1996, DC published &quot;Supergirl&quot; (vol. 4) written by Peter David. The 1996 &quot;Supergirl&quot; comic book revamped the previous Matrix Supergirl by merging her with a human being, resulting in a new Supergirl. Many elements of the Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Supergirl were incorporated in new ways. The woman that the Matrix merges with has the same name as the Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Supergirl&#x27;s secret identity, Linda Danvers. The series is set in the town of Leesburg, named after Danvers&#x27; pre-adoption surname. Linda&#x27;s father is named Fred Danvers, the same as the Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Supergirl&#x27;s adopted father. Furthermore, new versions of Dick Malverne and Comet appear as part of the supporting cast.

As the series begins, the Matrix sacrifices herself to save a dying Linda Danvers and their bodies, minds and souls merge to become an &quot;Earth-Born Angel&quot;, a being created when one being selflessly sacrifices him or herself to save another who is beyond saving. As the angel, Supergirl loses some of her powers, but gains others, including fiery angel wings and a &quot;shunt&quot; ability that allows her to teleport to any place she has been before.

The angelic aspect of Supergirl eventually falls from grace, and Linda and the Matrix are separated into two beings. Linda retains some of Supergirl&#x27;s super-strength and durability and, although she can no longer fly, she can leap one-eighth of a mile. Linda acts as Supergirl for a while, attempting to locate her angelic aspect. After she is found in the Garden of Eden and freed from the Demon Mother, the Matrix merges with a woman named Twilight and becomes the new Earth-Born Angel of Fire. Twilight uses her healing powers to increase Linda&#x27;s strength to Supergirl&#x27;s level and restores her powers of flight and telekinesis. In &quot;Supergirl&quot; (vol. 4) #75 (December 2002), detoured on her way to Earth, Kara Zor-El, the Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Supergirl, arrives in Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Leesburg. After learning that Kara is destined to die, Linda travels to the Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; universe in her place, where she marries Superman and gives birth to a daughter named Ariella. With the stipulation that her daughter be the exception in the eradication of her alternate &quot;life&quot;, Linda ultimately allows history to unfold as it should have, with Kara assuming her rightful but tragic place in the timestream. However, finding no assurance that Ariella survived the restoration of Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; history, a dejected Linda relinquishes the role of Supergirl, sends a farewell note to Superman, and leaves for points unknown.

Peter David&#x27;s creator-owned series &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, published by DC Comics, is set in a fictional city named Bete Noire, and features a character, Lee, who is similar to Linda and explores the same themes as his Supergirl series. Prior to &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; moving to another company, Lee was written in a manner such that she could have been Linda, though David remained coy as to whether the two characters were one and the same during the DC run of the title. After it moved to IDW, David revealed Lee&#x27;s origin, which clearly showed that Lee was not Danvers. However, &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; #14 introduced &quot;Lin&quot;, who was said to be Lee&#x27;s &quot;predecessor&quot; as the guardian of Bete Noire. Lin had recently escaped Limbo, an apparent metaphor for what happened to Danvers after the cancellation of &quot;Supergirl&quot;. David wrote in his December 13, 2006, blog entry, &quot;Any fans of my run on Supergirl—particularly those who are torqued because Linda Danvers was consigned to oblivion in the DCU--must, must, MUST pick up &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; #14 and #15 when they come out next year.&quot; However, since David could not explicitly claim that a character owned by DC was the same as the character he owned, he stated, &quot;Can I say this is Linda Danvers? Of course I can&#x27;t. However, it&#x27;s pretty freaking obvious that it is.&quot;

According to an interview with Newsarama, the Matrix Supergirl is wiped from existence by the events depicted in the 2005 limited series &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, although &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; writer Geoff Johns later stated that Danvers is not. The debate was finally settled in the 2008 miniseries &quot;Reign in Hell&quot;, where the Shadowpact is shown trying to apprehend Linda Danvers before Linda is &quot;recalled&quot; to Hell.

===Cir-El===

A Supergirl named Cir-El appeared in 2003&#x27;s &quot;Superman: The 10 Cent Adventure&quot; #1, claiming to be the future daughter of Superman and Lois Lane. Although she has super-strength, speed and hearing like Superman, she can only leap great distances. She also possesses the ability to fire blasts of red solar energy. Her alter ego is a street person named Mia. She is later found to be a human girl who was altered by Brainiac on a genetic level to appear Kryptonian; she dies thwarting a plot involving Brainiac 13. &quot;Superman&quot; (vol. 2) #200 implies that when the timeline realigned itself, Cir-El was erased from existence.

==Supporting characters==
Even though Supergirl is a Superman supporting character, she is also a Superman Family member, with her own set of supporting characters.

*Zor-El and Alura  – Kara Zor-El&#x27;s biological parents. Zor-El, the younger brother of Jor-El, is a scientist who invents the dome over Argo City and oversees the placement of lead shielding over the ground of Argo, thus enabling the city&#x27;s residents to survive the explosion of Krypton. The city drifts in space for about 15 years, the residents clinging to a precarious existence. During that time, the couple have a daughter, Kara, who grows to about the age of 10 or 12, when the city is put in peril when its lead shielding is punctured by meteors, releasing deadly Kryptonite radiation. At this point, Zor-El and Alura In-Ze place Kara in a rocket ship and send her to Earth, which Zor-El had observed using a powerful electronic telescope. Observing a super-powered man resembling his brother Jor-El, and wearing a uniform of Kryptonian styling, Zor-El and his wife conclude the man is probably their nephew, Kal-El, sent through space by Jor-El when Krypton exploded and now grown to adulthood. In later Silver Age accounts, Zor-El and Alura survive the death of Argo when, shortly before the radiation reached lethal levels, Zor-El projects them both into the Survival Zone, a separate dimension resembling the Phantom Zone; later they are released from the Zone and go to live in the bottle city of Kandor.
*Streaky – Supergirl&#x27;s pet cat. In the pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity, he is named after a jagged horizontal stripe of lighter fur on his side, and acquires super-powers after exposure to X-Kryptonite. In post-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity, she is a normal housecat Supergirl takes in, whose name is taken from her inability to understand the concept of a litterbox.
*Comet – Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Supergirl&#x27;s horse is a centaur accidentally cursed by Circe into being trapped in the form of a horse. In post-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity, Comet is a superhero who is a romantic interest of Linda Danvers.
*Fred and Edna Danvers – The foster parents of pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Supergirl. Shortly after they adopt Linda Lee from the Midvale orphanage, Superman reveals his cousin&#x27;s identity to them, so they are aware of her powers. Later, they also learn that Superman is secretly Clark Kent.
*Dick Malverne – An orphan at the Midvale Orphanage who is one of pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Supergirl&#x27;s romantic interests. While living at the orphanage as Linda Lee, Supergirl meets and befriends a fellow orphan, Dick Wilson. Dick suspects that Linda is secretly Supergirl and constantly tries to prove it. Later, Dick is adopted by a couple named Malverne, and changes his name to Dick Malverne. In the post-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity, Dick Malverne is a newly arrived resident of Leesburg who befriends Linda Danvers.
*Jerro the Merboy – A merperson from Atlantis who is another of pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Supergirl&#x27;s romantic interests. Superman has a similar relationship with mermaid Lori Lemaris.
*Lena Thorul – Another orphan at the Midvale Orphanage who is one of Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Supergirl&#x27;s/Linda Lee Danvers&#x27;s best friends. Lena is unaware that she is the long lost younger sister of Lex Luthor. When Lena was still a small child and Lex was a teen, Lex turned evil after the laboratory accident he blamed on Superboy turned him bald. Lex&#x27;s parents disowned him and told him to leave home. In order to prevent disgrace to Lena, they moved away from Smallville and told Lena that her brother had been killed in a mountain climbing accident. They changed their family name to Thorul, an anagram of Luthor. Eventually Lena&#x27;s parents were killed in a car accident and Lena was sent to Midvale Orphanage. A childhood accident while playing in her brother Lex&#x27;s laboratory empowered Lena with extrasensory perception.
*Siobhan Smythe - Kara&#x27;s best friend who mistook her for an enemy. They both bonded and later battled Siobhan&#x27;s father, the Black Banshee.

* Laurel Gand (Andromeda) – Laurel Gand was the post-&quot;Crisis&quot;/Glorithverse replacement for the pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Supergirl in the Legion of Super-Heroes after the latter was removed from the continuity following &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; reboot of Superman. Originally, Laurel is simply known by her given name. A younger version of Laurel takes the superhero codename &quot;Andromeda&quot; shortly before the Zero Hour reboot of the Legion; post-reboot, Laurel remains Andromeda.
* Ariella Kent – Supergirl of the 853rd century, later revealed to be the daughter of post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Linda Danvers and Silver Age style Superman from the Many Happy Returns story arc.

=== Alternate universe versions ===

In the final issue of DC Comics&#x27; 2006-07 year-long weekly series, &quot;52&quot; #52, it was revealed that a Multiverse system of 52 parallel universes, with each Earth being a different take on established DC Comics characters as featured in the mainstream continuity (designated as &quot;New Earth&quot;) had come into existence. The Multiverse acts as a storytelling device that allows writers to introduce alternative versions of fictional characters, hypothesize &quot;what if?&quot; scenarios, revisit popular Elseworlds stories and allow these characters to interact with the mainstream continuity.

*In &quot;52&quot; Week 52 (2007), the new Earth-2 is revealed and a newspaper headline declares that the Power Girl (and Superman) of this Earth are officially missing. On this world, Power Girl fights alongside Huntress (Helena Wayne), Obsidian, Robin and others in the Justice Society Infinity. In &quot;Justice Society of America Annual&quot; #1, this world&#x27;s native Power Girl re-emerges. In a subsequent reiteration of Earth-2 after the events of Flashpoint, Power Girl had a prior career on Earth-2 as that world&#x27;s Supergirl before she and Earth-2&#x27;s former Robin, Helena Wayne, were displaced onto Earth-0 after inadvertently entering a dimensional warp. They resided there for seven years until both returned. 
* Following &quot;52&quot; (2007), on the evil parallel universe of Earth-3, a mirror of the Earth-2 Kara Zor-L exists in the form of Ultragirl, first introduced in &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot; #16 (2007). Unlike Ultraman, the Superman counterpart of Earth-3, this version of Supergirl is in fact vulnerable to kryptonite and not powered by it, implying she may be of Kryptonian origin. Following &quot;Flashpoint&quot; (2011), Earth-3 is an evil world once again most closely mirroring Earth-0. Ultraman is once again a Kryptonian, but a new Ultragirl has not yet been introduced.
*On Earth-10, Nazi Germany won World War II and that world&#x27;s Superman, named Overman, is a part of the JL-Axis. That world&#x27;s Supergirl was called Overgirl. She is first seen as a sketch made by exiled Monitor Nix Uotan in &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #2. She makes a full appearance in #3, where she crash lands in a burning heap on New Earth. There, she tells Renee Montoya, in German, that the sky is bleeding. She is not Overman&#x27;s actual cousin, rather she is the only child who survived the horrible experiments the Nazis conducted when they tried to seed a human child with Overman&#x27;s DNA. She has less than half of Overman&#x27;s strength, speed, stamina and endurance, which is still considerable (however, this is subsequently modified after the events of Flashpoint impact the Multiverse-she is now a female clone of Overman, produced from his stem cells). She died in &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #7. In &quot;The Multiversity - Mastermen #1&quot; (February 2015), Overman is still mourning her loss, six years after her death, as he opens a memorial to his fallen cousin in Metropolis. His lover Lena (Earth-10&#x27;s Lana Lang) criticizes his prolonged mourning, as does the Valkyrie Brunnhilde (Earth-10&#x27;s Wonder Woman). 
*Earth-11 is first featured in &quot;The Search for Ray Palmer - Superwoman/Batwoman&quot; (2007), and is a gender-reversed mirror of New Earth. While not featured in the pages of the comic itself, male Supergirl, or Power Girl counterparts may inhabit this Earth. The previous gender-reversed world featured in &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; #24 (2006) featured a male Kara Zor-El counterpart known as Superlad In the subsequent and current &quot;Multiversity Guidebook&quot; (January 2015), Power &quot;Man&quot; is described as existing on this Earth, although not depicted.
*In Mark Waid and Alex Ross&#x27; &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; miniseries, Power Woman is Superman&#x27;s cousin and a member of Superman&#x27;s Justice League. This world is currently assigned the designation of Earth-22. However, a Supergirl appears with the Legion of Super-Heroes alongside Superboy in one panel, with dialogue implying they settled in the future permanently as the 21st-Century became difficult to live in. A brief line of dialogue from Superman implies that Argo City was never destroyed in this continuity, as he left some of the defeated Brainac’s circuitry there. According to Ross, a minor character in the story is the time-traveling daughter of Supergirl and Brainiac 5.
* In the Tangent Comics imprint (established as Earth-97 prior to Infinite Crisis, now known as Earth-9 post-&quot;52&quot;), Powergirl is a genetically engineered superheroine created by the Chinese government. Supergirl was an unsuccessful prototype.
* On New 52 DC Multiverse Earth-29, a Bizarro-Supergirl imperfect abiotic alternate version of the Kryptonian original exists. As with that world&#x27;s Bizarro-Superman, it is uncertain whether they are native to Earth-29/Htrae, or arrived there from Krypton-29/Notpyrk.
*On New 52 DC Multiverse Earth-38, Supergirl is Kara Kent, the daughter of Superman and Lois Lane on an alternate Earth where Superman and Batman began their careers in the 1930s, married in the 1940s and had children in the 1950s. Unlike other iterations, she masks her actual identity by wearing a black wig as Supergirl, with her normal blonde hair as Kara. Unlike other iterations too, she is not a refugee evacuated from Krypton or Argo City. Given prenatal exposure to gold kryptonite in utero, her brother Joel Kent is jealous of his sister and that leads him to eventually murder his mother Lois Lane and Kara/Supergirl during her wedding to Bruce Wayne Junior/Batman II.
*In &quot;Supergirl&quot; vol. 5 #32, Supergirl is shown 50 years in the future. She has a modified costume that is similar to her Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;, original uniform. Here, she is seen fighting Dorlok, a man with a device that allows him to jump through time. In the end Supergirl, after contemplating using the device, destroys it and moves on.
*In the &quot;Trinity&quot; series, reality is rewritten and Superman is removed from existence. In this alternative timeline, Kara Zor-El is known as &quot;Interceptor&quot; and has no knowledge of her Kryptonian heritage. Her ship was found by the Navy, but apparently no investigation took place.
*In &quot;Legends of the DC Universe: Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Earth D is introduced as a previously unknown Pre-Crisis alternate Earth. In this reality, the heroes of the DC Universe are more ethnically diverse. Supergirl of Earth D is still named Kara, but she is married to Earth D&#x27;s Superman. From Krypton&#x27;s Vathlo Island, she and her husband resemble African-Americans. Along with her husband and the other members of Earth D&#x27;s Justice Alliance of America, she was killed during the Crisis as antimatter storms consumed their Earth. 
*In the &quot;Ame-Comi&quot; imprint, both a Supergirl and a Power Girl exist together. In this universe, Supergirl is still Kara Zor-El, while Power Girl is actually the equivalent of Superman — her name is Kara Jor-El, and she is the daughter of Jor-El and cousin of Kara Zor-El. According to Supergirl, Jor-El and Zor-El destroyed Krypton intentionally as part of a failed attempt to destroy Brainiac, after sending both their Karas to Earth. Brainiac later reaches Earth and uses black kryptonite to turn Supergirl evil. Unusually for most depictions of Kryptonians, this Power Girl claims her powers do not come from the Sun.
*In the 2015 &quot;DC Bombshells&quot; iteration, Supergirl, Wonder Woman and Batwoman all exist in an alternate history version of World War II, independently of their male counterparts in the case of Batwoman and Supergirl In this continuity, Kara Zor-El was born to Lara Lor-Van and Alura In-Ze was found in her spaceship by Russian farmers Varvara Dugina and Ipati Dugan, who raised her with their daughter, Kortni Dugiovna. The two sisters became best of friends and in their teens traveled to Moscow to join the legendary Night Witches, an all-female fighter squadron, but became Russian mascots after their powers were discovered. They abandon Russia when they find out the general intended to use them for his own destructive means and join the Bombshells team to aid in defeating the Nazis. When Brother Night turns into the Titan, Supergirl volunteers to sacrifice herself to defeat the monster, but Stargirl knocks her out and does it instead, saving Britain and devastating Supergirl in the process. Kara becomes romantically involved with Lois Lane in this universe.
*The 2016 miniseries &quot;Supergirl: Being Super&quot; written by Mariko Tamaki and penciled by Joelle Jones is a coming-of-age take on Supergirl&#x27;s origins, depicting Kara as a seemingly ordinary teenager living in the rural Midvale with the Danvers, since the couple found her inside a pod in the middle of a field. Kara grows up aware of the pod and her unknown origins (which are glimpsed in dreams) and struggles to live a normal life as she discovers her astonishing super-human abilities, which she keeps a secret even from her closest friends.
*In the world of &quot;Gotham City Garage&quot;, Kara Zor-El was adopted by James Gordon and becomes Kara Gordon, Barbara&#x27;s adoptive sister and a ridealong technician.
*In Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, Superman and Wonder Woman hide their daughter Lara from the world her entire life, but she later becomes important to the defeat of Lex Luthor and Brainiac, the story&#x27;s antagonists. Lara possesses some of Wonder Woman&#x27;s powers, benefiting from both a Kryptonian and an Amazonian heritage as that universe&#x27;s Supergirl.
*In Kurt Busiek&#x27;s &quot;&quot; miniseries, which depicts a Clark Kent who lives in the real world, Lois gives birth to two girls who grow up to manifest their father&#x27;s powers and adopt variations on his costume.
*&quot;Elseworld&#x27;s Finest: Supergirl &amp; Batgirl&quot; depicts a Barbara Gordon/Kara Zor-El team in a world without their male counterparts. In another story that took place in this reality as seen in &quot;Superboy&quot; (vol. 3) #61, there is a female equivalent to the Conner Kent Superboy named Supergrrl. This Supergrrl is a clone of Supergirl, only aged at sixteen or so, who was created by that world&#x27;s Lex Luthor.
*&quot;Supergirl: Wings&quot; reworks the Earth-born angel storyline with Zauriel as her companion; in it, Linda&#x27;s guardian angel is Matrix, whose cynical view of her charge may lead to her fall.
*In the &quot;Superman/Aliens&quot; crossover limited series, published in 1995 by DC Comics and Dark Horse Comics, Superman discovers a domed city on an asteroid, not unlike the Argo City of the pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Supergirl&#x27;s origins, that is infested with the xenomorphs. Superman befriends the sole survivor, a plucky 16-year-old girl named Kara. The story reveals that Kara is not Superman&#x27;s cousin, and that the colony is not Kryptonian, but is instead part of a world whose culture and religion were strongly influenced by Krypton.
*In &quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations&quot;, Superman&#x27;s young daughter, Kara Kent, takes up the identity of Supergirl and forms a new Justice League with Bruce Wayne Jr., Wally West, and Stephanie Trevor. As they grow up, Kara and Bruce Jr. fall in love, becoming a couple in &quot;civilian&quot; life and a crime-fighting duo as Superwoman and Batman. The two eventually marry, but their happiness barely lasts beyond the ceremony when Kara&#x27;s elder brother Joel attacks the wedding reception. The jealous Joel, who grew up without superpowers due to exposure to gold kryptonite as a fetus, was manipulated by Lex Luthor into striking against his family with artificial superpowers bestowed by a formula Luthor created; he leads Kara away from the reception and kills her in a rage, but dies himself from the deliberately imperfect serum that Luthor gave him.
:In &quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations 3&quot;, Knightwing (Joel&#x27;s son Clark, whose Kryptonian genes were activated by a perfected version of Luthor&#x27;s serum) and his wife have twin daughters, Lois and Lara, who take the heroic identities of Supergirl Red / Supergirl Blue. Supergirl Blue gives up her powers in the 25th century so she can age normally, but uses Luthor&#x27;s serum in the 26th century to restore them. Supergirl Red is killed the same century, leaving her sister as the last Supergirl. Supergirl Blue dies in the 30th century. When Darkseid is destroyed, she is erased from the timeline.
*In &quot;&quot;, Linda Danvers, fifteen years after the Fall (a population destroying plague that killed all males), changes her name to Superwoman.
*In &quot;&quot;, Linda Danvers is one of many metahumans who loses her powers due to the Black Light event that strips the entire metahuman community powerless. However, she, along with the Martian Manhunter, Aquaman and the Flash, trains with Batman and his associates so they may still be heroes. Changing her name to Justice, Linda and the others form the &quot;Phoenix Group&quot;.
* In &quot;Superman/Gen13&quot;, Caitlin Fairchild of Gen13 had received a bump on the head and suffered amnesia. When she awoke, she found Superman&#x27;s cape draped over her and assumed that, with her super powers, she was Supergirl. She believed that she could not fly due to exposure to red kryptonite which, at the time, was only considered an urban legend. After going through multiple Supergirl outfits and generally causing more havoc than good, she was found by the other Gen13s and Superman when the real Supergirl knocked her out. When Caitlin awoke, she regained her memory.
* Supergirl is shown in &quot;Justice&quot; with other heroes helping the Justice League in their confrontation against the Legion of Doom. Since the continuity resembles the Silver Age and she is wearing a variation of her 70s era costume, this Supergirl is most likely Kara Zor-El.
* Supergirl made a brief appearance in &quot;&quot; when all time periods meld together. She is presumably Kara Zor-El, since she is wearing a costume identical to her first appearance in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #252.
* In &quot;DC Comics Bombshells&quot;, set in an alternate history 1940, Supergirl and Stargirl are both Soviet pilots in the Night Witches, a nod to &quot;&quot;.
*Kara Zor-El appears in the six-issue mini series &quot;Supergirl: Cosmic Adventures in the 8th Grade&quot;. The series features elements from all aspects of Supergirl continuity, but is written with a more tongue-in-cheek tone for young readers. In this series, Kara is designed as a typical teenager from Krypton&#x27;s moon, Argo, who (unintentionally) ends up on Earth and meets up with her cousin, Superman. With his help, Kara is given a cover identity as Linda Lee and is enrolled in school. Over the course of the series, Kara befriends a local student named Lena Thorul (who, ironically, is actually Lex Luthor&#x27;s sister (her last name is an anagram of “Luthor”)), deals with her own &quot;Bizarro&quot; self, Belinda Zee and ultimately gets drawn into the reality-conquering schemes of Mr. Mxyzptlk.
**An alternative version of Kara is accidentally created when she gains time travel powers in order to prevent a meteor from hitting the school. This version of Kara is called Supragirl (after wanting to be called &quot;Andromeda&quot;).
*Supergirl appears in the &quot;Tiny Titans&quot; comic book. Due to her pets Krypto, Streaky, Comet and Beppo appearing, this Supergirl is probably Kara Zor-El. She is portrayed as giggly and kind. She is shown to fly everywhere giving her character a sense of innocence. She is very smart, gaining A&#x27;s and &#x27;super&#x27; comments from her supervillain teachers. Batgirl and Robin are shown as two of her closest friends in the book; they all attend pet club together. Batgirl and Supergirl spend time together without the other Titans by having picnics. 
*Supergirl appears in the comic crossover &quot;Justice League vs. Godzilla vs. Kong&quot; in which and the Justice League deals with Godzilla, King Kong and other monsters from the Monsterverse unleashed into the DC Universe. Supergirl is brainwashed by Grodd but later breaks where she helps defeat an rebuilt Mechagodzilla.

===Film===
Producer Ilya Salkind originally wrote a treatment for the third installment from the &quot;Superman&quot; film series starring Christopher Reeve that expanded the film&#x27;s scope to a cosmic scale, introducing the villains Brainiac and Mister Mxyzptlk, as well as Supergirl. The original outline featured a father–daughter relationship between Brainiac and Supergirl and a romance between Superman and Supergirl, even though the two are cousins in the comics. Warner Bros. rejected the outline.

*The first live-action depiction of Supergirl was in the eponymous 1984 film, starring Helen Slater as Kara Zor-El / Linda Lee / Supergirl. The film is a spinoff from the Salkind &quot;Superman&quot; film series, to which it is connected by Marc McClure&#x27;s character, Jimmy Olsen. Its plot, which connects more traditionally to the comics than Salkind&#x27;s outline, concerns Supergirl, Superman&#x27;s cousin, leaving her isolated Kryptonian community of Argo City for Earth in an effort to retrieve the unique &quot;Omegahedron&quot;, which has fallen into the hands of the evil witch Selena (Faye Dunaway). The film was poorly received and did poorly at the box office and no reference to the character was made in the subsequent &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot;.
* In August 2018, a film centered around Kara Zor-El / Supergirl, was announced to be in development with Oren Uziel penning the script. The studio intends to hire a female director, with Reed Morano—who has expressed interest in the project—being its top choice. Filming was expected to start production in early 2020.
*In February 2021, Colombian-American actress Sasha Calle was cast as Supergirl in &quot;The Flash&quot; (2023), directed by Andy Muschietti. In February 2023, it was confirmed Calle would be portraying the Kara Zor-El version of the character
* In January 2024, Milly Alcock was cast in the role of Kara Zor-El / Supergirl who is set to debut in &quot;Superman&quot; before her set in the DC Universe, which would derive significantly from the &quot;&quot; (2021–22) miniseries by writer Tom King and artist Bilquis Evely.

===Television===
====Live-action====
* In the seventh season (2007–2008) of the CW&#x27;s hit show &quot;Smallville,&quot; Kara is introduced into the cast and was portrayed by Laura Vandervoort. &quot;Smallville&quot; depicts her as Clark&#x27;s (Tom Welling) cousin, whose spacecraft became trapped in stasis until the events of the sixth season finale, when the destruction of the dam the ship had landed near disrupted the stasis systems and allowed Kara to wake up. Much of season seven is concerned with Kara&#x27;s attempts to adjust to life on Earth, especially after learning of Krypton&#x27;s destruction and the fact that her &quot;younger&quot; cousin is now at least the same age as she. She makes guest appearances in season eight and in the show&#x27;s tenth and final season, in which she becomes a Justice League member. In the season finale, she is sent into the future by the artificial intelligence of the Fortress of Solitude so that Clark can realize destiny and defeat Darkseid alone.
*A television series centered around the Kara Zor-El version of Supergirl, set in the shared universe Arrowverse, titled &quot;Supergirl&quot; starring Melissa Benoist as Kara Danvers, premiered on CBS on October 26, 2015, before later moving onto The CW on May 12, 2016. In the series, Kara was sent to Earth-38 to protect her cousin Kal-El although her pod got knocked off course and became stranded in the Phantom Zone for 24 years. Eventually, Kara crashes on Earth-38 where she is rescued by an adult Kal, who is now the iconic superhero &quot;Superman&quot;. Superman leaves Kara in the care of the Danvers family who decides it best to hide her abilities from the world. Twelve years later, Kara is a reporter for Cat Co Worldwide Media. She eventually decided to reveal her powers to the world by saving her adoptive sister Alex Danvers from a near plane crash and is dubbed &quot;Supergirl&quot; by Cat Grant. With the help of Department of Extra-Normal Operations (D.E.O.) director Hank Henshaw who was later revealed as J&#x27;onn J&#x27;onzz / Martian Manhunter, her best friends Winn Schott and [[List of Supergirl characters#James Olsen / Guardian|James Olsen / Guardian] and her adopted sister Alex Danvers,Kara fights aliens and prisoners of fort rozz,led by her evil aunt Astra, and her husband non, who attempted to invade Earth. She is later joined by [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]]’s sister [[Lena Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lena]], the Daxamite [[Mon-El (Arrowverse)|Mon-El]], [[Querl Dox (Arrowverse)|Querl Dox]],(Brainiac-5) and [[Nia Nal|Nia Nal / Dreamer]] in fighting enemies such as Mon-El&#x27;s parents, the World Killers [[Reign (Arrowverse)|Reign]], ,alien activist [[Ben Lockwood (Arrowverse)|Ben Lockwood / Agent Liberty]] and the evil secret organisation Leviathan, in collaboration with led Luthor.

====Animation====
* Supergirl was voiced by [[Nicholle Tom]] in &quot;&quot;, an American television show. She is depicted as Kara In-Ze, not Superman&#x27;s cousin as in the comic book, but rather a near-Kryptonian from Krypton&#x27;s sister planet Argos. Argos was jolted from its orbit by Krypton&#x27;s explosion into a much further orbit and only Kara survived freezing to death. When Superman finds her, he brings her back to Earth and treats her as a cousin. As continued in &quot;[[Justice League Unlimited]],&quot; she and Superman grow very close, almost like siblings, but she departs when she falls in love with [[Brainiac 5]] of the Legion of Super-Heroes in the distant future, feeling that she had never really fit in on Earth in the present.
* &quot;[[Superman/Batman: Apocalypse]]&quot;, a direct-to-video animated film released in September 2010, largely parallels the origin-story arc launched in the &quot;[[Superman/Batman]]&quot; comic series in 2004, with some minor plot differences. Kara Zor-El, voiced by [[Summer Glau]], is described unambiguously as Kal-El&#x27;s cousin from Krypton.
* &quot;[[DC Super Hero Girls]]&quot; or &quot;DC Superhero Girls&quot; (in various countries) is an American super hero [[action figure]] franchise created by [[DC Comics]] (a subsidiary of [[Time Warner]]) and [[Mattel]] that launched in the third quarter of 2015.

Supergirl was voiced by Anais Fairweather. A movie &quot;[[DC Super Hero Girls: Hero of the Year]]&quot; based on the series, was released in 2016. She also appeared in the [[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|2019 TV series of the same name]], voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]].

* Supergirl appears in the fourth season episode of &quot;[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]&quot; &quot;Getting Ice Dick, Don&#x27;t Wait Up&quot;, voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]].
* Supergirl is introduced as a central character in the second season of &quot;[[My Adventures with Superman]]&quot;. In this series, her backstory and character are changed completely. When introduced, she is depicted in a more villainous way as a conqueror for the new Kryptonian Empire, having been captured by the series version of [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] as an infant before her father, [[Zor-El]], could send her to Earth alongside [[Superman|Kal-El]]. However she is later revealed to have been brainwashed and conditioned by Braniac into believing she was helping the galaxy by bringing many worlds into the fold of the utopian Kryptonian Empire, when in actuality Brainiac was setting her loose to destroy every world they visited, [[Thanagar]] among them, and wiping her memories of the events. It&#x27;s with this heavy dose of reality, combined with resurfaced memories from her subconcious, that she breaks free from Braniac&#x27;s control, sees the error of her ways, and paves the path for her redemption.

===Video games===
* Supergirl appears as a playable character in &quot;[[Justice League Heroes]]&quot; exclusive for [[PlayStation Portable]].
* A [[Lego minifigure]] version of Supergirl appears as a playable character in &quot;[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]&quot;, &quot;[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]&quot;, and will appear in the DC TV Super-Heroes DLC pack in &quot;[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]&quot;.
* Supergirl makes a cameo appearance in the IOS version of &quot;&quot; as a support card.
* Supergirl appears as a playable character in &quot;[[Injustice 2]]&quot;, voiced by [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]]. In the story, her escape pod is retrieved by Black Adam after the events of the first game. She is trained by Black Adam and Wonder Woman into perfecting her powers as they tell her stories of her cousin, inspiring her to become Supergirl. After the Regime and Insurgency ally with each other to take out Brainiac (who was responsible for Krypton&#x27;s destruction), Kara discovers what the Regime has truly done on the planet and is appalled by her cousin&#x27;s actions. She and Batman infiltrate Brainiac&#x27;s ship to stop the tyrant, and when Batman and Superman argue with each other over the Brainiac&#x27;s fate, she allies herself with Batman, believing that her cousin is behaving more like General Zod than Jor-El. She appears in both of the game&#x27;s endings, where she will either become a part of Batman&#x27;s Justice League to recapture what her cousin stood for before Lois&#x27; death, or will be imprisoned by Superman until she becomes a part of his Regime. In her single player ending, she works with the Justice League to revive the Kryptonian civilizations of Argo City and Kandor.
* Supergirl appeared in &quot;[[Lego Dimensions]]&quot; as a playable character, voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]]. She and [[Green Arrow]] were only available during the Lego convention BrickLive. However, she eventually appeared in the [[PS4]] version of the Starter Pack. She shares most of her abilities with [[Superman]], but, unlike in previous Lego games, she can turn into a Red Lantern, which is a reference to the comic “Red Daughter of Krypton”.

<text>The Great Western Railway (GWR) was a British railway company that linked London with the southwest, west and West Midlands of England and most of Wales. It was founded in 1833, received its enabling act of Parliament on 31 August 1835 and ran its first trains in 1838 with the initial route completed between London and Bristol in 1841. It was engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who chose a broad gauge of —later slightly widened to —but, from 1854, a series of amalgamations saw it also operate standard-gauge trains; the last broad-gauge services were operated in 1892.

The GWR was the only company to keep its identity through the Railways Act 1921, which amalgamated it with the remaining independent railways within its territory, and it was finally merged at the end of 1947 when it was nationalised and became the Western Region of British Railways.

The GWR was called by some &quot;God&#x27;s Wonderful Railway&quot; and by others the &quot;Great Way Round&quot; but it was famed as the &quot;Holiday Line&quot;, taking many people to English and Bristol Channel resorts in the West Country as well as the far southwest of England such as Torquay in Devon, Minehead in Somerset, and Newquay and St Ives in Cornwall. The company&#x27;s locomotives, many of which were built in the company&#x27;s workshops at Swindon, were painted a middle chrome green colour while, for most of its existence, it used a two-tone &quot;chocolate and cream&quot; livery for its passenger coaches. Goods wagons were painted red but this was later changed to mid-grey.

Great Western trains included long-distance express services such as the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;, the &quot;Cornish Riviera Express&quot; and the &quot;Cheltenham Spa Express&quot;. It also operated many suburban and rural services, some operated by steam rail motors or autotrains. The company pioneered the use of larger, more economic goods wagons than were usual in Britain. It ran ferry services to Ireland and the Channel Islands, operated a network of road motor (bus) routes, was a part of the Railway Air Services, and owned ships, canals, docks and hotels.

==History==

===Formation===

The Great Western Railway originated from the desire of Bristol merchants to maintain their city as the second port of the country and the chief one for American trade. The increase in the size of ships and the gradual silting of the River Avon had made Liverpool an increasingly attractive port, and with a Liverpool to London rail line under construction in the 1830s Bristol&#x27;s status was threatened. The answer for Bristol was, with the co-operation of London interests, to build a line of their own; a railway built to unprecedented standards of excellence to out-perform the lines being constructed to the North West of England.

The company was founded at a meeting in Bristol on 21 January 1833. Isambard Kingdom Brunel, then aged 27, was appointed engineer on 7 March 1833. The name Great Western Railway was adopted on 19 August 1833, and the company and was incorporated by the Great Western Railway Act 1835 (5 &amp; 6 Will. 4. c. cvii) on 31 August 1835.

===Route of the line===
This was by far Brunel&#x27;s largest contract to date. He made two controversial decisions. Firstly, he chose to use a broad gauge of to allow for the possibility of large wheels outside the bodies of the rolling stock which could give smoother running at high speeds. Secondly, he selected a route, north of the Marlborough Downs, which had no significant towns but which offered potential connections to Oxford and Gloucester. This meant the line was not direct from London to Bristol. From Reading heading west, the line would curve in a northerly sweep back to Bath.

Brunel surveyed the entire length of the route between London and Bristol himself, with the help of many, including his solicitor, Jeremiah Osborne of the Bristol law firm Osborne Clarke, who on one occasion rowed Brunel down the River Avon to survey the bank of the river for the route.

George Thomas Clark played an important role as an engineer on the project, reputedly taking the management of two divisions of the route including bridges over the River Thames at Lower Basildon and Moulsford and of Paddington Station. Involvement in major earth-moving works seems to have fed Clark&#x27;s interest in geology and archaeology and he, anonymously, authored two guidebooks on the railway: one illustrated with lithographs by John Cooke Bourne; the other, a critique of Brunel&#x27;s methods and the broad gauge.
The first of line, from Paddington station in London to Maidenhead Bridge station, opened on 4 June 1838. When Maidenhead Railway Bridge was ready the line was extended to on 1 July 1839 and then through the deep Sonning Cutting to on 30 March 1840. The cutting was the scene of a railway disaster two years later when a goods train ran into a landslip; ten passengers who were travelling in open trucks were killed.

This accident prompted Parliament to pass the Railway Regulation Act 1844, requiring railway companies to provide better carriages for passengers. The next section, from Reading to crossed the Thames twice and opened for traffic on 1 June 1840. A extension took the line to Faringdon Road on 20 July 1840. Meanwhile, work had started at the Bristol end of the line, where the section to Bath opened on 31 August 1840.
On 17 December 1840, the line from London reached a temporary terminus at west of Swindon and from Paddington. The section from Wootton Bassett Road to was opened on 31 May 1841, as was Swindon Junction station where the Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway (C&amp;GWUR) to Cirencester connected. That was an independent line worked by the GWR, as was the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B&amp;ER), the first section of which from Bristol to was opened on 14 June 1841. The GWR main line remained incomplete during the construction of the Box Tunnel, which was ready for trains on 30 June 1841, after which trains ran the from Paddington through to Bridgwater. In 1851, the GWR purchased the Kennet and Avon Canal, which was a competing carrier between London, Reading, Bath and Bristol.

The GWR was closely involved with the C&amp;GWUR and the B&amp;ER and with several other broad-gauge railways. The South Devon Railway was completed in 1849, extending the broad gauge to Plymouth, whence the Cornwall Railway took it over the Royal Albert Bridge and into Cornwall in 1859 and, in 1867, it reached over the West Cornwall Railway which originally had been laid in 1852 with the standard gauge or &quot;narrow gauge&quot; as it was known at the time. The South Wales Railway had opened between and in 1850 and became connected to the GWR by Brunel&#x27;s Chepstow Bridge in 1852. It was completed to in 1856, where a transatlantic port was established.

There was initially no direct line from London to Wales as the tidal River Severn was too wide to cross. Trains instead had to follow a lengthy route via Gloucester, where the river was narrow enough to be crossed by a bridge. Work on the Severn Tunnel had begun in 1873, but unexpected underwater springs delayed the work and prevented its opening until 1886.

=== Brunel&#x27;s 7-foot gauge and the &quot;gauge war&quot; ===


Brunel had devised a track gauge for his railways in 1835. He later added , probably to reduce friction of the wheel sets in curves. This became the broad gauge. Either gauge may be referred to as &quot;Brunel&#x27;s&quot; gauge.

In 1844, the broad-gauge Bristol and Gloucester Railway had opened, but Gloucester was already served by the lines of the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway. This resulted in a break-of-gauge that forced all passengers and goods to change trains if travelling between the south-west and the North. This was the beginning of the &quot;gauge war&quot; and led to the appointment by Parliament of a Gauge Commission, which reported in 1846 in favour of standard gauge so the 7-foot gauge was proscribed by law (Railway Regulation (Gauge) Act 1846) except for the southwest of England and Wales where connected to the GWR network.

Other railways in Britain were to use standard gauge. In 1846, the Bristol and Gloucester was bought by the Midland Railway and it was converted to standard gauge in 1854, which brought mixed-gauge track to Temple Meads station – this had three rails to allow trains to run on either broad or standard gauge.

The GWR extended into the West Midlands in competition with the Midland and the London and North Western Railway. Birmingham was reached through in 1852 and Wolverhampton in 1854. This was the furthest north that the broad gauge reached. In the same year the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway and the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway both amalgamated with the GWR, but these lines were standard gauge, and the GWR&#x27;s own line north of Oxford had been built with mixed gauge.

This mixed gauge was extended southwards from Oxford to at the end of 1856 and so allowed through goods traffic from the north of England to the south coast (via the London and South Western Railway – LSWR) without transshipment.

The line to Basingstoke had originally been built by the Berks and Hants Railway as a broad-gauge route in an attempt to keep the standard gauge of the LSWR out of Great Western territory but, in 1857, the GWR and LSWR opened a shared line to on the south coast, the GWR route being via Chippenham and a route initially started by the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway. Further west, the LSWR took over the broad-gauge Exeter and Crediton Railway and North Devon Railway, also the standard-gauge Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway.

It was several years before these remote lines were connected with the parent LSWR system and any through traffic to them was handled by the GWR and its associated companies.

By now the gauge war was lost and mixed gauge was brought to Paddington in 1861, allowing through passenger trains from London to Chester. The broad-gauge South Wales Railway amalgamated with the GWR in 1862, as did the West Midland Railway, which brought with it the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway, a line that had been conceived as another broad-gauge route to the Midlands but which had been built as standard gauge after several battles, both political and physical.

On 1 April 1869, the broad gauge was taken out of use between Oxford and Wolverhampton and from Reading to Basingstoke. In August, the line from to was converted from broad to standard and the whole of the line from Swindon through Gloucester to South Wales was similarly treated in May 1872. In 1874, the mixed gauge was extended along the main line to Chippenham and the line from there to Weymouth was narrowed. The following year saw mixed gauge laid through the Box Tunnel, with the broad gauge now retained only for through services beyond Bristol and on a few branch lines.

The Bristol and Exeter Railway amalgamated with the GWR on 1 January 1876. It had already made a start on mixing the gauge on its line, a task completed through to Exeter on 1 March 1876 by the GWR. The station here had been shared with the LSWR since 1862. This rival company had continued to push westwards over its Exeter and Crediton line and arrived in Plymouth later in 1876, which spurred the South Devon Railway to also amalgamate with the Great Western. The Cornwall Railway remained a nominally independent line until 1889, although the GWR held a large number of shares in the company.

One final new broad-gauge route was opened on 1 June 1877, the St Ives branch in west Cornwall, although there was also a small extension at Sutton Harbour in Plymouth in 1879. Part of a mixed gauge point remains at Sutton Harbour, one of the few examples of broad gauge trackwork remaining in situ anywhere.

Once the GWR was in control of the whole line from London to Penzance, it set about converting the remaining broad-gauge tracks. The last broad-gauge service left Paddington station on Friday, 20 May 1892; the following Monday, trains from Penzance were operated by standard-gauge locomotives.

===Into the 20th century===

After 1892, with the burden of operating trains on two gauges removed, the company turned its attention to constructing new lines and upgrading old ones to shorten the company&#x27;s previously circuitous routes. The principal new lines opened were:
* 1900: Stert and Westbury linking the Berks and Hants line with to create a shorter route to for the Channel Islands traffic.
* 1903: the South Wales and Bristol Direct Railway from Wootton Bassett Junction to link up with the Severn Tunnel.
* 1904: a diversion of the Cornish Main Line between and , eliminating the last wooden viaducts on the main line.
* 1906: the Langport and Castle Cary Railway to shorten the journey from London to between and .
* 1908: the Birmingham and North Warwickshire which, combined with the Cheltenham and Honeybourne of 1906, offered a new route from Birmingham via to south Wales.
* 1910: the Birmingham Direct Line built jointly with the Great Central Railway to give a shorter route from London to and the North.
* 1913: the Swansea District Lines which allowed trains to to avoid . Fishguard had been opened in an attempt to attract transatlantic liner traffic and provided a better facility for the Anglo-Irish ferries than that at Neyland.

The generally conservative GWR made other improvements in the years before World War I such as restaurant cars, better conditions for third class passengers, steam heating of trains, and faster express services. These were largely at the initiative of T. I. Allen, the Superintendent of the Line and one of a group of talented senior managers who led the railway into the Edwardian era: Viscount Emlyn (Earl Cawdor, Chairman from 1895 to 1905); Sir Joseph Wilkinson (general manager from 1896 to 1903), his successor, the former chief engineer Sir James Inglis; and George Jackson Churchward (the Chief Mechanical Engineer). It was during this period that the GWR introduced road motor services as an alternative to building new lines in rural areas, and started using steam rail motors to bring cheaper operation to existing branch lines.

===One of the &quot;Big Four&quot;===
At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the GWR was taken into government control, as were most major railways in Britain. Many of its staff joined the armed forces and it was more difficult to build and maintain equipment than in peacetime. After the war, the government considered permanent nationalisation but decided instead on a compulsory amalgamation of the railways into four large groups. The GWR alone preserved its name through the &quot;grouping&quot;, under which smaller companies were amalgamated into four main companies in 1922 and 1923. The GWR built a war memorial at Paddington station, unveiled in 1922, in memory of its employees who were killed in the war.

The new Great Western Railway had more routes in Wales, including of former Cambrian Railways lines and from the Taff Vale Railway. A few independent lines in its English area of operations were also added, notably the Midland and South Western Junction Railway, a line previously working closely with the Midland Railway but which now gave the GWR a second station at Swindon, along with a line that carried through-traffic from the North via Cheltenham and to Southampton.

The 1930s brought hard times but the company remained in fair financial health despite the Depression. The Development (Loans, Guarantees and Grants) Act 1929 allowed the GWR to obtain money in return for stimulating employment and this was used to improve stations including London Paddington, and Cardiff General; to improve facilities at depots and to lay additional tracks to reduce congestion. The road motor services were transferred to local bus companies in which the GWR took a share but instead, it participated in air services.

A legacy of the broad gauge was that trains for some routes could be built slightly wider than was normal in Britain and these included the 1929-built &quot;Super Saloons&quot; used on the boat train services that conveyed transatlantic passengers to London in luxury. When the company celebrated its centenary during 1935, new &quot;Centenary&quot; carriages were built for the Cornish Riviera Express, which again made full use of the wider loading gauge on that route.

===World War II and after===
With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the GWR returned to direct government control, and by the end of the war a Labour government was in power and again planning to nationalise the railways. After a couple of years trying to recover from the ravages of war, the GWR became the Western Region of British Railways on 1 January 1948. The Great Western Railway Company continued to exist as a legal entity for nearly two more years, being formally wound up on 23 December 1949. GWR designs of locomotives and rolling stock continued to be built for a while and the region maintained its own distinctive character, even painting for a while its stations and express trains in a form of chocolate and cream.

About 40 years after nationalisation British Rail was privatised and the old name was revived by Great Western Trains, the train operating company providing passenger services on the old GWR routes to South Wales and the South West. This subsequently became First Great Western, as part of the FirstGroup, but in September 2015 changed its name to Great Western Railway in order to &#x27;reinstate the ideals of our founder&#x27;. The operating infrastructure, however, was transferred to Railtrack and has since passed to Network Rail. These companies have continued to preserve appropriate parts of its stations and bridges so historic GWR structures can still be recognised around the network.

==Geography==

The original Great Western Main Line linked London Paddington station with Temple Meads station in Bristol by way of , Didcot, , and Bath. This line was extended westwards through Exeter and Plymouth to reach and , the most westerly railway station in England. Brunel and Gooch placed the GWR&#x27;s main locomotive workshops close to the village of Swindon and the locomotives of many trains were changed here in the early years. Up to this point the route had climbed very gradually westwards from London, but from here it changed into one with steeper gradients which, with the primitive locomotives available to Brunel, was better operated by types with smaller wheels better able to climb the hills. These gradients faced both directions, first dropping down through Wootton Bassett Junction to cross the River Avon, then climbing back up through Chippenham to the Box Tunnel before descending once more to regain the River Avon&#x27;s valley which it followed to Bath and Bristol.

Swindon was also the junction for a line that ran north-westwards to then south-westwards on the far side of the River Severn to reach Cardiff, and west Wales. This route was later shortened by the opening of a more direct east–west route through the Severn Tunnel. Another route ran northwards from Didcot to from where two different routes continued to Wolverhampton, one through Birmingham and the other through Worcester. Beyond Wolverhampton the line continued via to and (via a joint line with the LNWR) onwards to Birkenhead and Warrington; another route via enabled the GWR to reach . Operating agreements with other companies also allowed GWR trains to run to Manchester. South of the London to Bristol main line were routes from Didcot to Southampton via , and from Chippenham to via .

A network of cross-country routes linked these main lines, and there were also many and varied branch lines. Some were short, such as the Clevedon branch line; others were much longer such as the Minehead Branch. A few were promoted and built by the GWR to counter competition from other companies, such as the Reading to Basingstoke Line to keep the London and South Western Railway away from . However, many were built by local companies that then sold their railway to their larger neighbour; examples include the Launceston and branches. Further variety came from the traffic carried: holidaymakers (St Ives);. royalty (Windsor); or just goods traffic (Carbis Wharf).

Brunel envisaged the GWR continuing across the Atlantic Ocean and built the to carry the railway&#x27;s passengers from Bristol to New York. Most traffic for North America soon switched to the larger port of Liverpool (in other railways&#x27; territories) but some transatlantic passengers were landed at Plymouth and conveyed to London by special train. Great Western ships linked Great Britain with Ireland, the Channel Islands and France.

===Key locations===
The railway&#x27;s headquarters were established at Paddington station. Its locomotives and rolling stock were built and maintained at Swindon Works but other workshops were acquired as it amalgamated with other railways, including the Shrewsbury companies&#x27; Stafford Road works at Wolverhampton, and the South Devon&#x27;s workshops at Newton Abbot. Worcester Carriage Works was created by flattening land north of Worcester Shrub Hill Station, Reading Signal Works was established in buildings to the north of Reading railway station, and in later years a concrete manufacturing depot was established at where items ranging from track components to bridges were cast.

===Engineering features===

More than 150 years after its creation, the original main line has been described by historian Steven Brindle as &quot;one of the masterpieces of railway design&quot;. Working westwards from Paddington, the line crosses the valley of the River Brent on Wharncliffe Viaduct and the River Thames on Maidenhead Railway Bridge, which at the time of construction was the largest span achieved by a brick arch bridge. The line then continues through Sonning Cutting before reaching Reading after which it crosses the Thames twice more, on Gatehampton and Moulsford bridges. Between Chippenham and Bath is Box Tunnel, the longest railway tunnel driven by that time. Several years later, the railway opened the even longer Severn Tunnel to carry a new line between England and Wales beneath the River Severn.

Some other notable structures were added when smaller companies were amalgamated into the GWR. These include the South Devon Railway sea wall, the Cornwall Railway&#x27;s Royal Albert Bridge, and Barmouth Bridge on the Cambrian Railways.

==Operations==
In the early years the GWR was managed by two committees, one in Bristol and one in London. They soon combined as a single board of directors which met in offices at Paddington.

The board was led by a chairman and supported by a secretary and other &quot;officers&quot;. The first Locomotive Superintendent was Daniel Gooch, although from 1915 the title was changed to Chief Mechanical Engineer. The first Goods Manager was appointed in 1850 and from 1857 this position was filled by James Grierson until 1863 when he became the first general manager. In 1864 the post of Superintendent of the Line was created to oversee the running of the trains.

===Passenger services===

Early trains offered passengers a choice of first- or second-class carriages. In 1840 this choice was extended: passengers could be conveyed by the slow goods trains in what became third-class. The Railway Regulation Act 1844 made it a legal requirement that the GWR, along with all other British railways, had to serve each station with trains which included third-class accommodation at a fare of not more than one penny per mile and a speed of at least . By 1882, third-class carriages were attached to all trains except for the fastest expresses. Another parliamentary order meant that trains began to include smoking carriages from 1868.

Special &quot;excursion&quot; cheap-day tickets were first issued in May 1849 and season tickets in 1851. Until 1869 most revenue came from second-class passengers but the volume of third-class passengers grew to the extent that second-class facilities were withdrawn in 1912. The Cheap Trains Act 1883 resulted in the provision of workmen&#x27;s trains at special low fares at certain times of the day.

The principal express services were often given nicknames by railwaymen but these names later appeared officially in timetables, on headboards carried on the locomotive, and on roofboards above the windows of the carriages. For instance, the late-morning &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; express between London and Exeter was named after the winning horse of the Derby and St Leger races in 1849. Although withdrawn at the end of 1867, the name was revived in 1869 – following a request from the Bristol and Exeter Railway – and the train ran through to Plymouth. An afternoon express was instigated on the same route in June 1879 and became known as &quot;The Zulu&quot;. A third West Country express was introduced in 1890, running to and from Penzance as &quot;The Cornishman&quot;. A new service, the &quot;Cornish Riviera Express&quot; ran between London and Penzance – non-stop to Plymouth – from 1 July 1904, although it ran only in the summer during 1904 and 1905 before becoming a permanent feature of the timetable in 1906.

The &quot;Cheltenham Spa Express&quot; was the fastest train in the world when it was scheduled to cover the between and London at an average of . The train was nicknamed the &#x27;Cheltenham Flyer&#x27; and featured in one of the GWR&#x27;s &#x27;Books for boys of all ages&#x27;. Other named trains included &quot;The Bristolian&quot;, running between London and Bristol from 1935, and the &quot;Torbay Express&quot;, which ran between London and .

Many of these fast expresses included special coaches that could be detached as they passed through stations without stopping, a guard riding in the coach to uncouple it from the main train and bring it to a stop at the correct position. The first such &quot;slip coach&quot; was detached from the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; at in 1869. The company&#x27;s first sleeping cars were operated between Paddington and Plymouth in 1877. Then on 1 October 1892 its first corridor train ran from Paddington to Birkenhead, and the following year saw the first trains heated by steam that was passed through the train in a pipe from the locomotive. May 1896 saw the introduction of first-class restaurant cars and the service was extended to all classes in 1903. Sleeping cars for third-class passengers were available from 1928.

Self-propelled &quot;steam railmotors&quot; were first used on 12 October 1903 between and ; within five years 100 had been constructed. These trains had special retractable steps that could be used at stations with lower platforms than was usual in England. The railmotors proved so successful on many routes that they had to be supplemented by trailer cars with driving controls, the first of which entered service at the end of 1904. From the following year a number of small locomotives were fitted so that they could work with these trailers, the combined sets becoming known as &quot;autotrains&quot; and eventually replacing the steam rail motors. Diesel railcars were introduced in 1934. Some railcars were fully streamlined, some had buffet counters for long-distance services, and others were purely for parcels services.

===Freight services===

Passenger traffic was the main source of revenue for the GWR when it first opened but goods were also carried in separate trains. It was not until the coal-mining and industrial districts of Wales and the Midlands were reached that goods traffic became significant; in 1856 the Ruabon Coal Company signed an agreement with the GWR to transport coal to London at special rates which nonetheless was worth at least £40,000 each year to the railway.

As locomotives increased in size so did the length of goods trains, from 40 to as many as 100 four-wheeled wagons, although the gradient of the line often limited this. While typical goods wagons could carry 8, 10 or (later) 12 tons, the load placed into a wagon could be as little as 1 ton. The many smaller consignments were sent to a local transhipment centre where they were re-sorted into larger loads for the main segment of their journey. There were more than 550 &quot;station truck&quot; workings running on timetabled goods trains carrying small consignments to and from specified stations, and 200 &quot;pick up&quot; trucks that collected small loads from groups of stations.

The GWR provided special wagons, handling equipment and storage facilities for its largest traffic flows. For example, the coal mines in Wales sent much of their coal to the docks along the coast, many of which were owned and equipped by the railway, as were some in Cornwall that exported most of the china clay production of that county. The wagons provided for both these traffic flows (both those owned by the GWR and the mining companies) were fitted with end doors that allowed their loads to be tipped straight into the ships&#x27; holds using wagon-tipping equipment on the dockside. Special wagons were produced for many other different commodities such as gunpowder, aeroplane propellers, motor cars, fruit and fish.

Heavy traffic was carried from the agricultural and fishing areas in the southwest of England, often in fast &quot;perishables&quot; trains, for instance more than 3,500 cattle were sent from in the 12 months to June 1869, and in 1876 nearly than 17,000 tons of fish was carried from west Cornwall to London. The perishables trains running in the nineteenth century used wagons built to the same standards as passenger coaches, with vacuum brakes and large wheels to allow fast running. Ordinary goods trains on the GWR, as on all other British railways at the time, had wheels close together (around apart), smaller wheels and only hand brakes.

In 1905 the GWR ran its first vacuum-braked general goods train between London and Bristol using newly built goods wagons with small wheels but vacuum brakes. This was followed by other services to create a network of fast trains between the major centres of production and population that were scheduled to run at speeds averaging . Other railway companies also followed the GWR&#x27;s lead by providing their own vacuum-braked (or &quot;fitted&quot;) services.

===Ancillary operations===

A number of canals, such as the Kennet and Avon Canal and the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal, became the property of the railway when they were purchased to remove competition or objectors to proposed new lines. Most of these continued to be operated although they were only a small part of the railway company&#x27;s business: in 1929 the canals took £16,278 of receipts while freight trains earned over £17 million. (£ and £ respectively in ).

The Railways Act 1921 brought most of the large coal-exporting docks in South Wales into the GWR&#x27;s ownership, such as those at Cardiff, Barry, and Swansea. They were added to a small number of docks along the south coast of England which the company already owned, to make it the largest docks operator in the world.

Powers were granted by Parliament for the GWR to operate ships in 1871. The following year the company took over the ships operated by Ford and Jackson on the route between Neyland in Wales and Waterford in Ireland. The Welsh terminal was relocated to when the railway was opened to there in 1906. Services were also operated between and the Channel Islands from 1889 on the former Weymouth and Channel Islands Steam Packet Company routes. Smaller GWR vessels were also used as tenders at Plymouth Great Western Docks and, until the Severn Tunnel opened, on the River Severn crossing of the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway.

The first railway-operated bus services were started by the GWR between Helston railway station and The Lizard on 17 August 1903. Known by the company as &quot;road motors&quot;, these chocolate-and-cream buses operated throughout the company&#x27;s territory on railway feeder services and excursions until the 1930s when they were transferred to local bus companies (in most of which the GWR held a share).

The GWR inaugurated the first railway air service between Cardiff, Torquay and Plymouth in association with Imperial Airways. This grew to become part of the Railway Air Services.

==Motive power and rolling stock==

===Locomotives===


The GWR&#x27;s first locomotives were specified by Isambard Kingdom Brunel but proved unsatisfactory. Daniel Gooch, who was just 20 years old, was soon appointed as the railway&#x27;s Locomotive Superintendent and set about establishing a reliable fleet. He bought two locomotives from Robert Stephenson and Company which proved more successful than Brunel&#x27;s, and then designed a series of standardised locomotives. From 1846 these could be built at the company&#x27;s newly established railway workshops at Swindon. He designed several different broad-gauge types for the growing railway, such as the Firefly 2-2-2s and later Iron Duke Class 4-2-2s. In 1864 Gooch was succeeded by Joseph Armstrong who brought his standard-gauge experience to the railway. Some of Armstrong&#x27;s designs were built as either broad or standard gauge just by fitting different wheels; those needing tenders were given old ones from withdrawn broad-gauge locomotives.

Joseph Armstrong&#x27;s early death in 1877 meant that the next phase of motive power design was the responsibility of William Dean who developed express 4-4-0 types rather than the single-driver 2-2-2s and 4-2-2s that had hauled fast trains up to that time. Dean retired in 1902 to be replaced by George Jackson Churchward, who introduced the familiar 4-6-0 locomotives. It was during Churchward&#x27;s tenure that the term &quot;Locomotive Superintendent&quot; was changed to &quot;Chief Mechanical Engineer&quot; (CME). Charles Collett succeeded Churchward in 1921. He was soon responsible for the much larger fleet that the GWR operated following the Railways Act 1921 mergers. He set about replacing the older and less numerous classes, and rebuilding the remainder using as many standardised GWR components as possible. He also produced many new designs using standard parts, such as the Castle and King classes. The final CME was Frederick Hawksworth who took control in 1941, seeing the railway through wartime shortages and producing GWR-design locomotives until after nationalisation.

Brunel and Gooch both gave their locomotives names to identify them, but the standard-gauge companies that became a part of the GWR used numbers. Until 1864 the GWR therefore had named broad-gauge locomotives and numbered standard-gauge ones. From the time of Armstrong&#x27;s arrival all new locomotives – both broad and standard – were given numbers, including broad-gauge ones that had previously carried names when they were acquired from other railways. Dean introduced a policy in 1895 of giving passenger tender locomotives both numbers and names. Each batch was given names with a distinctive theme, for example kings for the 6000 class and castles for the 4073 class.

The GWR first painted its locomotives a dark holly green but this was changed to middle chrome or Brunswick green for most of its existence. They initially had chocolate brown or Indian red frames but this was changed in the twentieth century to black. Name and number plates were generally of polished brass with a black background, and chimneys often had copper rims or &quot;caps&quot;.

Liveries through the years:
===Carriages===
GWR passenger coaches were many and varied, ranging from four- and six-wheeled vehicles on the original broad-gauge line of 1838, through to bogie coaches up to long which were in service through to 1947 and beyond. Vacuum brakes, bogies and through-corridors all came into use during the nineteenth century, and in 1900 the first electrically lit coaches were put into service. The 1920s saw some vehicles fitted with automatic couplings and steel bodies.

Early vehicles were built by a number of independent companies, but in 1844 the railway started to build carriages at Swindon railway works, which eventually provided most of the railway&#x27;s rolling stock. Special vehicles included sleeping cars, restaurant cars and slip coaches. Passengers were also carried in railmotors, autotrains, and diesel railcars. Passenger-rated vans carried parcels, horses, and milk at express speeds. Representative examples of these carriages survive in service today on various Heritage railways up and down the country.

Most coaches were generally painted in variations of a chocolate-brown and cream livery, however they were plain brown or red until 1864 and from 1908 to 1922. Parcels vans and similar vehicles were seldom painted in the two-colour livery, being plain brown or red instead, which caused them to be known as &quot;brown vehicles&quot;.

===Wagons===
In the early years of the GWR its wagons were painted brown, but this changed to red before the end of the broad gauge. The familiar dark grey livery was introduced about 1904.

Most early wagons were four-wheeled open vehicles, although a few six-wheeled vehicles were provided for special loads. Covered vans followed, initially for carrying cattle but later for both general and vulnerable goods too. The first bogie wagons appeared in 1873 for heavy loads, but bogie coal wagons were built in 1904 following on from the large four-wheel coal wagons that had first appeared in 1898. Rated at 20 tons (20.3 tonnes) these were twice the size of typical wagons of the period, but it was not until 1923 that the company invested heavily in coal wagons of this size and the infrastructure necessary for their unloading at their docks; these were known as &quot;Felix Pole&quot; wagons after the GWR&#x27;s general manager who promoted their use. Container wagons appeared in 1931 and special vans for motor cars in 1933.

When the GWR was opened no trains in the United Kingdom were fitted with vacuum brakes, instead handbrakes were fitted to individual wagons and trains also conveyed brake vans where a guard had control of a screw-operated brake. The first goods wagons to be fitted with vacuum brakes were those that ran in passenger trains carrying perishable goods such as fish. Some ballast hoppers were given vacuum brakes in December 1903, and general goods wagons were constructed with them from 1904 onwards, although unfitted wagons (those without vacuum brakes) still formed the majority of the fleet in 1948 when the railway was nationalised to become a part of British Railways.

All wagons for public traffic had a code name that was used in telegraphic messages. As this was usually painted onto the wagon it was common to see them referred to by these names, such as &quot;Mink&quot; (a van), &quot;Mica&quot; (refrigerated van), &quot;Crocodile&quot; (boiler truck), and &quot;Toad&quot; (brake van).

==Track==
For the permanent way Brunel decided to use a light bridge rail continuously supported on thick timber baulks, known as &quot;baulk road&quot;. Thinner timber transoms were used to keep the baulks the correct distance apart. This produced a smoother track and the whole assembly proved cheaper than using conventional sleepers for broad-gauge track, although this advantage was lost with standard- or mixed-gauge lines because of the higher ratio of timber to length of line. More conventional track forms were later used, although baulk road could still be seen in sidings in the first half of the twentieth century.
==Signalling==

Brunel developed a system of &quot;disc and crossbar&quot; signals to control train movements, but the people operating them could only assume that each train reached the next signal without stopping unexpectedly. The world&#x27;s first commercial telegraph line was installed along the from Paddington to West Drayton and came into operation on 9 April 1839. This later spread throughout the system and allowed stations to use telegraphic messages to tell the people operating the signals when each train arrived safely. A long list of code words were developed to help make messages both quick to send and clear in meaning.

More conventional semaphore signals replaced the discs and crossbars over time. The GWR persisted with the lower quadrant form, where a &quot;proceed&quot; aspect is indicated by lowering the signal arm, despite other British railways changing to an upper quadrant form. Electric light signals of the &quot;searchlight&quot; pattern were later introduced at busy stations; these could show the same red/green or yellow/green aspects that semaphore signals showed at night. An &quot;automatic train control&quot; system was introduced from 1906 which was a safety system that applied a train&#x27;s brakes if it passed a danger signal.
==Cultural impact==
The GWR is known admiringly to some as &quot;God&#x27;s Wonderful Railway&quot;, but jocularly to others as the &quot;Great Way Round&quot; as some of its earliest routes were not the most direct. The railway, however, promoted itself from 1908 as &quot;The Holiday Line&quot; as it carried huge numbers of people to resorts in Wales and south-west England.

===Tourism===

Cheap tickets were offered and excursion trains operated to popular destinations and special events such as the 1851 Great Exhibition. Later, GWR road motors operated tours to popular destinations not served directly by train, and its ships offered cruises from places such as Plymouth. Redundant carriages were converted to camp coaches and placed at country or seaside stations such as and and hired to holidaymakers who arrived by train.

The GWR had operated hotels at major stations and junctions since the early days, but in 1877 it opened its first &quot;country house hotel&quot;, the Tregenna Castle in St Ives, Cornwall. It later added the Fishguard Bay Hotel in Wales and the Manor House at Moretonhampstead, Devon, to which it added a golf course in 1930.

It promoted itself from 1908 as &quot;The Holiday Line through a series of posters, postcards, jigsaw puzzles, and books. These included &quot;Holiday Haunts&quot;, describing the attraction of the different parts of the GWR system, and regional titles such as S. P. B. Mais&#x27;s &quot;Cornish Riviera&quot; and A. M. Bradley&#x27;s &quot;South Wales: The Country of Castles&quot;. Guidebooks described the scenery seen &quot;Through the Window&quot; of their trains. Other GWR books were designed to encourage an interest in the GWR itself. Published as &quot;Books for Boys of All Ages&quot;, these included &quot;The 10:30 Limited&quot; and &quot;Loco&#x27;s of the Royal Road&quot;.

The Great Western Railway effectively created the modern day tourist spots of the West Country and the southwest part of Wales that had previously been very difficult to reach. The Bristol Channel resorts of Wales and the West Country such as Minehead or the cliffs of Exmoor had been very remote from other parts of England before the advent of the GWR.
===Locomotive books===
Railway enthusiasts were kept informed of new locomotives and other topics through the &quot;Great Western Railway Magazine&quot; from 1904. In 1911 the GWR became the first company to publish a book about its locomotive stock. &quot;Names of Engines&quot; was a booklet containing an alphabetic list of the company&#x27;s named engines, with their number and wheel arrangement. Alternate pages showed formal vignetted photographs of different types of engine, mostly in photographic grey, annotated with their principal dimensions. No author was credited but the list was compiled by Arthur J.L White in the railway&#x27;s Chief Mechanical Engineer&#x27;s Office.

New editions were printed in 1914 and 1917 as &quot;Great Western Railway Engines&quot; edited by and then as &quot;Great Western Railway Engines: Names, Numbers, Types and Classes&quot; in 1919 with new editions at regular intervals up to 1929. These listed the named engines by class, each class having a formal photograph annotated with extensive dimensions and engineering details. Some classes of unnamed engines were also given a page with a photograph and similar annotations. No author was credited, but the introductory essay &quot;Naming of Locomotives&quot; was signed Arthur White died in 1929 and from 1932 new editions, now &quot;The G.W.R. Engine Book&quot; were published by the GWR&#x27;s Publicity Department up to 1935.

From 1938 the editor was given as who was W.G. Chapman. The title was now &quot;GWR Engines: Names, Numbers Types, Classes, etc. of Great Western Railway Locomotives&quot;. There were reprints (also listed as editions) following in 1938 (again) and 1939. A final edition was published in 1946. In addition to the locomotive listings, photographs and dimensions, there are numerous essays on many aspects of GWR locomotive development.

On a related subject, the GWR also published in 1935 a 56-page booklet entitled &quot;Swindon Works and its place in Great Western Railway History&quot;. Illustrated with photographs on almost every opening, it recounts the history of the GWR as a locomotive-using and building company, the construction and development of Swindon Works, and the training of those employed there. It describes each section of the works, some of the latest locomotives to be built there, and finishes with various related organisations, from the Mechanics&#x27; Institution to the Annual Works Holiday.

===Art, media and literature===

The GWR attracted the attention of the artists from an early date. John Cooke Bourne&#x27;s &quot;History and Description of the Great Western Railway&quot; was published in 1846 and contained a series of detailed lithographs of the railway that give readers a glimpse of what the line looked like in the days before photography. J. M. W. Turner painted his &quot;Rain, Steam and Speed - The Great Western Railway&quot; in 1844 after looking out of the window of his train on Maidenhead Railway Bridge, and in 1862 William Powell Frith painted &quot;The Railway Station&quot;, a large crowd scene on the platform at Paddington. The station itself was initially painted for Powell by W Scott Morton, an architect, and a train was specially provided by the GWR for the painting, in front of which a variety of travellers and railway staff form an animated focal point.

In 1935, as part of the celebration of the centenary of the GWR, the railway commissioned and published &quot;Railway Ribaldry&quot;, a book of cartoons by W. Heath Robinson, giving that well-known cartoonist a free hand to re-imagine the history of the line for the amusement of its customers. The result is a 96-page softback book with alternating full-page cartoons and smaller vignettes, all on pertinent subjects.

The GWR has featured in many television programmes, such as the BBC children&#x27;s drama series &quot;God&#x27;s Wonderful Railway&quot; in 1980. It was also immortalised in Bob Godfrey&#x27;s animated film &quot;Great&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film of 1975 which tells the story of Brunel&#x27;s engineering accomplishments.

Sir John Betjeman mentions the GWR clearly in his poem &quot;Distant Views of a Provincial Town&quot;:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1.6em;&quot;&gt;The old Great Western Railway shakes,
The old Great Western Railway spins –
The old Great Western Railway makes
Me very sorry for my sins.&lt;/poem&gt;

===Heritage===


The GWR&#x27;s memory is kept alive by several museums such as STEAM – the museum of the GWR (in the old Swindon railway works), and the Didcot Railway Centre, where there is an operating broad-gauge train. Preserved GWR lines include those from Totnes to Buckfastleigh, Paignton to Kingswear, Bishops Lydeard to Minehead, Kidderminster to Bridgnorth and Cheltenham to Broadway. Many other heritage railways and museums also have GWR locomotives or rolling stock in use or on display.

Numerous stations owned by Network Rail also continue to display much of their GWR heritage. This is seen not only at the large stations such as Paddington (built 1851, extended 1915) and Temple Meads (1840, 1875 &amp; 1935) but other places such as Bath Spa (1840), (1878), (1879), (1897), and (1927). Many small stations are little changed from when they were opened, as there has been no need to rebuild them to cope with heavier traffic; good examples can be found at (1841), (1850, Network Rail&#x27;s last surviving Brunel-style train shed), (1857), and (1859). Even where stations have been rebuilt, many fittings such as signs, manhole covers and seats can still be found with &quot;GWR&quot; cast into them.

The Great Western Main Line was considered as a potential UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006 but rejected in 2011. The proposal comprised seven sites: Temple Meads (including Brunel&#x27;s GWR offices, boardroom, train shed, the B&amp;ER offices, and the bridge over the River Avon); Bath (including the route from Twerton Tunnel to Sydney Gardens); Middlehill and Box Tunnels; the Swindon area including Swindon railway works and village; Maidenhead Railway Bridge; Wharncliffe Viaduct; and Paddington station.

===Locomotives named &quot;Great Western&quot;===

Several locomotives have been given the name &quot;Great Western&quot;. The first was an Iron Duke class broad-gauge locomotive built in 1846, the first locomotive entirely constructed at the company&#x27;s Swindon Works. This was withdrawn in 1870, but in 1888 a newly built locomotive in the same class was given the same name; this was withdrawn four years later when the broad gauge was taken out of use. A standard-gauge 3031 class locomotive, number 3012, was then given the name. The last GWR locomotive to carry the name was Castle class number 7007, which continued to carry it in British Railways days.

The name later reappeared on some BR diesels. The first was 47500 which carried the name from 1979 until 1991. Another Class 47, this time 47815, had the name bestowed on it in 2005; it is currently (2009) in operation with Riviera Trains. High Speed Train power car number 43185 also carried the same name and was operated by the modern Great Western Railway until 18 May 2019.
==Notable people==
===Chairmen===
===Chief Engineers, Locomotive Superintendents, CMEs===

;Chief Engineer
*Isambard Kingdom Brunel - (1835–1859) Also engineered many of the broad-gauge lines with which the GWR amalgamated, and the standard-gauge Taff Vale Railway. He was responsible for choosing the route of the railway and designing many of today&#x27;s iconic structures including Box Tunnel, Royal Albert Bridge, Maidenhead Railway Bridge, and stations.
;Locomotive Superintendent

* Daniel Gooch - (1837–1864) Later the chairman (1865–1889). He was responsible for the railway&#x27;s early locomotive successes, such as the Iron Duke Class, and for establishing Swindon railway works.
*Joseph Armstrong - (1864–1877) Locomotive Superintendent to the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway and the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railways from 1853, he was responsible for the locomotive workshops at Wolverhampton. When they amalgamated with the GWR the following year he was given the title of Northern Division Locomotive Superintendent (1854–1864), he then moved to Swindon as the chief Locomotive Superintendent.
* William Dean - (1877–1902).
* George Jackson Churchward - (1902–1915) who instigated much standardisation of locomotive components.
;Chief Mechanical Engineer
* George Jackson Churchward - (1915–1921) The position was renamed.
* Charles Collett - (1922–1941).
* Frederick Hawksworth - (1941–1947) The last GWR Chief Mechanical Engineer.

===Others===
* George Armstrong, brother of Joseph, and Superintendent of the Northern Division (1864–1897) at Wolverhampton works, which he ran almost independently of Swindon. 
* James Grierson - Goods Manager (1857–1863), he then became the general manager (1863–1887) from which position he saw the railway through a period of expansion and the early gauge conversions.
* Henry Lambert - The general manager (1887–1896) responsible for managing the final gauge conversion in 1892.
* James Milne - General manager (1929–1947) who saw the GWR through World War II.
* Sir Felix Pole - As general manager (1921–1929) he oversaw the Grouping of the South Wales railways into the GWR following the Railways Act 1921, and promoted the use of 20 ton wagons to bring efficiencies to the railway&#x27;s coal trade.
* Charles Spagnoletti - The GWR&#x27;s Telegraph Superintendent (1855–1892) patented the Disc Block Telegraph Instrument that was used to safely control the dispatch of trains. First used on the Metropolitan Railway in 1863 and the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway in 1864, it was later used on many other lines operated by the company.
A number of engineers trained at or worked for the GWR, before moving to other companies, including:

<doc id="96881" wikidata="Q260205" url="?curid=96881" title="The Jungle">
<text>The Jungle is a novel by American author and muckraking-journalist Upton Sinclair, known for his efforts to expose corruption in government and business in the early 20th century. 
In 1904, Sinclair spent seven weeks gathering information while working incognito in the meatpacking plants of the Union Stock Yards in Chicago for the socialist newspaper &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;, which published his novel in serial form in 1905. The novel was later published in book format by Doubleday in 1906.

The book realistically depicts working-class poverty, immigrant struggle, lack of social support or welfare, harsh living and dangerous working conditions, generating hopelessness or cynicism and cruelty among the powerless. These elements are contrasted with the deeply rooted corruption of people in power. A review by Sinclair&#x27;s contemporary, writer Jack London, compared &quot;The Jungle&quot; to America&#x27;s most famous novel written to expose a cruel system, by calling it &quot;the &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; of wage slavery.&quot; 

While Sinclair in describing the meat industry and its working conditions wanted to advance socialism, the novel&#x27;s most immediate impact was to provoke public outcry over passages exposing health issues and unsanitary practices in the American meat-packing industry during the early 20th century. This led to sanitation reforms including the Meat Inspection Act and other product safety legislation.

==Plot summary==

Jurgis Rudkus marries his fifteen-year-old sweetheart, Ona Lukoszaite, in a joyous traditional Lithuanian wedding feast. They and their extended family have recently immigrated to Chicago due to financial hardship in Lithuania (then part of the Russian Empire). They have heard that America offers freedom and higher wages and have come to pursue the American Dream.

Despite having lost much of their savings being conned on the trip to Chicago, and then having to pay for the wedding—and despite the disappointment of arriving at a crowded boarding house—Jurgis is initially optimistic about his prospects in Chicago. Young and strong, he believes that he is immune to the misfortunes that have befallen others in the crowd. He is swiftly hired by a meatpacking factory; he marvels at its efficiency, even while witnessing the cruel treatment of the animals.

The women of the family answer an ad for a four-room house; Ona, who came from an educated background, figures that they could easily afford it with the jobs that Jurgis, proud Marija, and ambitious Jonas have gotten. While they discover at the showing that the neighborhood is unkempt and the house doesn&#x27;t live up to the advertisement, they are taken in by the slickness and fluent Lithuanian of the real estate agent and sign a contract for the house.

However, with the help of an old Lithuanian neighbor, they discover several unexpected expenses in the contract that they must pay every month on time, or else face eviction—the fate of most home buyers in the neighborhood. To meet these costs, Ona and thirteen-year-old Stanislovas (whom the family had wished to send to school) must take up work as well.

While sickness befalls them often, they cannot afford not to work. That winter, Jurgis&#x27;s father, weakened by exposure to chemicals and the elements at his job, dies of illness.

Some levity is brought to their lives by the arrival of a musician, named Tamoszius, who courts Marija, and the birth of Jurgis and Ona&#x27;s first child. However, this happiness is tempered when Ona must return to work one week after giving birth, and Marija is laid off in a seasonal cutback. Jurgis attends union meetings passionately; he realizes that he had been taken in by a vote-buying scheme when he was new to Chicago, learns that the meat factories deliberately use diseased meat, and furthermore that workers frequently come down with ailments related to their dangerous and unsanitary work.

Work becomes more demanding as wages fall; the working members of the family suffer a series of injuries. Amid this hardship, Jonas deserts the family, leaving them no choice but to send two children to work as newspaper boys. The youngest child, a handicapped toddler, dies of food poisoning; only his mother grieves his death.

After recovering from his injury, Jurgis takes the least desirable job at a fertilizer mill. In misery, he begins drinking alcohol. He becomes suspicious of his pregnant wife&#x27;s failure to return home on several nights. Ona eventually confesses that her boss, Phil Connor raped her, after which, by threatening to fire and blacklist everyone in her family, he managed to coerce her into a continuing sexual relationship.

Jurgis furiously attacks Connor at his factory, but half a dozen men tear him away. While in prison awaiting trial, he realizes it is Christmas Eve. The next day, his cellmate, Jack Duane, tells him about his criminal ventures and gives him his address. At trial, Connor testifies that he had fired Ona for &quot;impudence&quot; and easily denies Jurgis&#x27;s account; the judge dismissively sentences Jurgis to thirty days in prison plus court fees.

Stanislovas visits Jurgis in prison and tells him of the family&#x27;s increasing destitution. After Jurgis serves his term (plus three days for his inability to pay the fees), he walks through the slush for an entire day to get home, only to find that the house had been remodeled and sold to another family. He learns from their old neighbor that, despite all of the sacrifices they had made, his family had been evicted and had returned to the boarding house.

Upon arriving at the boarding house, Jurgis heard Ona screaming. She is in premature labor, and Marija explains that the family had no money for a doctor. Jurgis convinces a midwife to assist, but it is too little too late; the infant is dead, and with one last look at Jurgis, Ona dies shortly afterward. The children return with a day&#x27;s wages; Jurgis spends all of it to get drunk for the night.

The next morning, Ona&#x27;s stepmother begs Jurgis to think of his surviving child. With his son in mind, he endeavors again to gain employment despite his blacklisting. For a time, the family gets by and Jurgis delights in his son&#x27;s first attempts at speech. One day, Jurgis arrives home to discover that his son had drowned after falling off a rotting boardwalk into the muddy streets. Without shedding a tear, he walks away from Chicago.

Jurgis wanders the countryside while the weather is warm, working, foraging, and stealing for food, shelter, and drink. In the fall, he returns to Chicago, sometimes employed, sometimes a tramp. While begging, he chances upon an eccentric rich drunk—the son of the owner of the first factory where Jurgis had worked—who entertains him for the night in his luxurious mansion and gives him a one-hundred-dollar bill (worth the equivalent of about $3,500 as of October of 2024). Afterward, when Jurgis spends the bill at a bar, the bartender cheats him. Jurgis attacks the bartender and is sentenced to prison again, where he once again meets Jack Duane. This time, without a family to anchor him, Jurgis decides to fall in with him.

Jurgis helps Duane mug a well-off man; his split of the loot is worth over twenty times a day&#x27;s wages from his first job. Though his conscience is pricked by learning of the man&#x27;s injuries in the next day&#x27;s papers, he justifies it to himself as necessary in a &quot;dog-eat-dog&quot; world. Jurgis then navigates the world of crime; he learns that this includes a substantial corruption of the police department. He becomes a vote fixer for a wealthy political powerhouse, Mike Scully, and arranges for many new Slavic immigrants to vote according to Scully&#x27;s wishes—as Jurgis once had. To influence those men, he had taken a job at a factory, which he continues as a strikebreaker. One night, by chance, he runs into Connor, whom he attacks again. Afterward, he discovers that his buddies cannot fix the trial as Connor is an important figure under Scully. With the help of a friend, he posts and skips bail.

With no other options, Jurgis returns to begging and chances upon a woman who had been a guest to his wedding. She tells him where to find Marija, and Jurgis heads to the address to find that it is a brothel being raided by the police. Marija tells him that she was forced to prostitute herself to feed the children after they had gotten sick, and Stanislovas—who had drunk too much and passed out at work—had been eaten by rats. After their speedy trial and release, Marija tells Jurgis that she cannot leave the brothel as she cannot save money and has become addicted to heroin, as is typical in the brothel&#x27;s human trafficking.

Marija has a customer, so Jurgis leaves and finds a political meeting for a warm place to stay. He begins to nod off. A refined lady gently rouses him, saying, &quot;If you would try to listen, comrade, perhaps you would be interested.&quot; Startled by her kindness and fascinated by her passion, he listens to the thundering speaker. Enraptured by his speech, Jurgis seeks out the orator afterward. The orator asks if he is interested in socialism.

A Polish socialist takes him into his home, conversing with him about his life and socialism. Jurgis returns home to Ona&#x27;s stepmother and passionately converts her to socialism; she placatingly goes along with it only because it seems to motivate him to find work. He finds work in a small hotel that turns out to be run by a state organizer of the Socialist Party. Jurgis passionately dedicates his life to the cause of socialism.

==Publication history==
Sinclair published the book in serial form between February 25, 1905, and November 4, 1905, in &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;, the socialist newspaper that had supported Sinclair&#x27;s undercover investigation the previous year. This investigation had inspired Sinclair to write the novel, but his efforts to publish the series as a book met with resistance. An employee at Macmillan wrote, 
Five publishers rejected the work, deeming it too shocking for mainstream audiences. Sinclair was about to self-publish a shortened version of the novel in a &quot;Sustainer&#x27;s Edition&quot; for subscribers when Doubleday, Page came on board; on February 28, 1906, the Doubleday edition was published simultaneously with Sinclair&#x27;s of 5,000 which appeared under the imprint of &quot;The Jungle Publishing Company&quot; with the Socialist Party’s symbol embossed on the cover, both using the same plates. In the first six weeks, the book sold 25,000 copies. It has been in print ever since, including four more self-published editions (1920, 1935, 1942, 1945). Sinclair dedicated the book &quot;To the Workingmen of America&quot;.

All works published in the United States before 1924 are in the public domain, so there are free copies of the book available on websites such as Project Gutenberg and Wikisource.

===Uncensored editions===

In 1988, St. Lukes Press, a division of Peachtree Publishers Ltd, published an edition titled &quot;The Lost First Edition of Upton Sinclair&#x27;s The Jungle&quot; based on the original serialized version of &quot;The Jungle&quot; as seen in &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;. This version was edited by Gene Degruson of Pittsburg State University, based on a correspondence regarding the novel found in the basement of a farm in Girard, Kansas. The book included an introductory essay by DeGruson detailing the process of how he &quot;restored&quot; the text.

In 2003, See Sharp Press published an edition based on the original serialization of &quot;The Jungle&quot; in &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;, which they described as the &quot;Uncensored Original Edition&quot; as Sinclair intended it. The foreword and introduction say that the commercial editions were censored to make their political message acceptable to capitalist publishers. Others argue that Sinclair had made the revisions himself to make the novel more accurate and engaging for the reader, corrected the Lithuanian references, and streamlined to eliminate parts that would not appeal to the public, as Sinclair himself said in letters and his memoir &quot;American Outpost&quot; (1932).

==Reception==

The publisher hyped the book . Isaac F. Marcosson handled publicity. He sent the entire book in page proof to the Associated Press, the United Press, and the Hearst newspaper chain, as well as to the managing editors of each of the leading big-city newspapers. He told them they were free to quote at length when the book was officially released. The Muckraker publishers and editors were hunting scandal and most newspapers responded eagerly with a sensational story that affected every reader. In cities large and small all across the country the scandals were rehashed, often with page one coverage. The book sold tens of thousands of copies, but the newspapers reached millions.

The scandal brought Sinclair national fame. He intended to expose &quot;the inferno of exploitation [of the typical American factory worker at the turn of the 20th Century]&quot;, but the reading public fixated on food safety as most pressing issue. Sinclair admitted his celebrity arose &quot;not because the public cared anything about the workers, but simply because the public did not want to eat tubercular beef&quot;.

Sinclair&#x27;s account of workers falling into rendering tanks and being ground along with animal parts into &quot;Durham&#x27;s Pure Leaf Lard&quot; gripped the public--although it never happened. Historians of the ethnic workers reject the emphasis on their horrible lives and instead celebrate their successful rise in status and community building. 

The British politician Winston Churchill praised the book in a review. Bertolt Brecht took up the theme of terrible working conditions at the Chicago Stockyards in his play &quot;Saint Joan of the Stockyards&quot; (), transporting Joan of Arc to that environment.

In 1933, the book became a target of the Nazi book burnings due to Sinclair&#x27;s endorsement of socialism.

===Federal response===
President Theodore Roosevelt had described Sinclair as a &quot;crackpot&quot; because of the writer&#x27;s socialist positions. He wrote privately to journalist William Allen White, expressing doubts about the accuracy of Sinclair&#x27;s claims: &quot;I have an utter contempt for him. He is hysterical, unbalanced, and untruthful. Three-fourths of the things he said were absolute falsehoods. For some of the remainder there was only a basis of truth.&quot; After reading &quot;The Jungle&quot;, Roosevelt agreed with some of Sinclair&#x27;s conclusions. The president wrote &quot;radical action must be taken to do away with the efforts of arrogant and selfish greed on the part of the capitalist.&quot; He assigned the Labor Commissioner Charles P. Neill and social worker James Bronson Reynolds to go to Chicago to investigate some meat packing facilities.

Learning about the visit, owners had their workers thoroughly clean the factories prior to the inspection, but Neill and Reynolds were still revolted by the conditions. Their oral report to Roosevelt supported much of what Sinclair portrayed in the novel, excepting the claim of workers falling into rendering vats. Neill testified before Congress that the men had reported only &quot;such things as showed the necessity for legislation.&quot; That year, the Bureau of Animal Industry issued a report rejecting Sinclair&#x27;s most severe allegations, characterizing them as &quot;intentionally misleading and false&quot;, &quot;willful and deliberate misrepresentations of fact&quot;, and &quot;utter absurdity&quot;.

Roosevelt did not release the Neill–Reynolds Report for publication. His administration submitted it directly to Congress on June 4, 1906. With powerful Republicans opposing reforms that would prove costly to the packers, a compromise deal was brokered by Roosevelt that gave the reformers much of what they wanted, but not all. Public pressure led to the passage of the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act; the latter established the Bureau of Chemistry (in 1930 renamed as the Food and Drug Administration).

Sinclair rejected the legislation, which he considered an unjustified boon to large meatpackers. The government (and taxpayers) would bear the costs of inspection, estimated at $30,000,000 annually. He complained about the public&#x27;s misunderstanding of the point of his book in &quot;Cosmopolitan Magazine&quot; in October 1906 by saying, &quot;I aimed at the public&#x27;s heart, and by accident I hit it in the stomach.&quot;

==Adaptations==
The first film version of the novel was made in 1914, but it has since been lost.

&quot;Saint Joan of the Stockyards&quot; is a play set in Chicago written by the German modernist playwright Bertolt Brecht between 1929 and 1931, after the success of his musical &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; and during the period of his radical experimental work with the &quot;Lehrstücke&quot;. It is based on the musical that he co-authored with Elisabeth Hauptmann, &quot;Happy End&quot; (1929). 

In July 2019, Penguin Random House&#x27;s &quot;Ten Speed Graphic&quot; imprint published a version of the story, adapted and illustrated by Kristina Gehrmann and translated by Ivanka Hahnenberger.

<text>Reginald Aubrey Fessenden (October 6, 1866 – July 22, 1932) was a Canadian electrical engineer and inventor who received hundreds of patents in fields related to radio and sonar between 1891 and 1936 (seven of them after his death).

Fessenden pioneered developments in radio technology, including the foundations of amplitude modulation (AM) radio. His achievements included the first transmission of speech by radio (1900), and the first two-way radiotelegraphic communication across the Atlantic Ocean (1906). In 1932 he reported that, in late 1906, he also made the first radio broadcast of entertainment and music, although that claim has not been well documented.

He did a majority of his work in the United States and, in addition to his Canadian citizenship, claimed U.S. citizenship through his American-born father.

==Early years==
Reginald Fessenden was born October 6, 1866, in East Bolton, Canada East, the eldest of the Reverend Elisha Joseph Fessenden and Clementina Trenholme&#x27;s four children. Elisha Fessenden was a Church of England in Canada minister, and the family moved to a number of postings throughout the province of Ontario.
While growing up Fessenden attended a number of educational institutions. At the young age of nine he was enrolled in the DeVeaux Military school for a year. He next attended Trinity College School in Port Hope, Ontario, from 1877 until the summer of 1879. He also spent a year working for the Imperial Bank at Woodstock because he had not yet reached the age of 16 needed to enroll in college.

At the age of fourteen, he returned to his hometown in the Eastern Townships and went to the nearby Bishop&#x27;s College School, which granted him a mathematics mastership (teaching job) and a scholarship for studying in its college division at University of Bishop&#x27;s College. Thus, while Fessenden was still a teenager, he taught mathematics to the school&#x27;s younger students (some older than himself) for four years, while simultaneously studying natural sciences with older students at the college.

At the age of eighteen, Fessenden left Bishop&#x27;s without having been awarded a degree, although he had &quot;done substantially all the work necessary&quot;, in order to accept a position at the Whitney Institute, near to Flatts Village in Bermuda, where for the next two years he worked as the headmaster and sole teacher. (This lack of a degree may have hurt Fessenden&#x27;s employment opportunities. When McGill University in Montreal established an electrical engineering department, his application to become its chairman was turned down.) While in Bermuda, he became engaged to Helen May Trott of Smith&#x27;s Parish. They married on September 21, 1890, in the United States at Manhattan in New York City, and later had a son, Reginald Kennelly Fessenden, born May 7, 1893, in Lafayette, Allen, Indiana.

==Early work==
Fessenden&#x27;s classical education provided him with only a limited amount of scientific and technical training. Interested in increasing his skills in the electrical field, he moved to New York City in 1886, with hopes of gaining employment with the famous inventor, Thomas Edison. However, his initial attempts were rebuffed; in his first application Fessenden wrote, &quot;Do not know anything about electricity, but can learn pretty quick,&quot; to which Edison replied, &quot;Have enough men now who do not know about electricity.&quot; However, Fessenden persevered, and before the end of the year was hired for a semi-skilled position as an assistant tester for the Edison Machine Works, which was laying underground electrical mains in New York City. He quickly proved his worth, and received a series of promotions, with increasing responsibility for the project. In late 1886, Fessenden began working directly for Edison at the inventor&#x27;s new laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey, as a junior technician. He participated in a broad range of projects, which included work in solving problems in chemistry, metallurgy, and electricity. However, in 1890, facing financial problems, Edison was forced to lay off most of the laboratory employees, including Fessenden. (Fessenden remained an admirer of Edison his entire life, and in 1925 stated that &quot;there is only one figure in history which stands in the same rank as him as an inventor, &quot;i. e.&quot; Archimedes&quot;.)

Taking advantage of his recent practical experience, Fessenden was able to find positions with a series of manufacturing companies. In 1892, he received an appointment as professor for the newly formed Electrical Engineering department at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana; while there he helped the Westinghouse Corporation install the lighting for the 1893 Chicago World Columbian Exposition. Later that year, George Westinghouse personally recruited Fessenden for the newly created position of chair of the Electrical Engineering department at the Western University of Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh (now the University of Pittsburgh).

==Radio work==
In the late 1890s, reports began to appear about the success Guglielmo Marconi was having in developing a practical system of transmitting and receiving radio signals, then commonly known as &quot;wireless telegraphy&quot;. Fessenden began limited radio experimentation, and soon came to the conclusion that he could develop a far more efficient system than the spark-gap transmitter and coherer-receiver combination which had been created by Oliver Lodge and Marconi. By 1899 he was able to send radiotelegraph messages between Pittsburgh and Allegheny City (now an area of Pittsburgh), using a receiver of his own design.

===Weather Bureau contract===

In 1900 Fessenden left Pittsburgh to work for the United States Weather Bureau, with the objective of demonstrating the practicality of using coastal stations to transmit weather information, thereby avoiding the expense of the existing telegraph lines. The contract called for him to be paid $3,000 per year and provided with work space, assistance, and housing. Fessenden would retain ownership of any inventions, but the agreement also gave the Weather Bureau royalty-free use of any discoveries made during the term of the contract. Fessenden quickly made major advances, especially in receiver design, as he worked to develop audio reception of signals. His initial success came from the invention of a barretter detector. This was followed by an electrolytic detector, consisting of a fine wire dipped in nitric acid, which for the next few years set the standard for sensitivity in radio reception.

As his work progressed, Fessenden also developed the heterodyne principle, which used two closely spaced radio signals to produce an audible tone that made Morse code transmissions much easier to hear. However, heterodyne reception would not become practical for a decade after it was invented, because it required a method for producing a stable local signal, which would not become available until the development of the oscillating vacuum-tube.

Fessenden&#x27;s initial Weather Bureau work took place at Cobb Island, Maryland, located in the Potomac River about downstream from Washington, D.C. As the experimentation expanded, additional stations were built along the Atlantic Coast in North Carolina and Virginia. However, in the midst of promising advances, Fessenden became embroiled in disputes with his sponsor. In particular, he charged that Bureau Chief Willis Moore had attempted to gain a half-share of the patents. Fessenden refused to sign over the rights, and his work for the Weather Bureau ended in August 1902.

===National Electric Signaling Company===
In November 1902, two wealthy Pittsburgh businessmen, Hay Walker Jr. and Thomas H. Given, financed the formation of the National Electric Signaling Company (NESCO) to support Fessenden&#x27;s research. Initially the new company was based in Washington, D.C., where a station was constructed for experimental and demonstration purposes. Two additional demonstration stations were constructed at Collingswood, New Jersey (near Philadelphia) and Jersey City, New Jersey (near New York City). In 1904 an attempt was made to link the General Electric plants in Schenectady, New York, and Lynn, Massachusetts, a distance of , however the effort was unsuccessful.

Efforts to sell equipment to the U.S. and other governments, as well as private companies, met with little success. An ongoing area of conflict, especially with the U.S. Navy, were the high prices Fessenden tried to charge. The Navy in particular felt Fessenden&#x27;s quotes were too far above the device&#x27;s manufacturing costs to be considered reasonable, and contracted with other companies to build equipment that used Fessenden designs. This led to bad feelings and a series of patent infringement lawsuits. An alternate plan to sell the company as a whole was unsuccessful in finding a buyer. Eventually a radical change in company orientation took place. In 1904 it was decided to compete with the existing ocean cables, by setting up a transatlantic radiotelegraph link. The headquarters for company operations was moved to Brant Rock, Massachusetts, which was to be the western terminal for the proposed new service.

=== Rotary-spark transmitter and the first two-way transatlantic transmission ===

The plan was to conduct the transatlantic service using Fessenden-designed rotary spark-gap transmitters. A 420-foot (128 meter) guyed antenna was constructed at Brant Rock, with a similar tower erected at Machrihanish in western Scotland. In January 1906, these stations made the first successful two-way transmission across the Atlantic, exchanging Morse code messages. (Marconi had only achieved one-way transmissions at this time.) However, the system was unable to reliably bridge this distance when the sun was up, or during the summer months when interference levels were higher, so work was suspended until later in the year. Then, on December 6, 1906, the Machrihanish radio tower collapsed in a gale, abruptly ending the transatlantic project before it could begin commercial service. (A detailed review in &quot;Engineering&quot; magazine blamed the collapse on sub-standard construction, due to &quot;the way in which the joints were made by the man employed for the purpose by the sub-contractors to whom the work was entrusted by the Brown Hoisting Machinery Company&quot; and &quot;The only wonder is that the tower did not fall before.&quot;)

In a letter published in the January 19, 1907, issue of &quot;Scientific American&quot;, Fessenden discounted the effect of the tower collapse, stating that &quot;The working up to the date of the accident was, however, so successful that the directors of the National Electric Signaling Company have decided that it is unnecessary to carry on the experimental developments any further, and specifications are being drawn up for the erection of five stations for doing transatlantic and other cable work, and a commercial permit is being applied for in England.&quot; However, the tower collapse did in fact mark the end of NESCO&#x27;s transatlantic efforts.

===Audio transmissions===
Fessenden had a very early interest in the possibility of making audio radio transmissions, in contrast to the early spark-gap transmissions that could only transmit Morse code messages. As early as 1891, he had investigated sending alternating currents of varying frequencies along telegraph lines, in order to create a multiplex telegraph system. He would later apply the knowledge gained about tuning and resonance from his alternating current electrical work to the higher frequency currents used in radio, in order to develop the concept of continuous-wave radio signals.

Fessenden&#x27;s basic approach was disclosed in U.S. Patent 706,737, which he applied for on May 29, 1901, and was issued the next year. It called for the use of a high-speed alternator (referred to as &quot;an alternating-current dynamo&quot;) that generated &quot;pure sine waves&quot; and produced &quot;a continuous train of radiant waves of substantially uniform strength&quot;, or, in modern terminology, a continuous-wave (CW) transmitter. The idea of using continuous-wave radio signals was in direct conflict with the current orthodoxy that the abrupt &quot;whiplash&quot; effect produced by large electrical sparks was needed in order to create adequately strong signals. John Ambrose Fleming, a Marconi associate, was particularly dismissive in his book &quot;The Principles of Electric Wave Telegraphy&quot;, a detailed review of the state of the art as he saw it that was published in 1906. Reviewing Fessenden&#x27;s patent, he wrote that &quot;The creation of an electric wave seems to involve a certain suddenness in the beginning of the oscillations, and an alternator giving a simple sine-curve would not be likely to produce the required effect...&quot; (In view of Fessenden&#x27;s ultimate success, this statement disappeared from the book&#x27;s 1916 edition.) Fessenden&#x27;s next step, taken from standard wire-telephone practice, was to insert a simple carbon microphone into the transmission line, which was used to modulate the carrier wave signal for audio transmissions, or, again using modern terms, used to produce amplitude modulated (AM) radio signals.

Fessenden began his research on audio transmissions while still on Cobb Island. Because he did not yet have a continuous-wave transmitter, initially he worked with an experimental &quot;high-frequency spark&quot; transmitter, taking advantage of the fact that the higher the spark rate, the closer a spark-gap transmission comes to producing continuous waves. He later reported that, on December 23, 1900, he successfully transmitted speech over a distance of about 1.6 kilometers (one mile), saying; “One, two, three, four. Is It snowing where you are, Mr. Thiessen? If so, telegraph back and let me know”, which appears to have been the first successful audio transmission using radio signals. However, at this time the sound was far too distorted to be commercially practical, although as a test this did show that with further refinements it would become possible to effectively transmit sounds by radio. 

For a time Fessenden continued working with more sophisticated high-frequency spark transmitters, including versions that used compressed air, which began to take on some of the characteristics of arc-transmitters patented by Valdemar Poulsen. Fessenden unsuccessfully attempted to sell this form of radiotelephone, later noting: &quot;In 1904, with a 20,000 frequency spark and compressed nitrogen gap, such good results were obtained that a demonstration was given to a number of electrical engineers, who signed affidavits that they considered the articulation as commercially good over twenty-five miles, and the sets were advertised for sale...&quot; (In a 1908 review, he conceded that with this approach &quot;The transmission was, however, still not absolutely perfect.&quot;)

===Alternator-transmitter===
Fessenden&#x27;s ultimate plan for an audio-capable transmitter was to take a basic electrical alternator, which normally rotated at speeds that produced alternating current of at most a few hundred cycles-per-second (Hz), and greatly increase its rotational speed, in order to create electrical currents of tens-of-thousands of cycles-per-second (kHz), thus producing a steady continuous-wave transmission when connected to an aerial. However, it would take many years of expensive development before even a prototype alternator-transmitter would be ready, and a few years beyond that for high-power versions to become available. One concern was whether at these high speeds the alternator might disintegrate due to the high rotation speed tearing it apart. Because of this, as a precaution, while the alternator was being initially developed it was &quot;placed in a pit surrounded by sandbags&quot;.

Fessenden contracted with General Electric (GE) to help design and produce a series of high-frequency alternator-transmitters. In 1903, Charles Proteus Steinmetz of GE delivered a 10 kHz version which proved of limited use and could not be directly used as a radio transmitter. Fessenden&#x27;s request for a faster, more powerful unit was assigned to Ernst F. W. Alexanderson, who in August 1906 delivered an improved model which operated at a transmitting frequency of approximately 50 kHz, although with far less power than Fessenden&#x27;s rotary-spark transmitters.

The alternator-transmitter achieved the goal of transmitting quality audio signals, but the lack of any way to amplify the signals meant they were somewhat weak. On December 21, 1906, Fessenden made an extensive demonstration of the new alternator-transmitter at Brant Rock, showing its utility for point-to-point wireless telephony, including interconnecting his stations to the wire telephone network. As part of the demonstration, speech was transmitted 18 kilometers (11 miles) to a listening site at Plymouth, Massachusetts. A detailed review of this demonstration appeared in &quot;The American Telephone Journal&quot; and a summary by Fessenden appeared in &quot;Scientific American&quot;. A portion of a report produced by Greenleaf W. Pickard of the Telephone Company&#x27;s Boston office, which includes additional information on some still existing defects, appeared in Ernst Ruhmer&#x27;s &quot;Wireless Telephony in Theory and Practice&quot;.

Although primarily designed for transmissions spanning a few kilometers, on a couple of occasions the test Brant Rock audio transmissions were apparently overheard by NESCO employee James C. Armor across the Atlantic at the Machrihanish site.

===First entertainment radio broadcast===
Until the early 1930s, it was generally accepted that Lee de Forest, who conducted a series of test broadcasts beginning in 1907, and who was widely quoted promoting the potential of organized radio broadcasting, was the first person to transmit music and entertainment by radio. De Forest&#x27;s first entertainment broadcast occurred in February 1907, when he transmitted electronic telharmonium music from his laboratory station in New York City. This was followed by tests that included, in the fall, Eugenia Farrar singing &quot;I Love You Truly&quot;. (Beginning in 1904, the U.S. Navy had broadcast daily time signals and weather reports, but these employed spark transmitters, transmitting in Morse code).

In 1928, as part of a lecture reviewing &quot;The Early History of Radio in the United States&quot;, H. P. Davis, commenting on entertainment offerings, asserted that &quot;Reginald Fessenden, probably the first to attempt this, broadcast a program Christmas Eve 1906&quot;, but did not provide any additional details, and his comment was little noticed at the time.

The first widely publicized information about Fessenden&#x27;s early broadcasts did not appear until 1932, when an article prepared by former Fessenden associate Samuel M. Kintner, &quot;Pittsburgh&#x27;s Contributions to Radio&quot;, appeared in the December 1932 issue of &quot;The Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers&quot;. This reviewed information included in a January 29, 1932, letter sent by Fessenden to Kintner. (Fessenden subsequently died five months before Kintner&#x27;s article appeared). In this account, Fessenden reported that on the evening of December 24, 1906 (Christmas Eve), he had made the first of two radio broadcasts of music and entertainment to a general audience, using the alternator-transmitter at Brant Rock. Fessenden remembered producing a short program that included a phonograph record of Ombra mai fu (Largo) by George Frideric Handel, followed by Fessenden playing Adolphe Adam&#x27;s carol &quot;O Holy Night&quot; on the violin and singing &quot;Adore and be Still&quot; by Gounod, and closing with a biblical passage: &quot;Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to men of good will&quot; (Luke 2:14). He also stated that a second short program was broadcast on December 31 (New Year&#x27;s Eve). The intended audience for both of these transmissions was primarily shipboard radio operators along the Atlantic seaboard. Fessenden claimed that the two programs had been widely publicized in advance, and the Christmas Eve broadcast had been heard &quot;as far down&quot; as Norfolk, Virginia, while the New Year Eve&#x27;s broadcast had reached listeners in the West Indies.

Anticipation of the 2006 centennial anniversary of Fessenden&#x27;s reported broadcasts brought renewed interest, as well as additional questions. A key issue was why, despite Fessenden&#x27;s assertion that the two programs had been widely heard, there did not appear to be any independent corroborating evidence for his account. (Even the Helen Fessenden biography relies exclusively on details contained in the January 29, 1932, letter used by the Kintner article.) There was general consensus in the centennial discussions that Fessenden had the technical means to make broadcasts, given the widespread reports about the success of the December 21 alternator-transmitter demonstrations. However, because of the station&#x27;s very low power, even if the broadcasts had taken place it was questionable if the range could have matched Fessenden&#x27;s claim of being heard hundreds of kilometers away.

In the period leading up to the centennial, James E. O&#x27;Neal conducted extensive research, but did not find any ships&#x27; radio log accounts, or any contemporary literature, to confirm the reported holiday broadcasts. A follow-up article two years later further reported that a similar attempt to verify the details of the broadcasts had taken place in 1956, which had also failed to uncover any confirmation of Fessenden&#x27;s statements. One alternate possibility proposed by O&#x27;Neal was that perhaps something similar to what Fessenden remembered could have taken place during a series of tests conducted in 1909. A review by Donna L. Halper and Christopher H. Sterling suggested that debating the existence of the holiday broadcasts was ignoring the fact that, in their opinion, the December 21 demonstration, which included the playing of a phonograph record, in itself qualified to be considered an entertainment broadcast. Jack Belrose flatly argued that there was no reason to doubt Fessenden&#x27;s account, in part because it had not been challenged in the years immediately following publication of the Kintner article. Although Fessenden&#x27;s claim for the first radio broadcast in 1906 is recognized as an IEEE Milestone, in view of the contrasting opinions among radio historians, Mike Adams summarized the situation as &quot;More than 100 years after its possible occurrence, the Fessenden &#x27;first broadcaster&#x27; controversy continues.&quot;

The &quot;American Telephone Journal&quot; account of the December 21 alternator-transmitter demonstration included the statement that &quot;It is admirably adapted to the transmission of news, music, etc. as, owing to the fact that no wires are needed, simultaneous transmission to many subscribers can be effected as easily as to a few&quot;, echoing the words of a handout distributed to the demonstration witnesses, which stated &quot;[Radio] Telephony is admirably adapted for transmitting news, stock quotations, music, race reports, etc. simultaneously over a city, on account of the fact that no wires are needed and a single apparatus can distribute to ten thousand subscribers as easily as to a few. It is proposed to erect stations for this purpose in the large cities here and abroad.&quot; However, other than the two reported holiday transmissions, Fessenden does not appear to have conducted any other radio broadcasts, or to have even given additional thought about the potential of a regular broadcast service. In a 1908 comprehensive review of &quot;Wireless Telephony&quot;, he included a section titled &quot;possibilities&quot; that listed promising radio telephone uses. Neither the main article, nor this list, makes any reference to broadcasting, instead only noting conventional applications of point-to-point communication, enumerated as &quot;local exchanges&quot;, &quot;long-distance lines&quot;, &quot;transmarine transmission&quot;, &quot;wireless telephony from ship to ship&quot;, and &quot;wireless telephone from ship to local exchange&quot;.

===Continuing work and dismissal from NESCO===
The technical achievements made by Fessenden were not matched by financial success. Walker and Given continued to hope to sell NESCO to a larger company such as the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T). After the December 21, 1906, demonstrations, AT&amp;T was said to be planning to acquire NESCO, but financial setbacks caused the telephone company to reconsider, and NESCO was unable to find another buyer. There were growing strains between Fessenden and the company owners, and Fessenden&#x27;s formation of the Fessenden Wireless Company of Canada in Montreal in 1906 may have led to suspicion that he was trying to freeze Walker and Given out of a potentially lucrative competing transatlantic service. The final break occurred in January 1911, when Fessenden was formally dismissed from NESCO. This resulted in his bringing suit against NESCO, for breach of contract. Fessenden won the initial court trial and was awarded damages; however, NESCO prevailed on appeal. To conserve assets, NESCO went into receivership in 1912, and Samuel Kintner was appointed general manager of the company. The legal stalemate would continue for over 15 years. In 1917, NESCO finally emerged from receivership, and was soon renamed the International Radio Telegraph Company. The company limped along for a few years, until it was sold to the Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company in 1920, and the next year its assets, including numerous important Fessenden patents, were sold to the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), which also inherited the longstanding Fessenden legal proceedings. Finally, on March 31, 1928, Fessenden settled his outstanding lawsuits with RCA, receiving a significant cash settlement.

==Later years==
After Fessenden left NESCO, Ernst Alexanderson continued to work on alternator-transmitter development at General Electric, mostly for long range radiotelegraph use. He eventually developed the high-powered Alexanderson alternator, capable of transmitting across the Atlantic, and by 1916 the Fessenden-Alexanderson alternator was more reliable for transoceanic communication than the spark transmitters which were originally used to provide this service. Also, after 1920 radio broadcasting became widespread, and although the stations used vacuum-tube transmitters rather than alternator-transmitters (which vacuum-tubes made obsolete), they employed the same continuous-wave AM signals that Fessenden had introduced in 1906.

Although Fessenden ceased radio research after his dismissal from NESCO in 1911, he continued to work in other fields. As early as 1904 he had helped engineer the Niagara Falls power plant for the newly formed Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario. However, his most extensive work was in marine communication as consulting engineer with the Submarine Signal Company which built a widely used aid to navigation using bells, termed a submarine signal, acting much as an underwater foghorn. While there, he invented the Fessenden oscillator, an electromechanical transducer. Though the company immediately began replacing bells and primitive receivers on ships with the new device, it was also the basis for entirely new applications: underwater telegraphy and sonic distance measurement. The later was the basis for sonar (SOund NAvigation Ranging), echo-sounding and the principle applied to radar (RAdio Detection And Ranging). The device was soon put to use for submarines to signal each other, as well as a method for locating icebergs, to help avoid another disaster like the one that sank &quot;Titanic&quot;. While the company quickly applied his invention to replace the bells of its systems and entered acoustic telegraphy it ignored the echo ranging potential. The echo sounding was invented in 1912 by German physicist Alexander Behm. 

At the outbreak of World War I, Fessenden volunteered his services to the Canadian government and was sent to London where he developed a device to detect enemy artillery and another to locate enemy submarines. Other efforts included a version of microfilm, that helped him to keep a compact record of his inventions, projects and patents. He also patented the basic ideas leading to reflection seismology, a technique important for its use in exploring for petroleum, and received patents for diverse subjects that included tracer bullets, paging, television apparatus, and a turbo electric drive for ships.

An inveterate tinkerer, Fessenden eventually became the holder of more than 500 patents. He could often be found in a river or lake, floating on his back, a cigar sticking out of his mouth and a hat pulled down over his eyes. At home he liked to lie on the carpet, a cat on his chest. In this state of relaxation, Fessenden could imagine, invent and think his way to new ideas. Fessenden also had a reputation for being temperamental, although in his defense his wife later stated that &quot;Fessenden was never a difficult man to W O R K with but he was an intensely difficult man to play politics with.&quot; However, one of his former assistants, Charles J. Pannill, recalled that &quot;He was a great character, of splendid physique, but what a temper!&quot;, while a second, Roy Weagant, ruefully noted that &quot;He could be very nice at times, but only at times.&quot;

In 1925, &quot;Radio News&quot;, saluting Fessenden as &quot;one of the greatest American radio inventors&quot;, began a monthly autobiographical series titled &quot;The Inventions of Reginald A. Fessenden&quot;, with the intention of publishing the completed installments as a book. However, instead of reviewing his radio work, Fessenden immediately went on a series of tangents, including discussions of which races he believed were the most capable of producing inventions, and the proper approach that government institutions should be taking in order to support inventors. (At the close of the seventh installment, &quot;Radio News&quot; included a disclaimer that it was &quot;not responsible for any opinions expressed in Dr. Fessenden&#x27;s article&quot;.) After eleven installments Fessenden had only covered his life up to 1893, having discussed virtually nothing about radio, and the series was quietly terminated at this point.

==Awards==
In 1921, the Institute of Radio Engineers presented Fessenden with its IRE Medal of Honor. The medallion was gold plated, and somehow Fessenden became convinced that earlier awards had been solid gold, so he angrily returned it. Only after Greenleaf W. Pickard investigated the matter and determined that the prior medals were also plated was Fessenden willing to relent. The next year Philadelphia&#x27;s Board of Directors of City Trusts awarded Fessenden a John Scott Medal, which included a cash prize of $800, for &quot;his invention of a reception scheme for continuous wave telegraphy and telephony&quot;, and recognized him as &quot;One whose labors had been of great benefit.&quot; There was suspicion by Fessenden that these two awards had not been made in sincerity but in order to placate him. In his wife&#x27;s biography, referring to the IRE medal, she quoted the proverb &quot;beware of Greeks bearing gifts&quot;. The Scott Medal came under additional suspicion because it had been awarded at the suggestion of Westinghouse engineers, who were working for a company that had had financial disputes with Fessenden. In Helen Fessenden&#x27;s opinion, &quot;The Medal cost [Westinghouse] nothing and was a good &#x27;sop to Cereberus&#x27;&quot;, and overall compared the medals to &quot;small change for tips in the pockets of Big Business&quot;. In 1929 Fessenden was awarded Scientific American&#x27;s Safety at Sea Gold Medal, in recognition of his invention &quot;of the Fathometer and other safety instruments for safety at sea&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
After settling his lawsuit with RCA, Fessenden purchased a small estate called &quot;Wistowe&quot; (previously the home of Charles Maxwell Allen, the United States Consul, who had hosted Samuel Clemens there), in Hamilton Parish, near to Flatts Village in Bermuda. He died there on July 22, 1932, and was interred in the cemetery of St. Mark&#x27;s Church, Bermuda. On the occasion of his death, an editorial in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;Fessenden Against the World&quot;, said:
It sometimes happens, even in science, that one man can be right against the world. Professor Fessenden was that man. It is ironic that among the hundreds of thousands of young radio engineers whose commonplaces of theory rest on what Professor Fessenden fought for bitterly and alone only a handful realize that the battle ever happened... It was he who insisted, against the stormy protests of every recognized authority, that what we now call radio was worked by &quot;continuous waves&quot; of the kind discovered by Hertz, sent through the ether by the transmitting station as light waves are sent out by a flame. Marconi and others insisted, instead, that what was happening was the so-called &quot;whiplash effect&quot;... It is probably not too much to say that the progress of radio was retarded a decade by this error... The whiplash theory faded gradually out of men&#x27;s minds and was replaced by the continuous wave one with all too little credit to the man who had been right...

Beginning in 1961, the Society of Exploration Geophysicists has annually awarded its Reginald Fessenden Award to &quot;a person who has made a specific technical contribution to exploration geophysics&quot;. In 1980, a Fessenden-Trott Scholarship was established at Purdue University&#x27;s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, in memory of Reginald Fessenden and his wife.

===Reginald A. Fessenden House===
Fessenden&#x27;s home at 45 Waban Hill Road in the village of Chestnut Hill in Newton, Massachusetts, is on the National Register of Historic Places and is also a U.S. National Historic Landmark. He bought the house in 1906 or earlier and owned it for the rest of his life.

<text>Blow is a 2001 American biographical crime drama film directed by Ted Demme, about an American cocaine kingpin and his international network. David McKenna and Nick Cassavetes adapted Bruce Porter&#x27;s 1993 book &quot;Blow: How a Small Town Boy Made $100 Million with the Medellín Cocaine Cartel and Lost It All&quot; for the screenplay. It is based on the real-life stories of U.S. drug trafficker George Jung (played by Johnny Depp) and his connections including narcotics kings Pablo Escobar and Carlos Lehder Rivas (portrayed in the film as Diego Delgado), and the Medellín Cartel.

==Plot==
George Jung and his parents Fred and Ermine live in Weymouth, Massachusetts. When George is 10 years old, Fred files for bankruptcy but tries to make George realize that money is not important.

In the late 1960s, an adult George moves to Los Angeles with his friend &quot;Tuna&quot;; they meet Barbara, a flight attendant, who introduces them to Derek Foreal, a marijuana dealer. With Derek&#x27;s help, George and Tuna make a lot of money. Kevin Dulli, a visiting college student from Boston, tells them of the demand for marijuana back home. They start selling marijuana there, buying marijuana directly from Mexico with the help of Santiago Sanchez, a Mexican drug lord. Two years later, George is caught in Chicago trying to import of marijuana and is sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment. After unsuccessfully trying to plead his innocence, George skips bail to take care of Barbara, who dies from cancer. Her death marks the disbanding of the group of friends.

While hiding from the authorities, George visits his parents. George&#x27;s mother calls the police, who arrest him. He is sentenced to 26 months in a federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut. His cellmate Diego Delgado has contacts in the Medellin cartel and convinces George to help him go into the cocaine business. Upon his release from prison, George violates his parole conditions and heads down to Cartagena, Colombia to meet with Diego. They meet with cartel officer Cesar Rosa to negotiate the terms for smuggling to establish &quot;good faith&quot;.

As the smuggling operation grows, Diego is arrested, leaving George to find a way to sell . George reconnects with Derek in California, and the two sell all the cocaine. George then goes to Medellín, Colombia and meets Pablo Escobar, who agrees to go into business with them. With the help of Derek, the pair becomes Escobar&#x27;s top U.S. importer. At Diego&#x27;s wedding, George meets Cesar&#x27;s fiancée Mirtha and later marries her. However, Diego resents George for keeping Derek&#x27;s identity secret and pressures George to reveal his connection. George eventually discovers that Diego has betrayed him by cutting him out of the connection with Derek. Inspired by the birth of his daughter and a drug-related heart attack, George severs his relationship with the cartel.

All goes well with George&#x27;s newfound civilian life for five years, until Mirtha organizes a 38th birthday party for him. Many of his former drug associates attend, including Derek, who reveals that Diego eventually cut him out as well. The FBI and DEA raid the party and arrest George. He becomes a fugitive, and his bank account—heretofore under Manuel Noriega&#x27;s protection in Panama—is seized by Noriega. One night, he and Mirtha get into a fight while driving. They are pulled over by police and Mirtha tells them George is a fugitive and has stashed a kilogram of cocaine in his trunk. He is sent to jail for three years, Mirtha divorces him and takes custody of their nine-year-old daughter, Kristina Sunshine Jung.

Upon his release, George struggles to maintain his relationship with his daughter. He promises Kristina a vacation in California and seeks one last deal to garner enough money for the trip. George completes a deal with former accomplices but learns too late that the deal had been set up by the FBI and DEA, with Dulli and Derek having leaked the nature and location of the action in exchange for pardons for their involvement in his prior action. George is sentenced to 60 years at Otisville Correctional Facility in upstate New York. He explains in the end that neither the sentence nor the betrayal bothered him, but that he can never forgive himself for having to break a promise to his daughter.

While in prison, George requests a furlough to see his dying father, Fred. His mother denies the request. George records a final message to Fred, recounting his memories of working with his father, his run-ins with the law, and finally, too late, his understanding of what Fred meant when he said that money is not &quot;real&quot;. An old man in prison, George imagines that his daughter finally comes to visit him. She slowly fades away as a guard calls for George. The film concludes with notes indicating that Jung will not be eligible for parole until 2015 and that his daughter has yet to visit him.

==Soundtrack==
&quot;Blow&quot;″s soundtrack is a compilation of songs and artists from the 1950s to the 1970s. Graeme Revell also composed the original score for the film.

===Track listing===

Tracklist adapted from Discogs.
==Release==
&quot;Blow&quot; was released to North American theaters on April 6, 2001. To promote the film, pocket-size rectangular mirrors were distributed at advance screenings. The promotional items attracted criticism for appearing to promote cocaine use, as the mirrors resembled ones used to cut cocaine.

&quot;Blow&quot; performed below expectations at the box office. With a budget of roughly $53 million, it managed to earn just under $53 million domestically but raised just over $30 million internationally for a worldwide total of $83,282,296.

==Reception==
The film holds an approval rating of 55% at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 141 reviews, with a weighted average score of 5.8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus is: &quot;With elements that seem borrowed from movies like &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, &quot;Blow&quot; is pretty much been-there-done-that despite another excellent performance from Johnny Depp. It, also, becomes too sentimental at the end.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Rob Gonsalves from &quot;eFilmCritic.com&quot; gave the film four out of five stars stating: &quot;&quot;Blow&quot; isn&#x27;t really a classic, but it&#x27;s a sobering story well-told.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half out of four stars; he questioned the value of making Jung the subject of this film, stating: &quot;That&#x27;s the thing about George [Jung]. He thinks it&#x27;s all about him. His life, his story, his success, his fortune, his lost fortune, his good luck, his bad luck. Actually, all he did was operate a toll gate between suppliers and addicts. You wonder, but you never find out, if the reality of those destroyed lives ever occurred to him.&quot; David Nusair of &quot;Reel Films&quot; also questioned making a film about Jung, stating &quot;The biggest problem with &quot;Blow&quot; is that Jung is such a complete moron.&quot; Nusair concludes that while it &quot;is not a bad film ... the central character of George Jung just doesn&#x27;t seem worthy to be the center of attention.&quot;

Christopher Smith from &quot;Bangor Daily News&quot; gave the film a &quot;D+&quot;, stating &quot;&quot;Blow&quot; is ultimately more about charisma than it is about truth, more about Depp&#x27;s smooth strut and tousled hair than it is about George Jung&#x27;s fatal flaws—his stupidity, desperation, ego and small-town greed.&quot;

Penélope Cruz was nominated for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress for her performances in &quot;Blow&quot; as well as &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot; and &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;.

<text>Laura Serrano Garcia (born October 20, 1967, in Mexico City) is a Mexican boxer.

Serrano began boxing at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México in Mexico City, where she was studying to become a lawyer. She wanted to lose weight and stay in shape. She applied for a professional boxer&#x27;s license in Mexico. After a short appearance in two episodes of the &quot;Volver a empezar&quot; soap opera, she went to Las Vegas, and on a pay per view card she challenged Christy Martin for the world title. It was her first fight as a professional and resulted in a draw.

Serrano&#x27;s next fight was against world champion Deirdre Gogarty. She won by a knockout in seven rounds, in what was the first all women&#x27;s boxing undercard held at the Aladdin Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas.

Serrano was supposed to box on the Julio César Chávez-Miguel Ángel González Pay Per View event&#x27;s undercard in Mexico City. However, a ban from 1947 was found, forbidding women from boxing events in Mexico City. Thanks in part to Serrano&#x27;s subsequent legal battle, the ordinance was dropped.

Serrano suffered a foot injury for which she underwent surgery, but in 1999 she came back and won a decision in her comeback bout. She then, on 2 September 1999, [details from her BoxRec page] met and defeated the world champion Tracy Byrd to become Mexico&#x27;s first woman world boxing champion.

She defended her title against Cinthya Prouder (won in a unanimous decision after round 6), Alicia Ashley (won in a unanimous decision after round 8), Gina Greenwald (knockout in round 1) and Kelsey Jeffries (knockout in round 3), followed. The Jeffries fight resulted in Jeffries&#x27; first defeat.

On August 12, 2008, Serrano challenged Melissa Del Valle for the Junior Lightweight title. Once again, this world title attempt resulted in a draw (tie).

Serrano has won her last two world title defenses, both decisions, one in ten rounds in Las Vegas and another one, a six-round win in Phoenix.

== Personal ==
As of 2005, she was engaged to be married. Serrano is also a lawyer.

During 2015, she was inducted as the first Mexican female boxer in the International Women&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame.

He played one of the most prominent roles in computer music during the 16-bit microcomputer era, composing hundreds of tunes for games and demos. He was also an experienced Amiga programmer and ported many of Thalion Software&#x27;s Atari ST titles. He no longer composes music for a living and in 2006 he was working in logistics.

Jochen&#x27;s first computer music was a set of Christmas songs that he arranged in a rock style on his school&#x27;s Commodore 64.

As a member of The Exceptions under the handle Mad Max, he wrote most of the music for their demos including the B.I.G. Demo (Best in Galaxy). The demo was essentially a large collection of C64 tunes that was ported across to the Atari ST&#x27;s Yamaha YM2149 sound chip using Jochen&#x27;s own driver to get the most out of it. Jochen then had to fix all the music in order to get it to sound correct on the ST as the YM2149 has no resonance filter, no Oscillator sync, no combined waveforms, no ASDR enveloping and no ring modulation, and it has fewer waveforms than the MOS Technology 6581. Composers (such as Rob Hubbard) used a lot of special effects in their music which was difficult to replicate on the ST&#x27;s sound chip.

Another note of interest is that the B.I.G. demo contained an additional demo screen entitled &quot;The Digital Department&quot; containing 6 digital versions of C64 tunes. The sound routine used each channel of the YM2149 as a 4-bit DAC and played samples for each instrument. This is the first time music using PCM sample instruments is heard on the Atari ST, unfortunately only one more piece of music is ever written using this routine, albeit the 16-minute-long Knuckle Busters tune by Rob Hubbard. This appears as a guest screen in the Cuddly Demos (written by The Carebears) and was used to torment Richard Karsmakers of ST News who was promptly chained to a chair as the disk was formatted before his very eyes!

He worked as a freelance musician, doing music for many 16-bit games. He eventually joined Thalion Software as a programmer and musician. His musical track for the game &quot;Amberstar&quot; is considered among his best works, and the game and Hippel&#x27;s music acquired a cult following. For in game music on the Amiga Jochen often stuck to chiptune-like sound – that became his trademark – instead of using more &quot;realistic&quot; instrument sounds that machine&#x27;s support for digitized sound made possible. Title music for &quot;Wings of Death&quot; and &quot;Lethal Xcess&quot; are exceptions.

He has released an album called &quot;Give it a Try&quot; and has composed music for other albums including tracks on &quot;Immortal 2&quot; and &quot;Immortal 3&quot; Amiga Immortal.

Hippel was also a programmer, he created all of his own music tools and also ported most of Thalion&#x27;s early Atari ST titles to the Amiga. Hippel also created the Amiga 7 voice replay routine which was used in several Thalion and Eclipse titles and later used by Chris Hülsbeck in his TFMX replay routine for the title music of &quot;Turrican 2&quot; and &quot;Turrican 3&quot; for which he wrote the in game loading music.

==Video game music==
Most songs which are for Atari ST only are conversions while works for both machines are usually Hippel&#x27;s own compositions.

<doc id="96904" wikidata="Q296069" url="?curid=96904" title="Alex Haley">
<text>Alexander Murray Palmer Haley (August 11, 1921 – February 10, 1992) was an American writer and the author of the 1976 book &quot;.&quot; ABC adapted the book as a television miniseries of the same name and aired it in 1977 to a record-breaking audience of 130 million viewers. In the United States, the book and miniseries raised the public awareness of black American history and inspired a broad interest in genealogy and family history.

Haley&#x27;s first book was &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot;, published in 1965, a collaboration through numerous lengthy interviews with Malcolm X.

He was working on a second family history novel at his death. Haley had requested that David Stevens, a screenwriter, complete it; the book was published as &quot;.&quot; It was adapted as a miniseries, &quot;Alex Haley&#x27;s Queen&quot;, broadcast in 1993.

==Early life and education==

Alex Haley was born in Ithaca, New York, on August 11, 1921, and was the eldest of three brothers (the other two being George and Julius) and a half-sister (from his father&#x27;s second marriage). Haley lived with his family in Henning, Tennessee, before returning to Ithaca with his family when he was five years old. Haley&#x27;s father was Simon Haley, a professor of agriculture at Alabama A&amp;M University, and his mother was Bertha George Haley (née Palmer), who had grown up in Henning. The family had Mandinka, other African, Cherokee, Scottish, and Scottish-Irish roots. The younger Haley always spoke proudly of his father and the obstacles of racism he had overcome.

Like his father, Alex Haley was enrolled at Alcorn State University, a historically black college in Mississippi and, a year later, enrolled at Elizabeth City State College, also historically black, in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. The following year, he withdrew from college. His father felt that Alex needed discipline and growth, and convinced him to enlist in the military. On May 24, 1939, Alex Haley began what was to become a 20-year career in the United States Coast Guard.

Haley traced back his maternal ancestry, through genealogical research, to Jufureh, in The Gambia.

==Coast Guard career==

Haley enlisted as a mess attendant. Later he was promoted to the rate of petty officer third-class in the rating of steward, one of the few ratings open to black personnel at that time. It was during his service in the Pacific theater of operations that Haley taught himself the craft of writing stories. During his enlistment other sailors often paid him to write love letters to their girlfriends. He said that the greatest enemy he and his crew faced during their long voyages was not the Japanese forces but rather boredom.

After World War II, Haley petitioned the U.S. Coast Guard to allow him to transfer into the field of journalism. By 1949 he had become a petty officer first-class in the rating of a journalist. He later advanced to chief petty officer and held this rank until his retirement from the Coast Guard in 1959. He was the first chief journalist in the Coast Guard, the rating having been expressly created for him in recognition of his literary ability.

Haley&#x27;s awards and decorations from the Coast Guard include the Coast Guard Good Conduct Medal (6 awards represented by 1 silver and 1 bronze service star), American Defense Service Medal (with &quot;Sea&quot; clasp), American Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, Korean Service Medal, National Defense Service Medal, United Nations Service Medal, and the Coast Guard Expert Marksmanship Medal. The Republic of Korea awarded him the War Service Medal, ten years after he died. The United States Coast Guard dedicated the cutter formerly known as USS &quot;Edenton&quot; to Haley by recommissioning it as in July 1999. The cutter currently serves from Kodiak, Alaska.

==Literary career==
After retiring from the U.S. Coast Guard, Haley began another phase of his career in journalism. He eventually became a senior editor for &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; magazine. Haley wrote an article for the magazine about his brother George&#x27;s struggles to succeed as one of the first black students at a Southern law school.

===&quot;Playboy&quot; magazine===
Haley conducted the first interview for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. Haley elicited candid comments from jazz musician Miles Davis about his thoughts and feelings on racism in an interview he had started, but not finished, for &quot;Show Business Illustrated&quot;, another magazine created by &quot;Playboy&quot; founder Hugh Hefner that folded in early 1962. Haley completed the interview and it appeared in &quot;Playboy&quot;&#x27;s September 1962 issue. That interview set the tone for what became a significant feature of the magazine. Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Playboy&quot; Interview with Haley was the longest he ever granted to any publication.

Throughout the 1960s, Haley was responsible for some of the magazine&#x27;s most notable interviews, including one with George Lincoln Rockwell, leader of the American Nazi Party. He agreed to meet with Haley only after gaining assurance from the writer that he was not Jewish. Haley remained professional during the interview, although Rockwell kept a handgun on the table throughout it. (The interview was recreated in &quot;&quot;, with James Earl Jones as Haley and Marlon Brando as Rockwell.) Haley also interviewed Muhammad Ali, who spoke about changing his name from Cassius Clay. Other interviews include Jack Ruby&#x27;s defense attorney Melvin Belli, entertainer Sammy Davis Jr., football player Jim Brown, TV host Johnny Carson, and music producer Quincy Jones.

===&quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot;===

&quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot;, published in 1965, was Haley&#x27;s first book. It describes the trajectory of Malcolm X&#x27;s life from street criminal to national spokesman for the Nation of Islam to his conversion to Sunni Islam. It also outlines Malcolm X&#x27;s philosophy of black pride, black nationalism, and pan-Africanism. Haley wrote an epilogue to the book summarizing the end of Malcolm X&#x27;s life, including his assassination in New York&#x27;s Audubon Ballroom.

Haley ghostwrote &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot; based on more than 50 in-depth interviews he conducted with Malcolm X between 1963 and Malcolm X&#x27;s February 1965 assassination. The two men had first met in 1960 when Haley wrote an article about the Nation of Islam for &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. They met again when Haley interviewed Malcolm X for &quot;Playboy&quot;.

The initial interviews for the autobiography frustrated Haley. Rather than discussing his own life, Malcolm X spoke about Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the Nation of Islam; he became angry about Haley&#x27;s reminders that the book was supposed to be about Malcolm X. After several meetings, Haley asked Malcolm X to tell him something about his mother. That question drew Malcolm X into recounting his life story.

&quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot; has been a consistent best-seller since its 1965 publication. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that six million copies of the book had sold by 1977. In 1998, &quot;Time&quot; magazine ranked &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot; as one of the 10 most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century.

In 1966, Haley received the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot;.

===&quot;Super Fly T.N.T.&quot;===
In 1973, Haley wrote his only screenplay, &quot;Super Fly T.N.T.&quot; The film starred and was directed by Ron O&#x27;Neal.

===&quot;Roots&quot;===

In 1976, Haley published &quot;&quot;, a novel based on his family&#x27;s history, going back to slavery days. It started with the story of Kunta Kinte, who was kidnapped in The Gambia in 1767 and transported to the Province of Maryland to be sold as a slave. Haley claimed to be a seventh-generation descendant of Kunta Kinte, and his work on the novel involved twelve years of research, intercontinental travel, and writing. He went to the village of Juffure, where Kunta Kinte grew up and listened to a tribal historian (griot) tell the story of Kinte&#x27;s capture. Haley also traced the records of the ship, &quot;The Lord Ligonier&quot;, which he said carried his ancestor to the Americas.

Haley stated that the most emotional moment of his life occurred on September 29, 1967, when he stood at the site in Annapolis, Maryland, where his ancestor had arrived from Africa in chains exactly 200 years before. A memorial depicting Haley reading a story to young children gathered at his feet has since been erected in the center of Annapolis.

&quot;Roots&quot; was eventually published in 37 languages. Haley won a special Pulitzer Prize for the work in 1977. The same year, &quot;Roots&quot; was adapted as a popular television miniseries of the same name by ABC. The serial reached a record-breaking 130 million viewers. &quot;Roots&quot; emphasized that black Americans have a long history and that not all of that history is necessarily lost, as many believed. Its popularity also sparked a greatly increased public interest in genealogy.

In 1979, ABC aired the sequel miniseries, &quot;&quot;, which continued the story of Kunta Kinte&#x27;s descendants. It concluded with Haley&#x27;s travel to Juffure. Haley was portrayed at different ages by Kristoff St. John, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; actor Damon Evans, and Tony Award winner James Earl Jones. In 2016, History aired a remake of the original miniseries. Haley appeared briefly, portrayed by Tony Award winner Laurence Fishburne.

Haley was briefly a &quot;writer in residence&quot; at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, where he began writing &quot;Roots&quot;. He enjoyed spending time at a local bistro called the Savoy in nearby Rome, where he would sometimes pass the time listening to the piano player. Today, there is a special table in honor of Haley at the Savoy, and a painting of Haley writing &quot;Roots&quot; on a yellow legal tablet.

===Plagiarism lawsuits and other criticism===


&quot;Roots&quot; faced two lawsuits that charged plagiarism and copyright infringement. The lawsuit brought by Margaret Walker was dismissed, but Harold Courlander&#x27;s suit was successful. Courlander&#x27;s novel &quot;The African&quot; describes an African boy who is captured by slave traders, follows him across the Atlantic on a slave ship, and describes his attempts to hold on to his African traditions on a plantation in America. Haley admitted that some passages from &quot;The African&quot; had made it into &quot;Roots&quot;, settling the case out of court in 1978 and paying Courlander $650,000 (). In his biography of Haley, the academic Robert J. Norrell uses court transcripts and eyewitness testimony to show the judge in this trial, Nixon-appointee Robert Ward, not only lacked experience but was hostile to the defendant. According to an anonymous source, Judge Ward made it clear he thought Haley incapable of writing &quot;Roots&quot; at all.

Genealogists have also disputed Haley&#x27;s research and conclusions in &quot;Roots&quot;. The Gambian &quot;griot&quot; turned out not to be a real &quot;griot&quot;, and the story of Kunta Kinte appears to have been a case of circular reporting, in which Haley&#x27;s own words were repeated back to him. None of the written records in Virginia and North Carolina line up with the &quot;Roots&quot; story until after the Civil War. Some elements of Haley&#x27;s family story can be found in the written records, but the most likely genealogy would be different from the one described in &quot;Roots&quot;.

Haley and his work have been excluded from the &quot;Norton Anthology of African-American Literature&quot;, despite his status as the United States&#x27; best-selling black author. Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., one of the anthology&#x27;s general editors, has denied that the controversies surrounding Haley&#x27;s works are the reason for this exclusion. In 1998, Gates acknowledged the doubts surrounding Haley&#x27;s claims about &quot;Roots&quot;, saying, &quot;Most of us feel it&#x27;s highly unlikely that Alex actually found the village whence his ancestors sprang. &quot;Roots&quot; is a work of the imagination rather than strict historical scholarship.&quot;

In 2023, Jonathan Eig suggested that Haley had made a number of fabrications in his 1965 &quot;Playboy&quot; interview with Martin Luther King Jr., including embellishing his criticisms of Malcolm X.

==Later life and death==

Early in the 1980s, Haley worked with the Walt Disney Company to develop an Equatorial Africa pavilion for its Epcot Center theme park. Haley appeared on a CBS broadcast of Epcot Center&#x27;s opening day celebration, discussing the plans and exhibiting concept art with host Danny Kaye. Ultimately, the pavilion was not built due to political and financial issues.

Late in the 1970s, Haley had begun working on a second historical novel based on another branch of his family, traced through his grandmother Queen; she was the daughter of a black slave woman and her white master.

He did not finish the novel before dying in Seattle, Washington, of a heart attack on February 10, 1992. He was buried beside his childhood home in Henning, Tennessee.

At his request, the novel was finished by David Stevens and was published as &quot;&quot; in 1993. Earlier the same year, it was adapted as a miniseries of the same name.

Late in Haley&#x27;s life he had acquired a small farm in Clinton, Tennessee, although at the time it had a Norris, Tennessee address. The farm is a few miles from the Museum of Appalachia, and Haley lived there until his death. After he died, the property was sold to the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund (CDF), which calls it the Alex Haley Farm. The nonprofit organization uses the farm as a national training center and retreat site. An abandoned barn on the farm property was rebuilt as a traditional cantilevered barn, using a design by architect Maya Lin. The building now serves as a library for the CDF.

===Collection of Alex Haley&#x27;s personal works===
The University of Tennessee Libraries Special Collections maintains a collection of Alex Haley&#x27;s personal papers. The works contain notes, outlines, bibliographies, research, and legal papers documenting Haley&#x27;s &quot;Roots&quot; through 1977. Of particular interest are the items showing Harold Courlander&#x27;s lawsuit against Haley, Doubleday &amp; Company, and various affiliated groups.
Portions of Alex Haley&#x27;s personal collection is also located at the African-American Research Library and Cultural Center at the Special Collections and Archives in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The Keeper of the Word Foundation in Detroit, Michigan maintains Alex Haley&#x27;s Coast Guard notes, writings, and love letter notes that developed Haley&#x27;s writings. Along with the digital unpublished &quot;Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot; and &quot;Epilogue&quot;, omitted introduction and chapters, outline, letters, handwritten notes, Haley&#x27;s complete interviews of Malcolm X&#x27;s, poetry and edited notes, and digital rights.

===Kunta Kinte-Alex Haley Memorial===
In the city dock section of Annapolis, Maryland, there is a memorial to mark the arrival location of Kunta Kinte in 1767. The monument, dedicated on June 12, 2002, also celebrates the preservation of African-American heritage and family history.

===Alex Haley Birthplace Memorial &amp; Historical Marker===
In May 1993, the Alex Haley Memorial Project in Ithaca, New York created a memorial pocket park at Alex Haley&#x27;s birthplace in town, 212 Cascadilla Street; the park contains a carved granite marker and a hand-wrought iron bench with individual iron leaves made by community members. Funded by the Legacy Foundation of Tompkins County, the Alex Haley Memorial Project members also acquired a New York Historical Marker for the site, placed outside the 212 Cascadilla Street home in August 2020. Located nearby at 408 North Albany Street is the Alex Haley Municipal Pool, which also opened in 1993, immediately across the street from the Greater Ithaca Activities Center (GIAC), one of the area&#x27;s prominent community centers.

<text>Box Tunnel passes through Box Hill on the Great Western Main Line (GWML) between Bath and Chippenham. The tunnel was the world&#x27;s longest railway tunnel when it was completed in 1841.

Built between December 1838 and June 1841 for the Great Western Railway (GWR) under the direction of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the straight tunnel descends on a 1 in 100 gradient from its eastern end. At the time the tunnel&#x27;s construction was considered dangerous due to its length and the composition of the underlying strata. The west portal is Grade II* listed and the east portal is Grade II listed.

Ammunition was stored near the tunnel during World War II, reusing mine workings. During the 2010s, the tunnel was modified and the track lowered to prepare it for electrification, although in 2016, this plan has been suspended for the time being.

==History==
===Background===
During the 1830s, Isambard Kingdom Brunel developed a plan for a railway running east–west between London and Bristol. The Great Western Main Line would maintain either level ground or gentle gradients of no greater than 1 in 1000 along most of its route. Between Swindon and Bath, at the highest point of the line, a tunnel was proposed through Box Hill, outside Corsham.

The tunnel would have a gradient of 1 in 100. At the time, the use of such a steep gradient inside the tunnel allegedly provoked criticism by some of Brunel&#x27;s contemporaries. Box Tunnel would be the longest railway tunnel at almost in length.

===Geology===
While a tunnel had been included in the 1835 Great Western Railway Act, contemporary engineers considered the construction of Box Tunnel to be an impossibility at worst and a dangerous undertaking at best. The challenge posed was not only its length but the difficult underlying strata it would have to pass through. The rocks through which it passes comprise Great Oolite overlying fuller&#x27;s earth, and Inferior Oolite and Bridport Sand beneath, a combination with which tunnellers were familiar.

The Great Oolite limestone, known as &quot;Bath Stone&quot;, is easily worked and had been used for construction since Roman times. In the 17th and 18th centuries it was extracted by the room and pillar method and used for many buildings in Bath, Somerset.
To assess the geology more accurately, between 1836 and 1837, Brunel sank eight shafts at intervals along the tunnel&#x27;s projected alignment.

===Construction===
The GWR selected George Burge of Herne Bay as the major contractor, being responsible for undertaking 75 per cent of overall tunnel length, working from the western end. Burge appointed Samuel Yockney as his engineer and manager. Locally based Lewis and Brewer were responsible for the remainder, starting from the eastern side. One of Brunel&#x27;s personal assistants, William Glennie, was in overall charge until completion.
In December 1838, construction started. Work was divided into six sections; access to each was via a ventilation shaft, which ranged in depth from at the eastern end to towards the western end. The men, equipment, materials and of extract had to go in and come out of the shafts assisted by steam-powered winches. The shafts were the safety exits from the tunnel.

Candles provided the only lighting in the workings and were consumed at a rate of one tonne per week, which was equalled by the weekly consumption of explosives. Due to the considerable time required for men to enter and exit the workings, blasting took place while they were in the tunnel. This practice and water ingress exceeding the calculated volumes, has been attributed as causing most of the deaths that occurred. About 100 navvies were killed during the tunnel&#x27;s construction. Additional pumping and drainage were required during and after its construction. Large amounts of water entering the tunnel in the winter months impeded progress.

Once the eastern section had been blasted out, it was cut to form a gothic arch and left unlined. The western section was excavated using picks and shovels and the walls were lined with brick. Over 30 million bricks were used which were manufactured in nearby Chippenham and transported in horse-drawn carts. Horses were used to remove much of the spoil.

The restrictions imposed by the site contributed to a delay in the tunnel&#x27;s completion. By August 1839, only 40 per cent of the works had been finished. By summer 1840, the to section of the Great Western Main Line (GWML) had been completed, as was the track from Bath to . The Box Tunnel was the last section of the GWML to be finished, although not for lack of effort on the part of Brunel.

During January 1841 Brunel came to an agreement with Burge and Yockney to increase their workforce from to , and the tunnel was completed in April 1841. The completed tunnel was wide and capable of accommodating a pair of broad-gauge tracks. When the ends of the tunnel were joined, there was less than of error in their alignment. Brunel was so delighted that he reportedly removed a ring from his finger and gave it to the works foreman.

===Opening===
On 30 June 1841, the tunnel was opened to traffic with little in the way of ceremony. A special train departed London Paddington and traversed the whole of the GWR to complete the first rail journey to Temple Meads Station in Bristol in about four hours.

After the opening, for several months, work continued to finish the tunnel&#x27;s western portal near Box, Wiltshire which Brunel had designed in a grand classical style – grander than the eastern portal as it is in full view of the London to Bath road. The height of the opening is far in excess of what was required (and indeed reduces once inside), but it gives the feel of a generous celebratory monument to a new form of travel. That height has been further accentuated with the 2015 lowering of the trackbed for electric catenary to be installed. The eastern portal at Corsham has a more modest brick face, with rusticated stone dressings.

Commentators and critics voiced concerns and disapproval about the unlined section of the tunnel; they believed that it lacked solidity and was a danger to traffic. The GWR responded to these complaints by building a brick arch underneath part of the unlined section close to the entrance which was prone to frost damage. Some areas of the tunnel remain unlined.

==Brunel&#x27;s birthday==
GWR franchise rebutted the theory that the rising sun passed through the tunnel on Isambard Brunel&#x27;s 9 April birthday, finding in 2017 that the sunrise did not shine fully through the tunnel. Librarian C.P. Atkins calculated in 1985 that full illumination through Box Tunnel would occur on 7 April in non-Leap years and on 6 April in Leap years. The Society of Genealogists in 2016 suggested the sun shone through the tunnel on 6 April, the birthday of Brunel&#x27;s sister, Emma Joan Brunel, three years out of four during the 1830s.

==Defence use==

Starting in 1844, the hill surrounding the tunnel was subject to extensive quarrying to extract Bath stone for buildings. In the run-up towards the Second World War, the need to provide secure storage for munitions at distributed locations across the UK was recognised. During the 1930s, a proposal to create three Central Ammunition Depots (CADs) was submitted: one in the north (Longtown, Cumbria); one in the Midlands (Nesscliffe, Shropshire); and one in the South of England at Tunnel quarry, Monkton Farleigh and Eastlays Ridge.
During the 1930s, Tunnel Quarry was renovated by the Royal Engineers as one of the three major stockpiles. During November 1937, the GWR was contracted to build a raised twin-loading platform at Shockerwick for Monkton Farleigh and two sidings branching from the Bristol–London mainline just outside the tunnel&#x27;s eastern entrance at . below and at right angles to this point, the War Office had built a narrow-gauge wagon-sorting yard which accessed a tunnel, built by the Cementation Company, descending at a rate of 1 in 8.5 to the Central Ammunition Depot in the former quarry workings. The logistics operation was designed to cope with a maximum of tons of ammunition per day.

A Royal Air Force station, RAF Box, was established and used an area of the tunnels. In response to the Bristol Blitz, during 1940, Alfred McAlpine developed a fallback aircraft engine factory for use by the Bristol Aeroplane Company (BAC), although it never went into production. BAC used the facility to accommodate the company&#x27;s experimental department, which was developing an engine to power bombers and the Bristol Beaufighter.

The CAD was closed at the end of the war but was maintained in operational condition until the 1950s. The sidings were cleared, and saw no further use until the mid-1980s when a museum was opened on the site for a short period. During the post-war years, portions of the ammunition depot were redeveloped for other facilities, including the Central Government War Headquarters, RAF No.1 Signal Unit, Controller Defence Communication Network and the Corsham Computer Centre.

As of the present day, the only element of the complex that remains is the former computer centre. The visible north end of the tunnel has been sealed by concrete and rubble. The former CAD has been reused as a secure commercial document storage facility.

==Electrification==
The tunnel was planned to be electrified by 2017 as part of the Great Western Electrification Programme. During the summer of 2015, the tunnel was closed for six weeks for preparatory work including lowering the track by roughly and replacing of cabling in advance of the catenary infrastructure being installed. However a November 2016 announcement stated that the plan to electrify the mainline from Thingley Junction (near Chippenham) to Bristol Temple Meads was delayed indefinitely.

<doc id="96908" wikidata="Q3133007" url="?curid=96908" title="Title IX">
<text>Title IX is a landmark federal civil rights law in the United States that was enacted as part (Title IX) of the Education Amendments of 1972. It prohibits sex-based discrimination in any school or any other education program that receives funding from the federal government. This is Public Law No. 92‑318, 86 Stat. 235 (June 23, 1972), codified at 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681–1688.

Senator Birch Bayh wrote the 37 opening words of Title IX. Bayh first introduced an amendment to the Higher Education Act to ban discrimination on the basis of sex on August 6, 1971, and again on February 28, 1972, when it passed the Senate. Representative Edith Green, chair of the Subcommittee on Education, had held hearings on discrimination against women, and introduced legislation in the House on May 11, 1972. The full Congress passed Title IX on June 8, 1972. Representative Patsy Mink emerged in the House to lead efforts to protect Title IX against attempts to weaken it, and it was later renamed the Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act following Mink&#x27;s death in 2002. When Title IX was passed in 1972, 42 percent of the students enrolled in American colleges were female.

The purpose of Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 was to update Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned several forms of discrimination in employment, but did not address or mention discrimination in education.

==Text==
The following is the opening of the text of Title IX, which is followed by several exceptions and clarifications:

==Historical background==

===Foundations and hearings===
Title IX was enacted as a follow-up to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The 1964 Act was passed to end discrimination in various fields based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in the areas of employment and public accommodation. The 1964 Act did not prohibit sex discrimination against people employed at educational institutions. A parallel law, Title VI, had also been enacted in 1964 to prohibit discrimination in federally funded private and public entities. It covered race, color, and national origin but excluded sex. Feminists during the early 1970s lobbied Congress to add sex as a protected class category. Title IX was enacted to fill this gap and prohibit discrimination in all federally funded education programs. Congressman John Tower then proposed an amendment to Title IX that would have exempted &quot;revenue-generating&quot; sports from Title IX.

The Tower Amendment was rejected, but it led to widespread misunderstanding of Title IX as a sports-equity law, rather than an anti-discrimination, civil rights law. While Title IX is best known for its impact on high school and collegiate athletics, the original statute made no explicit mention of sports. The United States Supreme Court also issued decisions in the 1980s and 1990s, making clear that sexual harassment and assault is a form of sex discrimination. In 2011, President Barack Obama issued guidance reminding schools of their obligation to redress sexual assaults as civil rights matters under Title IX. Obama also issued guidance clarifying Title IX protections for LGBT students through Dear Colleague letters.

The precursor to Title IX was an executive order, issued in 1967 by President Lyndon Johnson, forbidding discrimination in federal contracts. Before these orders were issued, the National Organization for Women (NOW) had persuaded him to include the addition of women. Executive Order 11375 required all entities receiving federal contracts to end discrimination on the basis of sex in hiring and employment. In 1969, a notable example of its success was Bernice Sandler, who used the executive order to retain her job and tenure at the University of Maryland. She used university statistics to show how female employment at the university had plummeted as qualified women were replaced by men. Sandler then brought her complaints to the Department of Labor&#x27;s Office for Federal Fair Contracts Compliance, where she was encouraged to file a formal complaint; later citing inequalities in pay, rank, and admissions, among others.

Sandler soon began to file complaints against the University of Maryland and other colleges while working with NOW and the Women&#x27;s Equity Action League (WEAL). Sandler later filed 269 complaints against colleges and universities, which led to the events of 1970. In 1970, Sandler joined U.S. House Representative Edith Green&#x27;s Subcommittee on Higher Education of the Education and Labor Committee, and observed corresponding congressional hearings relating to women&#x27;s issues on employment and equal opportunity. In these hearings, Green and Sandler initially proposed the idea of Title IX. An early legislative draft aimed at amending the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was then authored by Representative Green. At the hearing, there were mentions of athletics. The idea behind the draft was a progressive one in instituting an affirmative action for women in all aspects of American education.

===Steps from a draft to legislative act to public law===

Title IX was formally introduced in Congress by Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana in 1971, who then was its chief Senate sponsor for congressional debate. At the time, Bayh was working on numerous constitutional issues related to women&#x27;s employment and sex discrimination—including, but not limited to, the revised draft of the Equal Rights Amendment. The ERA attempted to build &quot;a powerful constitutional base from which to move forward in abolishing discriminatory differential treatment based on sex&quot;. As Bayh was having partisan difficulty in later getting the ERA Amendment out of committee, the Higher Education Act of 1965 was on the Senate Floor for re-authorization; and on February 28, 1972, Bayh re-introduced a provision found in the original/revised ERA bill as an amendment which would become Title IX. In his remarks on the Senate Floor, Bayh stated, &quot;we are all familiar with the stereotype [that] women [are] pretty things who go to college to find a husband, [and who] go on to graduate school because they want a more interesting husband, and finally marry, have children, and never work again. The desire of many schools not to waste a &#x27;man&#x27;s place&#x27; on a woman stems from such stereotyped notions. But the facts contradict these myths about the &#x27;weaker sex&#x27; and it is time to change our operating assumptions.&quot; He continued: &quot;While the impact of this amendment would be far-reaching, it is not a panacea. It is, however, an important first step in the effort to provide for the women of America something that is rightfully theirs—an equal chance to attend the schools of their choice, to develop the skills they want, and to apply those skills with the knowledge that they will have a fair chance to secure the jobs of their choice with equal pay for equal work&quot;. Title IX became public law on June 23, 1972. When U.S. President Nixon signed the bill, he spoke mostly about desegregation busing, and did not mention the expansion of educational access for women he had enacted.

===Implementation===

Each institution or organization that receives federal funding must designate at least one employee as Title IX coordinator. Their duty is to oversee that Title IX is not being violated and to answer all questions pertaining to Title IX. Everyone must have access to the Title IX coordinator&#x27;s name, address, and telephone number. To ensure compliance with Title IX, programs of both male and females must display no discrimination. This applies to opportunities for athletic participation (in proportion to enrollment numbers), scholarships, and how athletes are treated (e.g., equitable locker room facilities, etc.).

Title IX&#x27;s statutory language is brief. U.S. President Nixon therefore directed the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) to publish regulations clarifying the law&#x27;s application. In 1974, U.S. Senator John Tower introduced the Tower Amendment which would have exempted revenue-producing sports from Title IX compliance. Later that year, Congress rejected the Tower Amendment and passed an amendment proposed by U.S. Senator Jacob Javits directing HEW to include &quot;reasonable provisions considering the nature of particular sports&quot; adopted in its place. In June 1975, HEW published the final regulations detailing how Title IX would be enforced. These regulations were codified in the Federal Register in the Code of Federal Regulations Volume 34, Part 106 (). Since 1975, the federal government has issued guidance clarifying how it interprets and enforces those regulations.

===Further legislation===

The Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1988 is tied to Title IX which was passed in response to the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s 1984 ruling &quot;Grove City College v. Bell.&quot; The Court held that Title IX applied only to those programs receiving direct federal aid. This case was initially reached by the Supreme Court when Grove City College disagreed with the Department of Education&#x27;s assertion that it was required to comply with Title IX. Grove City College was not a federally funded institution; however, they did accept students who were receiving Basic Educational Opportunity Grants through a Department of Education program. The Department of Education&#x27;s stance was that because some of its students were receiving federal grants, the school was thus receiving federal assistance and Title  IX applied to it. The Court decided that since Grove City College was only receiving federal funding through the grant program that only this program had to comply. This ruling was a major victory for those opposed to Title IX as it then made many athletic programs outside the purview of Title IX, and thus reduced its scope.

Grove City&#x27;s court victory, however, was short-lived. The Civil Rights Restoration Act passed in 1988, which extended Title IX coverage to all programs of any educational institution that receives &quot;any&quot; federal assistance, both direct and indirect. In 1994, the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act, sponsored by Congresswoman Cardiss Collins required that federally-assisted educational institutions disclose information on roster sizes for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s athletic teams; as well as budgets for recruiting, scholarships, coaches&#x27; salaries, and other expenses, annually. In 1992, the Supreme Court decided monetary relief was available under Title IX in the case Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools. In October 2002, less than a month after the death of U.S. Rep. Patsy Mink, the U.S. Congress passed a resolution to rename Title IX the &quot;Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act&quot;, which President George W. Bush signed into law. On November 24, 2006, Title IX regulations were amended to provide greater flexibility in the operation of single-sex classes or extracurricular activities at the primary or secondary school level; this was largely to introduce federal abstinence-only programs, which may have been a partial basis for the support of President Bush.

On May 15, 2020, the Department of Education issued a letter stating that the policy of the state of Connecticut which allows transgender girls to compete in high school sports as girls was a violation of the civil rights of female student-athletes and a violation of Title IX. It stated that Connecticut&#x27;s policy &quot;denied female student-athletes athletic benefits and opportunities, including advancing to the finals in events, higher-level competitions, awards, medals, recognition, and the possibility of greater visibility to colleges and other benefits.&quot;

On March 8, 2021, President Joe Biden issued Executive Order 14021 entitled &quot;Guaranteeing an Educational Environment Free From Discrimination on the Basis of Sex, Including Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity&quot;, reversing changes made by the first Trump administration to limit the scope of Title IX to sex only, excluding gender identity and sexual orientation. The executive order also provided a timeline for the Secretary of Education and Attorney General to &quot;review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, and any other similar agency actions (collectively, agency actions) that are or may be inconsistent with the policy set forth&quot; in the order.

On June 16, 2021, the U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s Office for Civil Rights issued a Notice of Interpretation explaining that it will &quot;enforce Title IX&#x27;s prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sex to include: (1) discrimination based on sexual orientation; and (2) discrimination based on gender identity.&quot; The review set out in Executive Order 14021 is still ongoing as of April 2022.

== Impact on American schools ==

The introduction of Title IX was followed by a considerable increase in the number of female students participating in organized sports within American academic institutions followed by growing interest in initiating and developing programs which would pursue feminist principles in relationship to concerns surrounding issues dealing with girls and women&#x27;s equality and equity in sport.

===Institutional requirements===
Athletic equality requirements were later set by the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights, first in 1979 and later followed by several clarifications and amendments. To meet the requirements, schools must pass at least one of three tests measuring sex equality among athletics the school offers. These tests consist of proportional numbers of males and females participating, whether or not the school is making an effort to increase the number of the unrepresented sex, if the school has a certain history of one specific sex dominating the numbers of athletes in a given sport, and whether or not the school is showing an effort to expand the program to the other sex.

===Challenges===
There have been different interpretations regarding Title IX&#x27;s application to high school athletics. The American Sports Council sued the Department of Education in 2011 seeking a declaratory judgment that its policy interpreting Title IX&#x27;s requirement for equity in participation opportunities is limited to colleges and universities. The American Sports Council argued that &quot;The three-part test and its encouragement of quotas, has no relevance to high schools or high-school sports, and no federal regulation or interpretation has ever said that high schools must abide by the three-part test&quot;. On the other hand, the Department of Education insists that Title IX is a &quot;valuable tool&quot; for ensuring a level playing field for all students&quot; and &quot;plays a critical role in ensuring a fundamental level of fairness in America&#x27;s schools and universities&quot;.

===Coaching and administration===
Although Title IX has helped increase the participation rate of female student athletes, several challenges remain for girls and women, including for females who aspire to become involved in professional roles within sport. The growing exposure of female sports has led to an increasingly dominant representation of males in coaching positions and roles involving the governance of female athletics.

In regards to coaching roles, in spite of the fact that the legislation has helped create more and better opportunities for women, the number of women coaches has surprisingly decreased while the number of male coaches have subsequently increased. Men have also gained a larger role in directing female athletics. For example, the male-dominated National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which had been content to let the female-dominated Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) run female championships, decided to offer female championships themselves, leading to the eventual demise of the AIAW. The NCAA later tried to claim that Congress had not intended to include athletics under Title IX&#x27;s coverage, but the record lacks any sustained discussion of the matter.

===Increasing participation===

Advocates of Title IX&#x27;s current interpretation cite increases in female athletic participation, and attribute those increases to Title IX. One study, completed in 2006, pointed to a large increase in the number of women participating in athletics at both the high school and college level. The number of women in high school sports had increased by a factor of nine, while the number of women in college sports had increased by more than 450%. A 2008 study of intercollegiate athletics showed that women&#x27;s collegiate sports have grown to 9,101 teams, or 8.65 per school. The five most frequently offered college sports for women are in order: (1) Basketball, 98.8% of schools have a team; (2) Volleyball, 95.7%; (3) Soccer, 92.0%; (4) Cross Country; 90.8%, and (5) Softball; 89.2%. The lowest rank for female sports teams is bowling. The exact percentage is not known; however, there are only around 600 students on women&#x27;s bowling teams in all three divisions in the NCAA.

===Impact on men&#x27;s programs===

There have been concerns and claims that the current interpretation of Title IX by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has resulted in the dismantling of men&#x27;s programs, despite strong participation in those sports. Some believe that the increase in athletic opportunity for girls in high school has come at the expense of boys&#x27; athletics. Because teams vary widely in size, it is more common to compare the number of total participation opportunities between the sexes. Additionally, the total number of college participation opportunities has increased for both sexes in the Title IX era, though solely for women when increased enrollment is accounted for, as men&#x27;s participation has remained static relative to university enrollment, and men&#x27;s opportunities outnumber women&#x27;s by a wide margin.

Between 1981 and 1999, university athletic departments cut 171 men&#x27;s collegiate wrestling teams, 84 men&#x27;s tennis teams, 56 men&#x27;s gymnastics teams, 27 men&#x27;s track teams, and 25 men&#x27;s swimming teams. While some teams—both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s—have been eliminated in the Title IX era, both sexes have seen a net increase in the number of athletic teams over that same period. When total enrollment (which had likewise increased) is controlled for however, only women had an increase in participation.

Though interest in the sport of wrestling has consistently increased at the high school level since 1990, scores of colleges have dropped their wrestling programs during that same period. The OCR&#x27;s three-prong test for compliance with Title IX often is cited as the reason for these cuts. Wrestling historically was the most frequently dropped sport, but other men&#x27;s sports later overtook the lead. According to the NCAA, the most-dropped men&#x27;s sports between 1987 and 2002 were as follows:

#cross country (183)
#indoor track (180)
#golf (178)
#tennis (171)
#rowing (132)
#outdoor track (126)
#swimming (125)
#wrestling (121)

Additionally, eight NCAA sports—all men&#x27;s sports—were sponsored by fewer Division I schools in 2020 than in 1990, despite the D-I membership having increased by nearly 60 schools during that period.

A 2023 study found, however, that when men&#x27;s sports were cut, the funding for those sports was primarily re-directed to the men&#x27;s football and basketball programs. The study moreover suggests that it is in athletic directors&#x27; interest to not admit that the additional funding was for football and basketball, but to rather blame Title IX for the cuts.

In 2011, the American Sports Council (formerly called the College Sports Council) stated, &quot;Nationwide, there are currently 1.3 million more boys participating in high school sports than girls. Using a gender quota to enforce Title IX in high school sports would put those young athletes at risk of losing their opportunity to play.&quot; High school participation rates from the National Federation of High School associations report that in 2010–11, there were 4,494,406 boys and 3,173,549 girls participating in high school athletics.

In a 2007 study of athletic opportunities at NCAA institutions the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation reported that over 150,000 female athletic opportunities would need to be added to reach participation levels proportional to the female undergraduate population. The same study found that men&#x27;s athletics also receives the lion&#x27;s share of athletic department budgets for operating expenses, recruiting, scholarships, and coaches salaries.

===Sexual harassment and sexual violence===
Title IX applies to all educational programs and all aspects of a school&#x27;s educational system. In the late 1970s, a group of students and one faculty member sued Yale University for its failure to curtail sexual harassment on campus, especially by male faculty. This case, Alexander v. Yale, was the first to use Title IX to argue and establish that the sexual harassment of female students can be considered illegal sex discrimination. The plaintiffs in the case alleged rape, fondling, and offers of higher grades for sex by several Yale faculty. Some of the cases were based on a 1977 report authored by plaintiff Ann Olivarius, now a feminist attorney known for fighting sexual harassment, &quot;A report to the Yale Corporation from the Yale Undergraduate Women&#x27;s Caucus.&quot; Several of the plaintiffs and lawyers have written accounts of the case.

Advocates such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) likewise maintain that &quot;when students suffer sexual assault and harassment, they are deprived of equal and free access to an education.&quot; Further, according to an April 2011 letter issued by the Department of Education&#x27;s Office for Civil Rights, &quot;The sexual harassment of students, including sexual violence, interferes with students&#x27; right to receive an education free from discrimination and, in the case of sexual violence, is a crime.&quot;

The letter, referred to as the &quot;Dear Colleague Letter&quot;, states that it is the responsibility of institutions of higher education &quot;to take immediate and effective steps to end sexual harassment and sexual violence.&quot; The letter illustrates multiple examples of Title IX requirements as they relate to sexual violence and makes clear that, should an institution fail to fulfill its responsibilities under Title IX, the Department of Education can impose a fine and potentially deny further institutional access to federal funds. However, critics and later the Department of Education noted that this change was adopted without a rulemaking process to provide public notice and comment.

On March 15, 2011, Yale undergraduate student and alleged sexual violence survivor Alexandra Brodsky filed a Title IX complaint along with fifteen fellow students alleging Yale &quot;has a sexually hostile environment and has failed to adequately respond to sexual harassment concerns.&quot;

In October 2012, an Amherst College student, Angie Epifano, wrote an explicit, personal account of her alleged sexual assault and the ensuing &quot;appalling treatment&quot; she received when coming forward to seek support from the college&#x27;s administration. In the narrative, Epifano alleged that she was raped by a fellow Amherst student and described how her life was affected by the experience; she stated that the perpetrator harassed her at the only dining hall, that her academic performance was negatively affected, and that, when she sought support, the administration coerced her into taking the blame for her experience and ultimately institutionalized her and pressured her to drop out.

The fact that such a prestigious institution could have such a noxious interior fills me with intense remorse mixed with sour distaste. I am sickened by the Administration&#x27;s attempts to cover up survivors&#x27; stories, cook their books to discount rapes, pretend that withdrawals never occur, quell attempts at change, and sweep sexual assaults under a rug. When politicians cover up affairs or scandals the masses often rise in angry protestations and call for a more transparent government. What is the difference between a government and the Amherst College campus? Why can&#x27;t we know what is happening on campus? Why should we be quiet about sexual assault?&quot;

When the Amherst case reached national attention, Annie E. Clark and Andrea Pino, two women who were allegedly sexually assaulted at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill connected with Epifano, Brodsky, and Yale Law School student Dana Bolger to address the parallel concerns of hostility at their institution, filing Title IX and Clery Act complaints against the university in January 2013, both leading to investigations by the U.S. Department of Education.

Following the national prominence of the UNC Chapel Hill case, organizers Pino and Clark went on to coordinate with students at other schools; in 2013, complaints citing violations of Title IX were filed against Occidental College (on April 18), Swarthmore College and the University of Southern California (on May 22). These complaints, the resulting campaigns against sexual violence on college campuses, and the organizing of Bolger, Brodsky, Clark, Pino and other activists led to the formation of an informal national network of activists. Bolger and Brodsky also started Know Your IX, an organization of student activists focused on legal education and federal and state policy change.

Title IX has been interpreted as allowing private lawsuits against educational institutions as well as formal complaints submitted to the Department of Education. In 2006, a federal court found that there was sufficient evidence that the University of Colorado acted with &quot;deliberate indifference&quot; toward students Lisa Simpson and Anne Gilmore, who were sexually assaulted by student football players. The university settled the case by promising to change its policies and to pay $2.5 million in damages. In 2008, Arizona State University was the subject of a lawsuit that alleged violations of rights guaranteed by Title IX: the university expelled a football player for multiple instances of severe sexual harassment, but readmitted him; he went on to rape a fellow student in her dorm room. Despite its claim that it bore no responsibility, the school settled the lawsuit, agreeing to revise and improve its official response to sexual misconduct and to pay the plaintiff $850,000 in damages and fees.

The Trump administration made changes to guidelines that were implemented during the Obama administration. These changes shifted the standard of evidence used in Title IX investigations from &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; to a &quot;clear and convincing&quot; evidence standard, which is typically used for civil cases in which serious allegations are made (as opposed to the standard of beyond reasonable doubt in criminal cases). On September 22, 2017, US Department of Education Secretary Betsy Devos rescinded the Obama-era guidelines which had prodded colleges and universities to more aggressively investigate campus sexual assaults. On May 7, 2020, the U.S. Department of Education released final regulations governing campus sexual assault under Title IX, the first Title IX guidance published by the Office of Civil Rights to go through a formal notice-and-comment process since 1997. Some of the new regulations made in May 2020 involve defining sexual harassment to include &quot;sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking,&quot; as discrimination, as well as require schools to offer attainable options for anyone to report a sexual harassment case. Unlike guidance issued by the Obama administration in 2011 and 2014, they will have the force of law behind them. Colleges and universities will be required to comply with the regulations by Aug. 14. On February 10, 2022, the Department of Education issued guidance on how schools should implement the new Title IX regulations. This guidance includes specific information on how schools should prevent and respond to sexual harassment.

On June 23, 2022, the Biden administration issued a proposed rule to reverse the changes made by the final rule and to expand coverage regarding gender identity and pregnancy.

===Transgender students===
Under the Obama administration, the U.S. Department of Education-issued guidance asserted that transgender students are protected from sex-based discrimination under Title IX. In particular, Title IX of its Education Amendments of 1972 bars schools that receive financial aid assistance from sex-based discrimination in education programs and activities. It instructed public schools to treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity in academic life. A student who identifies as a transgender boy, for instance, is allowed entry to a boys-only class, and a student who identifies as a transgender girl is allowed entry to a girls-only class. This also applies to academic records if that student is over the age of eighteen at a university. The memo states in part that &quot;[a]ll students, including transgender students, or students who do not conform to sex stereotypes, are protected from sex-based discrimination under Title IX. Under Title IX, a recipient generally must treat transgender, or gender non-conforming, consistent with their gender identity in all aspects of the planning, implementation, enrollment, operation, and evaluation of single-sex classes.&quot;

However, starting in 2017 with the Trump administration, several of these policies have been rolled back. In February 2017, the Departments of Justice and Education (headed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, respectively) withdrew the guidance on gender identity. The Education Department announced on February 12, 2018, that Title IX did not allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their gender identities.

Dwayne Bensing, a lawyer for the Office of Civil Rights within the United States Department of Education and who was in its LGBTQ affinity group, had unsuccessfully asked DeVos not to withdraw the Obama administration guidance. Two years later, in the summer of 2019, Bensing discovered that the Education Department was fast-tracking the Alliance Defending Freedom&#x27;s complaint against transgender student-athletes, even though the department&#x27;s attorneys did not understand the legal basis for doing so and the department had to pressure other employees. Bensing leaked this information to the &quot;Washington Blade&quot; and was forced to resign in December 2019.

In October 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; obtained a memo issued by the Department of Health and Human Services that would propose a strict definition of gender for Title IX, using the person&#x27;s sex as determined at birth and could not be changed, effectively limiting recognition of transgender students and potentially others. The memo stated that the government needed to define gender &quot;on a biological basis that is clear, grounded in science, objective and administrable&quot;. The news brought immediate protests in several locations as well as online social media under the &quot;#WontBeErased&quot; hashtag.

In May 2020, the Trump administration&#x27;s Department of Education contended that the rights of cisgender women are infringed upon by transgender women. The Education Department started to withhold federal funding to schools which affirm the identities of transgender athletes.

In August 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed a 2018 lower court ruling in Adams v. The School Board of St. Johns County, Florida that discrimination on the basis of gender identity is discrimination &quot;on the basis of sex&quot; and is prohibited under Title IX (federal civil rights law) and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution.

In December 2020, the &quot;Protect Women in Sports&quot; Act was introduced to the U.S. House of Representatives. It would block schools from receiving federal funding if transgender girls and nonbinary people are allowed to compete on girls&#x27; sports teams at those schools. It was sponsored by Representatives Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat, and Markwayne Mullin, a Republican.

In 2021, the Biden administration took steps to reinstate some of the protections for transgender students that had been rescinded under the Trump administration. These included two executive orders—13988 in January 2021 and 14021 in March 2021—which were supported by the US Department of Education, though their ability to implement their guidance was limited in June 2022 within the states of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, South Carolina, South Dakota, and West Virginia.

On January 9, 2025, U.S. District court judge Danny C. Reeves of Kentucky struck down the Biden administration’s expanded protections, striking down the change nationwide.

On January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump, during his second administration, issued Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government which, for the purposes of the federal government, defined the sex of a person as their sex at conception. It also said that this sex could not be changed during a person&#x27;s life. The order also rescinded Biden&#x27;s executive orders 13988 and 14021 which defined a person&#x27;s sex as their self assessed gender identity.

==OCR&#x27;s test for Title IX compliance==

Title IX has been a source of controversy in part due to claims that the OCR&#x27;s current interpretation of Title IX, and specifically its three-prong test of compliance, is no longer faithful to the anti-discrimination language in Title IX&#x27;s text, and instead discriminates against men and has contributed to the reduction of programs for male athletes.

Critics of the three-prong test contend that it operates as a &quot;quota&quot; in that it places undue emphasis on the first prong (known as the &quot;proportionality&quot; prong), which fails to take into account any differences in the genders&#x27; respective levels of interest in participating in athletics (despite the third prong, which focuses on any differences in the genders&#x27; respective levels of interest in participation). Instead, it requires that the genders&#x27; athletic participation be substantially proportionate to their enrollment, without regard to interest. Prong two is viewed as only a temporary fix for universities, as universities may only point to the past expansion of opportunities for female students for a limited time before compliance with another prong is necessary. Critics say that prong three likewise fails to consider male athletic interest despite its gender-neutral language, as it requires that the university fully and effectively accommodate the athletic interests of the &quot;underrepresented sex&quot;, even though ED regulations expressly require that the OCR consider whether the institution &quot;effectively accommodate[s] the interests and abilities of members of both sexes&quot;. As such, with a focus on increasing female athletic opportunities without any counterbalance to consider male athletic interest, critics maintain that the OCR&#x27;s three-prong test operates to discriminate against men.

Defenders of the three-prong test counter that the genders&#x27; differing athletic interest levels are merely a product of past discrimination, and that Title IX should be interpreted to maximize female participation in athletics regardless of any existing disparity in interest. Thus while defenders argue that the three-prong test embodies the maxim that &quot;opportunity drives interest&quot;, critics argue that the three-prong test goes beyond Title IX original purpose of preventing discrimination, and instead amounts to an exercise in which athletic opportunities are taken away from male students and given to female students, despite the comparatively lower interest levels of those female students. Author and self-described women&#x27;s rights advocate John Irving opined in a &quot;New York Times&quot; column that on this topic, women&#x27;s advocates were being &quot;purely vindictive&quot; in insisting that the current OCR interpretation of Title IX be maintained.

On March 17, 2005, OCR announced a clarification of prong three of the three-part test of Title IX compliance. The guidance concerned the use of web-based surveys to determine the level of interest in varsity athletics among the underrepresented sex. Opponents of the clarification – including the NCAA Executive Committee, which issued a resolution soon afterward asking Association members not to use the survey – claimed the survey was flawed in part because of the way it counted non-responses. On April 20, 2010, the U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s Office for Civil Rights abandoned the 2005 clarification that allowed institutions to use only Internet or e‑mail surveys to meet the interests and abilities (third prong) option of the three-part test for Title IX compliance.

In February 2010, the United States Commission on Civil Rights weighed in on the OCR&#x27;s three-prong test, offering several recommendations on Title IX policy to address what it termed &quot;unnecessary reduction of men&#x27;s athletic opportunities&quot;. The commission advocated use of surveys to measure interest, and specifically recommended that the Department of Education&#x27;s regulations on interest and abilities be revised &quot;to explicitly take into account the interest of both sexes rather than just the interest of the underrepresented sex&quot;, almost always females.

==Legacy and recognition==
On the twenty-fifth anniversary of Title IX the National Women&#x27;s Law Center lodged twenty-five complaints with the U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s Office for Civil Rights.

After Title IX was implemented, there was controversy about the amount of athletic integration, especially among female education leaders who worried about girls being injured or bullied by rough boys in coeducational activities. While there were always some parents and administrators who did not like the idea of coed gym classes, that has in fact become the norm as a result of Title IX.

There were several events praising the 40th anniversary of Title IX in June 2012. For example, the White House Council on Women and Girls hosted a panel to discuss the life-altering nature of sports. Panelists included Billie Jean King, All‑American NCAA point guard Shoni Schimmel of the University of Louisville, and Aimee Mullins, the first double-amputee sprinter to compete in NCAA track and field for Georgetown University.

President Barack Obama wrote a pro–Title IX op-ed published in &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine.

The Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation honored over 40 female athletes.

On June 21, 2012, espnW projected a digital mosaic featuring the largest-ever collection of women and girls&#x27; sports images (all of which were submitted by the athletes themselves) onto the First Amendment tablet of the Newseum in Washington, D.C. The mosaic also included photos of espnW&#x27;s Top 40 Athletes of the Past 40 Years.

&quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot; produced its first &quot;Women in Sports&quot; issue in June 2012, and in the same month ESPN Classic first showed the documentary &quot;Sporting Chance: The Lasting Legacy of Title IX&quot;, narrated by Holly Hunter. It also showed the documentary &quot;On the Basis of Sex: The Battle for Title IX in Sports&quot;, and other programming related to women&#x27;s sports.

In 2013 ESPN Films broadcast &quot;Nine for IX&quot;, a series of documentaries about women in sports. &quot;Good Morning America&quot; anchor Robin Roberts and Tribeca Productions co founder Jane Rosenthal are executive producers of the series.

The NCAA announced in April 2019 that it would hold its 2023 Division II and Division III women&#x27;s basketball championship games at American Airlines Center in Dallas, which had previously been announced as the site for that season&#x27;s Division I women&#x27;s Final Four. In its announcement, the NCAA explicitly called the joint championship event &quot;a 50th-year celebration of Title IX&quot; (as that particular basketball season will begin in calendar 2022).

==Criticism==
Concern has been expressed that colleges have been overly aggressive in enforcing Title IX regulations, particularly about sexual matters. Laura Kipnis, author of &quot;How to Become a Scandal: Adventures in Bad Behavior&quot; (New York: Metropolitan Books, 2010), and others have argued that Title IX regulations have empowered investigators who routinely endanger academic freedom and fair process, presume the guilt of suspects, assign the man full responsibility for the outcome of any social interaction, and minutely regulate personal relationships.

Writing in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Emily Yoffe has criticized the Title IX process for being unfair to the accused, based on faulty science, and racially biased against students of color.

<doc id="96909" wikidata="Q5100783" url="?curid=96909" title="Chinese fire drill">
<text>&quot;Chinese fire drill&quot; is a predominantly American slang term for a situation that is chaotic or confusing, possibly due to poor or misunderstood instructions. It may also be known as a Polish fire drill or, increasingly, simply as a fire drill.

The phrase has been critiqued due to it associating &quot;Chinese&quot; as a descriptor with incompetence, chaos or otherwise poor quality.

== Origins ==
The term is generally regarded as having originated with British troops either during or prior to WWI, with the phrase then spreading to their American counterparts due to their mixing throughout the war. The phrase then remained popular in American English while eventually falling out of use elsewhere.

One specific tale of the phrase&#x27;s origin is alleged to have occurred in the 1900s when a ship run by British officers and a Chinese crew practiced a fire drill for a fire in the engine room. The bucket brigade were to draw water from the starboard side, pass it to the engine room, and pour it onto the simulated &quot;fire&quot;. To prevent flooding, a separate crew was ordered to ferry the accumulated water from the engine room up to the main deck, and to heave the water over the port side. The drill had previously gone according to plan, until the orders were confused in interpretation. The bucket brigade began to draw the water from the starboard side, run directly over to the port side and then throw the water overboard, bypassing the engine room completely. 

Alternatively, the phrase&#x27;s origin may lie in the historical Western use of the word &quot;Chinese&quot; to denote &quot;confusion&quot; and &quot;incomprehensibility&quot;, which historians trace to the earliest contacts between Europeans and Chinese people in the 1600s, attributing it to Europeans&#x27; inability to understand China&#x27;s radically different culture and world view. In his 1989 &quot;Dictionary of Invective&quot;, British editor Hugh Rawson lists 16 phrases that use the word &quot;Chinese&quot; to denote &quot;incompetence, fraud and disorganization&quot;.

Other examples of such use include:
* &quot;Chinese puzzle&quot;, a puzzle with a nonexistent or a hard-to-fathom solution.
* &quot;Chinese whispers&quot;, a children&#x27;s game in which a straightforward statement is shared through a sequence of players, one player at a time, until it reaches the end, often getting comically transformed along the way into a completely different statement. This game is also known as &quot;broken telephone&quot; in North America and &quot;wire-less telephone&quot; in Brazil.
* &quot;Chinese ace&quot;, an inept pilot, derived from the term &quot;one wing low&quot; (which supposedly sounds like a Chinese name), an aeronautical maneuver.

== Other uses ==
The term can also refer to a prank originating in the 1960s in which the occupants of an automobile jump out, run around the vehicle, and jump back in at a different door, usually at a red light or other form of traffic stoppage. This is sometimes also used to refer to a driver and passenger intentionally switching places in the middle of the road because the driver is having trouble with road conditions.

Additionally, the term is documented to have been used in the US Marine Corps during World War II, where it was often expressed in the phrase &quot;as screwed up as a Chinese fire drill&quot;. It was also commonly used by Americans during the Korean War and the Vietnam War.

== Offensiveness ==
Public use of the phrase has been considered to be offensive and racist. In 2017, a candidate for office in Nova Scotia, Matt Whitman, apologized for using the term in a video and subsequently removed the video. In 2020, Washington state Senator Patty Kuderer made an apology for using the term in a hearing; Linda Yang of Washington Asians for Equality stated that the term was racist and filed a complaint with the state. Kuderer apologized before any formal complaint was filed.

== In popular culture ==
A Chinese Firedrill is the name of a music project by Armored Saint and Fates Warning bassist Joey Vera. It released an album, &quot;Circles&quot;, in 2007. The album uses different musical foundations in each song, such that it is &quot;chaotic or confusing&quot;, like a Chinese fire drill.

In The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson, the first episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; season 9, a retailer in Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown shouts out &quot;Chinese fire drill!&quot; as Bart Simpson sets a firework at his shop.

<text>Respiratory complex I, (also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, Type I NADH dehydrogenase and mitochondrial complex I) is the first large protein complex of the respiratory chains of many organisms from bacteria to humans. It catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and translocates protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes or the plasma membrane of bacteria.

This enzyme is essential for the normal functioning of cells, and mutations in its subunits lead to a wide range of inherited neuromuscular and metabolic disorders. Defects in this enzyme are responsible for the development of several pathological processes such as ischemia/reperfusion damage (stroke and cardiac infarction), Parkinson&#x27;s disease and others.

== Function ==

Complex I is the first enzyme of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. There are three energy-transducing enzymes in the electron transport chain - NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I), Coenzyme Q – cytochrome c reductase (complex III), and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV). Complex I is the largest and most complicated enzyme of the electron transport chain.

The reaction catalyzed by complex I is:

:NADH + H+ + CoQ + 4H+in→ NAD+ + CoQH2 + 4H+out

In this process, the complex translocates four protons across the inner membrane per molecule of oxidized NADH, helping to build the electrochemical potential difference used to produce ATP. &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) is capable of proton translocation in the same direction to the established Δψ, showing that in the tested conditions, the coupling ion is H+. Na+ transport in the opposite direction was observed, and although Na+ was not necessary for the catalytic or proton transport activities, its presence increased the latter. H+ was translocated by the &quot;Paracoccus denitrificans&quot; complex I, but in this case, H+ transport was not influenced by Na+, and Na+ transport was not observed. Possibly, the &quot;E. coli&quot; complex I has two energy coupling sites (one Na+ independent and the other Na+dependent), as observed for the &quot;Rhodothermus marinus&quot; complex I, whereas the coupling mechanism of the &quot;P. denitrificans&quot; enzyme is completely Na+ independent. It is also possible that another transporter catalyzes the uptake of Na+. Complex I energy transduction by proton pumping may not be exclusive to the &quot;R. marinus&quot; enzyme. The Na+/H+ antiport activity seems not to be a general property of complex I. However, the existence of Na+-translocating activity of the complex I is still in question.

The reaction can be reversed – referred to as aerobic succinate-supported NAD+ reduction by ubiquinol – in the presence of a high membrane potential, but the exact catalytic mechanism remains unknown. Driving force of this reaction is a potential across the membrane which can be maintained either by ATP-hydrolysis or by complexes III and IV during succinate oxidation.

Complex I may have a role in triggering apoptosis. In fact, there has been shown to be a correlation between mitochondrial activities and programmed cell death (PCD) during somatic embryo development.

Complex I is not homologous to Na+-translocating NADH Dehydrogenase (NDH) Family (TC# 3.D.1), a member of the Na+ transporting Mrp superfamily.

As a result of a two NADH molecule being oxidized to NAD+, three molecules of ATP can be produced by Complex V (ATP synthase) downstream in the respiratory chain.

==Mechanism==

=== Overall mechanism ===
All redox reactions take place in the hydrophilic domain of complex I. NADH initially binds to complex I, and transfers two electrons to the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) prosthetic group of the enzyme, creating FMNH2. The electron acceptor – the isoalloxazine ring – of FMN is identical to that of FAD. The electrons are then transferred through the FMN via a series of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, and finally to coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone). This electron flow changes the redox state of the protein, inducing conformational changes of the protein which alters the p&quot;K&quot; values of ionizable side chain, and causes four hydrogen ions to be pumped out of the mitochondrial matrix. Ubiquinone (CoQ) accepts two electrons to be reduced to ubiquinol (CoQH2).

=== Electron transfer mechanism ===
The proposed pathway for electron transport prior to ubiquinone reduction is as follows: NADH – FMN – N3 – N1b – N4 – N5 – N6a – N6b – N2 – Q, where Nx is a labelling convention for iron sulfur clusters. The high reduction potential of the N2 cluster and the relative proximity of the other clusters in the chain enable efficient electron transfer over long distance in the protein (with transfer rates from NADH to N2 iron-sulfur cluster of about 100 μs).

The equilibrium dynamics of Complex I are primarily driven by the quinone redox cycle. In conditions of high proton motive force (and accordingly, a ubiquinol-concentrated pool), the enzyme runs in the reverse direction. Ubiquinol is oxidized to ubiquinone, and the resulting released protons reduce the proton motive force.

=== Proton translocation mechanism ===
The coupling of proton translocation and electron transport in Complex I is currently proposed as being indirect (long range conformational changes) as opposed to direct (redox intermediates in the hydrogen pumps as in heme groups of Complexes III and IV). The architecture of the hydrophobic region of complex I shows multiple proton transporters that are mechanically interlinked. The three central components believed to contribute to this long-range conformational change event are the pH-coupled N2 iron-sulfur cluster, the quinone reduction, and the transmembrane helix subunits of the membrane arm. Transduction of conformational changes to drive the transmembrane transporters linked by a &#x27;connecting rod&#x27; during the reduction of ubiquinone can account for two or three of the four protons pumped per NADH oxidized. The remaining proton must be pumped by direct coupling at the ubiquinone-binding site. It is proposed that direct and indirect coupling mechanisms account for the pumping of the four protons.

The N2 cluster&#x27;s proximity to a nearby cysteine residue results in a conformational change upon reduction in the nearby helices, leading to small but important changes in the overall protein conformation. Further electron paramagnetic resonance studies of the electron transfer have demonstrated that most of the energy that is released during the subsequent CoQ reduction is on the final ubiquinol formation step from semiquinone, providing evidence for the &quot;single stroke&quot; H+ translocation mechanism (i.e. all four protons move across the membrane at the same time). Alternative theories suggest a &quot;two stroke mechanism&quot; where each reduction step (semiquinone and ubiquinol) results in a stroke of two protons entering the intermembrane space.

The resulting ubiquinol localized to the membrane domain interacts with negatively charged residues in the membrane arm, stabilizing conformational changes. An antiporter mechanism (Na+/H+ swap) has been proposed using evidence of conserved Asp residues in the membrane arm. The presence of Lys, Glu, and His residues enable for proton gating (a protonation followed by deprotonation event across the membrane) driven by the pKa of the residues.

== Composition and structure ==

NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase is the largest of the respiratory complexes. In mammals, the enzyme contains 44 separate water-soluble peripheral membrane proteins, which are anchored to the integral membrane constituents. Of particular functional importance are the flavin prosthetic group (FMN) and eight iron-sulfur clusters (FeS). Of the 44 subunits, seven are encoded by the mitochondrial genome.

The structure is an &quot;L&quot; shape with a long membrane domain (with around 60 trans-membrane helices) and a hydrophilic (or peripheral) domain, which includes all the known redox centres and the NADH binding site. All thirteen of the &quot;E. coli&quot; proteins, which comprise NADH dehydrogenase I, are encoded within the &quot;nuo&quot; operon, and are homologous to mitochondrial complex I subunits. The antiporter-like subunits NuoL/M/N each contains 14 conserved transmembrane (TM) helices. Two of them are discontinuous, but subunit NuoL contains a 110 Å long amphipathic α-helix, spanning the entire length of the domain. The subunit, NuoL, is related to Na+/ H+ antiporters of TC# 2.A.63.1.1 (PhaA and PhaD).

Three of the conserved, membrane-bound subunits in NADH dehydrogenase are related to each other, and to Mrp sodium-proton antiporters. Structural analysis of two prokaryotic complexes I revealed that the three subunits each contain fourteen transmembrane helices that overlay in structural alignments: the translocation of three protons may be coordinated by a lateral helix connecting them.

Complex I contains a ubiquinone binding pocket at the interface of the 49-kDa and PSST subunits. Close to iron-sulfur cluster N2, the proposed immediate electron donor for ubiquinone, a highly conserved tyrosine constitutes a critical element of the quinone reduction site. A possible quinone exchange path leads from cluster N2 to the N-terminal beta-sheet of the 49-kDa subunit. All 45 subunits of the bovine NDHI have been sequenced. Each complex contains noncovalently bound FMN, coenzyme Q and several iron-sulfur centers. The bacterial NDHs have 8-9 iron-sulfur centers.

A recent study used electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra and double electron-electron resonance (DEER) to determine the path of electron transfer through the iron-sulfur complexes, which are located in the hydrophilic domain. Seven of these clusters form a chain from the flavin to the quinone binding sites; the eighth cluster is located on the other side of the flavin, and its function is unknown. The EPR and DEER results suggest an alternating or “roller-coaster” potential energy profile for the electron transfer between the active sites and along the iron-sulfur clusters, which can optimize the rate of electron travel and allow efficient energy conversion in complex I.

==Inhibitors==
Inhibition of complex I is the mode of action of the METI acaricides and insecticides: fenazaquin, fenpyroximate, pyrimidifen, pyridaben, tebufenpyrad, and tolfenpyrad. They are assigned to IRAC group 21A. Perhaps the best-known inhibitor of complex I is rotenone, which is used as a piscicide and previously commonly used as an organic pesticide, but now banned in many countries. It is in IRAC group 21B. Rotenone and rotenoids are isoflavonoids occurring in several genera of tropical plants such as Antonia (&quot;Loganiaceae&quot;), Derris and Lonchocarpus (&quot;Faboideae&quot;, &quot;Fabaceae&quot;). There have been reports of the indigenous people of French Guiana using rotenone-containing plants to fish - due to its ichthyotoxic effect - as early as the 17th century. Rotenone binds to the ubiquinone binding site of complex I as well as piericidin A, another potent inhibitor with a close structural homologue to ubiquinone.

Acetogenins from Annonaceae are even more potent inhibitors of complex I. They cross-link to the ND2 subunit, which suggests that ND2 is essential for quinone-binding. Rolliniastatin-2, an acetogenin, is the first complex I inhibitor found that does not share the same binding site as rotenone. Bullatacin (an acetogenin found in &quot;Asimina triloba&quot; fruit) is the most potent known inhibitor of NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) (=1.2 nM, stronger than rotenone). 

Despite more than 50 years of study of complex I, no inhibitors blocking the electron flow inside the enzyme have been found. Hydrophobic inhibitors like rotenone or piericidin most likely disrupt the electron transfer between the terminal FeS cluster N2 and ubiquinone. It has been shown that long-term systemic inhibition of complex I by rotenone can induce selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.

Complex I is also blocked by adenosine diphosphate ribose – a reversible competitive inhibitor of NADH oxidation – by binding to the enzyme at the nucleotide binding site. Both hydrophilic NADH and hydrophobic ubiquinone analogs act at the beginning and the end of the internal electron-transport pathway, respectively.

The antidiabetic drug Metformin has been shown to induce a mild and transient inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, and this inhibition appears to play a key role in its mechanism of action.

Inhibition of complex I has been implicated in hepatotoxicity associated with a variety of drugs, for instance flutamide and nefazodone. Further, complex I inhibition was shown to trigger NAD+-independent glucose catabolism.

==Active/inactive transition==

The catalytic properties of eukaryotic complex I are not simple. Two catalytically and structurally distinct forms exist in any given preparation of the enzyme: one is the fully competent, so-called “active” A-form and the other is the catalytically silent, dormant, “inactive”, D-form. After exposure of idle enzyme to elevated, but physiological temperatures (&gt;30 °C) in the absence of substrate, the enzyme converts to the D-form. This form is catalytically incompetent but can be activated by the slow reaction (k~4 min−1) of NADH oxidation with subsequent ubiquinone reduction. After one or several turnovers the enzyme becomes active and can catalyse physiological NADH:ubiquinone reaction at a much higher rate (k~104 min−1). In the presence of divalent cations (Mg2+, Ca2+), or at alkaline pH the activation takes much longer.

The high activation energy (270 kJ/mol) of the deactivation process indicates the occurrence of major conformational changes in the organisation of the complex I. However, until now, the only conformational difference observed between these two forms is the number of cysteine residues exposed at the surface of the enzyme. Treatment of the D-form of complex I with the sulfhydryl reagents N-Ethylmaleimide or DTNB irreversibly blocks critical cysteine residues, abolishing the ability of the enzyme to respond to activation, thus inactivating it irreversibly. The A-form of complex I is insensitive to sulfhydryl reagents.

It was found that these conformational changes may have a very important physiological significance. The inactive, but not the active form of complex I was susceptible to inhibition by nitrosothiols and peroxynitrite. It is likely that transition from the active to the inactive form of complex I takes place during pathological conditions when the turnover of the enzyme is limited at physiological temperatures, such as during hypoxia, ischemia or when the tissue nitric oxide:oxygen ratio increases (i.e. metabolic hypoxia).

==Production of superoxide==

Recent investigations suggest that complex I is a potent source of reactive oxygen species. Complex I can produce superoxide (as well as hydrogen peroxide), through at least two different pathways. During forward electron transfer, only very small amounts of superoxide are produced (probably less than 0.1% of the overall electron flow).

During reverse electron transfer, complex I might be the most important site of superoxide production within mitochondria, with around 3-4% of electrons being diverted to superoxide formation. Reverse electron transfer, the process by which electrons from the reduced ubiquinol pool (supplied by succinate dehydrogenase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, electron-transferring flavoprotein or dihydroorotate dehydrogenase in mammalian mitochondria) pass through complex I to reduce NAD+ to NADH, driven by the inner mitochondrial membrane potential electric potential. Although it is not precisely known under what pathological conditions reverse-electron transfer would occur in vivo, in vitro experiments indicate that this process can be a very potent source of superoxide when succinate concentrations are high and oxaloacetate or malate concentrations are low. This can take place during tissue ischaemia, when oxygen delivery is blocked.

Superoxide is a reactive oxygen species that contributes to cellular oxidative stress and is linked to neuromuscular diseases and aging. NADH dehydrogenase produces superoxide by transferring one electron from FMNH2 (or semireduced flavin) to oxygen (O2). The radical flavin leftover is unstable, and transfers the remaining electron to the iron-sulfur centers. It is the ratio of NADH to NAD+ that determines the rate of superoxide formation.

==Pathology==
Mutations in the subunits of complex I can cause mitochondrial diseases, including Leigh syndrome. Point mutations in various complex I subunits derived from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can also result in Leber&#x27;s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy.There is some evidence that complex I defects may play a role in the etiology of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, perhaps because of reactive oxygen species (complex I can, like complex III, leak electrons to oxygen, forming highly toxic superoxide).

Although the exact etiology of Parkinson&#x27;s disease is unclear, it is likely that mitochondrial dysfunction, along with proteasome inhibition and environmental toxins, may play a large role. In fact, the inhibition of complex I has been shown to cause the production of peroxides and a decrease in proteasome activity, which may lead to Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Additionally, Esteves et al. (2010) found that cell lines with Parkinson&#x27;s disease show increased proton leakage in complex I, which causes decreased maximum respiratory capacity.

Brain ischemia/reperfusion injury is mediated via complex I impairment. Recently it was found that oxygen deprivation leads to conditions in which mitochondrial complex I lose its natural cofactor, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and become inactive. When oxygen is present the enzyme catalyzes a physiological reaction of NADH oxidation by ubiquinone, supplying electrons downstream of the respiratory chain (complexes III and IV). Ischemia leads to dramatic increase of succinate level. In the presence of succinate mitochondria catalyze reverse electron transfer so that fraction of electrons from succinate is directed upstream to FMN of complex I. Reverse electron transfer results in a reduction of complex I FMN, increased generation of ROS, followed by a loss of the reduced cofactor (FMNH2) and impairment of mitochondria energy production. The FMN loss by complex I and I/R injury can be alleviated by the administration of FMN precursor, riboflavin.

Recent studies have examined other roles of complex I activity in the brain. Andreazza et al. (2010) found that the level of complex I activity was significantly decreased in patients with bipolar disorder, but not in patients with depression or schizophrenia. They found that patients with bipolar disorder showed increased protein oxidation and nitration in their prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that future studies should target complex I for potential therapeutic studies for bipolar disorder. Similarly, Moran et al. (2010) found that patients with severe complex I deficiency showed decreased oxygen consumption rates and slower growth rates. However, they found that mutations in different genes in complex I lead to different phenotypes, thereby explaining the variations of pathophysiological manifestations of complex I deficiency.

Exposure to pesticides can also inhibit complex I and cause disease symptoms. For example, chronic exposure to low levels of dichlorvos, an organophosphate used as a pesticide, has been shown to cause liver dysfunction. This occurs because dichlorvos alters complex I and II activity levels, which leads to decreased mitochondrial electron transfer activities and decreased ATP synthesis.

== In chloroplasts ==
A proton-pumping, ubiquinone-using NADH dehydrogenase complex, homologous to complex I, is found in the chloroplast genomes of most land plants under the name &quot;ndh&quot;. This complex is inherited from the original symbiosis from cyanobacteria, but has been lost in most eukaryotic algae, some gymnosperms (&quot;Pinus&quot; and gnetophytes), and some very young lineages of angiosperms. The purpose of this complex is originally cryptic as chloroplasts do not participate in respiration, but now it is known that &quot;ndh&quot; serves to maintain photosynthesis in stressful situations. This makes it at least partially dispensable in favorable conditions. It is evident that angiosperm lineages without &quot;ndh&quot; do not last long from their young ages, but how gymnosperms survive on land without &quot;ndh&quot; for so long is unknown.

<doc id="96914" wikidata="Q1757934" url="?curid=96914" title="Pitch pipe">
<text>A pitch pipe is a small device (type of tuning [[Harmonica]]) used to provide a pitch reference for musicians. Although it may be described as a musical instrument, it is not typically used to play music as such. 

== Origins ==
The earliest pitch pipes were instruments similar to the recorder, but rather than finger holes, they had a plunger like a slide whistle&#x27;s (also known as a &quot;swanee whistle&quot;) making it essentially a type of Slide Whistle. The pipe was generally made of wood with a square bore, and the plunger was leather-coated. On this plunger are marked the notes of either the chromatic scale or the diatonic scale, and by setting it to the correct position, the indicated note will be produced when the instrument is blown. Pitch pipes come in all sorts of shapes and sizes.

Pitch pipes of this sort were most often used in the 18th and 19th centuries in churches which had no organ to give the opening note of a hymn. They are now quite rare, and hardly ever used for what they were intended for, but may still be used as an alternative to a tuning fork. They are also useful for establishing what pitch standard was being used at a particular place and time.

== Modern pitch pipes ==
Although few look like a pipe, the pitch pipe name is still applied to any device used as a pitch reference. The most common type is a circular free reed aerophone. These are discs with the holes for the reeds around the perimeter and with marked openings for each note, into which the user blows. Inside the pipe, the air flows through a hole in a plate past the selected rectangular metal reed (usually brass). The airflow is modulated by the oscillating reed, then it resonates in an outer sounding chamber. In recent years, electronic push-button devices simulating chromatic pitch pipes have become available which are small enough to fit on key chains.

== Usage ==
Some pitch pipes are intended for tuning string instruments, and only provide reeds for notes appropriate to a particular instrument. Chromatic pitch pipes are favored by &quot;a cappella&quot; singers and timpanists. Chromatic pipes most often provide thirteen pitches, each a half step above the previous. By providing all of the notes of a single octave, a singer can start in any key called for in Western music. Different pipes are available for bass and treble voices due to variations in vocal range. Most male and female performers prefer to use F-F pipes and C-C pipes, respectively. However, it is particularly notable that the Men&#x27;s pipe in F is pitched higher than the Women&#x27;s C pipe. Pipes in other keys are available, but are much more rare.

The singers&#x27; normal use of the pipe is to play the initial key note or tonic of the piece to be sung. Less frequently the pipe will be used to play the first sung note of the song, especially where the song begins in unison or with a solo.

In Ethnomusicology, recording a short beep with pitch pipe in ethnographic recordings can be used in playback to determine the playback speed of the Gramophone record or Phonograph cylinder.

== Problems ==
The brass reeds in common pitchpipes are subject to work hardening with use, so they gradually change pitch. Because of this, replacement reed plates are sold. Carried in a pocket, a pipe will occasionally pick up small bits of lint which works its way into the narrow space around a reed. This usually requires disassembly of the pipe in order to clean the lint off the reed. To avoid this eventuality many users will use a small holster to carry the pipe.

<doc id="96917" wikidata="Q808329" url="?curid=96917" title="Barley wine">
<text>Barley wine is a strong ale from 6–12% alcohol by volume.

==History==

The first beer to be marketed as barley wine was Bass No. 1 Ale, around 1870.

The Anchor Brewing Company introduced the style to the United States in 1976 with its Old Foghorn Barleywine Style Ale. Old Foghorn was styled as &quot;barleywine&quot; (one word) out of fear that occurrence of the word &quot;wine&quot; on a beer label would displease regulators. In 1983, Sierra Nevada Brewing released Bigfoot Barleywine, becoming the second barley wine label in the United States.

==Characteristics==
Barley wine typically reaches an alcohol strength of 6 to 12% by volume and is brewed from specific gravities as high as 1.120; equal to 320g/L of sugars. Use of the word &quot;wine&quot; is due to its alcoholic strength similar to a wine, but since it is made from grain rather than fruit, it is a beer. Breweries in the United States typically release it once a year during the autumn or winter. 

The two primary styles of barley wine are the American, which tends to be hoppier and more bitter, with colours ranging from amber to light brown and the English style, which tends to be less bitter and may have little hop flavour, with more variety in colour ranging from red-gold to opaque black. Until the introduction of an amber-coloured barley wine under the name Gold Label by the Sheffield brewery Tennant&#x27;s in 1951 (later brewed by Whitbread), British barley wines were always dark in colour.

Beer writer Michael Jackson referred to a barley wine by Smithwick&#x27;s thus: &quot;This is very distinctive, with an earthy hoppiness, a wineyness, lots of fruit and toffee flavours.&quot; He also noted that its original gravity is 1.062.

Martyn Cornell was quoted as saying, &quot;no historically meaningful difference exists between barley wines and old ales&quot;. He later clarified, &quot;I don’t believe there is actually any such meaningful style as &#x27;barley wine&#x27;&quot;.

Barley wines, such as Thomas Hardy&#x27;s Ale, are sometimes labelled with a production date, as they are intended to be aged, sometimes extensively.

== Taxes and legal impediments ==
Many jurisdictions have different taxing schemes for potables based upon alcohol content. Since barley wine has a high alcohol content, it is, in some jurisdictions, taxed at a higher rate than other beers. Thus, barley wines tend to suffer a further price premium compared with other beers. Similarly, many jurisdictions have different regulations regarding where beers and wines can be sold, leading to confusion regarding in which category barley wines fall, thus limiting access.

== Wheat wine ==
A variation on the barley wine style involves adding a large quantity of wheat to the mash bill, resulting in what is referred to as &quot;wheat wine&quot;. This style originated in the United States in the 1980s.

<doc id="96918" wikidata="Q412832" url="?curid=96918" title="Coenzyme Q – cytochrome c reductase">
<text>The coenzyme Q : cytochrome &quot;c&quot; – oxidoreductase, sometimes called the cytochrome &quot;bc&quot;1 complex, and at other times complex III, is the third complex in the electron transport chain (), playing a critical role in biochemical generation of ATP (oxidative phosphorylation). Complex III is a multisubunit transmembrane protein encoded by both the mitochondrial (cytochrome b) and the nuclear genomes (all other subunits). Complex III is present in the mitochondria of all animals and all aerobic eukaryotes and the inner membranes of most bacteria. Mutations in Complex III cause exercise intolerance as well as multisystem disorders. The bc1 complex contains 11 subunits, 3 respiratory subunits (cytochrome B, cytochrome C1, Rieske protein), 2 core proteins and 6 low-molecular weight proteins.

Ubiquinol—cytochrome-c reductase catalyzes the chemical reaction

:QH2 + 2 ferricytochrome c formula_1 Q + 2 ferrocytochrome c + 2 H+

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are quinol (QH2) and ferri- (Fe3+) cytochrome c, whereas its 3 products are quinone (Q), ferro- (Fe2+) cytochrome c, and H+.

This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on diphenols and related substances as donor with a cytochrome as acceptor. This enzyme participates in oxidative phosphorylation. It has four cofactors: cytochrome c1, cytochrome b-562, cytochrome b-566, and a 2-Iron ferredoxin of the Rieske type.

== Nomenclature ==

The systematic name of this enzyme class is ubiquinol:ferricytochrome-c oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include:
== Structure ==

Compared to the other major proton-pumping subunits of the electron transport chain, the number of subunits found can be small, as small as three polypeptide chains. This number does increase, and eleven subunits are found in higher animals. Three subunits have prosthetic groups. The cytochrome &quot;b&quot; subunit has two &quot;b&quot;-type hemes (&quot;b&quot;L and &quot;b&quot;H), the cytochrome &quot;c&quot; subunit has one &quot;c&quot;-type heme (&quot;c&quot;1), and the Rieske Iron Sulfur Protein subunit (ISP) has a two iron, two sulfur iron-sulfur cluster (2Fe•2S).

Structures of complex III: , 
== Composition of complex ==

In vertebrates the bc1 complex, or Complex III, contains 11 subunits: 3 respiratory subunits, 2 core proteins and 6 low-molecular weight proteins. Proteobacterial complexes may contain as few as three subunits.

=== Table of subunit composition of complex III ===
* a In vertebrates, a cleavage product of 8 kDa from the N-terminus of the Rieske protein (Signal peptide) is retained in the complex as subunit 9. Thus subunits 10 and 11 correspond to fungal QCR9p and QCR10p.

== Reaction ==

It catalyzes the reduction of cytochrome &quot;c&quot; by
oxidation of coenzyme Q (CoQ) and the concomitant pumping of 4 protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space:

: QH2 + 2 cytochrome &quot;c&quot; (FeIII) + 2 H → Q + 2 cytochrome &quot;c&quot; (FeII) + 4 H

In the process called Q cycle, two protons are consumed from the matrix (M), four protons are released into the inter membrane space (IM) and two electrons are passed to cytochrome &quot;c&quot;.

== Reaction mechanism ==

The reaction mechanism for complex III (cytochrome bc1, coenzyme Q: cytochrome C oxidoreductase) is known as the ubiquinone (&quot;Q&quot;) cycle. In this cycle four protons get released into the positive &quot;P&quot; side (inter membrane space), but only two protons get taken up from the negative &quot;N&quot; side (matrix). As a result, a proton gradient is formed across the membrane. In the overall reaction, two ubiquinols are oxidized to ubiquinones and one ubiquinone is reduced to ubiquinol. In the complete mechanism, two electrons are transferred from ubiquinol to ubiquinone, via two cytochrome c intermediates.

Overall:
* 2 x QH2 oxidised to Q
* 1 x Q reduced to QH2
* 2 x Cyt c reduced
* 4 x H+ released into intermembrane space
* 2 x H+ picked up from matrix

The reaction proceeds according to the following steps:

Round 1:
# Cytochrome b binds a ubiquinol and a ubiquinone.
# The 2Fe/2S center and BL heme each pull an electron off the bound ubiquinol, releasing two protons into the intermembrane space.
# One electron is transferred to cytochrome c1 from the 2Fe/2S centre, whilst another is transferred from the BL heme to the BH Heme.
# Cytochrome c1 transfers its electron to cytochrome c (not to be confused with cytochrome c1), and the BH Heme transfers its electron to a nearby ubiquinone, resulting in the formation of a ubisemiquinone.
# Cytochrome c diffuses. The first ubiquinol (now oxidised to ubiquinone) is released, whilst the semiquinone remains bound.
Round 2:
# A second ubiquinol is bound by cytochrome b.
# The 2Fe/2S center and BL heme each pull an electron off the bound ubiquinol, releasing two protons into the intermembrane space.
# One electron is transferred to cytochrome c1 from the 2Fe/2S centre, whilst another is transferred from the BL heme to the BH Heme.
# Cytochrome c1 then transfers its electron to cytochrome c, whilst the nearby semiquinone produced from round 1 picks up a second electron from the BH heme, along with two protons from the matrix.
# The second ubiquinol (now oxidised to ubiquinone), along with the newly formed ubiquinol are released.

== Inhibitors of complex III ==
There are three distinct groups of Complex III inhibitors.
* Antimycin A binds to the Qi site and inhibits the transfer of electrons in Complex III from heme &quot;b&quot;H to oxidized Q (Qi site inhibitor).
* Myxothiazol and stigmatellin binds to the Qo site and inhibits the transfer of electrons from reduced QH2 to the Rieske Iron sulfur protein. Myxothiazol and stigmatellin bind to distinct but overlapping pockets within the Qo site.
** Myxothiazol binds nearer to cytochrome bL (hence termed a &quot;proximal&quot; inhibitor).
** Stigmatellin binds farther from heme bL and nearer the Rieske Iron sulfur protein, with which it strongly interacts.

Some have been commercialized as fungicides (the strobilurin derivatives, best known of which is azoxystrobin; QoI inhibitors) and as anti-malaria agents (atovaquone). Some Qo site inhibitors have been commercialized as insecticides (IRAC group 20).

Also propylhexedrine inhibits cytochrome c reductase.

== Oxygen free radicals ==
A small fraction of electrons leave the electron transport chain before reaching complex IV. Premature electron leakage to oxygen results in the formation of superoxide. The relevance of this otherwise minor side reaction is that superoxide and other reactive oxygen species are highly toxic and are thought to play a role in several pathologies, as well as aging (the free radical theory of aging). Electron leakage occurs mainly at the Qo site and is stimulated by antimycin A. Antimycin A locks the &quot;b&quot; hemes in the reduced state by preventing their re-oxidation at the Qi site, which, in turn, causes the steady-state concentrations of the Qo semiquinone to rise, the latter species reacting with oxygen to form superoxide. The effect of high membrane potential is thought to have a similar effect. Superoxide produced at the Qo site can be released both into the mitochondrial matrix and into the intermembrane space, where it can then reach the cytosol. This could be explained by the fact that Complex III might produce superoxide as membrane permeable HOO• rather than as membrane impermeable O.

== Human gene names ==

* MT-CYB: mtDNA encoded cytochrome b; mutations associated with exercise intolerance
* CYC1: cytochrome c1
* CYCS: cytochrome c
* UQCRFS1: Rieske iron sulfur protein
* UQCRB: Ubiquinone binding protein, mutation linked with mitochondrial complex III deficiency nuclear type 3
* UQCRH: hinge protein
* UQCRC2: Core 2, mutations linked to mitochondrial complex III deficiency, nuclear type 5
* UQCRC1: Core 1
* UQCR: 6.4KD subunit
* UQCR10: 7.2KD subunit
* TTC19: Newly identified subunit, mutations linked to complex III deficiency nuclear type 2. Helps remove the N-terminal fragment of UQCRFS1, which would otherwise interfere with complex III function.

== Mutations in complex III genes in human disease ==

Mutations in complex III-related genes typically manifest as exercise intolerance. Other mutations have been reported to cause septo-optic dysplasia and multisystem disorders. However, mutations in BCS1L, a gene responsible for proper maturation of complex III, can result in Björnstad syndrome and the GRACILE syndrome, which in neonates are lethal conditions that have multisystem and neurologic manifestations typifying severe mitochondrial disorders. The pathogenicity of several mutations has been verified in model systems such as yeast.

The extent to which these various pathologies are due to bioenergetic deficits or overproduction of superoxide is presently unknown.

<doc id="96920" wikidata="Q281347" url="?curid=96920" title="Hindutva">
<text>Hindutva (; ) is a political ideology encompassing the cultural justification of Hindu nationalism and the belief in establishing Hindu hegemony within India. The political ideology was formulated by Vinayak Damodar Savarkar in 1922. It is used by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), the current ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and other organisations, collectively called the Sangh Parivar. 

Inspired by European fascism, the Hindutva movement has been variously described as a variant of right-wing extremism, as &quot;almost fascist in the classical sense&quot;, adhering to a concept of homogenised majority and cultural hegemony and as a separatist ideology. Some analysts dispute the identification of Hindutva with fascism and suggest that Hindutva is an extreme form of conservatism or ethno-nationalism. 

Proponents of Hindutva, particularly its early ideologues, have used political rhetoric and sometimes misinformation to justify the idea of a Hindu-majority state, where the political and cultural landscape is shaped by Hindu values. This movement, however, has often been criticized for misusing Hindu religious sentiments to divide people along communal lines and for distorting the inclusive and pluralistic nature of Hinduism for political gains. In contrast to Hinduism, which is a spiritual tradition rooted in compassion, tolerance, and non-violence, Hindutva has been criticized for its political manipulation of these ideas to create divisions and for promoting an agenda that can marginalize non-Hindu communities. This political ideology, while drawing on certain aspects of Hindu culture, often misrepresents the core teachings of Hinduism by focusing on political dominance rather than the spiritual, ethical, and philosophical values that the religion embodies.

==Definitions==
===Tertiary sources===
According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED), Hindutva is &quot;Originally: the state or quality of being Hindu; &#x27;Hinduness&#x27;. Now: an ideology advocating, or movement seeking to establish, the hegemony of Hindus and Hinduism within India; Hindu nationalism.&quot; Its etymology, according to the OED, is: &quot;from modern Sanskrit &quot;hindutva&quot; (Hindu qualities, Hindu identity) from &quot;Hindu&quot; (from Hindi &quot;hindū&quot; : see Hindu n.) + classical Sanskrit -tva, suffix forming abstract nouns, after Hindi &quot;hindupan&quot;, in the same sense.&quot; The etymology and meaning of &quot;Hindu&quot;, according to the OED is: &quot;Partly a borrowing from Hindi and Urdu. Partly a borrowing from Persian. Etymons: Urdu &quot;hindū&quot;, Persian &quot;hindū&quot;. from (i) Hindi &quot;hindū&quot; and Urdu &quot;hindū&quot;, originally denoting a person from India, now specifically a follower of Hinduism, and its etymon (ii) Persian &quot;hindū&quot;, in the same senses (Middle Persian hindūg, denoting a person from India), apparently formed already in Old Persian ... &quot;Hindu&quot;, denoting an eastern province of the Achaemenid empire.&quot;

According to &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Encyclopedia of World Religions&quot;, Hindutva is a concept of &quot;Indian cultural, national, and religious identity&quot;. The term &quot;conflates a geographically based religious, cultural, and national identity: a true &#x27;Indian&#x27; is one who partakes of this &quot;Hindu-ness&quot;″. Some Indians insist, however, that Hindutva is primarily a cultural term to refer to the traditional and indigenous heritage of the Indian nation-state, and they compare the relationship between Hindutva and India to that of Zionism and Israel.&quot; This view, as summarised by &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Encyclopedia of World Religions&quot;, holds that &quot;even those who are not religiously Hindu but whose religions originated in India – Jains, Buddhists, Sikhs, and others – share in this historical, cultural, and national essence. Those whose religions were imported to India, meaning primarily the country&#x27;s Muslim and Christian communities, may fall within the boundaries of Hindutva only if they subsume themselves into the majority culture&quot;.

According to the &quot;Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics and International Relations&quot;, &quot;Hindutva, translated as &#x27;Hinduness,&#x27; refers to the ideology of Hindu nationalists, stressing the common culture of the inhabitants of the Indian subcontinent. ... Modern politicians have attempted to play down the racial and anti-Muslim aspects of Hindutva, stressing the inclusiveness of the Indian identity; but the term has Fascist undertones.&quot; According to &quot;The Dictionary of Human Geography&quot;, &quot;Hindutva encapsulates the cultural justification of Hindu nationalism, a &#x27;Hinduness&#x27; allegedly shared by all Hindus.&quot; According to &quot;A Political and Economic Dictionary of South Asia&quot;, &quot;One of the main purposes behind the concept of Hindutva was to construct a collective identity to support the cause of &#x27;Hindu-unity&#x27; (Hindu &quot;Sanghatan&quot;) and to avoid too narrow a definition of Hinduism, which had the consequence of excluding Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains from the Hindu community. Later, Hindu-nationalist ideologues transformed the concept into a strategy to include non-Hindus, in order to widen their social base, and for political mobilization.

According to &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; article on Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, a Hindu and Indian nationalist, &quot;&quot;Hindutva&quot; (&quot;Hinduness&quot;) ... sought to define Indian culture as a manifestation of Hindu values; this concept grew to become a major tenet of Hindu nationalist ideology.&quot; According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Hinduism&quot;, Hindutva as defined in the classic statement of its ideology, is the &quot;culture of the Hindu race&quot; where Hinduism is but an element and &quot;Hindu dharma is a religion practiced by Hindus as well as Sikhs and Buddhists&quot;. The article further states, &quot;proponents of Hindutva have sought to promote the identification of national identity with the religious and broader cultural heritage of Hindus. Measures taken to achieve this end have included attempts to &#x27;reclaim&#x27; individuals judged to have taken up &#x27;alien&#x27; religions, the pursuit of social, cultural and philanthropic activities designed to strengthen awareness of Hindu belonging, and direct political action through various organisations, including recognized political parties such as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).&quot;

=== Savarkar ===
For Savarkar, in &quot;&quot;, Hindutva is an inclusive term of everything Indic. The three essentials of &quot;Hindutva&quot; in Savarkar&#x27;s definition were the common nation (&quot;rashtra&quot;), common race (&quot;jati&quot;), and common culture or civilisation (&quot;sanskriti&quot;). Savarkar used the words &quot;Hindu&quot; and &quot;Sindhu&quot; interchangeably. Those terms were at the foundation of his Hindutva, as geographic, cultural and ethnic concepts, and &quot;religion did not figure in his ensemble&quot;, states Sharma. His elaboration of Hindutva included all Indic religions, i.e. Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. Savarkar restricted &quot;Hindu nationality&quot; to &quot;Indian religions&quot; in the sense that they shared a common culture and fondness for the land of their origin. Savarkar had made clear distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva, that they are not same things as Hindutva does not concern religion or rituals but the basis of India&#x27;s national character.

In summary, Savarkar&#x27;s Hinduism is a concept beyond the practice of religion. It encompasses India&#x27;s cultural, historical, and national identity rooted in Hindu traditions and values. Hindutva is to build a strong Hindu nation, and this is the principle that holds together the customs and culture of this land.

According to Christophe Jaffrelot, a political scientist specialising in South Asia, Savarkar – declaring himself as an atheist – &quot;minimizes the importance of religion in his definition of Hindu&quot;, and instead emphasises an ethnic group with a shared culture and cherished geography. To Savarkar, states Jaffrelot, a Hindu is &quot;first and foremost someone who lives in the area beyond the Indus river, between the Himalayas and the Indian Ocean&quot;. Savarkar composed his ideology in reaction to the &quot;pan-Islamic mobilization of the Khilafat movement&quot;, where Indian Muslims were pledging support to the Istanbul-based Caliph of the Ottoman Empire and to Islamic symbols, his thoughts predominantly reflect deep hostility to Islam and its followers. To Savarkar, states Jaffrelot, &quot;Muslims were the real enemies, not the British&quot;, because their Islamic ideology posed &quot;a threat to the real nation, namely Hindu Rashtra&quot; in his vision. All those who reject this historic &quot;common culture&quot; were excluded by Savarkar. He included those who had converted to Christianity or Islam but accepted and cherished the shared Indic culture, considering them as those who can be re-integrated.

According to Chetan Bhatt, a sociologist specialising in Human Rights and Indian nationalism, Savarkar &quot;distances the idea of Hindu and of Hindutva from Hinduism&quot;. He describes Hindutva, states Bhatt, as &quot;one of the most comprehensive and bewildering synthetic concepts known to the human tongue&quot; and &quot;Hindutva is not a word but a history; not only the spiritual or religious history of our people as at times it is mistaken to be by being confounded with the other cognate term Hinduism, but a history in full&quot;.

Savarkar&#x27;s notion of &quot;Hindutva&quot; formed the foundation for his Hindu nationalism. It was a form of ethnic nationalism per the criteria set by Clifford Geertz, Lloyd Fallers, and Anthony D. Smith.

=== Supreme Court of India ===
The definition and the use of &quot;Hindutva&quot; and its relationship with Hinduism has been a part of several court cases in India. In 1966, the Chief Justice Gajendragadkar wrote for the Supreme Court of India in Yagnapurushdasji (AIR 1966 SC 1127), that &quot;Hinduism is impossible to define&quot;. The court adopted Radhakrishnan&#x27;s submission that Hinduism is complex and &quot;the theist and atheist, the sceptic and agnostic, may all be Hindus if they accept the Hindu system of culture and life&quot;. The Court judged that Hinduism historically has had an &quot;inclusive nature&quot; and it may &quot;broadly be described as a way of life and nothing more&quot;.

The 1966 decision has influenced how the term Hindutva has been understood in later cases, in particular the seven decisions of the Supreme Court in the 1990s that are now called the &quot;Hindutva judgments&quot;. According to Ram Jethmalani, an Indian lawyer and a former president of its Supreme Court Bar Association, the Supreme Court of India in 1995 ruled that &quot;Ordinarily, Hindutva is understood as a way of life or a state of mind and is not to be equated with or understood as religious Hindu fundamentalism ... it is a fallacy and an error of law to proceed on the assumption ... that the use of words Hindutva or Hinduism per se depicts an attitude hostile to all persons practising any religion other than the Hindu religion ... It may well be that these words are used in a speech to promote secularism or to emphasise the way of life of the Indian people and the Indian culture or ethos, or to criticise the policy of any political party as discriminatory or intolerant.&quot; According to Jethmalani, the Supreme Court has properly explained the &quot;true meaning&quot; of the term, and &quot;Hindutva is not hostility to any organised religion nor does it proclaim its superiority of any religion to another&quot;. According to him, it is unfortunate that &quot;the communal propaganda machinery relentlessly disseminates &quot;Hindutva&quot; as a communal word, something that has also become embedded in the minds and language of opinion leaders, including politicians, media, civil society and the intelligentsia&quot;. The Indian lawyer Abdul Noorani disagrees, and states that the Supreme Court in its 1995 ruling gave &quot;Hindutva a benign meaning, calling Hindutva the same as Indianization, etc.&quot; and these were unnecessary digressions from the facts of the case, and in doing so, the court may have brought down the wall separating religion and politics&quot;.

==History==
===Ideology===
The word Hindutva was already in use by the late 1890s by Chandranath Basu, Basu&#x27;s usage of the word was to merely portray a traditional Hindu cultural view in contrary to the formation of the political ideology by Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. Savarkar, a right-wing nationalist and Indian freedom activist, wrote a book titled &quot;Hindutva: Who is a Hindu?&quot;&quot; in 1922, in which he outlined his ideology and &quot;the idea of a universal and essential Hindu identity&quot;. The term &quot;Hindu identity&quot; is broadly interpreted and distinguished from &quot;ways of life and values of others&quot;. The contemporary meaning and usage of Hindutva largely derives from Savarkar&#x27;s ideas, as does the post-1980s nationalism and mass political activity in India. According to Jaffrelot, Hindutva as outlined in Savarkar&#x27;s writings &quot;perfectly illustrates&quot; an effort at identity-building through the &quot;stigmatisation and emulation of threatening others&quot;. In particular, it was pan-Islamism and similar &quot;Pan-isms&quot; that he assumed made the Hindus vulnerable, as he wrote:

The Hindutva ideology borrowed from European fascism. Parallels between Hindutva and European fascism are observed in the concepts such as repeated mobilisations, appeals to a mythic past, anti-socialism and other concepts. Since Savarkar&#x27;s time, the &quot;Hindu identity&quot; and the associated Hindutva ideology has been built upon the perceived vulnerability of Indian religions, culture and heritage from those who through &quot;orientalist construction&quot; have vilified them as inferior to a non-Indian religion, culture and heritage. In its nationalistic response, Hindutva has been conceived &quot;primarily as an ethnic community&quot; concept, states Jaffrelot, then presented as cultural nationalism, where Hinduism along with other Indian religions are but a part.

According to Arvind Sharma, a scholar of Hinduism, Hindutva has not been a &quot;static and monolithic concept&quot;, rather its meaning and &quot;context, text and subtext has changed over time&quot;. The struggles of the colonial era and the formulation of neo-Hinduism by the early 20th century added a sense of &quot;ethnicity&quot; to the original &quot;Hinduness&quot; meaning of Hindutva. Its early formulation incorporated the racism and nationalism concepts prevalent in Europe during the first half of the 20th century, and culture was in part rationalised as a result of &quot;shared blood and race&quot;. Savarkar and his Hindutva colleagues adopted the social Darwinism theories prevalent by the 1930s. In the post-independence period, states Sharma, the concept has suffered from ambiguity and its understanding aligned on &quot;two different axes&quot; – one of religion versus culture, another of nation versus state. In general, the Hindutva thought among many Indians has &quot;tried to align itself with the culture and nation&quot; axes.

According to Prabhu Bapu, a historian and scholar of Oriental Studies, the term and the contextual meaning of Hindutva emerged from the Indian experience in the colonial era, memories of its religious wars as the Mughal Empire decayed, an era of Muslim and Christian proselytisation, a feeling that their traditions and cultures were being insulted, whereby the Hindu intellectuals formulated Hindutva as a &quot;Hindu identity&quot; as a prelude to a national resurgence and a unified Indian nation against the &quot;foreign invaders&quot;. The development of &quot;religious nationalism&quot; and the demand by the Muslim leaders on the Indian subcontinent for the partition of British India into Muslim and non-Muslim nations (Pakistan and Bangladesh being Muslim-majority, and India being Hindu-majority) during the middle of the 20th century, confirmed its narrative of geographical and cultural nationalism based on Indian culture and religions. Professor Muqtedar Khan has argued that Hindu nationalism further grew because of the religious divisions between Hindus and Muslims that were fomented by post-1947 Pakistani terrorist attacks in and military conflicts with India.

According to Chetan Bhatt, the various forms of Hindu nationalism including the recent &quot;cultural nationalist&quot; form of Hindutva, have roots in the second half of the 19th century. These are a &quot;dense cluster of ideologies&quot; of primordialism, and they emerged from the colonial experiences of the Indian people in conjunction with ideas borrowed from European thinkers but thereafter debated, adapted and negotiated. These ideas included those of a nation, nationalism, race, Aryanism, Orientalism, Romanticism and others. Decades before he wrote his treatise on Hindutva, Savarkar was already famous in colonial India for his version of 1857 &quot;Mutiny&quot; history. He studied in London between 1906 and 1910. There he discussed and evolved his ideas of &quot;what constituted a Hindu identity&quot;, made friends with Indian student groups as well as non-Indian groups such as the Sinn Féin. He was a part of the underground home rule and liberation movement of Indians, before getting arrested for anti-British activities. His political activities and intellectual journeys through the European publications, according to Bhatt, influenced him, his future writings and the 20th-century Hindutva ideology that emerged from his writings.

===Adoption===
Savarkar&#x27;s Hindutva ideology reached Keshav Baliram Hedgewar in Nagpur (Maharashtra) in 1925, and he found Savarkar&#x27;s &quot;Hindutva&quot; inspirational. He visited Savarkar in Ratnagiri shortly after and discussed with him methods for organising the &#x27;Hindu nation&#x27;. Savarkar and Hedgewar discussions led in September that year to Hedgewar starting Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS, lit. &quot;National Volunteer Society&quot;) with this mission. This organisation rapidly grew to become the largest Hindu nationalist movement. However, the term &quot;Hindutva&quot; was not used to describe the ideology of the new organisation; it was &quot;Hindu Rashtra&quot; (Hindu nation), with one RSS publication stating, &quot;it became evident that Hindus were the nation in Bharat and that &quot;Hindutva&quot; was &quot;Rashtriyatva&quot; [nationalism].&quot;

Hedgewar&#x27;s RSS not only propagated Hindutva ideology, it developed a grassroots organizational structure (&quot;shakhas&quot;) to reform the Hindu society. Village level groups met for morning and evening physical training sessions, martial training and Hindutva ideology lessons. Hedgewar kept RSS an ideologically active but an &quot;apolitical&quot; organisation. This practice of keeping out of national and international politics was retained by his successor M. S. Golwalkar through the 1940s. Philosopher Jason Stanley states &quot;the RSS was explicitly influenced by European fascist movements, its leading politicians regularly praised Hitler and Mussolini in the late 1930s and 1940s.&quot; In 1931, B. S. Moonje met with Mussolini and expressed a desire to replicate the fascist youth movement in India. According to Sali Augustine, the core institution of Hindutva has been the RSS. While the RSS states that Hindutva is different from Hinduism, it has been linked to religion. Therefore &quot;cultural nationalism&quot; is a euphemism, states Augustine, and it is meant to mask the creation of a state with a &quot;Hindu religious identity&quot;. According to Jaffrelot, the regional heads of the RSS have included Indians who are Hindus as well as those who belong to other Indian religions such as Jainism.

In parallel to the RSS, Savarkar, after his release from the colonial prison, joined and became the president of Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha in 1937. There, he used the terms &quot;Hindutva&quot; and &quot;Hindu Rashtra&quot; liberally, according to Graham. Syama Prasad Mukherjee, who served as its president in 1944 and joined the Jawaharlal Nehru Cabinet after independence, was a Hindu traditionalist politician who wanted to uphold Hindu values but not necessarily to the exclusion of other communities. He asked for the membership of Hindu Mahasabha to be thrown open to all communities. When this was not accepted, he resigned from the party and founded a new political party in collaboration with the RSS. He understood Hinduism as a nationality rather than a community but, realising that this is not the common understanding of the term &quot;Hindu&quot;, he chose &quot;Bharatiya&quot; instead of &quot;Hindu&quot; to name the new party, which came to be called the Bharatiya Jana Sangh.

===Growth===
The cabinet of the first prime minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru banned the RSS and arrested more than 200,000 RSS volunteers, after Nathuram Godse, a former volunteer of RSS, assassinated Mahatma Gandhi. Nehru also appointed government commissions to investigate the assassination and related circumstances. The series of investigations by these commissions, states the political science scholar Nandini Deo, later found the RSS leadership and &quot;the RSS innocent of a role in the assassination&quot;. The mass arrested RSS volunteers were released by the Indian courts, and the RSS has ever since used this as evidence of &quot;being falsely accused and condemned&quot;.

According to the historian Robert Frykenberg specialising in South Asian Studies, the RSS membership enormously expanded in independent India. In this period, while RSS remained &quot;discretely out of politics&quot;, Jan Sangh, another Hindutva-ideology-based organisation, entered the political arena. The Jan Sangh had limited success in the Indian general elections between 1952 and 1971. This was, in part, because of its poor organisation and leadership; its focus on the Hindutva sentiment did not appeal to the voters, and its campaign lacked adequate social and economic themes. This was also, in part, because Congress party leaders such Indira Gandhi had co-opted some of the key Hindutva ideology themes and fused it with socialist policies and her father&#x27;s Jawaharlal Nehru Soviet-style centrally controlled economic model. The RSS continued its grassroots operations between 1947 and early 1970s, and its volunteers provided humanitarian assistance to Hindu and Sikh refugees from the partition of British India, victims of war and violence, and helped disaster victims to resettle economically.

Between 1975 and 1977, Indira Gandhi declared and enforced Emergency with press censorship, the arrests of opposition leaders, and the suspension of many fundamental human rights of Indian citizens. The abuses of Emergency triggered a mass resistance and the rapid growth of volunteers and political support to the Hindutva ideology. Indira Gandhi and her party were voted out of power in 1977. The Hindutva ideology-based Jan Sangh members such as Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Brij Lal Varma, and L. K. Advani gained national prominence, and the Hindutva ideology sympathiser Morarji Desai became the prime minister of a coalition non-Congress government. This coalition did not last past 1980, and from the consequent break-up of coalition parties was the founding of the Bharatiya Janata Party in April 1980. This new national political party relied on the Hindutva ideology-based rural and urban grassroots organisations that had rapidly grown across India from the mid-1970s.

===Hindutva under Modi (2014–present)===

Since the 2014 Indian general election with the BJP winning, the premiership of Narendra Modi and state based BJP governments have pushed parts of the Hindutva agenda.

====Abrogation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir====
On 5 August 2019, the Modi administration revoked the special status, or limited autonomy, granted under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir. The Supreme Court has however upheld the abrogation of article 370 as part of an exercise to integrate Jammu and Kashmir with the rest of the country.

====Ayodhya dispute====
On 9 November 2019, the Supreme Court of India passed a verdict on creation of Ram Mandir on the disputed land of Ayodhya. The verdict also stated to provide for creation of a mosque on another alternative site which was given to the Sunni Waqf Board. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) report which had stated that remains of a &quot;Hindu structure&quot; were found at the disputed Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi site was one of the evidences used for such a verdict. On 5 August 2019, Narendra Modi held the Bhoomipujan at the Ayodhya. He became the first prime minister to visit Ram Janmabhoomi and Hanuman Garhi. On 22 January 2024, the Ram Mandir was completed and inaugurated by Prime Minister Modi. In a speech he said, &quot;Ram is the faith of India, Ram is the foundation of India, Ram is the idea of India, Ram is the law of India. Ram is the prestige of India, Ram is the glory of India...Ram is the leader and Ram is the policy.&quot;

====Forced conversion bans====

Many BJP-ruled states, such as Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Karnataka, have considered laws designed to prevent forced conversions from Hinduism to Islam through marriage. Hindutva advocates call this &quot;love jihad&quot;, and it is widely considered to be an Islamophobic conspiracy theory. In September 2020, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath asked his government to come up with a strategy to prevent &quot;religious conversions in the name of love&quot;. On 31 October, he announced that a law to curb &quot;love jihad&quot; would be passed by his government. The law, which also includes provisions against &quot;unlawful religious conversion&quot;, declares a marriage null and void if the sole intention was to &quot;change a girl&#x27;s religion&quot; and both it and the one in Madhya Pradesh imposed sentences of up to 10 years in prison for those who broke the law. The ordinance came into effect on 28 November 2020 as the Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance. In December 2020, Madhya Pradesh approved an anti-conversion law similar to the Uttar Pradesh one. , Haryana and Karnataka were still in discussion over similar ordinances. In April 2021, the Gujarat Assembly amended the Freedom of Religion Act, 2003, bringing in stringent provisions against forcible conversion through marriage or allurement, with the intention of targeting &quot;love jihad&quot;. The Karnataka state cabinet also approved an anti-conversion bill, making it a law in December 2021. This law was revoked by the new Government of Karnataka.

== Vishva Hindu Parishad and Bharatiya Janata Party ==
The RSS established a number of affiliate organisations after Indian Independence to carry its ideology to various parts of the society. Prominent among them is the Vishva Hindu Parishad, which was set up in 1964 with the objective of protecting and promoting the Hindu religion. It subscribed to &quot;Hindutva&quot; ideology, which came to mean in its hands political Hinduism and Hindu militancy.

A number of political developments in the 1980s caused a sense of vulnerability among the Hindus in India. This was much discussed and leveraged by the Hindutva ideology organisations. These developments include the mass killing of the Hindus by the militant Khalistan movement, the influx of undocumented Bangladeshi immigration into Assam coupled with the expulsion of Hindus from Bangladesh, the Congress-led government&#x27;s pro-Muslim bias in the Shah Bano case as well as the Rushdie affair. The VHP and the BJP utilised these developments to push forward a militant Hindutva nationalist agenda leading to the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. The BJP officially adopted Hindutva as its ideology in its 1989 Palampur resolution.

The BJP claims that &quot;Hindutva&quot; represents &quot;cultural nationalism&quot; and its conception of &quot;Indian nationhood&quot;, but not a religious or theocratic concept. It is &quot;India&#x27;s identity&quot;, according to the RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat.

According to the anthropologist and South Asia Politics scholar Thomas Hansen, Hindutva in the post-Independence era has emerged as a political ideology and a populist form of Hindu nationalism. For Indian nationalists, it has subsumed &quot;religious sentiments and public rituals into a larger discourse of national culture (Bharatiya culture) and the Hindu nation, Hindu rashtra&quot;, states Hansen. This notion has appealed to the masses in part because it &quot;connects meaningfully with everyday anxieties of security, a sense of disorder&quot; in modern Indian life. The BJP has deployed the Hindutva theme in its election campaign since early 1991, as well as nominated candidates who are affiliated with organisations that support the Hindutva ideology. The campaign language of the Congress Party leader Rajiv Gandhi in the 1980s mirrored those of Hindutva proponents. The political speeches and publications by Indian Muslim leaders have declared their &quot;Islamic religious identity&quot; being greater than any &quot;political ideology or national identity&quot;. These developments, states Hansen, have helped Hindu nationalists spread essentialist constructions per contemporary Hindutva ideology.

==Concepts and issues==
===Uniform Civil Code===
The Hindutva leaders have sought a Uniform Civil Code for all the citizens of India, where the same law applies to all its citizens irrespective of the individual&#x27;s religion. They state that differential laws based on religion violate the Indian Constitution and have sowed the seeds of divisiveness between different religious communities. Under the current laws that were enacted in 1955–56, state John Hutchinson and Anthony D. Smith, the constitutionally directive principle of a Uniform Civil Code covers only non-Muslims. The Uniform Civil Code is opposed by the Muslim leaders. A Uniform Civil Code that applies equally to the Muslims in India is also opposed by political parties such as the Indian National Congress and the Communist Party.

===Protection of Hindu interests===

The followers of Hindutva are known for their criticism of the Indian government as too passive with regard to the exodus of Kashmiri Hindus by Kashmiri Muslim separatists and the 1998 Wandhama massacre, and advocates of Hindutva wish a harder stance in Jammu and Kashmir. The supporters of Hindutva sought to protect the native Hindu culture and traditions especially those that symbolised the Hindu culture. They believe that Indian culture is identical with the Hindu culture. These include animals, language, holy structures, rivers and medicine.

They opposed the continuation of Urdu being used as a vernacular language as they associated it with Muslims. They felt that Urdu symbolised a foreign culture. For them, Hindi alone was the unifying factor for all the diverse forces in the country. They even wanted to make Hindi as the official language of India and felt that it should be promoted at the expense of English and the other regional languages, with some Hindutva followers describing this with the slogan &quot;Hindi-Hindu-Hindustan&quot;. However, this caused a state of tension and alarm in the non-Hindi regions. The non-Hindi regions saw it as an attempt by the north to dominate the rest of the country. Eventually, this demand was put down in order to protect the cultural diversity of the country.

Hindutva activists have boycotted several Bollywood movies in recent years, claiming that they use too much Urdu and are anti-Hindu; some activists have called for South Indian cinema to be patronised instead, claiming that it is more culturally rooted. Hindutva opposition to Urdu coincides with a desire to spread a Sanskritised Hindi across India.

==Organisations==
Hindutva is the guiding ideology of the RSS and its affiliated family of organisations, the Sangh Parivar. In general, &quot;Hindutvavadis&quot; (followers of Hindutva) believe that they represent the well-being of Dharmic religions: Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, and Jainism.

Most nationalists are organised into political, cultural and social organisations using the concept of Hindutva as a political tool. The first Hindutva organisation formed was the RSS, founded in 1925. A prominent Indian political party, the BJP, is closely associated with a group of organisations that advocate Hindutva. They collectively refer to themselves as the &quot;Sangh Parivar&quot; or family of associations, and include the RSS, Bajrang Dal and the VHP. Other organisations include:
* Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh, the overseas branch of the RSS
* Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a workers&#x27; union
* Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, a students&#x27; union
* Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, a farmers&#x27; organisation

Political parties that are independent from the Sangh Parivar&#x27;s influence but that also espouse the Hindutva ideology include the Hindu Mahasabha, Prafull Goradia&#x27;s Akhil Bharatiya Jana Sangh, and the Marathi nationalist Shiv Sena, Shiv Sena (UBT) and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is a Sikh religious party that maintained ties with Hindutva organisations and political parties, as they also represent Sikhism. By September 2020, SAD left the NDA over the farms bill.

==Hindutva violence==

Since the mid-2010s, there has been a notable increase in violence motivated by Hindutva ideology, particularly towards Muslims, and includes acts of extremist terroristic violence. This has principally been perpetrated by or has implicated members, or alleged members, of Hindu nationalist organizations such as the RSS or Abhinav Bharat. The violence has also been condoned by the BJP politicians and used as an electoral strategy to garner support from the far-right Hindu population. The veneration of cows as deities and restrictions on meat consumption have also been used by to justify violence against Muslims, Christians, Dalits, and lower-caste Hindus.

===Cow vigilantism===

There has been a rise in the number of incidents of cow vigilantism since the election of a BJP majority in the Parliament of India in 2014. The frequency and severity of cow vigilante violence has been described as &quot;unprecedented&quot;. Human Rights Watch has reported that there has been a surge in such violence since 2015. The surge is attributed to the recent rise in Hindu nationalism in India. Many vigilante groups say they feel &quot;empowered&quot; by the victory of the Hindu nationalist BJP in the 2014 election.

According to a Reuters report, there were 63 attacks in India between 2010 and mid 2017 resulting in 28 deaths, 24 of them Muslim, and 124 injuries. Most attacks occurred after Narendra Modi took office in 2014.

Many BJP states have passed laws against cattle slaughter such as Gujarat. On 6 June 2017, Uttar Pradesh&#x27;s Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath directed the state police to take action against cow slaughter and cattle smuggling under the National Security Act and the Gangster Act, and in (2021) Assam Assembly passed a bill that prohibits the slaughter or sale of beef within a radius of any temple. The legislation seeks to ensure that permission for slaughter is not granted to areas that are predominantly inhabited by Hindu, Jain, Sikh and other non-beef eating communities or places that fall within a radius of a temple, satra and any other institution as may be prescribed by the authorities. Exemptions, however, might be granted for certain religious occasions.

==Criticism and apologetics==
===Similarities with fascism and Nazism===

&lt;section begin=&quot;fascism&quot; /&gt;The Hindutva ideology of organisations such as RSS have long been compared to fascism or Nazism. An editorial published on 4 February 1948, for example, in the &quot;National Herald&quot;, the mouthpiece of the Indian National Congress party, stated that &quot;it [RSS] seems to embody Hinduism in a Nazi form&quot; with the recommendation that it must be ended. Similarly, in 1956, another Congress party leader compared Jana Sangh to the Nazis in Germany. After the 1940s and 1950s, a number of scholars have labelled or compared Hindutva to fascism. Marzia Casolari has linked the association and the borrowing of pre-World War II European nationalist ideas by early leaders of Hindutva ideology. According to the &quot;Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics and International Relations&quot;, the term Hindutva has &quot;fascist undertones&quot;. Many scholars have pointed out that early Hindutva ideologues were inspired by fascist movements in early 20th-century Italy and Germany.

The Indian Marxist economist and political commentator Prabhat Patnaik calls Hindutva &quot;almost fascist in the classical sense&quot;. He states that the Hindutva movement is based on &quot;class support, methods and programme&quot;. According to Patnaik, Hindutva has the following fascist ingredients: &quot;an attempt to create a unified homogeneous majority under the concept of &quot;the Hindus&quot;; a sense of grievance against past injustice; a sense of cultural superiority; an interpretation of history according to this grievance and superiority; a rejection of rational arguments against this interpretation; and an appeal to the majority based on race and masculinity&quot;.

According to some opinion writers, Hindutva shows ethno-nationalism and hyper-militarism similar to Revisionist Zionism and Kahanism.&lt;section end=&quot;fascism&quot; /&gt;

According to Jaffrelot, the early Hindutva proponents such as Golwalkar envisioned it as an extreme form of &quot;ethnic nationalism&quot;, but the ideology differed from fascism and Nazism in three respects. First, unlike fascism and Nazism, it did not closely associate Hindutva with its leader. Second, while fascism emphasised the primacy of the state, Hindutva considered the state to be a secondary. Third, while Nazism emphasised primacy of the race, the Hindutva ideology emphasised primacy of the society over race. According to Achin Vanaik, several authors have labelled Hindutva as fascist, but such a label requires &quot;establishing a fascist minimum&quot;. Hindu nationalism, states Vanaik, is &quot;a specific Indian manifestation of a generic phenomenon [of nationalism] but not one that belongs to the genus of fascism&quot;.

According to Mark Juergensmeyer, a number of writers in India and outside India have variously described Hindutva as &quot;fundamentalist&quot; and &quot;India&#x27;s flirtation with native fascism&quot;, while others disagree. The debate on Hindutva is a matter of perspective. The Indians debate it from the perspective of their own colonial past and their contemporary issues, while the Euro-American view considers it from the global issues, their own experiences with fundamentalism in light of classic liberal and relativist positions, states Juergensmeyer.

Sociologists Chetan Bhatt and Parita Mukta have described difficulties in identifying Hindutva with fascism or Nazism, because of Hindutva&#x27;s embrace of cultural rather than racial nationalism, its &quot;distinctively Indian&quot; character, and &quot;the RSS&#x27;s disavowal of the seizure of state power in preference for long-term cultural labour in civil society&quot;. They describe Hindutva as a form of &quot;revolutionary conservatism&quot; or &quot;ethnic absolutism&quot;. According to Thomas Hansen, Hindutva represents a &quot;conservative revolution&quot; in postcolonial India, and its proponents have been combining &quot;paternalistic and xenophobic discourses&quot; with &quot;democratic and universalist discourses on rights and entitlements&quot; based on &quot;desires, anxieties and fractured subjectivities&quot; in India.

=== Upper casteism ===
When Prime Minister V. P. Singh launched the Mandal Commission to broaden reservations in government and public university jobs to a significant portion of the Shudras who were officially branded the Other Backward Classes (OBC), the mouthpiece of the Hindutva organisation RSS, &quot;Organiser&quot; magazine, wrote of &quot;an urgent need to build up moral and spiritual forces to counter any fallout from an expected Shudra revolution&quot;.

According to social scientist and economist Jean Drèze, the Mandal Commission angered the upper castes and threatened to distance the OBCs, but the Babri Masjid&#x27;s destruction and ensuing events helped to reduce this challenge and reunified Hindus on an anti-Muslim stance. He further claims &quot;The Hindutva project is a lifeboat for the upper castes in so far as it promises to restore the Brahminical social order&quot; and the potential enemies of this ideology is anybody whose acts or might hinder the process of restoring the Brahminic social order. Drèze further claims that although Hindutva is known as a majoritarian movement, it can be best expressed as an oppressive minority movement.

According to Jaffrelot, the Sangh Parivar organisations with their Hindutva ideology have strived to impose the belief structure of the upper caste Hindus. According to Dalit rights activist and political theorist Kancha Ilaiah, &quot;Hindutva Is Nothing But Brahminism&quot; and that only &quot;Dalitisation can effectively counter the danger of Brahminical fascism disguised as Hindutva&quot;.

According to sociologist Amritorupa Sen, the privileges of the upper caste and especially Brahmins have become invisible. There has been a cultural norm that Brahmins take care of the lower castes out of a moral responsibility but also out of human kindness.

===Ahistorical premises, separatism===

According to Jaffrelot, the Hindutva ideology has roots in an era where the fiction in ancient Indian mythology and Vedic antiquity was presumed to be valid. This fiction was used to &quot;give sustenance to Hindu ethnic consciousness&quot;. Its strategy emulated the Muslim identity politics of the Khilafat movement after World War I, and borrowed political concepts from the West – mainly German. Hindutva organizations treat events in Hindu mythology as history. Hindutva organizations have been criticized for their belief in statements or practices that they claim to be both scientific and factual but are incompatible with the scientific method.

Hindutva ideology is also described to be separatist in its form. Siddharth Varadarajan writes that Hindutva separatism seeks to depart from the &quot;philosophical, cultural and civilization mores of the country, including Hinduism itself&quot;.

According to Anthony Parel, a historian and political scientist, Savarkar&#x27;s &quot;Hindutva, Who is a Hindu?&quot; published in 1923 is a fundamental text of Hindutva ideology. It asserts, states Parel, India of the past to be &quot;the creation of a racially superior people, the Aryans. They came to be known to the outside world as Hindus, the people beyond the Indus River. Their identity was created by their race (jati) and their culture (sanskriti). All Hindus claim to have in their veins the blood of the mighty race incorporated with and descended from the Vedic fathers. They created a culture – an ensemble of mythologies, legends, epic stories, philosophy, art and architecture, laws and rites, feasts and festivals. They have a special relationship to India: India is to them both a fatherland and a holy land.&quot; The Savarkar&#x27;s text presents the &quot;Hindu culture as a self-sufficient culture, not needing any input from other cultures&quot;, which is &quot;an unhistorical, narcissistic and false account of India&#x27;s past&quot;, states Parel.

The premises of early Hindu nationalist thought, states Chetan Bhatt, reflected the colonial era European scholarship and Orientalism of its times. The idea of &quot;India as the cradle of civilization&quot; (Voltaire, Herder, Kant, Schlegel), or as &quot;humanity&#x27;s homeland and primal philosophy&quot; (Herder, Schlegel), or the &quot;humanism in Hindu values&quot; (Herder), or of Hinduism offering redemption for contemporary humanity (Schopenhauer), along with the colonial era scholarship of Frederich Muller, Charles Wilkins, William Jones, Alexander Hamilton and others were the natural intellectual matrix for Savarkar and others to borrow and germinate their Hindu nationalist ideas.

Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad, a Fellow of the British Academy and a scholar of Politics and Philosophy of Religion, states that Hindutva is a form of nationalism that is expounded differently by its opponents and its proponents. The opponents of Hindutva either consider it as a fundamentalist ideology that &quot;aims to regulate the working of civil society with the imperatives of Hindu religious doctrine&quot;, or alternatively, as another form of fundamentalism while accepting that Hinduism is a diverse collection of doctrines, is complex and is different from other religions. According to Ram-Prasad, the proponents reject these tags, viewing it to be their right and a desirable value to cherish their religious and cultural traditions. The Hindutva ideology according to Savarkar, states Ram-Prasad, is a &quot;geography, race, and culture&quot; based concept. However, the &quot;geography&quot; is not strictly territorial but is an &quot;ancestral homeland of a people&quot;, and the &quot;race&quot; is not biogenetic but described as the historic descendants of the intermarriage of Aryans, native inhabitants and &quot;different peoples&quot; who arrived over time. So, &quot;the ultimate category for Hindutva is culture&quot;, and this culture is &quot;not strictly speaking religious, if by religion is meant a commitment to certain doctrines of transcendence&quot;, he states. The proponents state that in the Hindutva thought, there is a kernel of coherent and justifiable thesis about the Indian culture and history.

=== Threats to academic freedom ===
Hindutva ideology has been linked to threats to academics and students, both in India and the United States. For instance, in 2011, Hindutva activists successfully led a charge to remove an essay about the multiple narratives of Ramayanas from Delhi University&#x27;s history syllabus. Romila Thapar, one of India&#x27;s most eminent historians, has faced repeated Hindutva-led attacks. The Hindu right has been responsible for pushback against scholars of South Asia and Hinduism based in North America, including Wendy Doniger and Sheldon Pollock; Doniger&#x27;s book was no longer printed after its publisher settled a lawsuit claiming that it defamed Hinduism and Pollock was accused of misrepresenting India&#x27;s cultural heritage and that he had &quot;shown disrespect for the unity and integrity of India&quot;. Under BJP leadership, the Indian state has been accused of monitoring scholars and denying some research access. Audrey Truschke is one such example who remains frequent target of their threats.

In 2021, a group of North American-based scholars of South Asia formed a collective and published the Hindutva Harassment Field Manual to, they argue, answer the Hindutva threat to their academic freedom. They documented further incidents of Hindutva harassment of academics in North America, dating back to the 1990s. The Association for Asian Studies noted that Hindutva, described as a &quot;majoritarian ideological doctrine&quot; different from Hinduism, resorted to &quot;increasing attacks on numerous scholars, artists and journalists who critically analyze its politics&quot;. A number of scholars and participants withdrew from the conference following the threats they received from ultranationalists and Hindutva supporters.

== Hindutva pop ==

Hindutva pop is a subgenre of Indian pop promoting Hindutva ideas. It openly calls for violence against many non-Hindu minorities, especially Muslims. Hindutva pop artists defend their music as neither xenophobic nor Islamophobic, arguing it promotes truth. Popular Hindutva pop artists like Laxmi Dubey and Prem Krishnavanshi mainstream the xenophobic values of the genre.

<text>Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) is a public university located in East Anglia, United Kingdom. Its origins trace back to the Cambridge School of Art (CSA), founded by William John Beamont, a Fellow of Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, in 1858. The institution became a university in 1992 and was renamed after John Ruskin, the Oxford University professor and author, in 2005. Ruskin delivered the inaugural speech at the Cambridge School of Art in 1858. ARU is classified as one of the &quot;post-1992 universities.&quot; The university&#x27;s motto is in Latin: &quot;Excellentia per societatem&quot;, which translates to &quot;Excellence through partnership&quot; in English.

, Anglia Ruskin had 35,195 students. ARU has six campuses across the south-eastern portion of the United Kingdom in Cambridgeshire, Essex, and Greater London.

==History==

Anglia Ruskin University has its origins in the Cambridge School of Art, founded by William John Beamont in 1858. The inaugural address was given by John Ruskin, who is often incorrectly described as the founder. The original location was near Sidney Sussex College, but it later moved to its current location on East Road, Cambridge.

In the 1920s, the governing body included two remarkable pioneers in the civic history of Cambridge: Clara Rackham and Lilian Mellish Clarke, after whom buildings on the East Road campus were later named. In 1960, this institution became the Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology (CCAT). In 1989, CCAT merged with the Essex Institute of Higher Education, which was originally a vocational school named Chelmsford School of Science and Art and later known as Mid Essex Technical College and Chelmer Institute of Higher Education, to form Anglia Higher Education College.

The merged college became a polytechnic in 1991, adopting the name Anglia Polytechnic, and was awarded university status in 1992. Initially called Anglia Polytechnic University (APU), it retained the term &#x27;polytechnic&#x27; in its title because it symbolized the type of education known for equipping students with practical skills for the workforce. However, in 2000 there was some uncertainty about including &#x27;polytechnic&#x27; in the title since it was the only university in the country to do so. Wanting to keep the &#x27;APU&#x27; abbreviation, a suggestion put forward by the governors was &#x27;Anglia Prior University&#x27; (after a former Chancellor Jim Prior), but the Governors decided to keep &#x27;polytechnic&#x27; in the title.

The university eventually reconsidered a name change and chose Anglia Ruskin University, incorporating John Ruskin&#x27;s surname into the title. This change took effect following approval from the Privy Council on 29 September 2005.

In 2007 ARU entered into partnership with London College of Accountancy (LCA; founded in 2000). This resulted in the creation of ARU London. 

In October 2023, Anglia Ruskin University became the first university in the United Kingdom to sign UNISON&#x27;s Anti-Racism Charter.

In 2024, Writtle University College merged with Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), becoming ARU Writtle.

Former students include the Victorian poet Augusta Webster, who signed John Stuart Mill&#x27;s petition for women&#x27;s suffrage in 1866. Past lecturers include Odile Crick, the wife of Francis Crick, who created the iconic image of DNA. The musician Syd Barrett, songwriter and lead guitarist of the band Pink Floyd, is also an alumnus. Author Tom Sharpe served as a lecturer in history at CCAT from 1963 to 1972, and Anne Campbell, the Labour MP for Cambridge from 1992 to 2005, was previously a lecturer in statistics at CCAT.

=== Controversies ===

In a BBC News article from 3 June 2014, it was reported that Anglia Ruskin University received more complaints and appeals from its students than any of the other 120 universities that responded to freedom of information requests. In the 2012/13 academic year, the university received 992 &quot;complaints and appeals.&quot; In response, Lesley Dobree, Deputy Vice Chancellor (Academic), stated that only 9 of the 992 recorded complaints were actual complaints; the others were protests regarding examination and assignment marking.

==== Pok Wong ====
In 2019, Hongkonger Pok Wong, a 2014 graduate of Anglia Ruskin University, received a £61,000 out-of-court settlement from the university after suing for false advertising, alleging a low quality of teaching. The university has maintained that the payout does not indicate fault on its part. In 2018, the London County Court ruled in favor of the university and ordered Wong to pay £13,700 of Anglia Ruskin&#x27;s legal costs. However, the university&#x27;s insurers later contacted Wong and offered to settle her £15,000 claim while covering her legal costs. Anglia Ruskin added that it did not support the decision made by its insurer&#x27;s solicitors.

==== Retracting Junius Ho&#x27;s honorary award ====
Anglia Ruskin University awarded Junius Ho, a pro-Beijing lawmaker in Hong Kong, an Honorary Doctor of Laws in 2011. During the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, Ho was accused of supporting those who committed the 2019 Yuen Long attack. In response to Ho&#x27;s controversial speech, David Alton wrote to the university regarding the matter. Lord Alton urged the university to revoke Ho&#x27;s honorary doctoral degree. The university confirmed that Ho was stripped of his degree on 29 October 2019.

==Campuses==
The university has campuses in Cambridge, Chelmsford, Writtle, Peterborough, and London.

=== Cambridge ===

Anglia Ruskin University&#x27;s Cambridge campus is located between the historic city center of Cambridge and the suburb of Romsey Town. The campus features a blend of modern facilities and historical architecture, including the original building of the Cambridge School of Art.

The Cambridge campus underwent significant redevelopment, beginning with the refurbishment of the main building, Helmore, which was named after Roy Helmore, the principal of the Cambridge College of Arts and Technology from 1977 to 1986. This renovation was completed in 2006. In 2009, one of the university&#x27;s largest buildings, Rackham, located in the campus center, was demolished to make way for the new Lord Ashcroft International Business School. The new business school was inaugurated in 2011. The Mumford Theatre, situated at the heart of the campus, continues to host a diverse range of professional touring, local community, and student theatre productions for both the public and university members.

From 2015, a new building known as Young Street (named for its location between Young Street and New Street) began hosting nursing and health courses, including midwifery, paramedic studies, and operating department practice (ODP). This building is also home to the university&#x27;s Music Therapy Centre.

As of 2015, all sports, computing, and technology courses were relocated to the newly established Compass House building, which is situated approximately 0.3 miles (0.5 km) along East Road from the main campus.

Anglia Ruskin&#x27;s Cambridge Campus is home to one of only nine optometry schools in the UK, featuring its own optometry clinic.
==== Ruskin Gallery ====
The Ruskin Gallery is the university&#x27;s public art gallery, and admission is free. Exhibits have included both historic and contemporary art, as well as works by students and staff. The gallery is surrounded by studios for fine art, illustration, design, and media. On 9 May 2011, the Ruskin Gallery unveiled its new digital gallery, which displays art in a digital format on high-definition screens, including the world&#x27;s first Panasonic 103&quot; 3D Full HD plasma screen.

=== Chelmsford ===
Anglia Ruskin University&#x27;s Chelmsford campus is situated in the city&#x27;s University and Innovation Quarter, along the river. The campus features modern buildings that house facilities including Essex&#x27;s first School of Medicine, which opened in 2019.

The Chelmsford campus houses several notable buildings, including the Queen&#x27;s Building (opened in 1995) and the Sawyer&#x27;s Building (opened in 2001). Queen Elizabeth II inaugurated the Queen&#x27;s Building.

In 2003, Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, opened the Michael A. Ashcroft Building, which was later renamed the Lord Ashcroft Building.

The Chelmsford Central campus closed at the end of the 2007/08 academic year, with all facilities moving to the new buildings at the Rivermead campus (now called Chelmsford Campus) on Bishop Hall Lane.

Three buildings were preserved: the East Building (built in 1931), the Frederick Chancellor Building (built in 1902), and the Grade II-listed Anne Knight Building (constructed in the mid-19th century), which was used by Quakers. The East and Frederick Chancellor buildings are located within a conservation area, meaning they cannot be demolished without planning permission due to their historical significance in the early days of higher education in Essex. The site is currently vacant because the recession halted development that had been planned for many years; however, new plans have been released by Genesis Housing, which currently owns the site.

The campus expanded further with the addition of the Mildmay Sports Centre and the Tindal Building in 2005, followed by the William Harvey Building in 2007. The Faculty Building, opened in 2008, was renamed the Marconi Building in 2011.

The Postgraduate Medical Institute building, opened in 2011, was later named the Michael Salmon Building in 2017.

Construction of Essex&#x27;s first School of Medicine began in May 2017, and the facility was officially opened in 2019 by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent.
=== London ===
ARU London has two locations. The Farringdon Building is situated on Charterhouse Street in Holborn, which borders the City of London. The East India Building is located in the former East India Docks, adjacent to Canary Wharf in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.

The Farringdon Building is located in the heart of central London, near the city&#x27;s business and financial district. This campus has facilities, including lecture theatres, seminar rooms, PC-equipped study areas, and a library.

The East India Building is situated in the Docklands area of East London, having undergone a significant refurbishment. It offers teaching spaces and communal work areas spread over four floors. Both campuses provide a range of undergraduate and postgraduate programs in subjects such as business, law, and finance.

=== Peterborough ===

Anglia Ruskin University Peterborough campus, which opened in September 2022, is a purpose-built institution located close to the city center of Peterborough. The campus features a simulated hospital ward, science laboratories, and engineering labs.

On 14 July 2020, the Minister of State for Universities, Michelle Donelan, announced Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) as the official higher education partner for a new employment-focused university in Peterborough. This initiative is a collaboration between the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority (CPCA) and Peterborough City Council (PCC). The campus will also include a materials and manufacturing research and development center operated by 3D printing specialists Photocentric, who have partnered with the CPCA to create the facility on the new Peterborough university campus.

ARU Peterborough opened in 2022, with University House being the first building on the campus. The Peterborough Research &amp; Innovation Centre opened in 2024. In the same year, XRP eXtended Reality Peterborough was inaugurated by writer Sandi Toksvig OBE. The second teaching building, which includes specialized facilities for biomedical sciences and engineering, as well as a Living Lab, was completed in August 2024.

=== Writtle ===

Anglia Ruskin University Writtle campus, located in the Essex countryside near Chelmsford, is an educational facility that specialises in land-based, animal sciences, and sport-related programs. The campus spans 150 hectares and features a variety of facilities, including a working farm, equine center, science laboratories, and design studios.

ARU Writtle offers postgraduate, undergraduate, further education, and short courses in agriculture and animal sciences, with a working farm, a specialist small animal unit, and an equine centre on campus. The institution has also developed a range of degree programmes in applied life sciences, sport, and health subjects. Students have been recognized multiple times by the Royal Horticultural Society, including awards at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show in London.

In 2023, Anglia Ruskin University and Writtle University College announced a merger. Writtle University College would become ARU Writtle. The official merger took place on 29 February 2024.

=== Student Housing ===
The Cambridge campus features several accommodations, including Anastasia House, Peter Taylor House, Swinhoe House Hall of Residence, the Railyard, Sedley Court, CB1, and various university houses located throughout the city.

The Chelmsford campus features the Chelmsford Student Village.

<doc id="96938" wikidata="Q858754" url="?curid=96938" title="Anhur">
<text>In early Egyptian mythology, Anhur (also spelled Onuris, Onouris, An-Her, Anhuret, Han-Her, Inhert) was a god of war who was worshipped in the Egyptian area of Abydos, and particularly in Thinis. Myths told that he had brought his wife, Mehit, who was his female counterpart, from Nubia, and his name reflects this—it means &#x27;(one who) leads back the distant one&#x27;.

One of his titles was &quot;slayer of enemies&quot;. Anhur was depicted as a bearded man wearing a robe and a headdress with four feathers, holding a spear or lance, or occasionally as a lion-headed god (representing strength and power). In some depictions, the robe was more similar to a kilt.

==Roles==
===God of war===

Due to his position as a war god, he was patron of the ancient Egyptian army, and the personification of royal warriors. Indeed, at festivals honoring him, mock battles were staged. During the Roman era the Emperor Tiberius was depicted on the walls of Egyptian temples wearing the distinctive four-plumed crown of Anhur.

The Greeks equated Anhur to their god of war, Ares. In the legend of Olympian gods fleeing from Typhon and taking animal form in Egypt, Ares was said to have taken the form of a fish as Lepidotus or Onuris.

===Sky bearer===
Anhur&#x27;s name also could mean &#x27;sky bearer&#x27; and, due to the shared headdress, Anhur was later identified with Shu, becoming &quot;Anhur-Shu&quot;. He is the son of Ra and brother of Tefnut if identified as Shu.

==High priests of Anhur==
* Amenhotep, from the time of Thutmose IV. Amenhotep&#x27;s wife Henut was a singer of Anhur. Their sons Hat and Kenna were Chariot Warriors of His Majesty. Known from a stela now in the British Museum (EA 902).
* Nebwenenef High Priest of Anhur during the reign of Seti I. Was appointed High Priest of Amun in the beginning of the reign of Ramesses II.
* Hori
* Minmose, son of the High Priest of Anhur Hori and his wife Inty. From the reign of Ramesses II.
* Anhurmose, from the time of Merneptah.
* Sishepset, from the time of Ramesses III
* Harsiese, mentioned on an ostracon in Abydos

==In popular culture==
Anhur is a playable character in the multiplayer online battle arena, &quot;SMITE&quot;. Anhur is a Hunter wielding a spear and bears the title the Slayer of Enemies and is shown in his (anthropomorphic) lion form maintaining his beard, robe, and a crown incorporating four large feathers.

Anhur is a chaotic god in the computer game &quot;NetHack&quot;/&quot;Slash&#x27;EM&quot;.

Onuris has a minor role in the 2012 fantasy novel &quot;The Serpent&#x27;s Shadow&quot; as a presumed dead god who is revived in order to destroy the Lord of Chaos, Apophis.

Anhur is one of the 20 bosses you fight in the video game Boss Rush: Mythology.

The American death metal band Nile did two tracks about Anhur in their 2000 album Black Seeds of Vengeance, called &quot;Masturbating the War God&quot; and &quot;Libation Unto the Shades Who Lurk In the Shadows of the Temple of Anhur&quot;.

<text>Weld County is a county located in the U.S. state of Colorado. As of the 2020 census, the population was 328,981. The county seat is Greeley. Weld County comprises the Greeley, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Denver–Aurora, CO Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
On May 30, 1854, the Kansas–Nebraska Act created the Nebraska Territory and the Kansas Territory, divided by the Parallel 40° North (Baseline Road or County Line Road or Weld County Road 2 in the future Weld County). Present-day Weld County, Colorado, lay in the southwestern portion of the Nebraska Territory, bordering the Kansas Territory.

In July 1858, gold was discovered along the South Platte River in Arapahoe County, Kansas Territory. This discovery precipitated the Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Rush. Many residents of the mining region felt disconnected from the remote territorial governments of Kansas and Nebraska, so they voted to form their own Territory of Jefferson on October 24, 1859. The following month, the Jefferson Territorial Legislature organized 12 counties for the new territory, including St. Vrain County. St. Vrain County was named in honor of Ceran de Hault de Lassus de St. Vrain, the French trader who established the first trading post on the upper South Platte River. St. Vrain County encompassed much of what is today Weld County.

The Jefferson Territory never received federal sanction, but on February 28, 1861, U.S. President James Buchanan signed an act organizing the Territory of Colorado. On November 1, 1861, the Colorado General Assembly organized 17 counties, including Weld County, for the new Colorado Territory. Weld County was named for Lewis Ledyard Weld, a lawyer and territorial secretary. He died while serving in the Union Army during the Civil War. Until February 9, 1887, Weld County&#x27;s boundaries included the area now comprising Weld County, Washington County, Logan County, Morgan County, Yuma County, Phillips County, and Sedgwick County.

Weld County was thrust into the media spotlight on the evening of November 1, 1955, when United Airlines Flight 629, a Douglas DC-6B airliner flying from Denver to Portland, Oregon, exploded in midair and crashed, killing all 44 persons on board the plane and scattering bodies, wreckage and debris over a six-square-mile area of the county. The subsequent investigation of the accident revealed that Denver resident John Gilbert Graham had secretly placed a time bomb composed of 25 sticks of dynamite in a suitcase belonging to his mother, who was a passenger on the airplane. Graham was tried and convicted of the crime, and executed in 1957.

In northeastern Weld County, Minuteman III missile silo &quot;N-8&quot;, one of the many unmanned silos there, was the target of symbolic vandalism by Catholic peace activists in 2002.

Weld County also holds the distinction of having more confirmed tornado sightings than any other U.S. county from 1950 to 2011, with 252 confirmed reports.

On March 6, 2019, the county declared itself to be a Second Amendment sanctuary.

===Secession proposals===
In 2013, conservative Weld County commissioners began a campaign to secede from the State of Colorado to create a new state; a state ballot measure regarding the issue was put on the November 2013 ballot. The legality of this initiative has been questioned by local attorneys. On November 5, 2013, 6 out of 11 Colorado counties voted no for secession, including Elbert, Lincoln, Logan, Moffat, Sedgwick, and Weld counties voted no, while Cheyenne, Kit Carson, Phillips, Washington, and Yuma counties voted yes. &quot;Weld County voters said this is an option we shouldn&#x27;t pursue and we won&#x27;t pursue it,&quot; said Weld County Commissioner Sean Conway, &quot;But we will continue to look at the problems of the urban and rural divide in this state.&quot;
In 2021, a group known as &quot;Weld County, WY&quot; organized a petition to place a measure on the November 2021 ballot for the county to secede from Colorado to join Wyoming, due to a clash between the conservative politics of Weld County and the liberal government of Colorado. Mark Gordon, the Governor of Wyoming, said when asked about the topic, &quot;We would love that.&quot; In response to Gordon&#x27;s comment, Colorado Governor Jared Polis said, &quot;Hands off Weld County.&quot;

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which are land and (0.7%) are water. It is the third-largest county in Colorado by area.

Weld County lies within the relatively flat eastern portion of Colorado; the northeastern portions of the county contain the extensive Pawnee National Grassland and the Pawnee Buttes, which jut above the surrounding terrain and are surrounded by many small canyons and outcroppings. Along the western border, hilly areas indicate the presence of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains further west.

The county is served by two interstate highways: I-25 (US 87) runs through the southwestern corner and I-76 from the south central edge northeastward to the Morgan county border. Other major roads include US 85 and US 34, which intersect near Greeley, and State Highway 14, which runs through Ault.

The last five Republican presidential candidates have all obtained over 75 percent of Washington County&#x27;s vote.













In other statewide elections, Washington County also leans Republican, although the county was carried by Democrat Roy Romer by a narrow margin in 1990 – when he carried all but three counties statewide – by Dick Lamm in 1982 and by Constitution Party candidate Tom Tancredo in 2010.

<text>San Miguel County is a county located in the U.S. state of Colorado. As of the 2020 census, the population was 8,072. The county seat is Telluride. The county is named for the San Miguel River.

==History==
San Miguel County was given the Spanish language name for &quot;Saint Michael&quot; due to the nearby San Miguel River. On February 27, 1883, Ouray County was split to form San Miguel County. Originally the San Miguel County portion was to retain the name Ouray County with the new portion called Uncompahgre County.

Mining operators in the San Juan mountain area of Colorado formed the San Juan District Mining Association (SJDMA) in 1903, as a direct result of a Western Federation of Miners proposal to the Telluride Mining Association for the eight-hour day, which had been approved in a referendum by 72 percent of Colorado voters. The new association consolidated the power of thirty-six mining properties in San Miguel, Ouray, and San Juan counties. The SJDMA refused to consider any reduction in hours or increase in wages, helping to provoke a bitter strike.

In 1875, the Smuggler gold vein was discovered near Telluride. The Smuggler-Union, Tomboy, and Liberty Bell mines combined produced over a hundred tons of gold by 1920, third in the state of Colorado.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.2%) is water.

==Politics==
For most of the 20th century, San Miguel County was a national bellwether. It voted for the winner in every presidential election from 1912 to 1984. Since 1988, the county has become one of the most Democratic in Colorado and the nation, largely due to the presence of the Telluride Ski Resort and the influx of liberal-minded voters in the 1960s and 1970s. These trends have made San Miguel similar in vein to other heavily Democratic ski resort counties like Blaine County in Idaho, Teton County in Wyoming, and Pitkin County within Colorado. In the 2000 presidential election, San Miguel County was Green Party candidate Ralph Nader&#x27;s best countywide performance in the country with 17.2% of the vote.

<text>San Juan County is a county located in the U.S. state of Colorado. As of the 2020 census, the population was 705, making it the least populous county in Colorado. The county seat and the only incorporated municipality in the county is Silverton. The county name is the Spanish language name for &quot;Saint John&quot;, the name Spanish explorers gave to a river and the mountain range in the area. With a mean elevation of , San Juan County is the highest county in the United States and also has the two highest elevation houses in the United States; the ‘Bonnie Belle’ above Animas Forks at 11,900’ – 11,950’ elevation and an unnamed house above Picayune Gulch at 12,000’ elevation.

== History ==
Long before European settlement, the area was regularly explored by the Anasazi, and later the Utes, who hunted and lived in the San Juans during the summer. There is also speculation that Spanish explorers and fur traders ventured into the area in the 1600s and 1700s.

Permanent settlement in the area surrounding present-day San Juan County began in 1860, near the end of the Colorado Gold Rush. These first settlers were a group of prospectors led by Charles Baker, who made their way into the San Juan Mountains searching for gold.

After the Brunot Agreement with the Utes in 1873, which exchanged for the Southern Ute Indian Reservation and $25,000 per year, several mining camps were constructed. These would later become the communities of Howardsville, Eureka, and Silverton. San Juan County was formed on January 31, 1876, from part of La Plata County.

The region boomed after George Howard and R. J. McNutt discovered the Sunnyside silver vein along Hurricane Peak, outside the mining camp of Eureka. Gold was then discovered in 1882, which helped the county weather the Panic of 1893 far better than other mining communities, such as Aspen or Creede. The Sunnyside Mine would become one of Colorado&#x27;s longest running and most productive mines.

Mining operators in the San Juan mountain area of Colorado formed the San Juan District Mining Association (SJDMA) in 1903, as a direct result of a Western Federation of Miners proposal to the Telluride Mining Association for the eight-hour day, which had been approved in a referendum by 72 percent of Colorado voters. The new association consolidated the power of thirty-six mining properties in San Miguel, Ouray, and San Juan Counties. The SJDMA refused to consider any reduction in hours or increase in wages, helping to provoke a bitter strike.

The Sunnyside mine was shut down after the 1929 stock market crash, but was acquired by Standard Metals Corp. in 1959, and reopened, finding gold in 1973 with the Little Mary vein. The county&#x27;s economy was dealt a devastating blow in 1992 when the mine and the corresponding Shenandoah-Dives mill, the last operating in the region, permanently closed. The closure meant the end of jobs for over one third of the county&#x27;s workforce.

== Geography ==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.2%) is water. It is the fifth-smallest county in Colorado by area. The county is located in the heart of the San Juan Mountains of Colorado. Though it has the highest mean elevation of any county in the United States, at , none of Colorado&#x27;s 53 fourteeners (mountains at least 14,000 feet in elevation) are in San Juan County.

== Politics ==
In the era of William Jennings Bryan, San Juan County strongly favored the Democratic Party: no Republican managed to carry the county between 1892 and 1916, and it was even one of the few northern or western counties to vote for Alton B. Parker in 1904. It remained a Democratic-leaning county until the 1960s but then turned towards the Republican Party in subsequent decades. No Democratic presidential nominee won San Juan County between 1968 and 2000, although it was one of fifteen rural or remote counties to give a plurality to Ross Perot in 1992. Since John Kerry carried the county for his party for the first time in four decades at the 2004 election, San Juan County has voted Democratic at the last five Presidential elections.

==Politics==
Routt County tilted Republican for much of the second half of the 20th century. From 1952 to 1988, Republicans carried the county in all but one election. The one break in this trend came in 1964, when Lyndon Johnson won Routt by a healthy margin of 63–37.

Since the late 1980s, Routt County has trended Democratic. It swung from a 34-point win for Ronald Reagan in 1984 to only a five-point win for George H. W. Bush in 1988. In 1992, Bill Clinton became the first Democrat to win the county since 1964 and only the second since 1948, carrying it with modest pluralities in both of his bids. George W. Bush won the county in 2000 by only 264 votes. However, John Kerry won it by a 10-point majority in 2004, and since then Routt has become powerfully Democratic, with Democrats winning by margins rivaling those in the counties closer to Denver. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the county 54–37. Routt County continued its Democratic trend in 2020, with Joe Biden winning the county 63–35. This is the largest margin of victory for a Democratic presidential candidate in the county since the 1916 election.

<text>Rio Grande County is a county located in the U.S. state of Colorado. As of the 2020 census, the population was 11,539. The county seat is Del Norte. The county is named for the Rio Grande (Spanish language for &quot;Big River&quot;), which flows through the county.

==Description==
The gateway to the San Juan Mountains, Rio Grande County is one of the highlights of the San Luis Valley. The county covers ranging from approximately on valley floor to several peaks.

Monte Vista is the county&#x27;s largest community situated on the valley floor. &quot;Monte&quot;, as locals call it, is the center of the agricultural aspect of the county. There are numerous festivals, events, and clubs that take place in and around Monte Vista, and the Monte Vista National Wildlife Refuge is a stop for migratory Sand Hill Cranes every year.

The median household income was $37,711 and the median family income was $44,425. Males had a median income of $38,125 versus $19,940 for females. The per capita income for the county was $17,344. About 6.70% of families and 9.60% of the population were below the poverty line, including 11.60% of those under age 18 and 10.40% of those age 65 or over.

==Education==
Rio Blanco County is home to Meeker School District RE-1 and Rangely School District RE-4, as well as Rangely Christian Academy, a private K-8 school.

The county is home to Colorado Northwestern Community College in Rangely, as well as an extension of Colorado State University in Meeker.

==Politics==
Rio Blanco is an overwhelmingly Republican county in Presidential elections. It was along with Clark County, Idaho and Kane County, Utah one of only three counties west of the Continental Divide to vote for Alf Landon over Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1936. In that election Rio Blanco was Landon&#x27;s strongest county in the eleven western states, marginally shading normal Republican “banner county” Kane. Since that time only two Democrats – Harry S. Truman in 1948 and Lyndon Johnson who narrowly carried the county in 1964 – have obtained over forty percent of the county&#x27;s vote. In fact, since 1968 only one Democratic presidential candidate, Michael Dukakis in 1988, and him only very marginally, has topped thirty percent of Rio Blanco County&#x27;s ballots.












In other statewide elections, Rio Blanco County also leans Republican, although it was carried by Democrat Roy Romer in 1990 – when he carried all but four counties statewide – and by Constitution Party candidate Tom Tancredo in 2010. Rio Blanco County was also carried by Democratic Senatorial candidate “Nighthorse” Campbell in 1992, although since then no Democratic candidate for this office has surpassed thirty percent since.

<text>The fleur-de-lis, also spelled fleur-de-lys (plural &quot;fleurs-de-lis&quot; or &quot;fleurs-de-lys&quot;), is a common heraldic charge in the (stylized) shape of a lily (in French, and mean and respectively). Most notably, the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; (⚜️) is depicted on the traditional coat of arms of France that was used from the High Middle Ages until the French Revolution in 1792, and then again in brief periods in the 19th century. This design still represents France and the House of Bourbon in the form of marshalling in the arms of Spain, Quebec, and Canada — for example.

Other European nations have also employed the symbol. The &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; became &quot;at one and the same time, religious, political, dynastic, artistic, emblematic, and symbolic&quot;, especially in French heraldry. The Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph are among saints often depicted with a lily.

Some modern usage of the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; reflects &quot;the continuing presence of heraldry in everyday life&quot;, often intentionally, but also when users are not aware that they are &quot;prolonging the life of centuries-old insignia and emblems&quot;.

The &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; is represented in Unicode at in the Miscellaneous Symbols block.

==Etymology==
&quot;Fleur-de-lis&quot; is the stylized depiction of the lily flower. The name itself derives from ancient Greek &quot;λείριον&quot; &gt; Latin &quot;lilium&quot; &gt; French &quot;lis&quot;.

The lily has always been the symbol of fertility and purity, and in Christianity it symbolizes the Immaculate Conception.

==Origin==
According to Pierre-Augustin Boissier de Sauvages, an 18th-century French naturalist and lexicographer:
The old fleurs-de-lis, especially the ones found in our first kings&#x27; sceptres, have a lot less in common with ordinary lilies than the flowers called &quot;flambas&quot; [in Occitan], or irises, from which the name of our own fleur-de-lis may derive. What gives some colour of truth to this hypothesis that we already put forth, is the fact that the French or Franks, before entering Gaul itself, lived for a long time around the river named Lys in the Flanders. Nowadays, this river is still bordered with an exceptional number of irises —as many plants grow for centuries in the same places—: these irises have yellow flowers, which is not a typical feature of lilies but fleurs-de-lis. It was thus understandable that our kings, having to choose a symbolic image for what later became a coat of arms, set their minds on the iris, a flower that was common around their homes, and is also as beautiful as it was remarkable. They called it, in short, the fleur-de-lis, instead of the flower of the river of &quot;lis&quot;. This flower, or iris, looks like our fleur-de-lis not just because of its yellow colour but also because of its shape: of the six petals, or leaves, that it has, three of them are alternatively straight and meet at their tops. The other three on the opposite, bend down so that the middle one seems to make one with the stalk and only the two ones facing out from left and right can clearly be seen, which is again similar with our fleurs-de-lis, that is to say exclusively the one from the river Luts whose white petals bend down too when the flower blooms.


The heraldist François Velde is known to have expressed the same opinion:
However, a hypothesis ventured in the 17th c. sounds very plausible to me. One species of wild iris, the &quot;Iris pseudacorus&quot;, yellow flag in English, is yellow and grows in marshes (cf. the azure field, for water). Its name in German is Lieschblume (also gelbe Schwertlilie), but Liesch was also spelled Lies and Leys in the Middle Ages. It is easy to imagine that, in Northern France, the Lieschblume would have been called &#x27;fleur-de-lis&#x27;. This would explain the name and the formal origin of the design, as a stylized yellow flag. There is a fanciful legend about Clovis which links the yellow flag explicitly with the French coat of arms.

===Alternative derivations===
Another (debated) hypothesis is that the symbol derives from the &quot;angon&quot; or &quot;sting&quot;, a typical Frankish throwing spear.

===Ancient usages===
It has consistently been used as a royal emblem, though different cultures have interpreted its meaning in varying ways. Gaulish coins show the first Western designs which look similar to modern &quot;fleurs-de-lis&quot;. In the East it was found on the gold helmet of a Scythian king uncovered at the Ak-Burun kurgan and conserved in Saint Petersburg&#x27;s Hermitage Museum.

See also the very similar lily symbol on coins from the Achemenid and Ptolemaic province of Yehud (c. 350-200 BCE) and Hasmonean-ruled Judah (2nd and 1st century BCE).

Among the pre-Columbian Maya of Central America, the water lily represented the watery surface of the underworld and the Earth&#x27;s regenerative power, being depicted as a fleur-de-lis in Maya art. The fleur-de-lis also appears alongside some depictions of the rain god Chaac, the Maya counterpart of the Aztec Tlaloc or Zapotec Cocijo.

List in alphabetical order by country:

===Albania===
In Albania, &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; () has been associated with the different Albanian noble families. This iconic symbol holds a rich historical significance and has adorned the emblems and crests of various noble houses, reflecting both cultural heritage and a sense of identity within the country. One notable household that has prominently featured this emblem is the Thopia family a ruling house in Medieval Albania during the Medieval Kingdom of Albania. Karl Thopia was a grandson of Robert of Anjou. A few other notable Albanian families that have distinctly featured the iconic &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; in their heraldic coat of arms are the Durazzo family, Skuraj family, Muzaka family, Luccari family, Engjëlli family and many other Albanian noble families.
===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
The &quot;fleurs-de-lis&quot; was the symbol of the House of Kotromanić, a ruling house in medieval Bosnia during the medieval Kingdom of Bosnia, adopted by the first Bosnian king, Tvrtko I, in recognition of the Capetian House of Anjou support in assuming the throne of Bosnia. The coat of arms contained six &quot;fleurs-de-lis&quot;, where the flower itself is today often considered to be a representation of the autochthonous golden lily, &quot;Lilium bosniacum&quot;.

The emblem was revived in 1992 as a national symbol of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and was part of the flag of Bosnia-Herzegovina from 1992 to 1998. The state insignia were changed in 1999. The former flag of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina contains a &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; alongside the Croatian chequy. Fleurs also appear in the flags and arms of many cantons, municipalities, cities and towns. Today, it is a traditional symbol of the Bosniak people. It is still used as official insignia of the Bosniak Regiment of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

&quot;Fleurs-de-lis&quot; today also appear in the flags and arms of many cantons, municipalities, cities and towns of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
===Brazil===
In Brazil, the arms and flag of the city of Joinville feature three &quot;fleurs-de-lis&quot; surmounted with a label of three points (for the House of Orléans), alluding to François d&#x27;Orléans, Prince of Joinville, son of King Louis-Philippe I of France, who married Princess Francisca of Brazil in 1843.

===Byzantium (Roman Empire) ===

The &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; pattern is clearly depicted in an illustration of emperor Nikephoros Phocas&#x27;s welcome ceremony in Constantinople (963 AD) included in Synopsis Istorion (dated 1070s).

The &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; pattern can also be found on Ionic capital of Panagia Skripo church (dated 870AD):
===Canada===

The Royal Banner of France or &quot;Bourbon flag&quot; symbolizing royal France, was the most commonly used flag in New France. The &quot;Bourbon flag&quot; has three gold &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; on a dark blue field arranged two and one. The fleur-de-lys was also seen on New France&#x27;s currency often referred to as &quot;card money&quot;. The white Royal Banner of France was used by the military of New France and was seen on naval vessels and forts of New France. After the fall of New France to the British Empire the fleur-de-lys remained visible on churches and remained part of French cultural symbolism. There are many French-speaking Canadians for whom the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; remains a symbol of their French cultural identity. Québécois, Franco-Ontarians, Franco-Ténois and Franco-Albertans, feature the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; prominently on their flags.

The fleur-de-lys, as a traditional royal symbol in Canada, has been incorporated into many national symbols, provincial symbols and municipal symbols, the Canadian Red Ensign that served as the nautical flag and civil ensign for Canada from 1892 to 1965 and later as an informal flag of Canada before 1965 featured the traditional number of three golden fleur-de-lys on a blue background. The arms of Canada throughout its variations has used fleur-de-lys, beginning in 1921 and subsequent various has featuring the blue &quot;Bourbon Flag&quot; in two locations within arms. The Canadian royal cypher and the arms of Canada feature St Edward&#x27;s Crown that displays five cross pattée and four fleur-de-lys. The &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; is featured on the flag of Quebec, known as the &quot;fleurdelisé&quot;, as well as the flags of the cities of Montreal, Sherbrooke and Trois-Rivières.
===France===
====Royal symbol: background, later legends====
The &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; symbolic origins with French monarchs may stem from the baptismal lily used in the crowning of King Clovis I (r. c. 481–509). The French monarchy may have adopted the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; for its royal coat of arms as a symbol of purity to commemorate the conversion of Clovis I, and a reminder of the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; ampulla that held the oil used to anoint the king. So, the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; stood as a symbol of the king&#x27;s divinely approved right to rule. The thus &quot;anointed&quot; kings of France later maintained that their authority was directly from God. A legend enhances the mystique of royalty by informing us that a vial of oil—the Holy Ampulla—descended from Heaven to anoint and sanctify Clovis as King, descending directly on Clovis or perhaps brought by a dove to Saint Remigius. One version explains that an angel descended with the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; ampulla to anoint the king. Another story tells of Clovis putting a flower in his helmet just before his victory at the Battle of Vouillé. Through this propagandist connection to Clovis, the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; has been taken in retrospect to symbolize all the Christian Frankish kings, most notably Charlemagne.
The graphic evolution of &quot;crita&quot; to &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; was accompanied by textual allegory. By the late 13th century, an allegorical poem by Guillaume de Nangis (d. 1300), written at Joyenval Abbey in Chambourcy, relates how the golden lilies on an azure ground were miraculously substituted for the crescents on Clovis&#x27; shield, a projection into the past of contemporary images of heraldry.

In the 14th century, French writers asserted that the monarchy of France, which developed from the Kingdom of the West Franks, could trace its heritage back to the divine gift of royal arms received by Clovis. This story has remained popular, even though modern scholarship has established that the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; was a religious symbol before it was a true heraldic symbol. Along with true lilies, it was associated with the Virgin Mary, and when the 12th-century Capetians, Louis VI and Louis VII, started to use the emblem, their purpose was of connecting their rulership with this symbol of saintliness and divine right.

====First royal symbol; &quot;France Ancient&quot;====
Louis VI (r. 1108–1137) and Louis VII (r. 1137–1180) of the House of Capet first started to use the emblem, on sceptres for example. Louis VII ordered the use of &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; clothing in his son Philip&#x27;s coronation in 1179, while the first visual evidence of clearly heraldic use dates from 1211: a seal showing the future Louis VIII and his shield strewn with the &quot;flowers&quot;.

Until the late 14th century the French royal coat of arms was &quot;Azure semé-de-lis Or&quot; (a blue shield &quot;sown&quot; (&quot;semé&quot;) with a scattering of small golden &quot;fleurs-de-lis&quot;), the so-called &quot;France Ancient&quot;, but Charles V of France changed the design to a group of three in about 1376 (see next section for &quot;France Modern&quot;).

In the reign of King Louis IX (St. Louis) the three petals of the flower were said to represent faith, wisdom and chivalry, and to be a sign of divine favour bestowed on France. During the next century, the 14th, the tradition of Trinity symbolism was established in France, and then spread elsewhere.

====English claims====
In 1328, King Edward III of England inherited a claim to the crown of France, and in about 1340 he quartered &quot;France Ancient&quot; with the arms of Plantagenet, as &quot;arms of pretence&quot;. After the kings of France adopted &quot;France Modern&quot;, the kings of England adopted the new design as quarterings from about 1411. The monarchs of England (and later of Great Britain) continued to quarter the French arms until 1801, when George III abandoned his formal claim to the French throne.

On 29 December 1429, King Charles VII ennobled the family of Joan of Arc, seen as a French hero in the ensueing Hundred Years&#x27; War, with an inheritable symbolic denomination. The Chamber of Accounts in France registered the family&#x27;s designation to nobility on 20 January 1430. The grant permitted the family to change their surname to du Lys.

====&quot;France Moderne&quot; (1376–1790s, etc.)====
In about 1376, Charles V changed the design from the all-over scattering of flowers to a group of three, thus replacing what is known in heraldic terminology as the &quot;France Ancient&quot;, with the &quot;France Modern&quot;.

&quot;France moderne&quot; remained the French royal standard, and with a white background was the French national flag until the French Revolution, when it was replaced by the tricolor of modern-day France. The &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; was restored to the French flag in 1814, but replaced once again after the revolution against Charles X in 1830. 

After the end of the Second French Empire, Henri, comte de Chambord, was offered the throne as King of France, but he agreed only if France gave up the tricolor and brought back the white flag with &quot;fleurs-de-lis&quot;. Curiously the French &quot;tricolore&quot; with the royal crown and fleur-de-lys was possibly designed by the count in his younger years as a compromise. His condition that his country needed to abandon the red and blue colors that it had adopted to symbolize the ideals of the French Revolution of 1789 was rejected and France became a republic.

====Current use====
It remains an enduring symbol of France which appears on French postage stamps, although it has never been adopted officially by any of the French republics, that unlike other republican nations, never officially adopted a coat of arms. 

Although the origin of the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; is unclear, it has retained an association with French nobility and associated cities and regions. It is widely used in French city emblems as in the coat of arms of the city of Lille, Saint-Denis, Brest, Clermont-Ferrand, Boulogne-Billancourt, and Calais. Some cities that had been particularly faithful to the French Crown were awarded a heraldic augmentation of two or three &quot;fleurs-de-lis&quot; on the chief of their coat of arms; such cities include Paris, Lyon, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Reims, Le Havre, Angers, Le Mans, Aix-en-Provence, Tours, Limoges, Amiens, Orléans, Rouen, Argenteuil, Poitiers, Chartres, and Laon, among others. The &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; was the symbol of Île-de-France, the core of the French kingdom. It has appeared on the coat-of-arms of other historical provinces of France including Burgundy, Anjou, Picardy, Berry, Orléanais, Bourbonnais, Maine, Touraine, Artois, Dauphiné, Saintonge, and the County of La Marche. Many of the current French &quot;departments&quot; use the symbol on their coats-of-arms to express this heritage.

The &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; appears for instance on the coat-of-arms of Guadeloupe, an overseas département of France in the Caribbean, Saint Barthélemy, an overseas collectivity of France, and French Guiana. The overseas department of Réunion in the Indian Ocean uses the same feature. It appears on the coat of Port Louis, the capital of Mauritius which was named in honour of King Louis XV. On the coat of arms of Saint Lucia it represents the French heritage of the country.
While the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; has appeared on countless European coats of arms and flags over the centuries, it is particularly associated with the French monarchy in a historical context and continues to appear in the arms of members of the Spanish branch of the French House of Bourbon, including the king of Spain and the grand duke of Luxembourg.

====Duby&#x27;s interpretation====
According to French historian Georges Duby, the three petals represent the three medieval social estates: the commoners, the nobility, and the clergy.

===Italy and the pope===
In Italy, the fleur de lis - called &quot;giglio bottonato&quot; (it) - is mainly known from the crest of the city of Florence. In the Florentine &quot;fleurs-de-lis&quot; the stamens are always posed between the petals. Originally &quot;argent&quot; (silver or white) on &quot;gules&quot; (red) background, the emblem became the standard of the imperial party in Florence (&quot;parte ghibellina&quot;), causing the town government, which maintained a staunch &quot;Guelph&quot; stance, being strongly opposed to the imperial pretensions on city states, to reverse the color pattern to the final &quot;gules&quot; lily on &quot;argent&quot; background. This heraldic charge is often known as the Florentine lily to distinguish it from the conventional (stamen-not-shown) design. As an emblem of the city, it is therefore found in icons of Zenobius, its first bishop, and associated with Florence&#x27;s patron Saint John the Baptist in the Florentine fiorino. Several towns subjugated by Florence or founded within the territory of the Florentine Republic adopted a variation of the Florentine lily in their crests, often without the stamens.

In Italy, &quot;fleurs-de-lis&quot; have been used for some papal crowns and coats of arms, the Farnese Dukes of Parma, and by some doges of Venice.
===Lithuania===
The design of the arms of Jurbarkas is believed to originate from the arms of the Sapieha house, a Lithuanian noble family which was responsible for Jurbarkas receiving city rights and a coat of arms in 1611.

The three &quot;fleurs-de-lis&quot; design on the Jurbarkas coat of arms was abolished during the final years of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, but officially restored in 1993 after the independence of present-day Lithuania was re-established. Before restoration, several variant designs, such as using one over two &quot;fleurs-de-lis&quot;, had been restored and abolished. The original two over one version was briefly readopted in 1970 during the Soviet occupation, but abolished that same year.

===Malta, Order of Malta===
Three &quot;fleurs-de-lis&quot; appeared in the personal coat of arms of Grandmaster Alof de Wignacourt who ruled the Malta between 1601 and 1622. His nephew Adrien de Wignacourt, who was Grandmaster himself from 1690 to 1697, also had a similar coat of arms with three &quot;fleurs-de-lis&quot;.

The town of Santa Venera has three red &quot;fleurs-de-lis&quot; on its flag and coat of arms. These are derived from an arch which was part of the Wignacourt Aqueduct that had three sculpted &quot;fleurs-de-lis&quot; on top, as they were the heraldic symbols of Alof de Wignacourt, the Grand Master who financed its building. Another suburb which developed around the area became known as Fleur-de-Lys, and it also features a red &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; on its flag and coat of arms.

===Serbia===
The &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; was the symbol of the House of Nemanjic, a ruling Serbian Orthodox house in medieval Serbia during the medieval Principality of Serbia, Grand Principality of Serbia, Kingdom of Serbia and Serbian Empire, adopted by the Serbian king, Stefan Nemanjić. The coat of arms contained two &quot;fleurs-de-lis&quot;. Today, the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; is, alongside the Serbian Cross, Serbian eagle and Serbian Flag, national symbols of the Serb people.

Fleurs also appear in the flags and arms of many municipalities.
===United Kingdom===
&quot;Fleurs-de-lis&quot; feature prominently in the Crown Jewels of England and Scotland. In English heraldry, they are used in many different ways, and can be the cadency mark of the sixth son. Additionally, it features in a large number of royal arms of the House of Plantagenet, from the 13th century onwards to the early Tudors (Elizabeth of York and the de la Pole family).

The – (flowered border) has been a prominent part of the design of the Scottish royal arms and Royal Standard since James I of Scotland.

&lt;poem&gt;
The treasured fleur-de-luce he claims
To wreathe his shield, since royal James
 —Sir Walter Scott, &quot;The Lay of the Last Minstrel&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

In the United Kingdom, a &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; has appeared in the official arms of the Norroy King of Arms for hundreds of years. A silver &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; on a blue background is the arms of the Barons Digby.

In English and Canadian heraldry the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; is the cadence mark of a sixth son.

A &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; can also be seen on the flag of Monmouthshire, Wales: Per pale azure and sable three &quot;fleurs-de-lys&quot; or.

It can also be found on the arms of the Scottish clan chiefs of both Carruthers; gules two engrailed chevrons between three &quot;fleur-d-lis&quot; or and the brouns/browns: gules a chevron between three &quot;fleur d-lis&quot; or.
===United States===
&quot;Fleurs-de-lis&quot; crossed the Atlantic along with Europeans going to the New World, especially with French settlers. Their presence on North American flags and coats of arms usually recalls the involvement of French settlers in New France of the town or region concerned, and in some cases the persisting presence there of a population descended from such settlers.
In the US, the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; symbols tend to be along or near the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. These are areas of strong French colonial empire settlement. Some of the places that have it in their flag or seal are the cities of Baton Rouge, Detroit, Lafayette, Louisville, Mobile, New Orleans, Ocean Springs and St. Louis. On 9 July 2008, Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal signed a bill into law making the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; an official symbol of the state. Following Hurricane Katrina on 29 August 2005, the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; has been widely used in New Orleans and throughout Louisiana, as a symbol of grassroots support for New Orleans&#x27; recovery. The coat of arms of St. Augustine, Florida has a &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; on the first quarter, due to its connection with Huguenots. Several counties have flags and seals based on pre-1801 British royal arms also includes &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; symbols. They are King George County, Virginia and Prince George&#x27;s County, Somerset County, Kent County, and Montgomery County in Maryland.
It has also become the symbol for the identity of the Cajuns and Louisiana Creole people, and their French heritage.
===Other countries, cities, families===
Other countries include:
*Spain, in recognition of rulers from the House of Bourbon.

*Principality of Moldova 
:Coins minted in the Principality of Moldavia (today split between Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine) during the reign of Peter II of Moldavia (r. 1375–1391), carry the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; symbol.

*Germany: Fugger family
:As a dynastic emblem it has also been very widely used, not only by noble families but also, for example, by the Fuggers, a medieval banking family.

*Other European cities
:Among the numerous cities which use it as a symbol are some whose names echo the word &quot;lily&quot;, for example, Liljendal, Finland, and Lelystad, Netherlands. This is called canting arms in heraldic terminology. Other European examples of municipal coats-of-arms bearing the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; include Lincoln in England, Morcín in Spain, Wiesbaden and Darmstadt in Germany, the Swiss municipality of Schlieren, Skierniewice in Poland, and Brody in Ukraine. The Baltic cities of Jurbarkas (see above under Lithuania), Daugavpils in Latvia, and the municipality of Jõelähtme in Estonia also have one or more &quot;fleurs-de-lis&quot; on their coats-of-arms.
==Military==
&quot;Fleurs-de-lis&quot; are featured in the military heraldry of various nations.

The British Army&#x27;s 63rd Regiment of Foot started using the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; as a regimental symbol from the mid-18th century onwards, supposedly to commemorate their role in Britain&#x27;s capture of Guadeloupe from France in 1759. In 1881, the 63rd Regiment was reorganised into the Manchester Regiment, which also used the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; as a regimental symbol, and in 1923 it was officially approved as the regiment&#x27;s cap badge. The regiment&#x27;s successor unit, the King&#x27;s Regiment, continued to use the same cap badge from 1958 until its amalgamation into the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment in 2006.

It is also the formation sign of the 2nd (Independent) Armored Brigade of the Indian Army, known as the 7th Indian Cavalry Brigade in First World War, which received the emblem for its actions in France.

In the United States, the New Jersey Army National Guard unit 112th Field Artillery (Self Propelled)—part of the much larger 42nd Infantry Division Mechanized—has the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; in the upper left side of their distinctive unit insignia; the U.S. Army&#x27;s 2nd Cavalry Regiment, 319th Airborne Field Artillery Regiment, 62nd Medical Brigade, 256th Infantry Brigade Combat Team; and the Corps of Cadets at Louisiana State University. The U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Special Operations Weather beret flash also used a &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; in its design, carried over from its Vietnam War-era commando weatherman beret flash.

It is also featured by the Israeli Intelligence Corps established in the 1970s, and the First World War Canadian Expeditionary Force.

The Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine used the emblem with the coat of arms of Ukraine in conjunction with four golden &quot;fleurs-de-lis&quot;, along with the motto &quot;Omnia, Vincit, Veritas&quot;.

==Religion and art==
In the Middle Ages, the symbols of lily and &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; overlapped considerably in Christian religious art. The historian Michel Pastoureau says that until about 1300 they were found in depictions of Jesus, but gradually they took on Marian symbolism and were associated with the Song of Solomon&#x27;s &quot;lily among thorns&quot; (&quot;lilium inter spinas&quot;), understood as a reference to Mary. Other scripture and religious literature in which the lily symbolizes purity and chastity also helped establish the flower as an iconographic attribute of the Virgin. It was also believed that the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; represented the Holy Trinity.

In medieval England, from the mid-12th century, a noblewoman&#x27;s seal often showed the lady with a &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot;, drawing on the Marian connotations of &quot;female virtue and spirituality&quot;. Images of Mary holding the flower first appeared in the 11th century on coins issued by cathedrals dedicated to her, and next on the seals of cathedral chapters, starting with Notre Dame de Paris in 1146. A standard portrayal was of Mary carrying the flower in her right hand, just as she is shown in that church&#x27;s Virgin of Paris statue (with lily), and in the centre of the stained glass rose window (with &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; sceptre) above its main entrance. The flowers may be &quot;simple , sometimes garden lilies, sometimes genuine heraldic fleurs-de-lis&quot;. As attributes of the Madonna, they are often seen in pictures of the Annunciation, notably in those of Sandro Botticelli and Filippo Lippi. Lippi also uses both flowers in other related contexts: for instance, in his &quot;Madonna in the Forest&quot;.

The three petals of the heraldic design reflect a widespread association with the Holy Trinity, with the band on the bottom symbolizing Mary. The tradition says that without Mary no one can understand the Trinity since it was she who bore the Son. A tradition going back to 14th-century France added onto the earlier belief that they also represented faith, wisdom and chivalry. Alternatively, the cord can be seen as representing the one divine substance (godhood) of the three persons, which binds them together.

&quot;Flower of light&quot; symbolism has sometimes been understood from the archaic variant &quot;fleur-de-luce&quot; (see Latin &quot;lux, luc-&quot; = &#x27;light&#x27;), but the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; suggests this arose from the spelling, not from the etymology.

==Civilian institutions and organisations==
===Education===
The emblem appears in coats of arms and logos for universities (like Washington University in St. Louis, Saint Louis University in Spain, Rossall School in England {where it appears in the namesake Mitre Fleur De Lys boarding house}, University of Lincoln in England and University of Louisiana at Lafayette) and schools such as in Hilton College (South Africa), Adamson University and St. Paul&#x27;s University in the Philippines. The Lady Knights of the University of Arkansas at Monticello have also adopted the fleur de lis as one of the symbols associated with their coat of arms. The flag of Lincolnshire, adopted in 2005, has a &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; for the city of Lincoln. It is one of the symbols of the American sororities Kappa Kappa Gamma and Theta Phi Alpha, the American fraternities Alpha Epsilon Pi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Alpha Mu, as well as the international co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega. It is also used by the high school and college fraternity Scouts Royale Brotherhood of the Philippines.

===Scouting===

The &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; is the main element in the logo of most Scouting organizations. The symbol was first used by Sir Robert Baden-Powell as an arm-badge for soldiers who qualified as scouts (reconnaissance specialists) in the 5th Dragoon Guards, which he commanded at the end of the 19th century; it was later used in cavalry regiments throughout the British Army until 1921. In 1907, Baden-Powell made brass &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; badges for the boys attending his first experimental &quot;Boy Scout&quot; camp at Brownsea Island. In his seminal book &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;, Baden-Powell referred to the motif as &quot;the arrowhead which shows the North on a map or a compass&quot; and continued; &quot;It is the Badge of the Scout because it points in the right direction and upward ... The three points remind you of the three points of the Scout Promise&quot;, being duty to God and country, helping others, and keeping the Scout Law. The World Scout Emblem of the World Organization of the Scout Movement has elements which are used by most national Scout organizations. The stars stand for truth and knowledge, the encircling rope for unity, and its reef knot or square knot, service.
===Sports===
The &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; is used by a number of sports teams, especially when it echoes a local flag. This is true with the teams from Quebec (Nordiques (ex-NHL), Montreal Expos (ex-MLB) and CF Montréal (MLS)), the teams of Louisiana and the Louisiana Ragin&#x27; Cajuns (NCAA Division I), the Serie A team Fiorentina, the Bundesliga side SV Darmstadt 98 (also known as &quot;Die Lilien&quot; – The Lilies), the rugby league team Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, the NPSL team Detroit City FC.
Marc-André Fleury, a Canadian ice hockey goaltender, has a &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; logo on his mask. The UFC Welterweight Champion from 2006 to 2013, Georges St-Pierre, has a tattoo of the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; on his right calf. The IT University of Copenhagen&#x27;s soccer team ITU F.C. has it in its logo. The official emblem for the 

==Art and entertainment==
===Architecture and design===
Architects and designers use it alone and as a repeated motif in a wide range of contexts, from ironwork to bookbinding.

In building and architecture, the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; is often placed on top of iron fence posts, as a pointed defence against intruders. It may ornament any tip, point or post with a decorative flourish, for instance, on finials, the arms of a cross, or the point of a gable. The &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; can be incorporated in friezes or cornices, although the distinctions between &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot;, fleuron, and other stylized flowers are not always clear, or can be used as a motif in an all-over tiled pattern, perhaps on a floor.
It may appear in a building for heraldic reasons, as in some English churches where the design paid a compliment to a local lord who used the flower on his coat of arms. Elsewhere the effect seems purely visual, like the crenellations on the 14th-century Muslim Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan.
It can also be seen on the doors of the 16th-century Hindu Padmanabhaswamy Temple.

===Literature===
During the reign of Elizabeth I of England, known as the Elizabethan era, it was a standard name for an iris, a usage which lasted for centuries, but occasionally refers to lilies or other flowers.

===Video games===
A heavily stylized &quot;fleur de lis&quot; symbol can be recognized as the symbol of the ICA in the &quot;Hitman&quot; series of video games.

In the &quot;Saints Row&quot; franchise, the &quot;fleur de lis&quot; is the Logo (called &quot;Fleur De Saints&quot;) for the Third Street Saints.

In the &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; franchise, the &quot;Fleur De Lis&quot; is the faction icon for the Adeptas Sororitas.

The Pokémon villain Lysandre, whose debut game was &quot;Pokémon X and Y&quot;, is known in Japan as フラダリ &quot;Furadari&quot; meaning &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot;.
&quot;Pokémon X and Y&quot; are inspired by France.
Many locations and landmarks across Kalos have real-world inspirations, including Prism Tower (Eiffel Tower), the Lumiose Art Museum (the Louvre) and the stones outside Geosenge Town (Carnac stones).

==Punishment==
===French colonial empire===

In the French colonial empire, the &quot;Code Noir&quot;, a slave code drafted by Jean-Baptiste Colbert, stipulated that enslaved people should be branded with the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; as punishment for a variety of crimes, including attempting to escape enslavement or theft. French officials in the colony of Isle de France (modern-day Mauritius), which adopted the &quot;Code Noir&quot; in 1685, punished slaves who attempted to escape or stole property by branding them with the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot;. In the French colony of Louisiana, which adopted the &quot;Code Noir&quot; in 1724, slaves who attempted to escape and were recaptured would be branded on one shoulder with the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; along with having their ears cut off. If they attempted to escape a second time, they would be punished by being branded with the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; again and have their hamstrings cut. Capital punishment was used for those who attempted to escape a third time.

Louisiana&#x27;s version of the &quot;Code Noir&quot; stated:
Branding slaves with the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; was also a punishment used in the French colony of Saint-Domingue.

===France===

Being branded with the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; was also a punishment used in Metropolitan France. In his 1577 biography of French Protestant reformer John Calvin, Jérôme-Hermès Bolsec claimed that Calvin had committed sodomy in his hometown of Noyon in 1527, and he only at the last minute escaped the standard punishment of death by burning, instead being branded with a &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; on his shoulder. Bolsec&#x27;s claims are today viewed as libellous slander, but they offer a window into what seemed a plausible punishment in his time. Alexandre Dumas used the motive of branding thieves with the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot; when he created the character of Milady de Winter in his 1844 novel &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. He set the branding episode in 1619 France.

==Politics==
Pitkin County favored the Republican nominee in the 1884 and 1888 presidential elections, but in 1892 supported the Populist nominee, James B. Weaver, when Democratic nominee Grover Cleveland wasn&#x27;t on the ballot in Colorado. Pitkin County favored the Democratic nominees from 1896 to 1916, voting for them in every election in that period, and being one of the few Western counties to support Alton B. Parker in 1904. From 1920, Pitkin County followed national trends until being narrowly carried by losing candidate Thomas E. Dewey in 1944. Pitkin was largely Republican-leaning until the growing ski resort community drew its residents to the liberal George McGovern – rejected by a majority of the electorates of all but 129 other counties – in 1972. Like many ski destination counties, since 1988 Pitkin has turned heavily Democratic. The last Republican to carry the county was Ronald Reagan in 1984. George H. W. Bush was the last Republican to gain even a third of Pitkin County&#x27;s vote since then.

In this modern era, Pitkin has also frequently been one of the leading counties for third-party candidates, being the fourth-best county in the nation for Eugene McCarthy in 1976 and the third-best for John B. Anderson in 1980.

<text>Ouray County () is a county located in the U.S. state of Colorado. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 4,874. The county seat is Ouray. Because of its rugged mountain topography, Ouray County is also known as the &quot;Switzerland of America&quot;.

==History==
Ouray County was formed out of San Juan County on January 18, 1877, making Ouray County the first county designated by the newly formed Colorado General Assembly. It was named for Chief Ouray, a distinguished leader of the Ute tribe, as was the municipality of Ouray, which was designated its county seat on March 8, 1877. On February 19, 1881, Dolores County was formed out of parts of Ouray County.

On February 27, 1883, Ouray County was split into San Miguel County and what is currently Ouray County. The portion that became San Miguel County almost retained the name Ouray County when the Colorado General Assembly initially renamed today&#x27;s Ouray County as Uncompahgre County, but four days later, on March 2, 1883, the General Assembly changed its mind and reverted the name of Uncompahgre County back to Ouray County.
The Ouray County Courthouse was constructed in Ouray in 1888 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Mining operators in the San Juan Mountains area of Colorado formed the San Juan District Mining Association (SJDMA) in 1903, as a direct result of a Western Federation of Miners proposal to the Telluride Mining Association for the eight-hour day, which had been approved in a referendum by 72 percent of Colorado voters. The new association consolidated the power of 36 mining properties in San Miguel, Ouray, and San Juan counties. The SJDMA refused to consider any reduction in hours or increase in wages, helping to provoke a bitter strike.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.1%) is water. The highest point in Ouray County is Mount Sneffels, at 14,150 feet above sea level. Many high peaks of more than 13,300 feet also exist. Other prominent features in Ouray County include Log Hill Mesa and Pleasant Valley.

==Politics==
In the first three elections that it participated in, from 1880 until 1888, Ouray County voted for Republican presidential candidates, before voting for Populist James B. Weaver in 1892, and then for the Democrats from 1896 to 1908. Then, from 1912 until 1944, Ouray County was a swing county that voted for the winner of each election from Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s 1912 victory to Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s 1940 victory; however, it broke that streak when it went for Thomas E. Dewey in 1944. Between 1944 and 2004, it transformed into a Republican stronghold, with Lyndon B. Johnson being the only Democrat to win the county in his 1964 landslide, with Republicans frequently getting 50-60% of the vote, even reaching more than 70% in Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan&#x27;s 49-state landslides in 1972 and 1984. In fact, Nixon and Reagan are the only candidates in history to receive 70% of the vote in the county, and Reagan remains the second-to-last candidate to even receive above 60% here, the last being George H. W. Bush in 1988. However, starting with Barack Obama&#x27;s victory in 2008, Ouray County has transformed into a Democratic powerhouse, with Joe Biden winning it by almost 20 points in 2020.













==Recreation==
Ouray County is home to many parks and hiking trails. The Ridgway State Park is located due north of Ridgway on the Ridgway Reservoir and includes a marina and camping facilities, as well as an extensive trail system. Within and surrounding the county are the Uncompahgre National Forest, Mount Sneffels Wilderness, and the Uncompahgre Wilderness. Leading through the county is the Bear Creek National Recreation Trail. Well known for its view of the San Juan Mountains and Cimarron Range, scenic highways such as the Alpine Loop National Scenic Back Country Byway and San Juan Skyway National Scenic Byway exist. The Great Parks Bicycle Route and Western Express Bicycle Route also go through Ouray County.

The Elks Lodge in Ouray County is one of only a few surviving American locations for a bowling alley facility that uses exclusively human-operated pinsetting units to set the tenpins for bowling on its pair of vintage wood bowling lanes.
==Communities==

Ouray County has two home rule municipalities, and seven unincorporated communities. For statistical purposes, the U.S. Census Bureau has defined three of these as census-designated places (CDP). The home rule municipalities are the city of Ouray and town of Ridgway, also the most populous settlements in the county. Loghill Village is the next largest development. Along with Loghill, Portland and Colona serve as census-designated places within Ouray County. The other unincorporated communities within the county are Camp Bird, Dallas, Thistledown, and Eldredge. All the communities, with the exception of Ridgway and Ouray, serve as primarily residential communities, though Loghill Village maintains a small tourism sector.

Colona, Eldredge, and Dallas are located in the northern reaches of the county along U.S. Highway 550, though Eldredge and Dallas are located within the valleys of the San Juan Mountains while Colona is in the short stretch of the Uncompahgre Valley within Ouray County. Portland is placed down valley of Ouray, though still south of Ridgway. Camp Bird and Thistledown are communities placed southwest of Ouray on Camp Bird Road. From north to south the communities are Colona, Eldredge, Dallas, Ridgway, Ouray, and then southwest along Camp Bird Road to Thistledown and Camp Bird. The historic towns of Sneffels and Ironton are located further west from Camp Bird and south of Ouray, respectively. Populations listed below are from the 2010 United States census data.

==Politics==
Otero is a strongly Republican county, although less so than the counties of the Colorado High Plains. It was last won for the Democratic Party by Bill Clinton in 1996. Before that, Otero tended to be a Republican-leaning county at the Presidential level, although it did vote for Wilson twice, FDR in 1932 and 1936, Truman in 1948 and Lyndon Johnson in 1964.

==Politics==
Morgan County has long been one of the Republican Party&#x27;s major strongholds in Colorado. It was one of only three Colorado counties (the others being El Paso County and Larimer County) to vote for the re-election of Herbert Hoover in 1932, and the only Democrat to obtain an absolute majority in the county since 1920 has been Lyndon Johnson in 1964 – although Roosevelt did win a plurality in 1936.












In other statewide elections, the county also leans strongly Republican, although it was carried by Democrat Roy Romer in 1990 – when he carried all but four counties statewide – by Dick Lamm in 1982 and by Constitution Party candidate Tom Tancredo in 2010.

==Politics==
Montrose is a staunch Republican county. It has not been won by a Democratic presidential nominee since Lyndon Johnson‘s 1964 landslide – indeed since then, no Democrat has managed forty percent of the county&#x27;s vote. The county has leaned Republican ever since 1920; although before this, it did tend to vote Democratic between 1896 and 1916 except during the landslide loss of Alton B. Parker in 1904.














In other offices, Montrose also is strongly Republican. The last Democratic Senatorial candidate it backed was Ben Nighthorse Campbell, who later shifted to the Republican Party, in the 1992 election. Montrose County did back Constitution Party nominee Tom Tancredo in the 2010 gubernatorial election, and Bill Ritter did win 46 percent in 2006, but Roy Romer in 1990 remains the last Democratic candidate for governor to win Montrose County.

<doc id="96971" wikidata="Q1153883" url="?curid=96971" title="DirectDraw">
<text>DirectDraw (ddraw.dll) is an API that used to be a part of Microsoft&#x27;s DirectX API. DirectDraw is used to accelerate rendering of 2D graphics in applications. DirectDraw also allows applications to run fullscreen or embedded in a window such as most other MS Windows applications. DirectDraw uses hardware acceleration if it is available on the client&#x27;s computer. DirectDraw allows direct access to video memory, hardware overlays, hardware blitters, and page flipping. Its video memory manager can manipulate video memory with ease, taking full advantage of the blitting and color decompression capabilities of different types of display adapters.

Because DirectDraw is a 2D API, it contains commands for 2D rendering and does not support 3D hardware acceleration. A programmer could use DirectDraw to draw 3D graphics, but the rendering would be slow compared to an API such as Direct3D which does support 3D hardware acceleration.

DirectDraw was introduced for Windows Mobile in Windows Mobile 5.0, replacing the graphics component of GAPI, which was then deprecated.

With the release of DirectX version 8.0, DirectDraw was merged into a new package called DirectX Graphics, which extended Direct3D with a few DirectDraw API additions. DirectDraw can still be used by programmers, but they must use older DirectX interfaces (DirectX 7 and below).

In June 2010, DirectDraw was removed from the DirectX SDK package, but in 2012, the DirectX SDK was merged into the Windows Platform SDK, and DirectDraw was included once again.

== Replacement ==
There has been a deterioration of Windows compatibility with old games that rely upon DirectDraw, with &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;, &quot;Warcraft 2&quot;, and &quot;Theme Hospital&quot; among those affected. In newer Windows versions, some games will refuse to run under a 32-bit bit depth (&quot;Dangerous Waters&quot; for example), others showing a black screen or glitching when switched out. Re-implementation of DirectDraw has been observed to fix these compatibility problems. Commonly used replacements include:
* WineD3D from Wine, which translates into OpenGL.
* cnc-ddraw and ts-ddraw from CnCNet, a &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; multiplayer network. Translates into GDI, OpenGL (with GLSL support), or Direct3D 9.
* DDrawCompat, a wrapper for the vanilla ddraw that corrects problematic calls. ddwrapper is an earlier, unrelated wrapper that does the same thing.

<doc id="96972" wikidata="Q312497" url="?curid=96972" title="Montezuma County, Colorado">
<text>Montezuma County is a county located in the southwest corner of the U.S. state of Colorado. As of the 2020 census, the population was 25,849. The county seat is Cortez. Montezuma County contains many archaeologically significant Amerindian structures, which notably can be found in Mesa Verde National Park, Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, Yucca House National Monument, and Hovenweep National Monument. Montezuma County is also home to most of the Ute Mountain Indian Reservation, home of the Weeminuche Band of the Ute Nation, known as the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, with its headquarters at Towaoc.

==History==
Montezuma County has been settled since approximately AD 600, and had an estimated population of approximately 100,000, four times its current population, in the 12th century. However, a series of events caused virtually all permanent settlements to be abandoned between 1200 and 1300, and the area was contested between nomadic Ute and Navajo bands until resettlement occurred in the 1870s. Montezuma County was created out of the western portion of La Plata County by the Colorado Legislature in April 1889. It was named in honor of Moctezuma II, who reigned as emperor of the Aztec Empire in Mexico during its decline at the hands of the Spanish invasion. The building ruins in Mesa Verde National Park were thought to be of Aztec origin at the time.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water.

A large county, roughly 1/3 of its area is tribal land, 1/3 is federal land (administered by the National Park Service, the United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management), and 1/3 private or state/county land. It is also varied topographically, ranging in elevation from about to more than , and from high Colorado Plateau desert to alpine tundra. The county has the second largest reservoir in Colorado, McPhee Reservoir, many other large reservoirs, and hundreds of private lakes and ponds. Much of the county is irrigated cropland, and it produces fruit, large numbers of cattle and sheep, and beans. It is served by U.S. Highways 160 and 491 (formerly US 666), and by Cortez Municipal Airport. It has no rail service, although both Mancos and Dolores were established as railroad towns in the 1890s.

==Politics==
In its early history Montezuma County favored the Democratic Party. It was one of the few counties in the West to be won by Alton B. Parker in 1904, and along with neighboring La Plata County was one of only two Colorado counties to give a plurality to John W. Davis in the three-way 1924 election. However, since the 1940s Montezuma has been a strongly Republican county: no Democrat since 1968 has won over forty percent of the county&#x27;s vote in a Presidential election. Recently (July 28, 2020), the county government has openly endorsed viewpoints described as far-right by posting web links under a &quot;News&quot; banner on the official county web page. These links have since been removed after community members objected to partisan positions on the county website.












In gubernatorial elections, Montezuma County is also Republican-leaning: in 2010 it was along with neighboring Dolores County one of only two counties to give a plurality to Dan Maes. The last Democratic gubernatorial nominee to win Montezuma County was Roy Romer in 1990 when he carried all but four counties statewide. The last Democratic senatorial candidate to carry Montezuma County was Ben “Nighthorse” Campbell – later to switch to the Republican Party – in 1992.

Montezuma County is split between two house districts for the Colorado House of Representatives, House District 58 &amp; House District 59. Prior to the redistricting, which took effect in the November 2022 election, Montezuma County was solely in House District 58.

<text>Moffat County is a county located in the U.S. state of Colorado. As of the 2020 census, the population was 13,292. The county seat is Craig. With an area of 4,751 square miles, it is the second-largest county by area in Colorado, behind Las Animas County.

Moffat County comprises the Craig, CO, Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Steamboat Springs–Craig, CO, Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
=== Displacement of the Native people ===
The first recorded humans in northwestern Colorado were the Ute tribes. The Spanish expedition of Dominguez–Escalante of 1776 reached just south of what would be Moffat County and noted the area and inhabitants, but did not offer detailed information. In the early 1820s, William H. Ashley organized a major expedition of trappers into the Green River area of the county beginning the first use of the area&#x27;s resources by Europeans. John C. Freemont would lead the first organized exploration of Moffat County on his return from California during his second expedition. His party crossed into the future Moffat County on June 6, 1844.

Despite the encroachment by trappers, miners, and explorers, the Ute Treaty of 1868 (a.k.a. The Kit Carson Treaty) and the Brunot Treaty of 1873 identified northwestern Colorado as part of the Ute nation and &#x27;agencies&#x27; were established to act as representatives of the U.S. government within the Ute Nation. In 1879, a new agent, Nathan Meeker, was appointed to serve at the White River Agency in northwestern Colorado. Meeker had founded a Christian-based European agricultural colony in 1870 in eastern Colorado and had strong ideas of how a community should be structured. As the &quot;Indian Agent&quot; he felt compelled to change the nomadic lifestyle of the Ute Indians and attempted to &quot;civilize&quot; them by converting them into farmers. His efforts to impose an agricultural lifestyle on the native people created a conflict that ultimately led to the murder of Meeker and all of the staff at the Agency. The U.S. government&#x27;s reaction to the massacre resulted in the relocation of most of the Ute tribes to Utah by force. After the removal of the Ute tribes, the U.S. government opened up northwestern Colorado for mining, commercial cattle ranching, and homesteading.

=== Northwestern Colorado County reorganizations of territory/state ===
In 1861, the Colorado Territory was organized and northwestern Colorado became Summit County. In 1874, Grand County was created out of the northern half of Summit County, and in 1877, Grand County was further subdivided, creating Routt County. It would be another 34 years before Moffat County would be carved out of the western portion of Routt County. The county was named for David H. Moffat, a Colorado tycoon who died in 1911.

=== Development and growth ===
David Moffat had been the primary force driving the establishment of a railroad from Denver to Salt Lake City. He established the Denver, Northwestern &amp; Pacific Railway, and attempted to build a route from Denver to Salt Lake City. Construction on the &#x27;Moffat Road&#x27; track began in the early 1900s but it faced constant delays and challenges. It finally reached Moffat County in 1913, ending in the town of Craig. The railroad was important for cattle ranchers in Moffat County&#x27;s early years; however, the track was never extended into Utah. In 1934, another more direct route was established to Salt Lake City, and Moffat County remained a branch line and never part of the main commerce rail artery between Denver and Salt Lake City.

In the 1920s, U.S. 40, a major cross-country highway, began construction. The route selected put Moffat County, and the County Seat of Craig on the &#x27;Victory Highway&#x27; and almost exactly halfway between Denver and Salt Lake City. In 1938, the final section over the Rocky Mountains was completed and paved, with the exception of Rabbit Ears Pass in Routt County, which was paved by 1950. This expanded Craig&#x27;s economy by adding lodging and tourism. Moffat County was excluded from the initial Interstate Highway System plans as I-80 was routed through southern Wyoming and I-70 was planned to end in Denver and not cross the Rocky Mountains. Then Colorado Governor and former Moffat County resident, Edwin C. Johnson lobbied for I-70 to continue through Denver and connect to Salt Lake City. Eventually, the federal highway agency approved I-70 to continue through Colorado but routed it through Grand Junction, Colorado, leaving Moffat County as a secondary highway isolated between the two main east/west Interstate arteries.

The population in Moffat County stabilized at just over 5,000 people by the first census in 1920; however, it remained stagnant until the 1970s when construction of three coal-fired electrical power plants began. Those three plants are now scheduled to be closed in 2025, 2028, and 2030, respectively, creating a severe impact on the county&#x27;s economy. Beyond the energy industries, Moffat County&#x27;s ranching, agricultural, and tourism industries round out its primary economy. The 2020 census data showed the population at 13,292 people, which is almost the same as the county&#x27;s post-power plant boom in the 1980s.

==Politics==
Moffat is a Republican county in presidential elections. No Democratic presidential candidate has carried Moffat County since Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s 1964 landslide, and indeed no Democrat post-1964 has obtained even 40 percent of the county&#x27;s vote. Moffat was one of 15 counties (two in Colorado) to give a plurality to Ross Perot in the 1992 election, but every other Republican candidate since 1968 has obtained an absolute majority in Moffat County.











In gubernatorial elections, Moffat County has also generally been Republican, but was nonetheless carried by Democrat Roy Romer by a narrow margin in 1990 – when he carried all but four counties statewide – by Dick Lamm in 1982 and by Constitution Party candidate Tom Tancredo in 2010. In senatorial elections, the Republican candidate has consistently garnered over 60 percent of Moffat County voters since future party-switcher Ben Nighthorse Campbell won the county for the Democratic Party in 1992.
