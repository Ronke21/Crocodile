<text>The Fula, Fulani, or Fulɓe people are an ethnic group in Sahara, Sahel and West Africa, widely dispersed across the region. Inhabiting many countries, they live mainly in West Africa and northern parts of Central Africa, South Sudan, Darfur, and regions near the Red Sea coast in Sudan. The approximate number of Fula people is unknown, due to clashing definitions regarding Fula ethnicity. Various estimates put the figure between 25 and 40 million people worldwide.

A significant proportion of the Fula – a third, or an estimated 7 to 10 million – are pastoralists, and their ethnic group has the largest nomadic pastoral community in the world. The majority of the Fula ethnic group consisted of semi-sedentary people, as well as sedentary settled farmers, scholars, artisans, merchants, and nobility. As an ethnic group, they are bound together by the Fula language, their history and their culture. The Fula are almost completely Muslims with a tiny minority being Christians and Animists.

Many West African leaders are of Fulani descent, including the former President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari; the first president of Cameroon Ahmadou Ahidjo; the former President of Senegal, Macky Sall; the President and the vice president of Gambia, Adama Barrow and Muhammad B.S.Jallow; the President of Guinea-Bissau, Umaro Sissoco Embaló; the Vice President of Sierra Leone, Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh; the prime minister of Guinea conakry, Bah Oury; the Prime Minister of Mali, Boubou Cissé and the Wife of Vice President of Ghana Samira Bawumia. They also occupy positions in major international institutions, such as the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Amina J. Mohammed; the 74th President of the United Nations General Assembly, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande; and the Secretary-General of OPEC, Mohammed Sanusi Barkindo.

== Names ==

=== Ethnonyms ===
There are many names (and spellings of the names) used in other languages to refer to the &quot;Fulɓe&quot;. &quot;Fulani&quot; in English is borrowed from the Hausa term. &quot;Fula&quot;, from the Manding languages, is also used in English, and sometimes spelled &quot;Fulah&quot; or &quot;Fullah&quot;. Fula and Fulani are commonly used in English, including within Africa. The French borrowed the Wolof term &quot;Pël&quot;, which is variously spelled: &quot;Peul&quot;, &quot;Peulh&quot;, and even &quot;Peuhl&quot;. More recently the Fulfulde / Pulaar term &quot;Fulɓe&quot;, which is a plural noun (singular, &quot;Pullo&quot;) has been Anglicised as &quot;Fulbe&quot;, which is gaining popularity in use. In Portuguese, the terms Fula or Futafula are used. The terms &quot;Fallata&quot;, &quot;Fallatah&quot;, or &quot;Fellata&quot; are of Arabic origins, and are often the ethnonyms by which Fulani people are identified by in parts of Chad and Sudan.

The Toucouleur people of the central Senegal River valley speak Fulfulde / Pulaar and refer to themselves as &quot;Haalpulaaren&quot;, or those who speak Pulaar. The supposed distinction between them was invented by French ethnographers in the 19th century who differentiated between supposedly sedentary, agricultural, fanatical, and anti-European Toucouleurs on one hand and nomadic, pastoralist, docile and cooperative &quot;Peulhs&quot; on the other, but the dichotomy is false.

=== Surnames ===

==== Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Senegal ====
Common Fulani family names in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and Southern Senegal are: Diallo (French speaking regions), Jallow or Jalloh (English speaking regions), Djalo (Cap Verde and Guinea-Bissau), Sow, Barry, Bah or Ba, Baldé, and Diouldé. Other Fulani (Toucouleur) family names in Guinea and northern Senegal are: Tall, Sall, Diengue, Sy, Anne, Ly, Wann, Dia and others.

==== Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon ====
Although most Fulbe of Nigeria, Niger and Cameroon use their father&#x27;s given name as surnames, there are some common Fulani last names such as Bello (likely from the Fulfulde word &quot;Ballo&quot; meaning “helper or assistant”, this name is spread across several ethnic groups in Nigeria), Tukur (from Takrur), Gidado, Barkindo, Jallo, Ahidjo and Dikko.

==== Mali, Burkina Faso ====
In Mali, the most common Fulani family names are Diallo, Diakité, Dia, Sow, Sidibé, Sangaré, Bah, Dicko, Tall, etc. These names can be found among the Fulani populations of the following Malian regions and areas of Mopti, Macina, Nioro, Kidal, Tomboctou, Gao, Sikasso, and others. These names are also found among the Fula population of Burkina Faso, along with other names like Barry and Sankara (derived from Sangaré). 

Bocoum, Niangadou, Bassoum, Daff, Djigué, and Lah are some family names that can be found among the Diawambe/Jawambe (Singular: Dianwando/Jawando and Diokoramé/Jokorameh in Bambara) of Mali. The Jawambe are a sub-group of Fulanis in Mali who are primarily known for trading. 

In some parts of Mali, like Mopti, apart from the common Fula surnames like those previously mentioned, you will find surnames like Cissé and Touré. Though these names are commonly associated with the Manding tribes, some in Mali have adopted the Fula culture and language through centuries of coexistence, and thus now consider themselves as part of the Fula ethnic group. A notable example of this is Amadou Toumani Touré, the former president of Mali.

==Geographic distribution==
The Fula people are widely distributed, across the Sahel from the Atlantic coast to the Red Sea, particularly in West Africa. In addition, many also speak other languages of the countries they inhabit, making many Fulani bilingual or even trilingual. Such languages include French, Hausa, Bambara, Wolof, Soninke, and Arabic.

Major concentrations of Fulani people exist in the Fouta Djallon highlands of central Guinea and south into the northernmost reaches of Sierra Leone; the Futa Tooro savannah grasslands of Senegal and southern Mauritania; the Macina inland Niger river delta system around Central Mali; and especially in the regions around Mopti and the Nioro Du Sahel in the Kayes region; the Borgu settlements of Benin, Togo, and west-central Nigeria; the northern parts of Burkina Faso in the Sahel region&#x27;s provinces of Seno, Wadalan, and Soum; and the areas occupied by the Sokoto Caliphate, which includes what is now southern Niger and northern Nigeria (such as Adamawa, Tahoua, Katsina, Sokoto, Kebbi, Zinder, Bauchi, Diffa, Yobe, Gombe, and further east, into the Benue River valley systems of north eastern Nigeria and northern Cameroon).

This is the area known as the &quot;Fombina/Hombina&quot;, literally meaning &#x27;the south&#x27; in &quot;Adamawa Fulfulde&quot;, because it represented the most southern and eastern reaches of Fulɓe hegemonic dominance in West Africa. In this area, Fulfulde is the local lingua franca, and language of cross cultural communication. Further east of this area, Fulani communities become predominantly nomadic, and exist at less organized social systems. These are the areas of the Chari-Baguirmi region and its river systems, in Chad and the Central African Republic, the Ouaddaï highlands of Eastern Chad, the areas around Kordofan, Darfur and the Blue Nile, Sennar, Kassala regions of Sudan, as well as the Red Sea coastal city of Port Sudan. The Fulani on their way to or back from the pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, settled in many parts of eastern Sudan, today representing a distinct community of over two million people referred to as the &quot;Fellata&quot;.While their early settlements in West Africa were in the vicinity of the tri-border point of present-day Mali, Senegal, and Mauritania, they are now, after centuries of gradual migrations and conquests, spread throughout a wide band of West and Central Africa. The Fulani People occupy a vast geographical expanse located roughly in a longitudinal east–west band immediately south of the Sahara, and just north of the coastal rain forest and swamps. There are estimates of more than 25 million Fulani people.

There are generally three different types of Fulani based on settlement patterns, viz: the nomadic-pastoral or &quot;Mbororo&quot;, the semi-nomadic, and the settled or &quot;town&quot; Fulani. The pastoral Fulani move around with their cattle throughout the year. Typically, they do not stay around for long stretches (not more than 2–4 months at a time). The semi-nomadic Fulani can either be Fulɓe families who happen to settle down temporarily at particular times of the year or Fulɓe families who do not &quot;browse&quot; around past their immediate surroundings, and even though they possess livestock, they do not wander away from a fixed or settled homestead not too far away, they are basically &quot;in-betweeners&quot;.

Settled Fulani live in villages, towns, and cities permanently and have given up nomadic life completely, in favor of an urban one. These processes of settlement, concentration, and military conquest led to the existence of organized and long-established communities of Fulani, varying in size from small villages to towns. Today, some major Fulani towns include: Labé, Pita, Mamou, and Dalaba in Guinea; Kaedi, Matam and Podor, Kolda in Senegal and Mauritania; Bandiagara, Mopti, Dori, Gorom-Gorom, and Djibo in Mali and Burkina Faso, on the bend of the Niger; and Birnin Kebbi, Katsina, Gombe, Yola, Digil, Jalingo, Bauchi, Misau, 
Jama&#x27;are, Mayo Belwa, Mubi, Maroua, Ngaoundere, Azare ,Dukku, Kumo, Girei, Damaturu, Bertoua, and Garoua in the countries of Cameroon and Nigeria. In most of these communities, the Fulani are usually perceived as a ruling class.

Fulani communities are sometimes grouped and named based on the areas they occupy. Although within each region, there are even further divisions and sub-groupings as well. Below is a list of the main Fulɓe groups.

In Ghana, the exact number of Fulani is unknown due to systematic oppression that includes not counting the Fulani in the Ghanaian census. This reflects widespread discrimination and negative stereotypes about the Fulani.

== History ==
===Historiography===
The origins of the Fulani people are unclear and various theories have been postulated. As a nomadic herding people, they have moved through and among many cultures, making it difficult to trace their relationships and history with other peoples. Speculations about their origins started in the era of European conquest and colonization because of their oftentimes fair skin, wavy long hair and facial features.

Fulani oral histories suggest that their origins lie in North Africa. Their ethnogenesis likely arose as a result of interactions between an ancient West African population and North African populations such as Berbers or Egyptians.

The earliest mention of the Fula in history may go back to the Bible. Maurice Delafosse speculated that they may correspond to the descendants of Put, son of Ham. Josephus wrote of the Phutites, ancient inhabitants of what is now Libya.

===Early Kingdoms===
The precursors of the Fulani likely migrated out of the Sahara desert, at the time much wetter than today, as it progressively dried beginning in the 7th century BC. They migrated into the Senegal river valley from the east, pushed by Berber raids and desertification. The kingdom of Tekrur in what is now Futa Toro was formed through the interaction of the Fula (and perhaps Berber) migrants with the native &quot;Negro agricultural peoples&quot; of the valley who were &quot;essentially Serer&quot;, Dominated first by Wagadu and later by the Lamtuna, the Mali Empire and the Jolof Empire, in the early 16th century the area was conquered by Koli Tenguella, who founded the Empire of Great Fulo.

===Migration===

The Fulani were cattle-keeping farmers who shared their lands with other nearby groups, like the Soninke, who contributed to the rise of ancient Ghana, with eastward and westward expansion being led by nomadic groups of cattle breeders or the Fulɓe ladde. While the initial expansionist groups were small, they soon increased in size due to the availability of grazing lands in the Sahel and the lands that bordered it to the immediate south.Agricultural expansions led to a division among the Fulani, where individuals were classified as belonging either to the group of expansionist nomadic agriculturalists or the group of Fulani who found it more comfortable to abandon traditional nomadic ways and settle in towns or the Fulɓe Wuro. Fulani towns were a direct result of nomadic heritage and were often founded by individuals who had simply chosen to settle in a given area instead of continuing on their way.

Evidence of Fulani migration as a whole, from the Western to Eastern Sudan is very fragmentary. Delafosse, one of the earliest enquirers into Fulani history and customs, principally relying on oral tradition, estimated that Fulani migrants left Fuuta-Tooro heading east between the eleventh and the fourteenth centuries. By the 15th century, there was a steady flow of Fulɓe immigrants into Hausaland and, later on, Bornu. Their presence in Baghirmi was recorded early in the 16th century. By the end of the 18th century, Fulani settlements were dotted all along the Benue River valley and its tributaries. They spread eastwards towards Garoua and Rey Bouba, and southwards towards the Faro River, to the foot of the Mambilla Plateau, which they would later ascend in subsequent years. The heaviest concentrations of their settlements were at Gurin, Chamba territory, Cheboa, Turua and Bundang.

Today, Fula oral historians recognize three different &quot;Fuuta&quot;, or Fula lands: &quot;Fuuta Kingi&quot;, meaning &#x27;Old Fuuta&#x27;, encompassing the Tagant Plateau, the Assaba Region, the Hodh, Futa Toro and the area around Nioro du Sahel; &quot;Fuuta Keyri&quot;, &#x27;New Fuuta&#x27;, includes Futa Djallon, Massina, Sokoto, and the Adamawa Region; &quot;Fuuta Jula&quot; is the diaspora of Fula traders and emigrants in other regions.

===Islam and the Fula Jihads===
The Fula, living on the edge of the Sahara, were among the first sub-Saharan groups to adopt Islam. According to David Levison, adopting Islam made the Fulani feel a &quot;cultural and religious superiority to surrounding peoples, and that adoption became a major ethnic boundary marker&quot; between them and other African ethnic groups in the Sahel and West Africa.

Armed with horses and weapons from the north and inspired by Fula, Berber and Arab clerics, Fulani political units would play a central role in promoting Islam in West Africa through peaceful and violent means. These jihads targeted other ethnic groups but also other Fulani who had not yet adopted Islam or who follows it too loosely. These wars helped the Fula dominate much of the Sahel region of West Africa during the medieval and pre-colonial era, establishing them not only as a religious group but also as a political and economic force. From the 18th century onwards, the frequency of jihads increased and the Fulani became politically dominant in many areas.

While establishing their hegemony, the Fulbe defined a strict social hierarchy and imposed limitations on economic and trading activities, the purpose of which was to ensure a constant flow of tax revenue and commodities to the state apparatus and the standing army, especially for the cavalry. The freedom for pastoralists to move around was curtailed to ensure the smooth functioning of other production activities, such as cereal cultivation and, in the case of Maasina, of fishing activities. There was considerable resistance to the forced acceptance of Islam. Conversion to Islam meant not only changing one&#x27;s religion but also submitting to rules dealing with every aspect of social, political and cultural life, intrusions with which many nomadic Fulbe were not comfortable.

====Bundu====
In 1690, Torodbe cleric Malick Sy came to Bundu, in what is now eastern Senegal, from his home near Podor. Sy settled the lands with relatives from his native Futa Toro and Muslim immigrants from as far west as the Djolof Empire and as far east as Nioro du Sahel.

Under Sy, Bundu became a refuge for Muslims and Islamic scholars persecuted by traditional rulers in other kingdoms. Sy was killed in 1699 caught in an ambush by the army of Gajaaga. Still, Bundu&#x27;s growth that would set a precedent for later, larger, and more disruptive Fula jihads.

====Imamate of Futa Jallon====
The Emirate / Imamate of Timbo in the Fuuta Jallon developed from a revolt by Islamic Fulɓe against their oppression by the pagan Pulli (فُلِی or 𞤆𞤵𞤤𞥆𞤭, non-Islamic Fulɓe), and the Jallonke (the original Mande inhabitants of the Fuuta-Jallon), during the first half of the 18th century. The first ruler took the title of &quot;Almaami&quot; and resided in Timbo, near the modern-day town of Mamou. The town became the political capital of the newly formed Imamate, with the religious capital was located in Fugumba. The Council of Elders of the Futa Jallon state were also based in Fugumba, acting as a brake on the Almami&#x27;s powers.

The newly formed imamate was mostly located mainly in present-day Guinea, but also spanned parts of modern-day Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. This emirate was, in fact, a federal state of nine provinces: Timbo, Fugumbaa, Ɓuuriya, Koyin, Kollaaɗe, Keebaali, Labe, Fode-Hajji, and Timbi. After the Muslim Fulɓe victory, other ethnic groups who had resisted the jihad were deprived of their rights to land except for a small piece for their subsistence and were reduced to servitude. The nomad Pulli Fulɓe lost all freedom of movement, and thus, began to settle en-masse. The Jalonke lost their noble status and became slaves (&quot;maccuɓe&quot;).

Later, due to strife between two branches of the Seediayanke royal lineage, (the Soriya and the Alphaya), a system for the rotation of office between these branches was set up. This led to an almost permanent state of civil strife since none of the parties was inclined to respect the system, which considerably weakened the power of the political centre.

====Imamate of Futa Toro====
A jihad in Futa Toro between 1769 and 1776 led by Sulayman Bal threw out the ruling Denianke Dynasty. Sulayman died in 1776 and was succeeded by Abdul Kader (&#x27;Abd al-Qadir), a learned teacher and judge who had studied in Cayor.

Abdul Kader became the first &quot;Almamy&quot; of the theocratic Almamyate of Futa Toro. He encouraged construction of mosques, and pursued an aggressive policy towards his neighbors. The Torodbe prohibited the trade in slaves on the river. In 1785 they obtained an agreement from the French to stop trading in Muslim slaves and to pay customs duties to the state. Abdul Kader defeated the emirates of Trarza and Brakna to the north, but was defeated and captured when he attacked the Wolof states of Cayor and Waalo around 1797. After his release the jihad impetus had been lost. By the time of Abdul Kader&#x27;s death in 1806 the state was dominated by a few elite Torodbe families.

====Sokoto Caliphate and its various emirates====

The Sokoto Caliphate was by far the largest and most successful legacy of Fulani power in Western Africa. It was the largest, as well as the most well-organized, of the Fulani Jihad states. Throughout the 19th century, Sokoto was one of the largest and most powerful empires in West Africa until 1903, when defeated by European colonial forces. The Sokoto Caliphate included several emirates, the largest of which was Adamawa, although the Kano Emirate was the most populated. Others included, but are not limited to: Gombe Emirate, Gwandu Emirate, Bauchi Emirate, Katsina Emirate, Zazzau Emirate, Hadejia Emirate, and Muri Emirate.
====Empire of Massina====
The Maasina Emirate was established by the Fulbe jihad led by Seku Amadu in 1818, rebelling against the Bamana Empire, a political power that controlled the region from Segou. This jihad was inspired by Usman Dan Fodio and his jihad in Sokoto. This state appears to have had tight control over its core area, as evidenced by the fact that its political and economic organization is still manifested today in the organization of agricultural production in the Inland Delta. Despite its power and omnipresence, the hegemony of the emirate was constantly threatened. During the reign of Aamadu Aamadu, the grandson of Sheeku Aamadu, internal contradictions weakened the emirate until it fell to the Toucouleur in 1862.

====Toucouleur Empire====
The founder of the Toucouleur Empire, El Hadj Umar Tall, was an Islamic reformer originating from Fuuta Tooro. Beginning in Futa Jallon, he led an army that conquered Massina, Segou, and Kaarta, but he died fighting against rebels in 1864. At that point the emirate was divided into three states, each ruled by one of his sons. These three states had their capitals respectively in the towns of Nioro, Segou and Bandiagara. Within 30 years, all three had been conquered and colonized by the French.

===Timeline of Fulani history===


==Society==
The Fulani, migrant Arabs and Hausa people have taken some influences from each other&#x27;s cultures. Upon the success recorded in the 1804 Fulani War of Usman dan Fodio, many formerly nomadic Fulɓe subsequently joined the ruling classes of the many emirates of the Sokoto Caliphate. The Fulɓe of Hausaland dress in the clothing and speak the language of their Hausa neighbours (see Hausa–Fulani). Because they became the dominant ethnic group in these lands, the Fulɓe in the emirates outside Hausaland, like parts of Kanem-Bornu, Adamawa and Gombe, still retain much of their Fulani culture even still speaking Fulfulde as their first language. The Fulɓe who didn&#x27;t settle during this period and their descendants, however, still keep an obvious distinct identity from that of the Hausa and other surrounding groups of the region. This Hausa–Fulani interaction is uncommon outside the eastern subregion of West Africa.

In Mali, Burkina Faso and Senegal for instance, those within the Fulɓe cultural sphere, but who are not ethnically Fula, are referred to as &quot;yimɓe pulaaku&quot; (&quot;𞤴𞤭𞤥𞤩𞤫 𞤆𞤵𞤤𞤢𞥄𞤳𞤵&quot;, &quot;people of the Fula culture&quot;). As such, Fulani culture includes people who may or may not be ethnic Fulani. Although slavery is now illegal, memories of the past relationship between Fulɓbe and Rimayɓe are still very much alive in both groups. Paul Riesman, an American ethnographer who resided among the &quot;Jelgooji Fulɓbe&quot; of Burkina Faso in the 1980s, states that the Fulɓe are tall, slim, and light-skinned; they have thin straight noses, and their hair tends to be long and curly. In contrast, the Rimayɓe are stocky, tending towards corpulence, dark-skinned with flat &#x27;squashed&#x27; noses, and short kinky hair.

===Slavery and caste system===
The first Fulani people who were forcibly expatriated to America during the Atlantic slave trade came from several parts of West and Central Africa. Many Fulani slaves came from places such as Guinea, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Cameroon. Most of the slaves who came from Senegal belonged to Fula and Mandinga peoples. Some of the most common names found on the Registry of Liberated Africans were Fulani in origin. Many of the captors and perpetrators of raids providing sources for the European slave merchants were also Fulani.

Fula society features the caste divisions typical of the West African region. The fairly rigid caste system of the Fula people has medieval roots, had become well established by the 15th-century, and has survived into modern age. The four major castes, states Martin Kich, in their order of status are &quot;nobility, traders, tradesmen (such as blacksmith) and descendants of slaves&quot;. According to the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights, the Fulani people have held on to &quot;a strict caste system&quot;.

There are the Fulani proper, also referred to as the Fulɓe, including the Pullo (also called the Rimɓe (singular)) and the Dimo, meaning &quot;noble&quot;. There is the artisan caste, including blacksmiths, potters, griots, genealogists, woodworkers, and dressmakers. They belong to castes but are considered &quot;free people&quot;. Then there are those castes of captive, slave or serf ancestry: the Maccuɗo, Rimmayɓe, Dimaajo, and less often Ɓaleeɓe, the Fulani equivalent of the Tuareg Ikelan known as &quot;Bouzou&quot; (&quot;Buzu&quot;) or &quot;Bella&quot; in the Hausa and Songhay languages respectively. The Fulani rulers and merchants were, like many other ruling ethnic groups of Africa, also involved in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, sourcing the enslaved people through raids and from captives they took by waging war. Many Fulani were enslaved and raided by ethnic groups who adhered to traditional African religions.

The Fulani castes are endogamous in nature, meaning individuals marry only within their caste. This caste system, however, wasn&#x27;t as elaborate in places like northern Nigeria, Eastern Niger or Cameroon. According to some estimates, by the late 19th century, slaves constituted about 50% of the population of the Fulɓe-ruled Adamawa Emirate, where they were referred to as &quot;jeyaɓe&quot; (singular &quot;jeyado&quot;). Though very high, these figures are representative of many other emirates of the Sokoto Caliphate, of which Adamawa formed a part. The castes-based social stratification among the Fula people was widespread and seen across the Sahel, such as Burkina Faso, Niger, Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Nigeria, Sudan, and others.

==Culture==
===Traditional livelihood===
The Fulani are traditionally a nomadic, pastoralist trading people. They herd cattle, goats and sheep across the vast dry hinterlands of their domain, keeping somewhat separate from the local agricultural populations. They are the largest nomadic ethnic group in the world and inhabit several territories over an area larger in size than the continental United States. The pastoral lifestyle of the herders&#x27; tribe makes it complicated for a non-member to date or marry a Fulani woman.

The Fulani follow a code of behaviour known as &quot;pulaaku&quot;, which consists of the qualities of patience, self-control, discipline, prudence, modesty, respect for others (including foes), wisdom, forethought, personal responsibility, hospitality, courage, and hard work. Among the nomadic Fulani, women in their spare time make handicrafts including engraved gourds, weavings, knitting, beautifully made covers for calabashes known as mbeedu, and baskets. The Fulani men are less involved in the production of crafts such as pottery, iron-working, and dyeing, unlike males from neighbouring ethnic groups around them.

In virtually every area of West Africa, where the nomadic Fulɓe reside, there has been an increasing trend of conflicts between farmers (sedentary) and grazier (pastoral nomadic). There have been numerous such cases on the Jos Plateau, the Western High Plateau, the Central/Middle Belt regions of Nigeria, Northern Burkina Faso, and Southern Chad. The rearing of cattle is a principal activity in four of Cameroon&#x27;s ten administrative regions as well as three other provinces with herding on a lesser scale, throughout the North and Central regions of Nigeria, as well as the entire Sahel and Sudan region.

For decades there have been intermittent skirmishes between the Woɗaaɓe &quot;Bororo&quot; (graziers) and sedentary farmers such as the Jukun, Tiv, Chamba, Bamileke, Wurkum, Bachama, Jenjo, Mbula, Berom, Mumuye, Kare Kare, and sometimes even the Hausa. Such conflicts usually begin when cattle have strayed into farmlands and destroyed crops. Thousands of Fulani have been forced to migrate from their traditional homelands in the Sahel, to areas further south, because of increasing encroachment of Saharan desertification. Nigeria alone loses of cattle rangeland and cropland every year to desertification, posing serious threats to the livelihoods of about 20 million people.

Recurrent droughts have meant that a lot of traditional herding families have been forced to give up their nomadic way of life, losing a sense of their identity in the process. Increasing urbanization has also meant that a lot of traditional Fulani grazing lands have been taken for developmental purposes, or forcefully converted into farmlands. These actions often result in violent attacks and reprisal counterattacks being exchanged between the Fulani, who feel their way of life and survival are being threatened, and other populations who often feel aggrieved from loss of farm produce even if the lands they farm on were initially barren and uncultivated.
Fulani in Nigeria have often requested for the development of exclusive grazing reserves, to curb conflicts. All the leading presidential aspirants of previous elections seeking Fulɓe votes have made several of such failed promises in their campaigns. Discussions among government officials, traditional rulers, and Fulani leaders on the welfare of the pastoralists have always centred on requests and pledges for protecting grazing spaces and cattle passages. The growing pressure from Ardo&#x27;en (the Fulani community leaders) for the salvation of what is left of the customary grazing land has caused some state governments with large populations of herders (such as Gombe, Bauchi, Adamawa, Taraba, Plateau, and Kaduna) to include in their development plans the reactivation and preservation of grazing reserves. Quick to grasp the desperation of cattle-keepers for land, the administrators have instituted a Grazing Reserve Committee to find a lasting solution to the rapid depletion of grazing land resources in Nigeria.

The Fulani believe that the expansion of the grazing reserves will boost livestock population, lessen the difficulty of herding, reduce seasonal migration, and enhance the interaction among farmers, pastoralists, and rural dwellers. Despite these expectations, grazing reserves are not within the reach of about three-quarters of the nomadic Fulani in Nigeria, who number in the millions, and about sixty per cent of migrant pastoralists who use the existing grazing reserves keep to the same reserves every year. The number and the distribution of the grazing reserves in Nigeria range from insufficient to severely insufficient for Fulani livestock. In countries like Nigeria, Cameroon, and Burkina Faso where some cow supplies are dependent on the Fulani, such conflicts lead to hikes in beef prices. In recent times, the Nigerian senate and other lawmakers have been bitterly divided in attempts to pass bills on grazing lands and migration &quot;corridors&quot; for Fulani Herdsmen. This was mainly due to Southern and Central Nigerian lawmakers opposing the proposal, and Northern Lawmakers being in support. Fulani extremists are involved in herder-farmer conflicts in Nigeria. According to the Global Terrorism Index, a continuous sequence of Fulani attacks across West Africa have occurred in Mali, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Cameroon. The cumulative fatalities in these attacks is in the thousands.

===Language===

The language of the Fulani is &quot;Pulaar&quot; 𞤆𞤵𞤤𞤢𞥄𞤪, which is also the language of the Toucouleurs. All Senegalese and Mauritanians who speak the language natively are known as the &quot;&quot; (𞤖𞤢𞤤𞤨𞤵𞤤𞤢𞥄𞤪) or &quot;Haalpulaar&#x27;en&quot; (𞤖𞤢𞥄𞤤𞤵𞤤𞤢𞥄𞤪𞥇𞤫𞤲), which means &quot;speakers of Pulaar&quot; (&quot;hal&quot; is the root of the Pulaar verb &quot;haalugol&quot; 𞤖𞤢𞥄𞤤𞤵𞤺𞤮𞤤, meaning &quot;to speak&quot;). In some areas, e.g. in northern Cameroon, Fulfulde is a local lingua franca.

There are three writing systems used to write this language: an Arabic derived one called Ajami, a Latin derived system with 6 sets, and a native phonetic-faithful system called Adlam recently invented in 1989; the third one is the most increasingly popular not only learnt by hundreds of thousands of people among the diaspora worldwide but has also apps and computer programs created to assist in the script&#x27;s adoption.

===Moral code===
Central to the Fulani people&#x27;s lifestyle is a code of behavior known as &quot;pulaaku&quot; (Fulfulde: 𞤆𞤵𞤤𞤢𞥄𞤳𞤵) or &quot;laawol Fulɓe&quot; (𞤂𞤢𞥄𞤱𞤮𞤤 𞤆𞤵𞤤𞤩𞤫) literally meaning the &quot;Fulani pathways&quot; which are passed on by each generation as high moral values of the Fulbe, which enable them to maintain their identity across boundaries and changes of lifestyle. Essentially viewed as what makes a person Fulani, or &quot;Fulaniness&quot;, &quot;pulaaku&quot; includes:

* &quot;Munyal&quot;: Patience, self-control, discipline, prudence
* &quot;Gacce&quot; / &quot;Semteende&quot;: Modesty, respect for others (including foes)
* &quot;Hakkille&quot;: Wisdom, forethought, personal responsibility, hospitality
* &quot;Sagata&quot; / &quot;Tiinaade&quot;: Courage, hard work

===Dress===

There are no particular outfits for all Fulani sub-groups; dressing and clothing accessories such as ornaments mostly depend on the particular region. The traditional dress of the Fulbe Wodaabe consists of long colourful flowing robes, modestly embroidered or otherwise decorated. In the Futa Jallon highlands of central Guinea, it is common to see men wearing a distinctive hat with colorful embroidery. In Nigeria, Cameroon and Niger, men wear a hat that tapers off at three angular tips, known as a &quot;noppiire&quot;. Both men and women wear a characteristic white or black cotton fabric gown, adorned with intricate blue, red and green thread embroidery work, with styles differing according to region and sex. 

It is not uncommon to see the women decorate their hair with bead hair accessories as well as cowrie shells. Fula women often use henna for hand, arm and feet decorations. Their long hair is put into five long braids that either hang or are sometimes looped on the sides. It is common for women and girls to have silver coins and amber attached to their braids. Some of these coins are very old and have been passed down in the family. The women often wear many bracelets on their wrists. The women can also be seen wearing a colorful cloth (&quot;modjaare&quot;) around, the waist, head or over one shoulder.

Like the men, the women have markings on their faces around their eyes and mouths that they were given as children. The Western Fulbe in countries like Mali, Senegal and Mauritania use indigo inks around the mouth, resulting in a blackening around the lips and gums.

Fulani men are often seen wearing solid-colored shirt and pants which go down to their lower calves, made from locally grown cotton, a long cloth wrapped around their faces, and a conical hat made from straw and leather on their turbans, and carrying their walking sticks across their shoulders with their arms resting on top of it. Often the men have markings on either side of their faces and/or on their foreheads. They received these markings as children. Fula ethics are strictly governed by the notion of &quot;pulaaku&quot;. Women wear long robes with flowery shawls. They decorate themselves with necklaces, earrings, nose rings and anklets.

===Herding===
Fula are primarily known to be pastoralists, but are also traders in some areas. Most Fula in the countryside spend long times alone on foot, and can be seen frequently parading with their cattle throughout the west African hinterland, moving their herds in search of water and better pasture. They were, and still are, the only major migratory people group of West Africa, although the Tuareg people, another nomadic tribe of North African origin, live just immediately north of Fula territory, and sometimes live alongside the Fulani in countries such as Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. The Fulani, as a result of their constant wandering of the past, can be seen in every climatic zone and habitat of West Africa, from the deserts of the north, to the derived savannah and forests of the south.

From the 16th to 20th centuries many Fulani communities settled in the highlands of the Jos Plateau, the Western High Plateau of Bamenda, and Adamawa Plateau of Nigeria and the Cameroons. These are the highest elevated places in West Africa, and their altitude can reach up to 8,700 feet above sea level. The highland plateaus have a more temperate climate conducive for cattle herding activities, which allowed Fulbe populations to settle there in waves of migrations from further west. Though most Fula now live in towns or villages, a large proportion of the population is still either fully nomadic, or semi-nomadic in nature.

Wealth is counted by how large the herd of cattle is. Long ago Fulani tribes and clans used to fight over cattle and grazing rights. Being the most treasured animal that the Fulanis herd, the cows are very special. Many people say that a person cannot speak Fulfulde if he does not own a cow. The Fulani have a tradition of giving a &quot;habbanaya&quot; – a cow which is loaned to another until she calves. Once the calf is weaned it is retained and the cow is returned to its owner. This habbanaya is a highly prized animal. Upon receipt of this gift, there is a special ceremony in honor of the gift. The recipient buys special treats and invites his neighbors for this event in which the habbanaya is given a name. The habbanaya is never to be struck under any circumstance.
Fulani nomads keep various species of cattle, but the zebu is the most common in the West African hinterland, due to its drought resistant traits. In the wetter areas of Fouta Djallon and Casamance, the dwarf N&#x27;Dama is more common, as they are highly resistant to trypanosomiasis and other conditions directly associated with high humidity. Subspecies of zebu include the White Fulani cattle, locally known as the Aku, Akuji, Bororoji, White Kano, Yakanaji or Bunaji, which are an important beef breed of cattle found throughout the area owned by both Fulani and Hausa people and beyond in the Sahel zone of Africa.

The Red Fulani cattle, which are called the Jafun in Nigeria and Cameroon, and Fellata in Chad, as well as other names such as the M&#x27;Bororo, Red Bororo, or Bodaadi, another subspecies is the &quot;Sokoto Gudali&quot; and the &quot;Adamawa Gudali&quot; or simply &quot;Gudali&quot;, which means &quot;horned and short legged&quot; in the Hausa language. The widely accepted theory for the origin of present-day zebu cattle in West Africa is that they came from the westward spread of the early zebu populations in East Africa through the Sudan. Other breeds of zebu are found mainly in the drier regions. Their body conformation resembles the zebu cattle of eastern Africa. The zebu did not appear in West Africa until about 1800. The increasing aridity of the climate and the deterioration of the environment in the Sahel appear to have favoured the introduction and spread of the zebu, as they are superior to longhorn and shorthorn cattle in withstanding drought conditions.

The origins and classification of the Fulani remains controversial; one school of thought is of the opinion that the Fulani cattle are truly long-horned zebus that first arrived in Africa from Asia on the east coast; these are believed to have been introduced into West Africa by Arab invaders during the seventh century, roughly about the same time that the short-horned zebus arrived into East Africa. This theory is supported by the appearance of the skull as well as the thoracic hump of the Fulani cattle.

Another school of thought contends that these cattle originated from the Horn of Africa, present-day Ethiopia and Somalia, and that interbreeding between the short-horned zebu (which arrived in the Horn around the first millennium BC) and the ancient Hamitic Longhorn and/or &quot;B. taurus brachyceros&quot; shorthorn (which had arrived much earlier) occurred in the Horn about 2000–1500 BCE. The subsequent successive introductions of the short-horned zebu are believed to have displaced most sanga cattle into southern Africa.
During this period of constant movement of people and animals within Africa, some of these sanga cattle probably intermixed with the short-horned, thoracic-humped cattle to produce the thoracic-humped sanga. The latter may have migrated, most probably along with the spread of Islam, westerly to constitute what are today the lyre-horned cattle of West and Central Africa, including the Fulani cattle. Originally the White Fulani were indigenous to north Nigeria, southeast Niger and northeast Cameroon, owned by both Fulani and Hausa people. They then spread to southern Chad and western Sudan.

Every year, in the Malian town of Diafarabé, Fulani men cross the Niger River with their cattle, in an annual cycle of transhumance. This annual festival is known in the local Fulfulde as the &quot;Dewgal&quot;. Since the founding of the village in 1818, it has always been the most important Fulani festival. It takes place on a Saturday in November or December; the day is carefully chosen based on the state of pastures and the water levels in the river Niger. During the rainy season, the river swells, and the areas around the village are inundated in water, as the level of the river Niger rises, and turns Diafarabe into an island. The cattle are kept on the lush fields up north or south, but when the West African Monsoon subsides and the drier season returns, the water level drops and the cattle can return home again.

The crossing is more than a search for pastures; it is also a competition to show craftsmanship as a herdsmen. The cattle are driven into the river, and each herder, with no help from others, loudly encourages the animals to move forward as he stands or swims between them, holding on to the horns of the bulls. The smaller animals don&#x27;t have to swim, but are lifted into pirogues. When all the cattle are back, they are judged by a panel, which decides whose animals are the &quot;fattest&quot;. That herder is awarded &quot;best caretaker&quot;, and he is awarded by the community. The worst caretaker ends up with a shameful &quot;prize&quot; – a peanut.

Besides being a competition of herdsmanship, it is also a social event; the herdsmen return after having been away for the most part of the year and they meet their family and friends again. It is a time for celebration. The women decorate their house with woven mats and paint the floor with white and black clay, braid their hair with very intricate patterns, and dress up for their husbands and loved ones. Impressed by the cultural significance attached to the annual event, UNESCO included it on its list of world cultural heritage events.

===Music===

The Fula have a rich musical culture and play a variety of traditional instruments including drums, &quot;hoddu&quot; (a plucked skin-covered lute similar to a banjo), and &quot;riti&quot; or &quot;riiti&quot; (a one-string bowed instrument similar to a violin), in addition to vocal music. The well-known Senegalese Fula musician Baaba Maal sings in Pulaar on his recordings. &quot;Zaghareet&quot; or ululation is a popular form of vocal music formed by rapidly moving the tongue sideways and making a sharp, high sound.

Fulani music is as varied as its people. The numerous sub-groups all maintain unique repertoires of music and dance. Songs and dances reflect traditional life and are specifically designed for each individual occasion. Music is played at any occasion: when herding cattle, working in the fields, preparing food, or at the temple. Music is extremely important to the village life cycle, with field cultivation, harvest and winnowing of millet performed to the rhythm of the songs and drums.

Fulani herders have a special affinity for the flute and violin &quot;nianioru&quot;. The young Fulani shepherd like to whistle and sing softly as they wander the silent savannah with cattle and goats. The truly Fulani instruments are the one-string viola of the Fulani (nianioru), the flute, the two to five string lute &quot;hoddu&quot; or &quot;molo&quot;, and the &quot;buuba&quot; and &quot;bawdi&quot; set of drums. But they are also influenced by the other instruments of the region such as the beautiful West African harp, the kora, and the balafon. Entertainment is the role of certain casts. The performance of music is the realm of specialized casts. The Griots or &quot;Awlube&quot; recite the history of the people, places and events of the community.

===Food===

 can be the general term for both fresh milk and yoghurt known as in Fulfulde. It is central to Fulbe identity and revered as a drink or in one of its various processed forms, such as yoghurt and cheese. and are derived from milk fat, are used in light cooking and hair weaving. It is common to see Fulani women hawking milk products in characteristic beautifully decorated calabashes balanced on their heads. Other meals include a heavy porridge () made of flour from such grains as millet, sorghum, or corn which is eaten in combination with soup (, ) made from tomatoes, onions, spices, peppers, and other vegetables. Also, in addition to rice, which is a staple crop for the Fulani people, their main vegetables and staples are yams, corn, beans, and red pepper. The Fulani people eat cassava roots and fruits like plantains as well.

Another popular meal eaten by almost all Fulani communities is made from fermenting milk into yoghurt and eaten with corn couscous known as or , either in the same bowl or separately, also a fluid or porridge called made of flour cereals such as millet, sorghum or corn and milk. The Wodaabe traditionally eat millet, milk and meat as staples. Millet is eaten in the morning, noon and night as a grease with a sauce or stew which usually contains tomatoes, peppers, bone, meat, onion, and other vegetables. On special occasions they eat meat such as goat or beef. A thick beverage similar to the Tuareg is made by pounding goat cheese, milk, dates and millet.

=== Ceramics ===
The Fulani people are not as engaged in artistic endeavors like ceramics and pottery as other nearby cultures because they feel that these pursuits &quot;violate their code of conduct and bring shame upon them&quot;. That being said, the Fulani women do produce handicrafts including knitting, weaving, and basketry. Seldom do Fulani men work in crafts.

===Houses===

Traditionally, nomadic Fula live in domed houses known as a &quot;Bukkaru&quot; or &quot;suudu hudo&quot;, literally &quot;grass house&quot;. During the dry season, the characteristically hemisphere-shaped domed houses are supported by compact millet stalk pillars, and by reed mats held together and tied against wood poles, in the wet or rainy season. These mobile houses are very easy to set up, and dismantle, as typical of houses from nomadic societies. When it is time to move, the houses are easily disassembled and loaded onto donkeys, horses or camels for transport. With recent trends however, many Fula now live in mud or concrete block houses.

Once they are set up, the room is divided into a sleeping compartment, and another compartment where calabashes and guards of all sizes are intricately arranged in a stack according to their sizes and functions. Spoons made from gourda are hung from the rooftop, with others meant for grain storage.

=== Religion ===
The Fula were one of the first ethnic groups in Sub-Saharan Africa to convert to Islam, maintaining it as an intrinsic part of their cultural identity, although in some cases elements of traditional African faiths are mixed in a predominantly Muslim religious syncretism. The vast majority of Fula people are Muslims, with some religious minorities — largely Fula Christians, a small minority group (1-2%) present in parts of northern Nigeria. Nearly all Fula Christians are recent converts from Islam, or descendants of recent converts. The group faces severe persecution from both Fulani Muslims due to their faith and other Nigerian Christians due to their ethnicity.

== Rites of passage in the Fulani kingdom ==
=== Marriage ===
In the Fulani society, marriage is considered endogamy rather than exogamy. Marriage is permitted amongst people of the same lineage. Marriage is generally between cross-cousins and parallel cousins. Even before their birth, the children were betrothed. The caste system and political stratification have a role in their conventional marriage. Marriage exists to maintain wealth and the royal dynasty. They practice early marriage, which is typically arranged by relatives. The men marry in their twenties, while the women marry in their teens. A man is permitted to marry more than one woman so long as he can meet his wives&#x27; requirements equally.

The traditional Fulani marriage system consists of three phases: the Kabbal, Koowgal, and Sharo stages.

The Sharo
In this stage of the marriage process, the man is publicly flogged by other guys in this particular flogging procedure. This is to assess his strength, discipline, and bravery. If the prospective groom cries, the bride&#x27;s family may reject him and view him as a coward. Not every ethnic group adheres to this tradition. The groom&#x27;s people support him during the painful flogging process.

==Genetics==

The Fulani people are genetically an admixture of West and East African ancestries, specifically Niger-Congo and Nilo-Saharan components, but also display varying degrees of West Eurasian admixture through contact with groups from North Africa. The Fulani are the most wide-spread pastoralist group in the Sahel/Savannah belt.

=== Paternal lineages (Y-DNA) ===
The paternal lineages of the Fula/Fulɓe/Fulani tend to vary depending on geographic location. According to a study by Cruciani et al. (2002), around 90% of Fulani individuals from Burkina Faso carried haplotype 24, which corresponds with the E-M2 (E1b1a) that is common in West Africa. The remainder belonged to haplotype 42/haplogroup E-M132. Both of these clades are today most frequent among Niger–Congo-speaking populations, particularly those inhabiting Senegal. Similarly, 53% of the Fulani in northern Cameroon bore haplogroup E-M132, with the rest mainly carrying other African clades (12% haplogroup A and 6% haplogroup E1b1a). A significant minority carried the West Eurasian haplogroups T (18%) and R1 (12%), making up together around ~30% of the total haplogroup variation. Mulcare et al. (2004) observed a similar frequency of haplogroup R1 subclades in their Fulani samples from Cameroon (18%).

A study by Hassan et al. (2008) on a Fulani subgroup in Sudan observed a significantly higher occurrence of the West-Eurasian haplogroup R1 (53.8%). The remainder belonged to E-M215 subclades, including 34.62% E-M78 and 27.2% E-V22. Bučková et al. (2013) analyzed various Fulani subgroups, and observed R1b among the Fulani Zinder grouping with a frequency of ~31%. This was in sharp contrast to most of the other Fulani pastoralist groups elsewhere, including those from Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Mali and Chad, which instead had nearly exclusive West African paternal haplogroups.

===Maternal lineages (mtDNA)===

A study of four Fulani nomad populations (n = 186) in three Sahelian countries (Chad, Cameroon, and Burkina Faso), found that the only group of nomadic Fulani that manifests some similarities with geographically related agricultural populations (from Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria) comes from Tcheboua in northern Cameroon.

===Autosomal DNA (overall)===
According to Tishkoff et al. (2009), the Fulani&#x27;s genomic ancestry clusters near that of Chadic and Central Sudanic speaking populations, with genetic affinities observed to the Hausa people. Based on this, the researchers suggest that the Fulani may have adopted a Niger-Congo language at some point in their history, while intermarrying with local populations. Additionally, moderate levels of West Eurasian admixture was also observed among the Fulani samples, which the authors propose may have been introduced via the Iberian Peninsula and Northern Africa. Dobon et al. (2015), found that the Sudanese Fulani have largely ancestry from Niger-Kordofanian and Nilo-Saharan (Sudanic) speaking groups, with lower amounts of West-Eurasian ancestry.

Triska, Petr et al. (2015) showed that there is extensive admixture across the Sahel Belt, with the Fula carrying West African and East African components, as well as a Mozabite/North African component. These results support the hypothesis of a North African origin and a Western to Central Africa past migration for Fulani.

A full genome analysis was conducted by Vicente et al. in 2019, analyzing several different Fulani subgroups from various geographic regions. They found that the Fulani people are characterized by the admixture of local West African and East African components, but also display West-Eurasian admixture, mediated through historical North African groups. The West-Eurasian ancestry among Fulani was estimated to a mean average of 21,4% among the 53 samples from Ziniaré in Burkina Faso. According to the authors, there were two admixture events, the first being about 2000 years ago, with the second being more recent at around 300 years ago. This Eurasian ancestry was observed in the ancestry components of Mozabite people. They found that: &quot;Our findings suggest that Eurasian admixture and the European LP allele was introduced into the Fulani through contact with a North African population/s. We furthermore confirm the link between the lactose digestion phenotype in the Fulani to the MCM6/LCT locus by reporting the first GWAS of the lactase persistence trait. e observed a T-13910 allele frequency of 48.0%, while the genome-wide European admixture fraction in the Fulani is 21.4% at K = 3. The notable European admixture fraction in the Fulani coupled with the high frequencies of the LP T-13910 allele suggests the possibility of adaptive gene flow into the Fulani gene pool&quot;. Another study in 2020 by Priehodová et al., suggest an older date for the introduction of one variant of the LP allele in the Sahel, about ~8.5 ka.

A study in 2019 by Fan et al., found that the Fulani sampled from Cameroon, clustered with Afro-Asiatic speakers from East Africa in the phylogenetic analysis, which the authors said indicates a potential shift in language to Niger-Congo. The analysis on autosomal markers found traces of West Eurasian-related ancestry in this population, which suggests a North African or East African origin (as North and East Africans also have such ancestry likely related to expansions of farmers and herders from the Near East) and is consistent with the presence at moderate frequency of the −13,910T variant associated with lactose tolerance in European populations.

In 2020, a study inferred that the Fulani of western Cameroon have 48% Mende-related, 23% East African-related, and 29% non-African-related ancestry.

In 2023, whole genomes of Fulani individuals from various Sahelian samples were analyzed, and the researches said the non-Sub-Saharan genetic ancestry within the Fulani cannot be solely explained by recent admixture events. Fulani may be descendants of Saharan cattle herders during the last Green Sahara, who had some genomic similarities to Late Neolithic Moroccans based on ancient samples.

Another 2023 study inferred that &quot;The Fulani derived 50% of their ancestry from a population related to the Amhara and 50% from a population related to the Tikari (consistent with TreeMix results with 3 migration events).&quot;

<text>San Anselmo () is an incorporated town in Marin County, California, United States. San Anselmo is located west of San Rafael, at an elevation of . It is located about north of San Francisco. The town is bordered by San Rafael to the east, Fairfax to the west, and Ross to the south. Mount Tamalpais dominates the view to the south. The population was 12,830 at the 2020 census.

==History==

=== Early history ===
San Anselmo sits on Costal Miwok land which was inhabited prior to American and Spanish settlers. The land in and around San Anselmo was mostly pastoral until 1874, when the North Pacific Coast Railroad (NPC) added to its line a spur track from San Anselmo to San Rafael. In 1875, the railroad completed a line from Sausalito to Tomales and north to Cazadero via San Anselmo. For a few years, the town was listed on railroad maps as &quot;Junction&quot;, but in 1883 the name San Anselmo came back into use. The San Anselmo post office opened in 1892. Two postal substations were operated: Lansdale, from 1924 to 1962, and Yolanda, from 1924 to 1954.
From 1902 until the early 1940s, San Anselmo was part of Marin&#x27;s Northwestern Pacific (in 1907, investors formed the NWP) Electric Train system. The Miracle Mile&#x27;s and Center Boulevard&#x27;s current &quot;raised roadbed&quot; were the railroad&#x27;s right of way.
Becoming unprofitable as a result of competition from the automobile and the opening of the Golden Gate Bridge, the railway was officially closed on March 1, 1941. The last of the major San Anselmo railroad station buildings was razed in 1963.

The population of San Anselmo increased after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Wealthy individuals displaced from San Francisco moved to their summer homes in San Anselmo, making them their permanent residences.

The 1913 electric train schedule shows a commute time from San Anselmo to the Sausalito Ferry to the Ferry Building in San Francisco of a mere 58 minutes, including the 32-minute ferry transit.

San Anselmo incorporated on April 9, 1907. Its name came from the Punta de Quintin land grant, which marked the valley as the Canada del Anselmo, or Valley of Anselm, &quot;Anselm&quot; being the name of a Native American who was buried in the area. San Anselmo was a silent film capital in the early 1900s.

=== World War II ===

==== Sleepy Hollow ammunition storage ====
During World War II, the Army based a small ammunition storage dump, known as ASP #2, about up Butterfield Road from Sir Francis Drake Blvd. The facility was located between the road and San Anselmo Creek and had 23 to 45 men stationed there.
There were two batteries composed of four-inch antiaircraft cannon manned by five soldiers on a 24-hour basis. One battery was on Stuyvesant Drive and the other on Oak Springs Hill.
During the war, the Sleepy Hollow Country Club, located in the old Hotaling mansion, was still open and provided a pleasant break from &quot;grueling&quot; guard duty, according to those stationed at the ammo dump.

====Air raid wardens====
During World War II, air raid wardens, like Zinnia and Alfred Heiden of San Francisco Blvd., patrolled their assigned neighborhood during nighttime air raid drills to notify neighbors of any light that shone out of their houses. Windows were covered with cloth or thick paper during the war to deny enemy bombers illuminated nighttime bombing targets.

====Pilot training accidents====
In the late afternoon of November 2, 1941, five weeks before the US entered the war, San Anselmo residents were startled when two low-flying Curtiss P-40 warplanes roared up the valley at just above roof level and crashed into the east side of Bald Hill (often incorrectly reported as Mount Baldy or Bald Mountain) at 5:40 pm.

Element leader Lt. Thomas &quot;Bud&quot; L. Truax and Lt. Russell E. Speckman were killed when their planes crashed, in low visibility, into Bald Hill, just shy of the peak. It was almost dark, was misty and they were under a low cloud ceiling. They were critically low on fuel and part of a larger training group that had gotten separated. They were under the wintertime marine layer of low clouds that are common in the Marin County area, searching for nearby Hamilton Field to land. Truax Field / Dane County Regional Airport, located in Madison, Wisconsin, was named in memory of Lt. Truax.

A third pilot, Lt. Walter V. &quot;Ramblin&quot; Radovich, had left the formation over San Rafael, almost hit the city courthouse on 4th Street, circled the Forbes Hill radio beacon (37°58&#x27;44.73&quot;N,122°32&#x27;50.78&quot;W), clipped a tree and then turned northeast, towards Hamilton Field. Unsure of what the oncoming terrain would be and critically low on fuel, he decided to climb up though the typically thin marine cloud layer to , trim the airplane for straight and level flight and bail out. According to USAAF accident reports, his left leg was broken when exiting the plane and he parachuted down, landing near Highway 101 in Lucas Valley, reportedly near where Fireman&#x27;s Fund / Marin Commons is currently located (38° 1&#x27;10.66&quot;N, 122°32&#x27;29.36&quot;W). Ironically, after Lt. Radovich bailed out, the airplane slowly descended back down through the clouds and made a relatively smooth &quot;gear-up&quot; landing.

=== Post-WWII ===
On March 12, 1974, San Anselmo officially became a town. In 1963, a cast iron statue of a deer affectionately known as &quot;Sugarfoot&quot; by locals was donated to the town by Joeseph Dondero. This statue still stands today and children enjoy riding on his back after trips to the library next door.

The town features in the song &quot;Snow in San Anselmo&quot; by Irish-born singer/songwriter Van Morrison, about an unusual bout of winter weather that occurred when he was living in Fairfax, near San Anselmo, in the 1970s.

San Anselmo&#x27;s most prominent resident, movie director George Lucas, used some of the proceeds from his film &quot;American Graffiti&quot; to buy an old Victorian house in San Anselmo; his then-wife Marcia Lucas named it &quot;Parkhouse.&quot; Lucas worked on his &quot;Star Wars&quot; script for two and a half years, writing much of it at the back of his San Anselmo house in a room he shared with a gaudy Wurlitzer jukebox. In 1977, Lucas screened an early version of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, without completed special effects, at his San Anselmo home for a small group of Hollywood friends, including the producer Alan Ladd Jr., directors Steven Spielberg, Brian DePalma, and Martin Scorsese, and screenwriters Jay Cocks, Willard Huyck, and Gloria Katz.

==Geography==
The average high temperature is , in July, and the average low temperature is , in January and December. The record high was in July 1972, and record low was in December 1990. Average rainfall is , with the rainiest month being January.

All but a sliver of San Anselmo lies within the Ross Valley Watershed that flows into San Francisco Bay. The principal waterway of the town&#x27;s portion of the watershed is San Anselmo Creek, a branch of Corte Madera Creek. Two of San Anselmo Creek&#x27;s tributaries, Sleepy Hollow Creek and Sorich Creek, also flow through the town, as do East Fork Creek and West Fork Creek, Sorich Creek&#x27;s two tributaries.

There are three main roads running through San Anselmo. Their junction is known locally as the Hub, which lies near the central business district. Sir Francis Drake Boulevard runs north from Ross, turns northwest at the Hub, and then proceeds west to Fairfax. Red Hill Avenue (also called &quot;The Miracle Mile&quot;) runs west from San Rafael, after 4th Street and 3rd Street merge, and into the Hub where it becomes Center Boulevard. Center Boulevard runs northwest from the Hub to Fairfax and Sir Francis Drake parallels Center Boulevard to Fairfax, offset to the north.

The town&#x27;s natural skyline is dominated by the hills of Ross Valley. To the north are Red Hill and Grove Hill. To the southwest is Bald Hill. To the east is Moore Hill. In the distance to the south is Mount Tamalpais.

A large part of southern and western San Anselmo is built on a natural floodplain. About every 15–23 years, heavy rains cause San Anselmo Creek to flood the center of town by up to 4 feet—1925, 1940 ( rainfall in 3 days), 1963, January 1982, as well as December 30/31, 2005. The worst flood, on January 2, 1982 (the highest creek water level, according to interviews with longtime creek-side residents) was preceded by a rainfall amount that exceeded in 12 hours.

San Anselmo&#x27;s historic raised railroad bed (now Center Boulevard), acts as a dike, providing some flood protection to the west-side houses, upstream of the business district.

A number of homes on the floodplain (called the &quot;Flatlands&quot; by the Town) as far back as at least 1920, have been built with raised foundations to accommodate the minor periodic floods.

Most of the downtown antique and boutique stores and restaurants, for which San Anselmo is well known, are along the banks of San Anselmo Creek.

<text>John Florian Sowa (born 1940) is an American computer scientist, an expert in artificial intelligence and computer design, and the inventor of conceptual graphs.

== Biography ==
Sowa received a BS in mathematics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1962, an MA in applied mathematics from Harvard University in 1966, and a PhD in computer science from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in 1999 with a dissertation titled &quot;Knowledge Representation: Logical, Philosophical, and Computational Foundations&quot;.

Sowa spent most of his professional career at IBM, starting in 1962 at IBM&#x27;s applied mathematics group. Over the decades he has researched and developed emerging fields of computer science from compilers, programming languages, and system architecture to artificial intelligence and knowledge representation. In the 1990s Sowa was associated with the IBM Educational Center in New York. Over the years he taught courses at the IBM Systems Research Institute, Binghamton University, Stanford University, the Linguistic Society of America and the Université du Québec à Montréal. He is a fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

After early retirement at IBM, Sowa in 2001 cofounded VivoMind Intelligence, Inc. with Arun K. Majumdar. With this company he was developing data-mining and database technology, more specifically high-level &quot;ontologies&quot; for artificial intelligence and automated natural language understanding. Currently Sowa is working with Kyndi Inc., also founded by Majumdar.

John Sowa is married to the philologist Cora Angier Sowa, and they live in Croton-on-Hudson, New York.

== Work ==
Sowa&#x27;s research interests since the 1970s were in the field of artificial intelligence, expert systems and database query linked to natural languages. In his work he combines ideas from numerous disciplines and eras modern and ancient, for example, applying ideas from Aristotle, the medieval scholastics to Alfred North Whitehead and including database schema theory, and incorporating the model of analogy of Islamic scholar Ibn Taymiyyah in his works.

=== Conceptual graph ===

Sowa invented conceptual graphs, a graphic notation for logic and natural language, based on the structures in semantic networks and on the existential graphs of Charles S. Peirce. He introduced the concept in the 1976 article &quot;Conceptual graphs for a data base interface&quot; in the &quot;IBM Journal of Research and Development&quot;. He elaborated upon it in the 1983 book &quot;Conceptual structures: information processing in mind and machine&quot;.

In the 1980s, this theory had &quot;been adopted by a number of research and development groups throughout the world. International conferences on conceptual structures (ICCS) have been held since 1993, following a series of conceptual graph workshops that began in 1986.

===Sowa&#x27;s law of standards===
In 1991, Sowa first stated his &quot;Law of Standards&quot;: 
: &quot;Whenever a major organization develops a new system as an official standard for X, the primary result is the widespread adoption of some simpler system as a de facto standard for X.&quot; 
Like Gall&#x27;s law, The Law of Standards is essentially an argument in favour of underspecification. Examples include:

*The introduction of PL/I resulting in COBOL and FORTRAN becoming the de facto standards for business and scientific programming respectively
*The introduction of Algol-68 resulting in Pascal becoming the de facto standard for academic programming
*The introduction of the Ada language resulting in C becoming the de facto standard for US Department of Defense programming
*The introduction of OS/2 resulting in Windows becoming the de facto standard for desktop OS
*The introduction of X.400 resulting in SMTP becoming the de facto standard for electronic mail
*The introduction of X.500 resulting in LDAP becoming the de facto standard for directory services

<text>The Intel 4004 is a 4-bit central processing unit (CPU) released by Intel Corporation in 1971. Sold for US$60 (), it was the first commercially produced microprocessor, and the first in a long line of Intel CPUs. Intel managed to fit the entire central processing unit onto a single circuit, which was called a microprocessor.

The 4004 was the first significant example of large-scale integration, showcasing the superiority of the MOS silicon gate technology (SGT). Compared to the incumbent technology, the SGT integrated on the same chip area embodied twice the number of transistors with five times the operating speed. This step-function increase in performance made possible a single-chip CPU, replacing the existing multi-chip CPUs. The innovative 4004 chip design served as a model on how to use the SGT for complex logic and memory circuits, thus accelerating the adoption of the SGT by the world&#x27;s semiconductor industry. The developer of the original SGT at Fairchild was Federico Faggin, who designed the first commercial integrated circuit (IC) that used the new technology, proving its superiority for analog/digital applications (Fairchild 3708 in 1968). He later used the SGT at Intel to obtain the unprecedented integration necessary to make the 4004.

The project traces its history to 1969, when Busicom Corp. approached Intel to design a family of seven chips for an electronic calculator, three of which constituted a CPU specialized for making different calculating machines. The CPU was based on data stored on shift-registers and instructions stored on ROM (read-only memory). The complexity of the three-chip CPU logic design led Marcian Hoff to propose a more conventional CPU architecture based on data stored on RAM (random-access memory). This architecture was much simpler and more general-purpose and could potentially be integrated into a single chip, thus reducing the cost and improving the speed. Design began in April 1970 under the direction of Faggin, aided by Masatoshi Shima, who contributed to the architecture and later to the logic design. The first delivery of a fully operational 4004 was in March 1971 to Busicom for its 141-PF printing calculator engineering prototype (now displayed in the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California). General sales began July 1971.

A number of innovations developed by Faggin while working at Fairchild Semiconductor allowed the 4004 to be produced on a single chip. The main concept was the use of the self-aligned gate, made of polysilicon rather than metal, which allowed the components to be much closer together and work at higher speed. To make the 4004 possible, Faggin also developed the &quot;bootstrap load&quot;, considered unfeasible with silicon gate, and the &quot;buried contact&quot; that allowed the silicon gates to be connected directly to the source and drain of the transistors without the use of metal. Together, these innovations doubled the circuit density, and thus halved cost, allowing a single chip to contain 2,300 transistors and run five times faster than designs using the previous MOS technology with aluminum gates.

The 4004 design was later improved by Faggin as the Intel 4040 in 1974. The naming convention continued with the Intel 8008 and 8080, which are 8-bit designs.

==History==
===Original concept===
In April 1969, Busicom approached Intel to produce a new design for an electronic calculator. They based their design on the architecture of the 1965 Olivetti Programma 101, one of the world&#x27;s first tabletop programmable calculators. The key difference was that the Busicom design would use integrated circuits to replace the printed circuit boards filled with individual components, and solid-state shift registers for memory instead of the costly magnetostriction wire in the 101.

In contrast to earlier calculator designs, Busicom had developed a general-purpose processor concept with the goal of introducing it in a low-end desktop printing calculator, and then using the same design for other roles like cash registers and automatic teller machines. The company had already produced a calculator using TTL small-scale integration logic ICs and were interested in having Intel reduce the chip count using Intel&#x27;s medium-scale integration (MSI) techniques.

Intel assigned the recently hired Marcian Hoff, employee number 12, to act as the liaison between the two companies. In late June, three engineers from Busicom, Masatoshi Shima and his colleagues Masuda and Takayama, traveled to Intel to introduce the design. Although he had only been assigned to liaise with the engineers, Hoff began studying the concept. Their initial proposal had seven ICs: program control, arithmetic unit (ALU), timing, program ROM, shift registers for temporary memory, printer controller and input/output control.

Hoff became concerned that the number of chips and the required interconnections between them would make Busicom&#x27;s price goals impossible to meet. Combining the chips would reduce the complexity and cost. He was also concerned that the still-small Intel would not have enough design staff to make seven separate chips at the same time. He raised these concerns with upper management, and Bob Noyce, the CEO, told Hoff he would support a different approach if it seemed feasible.

===Simplified design===
A key concept in the Busicom design was that the program control and ALU were not aimed specifically at the calculator market, it was the program in ROM that turned it into a calculator. The original idea was that the company could use the same chips with different amounts of shift-register RAM and program ROM to produce a range of calculating machines. Hoff was struck by how closely the Busicom&#x27;s instruction set architecture matched that of general-purpose computers. He began to consider whether a truly general-purpose processor could be made cheaply enough to be used in a calculator. When later asked where he got the ideas for the architecture of the first microprocessor, Hoff related that Plessey, &quot;a British tractor company&quot;, had donated a minicomputer to Stanford, and he had &quot;played with it some&quot; while he was there. Tadashi Sasaki attributes the idea to break the calculator into four parts to an unnamed woman from the Nara Women&#x27;s College present at a brainstorming meeting that was held in Japan prior to his first meeting with Intel.

Another development that allowed this design to be made practical was Intel&#x27;s work on the earliest dynamic RAM (DRAM) chips. Shift registers at that time were among the only low-cost read and write memory devices. Shift register memory is not suited for random access, instead, with every clock pulse they move the stored data one cell along a chain of cells. Data retrieval time is thus a function of the clock speed, the number of cells in a chain, and the data&#x27;s location in the chain. If the processor had to wait for each bit to cycle through the register, the resulting effective speed would be far too low to be practical. DRAM, on the other hand, allows random access, while the three transistor DRAM cell saves silicon area compared to the six transistor shift register cell.

Finally, Hoff noticed that much of the complexity of the program control chip was due to every instruction being implemented separately. He suggested that the chip instead support subroutine calls and instructions be implemented as subroutines where possible. The application naturally suggested a 4-bit design, as this allowed direct manipulation of binary-coded decimal (BCD) values used by calculators. Hoff worked on the overall design concept through July and August 1969 but found that the Busicom executives seemed uninterested in his proposal.

===Mazor joins===
Unknown to Hoff, the Busicom team were extremely interested in his proposal. However, there were a number of specific issues that they were concerned about. One key issue was that certain routines like decimal adjust and keyboard handling would use large amounts of ROM space if implemented as subroutines. Another was that the design did not feature any sort of interrupt, so dealing with real-time events would be difficult. Finally, storing the numbers as 4-bit BCD would require additional memory to store the sign and decimal place.

In September 1969, Stanley Mazor joined Intel from Fairchild. Hoff and Mazor quickly came up with solutions to the Busicom concerns. To address the complexity of the subroutines, originally solved in Busicom&#x27;s design using one-byte macroinstructions and complex decoder circuitry, Mazor developed a 20-byte long interpreter that executed the same macroinstructions. Shima suggested adding a new interrupt that would be triggered by a pin, thereby allowing the keyboard to be interrupt-driven. He also modified the Branch Back (return from subroutine) instruction to clear the accumulator.

To reach the price goals, it was important that the chip be as small as possible and use the fewest number of leads. As data was 4 bits and the address space was 12 bits (4096 bytes), there was no way direct access could be arranged with anything fewer than about 24 pins. This was not small enough, so the design would use a 16-pin dual in-line package (DIP) layout and use multiplexing of a single set of 4 lines. This meant specifying which address in ROM to access required three clock cycles, and another two to read it from memory. Running at 1 MHz would allow it to perform math on the BCD values at about 80 microseconds per digit.

The result of the discussions between Intel and Busicom was an architecture that reduced the 7-chip Busicom design to a 4-chip Intel proposal composed of CPU, ROM, RAM and I/O (input-output) devices. The proposal was presented to a visiting team of Busicom executives in October 1969. They agreed that the new concept was superior and gave Intel the go-ahead to begin development. Hoff was upset to learn that the contract assigned all rights to the design to Busicom, in spite of it being designed entirely within Intel. The team then left for Japan, but Shima remained in California until December, developing many of the subroutines.

===Faggin joins===
Neither Hoff nor Mazor, who worked in the Applications Research group, had experience designing the actual silicon, and the design group was already overworked with the development of memory devices. In April 1970, Leslie Vadász, who ran the MOS design group, hired Federico Faggin from Fairchild Semiconductor to take over the project. Faggin had already made a name for himself by leading the entire development of the MOS silicon gate technology and the design of the first commercial integrated circuit (IC) made with it. The new technology was going to change the entire semiconductor market.

Integrated circuits consist of a number of individual components like transistors and resistors that are produced by mixing the underlying silicon with &quot;dopants&quot;. This is normally accomplished by heating the chip in the presence of a chemical gas, which diffuses into the surface. Previously, the individual components were connected together to make a circuit using aluminum wires deposited on the surface. As aluminum melts at 600 degrees and silicon at 1000, the traces typically had to be deposited as the last step, which often complicated the production cycle.

In 1967, Bell Labs released a paper about making MOS transistors with self-aligned gates made of silicon rather than metal. These devices, however, were a proof-of-concept and could not be used to make ICs. Faggin and Tom Klein had taken what was a curiosity and developed the entire process technology needed to fabricate reliable ICs. Faggin also designed and produced the Fairchild 3708, the first IC made with SGT, first sold at the end of 1968, and featured on the cover of &quot;Electronics&quot; in September 1969. The silicon gate technology also reduced the leakage current by more than 100 times, making possible sophisticated dynamic circuits like DRAMs (dynamic random access memories). It also allowed the highly-doped silicon used for the gates to form the interconnections, greatly improving the circuit density of random-logic ICs like microprocessors.

This technique meant the interconnections could be performed at any time in the process. More importantly, the wiring was deposited using the same equipment that made the rest of the components. This meant that the slight differences in layout between different machine types was eliminated. Previously the interconnects had to be much larger than required in order to ensure the aluminum touched the silicon components which would be offset due to inaccuracies in the machinery. With this issue eliminated, the circuits could be placed much closer together, immediately doubling the density of the components, and thus reducing their cost by the same amount. Additionally, the aluminum wiring acted as capacitors which limited the signal speed; removing these allowed the chips to run at faster speeds.

At Intel, Faggin began design of the new processor using this self-aligned gate process. Only days after Faggin joined the company Intel, Shima arrived from Japan. He was disappointed to learn that no work on the project had taken place since he left in December, and expressed his concern original schedule was now impossible. Faggin responded by working well into the night every day, and Shima stayed on for another six months to help. Faggin himself immersed himself in workweeks that spanned 70 to 80 hours. Additional advances were needed to reach the required circuit density. One of these advances was the use of &quot;buried contacts&quot; that allowed the silicon connecting wires to be directly connected to the components. Another was figuring out how to make adding &quot;bootstrap loads&quot; with silicon gate as part of one of the masking steps, eliminating one step from the processing. Without these two innovations by Faggin, Hoff&#x27;s architecture could not have been realized in a single chip.

===Into production===
Intel&#x27;s chip-naming scheme at that time used a four-digit number for each component. The first digit indicated the process technology used, the second digit indicated the generic function, and the last two digits specified the sequential number in the development of that component type. Using this convention, the chips would have been known as the 1302, 1105, 1507, and 1202. Faggin felt this would obscure the fact that they formed a coherent set, and decided to name them as the &quot;4000 family&quot;. The four chips were the following:
* the &quot;Intel 4001&quot;, a 256-byte 4-bit ROM;
* the &quot;Intel 4002&quot;, DRAM with four 20-nibble registers (total size 40 bytes);
* the &quot;Intel 4003&quot;, an I/O chip comprising a 10-bit static shift register with serial and parallel outputs; and
* the &quot;Intel 4004&quot; CPU. 
A fully expanded system could support 16 Intel 4001s for a total of 4 kB of ROM, 16 Intel 4002s for a total of 1,280 nibbles (640 bytes) of RAM, and an unlimited number of 4003s. The 4003s were connected to programmable input and output pins on the 4001 and to output pins on the 4002, not directly to the CPU.

With the design complete, Shima returned to Japan to begin building a prototype of the calculator. The first wafers of the 4001 were processed in October 1970, followed by the 4003 and 4002 in November. The 4002 proved to have a minor problem that was easily corrected. The first 4004s arrived at the end of December, and were completely non-functional. Probing the chip, Faggin found that the buried-contact fabrication step had been left out. A second run was fabricated in January 1971 and the 4004 worked as expected except for two minor problems.

Faggin was sending samples of these chips to Shima as they arrived. In April 1971 they learned the calculator prototype was operational. Later that month Shima sent Intel the final masks for the 4001 ROMs, the design was now complete. It consisted of one 4004, two 4002, three 4003, and four 4001 chips. An additional 4001 supplied the optional square root function. One final change was added after Faggin found a problem in the 4001 and 4002 that occurred only when the chips were hot. Adding a new register decoder circuit in both solved the issue. Quantity production began in August 1971.

===Marketing the 4004===
During a call to Shima, Faggin learned that Busicom was in financial difficulty and would likely fail if the chip price was not reduced. Faggin then convinced Noyce to lower the price in exchange for releasing Intel from the exclusivity agreement. In May 1971 Busicom agreed to this, on the condition that it not be used for any other calculator project and that Intel would repay their $60,000 development costs. With this change of marketing focus name of the chip family name was changed to MCS-4, short for Micro Computer System, 4-bit.

Intel management was skeptical that their sales team could explain the product to their customers. As Intel was now successful in the memory market, they were concerned the 4004 might confuse the market and were hesitant to advertise it. They feared current Intel customers might view the new product as competition, purchasing memory from competitors instead. Hoff and Mazor were also concerned that the design&#x27;s limitations would make it less interesting to users who were accustomed to the new 16-bit minicomputers entering the market at that time.

This all changed in the summer of 1971, when Ed Gelbach, formerly of Texas Instruments, took over the marketing department and immediately began plans to publicly announce the product. This took place in the November 1971 when Intel ran ads &quot;Announcing a new era of integrated electronics,&quot; first appearing in the November 15 edition of &quot;Electronic News&quot;.

===The 8008===
The 4004 became the first commercial microprocessor available for general use. This was almost not the case.

In December 1969, Intel was approached by Computer Terminal Corporation (CTC) to produce a custom bipolar memory chip for a computer terminal they were designing, the Datapoint 2200. Mazor and Hoff considered their CPU design and concluded it was not much more complicated than the 4004, and that it could be implemented as a single-chip 8-bit CPU. A few weeks before they hired Faggin, in March 1970 Intel hired Hal Feeney to design the Intel 8008, at that time called the 1201, following Intel&#x27;s naming convention. However, CTC decided to initially proceed with a conventional TTL implementation of their CPU and the project was lowered in priority. Feeney was assigned to other projects and ultimately ended up helping Faggin with testing the 4000 family chips.

In January 1971, Feeney was reassigned back to the 1201 under Faggin&#x27;s supervision and production chips were available in March 1972. In May, Hoff and Mazor went on a speaking tour to introduce the two CPU designs around the USA. The tradeoffs between the two designs were that with the 4004 and its memory and I/O chips it was much easier to build a complete computer system while the 8008 was more flexible, had a larger 16 kB address space, and offered more instructions. A significant difference is that while a minimal 4004 system could be built using only two chips, one 4004 and one 4001 (256-byte ROM), the 8008 would require at least 20 additional TTL components for interfacing with memory and I/O functions.

The two designs found themselves being used in different roles. The 4004 was used where the cost of implementation was the major concern, and became widely used in embedded controllers for applications like microwave ovens or traffic lights and similar roles. The 8008 instead found itself mostly used in user-programmable applications, such as computer terminals, microcomputers and similar roles. This split in functionality remains to this day, with the former being known as a microcontroller.

==Description==
The 4004 employs a 10 μm process silicon-gate enhancement-load pMOS technology on a and can execute approximately instructions per second; a single instruction cycle is The original clock rate design goal was 1 MHz, the same as the IBM 1620 Model I.

The Intel 4004 was fabricated using masks produced by physically cutting each pattern at 500x magnification on a large sheet of Rubylith photo-reducing it, and repeating, a process made obsolete by current computer graphic design capabilities.

For the purpose of testing the produced chips, Faggin developed a tester for silicon wafers of MCS-4 family that was itself driven by 4004 chip. The tester also served as a proof for the management that Intel 4004 microprocessor could be used not only in calculator-like products, but also for control applications.

The 4004 includes functions for direct low-level control of memory-chip selection and I/O, which are not normally handled by the microprocessor; however, its functionality is limited in that it cannot execute code from RAM and is limited to whatever instructions are provided in ROM (or an independently loaded RAM working as ROM—in either case, the processor is itself unable to write or transfer data into an executable memory space). The RAM and ROM parts chips also unusual in their integration of I/O functions together with their primary memory function. This partitioning significantly reduced the minimum part count in an MCS-4 system, but required inclusion of a certain amount of processor-like logic on the memory chips themselves to accept, decode and execute relatively high-level data-transfer instructions.

The standard arrangement for a 4004 system is anything up to 16 × 4001 ROM chips (in a single bank) and 16 × 4002 RAM chips (in four banks of four), which together provide the 4 KB program storage, 1024 + 256 nibbles of data/status storage, plus 64 output and 64 input/output external data/control lines (which can themselves be used to operate, e.g. a 4003). Intel&#x27;s MCS-4 documentation, however, claims that up to 48 ROM and RAM chips (providing up to 192 external control lines) &quot;in any combination&quot; can be connected to the 4004 &quot;with simple gating hardware&quot;, but declines to give any further detail or examples of how this would actually be achieved.

== Technical specifications ==



* Maximum clock rate is 740 kHz. The 4004 had this maximum clock rating upon its initial 1971 release.
* Instruction cycle time: minimum 10.8 μs (8 clock cycles per machine cycle).
* Instruction execution time 1 or 2 machine cycles (10.8 or 21.6 μs), to instructions per second.
** Adding two 8-digit decimal numbers (32 bits each, assuming 4-bit BCD digits) takes a claimed 850 μs, or approximately 79 machine cycles (632 clock ticks), for an average of just under 10 cycles (80 ticks) per digit pair and an operating speed of 1176 × 8-digit additions per second
* Separate program and data storage. Contrary to Harvard architecture designs, however, which use separate buses, the 4004, with its need to keep pin count down, uses a single multiplexed 4-bit bus for transferring:
** 12-bit addresses,
** 8-bit instructions,
** 4-bit data words.
* Able to directly address 5120 bits (equivalent to 640 bytes) of RAM, stored as 1280 4-bit &quot;characters&quot; and organized into groups representing 1024 &quot;data&quot; and 256 &quot;status&quot; characters (512 and 128 bytes).
* Able to directly address bits of ROM, equivalent to and arranged as 4096 8-bit words (i.e. bytes).
* Instruction set contained 46 instructions (of which 41 were 8 bits wide and 5 were 16 bits wide).
* Register set contains 16 registers of 4 bits each.
* Internal subroutine stack, 3 levels deep.

=== Logic levels ===
=== Support chips ===
* 4001: 256-byte ROM (256 8-bit &quot;program&quot; instructions) and one built-in 4-bit I/O port. A 4001 ROM+I/O chip cannot be used in a system along with a 4008/4009 pair.
* 4002: 40-byte RAM (80 4-bit &quot;data&quot; words) and one built-in 4-bit output port; the RAM portion of the chip is organized into 4 &quot;registers&quot; of 20 4-bit words:
** 16 data words (used for mantissa digits in the original calculator design), accessed in a relatively standard manner,
** 4 status words (used for exponent digits and signs in the original calculator design), accessed using I/O type commands in place of the ROM&#x27;s input channel.
* 4003: 10-bit parallel output shift register for scanning keyboards, displays, printers, etc.
* 4008: 8-bit address latch for access to standard memory chips and one built-in 4-bit chip-select and I/O port.
* 4009: program and I/O access converter to standard memory and I/O chips.
* 4269: keyboard/display interface.
* 4289: memory interface (combined functions of 4008 and 4009).

The minimum system specification described by Intel consists of a 4004 with a single 256-byte 4001 program ROM; there is no explicit need for separate RAM in minimal-complexity applications thanks to the 4004&#x27;s large number of onboard index registers, which represent the equivalent of 16 × 4-bit or 8 × 8-bit characters (or a mixture) of working RAM, nor for simple interface chips thanks to the ROM&#x27;s built-in I/O lines. However, as project complexity increases, the various other support chips start to become useful.

===Packaging===
Numerous versions of the Intel MCS-4 line of processors were produced. The earliest versions, marked C (like C4004), were ceramic and used a zebra pattern of white and gray on the back of the chips, often called &quot;grey traces&quot;. The next generation of the chips was plain white ceramic (also marked C), and then dark gray ceramic (D). Many of the more recent versions of MCS-4 family were also produced with plastic (P).

==Use==
The first commercial product to use a microprocessor was the Busicom calculator 141-PF. Shima also remembers a teller machine and a billing machine that used the 4004. The 4004 was also used in the first microprocessor-controlled pinball game, a prototype produced by Dave Nutting Associates for Bally in 1974.

A popular myth has it that Pioneer 10, the first spacecraft to leave the solar system, used an Intel 4004 microprocessor. According to Dr. Larry Lasher of Ames Research Center, the Pioneer team did evaluate the 4004, but decided it was too new at the time to include in any of the Pioneer projects. The myth was repeated by Federico Faggin himself in a lecture for the Computer History Museum in 2006.

==Distinction as first commercially-available microprocessor chip==
Multi-chip CPU designs were produced before the 4004. The Four-Phase Systems AL1 chip in 1969 combined registers and an ALU, but required an external control unit. The MP944 multi-chip processor based on a chipset of six unique chips (which separated steering logic, computation, and intermediate data storage into separate chips) was completed in 1970 for the F-14 fighter jet as part of its Central Air Data Computer (F-14 CADC) and was classified until 1998. The 4004 instead combined instruction decoding, computation, result routing, and register storage all on the same single chip.

On September 17, 1971 (two months before the 4004), the Texas Instruments TMS0100 (originally designated TMS1802NC) was announced as a &quot;calculator on a chip&quot; that integrated a CPU with ram and a program read-only memory. But while it was marketed as &quot;totally programmable&quot;, this programming had to be done by changing a photomask in the manufacturing process. It along with its 1974 successor the TMS1000 (which used a factory-programmed mask ROM) have been considered the first microcontrollers — a computer on a chip containing not only the CPU, but also ROM, RAM, and I/O functions and which typically contains a permanent on-chip program that directs the chip to perform a dedicated function. While its designer was recognized by the US Patent Office in 1996 as the inventor of the microcontroller, microcontrollers generally run a fixed internal program and aren&#x27;t easily reprogrammable and so are distinguished from microprocessors. But because the 4004 executed instructions from &quot;external&quot; memory, it can serve in a general-purpose computer that is easily programmed and so is distinguished as a microprocessor.

According to Nick Tredennick, a microprocessor designer and expert witness to that 1996 patent case:

== Legacy and value ==

Federico Faggin signed the 4004 with his initials because he knew that his silicon gate design embodied &quot;the essence of the microprocessor&quot;. A corner of the die reads &quot;F.F.&quot;

In November 1996 – the 25th anniversary of the microprocessor – Intel gave out to its U.S. employees a brass clock containing a 4004 Microprocessor Chip.

On November 15, 2006, the 35th anniversary of the 4004, Intel celebrated by releasing the chip&#x27;s schematics, mask works, and user manual. A fully functional 41 × 58 cm, 130× scale replica of the Intel 4004 was built using discrete transistors and put on display in 2006 at the Intel Museum in Santa Clara, California.

On October 15, 2010, Faggin, Hoff, and Mazor were awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation by President Barack Obama for their pioneering work on the 4004.

This paper describes a novel static MOS shift register, developed at SGS-Fairchild (now ST Micro) at the end of 1967, before Federico Faggin joined Fairchild&#x27;s R&amp;D in Palo Alto (Ca) in February 1968. Faggin later used this new shift register in the MCS-4 chips, including the 4004(1970).

<text>The Intel 4040 (&quot;forty-forty&quot;) is the second 4-bit microprocessor designed and manufactured by Intel. Introduced in 1974 as a successor to the Intel 4004, the 4040 was produced with a 10 μm process and includes silicon gate enhancement-load PMOS logic technology. The 4040 contained 3,000 transistors and could execute approximately 62,000 instructions per second.

General performance, bus layout and arithmetic logic unit (ALU) were identical to the 4004. The main improvement was to use a larger 24-pin dual inline package, giving it 8 more pins than the 16-pin 4004. Two of these were used to implement interrupts, which were lacking in the 4004 and considered a major oversight. Two more implemented a halt/stop system, which put the processor into a low-power mode and also allowed for single-step operation that made debugging much easier. Another pin was used to bank select a second read only memory (ROM), doubling the amount of ROM the processor could address compared to the 4004.

To make use of these new pins, the instruction set was expanded, increasing it to 60 instructions from the original 46. Additionally, the internal register file and pushdown stack were expanded to support rapid interrupt processing.


==Description==
===4004===

The 4004 was designed to be used in an electronic calculator and many of its design notes are related to this role. For instance, program code can only be read from an area dedicated to read only memory, not RAM. Although one could implement the &quot;ROM space&quot; using RAM chips, there were no instructions able to write to that area of memory, and no instructions able to read program code from RAM space. The idea was that systems would supply the system program on ROM, and small amounts of RAM would be used only for data, if at all. In typical use, the internal &quot;index registers&quot; would be used for storage during calculations, with the 16 4-bit registers able to hold a single 8-digit binary coded decimal value, the data format used by calculators. It also had four 12-bit registers for holding addresses, the top-most was the program counter and the next three operated as a push-down stack for subroutine calls.

To reduce pin count to only 16, the original 4004 had only four data pins, multiplexed for both data and addresses. Additional pins indicated whether the address was in ROM or one of several &quot;banks&quot; of RAM. As addresses were 12 bits long, expressing an address took three cycles along with the subsequent read or write, and external circuitry had to latch each 4 bit part of the address between cycles. Instructions were 8 bits, so loading the next instruction required many cycles, which led to the slow performance in spite of what was a relatively fast cycle time for the era.

===4040===
The 4040 was essentially an expansion of the 4004, with additional pins, more registers and new instructions to take advantage of both.

The 4004 had a single ROM pin, whereas the 4040 added another ROM pin to allow two banks of ROM. This effectively increased the ROM address from 12 to 13 bits, or 8 kB. Unlike later designs where the two lines could be binary encoded and thus support four banks, the ROM chips used with the 4004 and 4040 used these lines like chip select pins, and thus the two lines could only support two banks.

The 4004 lacked interrupts, a serious limitation. The 4040 added a new input pin for calling an interrupt, as well an output pin to indicate the interrupt signal had been noticed and was being acted on. As interrupts also need to save a return address, the stack register file was expanded to seven entries, up from three.

Interrupt handler code normally starts by saving out values in the registers to allow the interrupt code to use them, and then at the end it copies the values back from memory so that the processor returns to its original pre-interrupt state. With the multi-cycle memory access of the design, this would have been extremely slow. To address this, eight additional registers were added in a new &quot;bank 1&quot;, the original sixteen registers retroactively becoming &quot;bank 0&quot;. The idea was that programmers would attempt to place their critical data in the first eight registers of bank 0. When an interrupt was received, the handler code would call an instruction to swap banks, which would cause bank 1&#x27;s registers to override bank 0&#x27;s registers 0 through 7. The handler code would then use these eight registers for any local data, leaving the original values untouched. When the handler completed, it simply swapped bank 0 back in. This reduced the switching time to a single instruction, greatly improving interrupt response times.

Another addition was the input stop pin, and the associated output stop acknowledge. These could be used to stop the processor while the system performed input/output or other non-CPU tasks, but was more widely used for debugging by allowing the processor to be single-stepped. When the processor was in stopped mode, most of the chip hardware put into a low-drain, high-impedance condition, reducing power use. The machine cycle clocks were kept running for the benefit of external devices, including any interrupt controllers needed to wake the chip back up, which relied on these controllers staying in sync.

To take advantage of these new features, and to support the new logical codice_1OR&lt;/code&gt; operators, the instruction set added 14 new instructions, bringing the total to 60.

==Characteristics==
* Data bus: 4-bit
* Address bus: 12-bit for ROM (multiplexed onto data bus; addresses took three bus cycles to transmit, same as in the 4004), effectively 13-bit with use of bank-switching commands; effectively 10-bit or 8-bit for RAM (8-bit direct address plus one-of-four, i.e. 2-bit equivalent, bank select; the additional 256 &quot;status&quot; memory locations required use of I/O commands to read or write, from an overall 8-bit address space) 
* Voltage: −15 V DC
* Operating frequency: 500 to 740 kHz main clock (2-phase, overlapping); 62500 to 92500 8-clock machine cycles per second, each instruction requiring either one or two machine cycles to read and execute, meaning a rough average of 62 kIPS at 740 kHz with an equal mix.
* Performance: Claimed execution time of ~850 μs to add two 32-bit (8-digit BCD) numbers, or around 1175 such operations per second and about 10 machine cycles per digit pair.

== Use in computers ==
The 4040 was first used in a microcomputer in Intel&#x27;s Intellec 4 Mod 40 development system, released in early 1975. According to &quot;Byte&quot; magazine, the first third-party microcomputer designed around the Intel 4040 was the Micro 440, released by Comp-Sultants of Huntsville, Alabama, in late 1975.

<text>Dayanara Torres Delgado (born October 28, 1974) is a Puerto Rican actress, dancer, singer, model, and beauty queen who won the Miss Universe 1993 pageant.

Torres was discovered at age 17 while walking through the Plaza de Toa Alta in her hometown, and was invited to represent Toa Alta in the annual Miss Puerto Rico pageant. She won the pageant and the right to represent Puerto Rico in the 1993 Miss Universe pageant. In 1992, she participated in the Miss International pageant and became a semi-finalist. The same year, she earned second place at the Queen of the World contest.

Torres won the crown in the Miss Universe pageant held in Mexico in May 1993. Torres&#x27;s victory in the pageant caused some controversy because of the claim that she was still a minor; however, Torres had turned 18 several months before the contest. Her victory also raised some eyebrows, as she did not top any of the pageant&#x27;s segments. When Torres returned home to Puerto Rico, she was received with a parade.

During and after her reign as Miss Universe, she became an ambassador for UNICEF, traveling through Asia and Latin America in support of the organization. She created the Dayanara Torres Foundation which has provided scholarships to poor students in Puerto Rico and the Philippines. In 1994, she went to Manila to crown the new Miss Universe and during the ceremony, she sang &quot;A Whole New World&quot; as a duet with Peabo Bryson.

==Career==
===Torres in the Philippines===
After the 1994 Miss Universe pageant, Torres landed several movie roles, made television appearances, and received offers to endorse products. She became a celebrity in the Philippines and lived in the country for five years. During her time in the Philippines, Torres learned to speak Tagalog, the national language of the country. Torres endorsed Pantene shampoo in 1998-1999.

She appeared in more than 10 movies, including &quot;Hataw Na&quot;, a film with Filipino actor and singer Gary Valenciano (who is half-Puerto Rican). During that time, she also filmed &quot;Linda Sara&quot; (1994), a Puerto Rican film directed by Jacobo Morales in which she was paired with fellow Puerto Rican singer, Chayanne. She also became a staple figure on Philippine television every Sunday on the show &quot;ASAP Mania&quot;, where her dancing skills gained her the informal title &quot;Dancing Queen.&quot;

===Return to Puerto Rico===
Torres returned to Puerto Rico in 1998 and as a singer released her only album called &quot;Antifaz&quot;. It reached the top of &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in Latin America and the Philippines. She also starred in several theater productions on the island. That same year, a &quot;Dayanara&quot; doll was released and sold out in both Puerto Rico and the Philippines.

On September 1, 2005, Torres debuted in an American soap opera, playing a small role in &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. The program&#x27;s producers expressed an interest in future appearances. To date, Torres has not made any other appearances on the show. Torres later starred in &quot;Watch Over Me&quot;, a MyNetworkTV primetime drama.

In 2008, Torres was included in &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Most Beautiful People&quot; list. During the celebration ceremony, Torres stated she authored the self-help book &quot;Married to Me&quot; when she failed to find a book to help her with her 2003 separation from Marc Anthony in bookstores.

===Return to the Philippines===
In 2017, Torres made a return to the country as a judge for Miss Universe 2016, along with various guest appearances on Philippine television.

In February 2017, Torres was asked whether or not she would be willing to do a romantic TV series with her former boyfriend and leading man Aga Muhlach; she said she was more than willing to do so.

==Personal life==
Torres has two older brothers, José and Joey, and a younger sister, Jeannette. Upon completion of her high school studies at Colegio Santa Rosa, in Bayamón, Torres had expressed interest in going to dentistry college to become an orthodontist.

While she was living in the Philippines, Torres was in a five-year relationship with Filipino actor Aga Muhlach (who is now married to Charlene Gonzalez, a Miss Universe 1994 top six finalist); Torres and Muhlach first met on the set of her first Philippine movie, &quot;Basta&#x27;t Kasama Kita&quot; (&quot;As Long As I&#x27;m with You&quot;).

Torres married singer Marc Anthony on May 9, 2000, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The marriage resulted in two sons, Cristian Anthony Muñiz (b. February 5, 2001) and Ryan Anthony Muñiz (b. August 16, 2003). Their marriage was allegedly &quot;rocky&quot;, and the two separated, after just two years of marriage, in the summer of 2002. They later reconciled and renewed their vows in a ceremony, held in Puerto Rico, in December 2002.

The couple&#x27;s final separation was one year later, in October 2003, with Torres filing for divorce in January 2004. The divorce was finalized June 1, 2004.

In June of 2014, a judge ruled in Torres&#x27;s favor by approving a two-fold increase in Marc Anthony&#x27;s monthly child support payments (from $13,400 to $26,800); Torres had initially sought to receive monthly payments totaling $123,426 when it was alleged that Anthony had spent only 35 days with their children in 2012, but the Court discovered that he had spent 71 days with them.

On February 4, 2019, Torres announced she had been diagnosed with skin cancer. In February 2020, she announced she had completed the last session of her radiation treatment, and shared a month later that she was cancer-free.

== Accolades ==
* Press Club of the Philippines 1995 (a.k.a. PMPC Star Awards for TV) – &quot;Best New TV Personality Award&quot; for ASAP on ABS-CBN 2 (Winner)
* Premios Juventud 2006 – &quot;Chica Que Me Quita El Sueño&quot; (Winner)

<doc id="102398" wikidata="Q2389402" url="?curid=102398" title="G.723.1">
<text>G.723.1 is an audio codec for voice that compresses voice audio in frames. An algorithmic look-ahead of duration means that total algorithmic delay is . Its official name is &quot;Dual rate speech coder for multimedia communications transmitting at 5.3 and &quot;. It is sometimes associated with a Truespeech trademark in coprocessors produced by DSP Group.

This is a completely different codec from G.723.

There are two bit rates at which G.723.1 can operate:
* (using 24-byte frames) using a MPC-MLQ algorithm (MOS 3.9)
* (using 20-byte frames) using an ACELP algorithm (MOS 3.62)

== Use ==
G.723.1 is mostly used in Voice over IP (VoIP) applications due to its low bandwidth requirement. Music or tones such as DTMF or fax tones cannot be transported reliably with this codec, and thus some other method such as G.711 or out-of-band methods should be used to transport these signals. The complexity of the algorithm is below 16 MIPS. 2.2 kilobytes of RAM is needed for codebooks.

G.723.1 is a required audio codec in the H.324 ITU-T recommendation for H.324 terminals offering audio communication. In 3GPP 3G-324M specification support for G.723.1 is not mandatory, but recommended.

== Features ==
* Sampling frequency /16-bit (240 samples for frames)
* Fixed bit rate ( with 20 byte frames, with 24 byte frames)
* Fixed frame size for each rate ( with 20 byte frames, with 24 byte frames)
* Algorithmic delay is per frame, with look-ahead delay
* G.723.1 is a hybrid speech coder, with high bit rate using multi-pulse maximum likelihood quantization (MP-MLQ) and low bit rate using algebraic code-excited linear prediction (ACELP)
* The complexity of the algorithm is rated at 25, using a relative scale where G.711 is 1 and G.729a is 15.
* G.723.1 Annex A defines 4 byte silence insertion descriptor (SID) frame for Comfort Noise Generation
* PSQM testing under ideal conditions yields mean opinion scores of 4.08 for G.723.1 (), compared to 4.45 for G.711 (μ-law)
* PSQM testing under network stress yields mean opinion scores of 3.57 for G.723.1 (), compared to 4.13 for G.711 (μ-law)

== Licensing ==
As of January 1, 2017, the patent terms of most patents applying to G.723.1 have expired. With regard to the unexpired licensed patents of their G.723.1 patent license agreement, the licensors of G.723.1 patents, namely AudioCodes, Orange SA, and Université de Sherbrooke have agreed to license their patents under the existing terms on a royalty-free basis starting January 1, 2017.

<text>Speedy Gonzales is an animated cartoon character in the Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of cartoons. He is portrayed as &quot;The Fastest Mouse in all Mexico&quot; with his major traits being the ability to run extremely fast, being quick-witted and heroic, and speaking with an exaggerated Mexican accent. He usually wears a yellow &quot;sombrero&quot;, white shirt and trousers (which was a common traditional outfit worn by men and boys of rural Mexican villages), and a red kerchief, similar to that of some traditional Mexican attires. There have been 46 theatrical shorts made either starring or featuring the character.

==History==

Speedy&#x27;s first appearance was in 1953&#x27;s &quot;Cat-Tails for Two&quot; though he appeared largely in name (and super speed) only. It would be two years before Friz Freleng and layout artist Hawley Pratt redesigned the character into his modern incarnation for the 1955 Freleng short of the same name. The cartoon features Sylvester the Cat guarding a cheese factory at the international border between the United States and Mexico from starving Mexican mice. The mice call in the plucky, excessively energetic Speedy (voiced by Mel Blanc) to save them. Amid cries of &quot;¡Ándale! ¡Ándale! ¡Arriba! ¡Arriba! ¡Epe! ¡Epe! ¡Epe! Yeehaw!&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Go on! Go on! Up! Up!&quot;, although &quot;Ándale arriba&quot; may have been intended as meaning &quot;hurry up&quot;), Sylvester soon gets his comeuppance. The cartoon won the 1955 Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons).
While Speedy&#x27;s last name was given as &quot;Gonzalez&quot; in &quot;Cat-Tails&quot; (on a printed business card shown in the cartoon), it was spelled with an &#x27;s&#x27; from &quot;Speedy Gonzales&quot; onward. Today, the earlier spelling is sometimes used.

Freleng and McKimson soon set Sylvester up as Speedy&#x27;s regular nemesis in a series of cartoons, much in the same way Chuck Jones had paired Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner in his Road Runner cartoons (and indeed, all four characters ended up competing with each other in the short &quot;The Wild Chase&quot;). Sylvester (often called &quot;El Gringo Pussygato&quot; by Speedy) is constantly outsmarted and outrun by the mouse, causing the cat to suffer all manner of pain and humiliation from mousetraps to accidentally consuming large amounts of Tabasco hot sauce. Other cartoons pair the mouse with his cousin, Slowpoke Rodriguez, the &quot;slowest Mouse in all Mexico.&quot; Slowpoke regularly gets into all sorts of trouble that often require Speedy to save him—but one cat in &quot;Mexicali Shmoes&quot; says that as if to compensate for his slowness, &quot;he pack a gun!&quot; In the mid 1960s, Speedy&#x27;s main rival and second nemesis became Daffy Duck, whom Speedy usually referred to as &quot;the duck.&quot;

Speedy has the reputation of being a hit with the female mice. In many cartoons, when the mice decide to get Speedy to help them, one of the mice mentions that &quot;Speedy Gonzales is friend of my sister&quot;. Another mouse adds that, &quot;Speedy Gonzales is friend of &quot;everybody&#x27;s&quot; sister&quot;, which earns a big laugh from the other mice.

===Notable cartoon appearances===

* &quot;See Ya Later Gladiator&quot; (1968) – final theatrical appearance.

==Controversy==
Feeling that the character presented an offensive Mexican stereotype, Cartoon Network shelved Speedy&#x27;s films when it gained exclusive rights to broadcast them in 1999 (as a subsidiary of Time Warner, Cartoon Network is a corporate sibling to Warner Bros.). In an interview with Fox News on March 28, 2002, Cartoon Network spokeswoman Laurie Goldberg commented, &quot;It hasn&#x27;t been on the air for years because of its ethnic stereotypes.&quot;

However, the Hispanic-American rights organization League of United Latin American Citizens called Speedy a cultural icon, and thousands of users registered their support of the character on the hispaniconline.com message boards. Fan campaigns to put Speedy back on the air resulted in the return of the animated shorts to Cartoon Network in 2002.

Speedy Gonzales remained a popular character in Latin America. Many Hispanic people remembered him fondly as a quick-witted, heroic Mexican character who always got the best of his opponents, at a time when such positive depictions of Latin Americans were rare in popular entertainment.

In 2006, Volkswagen licensed Speedy Gonzales for a series of Spanish-language commercials for the Volkswagen Golf, using footage from the cartoon of the same name.

In a March 2021 essay, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; columnist Gustavo Arellano wrote, &quot;I love Speedy so much, I keep a large painting of him in my home office. His kind smile and brown skin takes me back to my childhood — and reminds me of where we as Mexicans exist today.&quot;

==Other appearances==

In 1983, he co-starred with Daffy Duck once again in &quot;Daffy Duck&#x27;s Movie: Fantastic Island&quot;. He also made a cameo appearance in the finale sequence of the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;. He had one appearance in the &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; episode segment &quot;The Acme Acres Summer Olympics&quot;, as the coach, and serving as the mentor of Lightning Rodriguez. He had a minor role in the 1996 film &quot;Space Jam&quot;. He made a cameo appearance alongside Porky Pig in the 2003 film &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, making fun of his politically incorrect status. At around the same time, he made a non-speaking cameo in an episode of &quot;¡Mucha Lucha!&quot; titled &quot;Lucha, Rinse and Repeat&quot;.

Volume 4 of the &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection&quot; DVD series, released on November 14, 2006, has an entire disc of Speedy shorts, although some of his other shorts had previously been released on Volumes 1 and 3. Speedy is mentioned in one &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; episode, after Cadet sits on Dodgers, prompting him to say, &quot;I knew I should&#x27;ve chosen Speedy Gonzales as a sidekick!&quot;

Speedy Gonzales appears in &quot;Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas&quot;. He is an employee at the Lucky Duck Superstore for the greedy Daffy Duck where he confuses Daffy with the Feliz Navidad comment.

Speedy Gonzales also appeared occasionally on &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;. He is seen living with Bugs and Daffy as their &quot;mouse in the wall&quot; and running the pizza parlor Pizzarriba. Speedy is shown to act as Daffy&#x27;s conscience, which is a far cry from the antagonistic relationship they had in the old days. The episode &quot;Sunday Night Slice&quot; showed that Bugs bought his favorite restaurant, Girardi&#x27;s, to prevent it from being closed and hired Speedy to help him. When Bugs decides he does not want to own a restaurant anymore, he hands ownership of it to Speedy. In &quot;The Black Widow&quot;, Speedy Gonzales answers Daffy Duck&#x27;s call and races to Tacapulco to convince his cousin Sheriff Slowpoke Rodriguez to let Daffy Duck and Porky Pig out of jail.

Speedy Gonzales appeared in the 2015 direct-to-video movie &quot;Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run&quot;. He is seen as Lola Bunny&#x27;s landlord.

An elderly Speedy Gonzales (voiced by Carlos Alazraqui) was &quot;interviewed&quot; by Al Madrigal for Madrigal&#x27;s one-hour comedic documentary special &quot;Half Like Me&quot; (currently available on YouTube and formerly on Hulu).

Speedy Gonzales appeared occasionally in &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot;, often as the leader of a gang of mice that also includes Hubie and Bertie, Sniffles, and &quot;Minnesota Rats&quot; (originally Minniesoda Fats; an aborted 1970s character revived and fleshed out in this series). He seems to have reverted to his personality from &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;.

Speedy Gonzales appeared in the &quot;Bugs Bunny Builders&quot; episode &quot;Speedy&quot;, voiced by Raul Ceballos. In the show, he is a professional soccer player and hired the Looney Builders to fly to Mexico and build a soccer stadium for his soccer game with his four teammates. He was featured in a cameo in the episode &quot;The Snuffles&quot;, where he watches the world premiere of the movie &quot;Wonder Rabbit&quot; on his laptop on the soccer field.

==Inspiration of the character&#x27;s name==
Though Speedy Gonzales is purely a fictional character, the name was inspired by Frank Gonzales, an assistant animator who was working at Warner Bros. at the time. These facts were described by another Warner Bros. employee, Martha Goldman Sigall, who was present during the event.

==In other media==
In 1962, pop singer Pat Boone scored a top 10 hit in the United States with the song &quot;Speedy Gonzales&quot; which featured Mel Blanc samples as Speedy. It was covered by Manolo Muñoz and several other artists.

In 1965, the movie &quot;Wild on the Beach&quot; included the song &quot;Little Speedy Gonzales&quot; which was written by Stan Ross and Bobby Beverly and performed by The Astronauts.

In 1995, he appeared in a video game, &quot;Speedy Gonzales: Los Gatos Bandidos&quot;, for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

In 2006, Volkswagen licensed Speedy Gonzales for a series of Spanish-language commercials for the Volkswagen Golf, using footage from the cartoon of the same name.

Speedy Gonzales starred in several video games: &quot;Cheese Cat-Astrophe Starring Speedy Gonzales&quot; for the Mega Drive/Genesis, Master System, and Game Gear, &quot;Speedy Gonzales: Los Gatos Bandidos&quot; for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, &quot;Speedy Gonzales&quot; for the Game Boy and &quot;Speedy Gonzales: Aztec Adventure&quot; for the Game Boy Color. He also appeared as an enemy in &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, and &quot;Looney Tunes: Marvin Strikes Back!&quot; as both a miniboss and playable character.

In the 2018 film &quot;Overboard&quot;, Eugenio Derbez has a tattoo of Gonzales.

==Film adaptation==
In 2010, Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema announced a new Speedy Gonzales live action/animated feature film. George Lopez was attached to voice the character. In December 2015, it was reported that an animated film is in development at Warner Bros. In April 2016, it was announced that Eugenio Derbez will voice the character. In April 2024, during an interview, Eugenio Derbez said that he doubts that the movie will happen saying “I feel that the studios are afraid that, nowadays, it&#x27;s so politically incorrect. I&#x27;ve been telling them constantly that we love Speedy Gonzales in Mexico.

<doc id="102405" wikidata="Q313739" url="?curid=102405" title="John Kennedy Toole">
<text>John Kennedy Toole (; December 17, 1937 – March 26, 1969) was an American novelist from New Orleans, Louisiana, whose posthumously published novel, &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;, won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1981; he also wrote &quot;The Neon Bible&quot;. Although several people in the literary world felt his writing skills were praiseworthy, Toole&#x27;s novels were rejected during his lifetime. Due in part to these failures, he suffered from paranoia and depression, dying by suicide at the age of 31.

Toole was born to a middle-class family in New Orleans. From a young age, his mother, Thelma, taught him an appreciation of culture. She was thoroughly involved in his affairs for most of his life, and at times they had a difficult relationship. With his mother&#x27;s encouragement, Toole became a stage performer at the age of 10 doing comic impressions and acting. At 16 he wrote his first novel, &quot;The Neon Bible&quot;, which he later dismissed as &quot;adolescent&quot;.

Toole received an academic scholarship to Tulane University in New Orleans. After graduating from Tulane, he studied English Literature at Columbia University in New York while teaching simultaneously at Hunter College. He also taught at various Louisiana colleges, and during his early career as an academic he was valued on the faculty party circuit for his wit and gift for mimicry. His studies were interrupted when he was drafted into the army, where he taught English to Spanish-speaking recruits in San Juan, Puerto Rico. After receiving a promotion, he used his private office to begin writing &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;, which he finished at his parents&#x27; home after his discharge.

Toole submitted &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; to publisher Simon &amp; Schuster, where it reached editor Robert Gottlieb. Gottlieb considered Toole talented but felt his comic novel was essentially pointless. Despite several revisions, Gottlieb remained unsatisfied, and after the book was rejected by another literary figure, Hodding Carter Jr., Toole shelved the novel. Suffering from depression and feelings of persecution, Toole left home on a journey around the country. He stopped in Biloxi, Mississippi where he committed suicide by running a garden hose in from the exhaust of his car to the cabin. After his death, his mother brought the manuscript of &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; to the attention of novelist Walker Percy, who was crucial in the book&#x27;s publication. In 1981, Toole was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.

==Early life==
Toole was born to John Dewey Toole, Jr. and Thelma Ducoing Toole. Kennedy was the name of Thelma&#x27;s grandmother. The first of the Creole Ducoing family arrived in Louisiana from France in the early 19th century, and the Tooles immigrated to America from Ireland during the Great Famine of the 1840s. Toole&#x27;s father worked as a car salesman, and his mother, forced to give up her teaching job when she married (as was the custom), gave private lessons in music, speech, and dramatic expression. Toole was known to friends and family as &quot;Ken&quot; until the final few months of his life, when he insisted on being called John. As a child, Toole had an intense affection for his black nursemaid Beulah Matthews, who cared for him when his parents were both working.

Toole&#x27;s highly cultured mother was a controlling woman, especially with her son. His father was less involved and sometimes complained of his lack of influence in their child&#x27;s upbringing. Despite this, he and his father bonded through a mutual interest in baseball and cars. Toole&#x27;s mother chose the friends he could associate with, and felt his cousins on his father&#x27;s side were too common for him to be around. Toole received high marks in elementary school and, from a young age, expressed a desire to excel academically. He skipped ahead a grade, from first to second, after taking an IQ test at the age of six, and would also eventually skip the fourth grade.

When Toole was ten, his mother gathered a group of child stage entertainers she named the Junior Variety Performers. The troupe, with Toole as its star, consisted of 50 children of varying skills and ages. It was well-received, and he also engaged in other entertainment ventures, such as playing the lead in three productions of the Children&#x27;s Workshop Theatre of New Orleans, emceeing a radio show called &quot;Telekids&quot;, modeling for newspaper ads, and developing a solo show of comic impersonations entitled &quot;Great Lovers of the World&quot;.

Although an excellent student, Toole curtailed his stage work when he entered high school (Alcée Fortier High), to concentrate on his academic work. He wrote for the school newspaper &quot;Silver and Blue&quot;, worked on the yearbook &quot;The Tarpon&quot;, and won several essay contests on subjects such as the Louisiana Purchase and the American Merchant Marine. He took up debating, a skill his father had used to win the state debate championship when he was in high school. Toole spoke at gatherings of civic organizations such as Kiwanis and Rotary Clubs. Toole&#x27;s father bought him an Oldsmobile, in which Toole was delivering newspapers at the age of 13, even though the legal driving age was 15. In high school, Toole spent a lot of time at the home of classmate Larry McGee, and dated McGee&#x27;s sister, Jane. Jane later said that Toole never wanted to go home and would purposely spend almost all of his free time at the McGees&#x27;. With the McGees, Toole would engage in mischievous pranks and go on double dates with Larry and his girlfriend, Buzz. The couples spent their free time at the local pool or cruising in Toole&#x27;s car.

As a teenager in 1954, Toole made his first trip out of Louisiana to Philadelphia, New York City, and Washington, D.C., on a field trip. He especially enjoyed New York and filled a cherished scrapbook with pictures from his visit (which included trips on the New York City Subway System, an excursion on a boat in the New York Harbor, visits to the Statue of Liberty, Chinatown, Times Square) and with the program from a performance of The Rockettes he had seen.

Toole became the editor of the news section of the school newspaper, and maintained high marks throughout high school. He received many accolades, including winning a National Merit Scholarship, selection to the National Honor Society, and being named the Most Intelligent Senior Boy by the student body. He was one of two New Orleanians voted outstanding citizen at the Pelican (now Louisiana) Boys State convention and he was invited back to serve the following year as a counsellor. He also took part in the Newman Club, a Catholic organization for teenagers, where he won an award for outstanding student in the group. He received a full scholarship to Tulane University at age 17.

During his senior year, Toole wrote &quot;The Neon Bible&quot;, a short novel of Southern Gothic fiction that has been compared in style to Flannery O&#x27;Connor, a favorite author of Toole’s. The book&#x27;s protagonist, David, had lived with his family in a &quot;little white house in town that had a real roof you could sleep under when it rained,&quot; before his father lost his job forcing them into a small shoddily built home. Set in 1940s Mississippi, the backwoods Baptist community setting is similar to a location to which Toole had traveled with a high-school friend for a literary contest. The novel&#x27;s sudden outburst of violence at the end has been described as incongruous with what preceded it.

Toole later described the novel in correspondence with an editor, &quot;In 1954, when I was 16, I wrote a book called &quot;The Neon Bible&quot;, a grim, adolescent, sociological attack upon the hatreds caused by the various Calvinist religions in the South—and the fundamentalist mentality is one of the roots of what was happening in Alabama, etc. The book, of course, was bad, but I sent it off a couple of times anyway.&quot; &quot;Neon Bible&quot; failed to attract interest from publishers and did not appear in print until after Toole&#x27;s death.

==College studies and professorships==
In high school, Toole, as editor of the school newspaper, had written, under a pseudonym, a column of gossip and wit, &quot;Fish Tales&quot;, and while at Tulane he worked on the college newspaper, the &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, writing articles, reviewing books, and drawing cartoons. The cartoons were noted for their subtlety and sophistication. At Tulane he first majored in engineering on the recommendation of his father; however, after a few weeks, he changed his major to English, stating &quot;I&#x27;m losing my culture&quot; to his mother in explanation. Around this time, Toole began associating with a local blues band that performed at high schools, in the French Quarter, and in the Irish Channel. Toole&#x27;s classmates and family looked down on the French Quarter as being for tourists and the Irish Channel as being a place for lowlifes, so Toole kept his trips there a secret. His closest friend was guitarist Don Stevens, nicknamed &quot;Steve Cha-Cha&quot;, with whom he bonded over their shared love of blues music and Beat poets. Stevens also had a side job pushing a hot tamale cart around town and, on days when he was unavailable for work, Toole would fill in for him. According to Stevens&#x27; bandmate Sidney Snow, Toole loved eating the tamales. Toole later used these experiences as material for his novel &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;, whose protagonist Ignatius J. Reilly pushes a hot dog cart around town, usually eating most of the profits. Also, like Reilly, Toole later worked at a family business that manufactured men&#x27;s clothing, Haspel Brothers. He worked for J.B. Tonkel, who married one of the Haspel daughters. &quot;Ken watched the Haspels&#x27; business dealings with great interest, absorbing and remembering their troubles and intrigues,&quot; and he later constructed the similar Levy Pants Company in &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;, with Gus Levy and his wife becoming significant supporting characters in the novel.

In 1958, Toole graduated from Tulane with honors. He enrolled in Columbia University in New York on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship to study English literature. He took on a heavy workload so that he could earn his master&#x27;s degree in a single year. In his free time he dated Ruth Kathmann, another student from Tulane, who was studying journalism at Columbia. The couple would go dancing at the Roseland Ballroom, as the $2.00 entrance fee allowed them to dance all night and suited their limited budget. Toole was noted to be a talented dancer. There is some question as to whether they were engaged, with friends claiming they were but Kathmann saying only that Toole asked her to marry him, but she declined. After he returned to New Orleans they rarely saw each other, and she married another man. Toole wrote his master&#x27;s essay on the Elizabethan poet John Lyly, which was made easier by the fact that he had also written his honors thesis at Tulane on Lyly.

Toole returned home in 1959 to spend a year as assistant professor of English at the University of Southwestern Louisiana (USL), since renamed the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Joel L. Fletcher, a close friend, noted, &quot;Ken has a real gift for mimicry and a refined sense of the absurd ... the English faculty at USL, which is divided into several camps of war, both fear and court Ken because of his biting comic talent.&quot; This year is generally considered one of the happiest of his life. While at USL he rented a dilapidated apartment from an elderly and eccentric widow on Convent Street. Toole described the apartment as a &quot;Conradian metaphor&quot; to friends.

Toole was in constant demand and went to all the parties where it was said &quot;he was encouraged and sometimes forced to perform, Ken would enter a room armed with quiver full of sharp stories and barbed one-liners. He would zing these out until his audience was weak with laughter, though he hadn&#x27;t cracked a smile.&quot; Because he was saving for a return to Columbia to get his Ph.D., Toole was a notorious skinflint during his year at USL. His friends noticed this and forced him to pay for and throw a party at his home. The party was a success and generally considered the best party thrown that year. In contrast to this image of an outgoing, lively young man, when Toole&#x27;s mother came to visit, friends noticed that he became sullen and withdrawn. His friend Pat Rickels commented that Thelma &quot;was absolutely convinced that he was without flaw and that all the hopes of the world lay in him. It was an extreme form of maternalism, where all your pride and all your hopes are in one person. He had to grow up with that burden. She was a very ostentatious, shrill, loud-voiced, bossy, bragging woman.&quot;

It was at USL that Toole met Bob Byrne, an eccentric English professor who is considered one of the primary inspirations for the character of Ignatius J. Reilly. Byrne specialized in the medieval period, and he and Toole frequently discussed the philosopher Boethius and the wheel of Fortuna, as described in Boethius&#x27; &quot;Consolation of Philosophy&quot;. Boethius was the favorite philosopher of Ignatius J. Reilly, who frequently referred to Fortuna and &quot;Consolation of Philosophy&quot;. Like Ignatius, Byrne was a self-admitted devoted slob who played the lute, and also wore a deerstalker hunting cap, which Toole frequently chided him about.

When he was not studying or on the faculty party circuit, Toole frequented country bars and drank beer. He would usually listen to singer Frances Faye, whom he had once heard perform in New York. On several occasions while listening to her music with friends he enigmatically remarked, &quot;Is Frances Faye God?&quot; He was also an avid Marilyn Monroe fan who was devastated by her death and once described his interest in her as having &quot;reached the stage of obsession&quot;.

In May 1960, Toole accepted a three-year fellowship to study for a Ph.D. in Renaissance literature at the University of Washington at Seattle. However, when he was offered a teaching position at Hunter College in New York, which suited his desire to study at Columbia, he chose to go there instead. At 22, he became the youngest professor in Hunter&#x27;s history. Although he pursued a doctorate at Columbia, he became unhappy with his Ph.D. However, he wrote to Fletcher that he still liked Hunter, &quot;principally because the aggressive, pseudo-intellectual, &#x27;liberal&#x27; girl students are continuously amusing.&quot; Fletcher surmised that from these girls the character of Myrna Minkoff from &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; was born. Toole, although generally only a &quot;Christmas-and-Easter churchgoer&quot;, had some apprehension about the anti-Catholic intellectualism of some of his students, and about their seeming ever watchful for a cause they could throw their liberal zeal behind. &quot;Every time the elevator door opens at Hunter, you are confronted by 20 pairs of burning eyes, 20 sets of bangs and everyone waiting for someone to push a Negro&quot; he is reported to have said. When he first arrived back in New York, Toole dated Emilie Dietrich Griffin, another Louisiana transplant, with whom he had worked on the &quot;Hullabaloo&quot; staff, and later he dated another Louisianan, Clayelle Dalferes, of whom he had learned through Fletcher. The couple loved the cinema and movie-going was a constant staple of their dates. Both women said their relationships with Toole never progressed beyond the level of a good night kiss.

==Military service==
Toole&#x27;s studies were interrupted by his being drafted into the United States Army in 1961. Toole (who was fluent in Spanish) served two years at Fort Buchanan in Puerto Rico, teaching English to Spanish-speaking recruits. He rose quickly in the military ranks. In under a year, he attained the rank of sergeant, and received numerous awards and citations. While serving in Puerto Rico, he frequently traveled throughout the Caribbean, either alone or with members of his company. Toole, however, began to dread the frustrations of military life and the oppressive heat of Puerto Rico. He described his work there in a letter to a friend:

He also engaged in one of the favorite activities of military personnel on the island: alcohol consumption. Both the soldiers and the instructors at the base drank excessively, as alcohol was cheap and plentiful. Toole remarked in another letter to Fletcher, &quot;We are all rotting here at the moment. The decreased draft has meant no trainees since June ... the inactivity here, coupled with the remnants of a rainy and enervating summer has (have?) plunged the English instructors into an abyss of drinking and inertia. Occasionally someone will struggle off to the beach or to San Juan, but the maxim here remains, &#x27;It&#x27;s too hot. When Emilie Griffin paid Toole a visit in December 1961 she was dismayed at what she saw. Toole was notably depressed and while dining at a local hotel she noted that &quot;the windows on all sides of our table were filled with perfect rainbows. Ken was sitting in a pocket of darkness surrounded by these brilliant colored arches and he never looked at them.&quot; Adding to Toole&#x27;s dismay, his class ring from Tulane went missing and he searched the entire base for it, questioning everyone, until concluding that it had been stolen. Disgusted, he wrote home, &quot;It&#x27;s a wonder I haven&#x27;t been stabbed yet or paralyzed by intestinal diseases on this insane little geographical mountain top protruding from the Caribbean. However, under any circumstances the loss of the ring affects me deeply.&quot;

In the early portion of Toole&#x27;s military career one of his primary motivations for advancement was to acquire a private office. Privacy was a significant luxury on the island with some of the men renting rooms in nearby hotels so they could have some solitude. Toole&#x27;s army buddy David Kubach, also an aspiring writer, lent him a green Swedish-made Halda typewriter for use in his office. The barracks consisted solely of college educated English professors, which gave it a different makeup from usual army companies. In contrast to almost all other army barracks where gays kept their sexual orientation a secret, this barracks had a contingent of men who were open about their homosexuality. The gay men reserved a portion of the barracks for themselves and, as they did not proposition any of the straight instructors, they were left alone. However, this particular group of gay men drank significantly more than the rest of the group and eventually began to exhibit a loud, rowdy, and vulgar brand of behavior that made the straight men uncomfortable. Toole&#x27;s response was to ignore their behavior and it lost him the respect of some of the men in the barracks. The problem came to a head when a gay instructor attempted suicide by overdosing on APC (aspirin, phenacetin, and caffeine) tablets after being spurned by another soldier. When Toole found the man he waited a half-hour to call for help, hoping he would awaken on his own. His friend Kubach stated that this was because it would look bad for the soldier and that he would most likely get himself court martialed for a suicide attempt. Some of his fellow soldiers were livid and held a meeting deciding whether to report Toole&#x27;s negligence. Ultimately, they did not report his behavior and the army never filed any charges but his relationships with many of the men were irrevocably changed.

After this incident, Toole became withdrawn and began spending more and more time in his office typing what would eventually become his master work, &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;. It was not a secret that Toole was writing a book. Late at night, his fellow soldiers could often hear the sound of the typewriter keys. Although he was secretive about the novel among the other men, Toole showed the early portions of it to Kubach who gave him positive feedback. Around this time, Kubach was transferred and took his typewriter with him, so Toole was forced to buy his own. He later commented that he began to &quot;talk and act like Ignatius&quot; during this period as he became more and more immersed in the creation of the book. His letter home to his parents of April 10, 1963, shows these similarities:

==Return home and completion of &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;==
Toole received a hardship discharge as his parents were having difficult economic times, his father struggling with deafness and an increasing incidence of irrational fear and paranoia. Toole looked forward to coming home and spending time talking with his mother. Toole turned down an offer to return to his post at Hunter, and arrived home to a teaching position at Dominican College, a Catholic all-female school. He initially liked the position as it allowed him to teach for only 10.5 hours a week and afforded him the same leisure time he had during his less active periods in the service. The nuns on the faculty were enamored of Toole from the start, considering him well mannered, genteel, and charming. He used his free time to work on his novel, and to spend some time with his musician friend Sidney Snow at Snow&#x27;s home in the Irish Channel and at various night clubs where he would watch Snow and his bandmates perform, among other things, covers of songs by The Beatles. The November 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy caused Toole to fall into severe depression. He stopped writing and drank heavily. In February 1964 he resumed writing, at which point he added an ending and sent the manuscript to Simon &amp; Schuster.

&quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; has been described as a &quot;grand comic fugue&quot; and is considered one of the seminal works of twentieth century Southern literature. It has received praise for its accurate use of various New Orleans dialects, including the Yat dialect. It concerns protagonist Ignatius J. Reilly, a slothful, obese, self-styled philosopher who lives with his mother. After an early financial setback for the Reilly family, caused by Ignatius, he is forced by his mother to seek employment in a variety of menial jobs to help the household financially, for which he is continually resentful of her. He subsequently takes revenge on several businesses for perceived slights. He incites black workers to insurrection at Levy Pants Company, eats more hot dogs than he sells, and attempts to break up a strip club. Along the way he runs into a divergent cast of characters, including Myrna Minkoff, a rebellious socialist intellectual with whom he conducts an ongoing literary correspondence. Although Reilly is partially modeled after Toole&#x27;s eccentric friend Bob Byrne, Byrne and others have stated that much of Reilly is actually based on Toole himself:

The book eventually reached senior editor Robert Gottlieb, who had talked the then-unknown Joseph Heller into completing the classic comic novel &quot;Catch-22&quot;. Gottlieb and Toole began a two-year correspondence and dialogue over the novel which would ultimately result in bitter disappointment on both sides. While Gottlieb felt Toole was undoubtedly talented, he was unhappy with the book in its original form. He felt that it had one basic flaw which he expressed to Toole in an early letter:


Initially, although Toole was disappointed that the novel could not be published as is, he was exuberant that a major publisher was interested in it. He entered his second year of teaching at Dominican as one of the favorite new professors on staff. Students marveled at his wit, and Toole would make entire classes burst into laughter while hardly showing any expression. He never retold a story or joke, and had many repeat students. Shortly before Christmas break in 1964, Toole received a letter from Gottlieb. In it Gottlieb remarked that he had shown the novel to Candida Donadio, a literary agent whose clients included Joseph Heller and Thomas Pynchon. Gottlieb told Toole they felt he was &quot;... wildly funny often, funnier than almost anyone around&quot;. Also they liked the same portions and characters of the book and disliked the same parts as well. Gottlieb gave a list of things he did not like concluding with:

Later on in the letter, Gottlieb stated that he still had faith in Toole as a writer and that he wished to hold onto the manuscript in case he or Toole would be able to see a way around his objections. Toole decided that it would be best for Gottlieb to return the manuscript, saying &quot;Aside from a few deletions, I don&#x27;t think I could really do much to the book now—and of course even with revisions you might not be satisfied.&quot; Toole made a trip to New York to see Gottlieb in person; however, he was out of town and Toole came back disappointed. He felt that he had embarrassed himself by giving a rambling, uncomfortable speech explaining his situation to one of Gottlieb&#x27;s office staff. He returned home having left a note for Gottlieb to call him, and they later talked for an hour on the phone. In this conversation Gottlieb reiterated that he would not accept the novel without further revision. He suggested that Toole move on to writing something else, an idea which Toole ultimately rejected.

In a long, partially autobiographical letter he sent to Gottlieb in March 1965, Toole explained that he could not give up on the book since he wrote the novel largely from personal observation and because the characters were based on real people he had seen in his life.

Gottlieb wrote him an encouraging letter, in which he stated again that he felt Toole was very talented (even more so than himself) and that if Toole were to re-submit the manuscript he would continue to &quot;read, reread, edit, perhaps publish, generally cope, until you are fed up with me. What more can I say?&quot; In early 1966, Toole wrote Gottlieb one final letter, which has never been located. Gottlieb wrote back to him on January 17, 1966, reiterating his feelings on the book and stating that he wanted to read it again when Toole created another revision.

==Final years==

Toole took the rejection of the book in his intended form as a tremendous personal blow. He eventually ceased work on &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; and for a time left it atop an armoire in his bedroom. He continued to teach at Dominican where he remained a favorite among the student body with his classes regularly filling up well before official registration. His comedic performances during lectures remained especially popular. He attempted to work on another novel which he titled &quot;The Conqueror Worm&quot;, a reference to death as portrayed in Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s poem of the same name, but he found little peace at home. Toole&#x27;s mother persuaded him to take &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; to Hodding Carter Jr., who was well known as a reporter and publisher for the &quot;Delta Democrat Times&quot; in Greenville, Mississippi, and was spending a semester teaching at Tulane. Carter showed little interest in the book but complimented him on it. This face-to-face rejection drove Toole further into despair, and he became angry with his mother for causing him further embarrassment.

Except for a few trips by car to Madison, Wisconsin to see army pal David Kubach, Toole spent most of the last three years of his life at home or at Dominican. In the winter of 1967, Kubach, who had come down to visit Toole, noticed an increased sense of paranoia on Toole&#x27;s part; once when driving around New Orleans, Toole became convinced they were being followed and attempted to lose the car. The family moved to a larger rental house on Hampson Street, and Toole continued teaching, with his students noticing that his wit had become more acerbic. He continued to drink heavily and gained a great deal of weight, causing him to have to purchase an entire new wardrobe. Toole began having frequent and intense headaches; because aspirin was no help, he saw a doctor. The doctor&#x27;s treatment was ineffective, and he suggested that Toole see a neurologist, an idea Toole rejected.
Toole tried to maintain a sense of normality and enrolled in Tulane in the fall of 1968 with the hopes of acquiring a Ph.D. He took a course studying Theodore Dreiser, on whom he had lectured while at Hunter, and was particularly interested in Dreiser&#x27;s close relationship with his mother and his anti-Catholic beliefs. The assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 added to his feelings of grief and heightened his paranoia. Several of Toole&#x27;s longtime friends noticed he had an increasing sense of feelings of personal persecution. Toole went to see his friend Bob Byrne at his home in August 1968, where he again expressed sadness and humiliation that his book would not be published. Toole told Byrne that people were passing his home late in the night and honking their car horns at him, that students whispered about him behind his back, and that people were plotting against him. Byrne had a talk with him, which he felt, for the time being, calmed him down.

In the months before his suicide, Toole, who was usually extremely well groomed, &quot;began to appear in public unshaved and uncombed, wearing unpolished shoes and wrinkled clothes, to the amazement of his friends and students in New Orleans.&quot; He also began to exhibit signs of paranoia, including telling friends that a woman who he erroneously thought had worked for Simon &amp; Schuster was plotting to steal his book so that her husband, the novelist George Deaux, could publish it.

Toole became increasingly erratic during his lectures at Dominican, resulting in frequent student complaints, and was given to rants against church and state. Toward the end of the 1968 fall semester, he was forced to take a leave of absence and stopped attending classes at Tulane, resulting in his receiving a grade of incomplete. The Tooles spent Christmas of 1968 in disarray with Toole&#x27;s father in an increasing state of dementia, and Toole searching the home for electronic mind-reading devices.

==Death==

When Toole was unable to resume his position at Dominican in January 1969, the school had to hire another professor. This upset his mother and on January 19, 1969, they had an argument. He stopped by the house the next day to pick up some things and spoke only to his father, as Thelma was out at the grocery store. He left home for the final time and withdrew $1,500 (equivalent to $12,500 in 2022) from his savings account. After a week she called the police, but, without any evidence as to his whereabouts, they took a report and waited for him to surface. Thelma became convinced that Toole&#x27;s friends the Rickels knew where he was and called them repeatedly, even though they denied knowing where he had gone.
Items found in Toole&#x27;s car show that he drove to California where he visited Hearst Castle and then to Milledgeville, Georgia. Here he most likely attempted to visit Andalusia, the home of deceased writer Flannery O&#x27;Connor, although her house was not open to the public. This was succeeded by a drive toward New Orleans. It was during this trip that he stopped outside Biloxi, Mississippi, and died by suicide by running a garden hose from the exhaust pipe in through the window of his car on March 26, 1969. His car and person were clean, and the police officers who found him reported that his face showed no signs of distress. An envelope discovered in the car was marked &quot;to my parents&quot;. The suicide note inside the envelope was destroyed by his mother, who later gave varying vague accounts of its details. In one instance she said it expressed his &quot;concerned feeling for her&quot; and later she told a &quot;Times-Picayune&quot; interviewer that the letter was &quot;bizarre and preposterous. Violent. Ill-fated. Nothing. Insane ravings.&quot; He was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in New Orleans. A few years earlier, Toole had driven his army buddy David Kubach to the exact spot where he would later die by suicide. As the location was unremarkable, Kubach did not understand why Toole had taken him there. He left his parents a $2,000 life-insurance policy (equivalent to $ in ), several thousand dollars in savings, and his car. Toole&#x27;s funeral service was private and attended only by his parents and his childhood nursemaid Beulah Matthews. The students and faculty at Dominican College were grief-stricken over Toole&#x27;s death, and the school held a memorial service for him in the college courtyard. The head of Dominican gave a brief eulogy which, because of the institution&#x27;s religious beliefs, did not mention the suicide.

==Posthumous publications==
After Toole&#x27;s death, Thelma Toole suffered from depression for two years, and the manuscript for &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; remained atop an armoire in his former room. She then determined to find a publisher, believing it would be an opportunity to prove her son&#x27;s talent. Over a five-year period, she sent it to seven publishers, but all rejected it. &quot;Each time it came back, I died a little,&quot; she said. However, in 1976 she became aware that author Walker Percy was joining the faculty of Loyola University New Orleans. To get Percy to read the manuscript, Thelma began a campaign of phone calls and letters. Percy complained to his wife about a peculiar old woman&#x27;s attempts to contact him. With time running out on Percy&#x27;s term as professor, Thelma pushed her way into his office and demanded he read the manuscript. Initially hesitant, Percy agreed to read the book to stop her badgering. He admitted to hoping it would be so bad that he could discard it after reading a few pages. Ultimately, he loved the book, commenting in disbelief:

Despite Percy&#x27;s great admiration for the book, the road to publication was difficult. Acceptance took more than three years; he attempted to get several parties interested in it. &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; was published by Louisiana State University Press in 1980, and Percy provided the foreword. At his recommendation, Toole&#x27;s first draft of the book was published with minimal copy-editing, and no significant revisions. The first printing was only 2,500 copies, and a number of these were sent to Scott Kramer, an executive at 20th Century Fox, to pitch around Hollywood, but the book initially generated little interest. However, the novel attracted much attention in the literary world. A year later, in 1981, Toole was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. The book eventually sold more than 1.5 million copies, in 18 languages. In 2019, the PBS show &quot;The Great American Read&quot; ranked &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; the 58th (out of 100) most loved book in America.

Toole&#x27;s only other novel, &quot;The Neon Bible&quot;, was published in 1989. It was adapted into a feature film in 1995, directed by Terence Davies, that fared poorly at the box office and received a mixed critical reception.

In 2015, debuting on November 11 and running through December 13, Nick Offerman, star of the TV series &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, starred in a theatrical performance of &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;, adapted by Jeffrey Hatcher and directed by David Esbjornson. The play was staged at the Huntington Theatre in Boston.

Thelma Toole&#x27;s tenacity in attempting to publish &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; is such that many manuscripts were circulated, thus making it difficult to determine which is the &quot;original.&quot; The Loyola University New Orleans and Tulane University archives retain early versions of the manuscript.

<text>J. J. Johnson (January 22, 1924 – February 4, 2001), born James Louis Johnson and also known as Jay Jay Johnson, was an American jazz trombonist, composer and arranger.

Johnson was one of the earliest trombonists to embrace bebop.

== Biography ==
=== Big bands ===
After studying the piano beginning at age 9, Johnson decided to play trombone at the age of 14. In 1941, he began his professional career with Clarence Love, and then played with Snookum Russell in 1942. In Russell&#x27;s band, he met the trumpeter Fats Navarro, who influenced him to play in the style of the tenor saxophonist Lester Young. Johnson played in Benny Carter&#x27;s orchestra between 1942 and 1945, and made his first recordings in 1943 under Carter&#x27;s leadership, recording his first solo (on &quot;Love for Sale&quot;) in October 1943. In 1944, he took part in the first &quot;Jazz at the Philharmonic&quot; concert, presented in Los Angeles and organized by Norman Granz. In 1945, he joined the big band of Count Basie, touring and recording with him until 1946.

=== Bebop ===
While the trombone was featured prominently in dixieland and swing music, it fell out of favor among bebop musicians, largely because instruments with valves and keys (trumpet, saxophone) were believed to be more suited to bebop&#x27;s often rapid tempos and demand for technical mastery. In 1946, bebop co-founder Dizzy Gillespie encouraged the young trombonist&#x27;s development: &quot;I&#x27;ve always known that the trombone could be played different, that somebody&#x27;d catch on one of these days. Man, you&#x27;re elected.&quot;

After leaving Basie in 1946 to play in small bebop bands in New York clubs, Johnson toured in 1947 with Illinois Jacquet. During this period, he also began recording as a leader of small groups featuring Max Roach, Sonny Stitt and Bud Powell. He performed with Charlie Parker at the 17 December 1947 Dial Records session, following Parker&#x27;s release from Camarillo State Mental Hospital.

In 1951, with bassist Oscar Pettiford and trumpeter Howard McGhee, Johnson toured the military camps of Japan and Korea, before returning to the United States and taking a day job as a blueprint inspector. Johnson admitted later he was still thinking of nothing but music during that time, and indeed, his Blue Note recordings as both a leader and with Miles Davis date from this period. Johnson&#x27;s compositions &quot;Enigma&quot; and &quot;Kelo&quot; were recorded by Davis for Blue Note, and Johnson was part of the Davis studio session band that recorded the jazz standard &quot;Walkin&#x27;&quot; in 1954 (the title track of a Davis album issued by Prestige).

===Jay and Kai===
In 1954, producer Ozzie Cadena, then with Savoy Records, convinced Johnson to set up a combo with trombonist Kai Winding: the &quot;Jay and Kai Quintet&quot;. The trombone styles and personalities of the two musicians, although very different, blended so well that the pairing, which lasted until August 1956, was a success both musically and commercially. They toured U.S. nightclubs and recorded numerous albums. The duo reunited again in 1958 for a tour of the UK, an Impulse! studio album in 1960 and, in 1968–1969, (two albums for CTI/A&amp;M Records). In January 1967, Johnson and Winding were in an all-star line-up (alongside the likes of Clark Terry, Charlie Shavers and Joe Newman) backing Sarah Vaughan on her last sessions for Mercury Records, released as the album &quot;Sassy Swings Again&quot;, with three of the cuts, including Billy Strayhorn&#x27;s &quot;Take the &quot;A&quot; Train&quot;, being arranged by Johnson himself. The duo also made some jazz festival appearances in Japan in the early 1980s, the last shortly before Winding died in May 1983.

===Solo career===
Following the mid-1950s collaboration with Winding, J. J. Johnson began leading his own touring small groups for about three years, covering the United States, United Kingdom and Scandinavia. These groups (ranging from quartets to sextets) included tenor saxophonists Bobby Jaspar and Clifford Jordan, cornetist Nat Adderley, trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, pianists Tommy Flanagan and Cedar Walton, and drummers Elvin Jones, Albert &quot;Tootie&quot; Heath, and Roach. In 1957, he recorded the quartet albums &quot;First Place&quot; and &quot;Blue Trombone&quot;, with Flanagan, Paul Chambers and Roach. He also toured with the Jazz at the Philharmonic show in 1957 and 1960, the first tour yielding a live album, featuring Johnson and tenor saxophonist Stan Getz. In 1958–59, Johnson was one of three plaintiffs in a court case which hastened the abolition of the cabaret card system.

This period overlaps with the beginnings of Johnson&#x27;s serious forays into Third Stream music (see below). Periods of writing and recording his music would alternate with tours demanding attention to his playing.

Following the six months he spent writing &quot;Perceptions&quot; (see below), Johnson entered the studio for a date with André Previn&#x27;s trio (adding Johnson as the only horn). They recorded an entire album of the music of Kurt Weill, released as &quot;Andre Previn and J. J. Johnson Play &#x27;Mack The Knife&#x27; and Other Kurt Weill Songs&quot;. In 1962, Johnson toured for a number of months with Davis&#x27; sextet of that year, which went unrecorded.

Johnson&#x27;s 1963 album &quot;J. J.&#x27;s Broadway&quot; is an example of both his mature trombone style and sound, and his arranging abilities. Johnson&#x27;s album &quot;Proof Positive&quot; (1964) was the last recording of his working band for over 20 years. Beginning in 1965, Johnson recorded a number of large group studio albums under his name, featuring many of his own compositions and arrangements. The late 1960s saw a radical downturn in the fortunes of many jazz musicians, and Johnson was consequently heard almost exclusively on big band-style studio records, usually backing a single soloist.

===Composer===
From the mid-1950s, but especially the early 1960s on, Johnson dedicated more and more time to composition. He became an active contributor to the Third Stream movement in jazz, (which included such other musicians as Gunther Schuller and John Lewis), and wrote large-scale works which incorporated elements of both classical music and jazz. He contributed his &quot;Poem for Brass&quot; to a Third Stream compilation titled &quot;Music for Brass&quot; in 1957, and composed a number of original works which were performed at the Monterey Jazz Festival in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In 1961, he composed a suite in six movements, titled &quot;Perceptions&quot;, with Gillespie as soloist. The First International Jazz Festival, held in Washington, D.C. in 1962, featured another extended work. In 1965, he spent time in Vienna to perform and record his &quot;Euro Suite&quot; with a jazz-classical fusion orchestra led by Friedrich Gulda. In 1968, a Johnson work titled &quot;Diversions&quot; was commissioned by the American Wind Symphony and performed.

===Hollywood===
Johnson moved to California to compose for cinema and television. During this period, he played almost no concerts, except in 1977 and 1982 in Japan, and in 1984 in Europe. Despite the low profile, he did record six albums as a leader between 1977 and 1984 (including a 1984 trombone duo album with Al Grey) and a few albums as a sideman, two with Basie, and on &quot;The Sting II&quot; soundtrack. During the California period he also played in the Cocoanut Grove orchestra of Sammy Davis Jr. and the TV orchestra of Carol Burnett.

===Return to performing===
Johnson returned to performing and recording in November 1987, with an engagement at the Village Vanguard in New York City. Tours of the United States, Europe and Japan followed as well as a return engagement to the Vanguard in July 1988 which yielded two albums worth of material.

While touring Japan in December 1988, Johnson learned that his wife Vivian had suffered a bad stroke, which incapacitated her for the remaining three and a half years of her life. During this period Johnson cancelled all work, devoting his energy to caring for his ailing wife. After her death in 1991, he dedicated an album to her on Concord.

In 1992, Johnson married his second wife, Carolyn Reid, and he began actively performing once again. Following this second comeback in 1992, Johnson&#x27;s contracts with a variety of record labels, including Verve and Antilles, resulted in five albums as a leader, from small groups to separate brass orchestra and string orchestra recordings, as well as sideman appearances with his leading disciple, trombonist Steve Turre, and the vocalist Abbey Lincoln. He earned several Grammy nominations during this period. He retired from active performing and touring in late 1996, after having performed his last concert at William Paterson College on November 10, 1996, then choosing to stay at his home in Indianapolis where he could indulge his passion of composing and arranging music with computers and MIDI.

Later diagnosed with prostate cancer, Johnson maintained a positive outlook and underwent treatment. He wrote a book of original exercises and études for jazz musicians, published later by Hal Leonard. A biography, titled &quot;The Musical World of J. J. Johnson&quot;, was published in 2000.

On February 4, 2001, he died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound. His funeral in Indianapolis drew jazz musicians, friends and family from around the country.

==Influence==
Johnson&#x27;s work in the 1940s and 1950s demonstrated that the slide trombone could be played in the bebop style; as trombonist Steve Turre has summarized, &quot;J. J. did for the trombone what Charlie Parker did for the saxophone. And all of us that are playing today wouldn&#x27;t be playing the way we&#x27;re playing if it wasn&#x27;t for what he did. And not only, of course, is he the master of the trombone—the definitive master of this century—but, as a composer and arranger, he is in the top shelf as well.&quot;

Several of Johnson&#x27;s compositions, including &quot;Wee Dot&quot;, &quot;Lament&quot;, and &quot;Enigma&quot; have become jazz standards.

From the mid-1950s onwards, Johnson was a perennial polling favorite in jazz circles, even winning &quot;Trombonist of the Year&quot; in &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine during years he was not active. He was voted into the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Hall of Fame in 1995.

<doc id="102411" wikidata="Q199414" url="?curid=102411" title="Bog body">
<text>A bog body is a human cadaver that has been naturally mummified in a peat bog. Such bodies, sometimes known as bog people, are both geographically and chronologically widespread, having been dated to between 8000 BC and the Second World War. The unifying factor of the bog bodies is that they have been found in peat and are partially preserved; however, the actual levels of preservation vary widely from perfectly preserved to mere skeletons.

Unlike most ancient human remains, bog bodies often retain their skin and internal organs due to the unusual conditions of the surrounding area. Combined, highly acidic water, low temperature, and a lack of oxygen preserve but severely tan their skin. While the skin is well-preserved, the bones are generally not, due to the dissolution of the calcium phosphate of bone by the peat&#x27;s acidity. The acidic conditions of these bogs allow for the preservation of materials such as skin, hair, nails, wool and leather which all contain the protein keratin.

The oldest known bog body is the skeleton of Koelbjerg Man from Denmark, which has been dated to 8000 BC, during the Mesolithic period. The oldest fleshed bog body is that of Cashel Man, which dates to 2000 BC during the Bronze Age. The overwhelming majority of bog bodies – including examples such as Tollund Man, Grauballe Man and Lindow Man – date to the Iron Age and have been found in northwest Europe, particularly Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Sweden, Poland, and Ireland. Such Iron Age bog bodies typically show a number of similarities, such as violent deaths and a lack of clothing, which has led archaeologists to believe that they were killed and deposited in the bogs as a part of a widespread cultural tradition of human sacrifice or executed as criminals. Bogs could have indeed been seen as liminal places positively connected to another world, which might welcome contaminating items otherwise dangerous to the living. More recent theories postulate that bog people were perceived as social outcasts or &quot;witches&quot;, as legal hostages killed in anger over broken treaty arrangements, or as victims of an unusual death eventually buried in bogs according to traditional customs.

The German scientist Alfred Dieck published a catalogue of more than 1,850 bog bodies that he had counted between 1939 and 1986, but most were unverified by documents or archaeological finds; and a 2002 analysis of Dieck&#x27;s work by German archaeologists concluded that much of his work was unreliable. Countering Dieck&#x27;s findings of more than 1400 bog body discoveries, it seems that after a more recent study the number of bog body finds is closer to 122. The most recent bog bodies are those of soldiers killed in the wetlands of the Soviet Union during the Second World War.

== Bog chemistry ==
The preservation of bog bodies in peat bogs is a natural phenomenon and not the result of human mummification processes. It is caused by the unique physical and biochemical composition of the bogs. Different types of bogs can affect the mummification process differently: raised bogs best preserve the corpses, whereas fens and transitional bogs tend to preserve harder tissues such as the skeleton rather than the soft tissue.

A limited number of bogs have the correct conditions for preservation of mammalian tissue. Most of these are located in colder climates near bodies of salt water. For example, in the area of Denmark where the Haraldskær Woman was recovered, salty air from the North Sea blows across the Jutland wetlands and provides an ideal environment for the growth of peat. As new peat replaces the old peat, the older material underneath rots and releases humic acid, also known as bog acid. The bog acids, with pH levels similar to vinegar, preserve human bodies in the same way as fruit is preserved by pickling. In addition, peat bogs form in areas lacking drainage and hence are characterized by almost completely anaerobic conditions. This environment, highly acidic and devoid of oxygen, denies the prevalent subsurface aerobic organisms any opportunity to initiate decomposition. Researchers discovered that preservation also requires that the body is placed in the bog during the winter or early spring when the water temperature is coldi.e., less than . This allows bog acids to saturate the tissues before decay can begin. Bacteria are unable to grow rapidly enough for decomposition at temperatures under 4 °C.

The bog chemical environment involves a completely saturated acidic environment, where considerable concentrations of organic acids, which contribute most to the low pH of bog waters, and aldehydes are present. Layers of sphagnum, which are compacted layers of irregular mosses and other peat debris, and peat assist in preserving the cadavers by enveloping the tissue in a cold immobilizing matrix, impeding water circulation and any oxygenation. An additional feature of anaerobic preservation by acidic bogs is the ability to conserve hair, clothing and leather items. Modern experimenters have been able to mimic bog conditions in the laboratory and successfully demonstrated the preservation process, albeit over shorter time frames than the 2,500 years that Haraldskær Woman&#x27;s body has survived. Most of the bog bodies discovered showed some aspects of decay or else were not properly conserved. When such specimens are exposed to the normal atmosphere, they may begin to decompose rapidly. As a result, many specimens have been effectively destroyed. As of 1979, the number of specimens that have been preserved following discovery was 53.

==Historical context==
===Mesolithic to Bronze Age===
The oldest bog body that has been identified is the Koelbjerg Man from Denmark, which has been dated to 8000 BC, during the Mesolithic period.

Around 3900 BC, agriculture was introduced to Denmark, either through cultural exchange or by migrating farmers, marking the beginning of the Neolithic in the region. It was during the early part of this Neolithic period that a number of human corpses that were interred in the area&#x27;s peat bogs left evidence that there had been resistance to its introduction. A disproportionate number of the Early Neolithic bodies found in Danish bogs were aged between 16 and 20 at the time of their death and deposition, and suggestions have been put forward that they were either human sacrifices or criminals executed for their socially deviant behaviour. An example of a Bronze Age bog body is Cashel Man, from 2000 BC.

===Iron Age===

The vast majority of the bog bodies that have been discovered date from the Iron Age, a period of time when peat bogs covered a much larger area of northern Europe. Many of these Iron Age bodies bear a number of similarities, indicating a known cultural tradition of killing and depositing these people in a certain manner. These Pre-Roman Iron Age people lived in sedentary communities and built villages. Their society was hierarchical. They were agriculturalists, raising animals in captivity as well as growing crops. In some parts of northern Europe, they also fished. Although independent of the Roman Empire, which dominated southern Europe at this time, the inhabitants traded with the Romans.

For these people, the bogs held some sort of liminal significance, and indeed, they placed into them votive offerings intended for the Otherworld, often of neck-rings, wristlets or ankle-rings made of bronze or more rarely gold. The archaeologist P. V. Glob believed that these were &quot;offerings to the gods of fertility and good fortune.&quot; It is therefore widely speculated that the Iron Age bog bodies were thrown into the bog for similar reasons and that they were therefore examples of human sacrifice to the gods. Explicit reference to the practice of drowning slaves who had washed the cult image of Nerthus and were subsequently ritually drowned in Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Germania&quot;, suggesting that the bog bodies were sacrificial victims may be contrasted with a separate account (&quot;Germania&quot; XII), in which victims of punitive execution were pinned in bogs using hurdles.

Many bog bodies show signs of being stabbed, bludgeoned, hanged or strangled, or a combination of these methods. In some cases, the individual had been beheaded. In the case of the Osterby Man found at Kohlmoor, near Osterby, Germany, in 1948, the head had been deposited in the bog without its body.

Usually, the corpses were naked, sometimes with some items of clothing with them, particularly headgear. The clothing is believed to have decomposed while in the bog for so long. In a number of cases, twigs, sticks or stones were placed on top of the body, sometimes in a cross formation, and at other times, forked sticks had been driven into the peat to hold the corpse down. According to the archaeologist P. V. Glob, &quot;this probably indicates the wish to pin the dead man firmly into the bog&quot;. Some bodies show signs of torture, such as Old Croghan Man, who had deep cuts beneath his nipples.

Some bog bodies, such as Tollund Man from Denmark, have been found with the rope used to strangle them still around their necks. Similarly to Tollund Man, Yde Girl, who was found in the Netherlands and was approximately 16 years old at her time of death, has a woollen rope with a sliding knot still tied around her neck. Yde Girl&#x27;s remains showed evidence indicating that she had sustained trauma prior to her death. Aside from the rope preserved around her neck indicating strangulation, near her left clavicle there are marks indicating that she was also subjected to sharp force trauma. Yde Girl, and other bog bodies in Ireland, had the hair on one side of their heads closely cropped, although this could be due to one side of their head being exposed to oxygen for a longer period of time than the other. Some of the bog bodies seem consistently to have been members of the upper class: their fingernails are manicured, and tests on hair protein routinely record good nutrition. Strabo records that the Celts practised auguries on the entrails of human victims: on some bog bodies, such as the Weerdinge Men found in the northern Netherlands, the entrails have been partly drawn out through incisions.

Modern techniques of forensic analysis now suggest that some injuries, such as broken bones and crushed skulls, were not the result of torture, but rather due to the weight of the bog. For example, the fractured skull of Grauballe Man was at one time thought to have been caused by a blow to the head. However, a CT scan of Grauballe Man by Danish scientists determined his skull was fractured due to pressure from the bog long after his death.

===North America===
A number of skeletons found in Florida have been called &quot;bog people&quot;. These skeletons are the remains of people buried in peat between 5,000 and 8,000 years ago, during the Early and Middle Archaic period in the Americas. The peat at the Florida sites is loosely consolidated and much wetter than in European bogs. As a result, the skeletons are well preserved, but skin and most internal organs have not been preserved. An exception is that preserved brains have been found in nearly 100 skulls at Windover Archaeological Site and in one of several burials at Little Salt Spring. Textiles were also preserved with some of the burials, the oldest known textiles in Florida. A 7,000-year-old presumed peat pond burial site, the Manasota Key Offshore archaeological site, has been found under of water near Sarasota. Archaeologists believe that early Archaic Native Americans buried the bodies in a freshwater pond when the sea level was much lower. The peat in the ponds helped preserve the skeletons.

==Discovery and archaeological investigation==
Ever since the Iron Age, humans have used the bogs to harvest peat, a common fuel source. On various occasions throughout history, peat diggers have come across bog bodies. Records of such finds go back as far as the 17th century, and in 1640 a bog body was discovered at Schalkholz Fen in Holstein, Germany. This was possibly the first-ever such discovery recorded. The first more fully documented account of the discovery of a bog body was in 1780 at a peat bog on Drumkeragh Mountain in County Down, Ireland; it was published by Elizabeth Rawdon, Countess of Moira, the wife of the local landowner. Such reports continued into the 18th century: for instance, a body was reportedly found on the Danish island of Fyn in 1773, whilst the Kibbelgaarn body was discovered in the Netherlands in 1791. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, when such bodies were discovered, they were often removed from the bogs and given a Christian burial on consecrated church grounds in keeping with the religious beliefs of the community who found them, who often assumed that they were relatively modern.

With the rise of antiquarianism in the 19th century, some people began to speculate that many of the bog bodies were not recent murder victims but were ancient in origin. In 1843, at Corselitze on Falster in Denmark, a bog body unusually buried with ornaments (seven glass beads and a bronze pin) was unearthed and subsequently given a Christian burial. By order of the Crown Prince Frederick, who was an antiquarian, the body was dug up again and sent to the National Museum of Denmark. According to the archaeologist P.V. Glob, it was &quot;he, more than anyone else, [who] helped to arouse the wide interest in Danish antiquities&quot; such as the bog bodies.

After the Haraldskær Woman was unearthed in Denmark, she was exhibited as having been the legendary Queen Gunhild of the Early Mediaeval period. This view was disputed by the archaeologist J. J. A. Worsaae, who argued that the body was Iron Age in origin, like most bog bodies, and predated any historical persons by at least 500 years. The first bog body that was photographed was the Iron Age Rendswühren Man, discovered in 1871, at the Heidmoor Fen, near Kiel in Germany. His body was subsequently smoked as an early attempt at conservation and put on display in a museum. With the rise of modern archaeology in the early 20th century, archaeologists began to excavate and investigate bog bodies more carefully and thoroughly.

===Archaeological techniques===

Until the mid-20th century, it was not readily apparent at the time of discovery whether a body had been buried in a bog for years, decades, or centuries. However, modern forensic and medical technologies (such as radiocarbon dating) have been developed that allow researchers to more closely determine the age of the burial, the person&#x27;s age at death, and other details. Scientists have been able to study the skin of the bog bodies, reconstruct their appearance and even determine what their last meal was from their stomach contents since peat marsh preserves soft internal tissue. Radiocarbon dating is also common as it accurately gives the date of the find, most usually from the Iron Age. For example, Tollund man of Denmark, whose remains were recovered in 1950, has undergone radiocarbon analyses that place his death date to around the 3rd or 4th century.

More modern analyses using stable isotope measurements have allowed scientists to study bone collagen collected from Tollund Man to determine his diet as being terrestrial-based. Their teeth also indicate their age at death and what type of food they ate throughout their lifetime. Dental caries, which are cavities within teeth, can direct archaeologist toward a person&#x27;s diet prior to their death. Unlike erosion that the teeth may undergo due to decay, dental caries are typically sharp and well-defined cavities that have a larger diameter than erosion that occurs after death. Significant rates of dental caries point to diets that are rich in carbohydrates and can lead archaeologists to differentiate between plant-based diets and protein-based diets (animal protein is non-cariogenic). Dental enamel defects known as hypoplasias can also be seen in the analysis of teeth and can point towards malnutrition as well as diseases. Ground-penetrating radar can be used in archaeological investigation to map features beneath the ground to reconstruct 3D visualizations. For bog bodies, ground-penetrating radar can be used to detect bodies and artefacts beneath the bog surface before cutting into the peat.

Forensic facial reconstruction is one technique used in studying the bog bodies. Originally designed for identifying modern faces in crime investigations, this technique is a way of working out the facial features of a person by the shape of their skull. The face of one bog body, Yde Girl, was reconstructed in 1992 by forensic pathologist Richard Neave of Manchester University using CT scans of her head. Yde Girl and her modern reconstruction are displayed at the Drents Museum in Assen. Such reconstructions have also been made of the heads of Lindow Man (British Museum, London, United Kingdom), Grauballe Man, Girl of the Uchter Moor, Clonycavan Man, Roter Franz and Windeby I.

==Notable bog bodies==

Hundreds of bog bodies have been recovered and studied.
The bodies have been most commonly found in the Northern European countries of Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Great Britain, and Ireland. In 1965, the German scientist Alfred Dieck catalogued more than 1,850 bog bodies, but later scholarship revealed that much of Dieck&#x27;s work was erroneous, and the exact number of discovered bodies is unknown.

Several bog bodies are notable for the high quality of their preservation and the substantial research by archaeologists and forensic scientists.
A more complete list is given in the article List of bog bodies.

<text>Saudia (), formerly known as Saudi Arabian Airlines (), is the flag carrier of Saudi Arabia based in Jeddah. The airline&#x27;s main hubs are the King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah and the King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh, the latter of which it plans to move out of by 2030.

Saudia operates scheduled domestic and international flights to over 100 destinations in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Europe and North America. Charter flights are operated mostly during the Ramadan and the Hajj seasons. It has been part of the SkyTeam airline alliance since 2012, making it the first carrier from the Persian Gulf region to join a major airline alliance. Saudia is a founding member of the Arab Air Carriers&#x27; Organization.

==History==
===Early years===

When U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt presented a Douglas DC-3 as a gift to King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud in 1945, the event marked the kingdom&#x27;s gradual development of civil aviation. The nation&#x27;s flag carrier, Saudia, was founded as Saudi Arabian Airlines in September 1945 as a fully owned government agency under the control of the Ministry of Defense, with Trans World Airlines (TWA) running the airline under a management contract.

The now-demolished Al-Kandara Airport, close to Jeddah, was the flag carrier&#x27;s main base. Among the airline&#x27;s early operations was a special flight from Lydda (Lod) in Palestine (today in Israel, site of Ben-Gurion International Airport), a British Mandate at that time, to carry Hajj pilgrims to Jeddah. The airline used five DC-3 aircraft to launch scheduled operations on the Jeddah-Riyadh-Hofuf-Dhahran route in March 1947. Its first international service was between Jeddah and Cairo. Service to Beirut, Karachi and Damascus followed in early 1948. The first of five Bristol 170s was received the following year. These aircraft offered the airline the flexibility of carrying both passengers and cargo.

In 1962, the airline took delivery of two Boeing 720s, becoming the fourth Middle Eastern airline to fly jet aircraft after Middle East Airlines and Cyprus Airways with the de Havilland Comet in 1960 and El Al with the Boeing 707 in 1961. On 19 February 1963, the airline became a registered company, with King Faisal of Saudi Arabia signing the papers that declared Saudia a fully independent company. DC-6s and Boeing 707s were later bought, and the airline joined the AACO, the Arab Air Carriers&#x27; Organization. Services were started to Frankfurt, Geneva, Khartoum, London, Mumbai, Rabat, Sharjah, Tehran, Tripoli, and Tunis.

In the 1970s, a new livery was introduced. It comprised a white fuselage with green and blue stripes and a green tailfin. The carrier&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Saudia&quot; on 1 April 1972. Boeing 737s and Fokker F-28s were bought, with the 737s replacing the Douglas DC-9. The airline operated its first Boeing 747 service in 1977 when three jumbo jets were leased from Middle East Airlines and deployed in the London sector. The first all-cargo flights between Saudi Arabia and Europe were started, and Lockheed L-1011s and Fairchild FH-27s were introduced. New services, including the &quot;Arabian Express&quot; &#x27;no reservation shuttle flights&#x27; between Jeddah and Riyadh. The Special Flight Services (SFS) was set up as a special unit of Saudia and operates special flights for the royal family and government agencies. Service was also started to Kano, Muscat, Paris, Rome, and Stockholm. The Pan Am/Saudia joint service between Dhahran and New York City began in 1979.

In the 1980s, services such as Saudia Catering began. Flights were started to Amsterdam, Athens, Baghdad, Bangkok, Brussels, Colombo, Dakar, Delhi, Dhaka, Islamabad, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Lahore, Madrid, Manila, Mogadishu, Nairobi, New York City, Nice, Seoul, Singapore, and Taipei. &quot;Horizon Class&quot;, a business class service, was established to offer enhanced service. Cargo hubs were built in Brussels and Taipei. Airbus A300s, Boeing 747s, and Cessna Citations were also added to the fleet, the Citations for the SFS service. On 1 July 1982, the first nonstop service from Jeddah to New York City was initiated with Boeing 747SP aircraft. This was followed by a Riyadh-New York route. In 1989, services to Larnaca and Addis Ababa began.

In the 1990s, services to Orlando, Chennai, Asmara, Washington, D.C., Johannesburg, Alexandria, Milan, Málaga (seasonal), and Sana&#x27;a (resumption) were introduced. Boeing 777s, MD-90s, and MD-11s were introduced. New female flight attendant uniforms designed by Adnan Akbar were introduced. A new corporate identity was launched on 16 July 1996, featuring a sand colored fuselage with contrasting dark blue tailfin, the center of which featured a stylized representation of the House of Saud crest. The Saudia name was dropped in the identity revamp, with the full Saudi Arabian Airlines name used.

===Development (2000s–2020s)===
On 8 October 2000, Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, the Saudi Minister of Defense and Aviation, signed a contract to conduct studies for the privatization of Saudi Arabian Airlines. In preparation for this, the airline was restructured to allow non-core units—including Saudia catering, ground handling services and maintenance as well as the Prince Sultan Aviation Academy in Jeddah—to be transformed into commercial units and profit centers. In April 2005, the Saudi government indicated that the airline may also lose its monopoly on domestic services.

In 2006, Saudia began the process of dividing itself into Strategic Business Units (SBU); the catering unit was the first to be privatized. In August 2007, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Council of Ministers approved the conversion of strategic units into companies. It is planned that ground services, technical services, air cargo and the Prince Sultan Aviation Academy, medical division, as well as the catering unit, will become subsidiaries of a holding company.

The airline rebranded to its former brand name &quot;Saudia&quot; (used from 1972 to 1996) on 29 May 2012, dropping the Saudi Arabian Airlines branding entirely; the name was changed to celebrate the company&#x27;s entry into the SkyTeam airline alliance on that day, and it was part of a larger rebranding initiative.

Saudia received 64 new aircraft by the end of 2012 (six from Boeing and 58 from Airbus). Another eight Boeing 787-9 aircraft started to join the fleet in 2015.

In April 2016, Saudia announced the creation of a low-cost subsidiary named Flyadeal. The airline was launched as part of Saudia Group&#x27;s SV 2020 Transformation Strategy, which intends to transform the group&#x27;s units into world-class organisations by 2020. Flyadeal, which serves domestic and regional destinations, began operating in mid 2017.

===Continued growth and new brand identity (2020s–present)===
In April 2021, Saudia announced that on 19 April, it will try the mobile app developed by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) that helps passengers manage their travel information and documents digitally.

In December 2021, Saudia was in talks with the two major aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing in purchasing new wide-body aircraft, the airline will decide in early 2022 whether it will order the Airbus A350 or the Boeing 777X, or it might purchase more Boeing 787s instead. The airline also chose the CFM International LEAP engine to power its Airbus A321neos which are expected to be delivered in 2024. The airline plans to have 250 planes in its fleet by 2030.

In April 2022, services began to Seoul, Beijing, Batumi, Mykonos, Barcelona, Málaga, Bangkok, Chicago, Moscow, Entebbe and Kyiv. Services to Kyiv are currently not operating due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. In June 2022, they resumed services to Zürich. In July 2022, Saudia signed a contract with the Air Connectivity Programme to launch four new destinations to Zürich, Barcelona, Tunis and Kuala Lumpur.

In March 2023, Saudia ordered 39 Boeing 787s split between the -9 and -10 variants, with options for a further ten aircraft.

In September 2023, Saudia announced a brand and livery rebrand back to the 1970s design and logo. It also introduced a new travel AI assistant called &quot;SAUDIA&quot;, using Open AI&#x27;s GPT-4.

In January 2025, Saudia announced that the airline will be relocating its London to Neom route from Heathrow to Gatwick. The Heathrow route utilized larger Boeing 787-9 aircraft whereas Gatwick enables the airline to introduce smaller Airbus A320 aircraft, thus aligning capacity with demand and optimizing the airline&#x27;s operational efficiency.

== Awards ==
Saudia was named the World&#x27;s Most Improved Airline for 2017 and 2020 by SkyTrax.

== Sponsorships ==
Saudia was the main sponsor of the Williams Formula One team from 1977 to 1984. During this period Williams won the Constructors&#x27; Championship twice ( and ), and two Williams drivers won the Drivers&#x27; Championship: Alan Jones in and Keke Rosberg in .

Saudia was the main sponsor of the 2018 and 2019 Diriyah ePrix. They are the official airline of Formula E, with one of their planes, a Boeing 777-300ER, painted in a special livery featuring an eagle head with the Spark SRT05e Gen2 car behind it.

In November 2022, Newcastle United announced Saudia as the club’s official tour airline partner.

==Incidents and accidents==
* On 25 September 1959, a Saudia Douglas DC-4/C-54A-5-DO (registration HZ-AAF), performed a belly landing shortly after take-off from the old Jeddah Airport. The cause of the accident was gust locks not deactivated by the mechanic, followed by a stall. All 67 passengers and five crew members survived.
* On 9 February 1968, a Douglas C-47 (reg. HZ-AAE) was damaged beyond economic repair at an unknown location.
* On 10 November 1970, a Douglas DC-3 on a flight from Amman Civil Airport, Jordan to King Khalid International Airport, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia was hijacked and diverted to Damascus Airport, Syria.
* On 11 July 1972, a Douglas C-47B (reg. HZ-AAK) was damaged beyond economic repair in an accident at Tabuk Airport.
* On 2 January 1976, Saudia Flight 5130, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30CF, leased from ONA undershot the runway at Istanbul, Turkey, crash landed, tearing off the #1 engine and causing the left wing to catch fire. All passengers and crew evacuated safely. The aircraft was written off.

* On 19 August 1980, Saudia Flight 163, a Lockheed L-1011-200 TriStar (HZ-AHK), operating Karachi-Riyadh-Jeddah, was completely destroyed by fire at Riyadh airport with the loss of all 301 people on board due to delays in evacuating the aircraft. This was the deadliest accident experienced by Saudia until 312 were killed in the loss of Flight 763 over 16 years later.
* On 22 December 1980, Saudia Flight 162, a Lockheed L-1011-200 TriStar, operating Dhahran to Karachi, experienced an explosive decompression, penetrating the passenger cabin. The hole sucked out two passengers and depressurized the cabin.
* On 5 April 1984, a Saudia Lockheed L-1011 TriStar on final approach to Damascus from Jeddah was hijacked by a Syrian national. The hijacker demanded to be taken to Istanbul, Turkey but changed his mind and requested to go to Stockholm, Sweden. After landing in Istanbul to refuel, the hijacker was arrested after the pilot pushed him out of the emergency exit.
* On 12 November 1996, a Saudia Boeing 747-100B (HZ-AIH), operating flight 763, was involved in the 1996 Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision. The aircraft was on its way from New Delhi, India, to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia when a Kazakhstan Airlines Ilyushin Il-76 (UN-76435) collided with it over the village of Charkhi Dadri, some miles west of New Delhi. Flight 763 was carrying 312 people, all of whom, along with 37 more on the Kazakh aircraft, died, for a total of 349 fatalities. The loss of Flight 763 alone remains Saudia&#x27;s worst accident in terms of fatalities. The accident overall also remains the world&#x27;s deadliest mid-air collision.
* On 6 September 1997, A Boeing 737-200 operating as Saudia Flight 1861 (reg. HZ-AGM) from Najran was accelerating on its takeoff roll when the No. 2 engine spooled up without any pilot input, the captain attempted to abort the landing but the engine continued to increase in power. The plane veered to the left of the runway, causing the main landing gears to collapse and tearing the right engine off the wing. It skidded for a few meters before stopping on the sand, a fire broke out but all 85 occupants managed to escape.
* On 14 October 2000, Saudia Flight 115, flying from Jeddah to London was hijacked en route by two men who claimed they were armed with explosives. The hijackers commandeered the Boeing 777-200ER (HZ-AKH) to Baghdad, Iraq, where all 90 passengers and 15 crew members were safely released. The two hijackers, identified as Lieutenant Faisal Naji Hamoud Al-Bilawi and First Lieutenant Ayesh Ali Hussein Al-Fareedi, both Saudi citizens, were arrested and later extradited to Saudi Arabia in 2003.
* On 23 August 2001, at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Malaysia, a Boeing 747-300 (reg. HZ-AIO) suffered nose damage as it entered a monsoon drainage ditch while it was being taxied by maintenance staff from the hangar to the gate before a return flight to Saudi Arabia. None of the six crew members on board at the time were injured, but the aircraft was written off.
* On 8 September 2005, a Boeing 747 travelling from Colombo to Jeddah, carrying mostly Sri Lankan nationals to take up employment in the Kingdom, received a false alarm claiming that a bomb had been planted on board. The aircraft returned to Colombo. During the evacuation, there was a passenger stampede in the wake of which one Sri Lankan woman died, 62 were injured, and 17 were hospitalized. The aircraft had taken on a load of 420 passengers in Colombo. According to the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka, the probable cause was a &quot;Breakdown of timely and effective communication amongst Aerodrome Controller and Ground Handling (SriLankan Airlines) personnel had prevented a timely dispatch of the stepladders to the aircraft to deplane the passengers on time, which resulted in the Pilot-In-Command to order an emergency evacuation of the passengers through slides after being alarmed by the bomb threat.&quot;
* On 25 May 2008, an Air Atlanta Icelandic aircraft operating for Saudia as Flight 810 (TF-ARS) from Prince Mohammad Bin Abdulaziz Airport, Madinah made an unscheduled landing at Zia International Airport (now Shahjalal International Airport), Dhaka. During the roll, the tower controller reported that he saw a fire on the right-hand wing. Upon vacating the runway, the crew received a fire indication for engine number three. The fire extinguisher was activated and all engines were shut down. The aircraft, a Boeing 747-357, which was damaged beyond repair, was successfully evacuated. Only minor injuries were incurred. Investigations revealed a fuel leak where the fuel enters the front spar for engine number three.
* On 5 January 2014, a leased Boeing 767-300ER operating under Saudia was forced to make an emergency landing at Prince Mohammad bin Abdulaziz Airport in Medina after the right landing gear failed to deploy. Fourteen passengers were minorly injured and three passengers were seriously injured from the evacuation via the emergency slides. The aircraft was substantially damaged and repaired.
* On 5 August 2014, a Boeing 747-400 (reg. HZ-AIX) operating as flight 871 from Manila to Riyadh veered off runway 24 of Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila while positioning for takeoff. No one on the plane or ground was injured.
* On 11 November 2017, a MyCargo Airlines Boeing 747-400 freighter operated by Saudia Cargo (reg. TC-ACR) as flight SV916 from Maastricht (EHBK) to Jeddah (OEJN) veered off to the right of the runway during the takeoff roll in after a loss of thrust on the #4 engine caused by a compressor stall. The pilots did not immediately retard the thrust levers, and more standard procedures weren&#x27;t followed as the plane swerved due to &#x27;startle effect&#x27;. The aircraft was repaired soon after.
* On 21 May 2018, an Onur Air-leased Airbus A330-200 registered as TC-OCH, operating as Flight 3818 from Medina to Dhaka, was diverted to Jeddah after suffering a malfunction with the nose landing gear. It was forced to make an emergency landing with its nose gear retracted. No injuries were reported.
* On 20 June 2022, a Boeing 777-368 operating as Flight 862 from Riyadh veered off and got stuck at a taxiway in Manila after landing. All 420 people on board were unharmed.
* On 15 April 2023, an Airbus A330-343 operating as Flight 458 was destroyed while preparing to take off in Khartoum Airport during the 2023 Sudan clashes. The aircraft, registered as HZ-AQ30, was hit by a tracer bullet, causing its hull to burn and its tail section to collapse. Despite the damage, all occupants onboard managed to escape without any injuries and were evacuated to the Saudi Embassy in Khartoum. Another Saudi plane was a few hundred kilometres away from airport and it did not land. It did a U-turn in order to avoid being shot down.
* On 11 July 2024, an Airbus A330-343, registered HZ-AQ28, operating as Flight 792 from Riyadh International Airport to Peshawar International Airport, caught fire after a minor issue caused the landing gear to catch fire.

<text>Vladimir Leonidovitch Levin () is a Russian individual famed for his involvement in a hacking attempt to fraudulently transfer $10.7 million ($ million in ) via Citibank&#x27;s computers.

== The commonly known story ==

At the time, the mass media claimed he was a mathematician and had a degree in biochemistry from Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology.

According to the coverage, in 1994 Levin accessed the accounts of several large corporate customers of Citibank via their dial-up wire transfer service (Financial Institutions Citibank Cash Manager) and transferred funds to accounts set up by accomplices in Finland, the United States, the Netherlands, Germany and Israel.

Three of his accomplices were arrested attempting to withdraw funds in Tel Aviv, Rotterdam and San Francisco. Interrogation of his accomplices directed investigations to Levin, who was then working as a computer programmer for St. Petersburg-based computer company AO Saturn. However, Russia&#x27;s Constitution prohibits the extradition of its citizens to foreign countries.

In March 1995, Levin was lured to London and apprehended at London&#x27;s Stansted Airport by Scotland Yard officers when making an interconnecting flight from Moscow. Levin&#x27;s lawyers fought against extradition to the U.S., but their appeal was rejected by the House of Lords in June 1997.

Levin was delivered into U.S. custody in September 1997 and was tried in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In his plea agreement, he admitted to only one count of conspiracy to defraud and to stealing US$3.7 million. In February 1998, he was convicted and sentenced to three years in jail, and ordered to make a restitution of US$240,015. Citibank claimed that all but US$400,000 of the stolen US$10.7 million had been recovered.

After the compromise of their system, Citibank updated their systems to use Dynamic Encryption Card, a physical authentication token. However, it was not revealed how Levin had gained access to the relevant account access details. Following his arrest in 1995, anonymous members of hacking groups based in St. Petersburg claimed that Levin did not have the technical abilities to break into Citibank&#x27;s systems, that they had cultivated access to systems deep within the bank&#x27;s network, and that these access details had been sold to Levin for $100.

== The revelation a decade later ==

In 2005, an alleged member of the former St. Petersburg hacker group, claiming to be one of the original Citibank penetrators, published a memorandum under the name ArkanoiD on the popular Provider.net.ru website dedicated to the telecom market. According to him, Levin was not actually a scientist (mathematician, biologist, or the like) but a kind of ordinary system administrator who managed to get hands on the ready data about how to penetrate Citibank machines and then exploit them.

ArkanoiD emphasized that all the communications were carried over X.25 network, and the Internet was not involved. ArkanoiD&#x27;s group in 1994 found out Citibank systems were unprotected, and they spent several weeks examining the structure of the bank&#x27;s USA-based networks remotely. Members of the group played around with systems&#x27; tools (e.g. were installing and running games) and were unnoticed by the bank&#x27;s staff. Penetrators did not plan to conduct a robbery for their personal safety and stopped their activities at some point. One of them later handed over the crucial access data to Levin (reportedly for the stated $100).

<text>The Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra (Entering the Bodhisattva Conduct) or Bodhicaryāvatāra (Entering the Bodhi Way; Tibetan: བྱང་ཆུབ་སེམས་དཔའི་སྤྱོད་པ་ལ་འཇུག་པ་ &quot;byang chub sems dpa&#x27;i spyod pa la &#x27;jug pa;&quot; Chinese: 入菩薩行論), is a Mahāyāna Buddhist text written c. 700 CE in Sanskrit verse by Shantideva (Śāntideva), a Buddhist monk at Nālandā University in India which is also where it was composed.

==Structure==
&quot;Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra&quot; has ten chapters dedicated to the development of bodhicitta (the mind of enlightenment) through the practice of the six perfections (&quot;Skt.&quot; Pāramitās). The text begins with a chapter describing the benefits of the wish to reach enlightenment. The sixth chapter, on the perfection of patient endurance (&quot;Skt.&quot; ), strongly criticizes anger and has been the subject of recent commentaries by Robert Thurman and the fourteenth Dalai Lama. Tibetan scholars consider the ninth chapter, &quot;Wisdom&quot;, to be one of the most succinct expositions of the Madhyamaka view. The tenth chapter is used as one of the most popular Mahāyāna prayers.

==Chapter summary==
# The benefits of bodhicitta (the wish to reach full enlightenment for others)
# Purifying bad deeds
# Adopting the spirit of enlightenment
# Using conscientiousness
# Guarding awareness
# The practice of patience
# The practice of joyous effort
# The practice of meditative concentration
# The perfection of wisdom
# Dedication

==Exegetical discourse and commentary==
Many Tibetan scholars, such as Jamgön Ju Mipham Gyatso, have written commentaries on this text.

<text>José Martí International Airport , sometimes known by its former name Rancho Boyeros Airport (&quot;Aeropuerto de Rancho Boyeros&quot;), (Spanish: &quot;Aeropuerto Internacional José Martí&quot;) is an international airport located in the municipality of Boyeros, southwest of the centre of Havana, Cuba, and is a hub for Cubana de Aviación and Aerogaviota, and former Latin American hub for the Soviet (later Russian) airline Aeroflot. It is Cuba&#x27;s main international airport, and serves several million passengers each year. The facility is operated by Empresa Cubana de Aeropuertos y Servicios Aeronáuticos (ECASA).

The airport lies in the municipality of Boyeros and connects Havana with the rest of the Caribbean, North, Central and South America, as well as Europe. It is named in memory of patriot and poet José Martí.

Private Cuban citizens are not allowed to own aircraft; all aircraft in Cuba belong to state-owned airlines or the military. Only government- and foreign-owned aircraft are allowed to use the facilities. , Copa Airlines was the foreign airline with most flights to the airport, operating 34 flights a week (roughly five daily flights) from Panama City, Panama, and Bogotá, Colombia.

==History==


===Foundation and early years===
The current José Martí Airport in 1930 replaced the &quot;Columbia Airfield&quot;, which was the first airport to serve Havana. The original name of the airport, &quot;Rancho Boyeros&quot;, meaning the &quot;(Bull) Drover Ranch&quot;, was in reference to the name of the plains where the airport was being built. It was known as the &quot;Rancho Boyeros&quot; because in colonial times a local family had built a thatched hut and provided meals and an inn to the weary drovers that brought agricultural products to the capital from Batabanó and Vuelta Abajo. To give a progressive environment to the airport, the old ranch homes were transformed into a small town that would serve as an industrial, livestock, agriculture and commercial centre, rising comfortable homes, an industrial technical school, a paint factory and other facilities. The town today is known as the Boyeros Municipality.

The construction of José Martí Airport, formerly &quot;Rancho Boyeros Airport&quot;, was authorized in March 1929 by General Order No. 223. On February 24, 1930, the airport opened, replacing the former Ciudad Libertad Airport. On October 30 of the same year, the first flight by Cubana de Aviación (formerly &quot;Compañía Nacional Cubana de Aviación Curtiss&quot;) from Havana to Santiago de Cuba carried the mail on a Ford Trimotor with stops in Santa Clara, Morón and Camagüey. Flights to Madrid started in 1936 with a Lockheed Sirius named &quot;September 4&quot;, commanded by Capt. Antonio Menéndez Pélaez. She was flown via Venezuela, Natal, Brazil, and Dakar, Senegal.

By January 1943 the airport had its first control tower, the first in the country. vIn 1945, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) was formed in Havana. Cubana&#x27;s first international flight out of the airport was a Douglas DC-3 to Miami on May 15 of the same year. The first transatlantic flight from any Latin American country to Europe took place in 1946 from Havana to Madrid on a Douglas DC-4, operated by Aerovias Cubanas Internacionales (Cunnair), founded by Cuban pioneer Reinaldo Ramirez Rosell. On April 2, 1950 the airport received a second route to Europe with flights to Rome on a Cubana de Aviación DC-4. The first night flight landed at the airport from Santiago de Cuba with a Douglas DC-3 in 1951. The first route to Mexico City was inaugurated in 1953 by Cubana, utilizing a Lockheed Constellation.

===Development in the 1950s===
Since the 1950s, Havana saw a sharp increase in international air traffic. Regarding flights to the United States, Pan American World Airways had 4–8 daily flights from Havana to Miami. It connected Havana with Mérida and San Salvador, with DC-4 and DC-6. It also had flights to the south, including Jamaica, Venezuela and other South American countries. Delta Air Lines connected Havana with New Orleans and Chicago and to the south with Montego Bay, Jamaica and Caracas. It also flew from Havana to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. It flew with Convair 440 and DC-7. Mackey Airlines inaugurated its passenger service between Fort Lauderdale and Havana, with DC-4. National Airlines in 1958 flew daily from New York City, Tampa, and Miami, with DC-6, DC-7 and Convair 340/440. Braniff International Airways DC-6s connected Havana to the north with Houston, and to the south with Panama and other South American countries, such as Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, Argentina and others.

There was also a vast amount of flights within Latin America. Aerolíneas Argentinas connected Buenos Aires to Havana via Rio de Janeiro, Trinidad, and New York City, with DC-6s. Aeropostal Venezolana S.A. flew Miami-Havana-Caracas with Super Constellations. LACSA, &quot;Líneas Aéreas Costarricenses&quot;, connected Havana with San José and other cities in Central America, such as Guatemala City, mainly with Convair 340. Mexicana de Aviación flew between Havana, Mérida and Mexico City, 4 times weekly.

Additionally, there were already few services to Europe when Iberia vied with Cubana in the route to Madrid, with Super Constellations. KLM flew between Havana-Montreal-Europe with DC-7 and the route Miami-Havana-Curaçao, with DC-6 and DC-7. 

Cubana de Aviación in 1958 flew five daily Viscount 818s to Miami, and Bristol Britannia 318s to Madrid, Mexico City, and New York.

===Embargoes since the 1960s===
In 1961, diplomatic relations with the United States deteriorated substantially and with the United States embargo against Cuba, airlines from the United States were not permitted to operate regular scheduled flights to the airport. That year, two days prior to the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion organized by the CIA with the participation of Cuban exiles, Douglas A-26 Invader aircraft from Brigade 2506 bombarded José Martí Airport and Antonio Maceo Airport in Santiago de Cuba.

Because of Cuba&#x27;s relationship with the Soviet Union, the airport during the 1970s and 1980s enjoyed the presence of many Eastern Bloc airline companies, such as Aeroflot, Czechoslovak Airlines, Interflug, and LOT Polish Airlines. In 1977 an Aeroflot Ilyushin Il-62 operating a scheduled flight from Moscow to Havana via Frankfurt and Lisbon crashed after takeoff from Lisbon, killing 68 of the 70 on board and one person on the ground. 

In 1988, Terminal 2 was constructed in anticipation of future charter flights to the United States. In the 1990s the special charter flights were approved by the US government, to operate from Miami for Cuban citizens living in the United States that have close relatives in Cuba. Today, various airlines operate non-stop scheduled charter service between Havana and Miami. On December 31, 1997 a Concorde landed in Cuba for the first time, landing at José Martí Airport. The London-Paris-Barbados-Havana Air France flight was received at the airport by Fidel Castro, who boarded the aircraft and greeted the crew and passengers. On April 26 the following year, the new International Terminal 3 was inaugurated by Canada&#x27;s Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and Cuba&#x27;s President Fidel Castro.

===Development in the 2000s===
In 2002 &quot;Air Freight Logistics Enterprise&quot; (ELCA S.A.) opened José Martí&#x27;s first freight terminal known as the &quot;Aerovaradero Freight Terminal&quot;. The terminal has a capacity, of space in two refrigeration and freezing chambers, with humidity and gas controls.

In 2007, three young recruits who deserted from the Cuban Army tried to hijack a commercial passenger aircraft aiming to defect to the United States. At Terminal 1, the would-be hijackers killed one of the hostages, a lieutenant colonel. Terminal 2 was remodeled and expanded in 2010.

Special charter service to the United States were allowed from the 1990s, but were required to be operated by travel companies licensed by the U.S. government, largely from Florida. In March 2015, Sun Country Airlines started operating regularly scheduled charter flights from New York during the Cuban Thaw. Delta resumed its flights to New Orleans in March 2015, after not flying the route for over 50 years. Regularly scheduled commercial service to and from the United States began again in the fall of 2016, with such airlines as American, Delta, JetBlue and, after January 2017, Alaska, flying to Havana. However, several airlines had dropped, if not cut back, flights to Cuba by late 2017 due in part to President Trump&#x27;s decision to reimpose stricter travel regulations, therefore partially ending the Cuban Thaw. Several other reasons that the airlines ended the flights were because of weaker-than-expected demand and a paucity of tourist infrastructure.

In February 2016, a VIP room at the airport was used as the location for the historic meeting of Pope Francis and Patriarch Kirill.

In March 2020, Cuba announced that it was closing its borders because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Only humanitarian flights were then permitted. On November 10, 2020, it was announced that the airport would re-open to commercial flights on November 15. Some airlines started operations again, but not all those which had flown previously. In January 2021, the Cuban authorities placed restrictions on the number of flights from a number of countries, and halted flights from a few. Separately, Canadian airlines stopped flying to Caribbean destinations, including Cuba.

==Terminals==
There are currently three passenger terminals in general use at the airport. Terminal 1 is used primarily for domestic flights. Terminal 2 opened in 1988, primarily for charter flights to the United States. Ten years later on April 27, 1998, the International Terminal 3 opened, offering many modern facilities and jetways that the former international Terminal 1 did not provide. For transfer between terminals, bus services are offered.

===Terminal 1===
Domestic Terminal 1 was the main international and domestic terminal building in the airport prior to the opening of Terminals 2 and 3. It is located on the east side of Runway 6, and is now used primarily for domestic flights.

===Terminal 2===
Terminal 2 handles some long-distance international flights, such as to Zürich, Frankfurt, and Helsinki, along with a few Caribbean flights, such as to Aruba, Trinidad and Tobago, and most scheduled charter flights to and from Miami, Tampa, Ft. Lauderdale, and New York City. The scheduled charter flights to the United States are operated by Gulfstream Air Charters, ABC Charters, Marazul Charters, CTS Charters, and C &amp; T Charters. The terminal is located on the north side roughly from Terminal 3, and is just in front of the threshold of runway 24. It was constructed in 1988 when the first charter flights after the revolution were opened from Miami. There are bars, bookshops, newsagents, a restaurant, and car rentals.

===Terminal 3===
International Terminal 3 is the main international terminal and was designed by Mario Girona, it opened in 1998. It is the largest and most modern of all terminals. Ticketing and departures are located on the upper level; arrivals and baggage carousels are located on the lower level. There are several car rentals located in the arrivals area.

<text>Drag kings have historically been mostly female performance artists who dress in masculine drag and personify male gender stereotypes as part of an individual or group routine. As documented in the 2003 &quot;Journal of Homosexuality,&quot; in more recent years the world of drag kings has broadened to include performers of all gender expressions. A typical drag show may incorporate dancing, acting, stand-up comedy and singing, either live or lip-synching to pre-recorded tracks. Drag kings often perform as exaggeratedly macho male characters, portray characters such as construction workers and rappers, or impersonate male celebrities like Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson and Tim McGraw. Drag kings may also perform as personas that do not clearly align with the gender binary. Drag personas that combine both stereotypically masculine and feminine traits are common in modern drag king shows.

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, several drag kings became British music hall stars and British pantomime has preserved the tradition of women performing in male roles. Starting in the mid-1990s, drag kings began to gain some of the fame and attention that drag queens have known.

==History and terminology==

While the term &quot;drag king&quot; was first cited in print in 1972, there is a longer history of female performers dressing in male attire. In China, the practice of &quot;female men [characters]&quot; (&quot;kunsheng&quot;; see also &quot;sheng&quot; roles), in which women portrayed men in stage performances, were first documented during the middle Tang dynasty (617–908 CE). This continued through to the early Qing dynasty, when the Qianlong Emperor banned actresses from performing in 1722. It was revived in the late 19th and 20th centuries as the ban on actresses was loosened.

In theatre and opera, there was a tradition of breeches roles and en travesti. Actress and playwright Susanna Centlivre appeared in breeches roles around 1700. The first popular male impersonator in U.S. theatre was Annie Hindle, who started performing in New York in 1867. In 1886, she married her dresser, Annie Ryan.

British music hall performer Vesta Tilley was active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a male impersonator. Other male impersonators on the British stage were Ella Shields and Hetty King. American Vaudeville entertainer Florence Hines was a pioneer male impersonator of the 1890s. Blues singer Gladys Bentley performed in male attire in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco from the 1920s through 1940s. 
Stormé DeLarverie performed in male drag as the MC, and sole female performer, of the drag troupe the Jewel Box Revue in the 1950s and 1960s. She is featured in the documentary &quot;Storme: The Lady of the Jewel Box&quot;. While the Stonewall riots of June 1969 were a series of spontaneous uprisings by many people, DeLarverie—who was the first to fight back against the police brutality—is believed to have provided the spark that ignited the riot.

Drag king culture in Australia flourished in lesbian bars from the 1990s and 2000s, but began to fade in the 2010s. In the UK, Drag Couple Adam All and Apple Derrieres set up Drag King Cabaret night &#x27;BOiBOX&#x27; in 2013 in Soho’s Candy Bar, a queer women’s venue that closed in 2014. While they were worried about finding enough performers to make their talent night work ‘Because there were barely any stages for us to perform [on], very few drag kings were actively pursuing gigs,’ BOIBOX inspired a new wave of budding kings and celebrated ten years in 2023 with a show at The Phoenix Arts Club in London&#x27;s Westend, with a surprise appearance from Landon Cider.

The term &quot;drag king&quot; is sometimes used in a broader sense, to include female-bodied people who dress in traditionally masculine clothing for other reasons. This usage includes women temporarily attempting to pass as men and women who wish to present themselves in a masculine gender role without identifying as a man. Diane Torr began leading Drag King Workshops in 1989 that offer women a lesson in passing as men. Torr was featured in the 2002 film on drag kings &quot;Venus Boyz&quot;.

Drag kings have historically been more marginalized by pop culture than drag queens, who began playing a larger role in mainstream pop culture from the late 20th century onwards. Drag kings have also historically been marginalized in academic LGBT studies. Recently, drag kings have started to play a slightly more visible role in the LGBT community. &quot;Sleek Magazine&quot; described this renaissance of drag king culture in a 2019 article titled &quot;What&#x27;s behind the drag king revolution?&quot;

The British drag king collective &#x27;Pecs&#x27;, a troupe made up entirely of women and non-binary people, was founded in 2013 and went on to perform at Soho Theatre and The Glory. In 2016, director Nicole Miyahara produced &quot;The Making of a King&quot;, a documentary film chronicling the lives of contemporary drag kings in Los Angeles. The first drag king to appear in a television show was New Zealand artist and comedian Hugo Grrrl who won the inaugural season of the New Zealand reality competition House of Drag in 2018. In 2019, American artist Landon Cider was the first drag king and cisgender woman to appear on a televised US drag competition when he won the third season of &quot;The Boulet Brothers&#x27; Dragula&quot;. In June 2022, three drag kings made a guest appearance in series one of &quot;Drag Race France&quot;, the first time the &quot;Drag Race&quot; franchise included drag kings.

==Drag community==
A British lesbian cabaret organization called Lesburlesque made it part of their mission to promote drag kings on the wider British cabaret circuit. Their founder Pixie Truffle gave an interview to the &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper in the United Kingdom on her desire for drag kings to close the gap with queens and with male stand-up comedians.

Similar to some drag queens who prefer to be seen as actors—like Justin Bond and Lypsinka—some drag kings prefer not to be pigeon-holed by the &quot;drag king&quot; label. &quot;I think when people assume that somebody is queer, or different, or trans, they always want to put something before their name,&quot; said Murray Hill in an interview. &quot;And that is what drag king has been. Why can not you just call me a comedian like Jerry Seinfeld is called a comedian?&quot;

In recent years, some drag king performers have adopted other terms to describe their own performance styles, particularly if they deviate from the more traditional forms of &quot;kinging&quot;. Common names including &quot;gender blurring&quot; acknowledge the merging of both male and female traits in the performances. Vancouver performer Rose Butch adopted the ambiguous label &quot;drag thing&quot;. Long-time performer Flare called the stage of drag king styles that emerged in Toronto&#x27;s scene in the mid-2010s as &quot;unicorn drag&quot;.

==Tools of gender illusion==
Face: One method drag kings use to modify their facial features is burning a wine cork and smudging it along the jaw to create the illusion of a beard or stubble. Kings may aim to deepen the colour of their eyebrows or create a fuller look with dark eyeliner or other makeup. Similarly some methods call for layering liquid eyeliner over the cork ash, or dark makeup, base. When trying to achieve a realistic look, drag kings may add crepe hair over the makeup using glue, thus completing the illusion of a full beard.

Look: Drag kings also make use of items such as socks and silicone prosthetics when packing, creating the illusion of a male appendage between the legs.

Stage Presence and Performance: An important part of gender illusion, this refers to the way a drag performer utilizes body language and takes up space on stage. Some kings will incorporate more aggressive choreography into their routines to emulate or expand on stereotypical masculine characteristics. Accessories, rhinestones and elaborate costumes contribute to a drag king&#x27;s performance.

===Breast binding===
Body shaping apparel, most commonly binders, kinesiology tape, and sports bras, are used to create the look of a flat chest. For hiding one&#x27;s breasts some use a method involving cutting a hole in the crotch of pantyhose for the head and making sleeves out the legs. Some drag kings use silicone chest plates that are pulled over the head to create a muscular, masculine chest shape and cover the breasts.

<text>John Adolphus Bernard Dahlgren (November 13, 1809 – July 12, 1870) was a United States Navy officer who founded his service&#x27;s Ordnance Department and launched significant advances in gunnery.

Dahlgren devised a smoothbore howitzer, adaptable for many sizes of craft and shore installations. He then introduced a cast-iron muzzle-loading cannon with vastly increased range and accuracy, known as the Dahlgren gun, that became the U.S. Navy&#x27;s standard armament.

In the Civil War, Dahlgren was made commander of the Washington Navy Yard, where he established the Bureau of Ordnance. In 1863, he took command of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron at the rank of rear admiral. He helped William Tecumseh Sherman secure Savannah, Georgia.

==Early life and education==

Dahlgren was born on November 13, 1809, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Bernhard Ulrik Dahlgren, a merchant and Swedish Consul in the city.

==Career==
Dahlgren joined the United States Navy in 1826 as a midshipman and was promoted to the coastal survey in 1834. By 1847, he was an ordnance officer, and at the Washington Navy Yard began to improve and systematize the procurement and supply system for weapons.

===Establishment of U.S. Navy&#x27;s Ordnance Department===
He was assigned to the Washington Navy Yard in 1847. While there, Dahlgren established the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Ordnance Department; became an ordnance expert; developed a percussion lock; and wrote several books, including &quot;The System of Boat Armaments in the United States Navy&quot;, &quot;Shells and Shell Guns&quot;, and &quot;Naval Percussion Locks and Primers&quot;. Under his command, the U.S. Navy established its own foundry to manufacture new equipment. Its first product was the boat howitzer, designed for use aboard ships and in landings.

====Dahlgren gun====
His most famous contribution was the Dahlgren gun, a cast-iron muzzle loading cannon. Dahlgren&#x27;s meticulous research using gauges to measure pressure differences in the cannon barrel as it was fired resulted in a design that utilized slower-detonating gunpowder and merged characteristics of John Ericsson&#x27;s experimental 12-inch &quot;Orator&quot; (and Robert Stockton&#x27;s tragically executed imitation, the &quot;Peacemaker&quot;) and the shell-guns adapted by French artillery officer Henri-Joseph Paixhans from their origination in the U.S. Army but named after him. Dahlgren wrote:

Paixhans had so far satisfied naval men of the power of shell guns as to obtain their admission on shipboard; but by unduly developing the explosive element, he had sacrificed accuracy and range. ... The difference between the system of Paixhans and my own was simply that Paixhans guns were strictly shell guns, and were not designed for shot, nor for great penetration or accuracy at long ranges. They were, therefore, auxiliary to, or associates of, the shot-guns. This made a mixed armament, was objectionable as such, and never was adopted to any extent in France ... My idea was, to have a gun that should generally throw shells far and accurately, with the capacity to fire solid shot when needed. Also to compose the whole battery entirely of such guns.

The U.S. Navy had equipped several ships with 8-inch Paixhans guns of 63 and 55 cwt. in 1845, and later a 10-inch shell gun of 86 cwt. In 1854, the six &quot;Merrimack&quot;-class steam frigates were equipped with 9-inch Dahlgren shell guns. By 1852, the Dahlgren gun had become the standard armament of the United States Navy.

The boat howitzer derived from a requirement realized during the Mexican–American War. During that war, naval landing parties were armed with various army ordnance, often too cumbersome for landing boats. Dahlgren first experimented with standard army-issue 12-pounder mountain howitzers before devising his own guns system. The boat howitzers came in four basic types: small, light (or medium), and heavy versions of the 12-pounder and a larger 24-pounder. All conformed to the same basic shape, straight gun tubes with no adorning bands or clefts. Elevation was made via a screw-threaded into the knob at the breech. Instead of traditional trunnions, the guns were attached to the carriage by a loop under the barrel. The Dahlgren system also included mounting carriages that facilitated various employments of the guns. A single-axle metal carriage was designed for shore use. A bed-type carriage was used on small boats, with a rail system to allow the gun to be trained fore, aft, and broadside. A similar mount was offered for shipboard use. The system of boat howitzers was used by the U.S. Navy well into the 1890s, with some examples used for ceremonial purposes into the 20th Century.

===American Civil War===

In 1861, Dahlgren&#x27;s superior at the Washington Navy Yard, Franklin Buchanan, resigned to join the Confederate navy. President Abraham Lincoln wanted to name then-Commander Dahlgren to the post of commander of the Washington Navy Yard. By law, however, that position could only be held by an officer with a rank of captain or above. Lincoln successfully persuaded Congress to pass a special act legalizing Dahlgren&#x27;s appointment to the yard. In July 1862, Dahlgren was promoted to captain and made chief of the Bureau of Ordnance. In February 1863, Dahlgren was promoted to rear admiral and took command of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. In 1864, he helped William Tecumseh Sherman secure Savannah, Georgia.

Dahlgren&#x27;s eldest son Charles Bunker Dahlgren (1839–1912), who had studied steam engineering, joined the U.S. Navy at the start of the Civil War and served with distinction, receiving several promotions and ending as the rank of captain. However, he declined offers to continue in federal service after the war. Among other incidents, Charles Dahlgren commanded the siege battery of 9-inch Dahlgren shell-guns which destroyed the powerful Confederate batteries at the Battle of Vicksburg, and served under his father during the blockade of Charleston.

Another of Dahlgren&#x27;s sons, Colonel Ulric Dahlgren, was killed on March 2, 1864, in a cavalry raid on Richmond, Virginia, while carrying out an assassination plot against Jefferson Davis and the Confederate Cabinet. The plot became known as the Dahlgren Affair. The admiral was deeply troubled by Ulric&#x27;s death and role in this event, as well as reports of the disrespectful treatment of the corpse before Richmond spymaster Elizabeth Van Lew secured its proper burial.

His brother William also spied on Confederate purchasing agents in England during the war. However, despite Radical Republican associations, John Dahlgren&#x27;s younger brother Charles G. Dahlgren (1811–1888), a banker and slave owner, became a Confederate brigadier general, commander of the 3rd Brigade, Army of Mississippi, which he personally recruited and funded, until his troops&#x27; integration into the regular Confederate army and removal by Jefferson Davis in 1862.

==Personal life==
Dahlgren had three sons from his first marriage to Mary Bunker (1839). Admiral Dahlgren&#x27;s eldest son, Charles Bunker Dahlgren, was an engineer and captain in the Union Navy. After his father&#x27;s death, he would write and present many technical papers on military weaponry, including the Dahlgren gun. Ulric Dahlgren (1842–1864) was a soldier in the Union Army and was killed in an unsuccessful mission to liberate Federal prisoners in Libby Prison and Belle Isle. Another son, Paul Dahlgren, also in the army, died in 1876 while serving as consul general in Rome.

In 1865, Dahlgren married his second wife, Madeleine Vinton, daughter of Congressman Samuel Finley Vinton and Romaine Madeleine Bureau, and the widow of Daniel Convers Goddard, first assistant secretary of the newly created U.S. Department of the Interior. Madeleine was a well-known author in her own right. Their children were John Vinton Dahlgren, who married Elizabeth Wharton Drexel; Eric Bernard Dahlgren Sr., who married Lucy Wharton Drexel; and Ulrica Dahlgren, who married Josiah Pierce, and was the grandmother of Romaine Dahlgren Pierce, wife of David Mountbatten, 3rd Marquess of Milford Haven.

==Final years and death==

Dahlgren took command of the South Pacific Squadron from Rear Admiral George F. Pearson in 1867. When he was relieved of the squadron&#x27;s command in 1868, he returned to the Washington Navy Yard, where he again served as chief of the Bureau of Ordnance until 1869, and then as commandant of the yard until his death on July 12, 1870, at age 60.

He is buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery, Section L50 to 54, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

==Legacy==

The Naval station in Dahlgren, Virginia, Dahlgren Hall at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, several ships, Dahlgren, Illinois, and Dahlgren Township, Minnesota are all named for him

<text>A graphic novel is a self-contained, book-length form of sequential art. The term &quot;graphic novel&quot; is often applied broadly, including fiction, non-fiction, and anthologized work, though this practice is highly contested by comics scholars and industry professionals. It is, at least in the United States, typically distinct from the term &quot;comic book&quot;, which is generally used for comics periodicals and trade paperbacks.

Fan historian Richard Kyle coined the term &quot;graphic novel&quot; in an essay in the November 1964 issue of the comics fanzine &quot;Capa-Alpha&quot;. The term gained popularity in the comics community after the publication of Will Eisner&#x27;s &quot;A Contract with God&quot; (1978) and the start of the &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; line (1982) and became familiar to the public in the late 1980s after the commercial successes of the first volume of Art Spiegelman&#x27;s &quot;Maus&quot; in 1986, the collected editions of Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; in 1986 and Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons&#x27; &quot;Watchmen&quot; in 1987. The Book Industry Study Group began using &quot;graphic novel&quot; as a category in book stores in 2001.

== Definition ==
The term is not strictly defined, though Merriam-Webster&#x27;s dictionary definition is &quot;a fictional story that is presented in comic-strip format and published as a book&quot;. Collections of comic books that do not form a continuous story, anthologies or collections of loosely related pieces, and even non-fiction are stocked by libraries and bookstores as graphic novels (similar to the manner in which dramatic stories are included in &quot;comic&quot; books). The term is also sometimes used to distinguish between works created as standalone stories, in contrast to collections or compilations of a story arc from a comic book series published in book form.

In continental Europe, both original book-length stories such as &quot;The Ballad of the Salty Sea&quot; (1967) by Hugo Pratt or (1967) by Guido Buzzelli, and collections of comics have been commonly published in hardcover volumes, often called &quot;albums&quot;, since the end of the 19th century (including such later Franco-Belgian comics series as &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; in the 1930s).

== History ==
As the exact definition of the graphic novel is debated, the origins of the form are open to interpretation.

&quot;The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck&quot; is the oldest recognized American example of comics used to this end. It originated as the 1828 publication &quot;Histoire de Mr. Vieux Bois&quot; by Swiss caricaturist Rodolphe Töpffer, and was first published in English translation in 1841 by London&#x27;s Tilt &amp; Bogue, which used an 1833 Paris pirate edition. The first American edition was published in 1842 by Wilson &amp; Company in New York City using the original printing plates from the 1841 edition. Another early predecessor is &quot;Journey to the Gold Diggins by Jeremiah Saddlebags&quot; by brothers J. A. D. and D. F. Read, inspired by &quot;The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck&quot;. In 1894, Caran d&#x27;Ache broached the idea of a &quot;drawn novel&quot; in a letter to the newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; and started work on a 360-page wordless book (which was never published). In the United States, there is a long tradition of reissuing previously published comic strips in book form. In 1897, the Hearst Syndicate published such a collection of &quot;The Yellow Kid&quot; by Richard Outcault and it quickly became a best seller.

=== 1920s to 1960s ===
The 1920s saw a revival of the medieval woodcut tradition, with Belgian Frans Masereel cited as &quot;the undisputed king&quot; of this revival. His works include &quot;Passionate Journey&quot; (1919). American Lynd Ward also worked in this tradition, publishing &quot;Gods&#x27; Man&quot;, in 1929 and going on to publish more during the 1930s.

Other prototypical examples from this period include American Milt Gross&#x27;s &quot;He Done Her Wrong&quot; (1930), a wordless comic published as a hardcover book, and &quot;Une semaine de bonté&quot; (1934), a novel in sequential images composed of collage by the surrealist painter Max Ernst. Similarly, Charlotte Salomon&#x27;s &quot;Life? or Theater?&quot; (composed 1941–43) combines images, narrative, and captions.
The 1940s saw the launching of &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot;, a comic-book series that primarily adapted notable, public domain novels into standalone comic books for young readers. &quot;Citizen 13660&quot;, an illustrated, novel length retelling of Japanese internment during World War II, was published in 1946. In 1947, Fawcett Comics published &quot;Comics Novel&quot; #1: &quot;Anarcho, Dictator of Death&quot;, a 52-page comic dedicated to one story. In 1950, St. John Publications produced the digest-sized, adult-oriented &quot;picture novel&quot; &quot;It Rhymes with Lust&quot;, a film noir-influenced slice of steeltown life starring a scheming, manipulative redhead named Rust. Touted as &quot;an original full-length novel&quot; on its cover, the 128-page digest by pseudonymous writer &quot;Drake Waller&quot; (Arnold Drake and Leslie Waller), penciler Matt Baker and inker Ray Osrin proved successful enough to lead to an unrelated second picture novel, &quot;The Case of the Winking Buddha&quot; by pulp novelist Manning Lee Stokes and illustrator Charles Raab. In the same year, Gold Medal Books released &quot;Mansion of Evil&quot; by Joseph Millard. Presaging Will Eisner&#x27;s multiple-story graphic novel &quot;A Contract with God&quot; (1978), cartoonist Harvey Kurtzman wrote and drew the four-story mass-market paperback &quot;Harvey Kurtzman&#x27;s Jungle Book&quot; (Ballantine Books #338K), published in 1959.

By the late 1960s, American comic book creators were becoming more adventurous with the form. Gil Kane and Archie Goodwin self-published a 40-page, magazine-format comics novel, &quot;His Name Is... Savage&quot; (Adventure House Press) in 1968—the same year Marvel Comics published two issues of &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; in a similar format. Columnist and comic-book writer Steven Grant also argues that Stan Lee and Steve Ditko&#x27;s Doctor Strange story in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #130–146, although published serially from 1965 to 1966, is &quot;the first American graphic novel&quot;. Similarly, critic Jason Sacks referred to the 13-issue &quot;Panther&#x27;s Rage&quot;—comics&#x27; first-known titled, self-contained, multi-issue story arc—that ran from 1973 to 1975 in the Black Panther series in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Jungle Action&quot; as &quot;Marvel&#x27;s first graphic novel&quot;.

Meanwhile, in continental Europe, the tradition of collecting serials of popular strips such as &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; or &quot;Asterix&quot; led to long-form narratives published initially as serials.

In January 1968, &quot;Vida del Che&quot; was published in Argentina, a graphic novel written by Héctor Germán Oesterheld and drawn by Alberto Breccia. The book told the story of Che Guevara in comics form, but the military dictatorship confiscated the books and destroyed them. It was later re-released in corrected versions.

By 1969, the author John Updike, who had entertained ideas of becoming a cartoonist in his youth, addressed the Bristol Literary Society, on &quot;the death of the novel&quot;. Updike offered examples of new areas of exploration for novelists, declaring he saw &quot;no intrinsic reason why a doubly talented artist might not arise and create a comic strip novel masterpiece&quot;.

=== Modern era ===

Gil Kane and Archie Goodwin&#x27;s &quot;Blackmark&quot; (1971), a science fiction/sword-and-sorcery paperback published by Bantam Books, did not use the term originally; the back-cover blurb of the 30th-anniversary edition () calls it, retroactively, the first American graphic novel. The Academy of Comic Book Arts presented Kane with a special 1971 Shazam Award for what it called &quot;his paperback comics novel&quot;. Whatever the nomenclature, &quot;Blackmark&quot; is a 119-page story of comic-book art, with captions and word balloons, published in a traditional book format.

European creators were also experimenting with the longer narrative in comics form. In the United Kingdom, Raymond Briggs was producing works such as &quot;Father Christmas&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Snowman&quot; (1978), which he himself described as being from the &quot;bottomless abyss of strip cartooning&quot;, although they, along with such other Briggs works as the more mature &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot; (1982), have been re-marketed as graphic novels in the wake of the term&#x27;s popularity. Briggs noted, however, that he did not like that term too much.

=== First self-proclaimed graphic novels: 1976–1978 ===

In 1976, the term &quot;graphic novel&quot; appeared in print to describe three separate works: 
* &quot;&quot; by Jim Steranko, published in August 1976 under the Fiction Illustrated imprint and released in both regular 8.5 x 11&quot; size, and a digest size designed to be sold on newsstands, used the term &quot;graphic novel&quot; in its introduction and &quot;a visual novel&quot; on its cover, predating by two years the usage of this term for Will Eisner&#x27;s &quot;A Contract with God&quot;. It is therefore considered the first modern graphic novel to be done as an original work, and not collected from previously published segments.
* &quot;Bloodstar&quot; by Richard Corben (adapted from a story by Robert E. Howard), Morning Star Press, 1976, also a non-reprinted original presentation, used the term &#x27;graphic novel&#x27; to categorize itself as well on its dust jacket and introduction.
* George Metzger&#x27;s &quot;Beyond Time and Again&quot;, serialized in underground comix from 1967 to 1972, was subtitled &quot;A Graphic Novel&quot; on the inside title page when collected as a 48-page, black-and-white, hardcover book published by Kyle &amp; Wheary.

The following year, Terry Nantier, who had spent his teenage years living in Paris, returned to the United States and formed Flying Buttress Publications, later to incorporate as NBM Publishing (Nantier, Beall, Minoustchine), and published &quot;Racket Rumba&quot;, a 50-page spoof of the noir-detective genre, written and drawn by the single-name French artist Loro. Nantier followed this with Enki Bilal&#x27;s &quot;The Call of the Stars&quot;. The company marketed these works as &quot;graphic albums&quot;.

The first six issues of writer-artist Jack Katz&#x27;s 1974 Comics and Comix Co. series &quot;The First Kingdom&quot; were collected as a trade paperback (Pocket Books, March 1978), which described itself as &quot;the first graphic novel&quot;. Issues of the comic had described themselves as &quot;graphic prose&quot;, or simply as a novel.

Similarly, &quot;Sabre: Slow Fade of an Endangered Species&quot; by writer Don McGregor and artist Paul Gulacy (Eclipse Books, August 1978) — the first graphic novel sold in the newly created &quot;direct market&quot; of United States comic-book shops — was called a &quot;graphic album&quot; by the author in interviews, though the publisher dubbed it a &quot;comic novel&quot; on its credits page. &quot;Graphic album&quot; was also the term used the following year by Gene Day for his hardcover short-story collection &quot;Future Day&quot; (Flying Buttress Press).

Another early graphic novel, though it carried no self-description, was &quot;The Silver Surfer&quot; (Simon &amp; Schuster/Fireside Books, August 1978), by Marvel Comics&#x27; Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Significantly, this was published by a traditional book publisher and distributed through bookstores, as was cartoonist Jules Feiffer&#x27;s &quot;Tantrum&quot; (Alfred A. Knopf, 1979) described on its dust jacket as a &quot;novel-in-pictures&quot;.

=== Adoption of the term ===

Hyperbolic descriptions of longer comic books as &quot;novels&quot; appear on covers as early as the 1940s. Early issues of DC Comics&#x27; &quot;All-Flash&quot;, for example, described their contents as &quot;novel-length stories&quot; and &quot;full-length four chapter novels&quot;.

In its earliest known citation, comic-book reviewer Richard Kyle used the term &quot;graphic novel&quot; in &quot;Capa-Alpha&quot; #2 (November 1964), a newsletter published by the Comic Amateur Press Alliance, and again in an article in Bill Spicer&#x27;s magazine &quot;Fantasy Illustrated&quot; #5 (Spring 1966). Kyle, inspired by European and East Asian graphic albums (especially Japanese &quot;manga&quot;), used the label to designate comics of an artistically &quot;serious&quot; sort. Following this, Spicer, with Kyle&#x27;s acknowledgment, edited and published a periodical titled &quot;Graphic Story Magazine&quot; in the fall of 1967. &quot;The Sinister House of Secret Love&quot; #2 (Jan. 1972), one of DC Comics&#x27; line of extra-length, 48-page comics, specifically used the phrase &quot;a graphic novel of Gothic terror&quot; on its cover.

The term &quot;graphic novel&quot; began to grow in popularity months after it appeared on the cover of the trade paperback edition (though not the hardcover edition) of Will Eisner&#x27;s &quot;A Contract with God&quot; (October 1978). This collection of short stories was a mature, complex work focusing on the lives of ordinary people in the real world based on Eisner&#x27;s own experiences.

One scholar used graphic novels to introduce the concept of graphiation, the theory that the entire personality of an artist is visible through his or her visual representation of a certain character, setting, event, or object in a novel, and can work as a means to examine and analyze drawing style.

Even though Eisner&#x27;s &quot;A Contract with God&quot; was published in 1978 by a smaller company, Baronet Press, it took Eisner over a year to find a publishing house that would allow his work to reach the mass market. In its introduction, Eisner cited Lynd Ward&#x27;s 1930s woodcuts as an inspiration.

The critical and commercial success of &quot;A Contract with God&quot; helped to establish the term &quot;graphic novel&quot; in common usage, and many sources have incorrectly credited Eisner with being the first to use it. These included the &quot;Time&quot; magazine website in 2003, which said in its correction: &quot;Eisner acknowledges that the term &#x27;graphic novel&#x27; had been coined prior to his book. But, he says, &#x27;I had not known at the time that someone had used that term before&#x27;. Nor does he take credit for creating the first graphic book&quot;.
One of the earliest contemporaneous applications of the term post-Eisner came in 1979, when &quot;Blackmark&quot; sequel—published a year after &quot;A Contract with God&quot; though written and drawn in the early 1970s—was labeled a &quot;graphic novel&quot; on the cover of Marvel Comics&#x27; black-and-white comics magazine &quot;Marvel Preview&quot; #17 (Winter 1979), where &quot;Blackmark: The Mind Demons&quot; premiered: its 117-page contents remained intact, but its panel-layout reconfigured to fit 62 pages.

Following this, Marvel from 1982 to 1988 published the &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; line of 10&quot; × 7&quot; trade paperbacks—although numbering them like comic books, from #1 (Jim Starlin&#x27;s &quot;The Death of Captain Marvel&quot;) to #35 (Dennis O&#x27;Neil, Mike Kaluta, and Russ Heath&#x27;s &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Astrologer&quot;, starring the radio and pulp fiction character the Shadow, and released in hardcover). Marvel commissioned original graphic novels from such creators as John Byrne, J. M. DeMatteis, Steve Gerber, graphic-novel pioneer McGregor, Frank Miller, Bill Sienkiewicz, Walt Simonson, Charles Vess, and Bernie Wrightson. While most of these starred Marvel superheroes, others, such as Rick Veitch&#x27;s &quot;Heartburst&quot; featured original SF/fantasy characters; others still, such as John J. Muth&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;, featured adaptations of literary stories or characters; and one, Sam Glanzman&#x27;s &quot;A Sailor&#x27;s Story&quot;, was a true-life, World War II naval tale.
Cartoonist Art Spiegelman&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;Maus&quot; (1986), helped establish both the term and the concept of graphic novels in the minds of the mainstream public. Two DC Comics book reprints of self-contained miniseries did likewise, though they were not originally published as graphic novels: &quot;&quot; (1986), a collection of Frank Miller&#x27;s four-part comic-book series featuring an older Batman faced with the problems of a dystopian future; and &quot;Watchmen&quot; (1986-1987), a collection of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons&#x27; 12-issue limited series in which Moore notes he &quot;set out to explore, amongst other things, the dynamics of power in a post-Hiroshima world&quot;. These works and others were reviewed in newspapers and magazines, leading to increased coverage. Sales of graphic novels increased, with &quot;Batman: The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, for example, lasting 40 weeks on a UK best-seller list.

=== European adoption of the term ===
Outside North America, Eisner&#x27;s &quot;A Contract with God&quot; and Spiegelman&#x27;s &quot;Maus&quot; led to the popularization of the expression &quot;graphic novel&quot; as well. Until then, most European countries used neutral, descriptive terminology that referred to the form of the medium, not the contents or the publishing form. In Francophone Europe for example, the expression &quot;bandes dessinées&quot; — which literally translates as &quot;drawn strips&quot; – is used, while the terms &quot;stripverhaal&quot; (&quot;strip story&quot;) and &quot;tegneserie&quot; (&quot;drawn series&quot;) are used by the Dutch/Flemish and Scandinavians respectively. European comics studies scholars have observed that Americans originally used &quot;graphic novel&quot; for everything that deviated from their standard, 32-page comic book format, meaning that all larger-sized, longer Franco-Belgian comic albums, regardless of their contents, fell under the heading.

Writer-artist Bryan Talbot claims that the first collection of his &quot;The Adventures of Luther Arkwright&quot;, published by Proutt in 1982, was the first British graphic novel.

American comic critics have occasionally referred to European graphic novels as &quot;Euro-comics&quot;, and attempts were made in the late 1980s to cross-fertilize the American market with these works. American publishers Catalan Communications and NBM Publishing released translated titles, predominantly from the backlog catalogs of Casterman and Les Humanoïdes Associés.

== Criticism of the term ==
Some in the comics community have objected to the term &quot;graphic novel&quot; on the grounds that it is unnecessary, or that its usage has been corrupted by commercial interests. &quot;Watchmen&quot; writer Alan Moore believes:
Glen Weldon, author and cultural critic, writes:
Author Daniel Raeburn wrote: &quot;I snicker at the neologism first for its insecure pretension - the literary equivalent of calling a garbage man a &#x27;sanitation engineer&#x27; - and second because a &#x27;graphic novel&#x27; is in fact the very thing it is ashamed to admit: a comic book, rather than a comic pamphlet or comic magazine&quot;.

Writer Neil Gaiman, responding to a claim that he does not write comic books but graphic novels, said the commenter &quot;meant it as a compliment, I suppose. But all of a sudden I felt like someone who&#x27;d been informed that she wasn&#x27;t actually a hooker; that in fact she was a lady of the evening&quot;.

Responding to writer Douglas Wolk&#x27;s quip that the difference between a graphic novel and a comic book is &quot;the binding&quot;, &quot;Bone&quot; creator Jeff Smith said: &quot;I kind of like that answer. Because &#x27;graphic novel&#x27; ... I don&#x27;t like that name. It&#x27;s trying too hard. It is a comic book. But there is a difference. And the difference is, a graphic novel is a novel in the sense that there is a beginning, a middle and an end&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; writer Giles Coren said: &quot;To call them graphic novels is to presume that the novel is in some way &#x27;higher&#x27; than the karmicbwurk (comic book), and that only by being thought of as a sort of novel can it be understood as an art form&quot;.

Some alternative cartoonists have coined their own terms for extended comics narratives. The cover of Daniel Clowes&#x27; &quot;Ice Haven&quot; (2001) refers to the book as &quot;a comic-strip novel&quot;, with Clowes having noted that he &quot;never saw anything wrong with the comic book&quot;. The cover of Craig Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Blankets&quot; calls it &quot;an illustrated novel&quot;.

<text>Huey Pierce Long Jr. (August 30, 1893September 10, 1935), nicknamed &quot;The Kingfish&quot;, was an American politician who served as the 40th governor of Louisiana from 1928 to 1932 and as a United States senator from 1932 until his assassination in 1935. He was a left-wing populist member of the Democratic Party and rose to national prominence during the Great Depression for his vocal criticism of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal, which Long deemed insufficiently radical. As the political leader of Louisiana, he commanded wide networks of supporters and often took forceful action. A controversial figure, Long is celebrated as a populist champion of the poor or, conversely, denounced as a fascist demagogue.

Long was born in the impoverished north of Louisiana in 1893. After working as a traveling salesman and briefly attending three colleges, he was admitted to the bar in Louisiana. Following a short career as an attorney, in which he frequently represented poor plaintiffs, Long was elected to the Louisiana Public Service Commission. As Commissioner, he prosecuted large corporations such as Standard Oil, a lifelong target of his rhetorical attacks. After Long successfully argued before the U.S. Supreme Court, Chief Justice and former president William Howard Taft praised him as &quot;the most brilliant lawyer who ever practiced before the United States Supreme Court&quot;.

After a failed 1924 campaign, Long appealed to the sharp economic and class divisions in Louisiana to win the 1928 gubernatorial election. Once in office, he expanded social programs, organized massive public works projects, such as a modern highway system and the tallest capitol building in the nation, and proposed a cotton holiday. Through political maneuvering, Long became the political boss of Louisiana. He was impeached in 1929 for abuses of power, but the proceedings collapsed in the State Senate. His opponents argued his policies and methods were unconstitutional and authoritarian. At its climax, Long&#x27;s political opposition organized a minor insurrection in 1935.

Long was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1930 but did not assume his seat until 1932. He established himself as an isolationist, arguing that Standard Oil and Wall Street orchestrated American foreign policy. He was instrumental in securing Roosevelt&#x27;s 1932 nomination but split with him in 1933, becoming a prominent critic of his New Deal. As an alternative, he proposed the Share Our Wealth plan in 1934. To stimulate the economy, he advocated massive federal spending, a wealth tax, and wealth redistribution. These proposals drew widespread support, with millions joining local Share Our Wealth clubs. Poised for a 1936 presidential bid, Long was assassinated by Carl Weiss inside the Louisiana State Capitol in 1935. His assassin was immediately shot and killed by Long&#x27;s bodyguards. Although Long&#x27;s movement faded, Roosevelt adopted many of his proposals in the Second New Deal, and Louisiana politics would be organized along anti- or pro-Long factions until the 1960s. He left behind a political dynasty that included his wife, Senator Rose McConnell Long; his son, Senator Russell B. Long; and his brother, Governor Earl Long, among others.

==Early life (1893–1915)==

===Childhood===
Huey Pierce Long Jr. was born on August 30, 1893, near Winnfield, a small town in north-central Louisiana, the seat of Winn Parish. Although Long often told followers he was born in a log cabin to an impoverished family, they lived in a &quot;comfortable&quot; farmhouse and were well-off compared to others in Winnfield. Winn Parish was impoverished, and its residents, mostly Southern Baptists, were often outsiders in Louisiana&#x27;s political system. During the Civil War, Winn Parish had been a stronghold of Unionism in an otherwise Confederate state. At Louisiana&#x27;s 1861 convention on secession, the delegate from Winn voted to remain in the Union saying: &quot;Who wants to fight to keep the Negroes for the wealthy planters?&quot; In the 1890s, the parish was a bastion of the Populist Party, and in the 1912 election, Socialist presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs received 35% of the vote. Long embraced these populist sentiments.

One of nine children, Long was home-schooled until age eleven. In the public system, he earned a reputation as an excellent student with a remarkable memory and convinced his teachers to let him skip seventh grade. At Winnfield High School, he and his friends formed a secret society, advertising their exclusivity by wearing a red ribbon. According to Long, his club&#x27;s mission was &quot;to run things, laying down certain rules the students would have to follow&quot;. The faculty learned of Long&#x27;s antics and warned him to obey the school&#x27;s rules. Long continued to rebel, writing and distributing a flyer that criticized his teachers and the necessity of a recently state-mandated fourth year of secondary education, for which he was expelled in 1910. Although Long successfully petitioned to fire the principal, he never returned to high school. As a student, Long proved a capable debater. At a state debate competition in Baton Rouge, he won a full-tuition scholarship to Louisiana State University (LSU). Because the scholarship did not cover textbooks or living expenses, his family could not afford for him to attend. Long was also unable to attend because he did not graduate from high school. Instead, he entered the workforce as a traveling salesman in the rural South.

===Education and marriage===
In September 1911, Long started attending seminary classes at Oklahoma Baptist University at the urging of his mother, a devout Baptist. Living with his brother George, Long attended for only one semester, rarely appearing at lectures. After deciding he was unsuited to preaching, Long focused on law. Borrowing one hundred dollars from his brother (which he later lost playing roulette in Oklahoma City), he attended the University of Oklahoma College of Law for a semester in 1912. To earn money while studying law part-time, he continued to work as a salesman. Of the four classes Long took, he received one incomplete and three C&#x27;s. He later confessed he learned little because there was &quot;too much excitement, all those gambling houses and everything&quot;.

Long met Rose McConnell at a baking contest he had promoted to sell Cottolene shortening. The two began a two-and-a-half-year courtship and married in April 1913 at the Gayoso Hotel in Memphis, Tennessee. On their wedding day, Long had no cash with him and had to borrow $10 from his fiancée to pay the officiant. Shortly after their marriage, Long revealed to his wife his aspirations to run for a statewide office, the governorship, the Senate, and ultimately the presidency. The Longs had a daughter named Rose (1917–2006) and two sons: Russell B. Long (1918–2003), who became a U.S. senator, and Palmer Reid Long (1921–2010), who became an oilman in Shreveport, Louisiana.

Long enrolled at Tulane University Law School in New Orleans in the fall of 1914. After a year of study that concentrated on the courses necessary for the bar exam, he successfully petitioned the Louisiana Supreme Court for permission to take the test before its scheduled June 1915 date. He was examined in May, passed, and received his license to practice. According to Long: &quot;I came out of that courtroom running for office.&quot;

==Legal career (1915–1923)==
In 1915, Long established a private practice in Winnfield. He represented poor plaintiffs, usually in workers&#x27; compensation cases. Long avoided fighting in World War I by obtaining a draft deferment on the grounds that he was married and had a dependent child. He successfully defended from prosecution under the Espionage Act of 1917 the state senator who had loaned him the money to complete his legal studies, and later claimed he did not serve because, &quot;I was not mad at anybody over there.&quot; In 1918, Long invested $1,050 () in a well that struck oil. The Standard Oil Company refused to accept any of the oil in its pipelines, costing Long his investment. This episode served as the catalyst for Long&#x27;s lifelong hatred of Standard Oil.

That same year, Long entered the race to serve on the three-seat Louisiana Railroad Commission. According to historian William Ivy Hair, Long&#x27;s political message:

... would be repeated until the end of his days: he was a young warrior of and for the plain people, battling the evil giants of Wall Street and their corporations; too much of America&#x27;s wealth was concentrated in too few hands, and this unfairness was perpetuated by an educational system so stacked against the poor that (according to his statistics) only fourteen out of every thousand children obtained a college education. The way to begin rectifying these wrongs was to turn out of office the corrupt local flunkies of big business ... and elect instead true men of the people, such as [himself].

In the Democratic primary, Long polled second behind incumbent Burk Bridges. Since no candidate garnered a majority of the votes, a run-off election was held, for which Long campaigned tirelessly across northern Louisiana. The race was close: Long defeated Burk by just 636 votes. Although the returns revealed wide support for Long in rural areas, he performed poorly in urban areas. On the Commission, Long forced utilities to lower rates, ordered railroads to extend service to small towns, and demanded that Standard Oil cease the importation of Mexican crude oil and use more oil from Louisiana wells.

In the gubernatorial election of 1920, Long campaigned heavily for John M. Parker; today, he is often credited with helping Parker win northern parishes. After Parker was elected, the two became bitter rivals. Their break was largely caused by Long&#x27;s demand and Parker&#x27;s refusal to declare the state&#x27;s oil pipelines public utilities. Long was infuriated when Parker allowed oil companies, led by Standard Oil&#x27;s legal team, to assist in writing severance tax laws. Long denounced Parker as corporate &quot;chattel&quot;. The feud climaxed in 1921, when Parker tried unsuccessfully to have Long ousted from the commission.

By 1922, Long had become chairman of the commission, now called the &quot;Public Service Commission&quot;. That year, Long prosecuted the Cumberland Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company for unfair rate increases; he successfully argued the case on appeal before the United States Supreme Court, which resulted in cash refunds to thousands of overcharged customers. After the decision, Chief Justice and former President William Howard Taft praised Long as &quot;the most brilliant lawyer who ever practiced&quot; before the court.

==Gubernatorial campaigns (1924–1928)==

===1924 election===
On August 30, 1923, Long announced his candidacy for the governorship of Louisiana. Long stumped throughout the state, personally distributing circulars and posters. He denounced Governor Parker as a corporate stooge, vilified Standard Oil, and assailed local political bosses.

He campaigned in rural areas disenfranchised by the state&#x27;s political establishment, the &quot;Old Regulars&quot;. Since the 1877 end of Republican-controlled Reconstruction government, they had controlled most of the state through alliances with local officials. With negligible support for Republicans, Louisiana was essentially a one party state under the Democratic Old Regulars. Holding mock elections in which they invoked the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, the Old Regulars presided over a corrupt government that largely benefited the planter class. Consequently, Louisiana was one of the least developed states: It had just 300 miles of paved roads and the lowest literacy rate.

Despite an enthusiastic campaign, Long came third in the primary and was eliminated. Although polls projected only a few thousand votes, he attracted almost 72,000, around 31% of the electorate, and carried 28 parishes—more than either opponent. Limited to sectional appeal, he performed best in the poor rural north.

The Ku Klux Klan&#x27;s prominence in Louisiana was the campaign&#x27;s primary issue. While the two other candidates either strongly opposed or supported the Klan, Long remained neutral, alienating both sides. He also failed to attract Catholic voters, which limited his chances in the south of the state. In majority Catholic New Orleans, he polled just 12,000 votes (17%). Long blamed heavy rain on election day for suppressing voter turnout among his base in the north, where voters could not reach the polls over dirt roads that had turned to mud. It was the only election Long ever lost.

===1928 election===
Long spent the intervening four years building his reputation and political organization, particularly in the heavily Catholic urban south. Despite disagreeing with their politics, Long campaigned for Catholic U.S. Senators in 1924 and 1926. Government mismanagement during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 gained Long the support of Cajuns, whose land had been affected. He formally launched his second campaign for governor in 1927, using the slogan, &quot;Every man a king, but no one wears a crown&quot;, a phrase adopted from Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan.

Long developed novel campaign techniques, including the use of sound trucks and radio commercials. His stance on race was unorthodox. According to T. Harry Williams, Long was &quot;the first Southern mass leader to leave aside race baiting and appeals to the Southern tradition and the Southern past and address himself to the social and economic problems of the present&quot;. The campaign sometimes descended into brutality. When the 60-year-old incumbent governor called Long a liar during a chance encounter in the lobby of the Roosevelt Hotel, Long punched him in the face.

In the Democratic primary election, Long polled 126,842 votes: a plurality of 43.9 percent. His margin was the largest in state history, and no opponent chose to face him in a runoff. After earning the Democratic nomination, he easily defeated the Republican nominee in the general election with 96.1 percent of the vote. At age 35, Long was the youngest person ever elected governor of Louisiana.

Some fifteen thousand Louisianians traveled to Baton Rouge for Long&#x27;s inauguration. He set up large tents, free drinks, and jazz bands on the capitol grounds, evoking Andrew Jackson&#x27;s 1829 inaugural festivities. His victory was seen as a public backlash against the urban establishment; journalist Hodding Carter described it as a &quot;fantastic vengeance upon the Sodom and Gomorrah that was called New Orleans&quot;. While previous elections were normally divided culturally and religiously, Long highlighted the sharp economic divide in the state and built a new coalition based on class. Long&#x27;s strength, said the contemporary novelist Sherwood Anderson, relied on &quot;the terrible South ... the beaten, ignorant, Bible-ridden, white South. Faulkner occasionally really touches it. It has yet to be paid for.&quot;

==Louisiana governorship (1928–1932)==

===First year===

Once in office on May 21, 1928, Long moved quickly to consolidate power, firing hundreds of opponents in the state bureaucracy at all ranks from cabinet-level heads of departments to state road workers. Like previous governors, he filled the vacancies with patronage appointments from his network of political supporters. Every state employee who depended on Long for a job was expected to pay a portion of their salary at election time directly into his campaign fund.

Once his control over the state&#x27;s political apparatus was strengthened, Long pushed several bills through the 1929 session of the Louisiana State Legislature to fulfill campaign promises. His bills met opposition from legislators, wealthy citizens, and the media, but Long used aggressive tactics to ensure passage. He would appear unannounced on the floor of both the House and Senate or in House committees, corralling reluctant representatives and state senators and bullying opponents. When an opposing legislator once suggested Long was unfamiliar with the Louisiana Constitution, he declared, &quot;I&#x27;m the Constitution around here now.&quot;

One program Long approved was a free textbook program for schoolchildren. Long&#x27;s free school books angered Catholics, who usually sent their children to private schools. Long assured them that the books would be granted directly to all children, regardless of whether they attended public school. Yet this assurance was criticized by conservative constitutionalists, who claimed it violated the separation of church and state and sued Long. The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in Long&#x27;s favor.

Irritated by &quot;immoral&quot; gambling dens and brothels in New Orleans, Long sent the National Guard to raid these establishments with orders to &quot;shoot without hesitation&quot;. Gambling equipment was burned, prostitutes were arrested, and over $25,000 () was confiscated for government funds. Local newspapers ran photos of National Guardsmen forcibly searching nude women. City authorities had not requested military force, and martial law had not been declared. The Louisiana attorney general denounced Long&#x27;s actions as illegal but Long rebuked him, saying: &quot;Nobody asked him for his opinion.&quot;

Despite wide disapproval, Long had the Governor&#x27;s Mansion, built in 1887, razed by convicts from the State Penitentiary under his personal supervision. In its place, Long had a much larger Georgian mansion built. It bore a strong resemblance to the White House; he reportedly wanted to be familiar with the residence when he became president.

===Impeachment===

In 1929, Long called a special legislative session to enact a five-cent per barrel tax on refined oil production to fund his social programs. The state&#x27;s oil interests opposed the bill. Long declared in a radio address that any legislator who refused to support the tax had been &quot;bought&quot; by oil companies. Instead of persuading the legislature, the accusation infuriated many of its members. The &quot;dynamite squad&quot;, a caucus of opponents led by freshman lawmakers Cecil Morgan and Ralph Norman Bauer, introduced an impeachment resolution against Long. Nineteen charges were listed, ranging from blasphemy to subornation of murder. Even Long&#x27;s lieutenant governor, Paul Cyr, supported impeachment; he accused Long of nepotism and alleged he had made corrupt deals with a Texas oil company.

Concerned, Long tried to close the session. Pro-Long Speaker John B. Fournet called for a vote to adjourn. Despite most representatives opposing adjournment, the electronic voting board tallied 68 ayes and 13 nays. This sparked confusion; anti-Long representatives began chanting that the voting machine had been rigged. Some ran for the speaker&#x27;s chair to call for a new vote but met resistance from their pro-Long colleagues, sparking a brawl later known as &quot;Bloody Monday&quot;. In the scuffle, legislators threw inkwells, allegedly attacked others with brass knuckles, and Long&#x27;s brother Earl bit a legislator&#x27;s neck. Following the fight, the legislature voted to remain in session and proceed with impeachment. Proceedings in the house took place with dozens of witnesses, including a hula dancer who claimed that Long had been &quot;frisky&quot; with her. Impeached on eight of the 19 charges, Long was the third Louisiana governor charged in the state&#x27;s history, following Reconstruction Republicans Henry Clay Warmoth and William Pitt Kellogg.

Long was frightened by the prospect of conviction, for it would force him from the governorship and permanently disqualify him from holding public office in Louisiana. He took his case to the people with a mass meeting in Baton Rouge, where he alleged that impeachment was a ploy by Standard Oil to thwart his programs. The House referred the charges to the Louisiana Senate, in which conviction required a two-thirds majority. Long produced a round robin statement signed by fifteen senators pledging to vote &quot;not guilty&quot; regardless of the evidence. The impeachment process, now futile, was suspended without holding an impeachment trial. It has been alleged that both sides used bribes to buy votes and that Long later rewarded the round robin signers with positions or other favors.

Following the failed impeachment attempt, Long treated his opponents ruthlessly. He fired their relatives from state jobs and supported their challengers in elections. Long concluded that extra-legal means would be needed to accomplish his goals: &quot;I used to try to get things done by saying &#x27;please.&#x27; Now... I dynamite &#x27;em out of my path.&quot; Receiving death threats, he surrounded himself with bodyguards. Now a resolute critic of the &quot;lying&quot; press, Long established his own newspaper in March 1930: the &quot;Louisiana Progress&quot;. The paper was extremely popular, widely distributed by policemen, highway workers, and government truckers.

===Senate campaign===
Shortly after the impeachment, Long—now nicknamed &quot;The Kingfish&quot; after an &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; character—announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate in the 1930 Democratic primary. He framed his campaign as a referendum. If he won, he presumed the public supported his programs over the opposition of the legislature. If he lost, he promised to resign.

His opponent was incumbent Joseph E. Ransdell, the Catholic senator whom Long endorsed in 1924. At 72 years old, Ransdell had served in the U.S. Congress since Long was aged six. Aligned with the establishment, Ransdell had the support of all 18 of the state&#x27;s daily newspapers. To combat this, Long purchased two new $30,000 sound trucks and distributed over two million circulars. Although promising not to make personal attacks, Long seized on Ransdell&#x27;s age, calling him &quot;Old Feather Duster&quot;. The campaign became increasingly vicious, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling it &quot;as amusing as it was depressing&quot;. Long critic Sam Irby, set to testify on Long&#x27;s corruption to state authorities, was abducted by Long&#x27;s bodyguards shortly before the election. Irby emerged after the election; he had been missing for four days. Surrounded by Long&#x27;s guards, he gave a radio address in which he &quot;confessed&quot; that he had actually asked Long for protection. The New Orleans mayor labelled it &quot;the most heinous public crime in Louisiana history&quot;.

Ultimately, on September 9, 1930, Long defeated Ransdell by 149,640 (57.3 percent) to 111,451 (42.7 percent). There were accusations of voter fraud against Long; voting records showed people voting in alphabetical order, among them celebrities like Charlie Chaplin, Jack Dempsey and Babe Ruth.
Although his Senate term began on March 4, 1931, Long completed most of his four-year term as governor, which did not end until May 1932. He declared that leaving the seat vacant would not hurt Louisiana: &quot;[W]ith Ransdell as Senator, the seat was vacant anyway.&quot; By occupying the governorship until January 25, 1932, Long prevented Lieutenant Governor Cyr, who threatened to undo Long&#x27;s reforms, from succeeding to the office. In October 1931, Cyr learned Long was in Mississippi and declared himself the state&#x27;s legitimate governor. In response, Long ordered National Guard troops to surround the Capitol to block Cyr&#x27;s &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; and petitioned the Louisiana Supreme Court. Long successfully argued that Cyr had vacated the office of lieutenant-governor when trying to assume the governorship and had the court eject Cyr.

===Senator-elect===
Now governor and senator-elect, Long returned to completing his legislative agenda with renewed strength. He continued his intimidating practice of presiding over the legislature, shouting &quot;Shut up!&quot; or &quot;Sit down!&quot; when legislators voiced their concerns. In a single night, Long passed 44 bills in just two hours: one every three minutes. He later explained his tactics: &quot;The end justifies the means.&quot; Long endorsed pro-Long candidates and wooed others with favors; he often joked his legislature was the &quot;finest collection of lawmakers money can buy&quot;. He organized and concentrated his power into a political machine: &quot;a one-man&quot; operation, according to Williams. He placed his brother Earl in charge of allotting patronage appointments to local politicians and signing state contracts with businessmen in exchange for loyalty. Long appointed allies to key government positions, such as giving Robert Maestri the office of Conservation Commissioner and making Oscar K. Allen head of the Louisiana Highway Commission. Maestri would deliberately neglect the regulation of energy companies in exchange for industry donations to Long&#x27;s campaign fund, while Allen took direction from Earl on which construction and supply companies to contract for road work. Concerned by these tactics, Long&#x27;s opponents charged he had become the virtual dictator of the state.

To address record low cotton prices amid a Great Depression surplus, Long proposed the major cotton-producing states mandate a 1932 &quot;cotton holiday&quot;, which would ban cotton production for the entire year. He further proposed that the holiday be imposed internationally, which some nations, such as Egypt, supported. In 1931, Long convened the New Orleans Cotton Conference, attended by delegates from every major cotton-producing state. The delegates agreed to codify Long&#x27;s proposal into law on the caveat that it would not come into effect until states producing three-quarters of U.S. cotton passed such laws. As the proposer, Louisiana unanimously passed the legislation. When conservative politicians in Texas—the largest cotton producer in the U.S.—rejected the measure, the holiday movement collapsed. Although traditional politicians would have been ruined by such a defeat, Long became a national figure and cemented his image as a champion of the poor. Senator Carter Glass, although a fervid critic of Long, credited him with first suggesting artificial scarcity as a solution to the depression.

===Accomplishments===

Long was unusual among southern populists in that he achieved tangible progress. Williams concluded &quot;the secret of Long&#x27;s power, in the final analysis, was not in his machine or his political dealings but in his record—he delivered something&quot;. Referencing Long&#x27;s contributions to Louisiana, Robert Penn Warren, a professor at LSU during Long&#x27;s term as governor, stated: &quot;Dictators, always give something for what they get.&quot;

Long created a public works program that was unprecedented in the South, constructing roads, bridges, hospitals, schools, and state buildings. During his four years as governor, Long increased paved highways in Louisiana from and constructed of gravel roads. By 1936, the infrastructure program begun by Long had completed some of new roads, doubling Louisiana&#x27;s road system. He built 111 bridges and started construction on the first bridge over the Mississippi entirely in Louisiana, the Huey P. Long Bridge. These projects provided thousands of jobs during the depression: Louisiana employed more highway workers than any other state. Long built a State Capitol, which at tall remains the tallest capitol, state or federal, in the United States. Long&#x27;s infrastructure spending increased the state government&#x27;s debt from $11 million in 1928 to $150 million in 1935.

Long was an ardent supporter of the state&#x27;s flagship public university, Louisiana State University (LSU). Having been unable to attend, Long now regarded it as &quot;his&quot; university. He increased LSU&#x27;s funding and intervened in the university&#x27;s affairs, expelling seven students who criticized him in the school newspaper. He constructed new buildings, including a fieldhouse that reportedly contained the longest pool in the United States. Long founded an LSU Medical School in New Orleans. To raise the stature of the football program, he converted the school&#x27;s military marching band into the flashy &quot;Show Band of the South&quot; and hired Costa Rican composer Castro Carazo as the band director. As well as nearly doubling the size of the stadium, he arranged for lowered train fares, so students could travel to away games. Long&#x27;s contributions resulted in LSU gaining a class A accreditation from the Association of American Universities.

Long&#x27;s night schools taught 100,000 adults to read. His provision of free textbooks contributed to a 20-percent increase in school enrollment. He modernized public health facilities and ensured adequate conditions for the mentally ill. He established Louisiana&#x27;s first rehabilitation program for penitentiary inmates. Through tax reform, Long made the first $2,000 in property assessment free, waiving property taxes for half the state&#x27;s homeowners. Some historians have criticized other policies, like high consumer taxes on gasoline and cigarettes, a reduced mother&#x27;s pension, and low teacher salaries. Several labor laws were also enacted during Long&#x27;s time as governor.

==U.S. Senate (1932–1935)==
===Senator===

When Long arrived in the Senate, America was in the throes of the Great Depression. With this backdrop, Long made characteristically fiery speeches that denounced wealth inequality. He criticized the leaders of both parties for failing to address the crisis adequately, notably attacking Senate Democratic Leader Joseph Robinson of Arkansas for his apparent closeness with President Herbert Hoover and big business.

In the 1932 presidential election, Long was a vocal supporter of New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt. At that year&#x27;s Democratic National Convention, Long kept the delegations of several wavering Southern states in the Roosevelt camp. Due to this, Long expected to be featured prominently in Roosevelt&#x27;s campaign but was disappointed with a peripheral speaking tour limited to four Midwestern states.

Not discouraged after being snubbed, Long found other venues for his populist message. He endorsed Senator Hattie Caraway of Arkansas, a widow and the underdog candidate in a crowded field and conducted a whirlwind, seven-day tour of that state. During the campaign, Long gave 39 speeches, traveled , and spoke to over 200,000 people. In an upset win, Caraway became the first woman elected to a full term in the Senate.

Returning to Washington, Long gave theatrical speeches which drew wide attention. Public viewing areas were crowded with onlookers, among them a young Lyndon B. Johnson, who later said he was &quot;simply entranced&quot; by Long. Long obstructed bills for weeks, launching hour-long filibusters and having the clerk read superfluous documents. Long&#x27;s antics, one editorial claimed, had made the Senate &quot;impotent&quot;. In May 1932, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called for his resignation. Long&#x27;s behavior and radical rhetoric did little to endear him to his fellow senators. None of his proposed bills, resolutions, or motions were passed during his three years in the Senate.

===Roosevelt and the New Deal===

During the first 100 days of Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency in spring 1933, Long&#x27;s attitude toward Roosevelt and the New Deal was tepid. Aware that Roosevelt had no intention of radically redistributing the country&#x27;s wealth, Long became one of the few national politicians to oppose Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal policies from the left. He considered them inadequate in the face of the escalating economic crisis but still supported some of Roosevelt&#x27;s programs in the Senate, explaining: &quot;Whenever this administration has gone to the left I have voted with it, and whenever it has gone to the right I have voted against it.&quot;

Long opposed the National Recovery Act, claiming it favored industrialists. In an attempt to prevent its passage, Long held a lone filibuster, speaking for 15 hours and 30 minutes, the second longest filibuster at the time. He also criticized Social Security, calling it inadequate and expressing his concerns that states would administer it in a way discriminatory to African Americans. In 1933, he was a leader of a three-week Senate filibuster against the Glass banking bill, which he later supported as the Glass–Steagall Act after provisions extended government deposit insurance to state banks as well as national banks.

Roosevelt considered Long a radical demagogue and stated that Long, along with General Douglas MacArthur, &quot;was one of the two most dangerous men in America&quot;. In June 1933, in an effort to undermine Long&#x27;s political dominance, Roosevelt cut him out of consultations on the distribution of federal funds and patronage in Louisiana and placed Long&#x27;s opponents in charge of federal programs in the state. Roosevelt supported a Senate inquiry into the election of Long ally John H. Overton to the Senate in 1932. The Long machine was accused of election fraud and voter intimidation, but the inquiry came up empty, and Overton was seated. To discredit Long and damage his support base, Roosevelt had Long&#x27;s finances investigated by the Internal Revenue Service in 1934. Although they failed to link Long to any illegality, some of his lieutenants were charged with income tax evasion. Roosevelt&#x27;s son, Elliott, would later note that in this instance, his father &quot;may have been the originator of the concept of employing the IRS as a weapon of political retribution&quot;.

===Chaco War and foreign policy===

On May 30, 1934, Long took to the Senate floor to debate the abrogation of the Platt Amendment. But instead of debating the amendment, Long declared his support for Paraguay against Bolivia in the Chaco War. He maintained that U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes had awarded the oil-rich Chaco region to Paraguay in 1878. He attested Standard Oil had corrupted the Bolivian government and organized the war and that Wall Street orchestrated American foreign policy in Latin America. For his speech, Long received praise in Paraguay: after capturing a Bolivian fort in July 1934, they renamed it Fort Long. Long&#x27;s allegations were widely publicized in Latin American newspapers. This drew the concern of the State Department, who believed that Long was damaging the reputation of the United States. Throughout the summer of 1934, they waged a sustained public relations campaign against Long throughout Latin America. This speech and others established Long as one of the most ardent isolationists in the Senate. He further argued that American involvement in the Spanish–American War and the First World War had been deadly mistakes conducted on behalf of Wall Street. Consequently, Long demanded the immediate independence of the Philippines, which the United States had occupied since 1898. He also opposed American entry into the World Court.

===Share Our Wealth===
In March 1933, Long revealed a series of bills collectively known as &quot;the Long plan&quot; to redistribute wealth. Together, they would cap fortunes at $100 million, limit annual income to $1 million, and cap individual inheritances at $5 million.

In a nationwide February 1934 radio broadcast, Long introduced his Share Our Wealth plan. The legislation would use the wealth from the Long plan to guarantee every family a basic household grant of $5,000 and a minimum annual income of one-third of the average family homestead value and income. Long supplemented his plan with proposals for free college and vocational training, veterans&#x27; benefits, federal assistance to farmers, public works projects, greater federal economic regulation, a $30 monthly elderly pension, a month&#x27;s vacation for every worker, a thirty-hour workweek, a $10 billion land reclamation project to end the Dust Bowl, and free medical service and a &quot;war on disease&quot; led by the Mayo brothers. These reforms, Long claimed, would end the Great Depression. The plans were widely criticized and labeled impossible by economists.

With the Senate unwilling to support his proposals, in February 1934 Long formed the Share Our Wealth Society, a national network of local clubs that operated in opposition to the Democratic Party and Roosevelt. By 1935, the society had over 7.5 million members in 27,000 clubs. Long&#x27;s Senate office received an average of 60,000 letters a week, resulting in Long&#x27;s hiring 48 stenographers to type responses. Of the two trucks that delivered mail to the Senate, one was devoted solely to mail for Long. Long&#x27;s newspaper, now renamed &quot;American Progress&quot;, averaged a circulation of 300,000, some issues reaching over 1.5 million. Long drew international attention: English writer H. G. Wells interviewed Long, noting he was &quot;like a Winston Churchill who has never been at Harrow. He abounds in promises.&quot;

Some historians believe that pressure from Share Our Wealth contributed to Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;turn to the left&quot; in the Second New Deal (1935), which consisted of the Social Security Act, the Works Progress Administration, the National Labor Relations Board, Aid to Dependent Children, and the Wealth Tax Act of 1935. Roosevelt reportedly admitted in private to trying to &quot;steal Long&#x27;s thunder&quot;.

===Continued control over Louisiana===
Long continued to maintain effective control of Louisiana while he was a senator, blurring the boundary between federal and state politics. Long chose his childhood friend, Oscar K. Allen, to succeed King in the January 1932 election. With the support of Long&#x27;s voter base, Allen won easily, permitting Long to resign as governor and take his seat in the U.S. Senate in January 1932. Allen, widely viewed as a puppet, dutifully enacted Long&#x27;s policies. When Long visited Louisiana, Allen would relinquish his office for the Senator, working instead at his receptionist&#x27;s desk. Though he had no constitutional authority, Long continued to draft and press bills through the Louisiana State Legislature. One of the laws passed was what Long called &quot;a tax on lying&quot;—a 2 percent tax on newspaper advertising revenue.

In 1934, Long and James A. Noe, an independent oilman and member of the Louisiana State Senate from Ouachita Parish, formed the controversial Win or Lose Oil Company. The firm was established to obtain leases on state-owned lands so that its directors might collect bonuses and sublease the mineral rights to the major oil companies. Although ruled legal, these activities were done in secret, and the stockholders were unknown to the public. Long made a profit on the bonuses and the resale of those state leases and used the funds primarily for political purposes.

==1935: Final year==

===1936 presidential ambitions===
Popular support for Long&#x27;s Share Our Wealth program raised the possibility of a 1936 presidential bid against incumbent Franklin D. Roosevelt. When questioned by the press, Long gave conflicting answers on his plans for 1936. Long&#x27;s son Russell believed his father would have run on a third-party ticket. This is evidenced by Long&#x27;s writing of a speculative book, &quot;My First Days in the White House&quot;, which laid out his plans for the presidency after the 1936 election.

In spring 1935, Long undertook a national speaking tour and regular radio appearances, attracting large crowds and increasing his stature. At a well-attended Long rally in Philadelphia, a former mayor told the press, &quot;There are 250,000 Long votes&quot; in this city. Regarding Roosevelt, Long boasted to the &quot;New York Times&quot;″ Arthur Krock: &quot;He&#x27;s scared of me. I can out-promise him, and he knows it.&quot;

As the 1936 election approached, the Roosevelt Administration grew increasingly concerned by Long&#x27;s popularity. Democratic National Committee chairman James Farley commissioned a secret poll in early 1935. Farley&#x27;s poll revealed that if Long ran on a third-party ticket, he would win about four million votes, 10% of the electorate. In a memo to Roosevelt, Farley expressed his concern that Long could split the vote, allowing the Republican nominee to win. Diplomat Edward M. House warned Roosevelt, &quot;many people believe that he can do to your administration what Theodore Roosevelt did to the Taft Administration in &#x27;12&quot;. Many, including Hair, Roosevelt, and Williams speculated that Long expected to lose in 1936, allowing the Republicans to take the White House. They believed the Republicans would worsen the Great Depression, deepening Long&#x27;s appeal. According to Roosevelt, &quot;That would bring the country to such a state by 1940 that Long thinks he would be made dictator.&quot;

===Increased tensions in Louisiana===

By 1935, Long&#x27;s consolidation of power led to talk of armed opposition from his enemies in Louisiana. Opponents increasingly invoked the memory of the Battle of Liberty Place (1874), in which the White League staged an uprising against Louisiana&#x27;s Reconstruction-era government. In January 1935, an anti-Long paramilitary organization called the Square Deal Association was formed. Its members included former governors John M. Parker and Ruffin Pleasant and New Orleans Mayor T. Semmes Walmsley. Standard Oil threatened to leave the state when Long finally passed the five-cent-per-barrel oil tax for which he had been impeached in 1929. Concerned Standard Oil employees formed a Square Deal association in Baton Rouge, organizing themselves in militia companies and demanding &quot;direct action&quot;.

On January 25, 1935, these Square Dealers, now armed, seized the East Baton Rouge Parish courthouse. Long had Governor Allen execute emergency measures in Baton Rouge: he called in the National Guard, declared martial law, banned public gatherings of two or more persons, and forbade the publication of criticism of state officials. The Square Dealers left the courthouse, but there was a brief armed skirmish at the Baton Rouge Airport. Tear gas and live ammunition were fired; one person was wounded, but there were no fatalities. At a legal hearing, an alleged spy within the Square Dealers testified they were conspiring to assassinate Long.

In summer 1935, Long called two special legislative sessions in Louisiana; bills were passed in rapid-fire succession without being read or discussed. The new laws further centralized Long&#x27;s control over the state by creating new Long-appointed state agencies: a state bond and tax board holding sole authority to approve loans to local governments, a new state printing board which could withhold &quot;official printer&quot; status from uncooperative newspapers, a new board of election supervisors which would appoint all poll watchers, and a State Board of Censors. They stripped away the remaining powers of the mayor of New Orleans. Long boasted he had &quot;taken over every board and commission in New Orleans except the Community Chest and the Red Cross&quot;. A September 7 special session passed 42 bills. The most extreme, likely aimed at Roosevelt and his federal agents, authorized Louisiana to fine and imprison anyone who infringed on the powers reserved to the state in the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

===Assassination===
On September 8, 1935, Long traveled to the State Capitol to pass a bill that would gerrymander the district of an opponent, Judge Benjamin Pavy, who had held his position for 28 years. At 9:20 p.m., just after passage of the bill effectively removing Pavy, the judge&#x27;s son-in-law, Carl Weiss, approached Long, and, according to the generally accepted version of events, fired a single shot with a handgun from four feet (1.2 m) away, striking Long in the torso. Long&#x27;s bodyguards, nicknamed the &quot;Cossacks&quot; or &quot;skullcrushers&quot;, then fired at Weiss with their pistols, killing him. An autopsy found Weiss had been shot at least 60 times. Long ran down a flight of stairs and across the capitol grounds, hailing a car to take him to Our Lady of the Lake Hospital. He was rushed to the operating room where surgery closed perforations in his intestines but failed to stop internal bleeding. Long died at 4:10 a.m. on September 10, 31 hours after being shot. According to different sources, his last words were either &quot;I wonder what will happen to my poor university boys&quot; or &quot;God, don&#x27;t let me die. I have so much to do.&quot;

Over 200,000 people traveled to Baton Rouge to attend Long&#x27;s September 12 funeral. His remains were buried on the grounds of the Capitol; a statue depicting Long was constructed on his grave. Although Long&#x27;s allies alleged he was assassinated by political opponents, a federal probe found no evidence of conspiracy. Long&#x27;s death brought relief to the Roosevelt Administration, which would win in a landslide in the 1936 election. Farley publicly admitted his apprehension of campaigning against Long: &quot;I always laughed Huey off, but I did not feel that way about him.&quot; Roosevelt&#x27;s close economic advisor Rexford Tugwell wrote that, &quot;When he was gone it seemed that a beneficent peace had fallen on the land. Father Coughlin, Reno, Townsend, et al., were after all pygmies compared with Huey. He had been a major phenomenon.&quot; Tugwell also said that Roosevelt regarded Long&#x27;s assassination as a &quot;providential occurrence&quot;.

Evidence later surfaced that suggests Long was accidentally shot by his bodyguards. Proponents of this theory assert Long was caught in the crossfire as his bodyguards shot Weiss, and a bullet that ricocheted off the marble walls hit him.

===Politics===
Long&#x27;s assassination may have contributed to his reputation as a legendary figure in parts of Louisiana. In 1938, Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal encountered rural children who not only insisted Long was alive, but that he was president. Although no longer governing, Long&#x27;s policies continued to be enacted in Louisiana by his political machine, which supported Roosevelt&#x27;s re-election to prevent further investigation into their finances. The machine remained a powerful force in state politics until the 1960 elections. Within the Louisiana Democratic Party, Long set in motion two durable factions—&quot;pro-Long&quot; and &quot;anti-Long&quot;—which diverged meaningfully in terms of policies and voter support. For decades after his death, Long&#x27;s political style inspired imitation among Louisiana politicians who borrowed his rhetoric and promises of social programs.

After Long&#x27;s death, a family dynasty emerged: his brother Earl was elected lieutenant-governor in 1936 and governor in 1948 and 1956. Long&#x27;s widow, Rose Long, replaced him in the Senate, and his son, Russell, was a U.S. senator from 1948 to 1987. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Russell shaped the nation&#x27;s tax laws, advocating low business taxes and passing legislation beneficial to the poor like the Earned Income Credit. Other relatives, including George, Gillis, and Speedy, have represented Louisiana in Congress.

Huey P. Newton, co-founder of the Black Panther Party, was named after Long.

===Historical reputation===
Academics and historians have found difficulty categorizing Long and his ideology. His platform has been compared to ideologies ranging from McCarthyism to European Fascism and Stalinism. When asked about his own philosophy, Long simply replied: &quot;Oh, hell, say that I&#x27;m &quot;sui generis&quot; and let it go at that.&quot; In a 1981 &quot;New York Times&quot;, Robert Penn Warren wrote of Long:My guess is that he was a remarkable set of contradictions, still baffling to biographers. But I had a great interest in what Huey did in his world, and a greater interest in Huey as a focus of myth. Without this gift for attracting myth he would not have been the power he was, for good and evil. And this gift was fused, indissolubly, with his dramatic sense, with his varying roles and perhaps, ultimately, with the atmosphere of violence which he generated.

A majority of academics, biographers, and writers who have examined Long view him negatively, typically as a demagogue or dictator. Reinhard H. Luthin said that he was the epitome of an American demagogue. David Kennedy wrote that Long&#x27;s regime in Louisiana was &quot;the closest thing to a dictatorship that America has ever known&quot;. Journalist Hodding Carter described him as &quot;the first true dictator out of the soil of America&quot; and his movement the &quot;success of fascism in one American state&quot;. Peter Viereck categorized Long&#x27;s movement as &quot;chauvinist thought control&quot;; Victor Ferkiss called it &quot;incipient fascism&quot;.

One of the few biographers to praise Long was T. Harry Williams, who classified Long&#x27;s ideas as neo-populist. He labeled Long a democratic &quot;mass leader&quot;, rather than a demagogue. Besides Williams, intellectual Gore Vidal expressed admiration for Long, even naming him as his favorite contemporary U.S. politician. Long biographer Thomas O. Harris espoused a more nuanced view of Long: &quot;neither saint nor devil, he was a complex and heterogenous mixture of good and bad, genius and craft, hypocrisy and candor, buffoonery and seriousness&quot;.

===Media===
In popular culture, Long has served as a template for multiple dictatorial politicians in novels. Notable works include Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s novel &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot; (1935), Robert Penn Warren&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; (1946), and Adria Locke Langley&#x27;s 1945 novel &quot;A Lion Is in the Streets&quot;. The latter two were adapted into films. As well as two television docudramas, Long was the subject of a 1985 Ken Burns-directed documentary. In music, Randy Newman featured Long in two songs on the 1974 album &quot;Good Old Boys&quot;. 

Long has been the subject of dozens of biographies and academic texts. In fact, more has been written about Long than any other Louisianan. Most notable is the 1969 biography &quot;Huey Long&quot; by Williams, which won both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. Alan Brinkley won the National Book Award in 1983 for &quot;Voices of Protest&quot;, a study of Long, Coughlin, and populist opposition to Roosevelt.

<doc id="102448" wikidata="Q312723" url="?curid=102448" title="El Mahalla El Kubra">
<text>El Mahalla El Kubra (, , , ) – commonly shortened to &quot; – is the largest city of the Gharbia Governorate and in the Nile Delta, with a population of 535,278 as of 2012. It is a large industrial and agricultural city in Egypt, located in the middle of the Nile Delta on the western bank of the Damietta Branch tributary. The city is known for its textile industry, and hosts the Misr Spinning and Weaving Company which employs around 27,000 people.

==Etymology==
El Mahalla El Kubra consists of two words: El Mahalla in Arabic means &quot;district&quot; or &quot;encampment&quot;,&quot; El Kubra means &quot;great&quot;. Hence the title collectively means &quot;The Great Encampment&quot;. The name is probably a rough translation of its Coptic Egyptian equivalent ti-Šairi (&quot;).&quot;

==History==
In the Chronicle of John of Nikiu el-Mahalla is also given a name Didouseya, which could be equated with &quot;Theodosiou&quot; (). It is given as &quot;Theodosiou Nixis&quot; () by Daressy, but it&#x27;s rather an equation of two nearby towns (Theodosiou and Nixis, modern Nawasa ()), common for Coptic Scalae, rather than a compound name. The modern area Suq al-Laban is located on Didouseya Hill.

The city was also known as Mahalla Daqla (), where second word could be a corruption of Dakahla.

An ancient village &quot;Sandafa&quot; (, ) was located south of el-Mahalla. North of it was a village &quot;Hureyn Baharmis&quot; (), the name of which suggests that it was an ancient river-port (), whose namesake is mentioned in Demotic sources (). In 1844 the city absorbed both villages.

El Mahalla El Kubra was designated as the capital of Gharbia Governorate in 1320 by Ibn Qalawun, before it was relocated to Tanta in 1836.

===2006–11 protests===
Over 15,000 protesters clashed with police in El Mahalla in 2006, following the publication of a cartoon mocking Islam in Denmark.

Later in 2006 textile workers struck to protest market reforms, demanding better living conditions.

Beginning in April 2008 the city held mass demonstrations protesting the election results of President Hosni Mubarak, claiming election fraud and demanding better wages. Security forces were ordered to crack down on the dissidents, and in May they killed two or three in the city and injured dozens. Images of protesters in Mahalla overturning billboards of Mubarak were viewed by some Egyptians as a turning point in Egyptian politics, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. &quot;The Observer&quot; has written that protests in El Mahalla from 2006 to 2011 spearheaded larger political changes throughout Egypt. A Facebook group established by 28-year-old engineer Ahmad Maher to support striking textile workers in El Mahalla gained 70,000 followers and helped organize support for the strikers nationally.

In 2011, protests in Mahalla contributed to the collapse of the Mubarak dictatorship.

===2012 protests and declaration of autonomy===
On 15 July 2012, 25,000 workers from El Mahalla El Kubra&#x27;s Misr Spinning and Weaving Company went on strike, demanding increased profit sharing, better retirement benefits and a replacement of the management. The Misr workers were joined by workers from seven other textile factories in the region, and strikes also broke out among doctors and health workers, university workers, and ceramics workers in other parts of Egypt.

Clashes between protesters supporting or opposing the Muslim Brotherhood on November 28 left over 100 people injured. On December 7, the city declared itself autonomous from Egypt, as workers and students, declaring themselves independent from the &quot;Muslim Brotherhood State&quot;, cut rail lines and blocked entrances to the city. Protesters stormed the city council and announced their intentions to replace it with a revolutionary council.

==Geography==
===Climate===
The Köppen–Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh).

==Buildings and structures==
El Mahalla El Kubra contains Misr Spinning and Weaving Company, the largest cotton manufacturing company in Egypt, and the clock of Big Ben is made by this company.

==Economy==
El Mahalla El Kubra is home to the largest public sector Egyptian textile company, the Misr Spinning and Weaving Company, employing over 27,000 workers.

==Sport==
The city has two football teams: Ghazl Al-Mehalla and Baladeyet Al-Mahalla.

==Notable people==

* Mahmoud Mokhtar, a legendary Egyptian sculptor
* Salah Zulfikar, legendary actor
* Cyril of Alexandria, Patriarch of Alexandria from 412 to 444

<doc id="102451" wikidata="Q176212" url="?curid=102451" title="Tetrode">
<text>A tetrode is a vacuum tube (called &quot;valve&quot; in British English) having four active electrodes. The four electrodes in order from the centre are: a thermionic cathode, first and second grids, and a plate (called &quot;anode&quot; in British English). There are several varieties of tetrodes, the most common being the screen-grid tube and the beam tetrode. In screen-grid tubes and beam tetrodes, the first grid is the control grid and the second grid is the screen grid. In other tetrodes one of the grids is a control grid, while the other may have a variety of functions.

The tetrode was developed in the 1920s by adding an additional grid to the first amplifying vacuum tube, the triode, to correct limitations of the triode. During the period 1913 to 1927, three distinct types of tetrode valves appeared. All had a normal control grid whose function was to act as a primary control for current passing through the tube, but they differed according to the intended function of the other grid. In order of historical appearance these are: the space-charge grid tube, the bi-grid valve, and the screen-grid tube. The last of these appeared in two distinct variants with different areas of application: the screen-grid valve proper, which was used for medium-frequency, small signal amplification, and the beam tetrode which appeared later, and was used for audio or radio-frequency power amplification. The former was quickly superseded by the rf pentode, while the latter was initially developed as an alternative to the pentode as an audio power amplifying device. The beam tetrode was also developed as a high power radio transmitting tube.

Tetrodes were widely used in many consumer electronic devices such as radios, televisions, and audio systems until transistors replaced valves in the 1960s and 70s. Beam tetrodes have remained in use until quite recently in power applications such as audio amplifiers and radio transmitters.

==How it works==

The tetrode functions in a similar way to the triode, from which it was developed. A current through the heater or filament heats the cathode, which causes it to emit electrons by thermionic emission. A positive voltage is applied between the plate and cathode, causing a flow of electrons from the cathode to plate through the two grids. A varying voltage applied to the control grid can control this current, causing variations in the plate current. With a resistive or other load in the plate circuit, the varying current will result in a varying voltage at the plate. With proper biasing, this voltage will be an amplified (but inverted) version of the AC voltage applied to the control grid, providing voltage gain. In the tetrode, the function of the other grid varies according to the type of tetrode; this is discussed below.

==Space charge grid tube==
The space charge grid tube was the first type of tetrode to appear. In the course of his research into the action of the &quot;audion&quot; triode tube invented by Edwin Howard Armstrong and Lee de Forest, Irving Langmuir found that the action of the heated thermionic cathode was to create a space charge, or cloud of electrons, around the cathode. &lt;confused: de Forest invented the triode, Armstrong gave a defensible description&gt;. This cloud acted as a virtual cathode. With low applied anode voltage, many of the electrons in the space charge returned to the cathode, and did not contribute to the anode current; only those at its outer limit would be affected by the electric field due to the anode, and would be accelerated towards it. However, if a grid bearing a low positive applied potential (about 10V) were inserted between the cathode and the control grid, the space charge could be made to extend further away from the cathode. This had two advantageous effects, both related to the influence of the electric fields of the other electrodes (anode and control grid) on the electrons of the space charge. First, a significant increase in anode current could be achieved with low anode voltage; the valve could be made to work well with lower applied anode voltage. Second, the transconductance (rate of change of anode current with respect to control grid voltage) of the tube was increased. The latter effect was particularly important since it increased the voltage gain available from the valve.

Space-charge valves remained useful devices throughout the valve era, and were used in applications such as car radios operating directly from a 12V supply, where only a low anode voltage was available. The same principle was applied to other types of multi-grid tubes such as pentodes. As an example, the Sylvania 12K5 is described as &quot;a tetrode designed for space-charge operation. It is intended for service as a power amplifier driver where the potentials are obtained directly from a 12V automobile battery.&quot; The space-charge grid was operated at +12V, the same as the anode supply voltage.

Another important application of the space-charge tetrode was as an electrometer tube for detecting and measuring extremely small currents. For example, the General Electric FP54 was described as a &quot;space-charge grid tube ... designed to have a very high input impedance and a very low grid current. It is designed particularly for amplification of direct currents smaller than about 10 amperes, and has been found capable of measuring currents as small as 5 x 10 amperes. It has a current amplification factor of 250,000, and operates with an anode voltage of 12V, and space-charge grid voltage of +4V.&quot;
 The mechanism by which the space-charge grid lowers control-grid current in an electrometer tetrode is that it prevents positive ions originating in the cathode from reaching the control grid.

Note that when a space-charge grid is added to a triode, the first grid in the resulting tetrode is the space-charge grid, and the second grid is the control grid.

==Bi-grid valve==
In the bi-grid type of tetrode, both grids are intended to carry electrical signals, so both are control grids. The first example to appear in Britain was the Marconi-Osram FE1, which was designed by H. J. Round, and became available in 1920. The tube was intended to be used in a reflex circuit (for example the single-valve ship receiver Type 91) where the same valve performed the combined functions of RF amplifier, AF amplifier, and diode detector. The RF signal was applied to one control grid, and the AF signal to the other. This type of tetrode was used in many imaginative ways in the period before the appearance of the screen-grid valve revolutionised receiver design.
One application is shown in the illustration. This is recognisable as an AM telephony transmitter in which the second grid and the anode form a power oscillator, and the first grid acts as a modulating electrode. The anode current in the valve, and hence the RF output amplitude, is modulated by the voltage on G1, which is derived from a carbon microphone.

A tube of this type could also be used as a direct conversion CW (radiotelegraphy) receiver. Here the valve oscillates as a consequence of coupling between the first grid and the anode, while the second grid is coupled to the antenna. The AF beat frequency is audible in the headphones. The valve acts as a self-oscillating product detector.
Another, very similar application of the bi-grid valve was as a self oscillating frequency mixer in early superhet receivers 
One control grid carried the incoming RF signal, while the other was connected into an oscillator circuit which generated the local oscillation within the same valve. Since the anode current of the bi-grid valve was proportional both to the signal on the first grid, and also to the oscillator voltage on the second grid, the required multiplication of the two signals was achieved, and the intermediate frequency signal was selected by a tuned circuit connected to the anode. In each of these applications, the bi-grid tetrode acted as an unbalanced analogue multiplier in which the plate current, in addition to passing both input signals includes the product of the two signals applied to the grids.

==The superheterodyne receiver==

The principle of the modern superheterodyne (or &quot;superhet&quot;) receiver (originally named the &quot;super-sonic heterodyne&quot; receiver, because the intermediate frequency was at an ultrasonic frequency) was invented in France by Lucien Levy in 1917 (p 66), though credit is usually also given to Edwin Armstrong. The original reason for the invention of the superhet was that before the appearance of the screen-grid valve, amplifying valves, then triodes, had difficulty amplifying radio frequencies (i.e. frequencies much above 100 kHz) due to the Miller effect. In the superheterodyne design, rather than amplifying the incoming radio signal, it was first mixed with a constant RF oscillator (the so-called local oscillator) to produce a heterodyne of typically 30 kHz. This intermediate frequency (IF) signal had an identical envelope as the incoming signal but a much lower carrier frequency, so it could be efficiently amplified using triodes. When detected, the original modulation of the higher frequency radio signal is obtained. A somewhat complicated technique, it went out of favor when screen-grid tetrodes made tuned radio frequency (TRF) receivers practical. However the superheterodyne principle resurfaced in the early 1930s when their other advantages, such as greater selectivity became appreciated, and almost all modern receivers operate on this principle but with a higher IF frequency (sometimes higher than the original RF) with amplifiers (such as the tetrode) having surpassed the triode&#x27;s limitation in amplifying high (radio) frequency signals.

The superheterodyne concept could be implemented using a valve as the local oscillator and a separate valve as the mixer which takes the antenna signal and the local oscillator as input signals. But for economy, those two functions could also be combined in a single bi-grid tetrode which would both oscillate and frequency-mix the RF signal from the antenna. In later years this was similarly accomplished by the pentagrid converter tube, a similar two-input amplifying/oscillating valve, but which (like pentode tubes) incorporated a suppressor grid and in this case two screen grids in order to electrostatically isolate the plate and both signal grids from each other. In today&#x27;s receivers, based on inexpensive semiconductor technology (transistors), there is no cost benefit in combining the two functions in one active device.

==Screen grid valve==

The screen grid tube provides much smaller control grid to anode capacitance and much greater amplification factor than a triode. Radio frequency amplifier circuits using triodes were prone to oscillation due to the grid to anode capacitance of the triode. In the screen grid tube, a grid referred to as the &quot;screen grid&quot;, &quot;shield grid&quot; or sometimes &quot;accelerating grid&quot; is inserted between the control grid and the anode. The screen grid provides an electrostatic shield between the control grid and the anode, reducing the capacitance between them to a very small amount. To reduce the influence of the anode&#x27;s electric field on the cathode space charge and on the control grid, during 1915 - 1916 physicist Walter H. Schottky developed the first tubes having a grid positioned between the anode and the control grid to provide an electrostatic shield. Schottky patented these screen grid tubes in Germany in 1916 and in the U.S. in 1919. These tubes were produced in Germany and known as Siemens-Schottky tubes. In Japan, Hiroshi Ando patented improvements to the construction of the screen grid in 1919. During the latter half of the 1920s, Neal H. Williams and Albert Hull at General Electric, H. J. Round at MOV and Bernard Tellegen at Phillips developed improved screen grid tubes. These improved screen grid tubes were first marketed in 1927.

Feedback through the anode to grid capacitance (Miller effect) of the triode could cause oscillation, especially when both anode and grid were connected to tuned resonant circuits as is usual in a radio frequency (RF) amplifier. For frequencies above about 100 kHz, neutralizing circuitry was necessary. A typical triode used for small-signal amplification had a grid to anode capacitance of 8 pF, while the corresponding figure for a typical screen grid valve was 0.025 pF. Neutralizing circuits were not required for a well designed screen grid tube RF amplifier stage.

The screen grid is connected to a positive DC voltage and at AC ground as insured by a bypass capacitor to ground. The useful region of operation of the screen grid tube as an amplifier is limited to anode voltages greater than the screen grid voltage. At anode voltages greater than the screen grid voltage some electrons from the cathode will hit the screen grid, producing screen current, but most will pass through the open spaces of the screen and continue to the anode. As the anode voltage approaches and falls below that of the screen grid, screen current will increase as shown in the plate characteristics image.

An additional advantage of the screen grid became apparent when it was added. The anode current becomes almost completely independent of the anode voltage, as long as the anode voltage is greater than the screen voltage. This corresponds to a very high anode dynamic resistance, thus allowing for a much larger voltage gain when the anode load impedance is large. The anode current is controlled by the control grid and screen grid voltages. Consequently, tetrodes are mainly characterized by their transconductance (change in anode current relative to control grid voltage) whereas triodes are characterized by their amplification factor (&quot;mu&quot;), their maximum possible voltage gain. At the time of the introduction of screen grid valves, a typical triode used in radio receivers had an anode dynamic resistance of 20 kΩ or less while the corresponding figure for a typical screen grid valve was 500 kΩ. A typical triode medium wave RF amplifier stage produced voltage gain of around 14, but screen grid tube RF amplifier stages produced voltage gains of 30 to 60.
To take full advantage of the very low grid-anode capacitance, the shielding between anode and grid circuits was observed in the construction of the radio. The S625 valve was mounted in a grounded, plane, metal shield aligned to correspond with the position of the internal screen grid. The input, or control-grid circuit was on one side of the shield, while the anode, or output circuit was on the other. In the receiver shown using S23 tubes, each entire stage of the 2-stage rf amplifier, as well as the tuned detector stage, was enclosed in an individual large metallic box for electrostatic shielding. These boxes have been removed in the illustration, but the up-turned edges of the bases of the boxes can be seen.

Thus screen grid valves permitted better radio frequency amplification in the medium and high frequency ranges in radio equipment. They were commonly used in the design of radio-frequency amplification stage(s) of radio receivers from late 1927 through 1931, then were superseded by the pentode tube.

==Anode characteristic of screen-grid valves==
The reason for the limited applicability of the screen-grid valve, and its rapid replacement by the RF pentode (introduced around 1930) was the peculiar anode characteristic (i.e. variation of anode current with respect to anode voltage) of the former type of tube.

In normal applications, the anode voltage was about 150 V, while that of the screen-grid was about 60 V (Thrower p 183). As the screen grid is positive with respect to the cathode, it collects a certain fraction (perhaps a quarter) of the electrons which would otherwise pass from the grid region to the anode. This causes current to flow in the screen grid circuit. Usually, the screen current due to this cause is small, and of little interest. However, if the anode voltage should be below that of the screen, the screen grid can also collect secondary electrons ejected from the anode by the impact of the energetic primary electrons. Both effects tend to reduce the anode current. If the anode voltage is increased from a low value, with the screen grid at its normal operating voltage (60V, say) the anode current initially increases rapidly because more of those electrons which pass through the screen-grid are collected by the anode rather than passing back to the screen grid. This part of the tetrode anode characteristic resembles the corresponding part of that of a triode or pentode. However, when the anode voltage is increased further, the electrons arriving at the anode have sufficient energy to cause copious secondary emission, and many of these secondary electrons will be captured by the screen, which is at a higher positive voltage than the anode. This causes the anode current to fall rather than increase when the anode voltage is increased. In some cases the anode current can actually become negative (current flows out of the anode); this is possible since each primary electron may produce more than one secondary. Falling positive anode current accompanied by rising anode voltage gives the anode characteristic a region of negative slope, and this corresponds to a negative resistance which can cause instability in certain circuits. In a higher range of anode voltage, the anode voltage sufficiently exceeds that of the screen for an increasing proportion of the secondary electrons to be attracted back to the anode, so the anode current increases once more, and the slope of the anode characteristic becomes positive again. In a yet higher range of anode voltages, the anode current becomes substantially constant, since all of the secondary electrons now return to the anode, and the main control of current through the tube is the voltage of the control grid. This is the normal operating mode of the tube.
The anode characteristic of a screen-grid valve is thus quite unlike that of a triode. Where the anode voltage is less than that of the screen grid, there is a distinctive negative resistance characteristic, called the &quot;dynatron region&quot; or &quot;tetrode kink&quot;. The approximately constant-current region of low slope at anode voltages greater than the screen grid voltage is also markedly different from that of the triode, and provides the useful region of operation of the screen grid tube as an amplifier. The low slope is highly desirable, since it greatly enhances the voltage gain which the device can produce. Early screen-grid valves had amplification factors (i.e. the product of transconductance and anode slope resistance, R) fifty times or more greater than that of comparable triode. The high anode resistance in the normal operating range is a consequence of the electrostatic shielding action of the screen grid, since it prevents the electric field due to the anode from penetrating to the control grid region, where it might otherwise influence the passage of electrons, increasing the electron current when the anode voltage is high, reducing it when low. 
The negative resistance operating region of the tetrode is exploited in the dynatron oscillator, which is an example of a negative resistance oscillator.(Eastman, p431)

==Beam tetrode==
 

The beam tetrode eliminates the dynatron region or tetrode kink of the screen grid tube by utilizing partially collimated electron beams to develop a dense low potential space charge region between the screen grid and anode that returns anode secondary emission electrons to the anode. The anode characteristic of the beam tetrode is less rounded at lower anode voltages than the anode characteristic of the power pentode, resulting in greater power output and less third harmonic distortion with the same anode supply voltage. Beam tetrodes are usually used for power amplification, from audio frequency to radio frequency. The beam tetrode was patented in Britain in 1933 by three EMI engineers, Isaac Shoenberg, Cabot Bull and Sidney Rodda.

==Critical-distance tetrode==
The High Vacuum Valve company of London, England (Hivac) introduced a line of power output tetrodes in August 1935 that utilized J. H. Owen Harries&#x27; &quot;critical distance&quot; effect to eliminate the dynatron region of the anode voltage - anode current characteristic. The critical distance tubes utilized space charge return of anode secondary electrons to the anode. Distinctive physical characteristics of the critical distance tetrode were large screen grid to anode distance and elliptical grid structure. The large screen grid to anode distance facilitated formation of the low potential space charge to return anode secondary electrons to the anode when the anode potential was less than that of the screen grid. The elliptical grids permitted the control grid support rods to be farther away from the cathode so as to reduce their effect on amplification factor with control grid voltage. At zero and negative control grid voltage, the control grid support rods and control grid formed the electron stream from the cathode into two major regions of space current, 180 degrees apart, directed toward two wide sectors of the anode circumference. These features resulted in somewhat greater output power and lower distortion than a comparable power pentode, due to saturation occurring at lower anode voltage and increased curvature (smaller radius) of the anode voltage - anode current characteristic at low anode voltages.
A range of tetrodes of this type were introduced, aimed at the domestic receiver market, some having filaments rated for two volts direct current, intended for low-power battery-operated sets; others having indirectly heated cathodes with heaters rated for four volts or higher for mains operation. Output power ratings ranged from 0.5 watts to 11.5 watts. Confusingly, several of these new valves bore the same type number as existing pentodes with almost identical characteristics. Examples include Y220 (0.5W, 2V filament), AC/Y (3W, 4V heater), AC/Q (11.5W, 4V heater).

<text>A one-party state, single-party state, one-party system or single-party system is a governance structure in which only a single political party controls the ruling system. In a one-party state, all opposition parties are either outlawed or enjoy limited and controlled participation in elections. The term &quot;&quot;de facto&quot; one-party state&quot; is sometimes used to describe a dominant-party system that, unlike a one-party state, allows (at least nominally) multiparty elections, but the existing practices or balance of political power effectively prevent the opposition from winning power.

Membership in the ruling party tends to be relatively small compared to the population. With such a small winning coalition, leaders in one-party states usually lack the incentive to care about the well-being of citizens. Rather, they give out private goods to fellow elites to ensure continued support. One-party, compared to dominant-party dictatorships, structure themselves unlike democracies. They also turn into democracies at a lower rate than dominant-party dictatorships. While one-party states prohibit opposition parties, some allow for elections at the smallest local level. One-party states lack any legitimate competition. Therefore, they place elites and sympathetic candidates in key administrative races. For example, the Chinese Communist Party exercises political control by infiltrating village administrations. They view these positions as crucial for gathering information on the population and maintaining a presence in the far reaches of their borders.

One-party states recognize the trade-off between election victory and gathering valuable data. To account for this, the regimes have been observed placing local nobility in easy-to-win races. One-party states have also been observed using elections to ensure that only the most popular elites get chosen to office. They also gather data from elections to indicate if a local official is performing poorly in the eyes of the residents. This gives locals the opportunity to monitor local officials and communicate satisfaction with the local government. Throughout the country, members of the one party hold key political positions. In doing so, the party avoids committing outright fraud and rather sustains their power at the local level with strategic appointment of elites. Data on one-party regimes can be difficult to gather given their lack of transparency.

==Current one-party states==
As of 2025, the following countries are legally constituted as one-party states:
==&quot;De facto&quot; one-party states==

A &quot;de facto&quot; one-party system is one that, while not officially linking a single political party to governmental power, utilizes some means of political manipulation to ensure only one party stays in power. Many different countries have been claimed to be &quot;de facto&quot; one-party states, with differing levels of agreement between scholars, although most agree that the African continent is marked by this political system. Below are just a few examples of governments that have been claimed to have single party rule due to political manipulation.

<doc id="102467" wikidata="Q311263" url="?curid=102467" title="John Hughes (filmmaker)">
<text>John Wilden Hughes Jr. (February 18, 1950 – August 6, 2009) was an American filmmaker, producer, and screenwriter. He began his career in 1970 as an author of humorous essays and stories for the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine. He went on in Hollywood to write, produce, and direct some of the most successful live-action comedy films of the 1980s and 1990s. He directed, wrote or produced such films as &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;, &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;, &quot;Weird Science&quot;, &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles&quot;, &quot;Curly Sue&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s Having a Baby&quot;, and &quot;Uncle Buck&quot;, and wrote the films &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot;, &quot;Mr. Mom&quot;, &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s European Vacation&quot;, &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;, &quot;The Great Outdoors&quot;, &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot;, &quot;Home Alone&quot;, &quot;Dutch&quot;, and &quot;Beethoven&quot;.

Most of Hughes&#x27;s works were set in Chicago at the fictional Shermer High School and were coming-of-age teen comedy films. Many of his most enduring characters from these years were written for Molly Ringwald. While out on a walk one morning in New York City in the summer of 2009, Hughes suffered a fatal heart attack. After his death, his legacy was honored by many, including at the 82nd Academy Awards by actors he had worked with such as Ringwald, Matthew Broderick, Anthony Michael Hall, Chevy Chase, and Macaulay Culkin among others. Actors whose careers Hughes helped launch include Michael Keaton, Hall, Bill Paxton, Broderick, Culkin, and members of the Brat Pack group.

== Early life and education ==
Hughes was born on February 18, 1950, in Lansing, Michigan, to Marion Crawford, who volunteered in charity work, and John Hughes Sr., who worked in sales. He was the only boy, and had three sisters. He spent the first twelve years of his life in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, where he was a fan of Detroit Red Wings right winger Gordie Howe. One of Howe&#x27;s #9 jerseys, sent by Howe himself, was later prominently featured in Hughes&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. Hughes described himself as &quot;kind of quiet&quot;:

In 1963, Hughes&#x27;s family moved to Northbrook, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. There, his father found work selling roofing materials. Hughes attended Grove Middle School, later going on to Glenbrook North High School, which gave him inspiration for the films that eventually made his reputation. He met Nancy Ludwig, a cheerleader and his future wife, in high school. As a teenager, Hughes turned to movies as an escape. According to childhood friend Jackson Peterson, &quot;His mom and dad criticized him a lot (...) She [Marion] would be critical of what John would want to do&quot;. Hughes was a fan of the Beatles, and allegedly knew a lot about movies and the Rat Pack.

==Career==
=== 1970–1981: Rise to prominence ===
After dropping out of the University of Arizona, Hughes began selling jokes to well-established performers such as Rodney Dangerfield and Joan Rivers. Hughes used his jokes to get an entry-level job at Needham, Harper &amp; Steers as an advertising copywriter in Chicago in 1970 and later in 1974 at Leo Burnett Worldwide. During this period, he created what became the famous Edge &quot;Credit Card Shaving Test&quot; ad campaign.

Hughes&#x27;s work on the Virginia Slims account frequently took him to the Philip Morris headquarters in New York City, which allowed him to visit the offices of &quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine. Soon thereafter, Hughes became a regular contributor; editor P. J. O&#x27;Rourke recalled that &quot;John wrote so fast and so well that it was hard for a monthly magazine to keep up with him.&quot; One of Hughes&#x27;s first stories, inspired by his family trips as a child, was &quot;Vacation &#x27;58&quot;, later to become the basis for the film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot;. Among his other contributions to the &quot;Lampoon&quot;, the April Fools&#x27; Day stories &quot;My Penis&quot; and &quot;My Vagina&quot; gave an early indication of Hughes&#x27;s ear for the particular rhythm of teenspeak, as well as for the various indignities of teenage life in general.

=== 1982–1986: Breakthrough and teen films ===
His first credited screenplay, &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Class Reunion&quot;, was written while he was still on staff at the magazine. The resulting film became the second disastrous attempt by the flagship to duplicate the runaway success of &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;. Hughes&#x27;s next screenplay for the imprint, however, &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot;, would become a major hit in 1983. This, along with the success of another Hughes script that same year, &quot;Mr. Mom&quot;, earned him a three-film deal with Universal Pictures.

Hughes&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; (1984), won almost unanimous praise when it was released in 1984, due in no small part to its more honest depiction of navigating adolescence and the social dynamics of high school life in stark contrast to the &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot;-inspired comedies made at the time. It was the first in a string of efforts about teenage life set in or around high school, including &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; (1985), &quot;Weird Science&quot; (1985), and &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; (1986), all of which he wrote and directed, and &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; (1986) and &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot; (1987), which he wrote and produced.

===1987–2008: Beyond teen movies===
To avoid being pigeonholed as a maker of only teen movies, Hughes branched out in 1987 by writing, directing, and producing the hit comedy &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles&quot; starring Steve Martin and John Candy. His later output was not so well received critically, with films like &quot;Dutch&quot; (1991), written and produced by Hughes, performing poorly at the box office. Films like &quot;Uncle Buck&quot; and &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot;, however, proved popular. His final film as a director was 1991&#x27;s &quot;Curly Sue&quot;. By that time, in 1991, his John Hughes Entertainment production company had signed various deals with 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros.

Actor John Candy created many memorable roles in films written, directed or produced by Hughes, including &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; (1983), &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles&quot; (1987), &quot;The Great Outdoors&quot; (1988), &quot;Uncle Buck&quot; (1989), &quot;Home Alone&quot; (1990), &quot;Career Opportunities&quot; and &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; (both 1991). Over the years, Hughes and Candy developed a close friendship. Hughes was greatly shaken by Candy&#x27;s sudden death from a heart attack in 1994. &quot;He talked a lot about how much he loved Candy—if Candy had lived longer, I think John would have made more films as a director&quot;, says Vince Vaughn, a friend of Hughes.

Hughes&#x27;s greatest commercial success came with &quot;Home Alone&quot; (1990), a film he wrote and produced about a child accidentally left behind when his family goes away for Christmas, forcing him to protect himself and his house from a pair of inept burglars. Hughes completed the first draft of &quot;Home Alone&quot; in just nine days. &quot;Home Alone&quot; was the top-grossing film of 1990, and remains the most successful live-action family comedy of all time. He followed up with the sequels &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; in 1992 and &quot;Home Alone 3&quot; in 1997. Some of the subsequent films he wrote and produced during this time also contained elements of the &quot;Home Alone&quot; formula, including the successful &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; (1993) and the box office flop &quot;Baby&#x27;s Day Out&quot; (1994). He also wrote screenplays under the pseudonym Edmond Dantes (or Dantès), after the protagonist of Alexandre Dumas&#x27;s novel &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;. Screenplays credited to the Dantes &quot;nom de plume&quot; include &quot;Maid in Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Drillbit Taylor&quot; and &quot;Beethoven&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 1970, the then-20-year old Hughes married Nancy Ludwig, whom he had met in high school. Together they had two children: John Hughes III (b. 1976) and James Hughes (b. 1979). They were together until his death in 2009. Nancy Hughes died on September 15, 2019. Michael Weiss argued that Hughes&#x27;s films expressed a Reagan Republican worldview. In response to this, P. J. O&#x27;Rourke wrote that:

== Later life ==
In 1994, Hughes retired from the public eye and moved back to the Chicago area. The following year, Hughes and Ricardo Mestres, both of whom had production deals with Walt Disney Pictures, formed the short-lived joint venture production studio Great Oaks Entertainment. Hughes worked in Chicago, while Mestres was based in Los Angeles. The company produced the films &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot;, and &quot;Flubber&quot;, but Hughes and Mestres ended their partnership in 1997. The 1998 film &quot;Reach the Rock&quot;, which was produced as part of the partnership between Hughes and Mestres, was subsequently credited as &quot;a Gramercy Pictures release of a John Hughes and Ricardo Mestres production&quot;.

In the following years, Hughes rarely granted interviews to the media, save a select few in 1999 to promote the soundtrack album of &quot;Reach the Rock&quot;. The album was compiled by Hughes&#x27;s son, John Hughes III, and released on his son&#x27;s Chicago-based record label Hefty Records. He also recorded an audio commentary for the 1999 DVD release of &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;.

==Death==
On August 5, 2009, Hughes and his wife traveled to New York City to visit their son James and their new grandson. James said his father appeared to be in good health that night and that the family had made plans for the next day. On the morning of August 6, Hughes was taking a walk close to his hotel on West 55th Street in Manhattan when he suffered a heart attack. He was rushed to Roosevelt Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at age 59. Hughes&#x27;s funeral was held on August 11 in Chicago; he was buried at Lake Forest Cemetery. It was attended by his wife, his two children, and his grandchildren.

==Legacy==
The pilot episode of the NBC comedy &quot;Community&quot;, broadcast on September 17, 2009, was dedicated to Hughes. The episode included several references to &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; and ended with a cover of &quot;Don&#x27;t You (Forget About Me)&quot;. The &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; episode titled &quot;Don&#x27;t You Forget About Me&quot;, broadcast on February 1, 2010, ended with a scene similar to the ending scene of &quot;Sixteen Candles.&quot; It also contained references to other Hughes movies such as &quot;Home Alone&quot;. The 2011 &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot; episode &quot;Sheesh! Cab, Bob?&quot; also paid homage to &quot;Sixteen Candles.&quot; The teen comedy &quot;Easy A&quot; (2010) starring Emma Stone paid tribute to Hughes and his films at the very end, where Stone&#x27;s character states she wishes her life were a John Hughes movie, by showing various clips of &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;, &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;, and &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. While primarily satirizing later 90&#x27;s teen comedies, The parody film &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot; references a number of John Hughes&#x27; 80&#x27;s films including Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, and Pretty in Pink, and is set at a fictional &quot;John Hughes High School&quot;.

After Hughes&#x27;s death, many of those who knew him commented on the impact Hughes had on their lives and on the film industry. Molly Ringwald said, &quot;I was stunned and incredibly sad to hear about the death of John Hughes. He was and will always be such an important part of my life. ... He will be missed – by me and by everyone that he has touched. My heart and all my thoughts are with his family now.&quot; Matthew Broderick also released his own statement, saying, &quot;I am truly shocked and saddened by the news about my old friend John Hughes. He was a wonderful, very talented guy and my heart goes out to his family.&quot; The 82nd Academy Awards (2010) included a tribute to Hughes&#x27;s work. A retrospective of clips from Hughes&#x27;s films was followed by cast members from several of them, including Molly Ringwald, Matthew Broderick, Macaulay Culkin, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, Anthony Michael Hall and Jon Cryer, gathering on stage to commemorate Hughes and his contributions to the film industry.

Hughes&#x27;s work has also influenced a new generation of millennial filmmakers, including M. H. Murray of &quot;Teenagers&quot; fame, who has cited Hughes as one of his main influences. In interviews, Murray stated, &quot;I loved how John Hughes wrote teens ... They were flawed in this genuine sort of way.&quot; Kelly Fremon Craig, who wrote and directed &quot;The Edge of Seventeen&quot;, also cited Hughes as an influence.

Hughes is referenced in the song &quot;Hello Chicago&quot; by the collaborative project between Jesu and Sun Kil Moon, and appears on the album &quot;30 Seconds To The Decline Of Planet Earth&quot;. Mark Kozelek recalls a phone conversation with Hughes in which Kozelek asked him for $15,000 in order to release his album &quot;Songs for a Blue Guitar&quot; (released by his band The Red House Painters). Hughes agreed, stating &quot;You&#x27;re young and on the rise, and I&#x27;m just an old man living in Chicago&quot;. British indie pop band The 1975 cites Hughes as an influence in the band&#x27;s music. Maisie Peters released a song called &quot;John Hughes Movie&quot; in 2021. Hughes&#x27;s films served as inspiration for the style and tone of the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; directed by Jon Watts, who took inspiration from films such as &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;.

<doc id="102469" wikidata="Q314087" url="?curid=102469" title="Ramstein air show disaster">
<text>The Ramstein air show disaster occurred on Sunday, 28 August 1988 during the &quot;Flugtag &#x27;88&quot; airshow at USAF Ramstein Air Base near Kaiserslautern, West Germany. Three aircraft of the Italian Air Force display team collided during their display, crashing to the ground in front of a crowd of about 300,000 people. There were 70 fatalities (67 spectators and 3 pilots), and 346 spectators sustained serious injuries in the resulting explosion and fire. Hundreds more had minor injuries. At the time, it was the deadliest air show accident in history until a 2002 crash at the Sknyliv air show that killed 77.

== Background ==
Ten Aermacchi MB-339 PAN jets from the Italian Air Force display team, Frecce Tricolori, were performing their &quot;pierced heart&quot; (Italian: &quot;Cardioide&quot;, German: &quot;Durchstoßenes Herz&quot;) formation. In this formation, two groups of aircraft trace out a heart shape in front of the audience along the runway. As they reach the lower tip of the heart, the two groups pass each other parallel to the runway. The heart is then pierced by a lone aircraft, flying in the direction of spectators.

== The crash ==


The mid-air collision took place as the two heart-forming groups passed each other and the heart-piercing aircraft hit them. One of the pilots finished the maneuver too early. The piercing aircraft crashed onto the runway and consequently both the fuselage and resulting fireball of aviation fuel tumbled into the spectator area, hitting the crowd and coming to rest against a refrigerated trailer being used to dispense ice cream to the various vendor booths in the area.

At the same time, one of the damaged aircraft from the heart-forming group crashed into the emergency medical evacuation UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, injuring the helicopter&#x27;s pilot, Captain Kim Strader. He died 20 days later, on Saturday, 17 September 1988, at Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas from burns he suffered in the accident.

The pilot of the aircraft that hit the helicopter ejected, but was killed as he hit the runway before his parachute opened. The third aircraft disintegrated in the collision and parts of it were strewn along the runway.

After the crash, the remaining aircraft regrouped and landed at Sembach Air Base.

==Emergency response==
===Scope ===
Of the 31 people who died on impact, 28 had been hit by debris in the form of airplane parts, concertina wire, and items on the ground. Sixteen of the fatalities occurred in the days and weeks after the disaster due to severe burns; the last was the burned and injured helicopter pilot. About 500 people had to seek hospital treatment following the event, and over 600 people reported to the clinic that afternoon to donate blood.

===Criticism===
The disaster revealed serious shortcomings in the handling of large-scale medical emergencies by German civil and American military authorities. US military personnel did not immediately allow German ambulances onto the base, and the rescue work was generally hampered by a lack of efficiency and coordination. The rescue coordination center in Kaiserslautern was unaware of the disaster&#x27;s scale as much as an hour after it occurred, even though several German medevac helicopters and ambulances had already arrived on site and left with patients. American helicopters and ambulances provided the quickest and largest means of evacuating burn victims, but lacked sufficient capacities for treating them, or had difficulty finding them. Further confusion was added by the American military&#x27;s usage of different standards for intravenous catheters from German paramedics. A single standard was codified in 1995, updated with a newer version in 2013 and an amendment to the current standard in 2017.

===Actions===
A crisis counseling center was immediately established at the nearby Southside Base Chapel and remained open throughout the week. Base mental health professionals provided group and individual counseling in the following weeks, and they surveyed the response workers two months following the tragedy and again six months after the disaster to gauge recovery.

===Timeline===


==Investigation==

Several different video recordings of the accident were made. They show that the &quot;piercing&quot; aircraft (Pony 10) came in too low and too fast at the crossing point with the other two groups (five aircraft on the left and four on the right) as they completed the heart-shaped figure. Lead pilot Lieutenant Colonel Ivo Nutarelli, flying Pony 10, was unable to correct his altitude or lower his speed, and collided with the leading airplane (Pony 1, piloted by Lt. Col. Mario Naldini) of the left formation &quot;inside&quot; the figure, destroying the plane&#x27;s tail section with the front of his aircraft. Pony 1 then spiralled out of control, hitting the plane on its lower left (Pony 2, piloted by Captain Giorgio Alessio). Lt. Col. Naldini ejected but was killed as he hit the runway before his parachute opened. His plane crashed onto a taxiway near the runway, destroying a medevac helicopter and fatally injuring its pilot, Captain Kim Strader. Pony 2, the third plane involved in the disaster, was severely damaged from the impact with Pony 1, and crashed beside the runway, exploding in a fireball. Its pilot, Captain Alessio, died on impact.

Pony 10, the aircraft that started the crash, continued on a ballistic trajectory across the runway, completely out of control and in flames, its forward section destroyed by the impact with Pony 1. The plane hit the ground ahead of the spectator stands, exploding in a fireball and destroying a police vehicle parked inside the concertina-wire fence that defined the active runway area. The plane continued, cartwheeling for a distance before picking up the three-strand concertina-wire fence, crossing an emergency access road, slamming into the crowd, and hitting a parked ice cream van. The area of the crash, being centered on the flightline and as close to the airshow as civilian spectators could get, had been considered the &quot;best seats in the house&quot;, and was densely packed. The entire incident, from the collision of the first two planes to the crash into the crowd, took less than seven seconds, leaving almost no time for spectators to escape. The low altitude of the maneuver (45 meters above the crowd) also contributed to the short time frame.

An examination of photos and footage from the disaster showed that Pony 10&#x27;s landing gear came down at some point; it has been suggested that this could have been lowered intentionally as a last second effort by Lt. Col. Nutarelli to slow his plane down and avoid the impact, but there is no substantial evidence pointing to this; the undercarriage could have been lowered by a number of factors. In April 1991, Werner Reith, a German journalist from the newspaper &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot;, suggested in an article that the Ramstein disaster could have been caused by some sudden technical problem—or even sabotage—in Nutarelli&#x27;s plane. No supporting evidence could be collected. Reith pointed out that Lt. Col. Nutarelli and Lt. Col. Naldini were supposed to know details about another air disaster, the 1980 Ustica massacre, citing Italian press sources. Judge Rosario Priore, who was investigating the case at the time, found that they were performing training flights nearby minutes before the Ustica incident, but he definitely rejected their deaths as sabotage.

<doc id="102471" wikidata="Q214240" url="?curid=102471" title="Aude (river)">
<text>The Aude (; ; Latin &quot;Atax&quot; ) is a river of southern France that is long. Its source is in the Pyrenees mountains then runs to Carcassonne and finally reaches the Mediterranean Sea near Narbonne. The river is navigable by raft or canoe for nearly all of its length. It is registered as essential to the Languedoc-Roussillon region.

The river gave its name to the Aude &quot;department&quot;.

==Etymology==
In antiquity, the &quot;Aude&quot; was called &quot;Atax&quot; by the Romans. Some authors in antiquity called the river &quot;Narbôn&quot; (e.g. Polybius).

In 1342 the Roussillon Cartulary of Alart called it the &quot;Auda&quot; or the &quot;Ribera d&#x27;Aude&quot;. In the Middle Ages the terms &quot;Adice&quot;, again &quot;Atax&quot;, &quot;Fluvium Atacis&quot;, &quot;Flumine Atace&quot;, &quot;Flumen Ataze&quot;, and &quot;Juxta Aditum fluvium&quot; were also used to designate the Aude. In all likelihood the current name comes from a gradual evolution of &quot;Atax&quot; given by Strabo (in his &quot;Geography&quot;, Book IV), a word borrowed from the Gallic term &quot;atacos&quot; meaning &quot;spirited&quot; or &quot;very fast&quot;.

==Geography==

===Course===

The river has its source in the &quot;Massif of Carlit&quot; at the Lac d&#x27;Aude at an elevation of in the commune of Les Angles (department of Pyrénées-Orientales) and flows parallel to the Tet. The Col de la Quillane, elevation , marks the boundary of the watershed. The river then flows into the Mediterranean Sea a few kilometres from Narbonne at &quot;Grau de Vendres&quot; (near Cabanes-de-Fleury) on the border between the departments of Aude and Hérault.

At Carcassonne in the Pyrénées its course is oriented north-south. The Aude then presents the characteristics of a mountain stream as it traverses Capcir and feeds several reservoirs (Matemale, Puyvalador) before plunging into gorges (those of Saint-Georges are the most scenic) crossing ancient terrain. Starting from Axat, after being joined by the &quot;Aiguette&quot; on the right bank and the &quot;Rébenty&quot; on the left bank, the river flows through bands of pre-Pyrénéen limestone (in the Pierre-Lys Gorges) and passes through a series of small communes: Quillan, Espéraza, Couiza, Alet-les-Bains, then Limoux. Downstream of this great medieval city, the Aude flows eastwards. This elbow results from a Stream capture, the Aude having once flowed in the valley of the Hers, indicating a deepening by an ancient hydrology following the uplifting of the Pyrénées.

From Carcassonne, the river becomes calmer following the great tectonic furrow which separates the Pyrénées (Corbières) from the Massif Central (Montagne Noire), receiving from these heights a series of tributaries of which the main ones are the Orbieu on the right bank, and the &quot;Argent-Double&quot; and the &quot;Casse&quot; on the left bank. From this point, bordered by the Canal du Midi and sinuous amid vineyards, the Aude enters the broad alluvial plain of Narbonne with the main stream flowing to the Gulf of Lion and some waters diverted to a network of ancient ponds before flowing into the Mediterranean Sea .

===Hydrography===

The Aude has a catchment area of that extends unevenly across six departments: Aude, Pyrénées-Orientales, Ariège, Haute-Garonne, Tarn, and Hérault (Haute-Garonne and Tarn are only affected by the course of tributaries and sub-tributaries of the river). Before Carcassonne, the Aude receives tributary streams of short length which often have the characteristics of mountain torrents.

Starting from the prefecture of Aude department in the lower valley the Aude river joins with the largest rivers, most of them from the Montagne Noire. From upstream to downstream, the main tributaries of the Aude, longer than 10 km, are:

* the Lladura or &quot;Lladure&quot; (16 km), left bank at Réal;
* the Galbe (14 km), left bank at Puyvalador;
* the Bruyante (14 km), left bank at Usson-les-Bains;
* the Aiguette (20 km), right bank at Sainte-Colombe-sur-Guette;
* the Rébenty (34 km), left bank at Saint-Martin-Lys;
* the Saint-Bertrand (19 km), right bank at Quillan;
* the Ruisseau de Fa or &quot;Faby&quot; (14 km), left bank at Espéraza;
* the Sals (20 km), right bank at Couiza;
* the Ruisseau de Castillou, right bank at Alet-les-Bains;
* the Véraza, right bank at Alet-les-Bains;
* the Saint-Polycarpe (13 km), right bank at Limoux;
* the Corneilla (22 km), left bank at Limoux;
* the Cougaing (17 km), left bank at Limoux;
* the Sou de Val de Daigne (30 km), left bank at Cépie;

===Hydrology===
In its upper reaches the Aude has a &quot;nivo-pluvial regime&quot; (with a maximum flow in spring linked to snowmelt). Then from Carcassonne where the average flow rate reaches , the system is almost entirely rainfed (The flow at Grau de Vendres where it meets the Mediterranean is around .)

The Aude is thus characterized in its lower course by a pluvio-nival regime of meridional type with high baseflow in summer, in August at Moussan in the lower alluvial plain not far from the river mouth, against an average of . Heavy autumnal rains enable a rapid rise in the flow rate which peaks in February, and is supported by the spring snowmelt from the Pyrénées mountains.

===Floods of 1999===
Exceptional and sudden rainfall, so characteristic of the Mediterranean climate during the autumnal season, can be the cause of devastating floods such as those of 12 and 13 November 1999. The results of this event, which affected the lower valley of the Aude, were catastrophic: 35 victims, hundreds of people evacuated by helicopter or rescued from thousands of homes, businesses, and commercial premises which were more or less damaged, of vineyards more or less ruined, roads, drinking water networks, and sanitation were seriously affected. The scale of the disaster was due to the combination of two factors: Thunderstorms with rainfall on an unprecedented scale. Up to fell in two days at Lézignan-Corbières, that is to say more than the average annual total. In addition, a strong storm in the Gulf of Lyon led to a rise of in the sea level and, combined with the strong waves and wind, prevented the flow of water already swollen by the torrential rains.

===Floods of 2018===
Remnants of Hurricane Leslie fed a quasi-stationary cold front over southwestern France, generating heavy thunderstorms and leading to flash flooding in that area. The Aude rose to a height of , its highest level since 1891. Carcassonne received of rainfall within five hours; water level in the city rose during that period. At least 14 people died because of the flash flood, mainly in the town of Villegailhenc, Aude.

<text>The historical mystery or historical whodunit is a subgenre of two literary genres, historical fiction and mystery fiction. These works are set in a time period considered historical from the author&#x27;s perspective, and the central plot involves the solving of a mystery or crime (usually murder). Though works combining these genres have existed since at least the early 20th century, many credit Ellis Peters&#x27;s &quot;Cadfael Chronicles&quot; (1977–1994) for popularizing what would become known as the historical mystery. The increasing popularity and prevalence of this type of fiction in subsequent decades has spawned a distinct subgenre recognized by the publishing industry and libraries. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; noted in 2010 of the genre, &quot;The past decade has seen an explosion in both quantity and quality. Never before have so many historical mysteries been published, by so many gifted writers, and covering such a wide range of times and places.&quot; Editor Keith Kahla concurs, &quot;From a small group of writers with a very specialized audience, the historical mystery has become a critically acclaimed, award-winning genre with a toehold on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list.&quot;

Since 1999, the British Crime Writers&#x27; Association has awarded the CWA Historical Dagger award to novels in the genre. The Left Coast Crime conference has presented its Bruce Alexander Memorial Historical Mystery award (for mysteries set prior to 1950) since 2004.

==Origins==
Though the term &quot;whodunit&quot; was coined sometime in the early 1930s, it has been argued that the detective story itself has its origins as early as the 429 BC Sophocles play &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; and the 10th century tale &quot;The Three Apples&quot; from &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; (&quot;Arabian Nights&quot;). During China&#x27;s Ming dynasty (1368–1644), &quot;gong&#x27;an&quot; (&quot;crime-case&quot;) folk novels were written in which government magistrates—primarily the historical Di Renjie of the Tang dynasty (618–907) and Bao Zheng of the Song dynasty (960–1279)—investigate cases and then as judges determine guilt and punishment. The stories were set in the past but contained many anachronisms. Robert van Gulik came across the 18th century anonymously written Chinese manuscript &quot;Di Gong An&quot;, in his view closer to the Western tradition of detective fiction than other &quot;gong&#x27;an&quot; tales and so more likely to appeal to non-Chinese readers, and in 1949 published it in English as &quot;Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee&quot;. He subsequently wrote his own Judge Dee stories (1951–1968) in the same style and time period.

Perhaps the first modern English work that can be classified as both historical fiction and a mystery however is the 1911 Melville Davisson Post story &quot;The Angel of the Lord&quot;, which features amateur detective Uncle Abner in pre-American Civil War West Virginia. Barry Zeman of the Mystery Writers of America calls the Uncle Abner short stories &quot;the starting point for true historical mysteries.&quot; In the 22 Uncle Abner tales Post wrote between 1911 and 1928, the character puzzles out local mysteries with his keen observation and knowledge of the Bible. It was not until 1943 that American mystery writer Lillian de la Torre did something similar in the story &quot;The Great Seal of England&quot;, casting 18th century literary figures Samuel Johnson and James Boswell into Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson roles in what would become the first of her &quot;Dr. Sam: Johnson, Detector&quot; series of stories. In 1944, Agatha Christie published &quot;Death Comes as the End&quot;, a mystery novel set in ancient Egypt and the first full-length historical whodunit. In 1950, John Dickson Carr published the second full-length historical mystery novel called &quot;The Bride of Newgate&quot;, set at the close of the Napoleonic Wars.

==Popularization==
In 1970, Peter Lovesey began a series of novels featuring Sergeant Cribb, a Victorian-era police detective, and Elizabeth Peters&#x27;s Amelia Peabody series (1975–2010) followed the adventures of the titular Victorian lady/archaeologist as she solved mysteries surrounding her excavations in early 20th century Egypt. But historical mystery stories remained an oddity until the late 1970s, with the success of Ellis Peters and her &quot;Cadfael Chronicles&quot; (1977–1994), featuring Benedictine monk Brother Cadfael and set in 12th century Shrewsbury. Umberto Eco&#x27;s one-off &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; (1980) also helped popularize the concept, and starting in 1979, author Anne Perry wrote two series of Victorian era mysteries featuring Thomas Pitt (1979–2013) and William Monk (1990–2013). However it was not until about 1990 that the genre&#x27;s popularity expanded significantly with works such as Lindsey Davis&#x27;s Falco and Flavia Albia novels (1989–2022), set in the Roman Empire of Vespasian; John Maddox Roberts&#x27;s &quot;SPQR&quot; series (1990–2010) and Steven Saylor&#x27;s &quot;Roma Sub Rosa&quot; novels (1991–2018), both set in the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC; and Paul Doherty&#x27;s various series, including the &quot;Hugh Corbett&quot; medieval mysteries (1986–2010), the &quot;Sorrowful Mysteries of Brother Athelstan&quot; (1991–2012), and the &quot;Canterbury Tales of Mystery and Murder&quot; (1994–2012). For Mike Ashley&#x27;s&quot;The Mammoth Book of Historical Detectives&quot; (1995), F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre wrote &quot;Death in the Dawntime&quot;, a locked room mystery (or rather, sealed cave mystery) set in Australia around 35,000 BC, which Ashley suggests is the furthest in the past a historical mystery has been set to date. Diana Gabaldon began the &quot;Lord John&quot; series in 1998, casting a recurring secondary character from her &quot;Outlander&quot; series, Lord John Grey, as a nobleman-military officer-amateur detective in 18th century England. Using the pen name Ariana Franklin, Diana Norman wrote four &quot;Mistress of the Art of Death&quot; novels between 2007 and 2010, featuring 12th-century English medical examiner Adelia Aguilar.

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; noted in 2010 of the genre, &quot;The past decade has seen an explosion in both quantity and quality. Never before have so many historical mysteries been published, by so many gifted writers, and covering such a wide range of times and places.&quot; Editor Keith Kahla concurs, &quot;From a small group of writers with a very specialized audience, the historical mystery has become a critically acclaimed, award-winning genre with a toehold on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list.&quot;

==Awards==
In 1999, the British Crime Writers&#x27; Association awarded the first CWA Historical Dagger award to a novel in the genre. The award was called the Ellis Peters Historical Dagger through 2012. In 2014, Endeavour Press supported the award, which is called the Endeavour Historical Dagger for the 2014 and 2015 awards. The Left Coast Crime conference has presented its Bruce Alexander Memorial Historical Mystery award (for mysteries set prior to 1950) since 2004.

==Variations==
In an early twist of the genre, Josephine Tey&#x27;s &quot;The Daughter of Time&quot; (1951) features a modern police detective who alleviates an extended hospital stay by investigating the 15th century case of Richard III of England and the Princes in the Tower. Georgette Heyer&#x27;s &quot;The Talisman Ring&quot; (1936), set in 1793 England, is a Regency romance with elements of mystery that Jane Aiken Hodge called &quot;very nearly a detective story in period costume&quot;. Many of Heyer&#x27;s other historical romances have thriller elements but to a much lesser extent.

Other variations include mystery novels set in alternate history timelines or even fantasy worlds. These would include &quot;The Ultimate Solution&quot; (1973) by Eric Norden and &quot;Fatherland&quot; (1992) by Robert Harris, both being police procedurals set in alternate timelines where the Nazis won World War II; Randall Garrett&#x27;s Lord Darcy series, taking place in a 20th-century in which magic is possible; and Phyllis Ann Karr&#x27;s &quot;The Idylls of the Queen&quot; (1982), set in King Arthur&#x27;s court as depicted in Arthurian myth and with no attempt at historical accuracy.

The genre would not include fiction which was contemporary at the time of writing, such as Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s canonical Sherlock Holmes works set in Victorian England, or the Lord Peter Wimsey books by Dorothy L. Sayers set in the Interwar period. However, subsequent Holmes and Wimsey books written by other authors decades later could arguably be classified as historical mysteries.

In probability theory, a log-normal (or lognormal) distribution is a continuous probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed. Thus, if the random variable is log-normally distributed, then has a normal distribution. Equivalently, if has a normal distribution, then the exponential function of , has a log-normal distribution. A random variable which is log-normally distributed takes only positive real values. It is a convenient and useful model for measurements in exact and engineering sciences, as well as medicine, economics and other topics (e.g., energies, concentrations, lengths, prices of financial instruments, and other metrics).

The distribution is occasionally referred to as the Galton distribution or Galton&#x27;s distribution, after Francis Galton. The log-normal distribution has also been associated with other names, such as McAlister, Gibrat and Cobb–Douglas.

A log-normal process is the statistical realization of the multiplicative product of many independent random variables, each of which is positive. This is justified by considering the central limit theorem in the log domain (sometimes called Gibrat&#x27;s law). The log-normal distribution is the maximum entropy probability distribution for a random variate —for which the mean and variance of are specified.

==Definitions==
===Generation and parameters===

Let formula_16 be a standard normal variable, and let formula_17 and formula_18 be two real numbers, with formula_19. Then, the distribution of the random variable

:formula_20

is called the log-normal distribution with parameters formula_17 and formula_18. These are the expected value (or mean) and standard deviation of the variable&#x27;s natural logarithm, formula_23, &quot;not&quot; the expectation and standard deviation of formula_24 itself.
This relationship is true regardless of the base of the logarithmic or exponential function: If formula_25 is normally distributed, then so is formula_26 for any two positive numbers formula_27 Likewise, if formula_28 is log-normally distributed, then so is formula_29 where formula_30.

In order to produce a distribution with desired mean formula_31 and variance formula_32 one uses
formula_33 and formula_34

Alternatively, the &quot;multiplicative&quot; or &quot;geometric&quot; parameters formula_35 and formula_36 can be used. They have a more direct interpretation: formula_37 is the median of the distribution, and formula_38 is useful for determining &quot;scatter&quot; intervals, see below.

=== Probability density function ===

A positive random variable formula_24 is log-normally distributed (i.e., formula_40), if the natural logarithm of formula_24 is normally distributed with mean formula_42 and variance formula_43

:formula_44

Let formula_45 and formula_46 be respectively the cumulative probability distribution function and the probability density function of the formula_47 standard normal distribution, then we have that the probability density function of the log-normal distribution is given by:

:formula_48

=== Cumulative distribution function ===

The cumulative distribution function is

: formula_49

where formula_45 is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution (i.e., formula_51).

This may also be expressed as follows:

:formula_52

where is the complementary error function.

=== Multivariate log-normal ===
If formula_53 is a multivariate normal distribution, then formula_54 has a multivariate log-normal distribution. The exponential is applied elementwise to the random vector formula_55. The mean of formula_56 is

:formula_57

and its covariance matrix is

:formula_58

Since the multivariate log-normal distribution is not widely used, the rest of this entry only deals with the univariate distribution.

=== Characteristic function and moment generating function ===

All moments of the log-normal distribution exist and

:formula_59

This can be derived by letting formula_60 within the integral. However, the log-normal distribution is not determined by its moments. This implies that it cannot have a defined moment generating function in a neighborhood of zero. Indeed, the expected value formula_61 is not defined for any positive value of the argument formula_62, since the defining integral diverges.

The characteristic function formula_63 is defined for real values of , but is not defined for any complex value of that has a negative imaginary part, and hence the characteristic function is not analytic at the origin. Consequently, the characteristic function of the log-normal distribution cannot be represented as an infinite convergent series. In particular, its Taylor formal series diverges:

: formula_64

However, a number of alternative divergent series representations have been obtained.

A closed-form formula for the characteristic function formula_65 with formula_62 in the domain of convergence is not known. A relatively simple approximating formula is available in closed form, and is given by

:formula_67

where formula_68 is the Lambert W function. This approximation is derived via an asymptotic method, but it stays sharp all over the domain of convergence of formula_69.

== Properties ==

===Probability in different domains===
The probability content of a log-normal distribution in any arbitrary domain can be computed to desired precision by first transforming the variable to normal, then numerically integrating using the ray-trace method. (Matlab code)

===Probabilities of functions of a log-normal variable===
Since the probability of a log-normal can be computed in any domain, this means that the cdf (and consequently pdf and inverse cdf) of any function of a log-normal variable can also be computed. (Matlab code)

===Geometric or multiplicative moments===

The geometric or multiplicative mean of the log-normal distribution is formula_70. It equals the median. The geometric or multiplicative standard deviation is formula_71.

By analogy with the arithmetic statistics, one can define a geometric variance, formula_72, and a geometric coefficient of variation, formula_73, has been proposed. This term was intended to be &quot;analogous&quot; to the coefficient of variation, for describing multiplicative variation in log-normal data, but this definition of GCV has no theoretical basis as an estimate of formula_74 itself (see also Coefficient of variation).

Note that the geometric mean is smaller than the arithmetic mean. This is due to the AM–GM inequality and is a consequence of the logarithm being a concave function. In fact,

: formula_75

In finance, the term formula_76 is sometimes interpreted as a convexity correction. From the point of view of stochastic calculus, this is the same correction term as in Itō&#x27;s lemma for geometric Brownian motion.

===Arithmetic moments===

For any real or complex number , the -th moment of a log-normally distributed variable is given by
: formula_77

Specifically, the arithmetic mean, expected square, arithmetic variance, and arithmetic standard deviation of a log-normally distributed variable are respectively given by:

:formula_78

The arithmetic coefficient of variation formula_79 is the ratio formula_80. For a log-normal distribution it is equal to
: formula_81
This estimate is sometimes referred to as the &quot;geometric CV&quot; (GCV), due to its use of the geometric variance. Contrary to the arithmetic standard deviation, the arithmetic coefficient of variation is independent of the arithmetic mean.

The parameters and can be obtained, if the arithmetic mean and the arithmetic variance are known:

: formula_82

A probability distribution is not uniquely determined by the moments for . That is, there exist other distributions with the same set of moments. In fact, there is a whole family of distributions with the same moments as the log-normal distribution.

=== Mode, median, quantiles ===

The mode is the point of global maximum of the probability density function. In particular, by solving the equation formula_83, we get that:

: formula_84

Since the log-transformed variable formula_85 has a normal distribution, and quantiles are preserved under monotonic transformations, the quantiles of formula_86 are

: formula_87

where formula_88 is the quantile of the standard normal distribution.

Specifically, the median of a log-normal distribution is equal to its multiplicative mean,

:formula_89

=== Partial expectation ===

The partial expectation of a random variable formula_86 with respect to a threshold formula_91 is defined as

:formula_92

Alternatively, by using the definition of conditional expectation, it can be written as formula_93. For a log-normal random variable, the partial expectation is given by:

:formula_94

where formula_95 is the normal cumulative distribution function. The derivation of the formula is provided in the . The partial expectation formula has applications in insurance and economics, it is used in solving the partial differential equation leading to the Black–Scholes formula.

=== Conditional expectation ===

The conditional expectation of a log-normal random variable formula_86—with respect to a threshold formula_91—is its partial expectation divided by the cumulative probability of being in that range:

:formula_98

=== Alternative parameterizations ===
In addition to the characterization by formula_99 or formula_100, here are multiple ways how the log-normal distribution can be parameterized. ProbOnto, the knowledge base and ontology of probability distributions lists seven such forms: 

* LogNormal1(μ,σ) with mean, μ, and standard deviation, σ, both on the log-scale 
*:formula_101
* LogNormal2(μ,υ) with mean, μ, and variance, υ, both on the log-scale
*:formula_102
* LogNormal3(m,σ) with median, m, on the natural scale and standard deviation, σ, on the log-scale
*:formula_103
* LogNormal4(m,cv) with median, m, and coefficient of variation, cv, both on the natural scale
*:formula_104
* LogNormal5(μ,τ) with mean, μ, and precision, τ, both on the log-scale
*:formula_105
* LogNormal6(m,σg) with median, m, and geometric standard deviation, σg, both on the natural scale
*:formula_106
* LogNormal7(μN,σN) with mean, μN, and standard deviation, σN, both on the natural scale
*:formula_107

==== Examples for re-parameterization ====
Consider the situation when one would like to run a model using two different optimal design tools, for example PFIM and PopED. The former supports the LN2, the latter LN7 parameterization, respectively. Therefore, the re-parameterization is required, otherwise the two tools would produce different results.

For the transition formula_108 following formulas hold formula_109 and formula_110.

For the transition formula_111 following formulas hold formula_112 and formula_113.

All remaining re-parameterisation formulas can be found in the specification document on the project website.

=== Multiple, reciprocal, power ===
* Multiplication by a constant: If formula_114 then formula_115 for formula_116
* Reciprocal: If formula_114 then formula_118
* Power: If formula_114 then formula_120 for formula_121

=== Multiplication and division of independent, log-normal random variables ===
If two independent, log-normal variables formula_122 and formula_123 are multiplied [divided], the product [ratio] is again log-normal, with parameters formula_124 [formula_125] and formula_18, where formula_127.

More generally, if formula_128 are formula_129 independent, log-normally distributed variables, then formula_130

=== Multiplicative central limit theorem ===
The geometric or multiplicative mean of formula_129 independent, identically distributed, positive random variables formula_132 shows, for formula_133, approximately a log-normal distribution with parameters formula_134 and formula_135, assuming formula_136 is finite.

In fact, the random variables do not have to be identically distributed. It is enough for the distributions of formula_137 to all have finite variance and satisfy the other conditions of any of the many variants of the central limit theorem.

This is commonly known as Gibrat&#x27;s law.

=== Heavy-tailness of the Log-Normal ===
Whether a Log-Normal can be considered or not a true heavy-tail distribution is still debated. The main reason is that its variance is always finite, differently from what happen with certain Pareto distributions, for instance. However a recent study has shown how it is possible to create a Log-Normal distribution with infinite variance using Robinson Non-Standard Analysis.

=== Other ===

A set of data that arises from the log-normal distribution has a symmetric Lorenz curve (see also Lorenz asymmetry coefficient).

The harmonic formula_138, geometric formula_139 and arithmetic formula_140 means of this distribution are related; such relation is given by

: formula_141

Log-normal distributions are infinitely divisible, but they are not stable distributions, which can be easily drawn from.

== Related distributions ==
* If formula_142 is a normal distribution, then formula_143
* If formula_114 is distributed log-normally, then formula_145 is a normal random variable.
* Let formula_146 be independent log-normally distributed variables with possibly varying formula_18 and formula_17 parameters, and formula_149. The distribution of formula_150 has no closed-form expression, but can be reasonably approximated by another log-normal distribution formula_151 at the right tail. Its probability density function at the neighborhood of 0 has been characterized and it does not resemble any log-normal distribution. A commonly used approximation due to L.F. Fenton (but previously stated by R.I. Wilkinson and mathematically justified by Marlow) is obtained by matching the mean and variance of another log-normal distribution: formula_152 In the case that all formula_153 have the same variance parameter formula_154, these formulas simplify to formula_155
For a more accurate approximation, one can use the Monte Carlo method to estimate the cumulative distribution function, the pdf and the right tail.

The sum of correlated log-normally distributed random variables can also be approximated by a log-normal distribution formula_156
* If formula_114 then formula_158 is said to have a &quot;Three-parameter log-normal&quot; distribution with support formula_159. formula_160, formula_161.
* The log-normal distribution is a special case of the semi-bounded Johnson&#x27;s SU-distribution.
* If formula_162 with formula_163, then formula_164 (Suzuki distribution).
* A substitute for the log-normal whose integral can be expressed in terms of more elementary functions can be obtained based on the logistic distribution to get an approximation for the CDF formula_165 This is a log-logistic distribution.

== Statistical inference ==
===Estimation of parameters===
==== Maximum likelihood estimator ====

For determining the maximum likelihood estimators of the log-normal distribution parameters &quot;μ&quot; and &quot;σ&quot;, we can use the same procedure as for the normal distribution. Note that
formula_166
where formula_69 is the density function of the normal distribution formula_168. Therefore, the log-likelihood function is
formula_169

Since the first term is constant with regard to &quot;μ&quot; and &quot;σ&quot;, both logarithmic likelihood functions, formula_170 and formula_171, reach their maximum with the same formula_17 and formula_18. Hence, the maximum likelihood estimators are identical to those for a normal distribution for the observations formula_174,
formula_175

For finite &quot;n&quot;, the estimator for formula_17 is unbiased, but the one for formula_18 is biased. As for the normal distribution, an unbiased estimator for formula_18 can be obtained by replacing the denominator &quot;n&quot; by &quot;n&quot;−1 in the equation for formula_179.

From this, the MLE for the expectancy of x is:
formula_180
==== Method of moments ====
When the individual values formula_181 are not available, but the sample&#x27;s mean formula_182 and standard deviation &quot;s&quot; is, then the Method of moments can be used. The corresponding parameters are determined by the following formulas, obtained from solving the equations for the expectation formula_183 and variance formula_184 for formula_17 and formula_18:
formula_187

==== Other estimators ====
Other estimators also exists, such as Finney&#x27;s UMVUE estimator, the &quot;Approximately Minimum Mean Squared Error Estimator&quot;, the &quot;Approximately Unbiased Estimator&quot; and &quot;Minimax Estimator&quot;, also &quot;A Conditional Mean Squared Error Estimator&quot;, and other variations as well.

===Interval estimates===
The most efficient way to obtain interval estimates when analyzing log-normally distributed data consists of applying the well-known methods based on the normal distribution to logarithmically transformed data and then to back-transform results if appropriate.

====Prediction intervals====
A basic example is given by prediction intervals: For the normal distribution, the interval formula_188 contains approximately two thirds (68%) of the probability (or of a large sample), and formula_189 contain 95%. Therefore, for a log-normal distribution,
formula_190 contains 2/3, and
formula_191 contains 95% of the probability. Using estimated parameters, then approximately the same percentages of the data should be contained in these intervals.

====Confidence interval for &quot;eμ&quot;====
Using the principle, note that a confidence interval for formula_17 is formula_193, where formula_194 is the standard error and &quot;q&quot; is the 97.5% quantile of a t distribution with &quot;n-1&quot; degrees of freedom. Back-transformation leads to a confidence interval for formula_195 (the median), is:
formula_196 with formula_197

====Confidence interval for E(X)====

The literature discusses several options for calculating the confidence interval for formula_17 (the mean of the log-normal distribution). These include bootstrap as well as various other methods.

The Cox Method proposes to plug-in the estimators formula_199

and use them to construct approximate confidence intervals in the following way:
formula_200
We know that formula_201. Also, formula_202 is a normal distribution with parameters: formula_203

formula_204 has a chi-squared distribution, which is approximately normally distributed (via CLT), with parameters: formula_205. Hence, formula_206.

Since the sample mean and variance are independent, and the sum of normally distributed variables is also normal, we get that:
formula_207
Based on the above, standard confidence intervals for formula_208 can be constructed (using a Pivotal quantity) as: formula_209
And since confidence intervals are preserved for monotonic transformations, we get that:
formula_210

As desired.

Olsson 2005, proposed a &quot;modified Cox method&quot; by replacing formula_211 with formula_212, which seemed to provide better coverage results for small sample sizes.

====Confidence interval for comparing two log normals====

Comparing two log-normal distributions can often be of interest, for example, from a treatment and control group (e.g., in an A/B test). We have samples from two independent log-normal distributions with parameters formula_213 and formula_214, with sample sizes formula_215 and formula_216 respectively.

Comparing the medians of the two can easily be done by taking the log from each and then constructing straightforward confidence intervals and transforming it back to the exponential scale.

formula_217

These CI are what&#x27;s often used in epidemiology for calculation the CI for relative-risk and odds-ratio. The way it is done there is that we have two approximately Normal distributions (e.g., p1 and p2, for RR), and we wish to calculate their ratio.

However, the ratio of the expectations (means) of the two samples might also be of interest, while requiring more work to develop. The ratio of their means is:

formula_218

Plugin in the estimators to each of these parameters yields also a log normal distribution, which means that the Cox Method, discussed above, could similarly be used for this use-case:

formula_219


To construct a confidence interval for this ratio, we first note that formula_220 follows a normal distribution, and that both formula_221 and formula_222 has a chi-squared distribution, which is approximately normally distributed (via CLT, with the relevant parameters).

This means that
formula_223

Based on the above, standard confidence intervals can be constructed (using a Pivotal quantity) as: formula_224
And since confidence intervals are preserved for monotonic transformations, we get that:
formula_219

As desired.

It&#x27;s worth noting that naively using the MLE in the ratio of the two expectations to create a ratio estimator will lead to a consistent, yet biased, point-estimation (we use the fact that the estimator of the ratio is a log normal distribution) &lt;/math&gt;}}:

formula_226

=== Extremal principle of entropy to fix the free parameter &quot;σ&quot;===

In applications, formula_18 is a parameter to be determined. For growing processes balanced by production and dissipation, the use of an extremal principle of Shannon entropy shows that
formula_228

This value can then be used to give some scaling relation between the inflexion point and maximum point of the log-normal distribution. This relationship is determined by the base of natural logarithm, formula_229, and exhibits some geometrical similarity to the minimal surface energy principle.
These scaling relations are useful for predicting a number of growth processes (epidemic spreading, droplet splashing, population growth, swirling rate of the bathtub vortex, distribution of language characters, velocity profile of turbulences, etc.).
For example, the log-normal function with such formula_18 fits well with the size of secondarily produced droplets during droplet impact and the spreading of an epidemic disease.

The value formula_231 is used to provide a probabilistic solution for the Drake equation.

==Occurrence and applications==
The log-normal distribution is important in the description of natural phenomena. Many natural growth processes are driven by the accumulation of many small percentage changes which become additive on a log scale. Under appropriate regularity conditions, the distribution of the resulting accumulated changes will be increasingly well approximated by a log-normal, as noted in the section above on &quot;Multiplicative Central Limit Theorem&quot;. This is also known as Gibrat&#x27;s law, after Robert Gibrat (1904–1980) who formulated it for companies. If the rate of accumulation of these small changes does not vary over time, growth becomes independent of size. Even if this assumption is not true, the size distributions at any age of things that grow over time tends to be log-normal. Consequently, reference ranges for measurements in healthy individuals are more accurately estimated by assuming a log-normal distribution than by assuming a symmetric distribution about the mean.

A second justification is based on the observation that fundamental natural laws imply multiplications and divisions of positive variables. Examples are the simple gravitation law connecting masses and distance with the resulting force, or the formula for equilibrium concentrations of chemicals in a solution that connects concentrations of educts and products. Assuming log-normal distributions of the variables involved leads to consistent models in these cases.

Specific examples are given in the following subsections. contains a review and table of log-normal distributions from geology, biology, medicine, food, ecology, and other areas. is a review article on log-normal distributions in neuroscience, with annotated bibliography.

=== Human behavior ===

* The length of comments posted in Internet discussion forums follows a log-normal distribution.
* Users&#x27; dwell time on online articles (jokes, news etc.) follows a log-normal distribution.
* The length of chess games tends to follow a log-normal distribution.
* Onset durations of acoustic comparison stimuli that are matched to a standard stimulus follow a log-normal distribution.

=== Biology and medicine ===

* Measures of size of living tissue (length, skin area, weight).
* Incubation period of diseases.
* Diameters of banana leaf spots, powdery mildew on barley.
* For highly communicable epidemics, such as SARS in 2003, if public intervention control policies are involved, the number of hospitalized cases is shown to satisfy the log-normal distribution with no free parameters if an entropy is assumed and the standard deviation is determined by the principle of maximum rate of entropy production.
* The length of inert appendages (hair, claws, nails, teeth) of biological specimens, in the direction of growth.
* The normalised RNA-Seq readcount for any genomic region can be well approximated by log-normal distribution.
* The PacBio sequencing read length follows a log-normal distribution.
* Certain physiological measurements, such as blood pressure of adult humans (after separation on male/female subpopulations).
*Several pharmacokinetic variables, such as Cmax, elimination half-life and the elimination rate constant.
* In neuroscience, the distribution of firing rates across a population of neurons is often approximately log-normal. This has been first observed in the cortex and striatum and later in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, and elsewhere in the brain. Also, intrinsic gain distributions and synaptic weight distributions appear to be log-normal as well.
*Neuron densities in the cerebral cortex, due to the noisy cell division process during neurodevelopment.
*In operating-rooms management, the distribution of surgery duration.
*In the size of avalanches of fractures in the cytoskeleton of living cells, showing log-normal distributions, with significantly higher size in cancer cells than healthy ones.

=== Chemistry ===

* Particle size distributions and molar mass distributions.
* The concentration of rare elements in minerals.
* Diameters of crystals in ice cream, oil drops in mayonnaise, pores in cocoa press cake.

=== Hydrology ===

*In hydrology, the log-normal distribution is used to analyze extreme values of such variables as monthly and annual maximum values of daily rainfall and river discharge volumes.

::The image on the right, made with CumFreq, illustrates an example of fitting the log-normal distribution to ranked annually maximum one-day rainfalls showing also the 90% confidence belt based on the binomial distribution.

::The rainfall data are represented by plotting positions as part of a cumulative frequency analysis.

=== Social sciences and demographics ===

* In economics, there is evidence that the income of 97–99% of the population is distributed log-normally. (The distribution of higher-income individuals follows a Pareto distribution).
* If an income distribution follows a log-normal distribution with standard deviation formula_18, then the Gini coefficient, commonly use to evaluate income inequality, can be computed as formula_233 where formula_234 is the error function, since formula_235, where formula_236 is the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal distribution.
* In finance, in particular the Black–Scholes model, changes in the &quot;logarithm&quot; of exchange rates, price indices, and stock market indices are assumed normal (these variables behave like compound interest, not like simple interest, and so are multiplicative). However, some mathematicians such as Benoit Mandelbrot have argued that log-Lévy distributions, which possesses heavy tails would be a more appropriate model, in particular for the analysis for stock market crashes. Indeed, stock price distributions typically exhibit a fat tail. The fat tailed distribution of changes during stock market crashes invalidate the assumptions of the central limit theorem.
* In scientometrics, the number of citations to journal articles and patents follows a discrete log-normal distribution.
* City sizes (population) satisfy Gibrat&#x27;s Law. The growth process of city sizes is proportionate and invariant with respect to size. From the central limit theorem therefore, the log of city size is normally distributed.
* The number of sexual partners appears to be best described by a log-normal distribution.

=== Technology ===
* In reliability analysis, the log-normal distribution is often used to model times to repair a maintainable system.
* In wireless communication, &quot;the local-mean power expressed in logarithmic values, such as dB or neper, has a normal (i.e., Gaussian) distribution.&quot; Also, the random obstruction of radio signals due to large buildings and hills, called shadowing, is often modeled as a log-normal distribution.
* Particle size distributions produced by comminution with random impacts, such as in ball milling.
* The file size distribution of publicly available audio and video data files (MIME types) follows a log-normal distribution over five orders of magnitude.
* File sizes of 140 million files on personal computers running the Windows OS, collected in 1999.
* Sizes of text-based emails (1990s) and multimedia-based emails (2000s).
* In computer networks and Internet traffic analysis, log-normal is shown as a good statistical model to represent the amount of traffic per unit time. This has been shown by applying a robust statistical approach on a large groups of real Internet traces. In this context, the log-normal distribution has shown a good performance in two main use cases: (1) predicting the proportion of time traffic will exceed a given level (for service level agreement or link capacity estimation) i.e. link dimensioning based on bandwidth provisioning and (2) predicting 95th percentile pricing.
* in physical testing when the test produces a time-to-failure of an item under specified conditions, the data is often best analyzed using a lognormal distribution.

<text>Gwenwynwyn ab Owain Cyfeiliog (died c. 1216) was the last major ruler of mid Wales before the completion of the Norman English invasion. He was one of few native rulers to represent a real threat to the rule of Llywelyn the Great.

==Lineage==
Gwenwynwyn ruled southern Powys (Powys Wenwynwyn) from 1195, and was given charge of the kingdom following the retirement of his father Owain Cyfeiliog. Prior to this, in 1187, he had made an attack on Carreghofa Castle with his brother Cadwallon, in the course of which they killed their father&#x27;s cousin and former ally, Owain Fychan. He had assisted Maelgwn ap Rhys in taking Aberystwyth Castle and capturing Maelgwn&#x27;s brother Gruffydd ap Rhys II, whom he handed over to the English. His military ambitions were temporarily thwarted by his failure at the siege of Painscastle, when Gruffydd returned to battle.

Owain Cyfeiliog had been a notable poet as well as a leader of the resistance against English invasion, and chose to enter the abbey of Strata Marcella in later life; he died in 1197, two years after becoming a monk. Gwenwynwyn continued his father&#x27;s strategy and is thought to have been one of the Welsh rulers who made an agreement with King Richard I of England not to attack his kingdom while he was away on crusade. In 1199, he made peace with Richard&#x27;s successor, John. He was rewarded with marriage to an English noblewoman, Margaret Corbet, the daughter of the Lord of the border territory of Caus, around 1200, as well as the grant of the manor of Ashford.

==Conflict with Llywelyn the Great==
Gwenwynwyn&#x27;s possession of Powys Wenwynwyn brought him into conflict with Llywelyn the Great, ruler of Gwynedd, who was keen to extend his own jurisdiction over the whole of Wales. In 1202 there was an uneasy peace between the two Welsh princes as Gwenwynwyn began attacking Marcher lords, thus losing John&#x27;s favour; this eventually resulted in his being imprisoned at Shrewsbury.

==Conflict with King John==
King John favoured Gwenwynwyn until a marriage alliance was made between Llywelyn and John&#x27;s illegitimate daughter. The two native princes kept their distance until 1207. As a result of Gwenwynwyn&#x27;s aggression, John took him prisoner in 1208 and confiscated his lands, while Llywelyn seized Ceredigion, Aberystwyth, and Powys.

Gwenwynwyn&#x27;s lands were restored to him as a result of John&#x27;s intervention after two years. Freed by the King, he recovered most of his possessions, and accompanied John on an expedition into Wales. However, his continued resentment towards the English led him into an alliance with Llywelyn, which lasted from 1212 until 1216, when John again restored some of Gwenwynwyn&#x27;s property and the two Welsh princes fell out again. Gwenwynwyn was pursued by Llywelyn, who took his lands, and he took refuge in Chester.

==Death and legacy==
Llywelyn invaded Powys, backed by other leaders of the Welsh alliance against the English. Gwenwynwyn, having been driven out of his lands, is believed to have died or been killed later that same year. He was succeeded by Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn, his son by Margaret Corbet, who was eventually restored to his lands after Llywelyn&#x27;s death, and continued to feud with the princes of Gwynedd.

<doc id="102478" wikidata="Q6555" url="?curid=102478" title="Narbonne">
<text>Narbonne ( , , ; ; ; Late Latin:) is a commune in Southern France in the Occitanie region. It lies from Paris in the Aude department, of which it is a sub-prefecture. It is located about from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and was historically a prosperous port.

From the 14th century it declined following a change in the course of the river Aude. While it is the largest commune in Aude, the capital of the Aude department is the smaller commune of Carcassonne.

==Etymology==
The source of the town&#x27;s original name of Narbo is lost in antiquity, and it may have referred to a hillfort from the Iron Age close to the location of the current settlement or its occupants. The earliest known record of the area comes from the Greek Hecataeus of Miletus in the fifth century BC, who identified it as a Celtic harbor and marketplace at that time, and called its inhabitants the &quot;Ναρβαῖοι&quot;. In ancient inscriptions the name is sometimes rendered in Latin and sometimes translated into Iberian as &quot;Nedhena&quot;.

==History==
===Under the Romans===
Narbonne was established in Gaul by the Roman Republic in 118 BC, as , colloquially , and made into the capital of the newly established province of Gallia Transalpina. It was located on the Via Domitia, the first Roman road in Gaul, built at the time of the foundation of the colony, and connecting Italy to Spain. Geographically, Narbonne was therefore located at a very important crossroads because it was situated where the Via Domitia connected to the Via Aquitania, which led toward the Atlantic through Tolosa and Burdigala. In addition, it was crossed by the river Aude. Surviving members of Julius Caesar&#x27;s Legio X Equestris were given lands in the area that today is called Narbonne. 

Politically, Narbonne gained importance as a competitor to Massilia (Marseille). Julius Caesar settled veterans from his 10th Legion there and attempted to develop its port while Marseille was supporting Pompey. Among the products of Narbonne, its rosemary-flower honey was famous among Romans.

Later, the province of Gallia Transalpina was renamed Gallia Narbonensis after the city, which became its capital. Seat of a powerful administration, the city enjoyed economic and architectural expansion. At that point, the city is thought to have had 30,000–50,000 inhabitants, and may have had as many as 100,000.

===Under the Visigoths===
According to Hydatius, in 462 the city was handed over to the Visigoths by a local military leader in exchange for support; as a result Roman rule ended in the city. It was subsequently the capital of the Visigothic province of Septimania, the only territory from Gaul to fend off the Frankish thrust after the Battle of Vouille (507). In 531, Frankish king, Childebert I, invaded Septimania and defeated Visigothic king, Amalaric near Narbonne and occupied the city. However, after Childebert&#x27;s continued invasion to Catalonia failed, Amalaric&#x27;s successor Theudis was able to reclaim the rich province of Septimania, including Narbonne. Following the loss of Toledo and Barcelona in 711/712, the last two kings of the Visigoths, Agila II and Ardo retreated to Narbonne, where they were able to resist Muslim attacks until 716.

===Under the Arabs===

For 40 years, from 719 to 759, Narbonne was part of the Umayyad Caliphate. The Umayyad governor Al-Samh captured Narbonne from the Kingdom of Visigoths in 719.

===Under the Carolingians===
The Carolingian Pepin the Short conquered Narbonne from the Arabs in 759 after which it became part of the Carolingian Viscounty of Narbonne. He invited prominent Jews from the Caliphate of Baghdad to settle in Narbonne and establish a major Jewish learning center for Western Europe. In the 12th century, the court of Ermengarde of Narbonne (reigned 1134 to 1192) presided over one of the cultural centers where the spirit of courtly love was developed.

The historian Arthur J. Zuckerman wrote in 1973 the book &quot;A Jewish Princedom in Feudal France&quot;, presenting the thesis that from the 8th to 10 centuries AD there was a Jewish vassal princedom based in Narbonne, given to the Jews by the Carolingian king Pepin as a gift of gratitude for their cooperation in the Frankish conquest of Narbonne from Al-Andalus in the year 759. This is however controversial, the book having been criticized by other historians.

===Under the Capets===
In the 11th and 12th centuries, Narbonne was home to an important Jewish exegetical school, which played a pivotal role in the growth and development of the Zarphatic (Judæo-French) and Shuadit (Judæo-Provençal) languages. Jews had settled in Narbonne from about the 5th century, with a community that numbered about 2,000 people in the 12th century. At this time, Narbonne was frequently mentioned in Talmudic works in connection with its scholars. One source, Abraham ibn Daud of Toledo, gives them an importance similar to the exilarchs of Babylon. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the community went through a series of ups and downs before settling into extended decline.

===Narbonne loses its river and port===

Narbonne itself fell into a slow decline in the 14th century, for a variety of reasons. One was due to a change in the course of the river Aude, which caused increased silting of the navigational access. The river, known as the Atax in ancient times, had always had two main courses which split close to Salelles; one fork going south through Narbonne and then to the sea close to the Clappe Massif, the other heading east to the etang at Vendres close to the current mouth of the river well to the east of the city. The Romans had improved the navigability of the river by building a dam near Salelles and also by canalising the river as it passed through its marshy delta to the sea (then as now the canal was known as the Robine.) A major flood in 1320 swept the dam away. The Aude river had a long history of overflowing its banks. When it was a bustling port, the distance from the coast was approximately , but at that time the access to the sea was deep enough only when the river was in full spate which made communication between port and city unreliable. However, goods could easily be transported by land and in shallow barges from the ports (there were several: a main port and forward ports for larger vessels; indeed the navigability from the sea into the &quot;étang&quot; and then into the river had been a perennial problem)

The changes to the long seashore which resulted from the silting up of the series of &quot;graus&quot; or openings which were interspersed between the islands which made up the shoreline (St. Martin; St. Lucie) had a more serious impact than the change in course of the river. Other causes of decline were the plague and the raid of Edward, the Black Prince, which caused much devastation. The growth of other ports was also a factor.

===Narbonne Cathedral===
Narbonne Cathedral, dedicated to Saints Justus and Pastor, provides stark evidence of Narbonne&#x27;s sudden and dramatic change of fortunes when one sees at the rear of the structure the enormously ambitious building programme frozen in time, for the cathedral—still one of the tallest in France—was never finished. The reasons are many, but the most important is that the completed cathedral would have required demolishing the city wall. The 14th century also brought the plague and a host of reasons for retaining the 5th-century (pre-Visigothic) walls.

Yet the choir, side chapels, sacristy, and courtyard remain intact, and the cathedral, although no longer the seat of a bishop or archbishop, remains the primary place of worship for the Roman Catholic population of the city, and is a major tourist attraction.

===Building of the Canal de la Robine===
From the sixteenth century, eager to maintain a link to important trade, the people of Narbonne began costly work to the vestiges of the river Aude&#x27;s access to the sea so that it would remain navigable to a limited draft vessel and also serve as a link with the Royal Canal. This major undertaking resulted in the construction of the Canal de la Robine, which was finally linked with the Canal du Midi (then known as the Royal Canal) via the Canal de Jonction in 1776.

In the 19th century, the canal system in the south of France had to compete with an expanding rail network, which could ship goods more quickly. The canals kept some importance as they were used to support the flourishing wine trade.

Despite its decline from Roman times, Narbonne held on to its vital but limited importance as a trading route. This has continued in more recent centuries.

==Geography==
Narbonne is linked to the nearby Canal du Midi and the river Aude by the Canal de la Robine, which runs through the centre of town. It is very close to the A9 motorway, which connects Montpellier and Nîmes to Perpignan and, across the border, to Barcelona in Spain. There is also a recently renovated train station which serves the TGV to Spain, Paris and Calais, which in turn connects to the Eurostar. Narbonne is only 10 km from Narbonne Plage (beach), but it is only 2 km from the nearest open water, at La Nautique, although there is no sand, rather pebbles.

<text>The Via Domitia was the first Roman road built in Gaul, to link Italy and Hispania through Gallia Narbonensis, across what is now Southern France. The route that the Romans regularised and paved was ancient when they set out to survey it, and traces the mythic route travelled by Heracles.

The construction of the road was commissioned by Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, whose name it bore, following the defeat of the Allobroges and Averni by himself and Quintus Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus in 122 BCE. Domitius also established a fortified garrison at Narbo (modern Narbonne) on the coast, near Hispania, to guard construction of the road. It soon developed into a full Roman colony &quot;Colonia Narbo Martius&quot;. The lands on the western part of the route, beyond the River Rhône had been under the control of the Averni who, according to Strabo, had stretched their control to Narbo and the Pyrenees.

Crossing the Alps by the easiest passage, the Col de Montgenèvre (1850 m), the Via Domitia followed the valley of the Durance, crossed the Rhône at Beaucaire passed through Nîmes (Nemausus) then followed the coastal plain along the Gulf of Lion. At Narbonne, it met the Via Aquitania (which led toward the Atlantic Ocean through Toulouse and Bordeaux). Thus Narbonne was a crucial strategic crossroads of the Via Domitia and the Via Aquitania, and it was an accessible, but easily defensible port at that time. 

This &quot;cusp point&quot; in the Roman westwards expansion and ensuing supply, communication and fortification was a very important asset, and was treated as such (see Narbonne). In between the cities that it linked, the Via Domitia was provided with a series of &quot;mansiones&quot; at distances of a day&#x27;s journey for a loaded cart, at which shelter, provender and fresh horses could be obtained for travellers on official business.

The route as it was in Late Antiquity is represented in schematic fashion on the &quot;Tabula Peutingeriana&quot;.

<text>Stormarn () is a district in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Segeberg and Ostholstein, the city of Lübeck, the district of Lauenburg, and the city-state of Hamburg.

==History==

In medieval times the name Stormarn was applied to a larger area, of which the present-day district is only the eastern half. It was the home of the Saxon tribe the Sturmarii.

Stormarn became a part of Holstein in the 12th century. When Schleswig-Holstein became a province of Prussia in 1867, the Prussian administration established the district of Stormarn, with Wandsbek as its capital. In 1937 the southwestern part of the district was incorporated into Hamburg, and the district lost half of its population. Since Wandsbek was now a borough of Hamburg, the capital was moved to Bad Oldesloe after the war. In 1970 Stormarn again lost a substantial portion of its territory, when the city of Norderstedt was founded in order to become a part of the Segeberg district.

==Geography==

The river Trave runs through the district before entering the city of Lübeck. In the southernmost portion of Stormarn there are the eastern suburbs of the Hamburg metropolitan area.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays a white swan, with a crown around its neck, on red ground. The swan has been the heraldic animal of Stormarn since the Middle Ages.

<doc id="102485" wikidata="Q152499" url="?curid=102485" title="Peninsular War">
<text>The Peninsular War (1807–1814) was fought in the Iberian Peninsula by Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom against the invading and occupying forces of the First French Empire during the Napoleonic Wars. In Spain, it is considered to overlap with the Spanish War of Independence.

The war started when the French and Spanish armies invaded and occupied Portugal in 1807 by transiting through Spain, and it escalated in 1808 after Napoleonic France occupied Spain, which had been its ally. Napoleon Bonaparte forced the abdications of Ferdinand VII and his father Charles IV and then installed his brother Joseph Bonaparte on the Spanish throne and promulgated the Bayonne Constitution. Most Spaniards rejected French rule and fought a bloody war to oust them. The war on the peninsula lasted until the Sixth Coalition defeated Napoleon in 1814, and is regarded as one of the first wars of national liberation. It is also significant for the emergence of large-scale guerrilla warfare.

In 1808, the Spanish army in Andalusia defeated the French at the Battle of Bailén, considered the first open-field defeat of the Napoleonic army on a European battlefield. Besieged by 70,000 French troops, a reconstituted national government, the Cortes—in effect a government-in-exile—fortified itself in the secure port of Cádiz in 1810. The British army, under Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington, guarded Portugal and campaigned against the French alongside the reformed Portuguese Army and provided whatever supplies they could get to the Spanish, while the Spanish armies and guerrillas tied down vast numbers of Napoleon&#x27;s troops. In 1812, when Napoleon set out with a massive army on what proved to be a disastrous French invasion of Russia, a combined allied army defeated the French at Salamanca and took the capital Madrid. In the following year the Coalition scored a victory over King Joseph Bonaparte&#x27;s army at the Battle of Vitoria paving the way for victory in the war in the Iberian Peninsula. 

Pursued by the armies of Britain, Spain and Portugal, Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult, no longer getting sufficient support from a depleted France, led the exhausted and demoralized French forces in a fighting withdrawal across the Pyrenees during the winter of 1813–1814. The years of fighting in Spain were a heavy burden on France&#x27;s . While the French enjoyed several victories in battle, they were eventually defeated, as their communications and supplies were severely tested and their units were frequently isolated, harassed or overwhelmed by Spanish partisans fighting an intense guerrilla war of raids and ambushes. The Spanish armies were repeatedly beaten and driven to the peripheries, but they would regroup and relentlessly hound and demoralize the French troops. This drain on French resources led Napoleon, who had unwittingly provoked a total war, to call the conflict the &quot;Spanish Ulcer&quot;.

War and revolution against Napoleon&#x27;s occupation led to the Spanish Constitution of 1812, promulgated by the Cortes of Cádiz, later a cornerstone of European liberalism. Though victorious in war, the burden of war destroyed the social and economic fabric of both Portugal and Spain; and the following civil wars between liberal and absolutist factions ushered in revolts in Spanish America and the beginning of an era of social turbulence, increased political instability, and economic stagnation.

==1807==

===Extortion of Portugal===
The Treaties of Tilsit, negotiated during a meeting in July 1807 between Emperors Alexander I of Russia and Napoleon, concluded the War of the Fourth Coalition. With Prussia shattered, and the Russian Empire allied with the First French Empire, Napoleon expressed irritation that Portugal was open to trade with Britain. Pretexts were plentiful; Portugal was Britain&#x27;s oldest ally in Europe, Britain was finding new opportunities for trade with Portugal&#x27;s colony in Brazil, the Royal Navy used Lisbon&#x27;s port in its operations against France, and he wanted to deny the British the use of the Portuguese fleet. Furthermore, Prince John of Braganza, regent for his insane mother Queen Maria I, had declined to join the emperor&#x27;s Continental System against British trade.

Events moved rapidly. The Emperor sent orders on 19 July 1807 to his Foreign Minister, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, to order Portugal to declare war on Britain, close its ports to British ships, detain British subjects on a provisional basis and sequester their goods. After a few days, a large force started concentrating at Bayonne. Meanwhile, the Portuguese government&#x27;s resolve was stiffening, and shortly afterward Napoleon was once again told that Portugal would not go beyond its original agreements. Napoleon now had all the pretext that he needed, while his force, the First Corps of Observation of the Gironde with divisional general Jean-Andoche Junot in command, was prepared to march on Lisbon. After he received the Portuguese answer, he ordered Junot&#x27;s corps to cross the frontier into the Spanish Empire.

While all this was going on, the secret Treaty of Fontainebleau had been signed between France and Spain. The document was drawn up by Napoleon&#x27;s marshal of the palace Géraud Duroc and Eugenio Izquierdo, an agent for Manuel Godoy. The treaty proposed to carve up Portugal into three entities. Porto and the northern part was to become the Kingdom of Northern Lusitania, under Charles II, Duke of Parma. The southern portion, as the Principality of the Algarves, would fall to Godoy. The rump of the country, centered on Lisbon, was to be administered by the French. According to the Treaty of Fontainebleau, Junot&#x27;s invasion force was to be supported by 25,500 Spanish troops. On 12 October, Junot&#x27;s corps began crossing the Bidasoa River into Spain at Irun. Junot was selected because he had served as ambassador to Portugal in 1805. He was known as a good fighter and an active officer, although he had never exercised independent command.

===Spanish dilemma===
By 1800, Spain was in a state of social unrest. Townsfolk and peasants all over the country, who had been forced to bury family members in new municipal cemeteries rather than churches or other consecrated ground, took back their bodies at night and tried to restore them to their old resting-places. In Madrid, the growing numbers of &quot;&quot;afrancesados&quot;&quot; (Francophiles) at court were opposed by the &quot;majos&quot;: shopkeepers, artisans, tavern keepers, and laborers who dressed in traditional style, and took pleasure in picking fights with &quot;petimetres&quot;, the young who styled themselves with French fashion and manners.

Spain was an ally of Napoleon&#x27;s First French Empire; however, defeat in the naval Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805, which had decimated Spain&#x27;s navy, had removed the reason for alliance with France. Manuel Godoy, the favorite of King Charles IV of Spain, began to seek some form of escape. At the start of the War of the Fourth Coalition, which pitted the Kingdom of Prussia against Napoleon, Godoy issued a proclamation that was obviously aimed at France, even though it did not specify an enemy. After Napoleon&#x27;s decisive victory at the Battle of Jena–Auerstedt, Godoy quickly withdrew the proclamation. However, it was too late to avert Napoleon&#x27;s suspicions. Napoleon planned from that moment to deal with his inconstant ally at some future time. In the meantime, the Emperor forced Godoy and Charles IV into providing a division of Spanish troops to serve in northern Europe. The Division of the North spent the winter of 1807–1808 in Swedish Pomerania, Mecklenburg, and towns of the old Hanseatic League and Spanish troops marched into Denmark in early 1808.

===Invasion of Portugal===

Napoleon instructed Junot, with the cooperation of Spanish military troops, to invade Portugal, moving west from Alcántara along the Tagus valley to Portugal, a distance of only . On 19 November 1807, the French troops under Junot set out for Lisbon and occupied it on 30 November.

The Prince Regent John escaped, loading his family, courtiers, state papers and treasure aboard the fleet, protected by the British, and fled to Brazil. He was joined in flight by many nobles, merchants and others. With 15 warships and more than 20 transports, the fleet of refugees weighed anchor on 29 November and set sail for the colony of Brazil. The flight had been so chaotic that 14 carts loaded with treasure were left behind on the docks.

As one of Junot&#x27;s first acts, the property of those who had fled to Brazil was sequestered and a 100-million-franc indemnity imposed. The army formed into a Portuguese Legion, and went to northern Germany to perform garrison duty. Junot did his best to calm the situation by trying to keep his troops under control. While the Portuguese authorities were generally subservient toward their French occupiers, the ordinary Portuguese were angry, and the harsh taxes caused bitter resentment among the population. By January 1808, there were executions of persons who resisted the exactions of the French. The situation was dangerous, but it would need a trigger from outside to transform unrest into revolt.

==1808==
===Coup d&#x27;état===

Between 9 and 12 February, the French divisions of the eastern and western Pyrenees crossed the border and occupied Navarre and Catalonia, including the citadels of Pamplona and Barcelona. The Spanish government demanded explanations from their French allies, but these did not satisfy and in response Godoy pulled Spanish troops out of Portugal. Since Spanish fortress commanders had not received instructions from the central government, they were unsure how to treat the French troops, who marched openly as allies with flags flying and bands announcing their arrival. Some commanders opened their fortresses to them, while others resisted. General Guillaume Philibert Duhesme, who occupied Barcelona with 12,000 troops, soon found himself besieged in the citadel; he was not relieved until January 1809.

On 20 February, Joachim Murat was appointed lieutenant of the emperor and commander of all French troops in Spain, which now numbered 60,000–100,000. On 24 February, Napoleon declared that he no longer considered himself bound by the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In early March, Murat established his headquarters in Vitoria and received 6,000 reinforcements from the Imperial Guard.

On 19 March 1808, Godoy fell from power in the Mutiny of Aranjuez and Charles IV was forced to abdicate in favour of his son, Ferdinand VII. In the aftermath of the abdication, attacks on &quot;godoyistas&quot; were frequent. On 23 March, Murat entered Madrid with pomp. Ferdinand VII arrived on 27 March and asked Murat to get Napoleon&#x27;s confirmation of his accession. Charles IV, however, was persuaded to protest his abdication to Napoleon, who summoned the royal family, both kings included, to Bayonne in France. There on 5 May, under French pressure, the two kings both abdicated their claims to Napoleon. Napoleon then had the Junta de Gobierno—the council of regency in Madrid—formally ask him to appoint his brother Joseph as King of Spain. The abdication of Ferdinand was only publicised on 20 May.

===Iberia in revolt===
On 2 May, the citizens of Madrid rebelled against the French occupation; the uprising was put down by Joachim Murat&#x27;s elite Imperial Guard and Mamluk cavalry, which crashed into the city and trampled the rioters. In addition, the Mamelukes of the Imperial Guard of Napoleon fought residents of Madrid, wearing turbans and using curved scimitars, thus provoking memories of Muslim Spain. The next day, as immortalized by Francisco Goya in his painting &quot;The Third of May 1808&quot;, the French army shot hundreds of Madrid&#x27;s citizens. Similar reprisals occurred in other cities and continued for days. Bloody, spontaneous fighting known as &quot;guerrilla&quot; (literally &quot;little war&quot;) broke out in much of Spain against the French as well as the Ancien Régime&#x27;s officials. Although the Spanish government, including the Council of Castile, had accepted Napoleon&#x27;s decision to grant the Spanish crown to his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, the Spanish population rejected Napoleon&#x27;s plans. The first wave of uprisings were in Cartagena and Valencia on 23 May; Zaragoza and Murcia on 24 May; and the province of Asturias, which cast out its French governor on 25 May and declared war on Napoleon. Within weeks, all the Spanish provinces followed suit. After hearing of the Spanish uprising, Portugal erupted in revolt in June. A French detachment under Louis Henri Loison crushed the rebels at Évora on 29 July and massacred the town&#x27;s population.

The deteriorating strategic situation led France to increase its military commitments. By 1 June, over 65,000 troops were rushing into the country to control the crisis. The main French army of 80,000 held a narrow strip of central Spain from Pamplona and San Sebastián in the north to Madrid and Toledo in the centre. The French in Madrid sheltered behind an additional 30,000 troops under Marshal Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey. Jean-Andoche Junot&#x27;s corps in Portugal was cut off by of hostile territory, but within days of the outbreak of revolt, French columns in Old Castile, New Castile, Aragon and Catalonia were searching for the insurgent forces.

===Conventional warfare===
To defeat the insurgency, Pierre Dupont de l&#x27;Étang led 24,430 men south toward Seville and Cádiz; Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessières moved into Aragon and Old Castile with 25,000 men, aiming to capture Santander and Zaragoza. Moncey marched toward Valencia with 29,350 men, and Guillaume Philibert Duhesme marshalled 12,710 troops in Catalonia and moved against Girona.

At the two successive Combats of El Bruc outside Barcelona, local Catalan militia, the &quot;Miquelets&quot; (also known as &quot;sometents&quot;), defeated François Xavier de Schwarz&#x27;s 4,000 troops. Guillaume Philibert Duhesme&#x27;s Franco-Italian division of almost 6,000 troops failed to storm Girona and was forced to return to Barcelona. Six thousand French troops under Charles Lefebvre-Desnouettes attacked Zaragoza and were beaten off by José de Palafox y Melci&#x27;s militia. Moncey&#x27;s push to take Valencia ended in failure, with 1,000 French recruits dying in an attempt to storm the city. After defeating Spanish counterattacks, Moncey retreated. At the Battle of Medina de Rioseco on 14 July, Bessières defeated Cuesta and Old Castile returned to French control. Blake escaped, but the Spaniards lost 2,200 men and thirteen guns. French losses were minimal at 400 men. Bessières&#x27;s victory salvaged the French army&#x27;s strategic position in northern Spain. Joseph entered Madrid on 20 July; and on 25 July he was crowned King of Spain. On 10 June, five French ships of the line anchored at Cádiz were seized by the Spanish. Dupont was disturbed enough to curtail his march at Cordoba, and then on 16 June to fall back to Andújar. Cowed by the mass hostility of the Andalusians, he broke off his offensive and was then defeated at Bailén, where he surrendered his entire Army Corps to Castaños.

The catastrophe was total. With the loss of 24,000 troops, Napoleon&#x27;s military machine in Spain collapsed. Stunned by the defeat, on 1 August Joseph evacuated the capital for Old Castile, while ordering Verdier to abandon the siege of Zaragoza and Bessières to retire from Leon; the entire French army sheltered behind the Ebro. By this time, Girona had resisted a Second Siege. Europe welcomed this first check to the hitherto unbeatable Imperial armies—a Bonaparte had been chased from his throne; tales of Spanish heroism inspired Austria and showed the force of national resistance. Bailén set in motion the rise of the Fifth Coalition.

===British intervention===

Britain&#x27;s involvement in the Peninsular War was the start of a prolonged campaign in Europe to increase British military power on land and liberate the Iberian peninsula from the French. In August 1808, 15,000 British troops—including the King&#x27;s German Legion—landed in Portugal under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Wellesley, who drove back Henri François Delaborde&#x27;s 4,000-strong detachment at Roliça on 17 August and smashed Junot&#x27;s main force of 14,000 men at Vimeiro. Wellesley was replaced at first by Sir Harry Burrard and then Sir Hew Dalrymple. Dalrymple granted Junot an unmolested evacuation from Portugal by the Royal Navy in the controversial Convention of Cintra in August. In early October 1808, following the scandal in Britain over the Convention of Cintra and the recall of the generals Dalrymple, Burrard and Wellesley, Sir John Moore took command of the 30,000-man British force in Portugal. In addition, Sir David Baird, in command of an expedition of reinforcements out of Falmouth consisting of 150 transports carrying between 12,000 and 13,000 men, convoyed by HMS &quot;Louie&quot;, HMS &quot;Amelia&quot; and HMS &quot;Champion&quot;, entered Corunna Harbour on 13 October. Logistical and administrative problems prevented any immediate British offensive.

Meanwhile, the British had made a substantial contribution to the Spanish cause by helping to evacuate some 9,000 men of La Romana&#x27;s Division of the North from Denmark. In August 1808, the British Baltic fleet helped transport the Spanish division, except three regiments that failed to escape, back to Spain by way of Gothenburg in Sweden. The division arrived in Santander in October 1808.

===Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Spain===
After the surrender of a French army corps at Bailén and the loss of Portugal, Napoleon was convinced of the peril he faced in Spain. With his of 278,670 men drawn up on the Ebro, facing 80,000 raw, disorganized Spanish troops, Napoleon and his marshals carried out a massive double envelopment of the Spanish lines in November 1808. Napoleon struck with overwhelming strength and the Spanish defense evaporated at Burgos, Tudela, Espinosa and Somosierra. The Junta was forced to abandon Madrid in November 1808, and resided in the Alcázar of Seville from 16 December 1808 until 23 January 1810. Madrid surrendered on 1 December and Joseph Bonaparte was restored to his throne. In Catalonia, Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr&#x27;s 17,000-strong VII Corps besieged and captured Roses from an Anglo-Spanish garrison, destroyed part of Juan Miguel de Vives y Feliu&#x27;s Spanish army at Cardedeu near Barcelona on 16 December and routed the Spaniards under Conde de Caldagues and Theodor von Reding at Molins de Rei.

===Corunna campaign, 1808–1809===
By November 1808, the British army led by Moore was advancing into Spain with orders to assist the Spanish armies&#x27; fight against Napoleon&#x27;s forces. Moore decided to attack Soult&#x27;s scattered and isolated 16,000-man corps&#x27; at Carrión, opening his attack with a successful raid by Lieutenant-General Paget&#x27;s cavalry on the French &quot;picquets&quot; at Sahagún on 21 December.

Abandoning plans to immediately conquer Seville and Portugal, Napoleon rapidly amassed 80,000 troops and debouched from the Sierra de Guadarrama into the plains of Old Castile to encircle the British Army. Moore retreated for the safety of the British fleet at La Coruna and Soult failed to intercept him. The rearguard of La Romana&#x27;s retreating force was overrun at Mansilla on 30 December by Soult, who captured León the next day. Moore&#x27;s retreat was marked by a breakdown of discipline in many regiments and punctuated by stubborn rearguard actions at Benavente and Cacabelos. The British troops escaped to the sea after fending off a strong French attack at Corunna, in which Moore was killed. Some 26,000 troops reached Britain, with 7,000 men lost over the course of the expedition. The French occupied the most populated region in Spain, including the important towns of Lugo and La Corunna. The Spanish were shocked by the British retreat. Napoleon returned to France on 19 January 1809 to prepare for war with Austria, giving the Spanish command back to his marshals.

==1809==

===Spanish campaign, early 1809===

====Fall of Zaragoza====

Zaragoza, already scarred from Lefebvre&#x27;s bombardments that summer, was under a second siege that had commenced on 20 December. Lannes and Moncey committed two army corps of 45,000 men and considerable artillery firepower. Palafox&#x27;s second defence brought the city enduring national and international fame. The Spaniards fought with determination, endured disease and starvation, entrenching themselves in convents and burning their own homes. The garrison of 44,000 was left with 8,000 survivors1,500 of them ill but the did not advance beyond the Ebro. On 20 February 1809, the garrison capitulated, leaving behind burnt-out ruins filled with 64,000 corpses, of which 10,000 were French.

====First Madrid offensive====
The Junta took over direction of the Spanish war effort and established war taxes, organized an Army of La Mancha, signed a treaty of alliance with Britain on 14 January 1809 and issued a royal decree on 22 May to convene at Cortes. An attempt by the Spain&#x27;s Army of the Centre to recapture Madrid ended with the complete destruction of the Spanish forces at Uclés on 13 January by Victor&#x27;s I Corps. The French lost 200 men while their Spanish opponents lost 6,887. King Joseph made a triumphant entry into Madrid after the battle. Sébastiani defeated Cartaojal&#x27;s army at Ciudad Real on 27 March, inflicting 2,000 casualties and suffering negligible losses. Victor invaded southern Spain and routed Gregorio de la Cuesta&#x27;s army at Medellín near Badajoz on 28 March, where Cuesta lost 10,000 men in a staggering defeat, while the French lost only 1,000.

====Liberation of Galicia====
On 27 March, Spanish forces defeated the French at Vigo, recaptured most of the cities in the province of Pontevedra and forced the French to retreat to Santiago de Compostela. On 7 June, the French army of Marshal Michel Ney was defeated in the Battle of Puente Sanpayo in Pontevedra by Spanish forces under the command of Colonel Pablo Morillo, and Ney and his forces retreated to Lugo on 9 June while being harassed by Spanish guerrillas. Ney&#x27;s troops joined up with those of Soult and these forces withdrew for the last time from Galicia in July 1809.

====French advance in Catalonia====
In Catalonia, Saint-Cyr defeated Reding again at Valls on 25 February. Reding was killed and his army lost 3,000 men for French losses of 1,000. Saint-Cyr began the third siege of Girona on 6 May and the city finally fell on 12 December. Louis-Gabriel Suchet&#x27;s III Corps was defeated at Alcañiz by Blake on 23 May, losing 2,000 men. Suchet retaliated at María on 15 June, crushing Blake&#x27;s right wing and inflicting 5,000 casualties. Three days later, Blake lost 2,000 more men to Suchet at Belchite. Saint-Cyr was relieved of his command in September for deserting his troops.

===Second Portuguese campaign===
After Corunna, Soult turned his attention to the invasion of Portugal. Discounting garrisons and the sick, Soult&#x27;s II Corps had 20,000 men for the operation. He stormed the Spanish naval base at Ferrol on 26 January 1809, capturing eight ships of the line, three frigates, several thousand prisoners and 20,000 Brown Bess muskets, which were used to re-equip the French infantry. In March 1809, Soult invaded Portugal through the northern corridor, with Francisco da Silveira&#x27;s 12,000 Portuguese troops unraveling amid riot and disorder, and within two days of crossing the border at Monterrey, Soult had taken the fortress of Chaves. Swinging west, 16,000 of Soult&#x27;s professional troops attacked and killed 4,000 of 25,000 unprepared and undisciplined Portuguese at Braga at the cost of 200 Frenchmen. At the First Battle of Porto on 29 March, the Portuguese defenders panicked, many attempting to flee alongside the city&#x27;s residents south over the river Douro, to die in the Porto Boat Bridge disaster. Between 6,000 and 20,000 Portuguese soldiers were dead, wounded or captured. Suffering fewer than 500 casualties, Soult had secured Portugal&#x27;s second city and, with its valuable dockyards and arsenals intact, captured immense quantities of supplies. Soult halted at Porto to refit his army before advancing on Lisbon.

Wellesley returned to Portugal in April 1809 to command the British army, reinforced with Portuguese regiments trained by General Beresford. These new forces turned Soult out of Portugal at the Battle of Grijó (10–11 May) and the Second Battle of Porto (12 May), and the other northern cities were recaptured by General Silveira. Soult escaped without his heavy equipment by marching through the mountains to Orense.

===Spanish campaign, late 1809===

====Talavera campaign====
With Portugal secured, Wellesley advanced into Spain to unite with Cuesta&#x27;s forces. Victor&#x27;s I Corps retreated before them from Talavera. Cuesta&#x27;s pursuing forces fell back after Victor&#x27;s reinforced army, now commanded by Marshal Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, drove upon them. Two British divisions advanced to help the Spanish. On 27 July at the Battle of Talavera, the French advanced in three columns and were repulsed several times, but at a heavy cost to the Anglo-Allied force, which lost 7,500 men for French losses of 7,400. Wellesley withdrew from Talavera on 4 August to avoid being cut off by Soult&#x27;s converging army, which defeated a Spanish blocking force in an assault crossing at the River Tagus near Puente del Arzobispo. Lack of supplies and the threat of French reinforcement in the spring led Wellington to retreat into Portugal. A Spanish attempt to capture Madrid after Talavera failed at Almonacid, where Sébastiani&#x27;s IV Corps inflicted 5,500 casualties on the Spanish, forcing them to retreat at the cost of 2,400 French losses.

====Second Madrid offensive====
The Spanish Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom was forced by popular pressure to set up the Cortes of Cádiz in the summer of 1809. The Junta came up with what it hoped would be a war-winning strategy, a two-pronged offensive to recapture Madrid, involving over 100,000 troops in three armies under the Duke del Parque, Juan Carlos de Aréizaga and the Duke of Alburquerque. Del Parque defeated Jean Gabriel Marchand&#x27;s VI Corps at the Battle of Tamames on 18 October 1809 and occupied Salamanca on 25 October. Marchand was replaced by François Étienne de Kellermann, who brought up reinforcements in the form of his own men as well as General of Brigade Nicolas Godinot&#x27;s force. Kellermann marched on Del Parque&#x27;s position at Salamanca, who promptly abandoned it and retreated south. In the meantime, the guerrillas in the Province of León increased their activity. Kellermann left the VI Corps holding Salamanca and returned to León to stamp out the uprising.

Aréizaga&#x27;s army was destroyed by Soult at the Battle of Ocaña on 19 November. The Spanish lost 19,000 men compared to French losses of 2,000. Albuquerque soon abandoned his efforts near Talavera. Del Parque moved on Salamanca again, hustling one of the VI Corps brigades out of Alba de Tormes and occupying Salamanca on 20 November. Hoping to get between Kellermann and Madrid, Del Parque advanced towards Medina del Campo. Kellermann counterattacked and was repulsed at the Battle of Carpio on 23 November. The next day, Del Parque received news of the Ocaña disaster and fled south, intending to shelter in the mountains of central Spain. On the afternoon of 28 November, Kellermann attacked Del Parque at Alba de Tormes and routed him after inflicting losses of 3,000 men. Del Parque&#x27;s army fled into the mountains, its strength greatly reduced through combat and non-combat causes by mid-January.

==1810==
===Joseph I&#x27;s régime===


Joseph contented himself with working within the apparatus extant under the old regime, while placing responsibility for local government in many provinces in the hands of royal commissioners. After much preparation and debate, on 2 July 1809 Spain was divided into 38 new provinces, each headed by an Intendant appointed by King Joseph, and on 17 April 1810 these provinces were converted into French-style prefectures and sub-prefectures.

The French obtained a measure of acquiescence among the propertied classes. Francisco de Goya, who remained in Madrid throughout the French occupation, painted Joseph&#x27;s picture and documented the war in a series of 82 prints called &quot;Los Desastres de la Guerra&quot; (&quot;The Disasters of War&quot;). For many imperial officers, life could be comfortable. Among the liberal, republican and radical segments of the Spanish and Portuguese populations there was much support for a potential French invasion. The term &quot;afrancesado&quot; (&quot;turned French&quot;) was used to denote those who supported the Enlightenment, secular ideals, and the French Revolution. Napoleon relied on support from these &quot;afrancesados&quot; both in the conduct of the war and administration of the country. Napoleon removed all feudal and clerical privileges but most Spanish liberals soon came to oppose the occupation because of the violence and brutality it brought. Marxians wrote that there was a positive identification on the part of the people with the Napoleonic revolution, but this is probably impossible to substantiate by the reasons for collaboration being practical rather than ideological.

===Emergence of the guerrilla===

The Peninsular War is regarded as one of the first people&#x27;s wars, significant for the emergence of large-scale guerrilla warfare. It is from this conflict that the English language borrowed the word. The guerrillas troubled the French troops, but they also frightened their own countrymen with forced conscription and looting. Many of the partisans were either fleeing the law or trying to get rich. Later in the war the authorities tried to make the guerrillas reliable, and many of them formed regular army units such as Espoz y Mina&#x27;s &quot;Cazadores de Navarra&quot;. The French believed that enlightened absolutism had made less progress in Spain and Portugal than elsewhere, and that resistance was the product of a century&#x27;s worth of what the French perceived as backwardness in knowledge and social habits, Catholic obscurantism, superstition and counter-revolution.

The guerrilla style of fighting was the Spanish military&#x27;s single most effective tactic. Most organized attempts by regular Spanish forces to take on the French ended in defeat. Once a battle was lost and the soldiers reverted to their guerrilla roles, they tied down large numbers of French troops over a wide area with a much lower expenditure of men, energy, and supplies and facilitated the conventional victories of Wellington and his Anglo-Portuguese army and the subsequent liberation of Portugal and Spain. Mass resistance by the people of Spain inspired the war efforts of Austria, Russia and Prussia against Napoleon.

Hatred of the French and devotion to &quot;God, King and Fatherland&quot; were not the only reason to join the Partisans. The French imposed restrictions on movement and on many traditional aspects of street life, so opportunities to find alternative sources of income were limitedindustry was at a standstill and many &quot;señores&quot; were unable to pay their existing retainers and domestic servants, and could not take on new staff. Hunger and despair reigned on all sides. Because the military record was so dismal, many Spanish politicians and publicists exaggerated the activities of the guerrillas.

===Revolution under siege===
The French invaded Andalusia on 19 January 1810. 60,000 French troopsthe corps of Victor, Mortier and Sebastiani together with other formationsadvanced southwards to assault the Spanish positions. Overwhelmed at every point, Aréizaga&#x27;s men fled eastwards and southwards, leaving town after town to fall into the hands of the enemy. The result was revolution. On 23 January the Junta Central at Seville decided to flee to the safety of Cádiz. It then dissolved itself on 29 January 1810 and set up a five-person Regency Council of Spain and the Indies, charged with convening the Cortes. Soult cleared all of southern Spain except Cádiz, which he left Victor to blockade. The system of juntas was replaced by a regency and the Cortes of Cádiz, which established a permanent government under the Constitution of 1812.

Cádiz was heavily fortified, while the harbour was full of British and Spanish warships. Alburquerque&#x27;s army and the Voluntarios Distinguidos had been reinforced by 3,000 soldiers who had fled Seville, and a strong Anglo-Portuguese brigade commanded by General William Stewart. Shaken by their experiences, the Spaniards had abandoned their earlier scruples about a British garrison. Victor&#x27;s French troops camped at the shoreline and tried to bombard the city into surrender. Thanks to British naval supremacy, a naval blockade of the city was impossible. The French bombardment was ineffectual and the confidence of the &quot;gaditanos&quot; grew and persuaded them that they were heroes. With food abundant and falling in price, the bombardment was hopeless despite both hurricane and epidemica storm destroyed many ships in the spring of 1810 and the city was ravaged by yellow fever.

Once Cádiz was secured, attention turned to the political situation. The Junta Central announced that the &quot;cortes&quot; would open on 1 March 1810. Suffrage was to be extended to all male householders over 25. After public voting, representatives from district-level assemblies would choose deputies to send to the provincial meetings that would be the bodies from which the members of the &quot;cortes&quot; would emerge. From 1 February 1810, the implementation of these decrees had been in the hands of the new regency council selected by the Junta Central. The viceroyalties and independent captaincies general of the overseas territories would each send one representative. This scheme was resented in America for providing unequal representation to the overseas territories. Unrest erupted in Quito and Charcas, which saw themselves as the capitals of kingdoms and resented being subsumed in the larger &quot;kingdom&quot; of Peru. The revolts were suppressed (See Luz de América and Bolivian War of Independence). Throughout early 1809 the governments of the capitals of the viceroyalties and captaincies general elected representatives to the Junta, but none arrived in time to serve on it.

===Third Portuguese campaign===


Convinced by intelligence that a new French assault on Portugal was imminent, Wellington created a powerful defensive position near Lisbon, to which he could fall back if necessary. To protect the city, he ordered the construction of the Lines of Torres Vedras—three strong lines of mutually supporting forts, blockhouses, redoubts, and ravelins with fortified artillery positionsunder the supervision of Sir Richard Fletcher. The various parts of the lines communicated with each other by semaphore, allowing immediate response to any threat. The work began in the autumn of 1809 and the main defences were finished just in time one year later. To further hamper the enemy, the areas in front of the lines were subjected to a scorched earth policy: they were denuded of food, forage and shelter. 200,000 inhabitants of neighbouring districts were relocated inside the lines. Wellington exploited the facts that the French could conquer Portugal only by conquering Lisbon, and that they could in practice reach Lisbon only from the north. Until these changes occurred the Portuguese administration was free to resist British influence, Beresford&#x27;s position being rendered tolerable by the firm support of the Minister of War, Miguel de Pereira Forjaz.

As a prelude to invasion, Ney took the Spanish fortified town of Ciudad Rodrigo after a siege lasting from 26 April to 9 July 1810. The French re-invaded Portugal with an army of around 65,000, led by Marshal Masséna, and forced Wellington back through Almeida to Busaco. At the Battle of the Côa the French drove back Robert Crauford&#x27;s Light Division after which Masséna moved to attack the held British position on the heights of Bussacoa -long ridgeresulting in the Battle of Buçaco on 27 September. Suffering heavy casualties, the French failed to dislodge the Anglo-Portuguese army. Masséna outmaneuvered Wellington after the battle, who steadily fell back to the prepared positions in the Lines. Wellington manned the fortifications with &quot;secondary troops&quot;25,000 Portuguese militia, 8,000 Spaniards and 2,500 British Royal Marines and Royal Artillerymen—keeping his main field army of British and Portuguese regulars dispersed to meet a French assault on any point of the Lines.

Masséna&#x27;s Army of Portugal concentrated around Sobral in preparation to attack. After a fierce skirmish on 14 October in which the strength of the Lines became apparent, the French dug themselves in rather than launch a full-scale assault and Masséna&#x27;s men began to suffer from the acute shortages in the region. In late October, after holding his starving army before Lisbon for a month, Masséna fell back to a position between Santarém and Rio Maior.

==1811==
===Stalemate in the west===
During 1811, Victor&#x27;s force was diminished because of requests for reinforcement from Soult to aid his siege of Badajoz. This brought the French numbers down to between 20,000 and 15,000 and encouraged the defenders of Cádiz to attempt a breakout, in conjunction with the arrival of an Anglo-Spanish relief army of around 12,000 infantry and 800 cavalry under the overall command of Spanish General Manuel La Peña, with the British contingent being led by Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Graham. Marching towards Cádiz on 28 February, this force defeated two French divisions under Victor at Barrosa. However, the Allies failed to exploit their success and Victor soon renewed the blockade. From January through March 1811, Soult with 20,000 men besieged and captured the fortress towns of Badajoz and Olivenza in Extremadura, capturing 16,000 prisoners, before returning to Andalusia with most of his army. Soult was relieved at the operation&#x27;s speedy conclusion, for intelligence received on 8 March told him that Francisco Ballesteros&#x27; Spanish army was menacing Seville, that Victor had been defeated at Barrosa and that Masséna had retreated from Portugal. Soult redeployed his forces to deal with these threats.

In March 1811, with supplies exhausted, Masséna retreated from Portugal to Salamanca. Wellington went over to the offensive later that month. An Anglo-Portuguese army led by the British general William Beresford and a Spanish army led by the Spanish generals Joaquín Blake and Francisco Castaños, attempted to retake Badajoz by laying siege to the French garrison Soult had left behind. Soult regathered his army and marched to relieve the siege. Beresford lifted the siege and his army intercepted the marching French. At the Battle of Albuera, Soult outmaneuvered Beresford but could not win the battle. He retired his army to Seville.

In April, Wellington besieged Almeida. Masséna advanced to its relief, attacking Wellington at Fuentes de Oñoro (3–5 May). Both sides claimed victory but the British maintained the blockade and the French retired without being attacked. After this battle, the Almeida garrison escaped through the British lines in a night march. Masséna was forced to withdraw, having lost a total of 25,000 men in Portugal, and was replaced by Auguste Marmont. Wellington joined Beresford and renewed the siege of Badajoz. Marmont joined Soult with strong reinforcements and Wellington retired.

Wellington soon appeared before Ciudad Rodrigo. In September, Marmont repelled him and re-provisioned the fortress. Sorties continued to be made out of Cádiz from April to August 1811, and British naval gunboats destroyed French positions at St. Mary&#x27;s. An attempt by Victor to crush the small Anglo-Spanish garrison at Tarifa over the winter of 1811–1812 was frustrated by torrential rains and an obstinate defence, marking an end to French operations against the city&#x27;s outer works.

===French conquest of Aragon and Catalonia===
After a two-week siege, the French Army of Aragon under its commander, General Suchet, captured the town of Tortosa from the Spanish in Catalonia on 2 January 1811. MacDonald&#x27;s VII Corps was defeated in a vanguard skirmish at El Pla.

The Spanish commander Francesc Rovira captured in a coup-de-main the key fortress of Sant Ferran Castle at Figueres with 2,000 &quot;miquelets&quot; on 10 April. The French Army of Catalonia under MacDonald blockaded the city to starve the defenders into surrender. With the help of a relief operation on 3 May, the fortress held out until 17 August, when lack of food prompted a surrender after a last-ditch breakout attempt failed.

On 5 May, Suchet besieged the vital city of Tarragona, which functioned as a port, a fortress, and a resource base that sustained the Spanish field forces in Catalonia. Suchet was given a third of the Army of Catalonia and the city fell to a surprise attack on 29 June. Suchet&#x27;s troops massacred 2,000 civilians. Napoleon rewarded Suchet with a Marshal&#x27;s baton. On 25 July, Suchet drove the Spanish out of their positions on the Montserrat mountain range. In October, the Spanish launched a counterattack that recaptured Montserrat and took 1,000 prisoners from scattered French garrisons in the area. In September, Suchet launched an invasion of the province of Valencia. He besieged the castle of Sagunto and defeated Blake&#x27;s relief attempt. The Spanish defenders capitulated on 25 October. Suchet trapped Blake&#x27;s entire army of 28,044 men in the city of Valencia on 26 December and forced it to surrender on 9 January 1812 after a brief siege. Blake lost 20,281 men dead or captured. Suchet advanced south, capturing the port town of Dénia. The redeployment of a substantial part of his troops for the invasion of Russia ground Suchet&#x27;s operations to a halt. The victorious Marshal had established a secure base in Aragon and was ennobled by Napoleon as the Duke of Albufera, after a lagoon south of Valencia.

The war now fell into a temporary lull, with the superior French unable to find an advantage and coming under increasing pressure from Spanish guerrillas. The French had over 350,000 soldiers in , but over 200,000 were deployed to protect the French lines of supply, rather than as substantial fighting units.

==1812==

===Allied campaign in Spain===
Wellington renewed the allied advance into Spain in early 1812, besieging and capturing the border fortress town of Ciudad Rodrigo by assault on 19 January and opening up the northern invasion corridor from Portugal into Spain. This also allowed Wellington to proceed to move to capture the southern fortress town of Badajoz, which would prove to be one of the bloodiest siege assaults of the Napoleonic Wars. The town was stormed on 6 April, after a constant artillery barrage had breached the curtain wall in three places. Tenaciously defended, the final assault and the earlier skirmishes left the allies with some 4,800 casualties. These losses appalled Wellington who said of his troops in a letter, &quot;I greatly hope that I shall never again be the instrument of putting them to such a test as that to which they were put last night.&quot; The victorious troops massacred 200–300 Spanish civilians.

The allied army subsequently took Salamanca on 17 June, just as Marshal Marmont approached. The two forces met on 22 July, after weeks of manoeuvre, when Wellington soundly defeated the French at the Battle of Salamanca, during which Marmont was wounded. The battle established Wellington as an offensive general and it was said that he &quot;defeated an army of 40,000 men in 40 minutes.&quot; The Battle of Salamanca was a damaging defeat for the French in Spain, and while they regrouped, Anglo-Portuguese forces moved on Madrid, which surrendered on 14August; 20,000 muskets, 180 cannon and two French Imperial Eagles were captured.

===French autumn counterattack===
After the allied victory at Salamanca on 22 July 1812, King Joseph Bonaparte abandoned Madrid on 11 August. Because Suchet had a secure base at Valencia, Joseph and Marshal Jean-Baptiste Jourdan retreated there. Soult, realising he would soon be cut off from his supplies, ordered a retreat from Cádiz set for 24 August; the French were forced to end the two-and-a-half-year-long siege. After a long artillery barrage, the French placed together the muzzles of over 600 cannons to render them unusable to the Spanish and British. Although the cannons were useless, the Allied forces captured 30 gunboats and a large quantity of stores. The French were forced to abandon Andalusia for fear of being cut off by the allied armies. Marshals Suchet and Soult joined Joseph and Jourdan at Valencia. Spanish armies defeated the French garrisons at Astorga and Guadalajara.

As the French regrouped, the allies advanced towards Burgos. Wellington besieged Burgos between 19 September and 21 October, but failed to capture it. Together, Joseph and the three marshals planned to recapture Madrid and drive Wellington from central Spain. The French counteroffensive caused Wellington to lift the siege of Burgos and retreat to Portugal in the autumn of 1812, pursued by the French and losing several thousand men. Napier wrote that about 1,000 allied troops were killed, wounded and missing in action, and that Hill lost 400 between the Tagus and the Tormes, and another 100 in the defence of Alba de Tormes. 300 were killed and wounded at the Huebra where many stragglers died in woodland, and 3,520 allied prisoners were taken to Salamanca up to 20 November. Napier estimated that the double retreat cost the allies around 9,000, including the loss in the siege, and said French writers said 10,000 were taken between the Tormes and the Agueda. But Joseph&#x27;s dispatches said the whole loss was 12,000, including the garrison of Chinchilla, whereas English authors mostly reduced the British loss to hundreds. As a consequence of the Salamanca campaign, the French were forced to evacuate the provinces of Andalusia and Asturias.

==1813==

===Defeat of King Joseph===

By the end of 1812, the large army that had invaded the Russian Empire, the , had ceased to exist. Unable to resist the oncoming Russians, the French had to evacuate East Prussia and the Grand Duchy of Warsaw. With both the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia joining his opponents, Napoleon withdrew more troops from Spain, including some foreign units and three battalions of sailors sent to assist with the siege of Cádiz. In total, 20,000 men were withdrawn; the numbers were not overwhelming, but the occupying forces were left in a difficult position. In much of the area under French control—the Basque provinces, Navarre, Aragon, Old Castile, La Mancha, the Levante, and parts of Catalonia and León—the remaining presence was a few scattered garrisons. Trying to hold a front line in an arc from Bilbao to Valencia, they were still vulnerable to assault, and had abandoned hopes of victory. According to Esdaile, the best policy would have been to have fallen back to the Ebro, but the political situation in 1813 made this impossible; Napoleon wanted to avoid being seen as weak by the German princes, who were watching the advancing Russians and wondering whether they should change sides. French prestige suffered another blow when on 17 March &quot;el rey intruso&quot; (the &quot;Intruder King&quot;, a nickname many Spanish had for King Joseph) left Madrid in the company of another vast caravan of refugees.

In 1813, Wellington marched 121,000 troops (53,749 British, 39,608 Spanish, and 27,569 Portuguese) from northern Portugal across the mountains of northern Spain and the Esla River, skirting Jourdan&#x27;s army of 68,000 strung out between the Douro and the Tagus. Wellington shortened his communications by shifting his base of operations to the northern Spanish coast, and the Anglo-Portuguese forces swept northwards in late May and seized Burgos, outflanking the French army and forcing Joseph Bonaparte into the Zadorra valley.

At the Battle of Vitoria on 21 June, Joseph&#x27;s 65,000-man army was defeated decisively by Wellington&#x27;s army of 57,000 British, 16,000 Portuguese and 8,000 Spanish. Wellington split his army into four attacking &quot;columns&quot; and attacked the French defensive position from south, west and north while the last column cut down across the French rear. The French were forced back from their prepared positions, and despite attempts to regroup and hold were driven into a rout. This led to the abandonment of all of the French artillery as well as King Joseph&#x27;s extensive baggage train and personal belongings. The latter led to many Anglo-Allied soldiers abandoning the pursuit of the fleeing troops, to instead loot the wagons. This delay, along with the French managing to hold the east road out of Vitoria towards Salvatierra, allowed the French to partially recover. The Allies chased the retreating French, reaching the Pyrenees in early July, and began operations against San Sebastian and Pamplona. On 11 July, Soult was given command of all French troops in Spain and in consequence Wellington decided to halt his army to regroup at the Pyrenees.

The war was not over. Although Bonapartist Spain had effectively collapsed, most of France&#x27;s troops had retreated in order and fresh troops were soon gathering beyond the Pyrenees. By themselves, such forces were unlikely to score more than a few local victories, but French troop losses elsewhere in Europe could not be taken for granted. Napoleon might yet inflict defeats on Austria, Russia and Prussia, and with the divisions between the allies there was no guarantee that one power would not make a separate peace. It was a major victory and gave Britain more credibility on the continent, but the thought of Napoleon descending on the Pyrenees with the was not regarded with equanimity.

===End of the war in Spain===
====Campaign in the eastern Atlantic region====

In August 1813, British headquarters still had misgivings about the eastern powers moving into France. Austria had now joined the Allies, but the Allied armies had suffered a significant defeat at the Battle of Dresden. They had recovered somewhat, but the situation was still precarious. Wellington&#x27;s brother-in-law Edward Pakenham wrote, &quot;I should think that much must depend upon proceedings in the north: I begin to apprehend ... that Boney may avail himself of the jealousy of the Allies to the material injury of the cause.&quot; But the defeat or defection of Austria, Russia, and Prussia was not the only danger. It was also uncertain that Wellington could continue to count on Spanish support.

The summer of 1813 in the Basque provinces and Navarre was a wet one, with the army drenched by incessant rain, and the decision to strip the men of their greatcoats was looking unwise. Sickness was widespread—at one point a third of Wellington&#x27;s British troops were &quot;hors de combat&quot;—and fears about the army&#x27;s discipline and general reliability grew. By 9 July, Wellington reported that 12,500 men were absent without leave, while plundering was rife. Major General Sir Frederick Robinson wrote, &quot;We paint the conduct of the French in this country in very ... harsh colours, but be assured we injure the people much more than they do ... Wherever we move devastation marks our steps.&quot; With the army poised on the borders of France, desertion had become a problem. The Chasseurs Britanniques—recruited mainly from French deserters—lost 150 men in a single night. Wellington wrote, &quot;The desertion is terrible, and is unaccountable among the British troops. I am not astonished that the foreigners should go ... but, unless they entice away the British soldiers, there is no accounting for their going away in such numbers as they do.&quot; Spain&#x27;s &quot;ragged and ill-fed soldiers&quot; were also suffering with the onset of winter. The fear that they would likely &quot;fall on the populace with the utmost savagery&quot; in revenge attacks and looting was a growing concern to Wellington as the Allied forces pushed to the French border.

Marshal Soult began a counter-offensive (the Battle of the Pyrenees) and defeated the Allies at the Battle of Maya and the Battle of Roncesvalles (25 July). The Roncesvalles wing of Soult&#x27;s army pushed on into Spain, and by 27 July was within ten miles of Pamplona. There its way was blocked by a substantial allied force posted on a high ridge in between the villages of Sorauren and Zabaldica. The French lost momentum and were repulsed by the Allies at the Battle of Sorauren (28 and 30 July) Soult ordered General of Division Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d&#x27;Erlon commanding one corps of 21,000 men to attack and secure the Maya Pass. General of Division Honoré Reille was ordered by Soult to attack and seize the Roncesvalles Pass with his corps and the corps of General of Division Bertrand Clausel of 40,000 men. Reille&#x27;s right wing suffered further losses at Yanzi (1 August); and Echallar and Ivantelly (2 August) during its retreat into France. Total losses during this counter-offensive were about 7,000 for the Allies and 10,000 for the French.

With 18,000 British and Portuguese troops, Wellington besieged the French-garrisoned city of San Sebastián under Brigadier-General Louis Emmanuel Rey from 7 to 25 July. Wellington interrupted the siege during Soult&#x27;s counter-offensive, but left sufficient forces under Graham to prevent sorties or any relief getting in. The siege was resumed on 22 August. On 31 August, the allies stormed the city with heavy losses. The attacking troops became drunk, and sacked and burned the entire city. Meanwhile, the French garrison retreated into the city&#x27;s citadel. They held out until 8 September, and marched out the next day with full military honours. on the day that San Sebastián fell, Soult attempted to relieve it, but in the battles of Vera and San Marcial was repulsed by the Spanish Army of Galicia under General Manuel Freire. The losses in the entire siege were about 4,000 alles, and 20,000 French. Wellington next determined to throw his left across the river Bidassoa to strengthen his own position, and secure the port of Fuenterrabia.

At daylight on 7 October 1813 Wellington crossed the Bidassoa in seven columns, and attacked the entire French position, which stretched in two heavily entrenched lines from north of the Irun–Bayonne road, along mountain spurs to the Great Rhune, high. The decisive movement was a passage in strength near Fuenterrabia to the astonishment of the French, who in view of the width of the river and the shifting sands, had thought the crossing impossible at that point. The French right was then rolled back, and Soult was unable to reinforce his right in time to retrieve the day. His works fell in succession after hard fighting, and he withdrew towards the river Nivelle. The losses were about—Allies, 800; French, 1,600. The passage of the Bidassoa &quot;was a general&#x27;s not a soldier&#x27;s battle&quot;.

On 31 October Pamplona surrendered, and Wellington was now anxious to drive Suchet from Catalonia before invading France. The British government, however, in the interests of the continental powers, urged an immediate advance over the northern Pyrenees into south-eastern France. Napoleon had just suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Leipzig on 19 October and was in retreat, so Wellington left the clearance of Catalonia to others.

====Campaign in the northern Mediterranean region====
In the northern Mediterranean region of Spain (Catalonia) Suchet had defeated Elio&#x27;s Murcians at Yecla and Villena (11 April 1813), but was subsequently routed by Lieutenant General Sir John Murray, Commander of a British expedition from the Mediterranean islands at the battle of Castalla (13 April), who then besieged Tarragona. The siege was abandoned after a time, but was later on renewed by Lieutenant General Lord William Bentinck. Suchet, after the Battle of Vitoria, evacuated Tarragona (17 August) but defeated Bentinck in the battle of Ordal (13 September).

The military historian Sir Charles Oman wrote that because of &quot;[Napoleon&#x27;s] absurdly optimistic reliance on&quot; the Treaty of Valençay (11 December 1813), during the last month of 1813 and the early months of 1814 Suchet was ordered by the French War office to relinquish command of many of his infantry and cavalry regiments for use in the campaign in north-east France where Napoleon was greatly outnumbered. This reduced Suchet&#x27;s French Catalonian army from 87,000 to 60,000 of whom 10,000 were on garrison duty. By the end of January through redeployment and wastage (through disease and desertion) the number had fallen to 52,000 of whom only 28,000 were available for field operations; the others were either on garrison duties or guarding the lines of communication back into France.

Suchet thought that the armies under the command of the Spanish General Copons and the British General Clinton amounted to 70,000 men (in fact they only had about as many as he did), so Suchet remained on the defensive.

On 10 January 1814 Suchet received orders from the French War Ministry that he withdraw his field force to the foothills of the Pyrenees and to make a phased withdraw from the outlying garrisons. On ratification of the Treaty of Valençay he was to move his force to the French city of Lyons. On 14 January he received further orders that because the situation was so grave on the eastern front he was to immediately send further forces to the east, even though ratification of the Treaty of Valençay had not been received. This would reduce the size of Suchet&#x27;s field army to 18,000 men.

The Allies heard that Suchet was hemorrhaging men and mistakenly thought that his army was smaller than it was, so on 16 January they attacked. Suchet had not yet started the process of sending more men back to France and was able to stop the Sicilians (and a small contingent of British artillery in support) at the Battle of Molins de Rey because he still had a local preponderance of men. The allies suffered 68 casualties; the French, 30 killed and about 150 wounded.

After Suchet sent many men to Lyons, he left an isolated garrison in Barcelona and concentrated his forces on the town of Gerona calling in flying columns and evacuating some minor outposts. However his field army was now down to 15,000 cavalry and infantry (and excluding the garrisons in northern Catalonia).

The last actions in this theatre happened at the siege of Barcelona on 23 February; the French sallied out of Barcelona to test the besiegers&#x27; lines, as they thought (wrongly) that the Anglo-Sicilian forces had departed. They failed to break through the lines, and forces under the command of the Spanish General Pedro Sarsfield stopped them. The French General Pierre-Joseph Habert tried another sortie on 16 April and the French were again stopped with about 300 of them killed. Habert eventually surrendered on 25 April.

On 1 March Suchet received orders to send 10,000 more men to Lyons. On 7 March Beurmann&#x27;s division of 9,661 men left for Lyons. With the exception of Figueras, Suchet abandoned all the remaining fortresses in Catalonia that the French garrisoned (and that were not closely besieged by Allied forces), and in doing so was able to create a new field force of about 14,000 men, which were concentrated in front of Figueras in early April.

In the meantime, because the Allies underestimated the size of Suchet&#x27;s force and believed that 3,000 more men had left for Lyon and that Suchet, with the remnant of his army, was crossing the Pyrenees to join Soult in the Atlantic theatre, the Allies began to redeploy their forces. The best of the British forces in Catalonia were ordered to join Wellington&#x27;s army on the river Garonne in France. They left to do so on 31 March, leaving the Spanish to mop up the remaining French garrisons in Catalonia.

In fact, Suchet remained in Figueras with his army until after the amnesty signed by Wellington and Soult. He spent his time arguing with Soult that he had only 4,000 troops available to march (although his army numbered around 14,000) and that they could not march with artillery, so he could not assist Soult in his battles with Wellington. The military historian Sir Charles Oman puts this refusal to help Soult down to Suchet&#x27;s personal animosity rather than strong strategic reasons.

===Invasion of France===

====Battles of the Nivelle and the Nive====
On the night of 9 November 1813 Wellington brought up his right from the Pyrenean passes to the northward of Maya and towards the Nivelle. Marshal Soult&#x27;s army (about 79,000), in three entrenched lines, stretched from the sea in front of Saint-Jean-de-Luz along commanding ground to Amotz and thence, behind the river, to Mont Mondarrain near the Nive. Wellington on 10 November 1813 attacked and drove the French to Bayonne. The allied loss during the Battle of Nivelle was about 2,700; that of the French, 4,000, 51 guns, and all their magazines. The next day Wellington closed in upon Bayonne from the sea to the left bank of the Nive.

After this there was a period of comparative inaction, though during it the French were driven from the bridges at Urdains and Cambo-les-Bains. George Bell, a junior British officer in the 34th Foot during this period of inaction, told in his biography of an &quot;Irish sentry who was found with a French and an English musket on his two shoulders, guarding a bridge over a brook on behalf of both armies. For he explained to the officer going the rounds that his French neighbour had gone off on his behalf, with his last precious half-dollar, to buy brandy for both, and had left his musket in pledge till his return. The French officer going his rounds on the other side of the brook then turned up, and explained that he had caught his sentry, without arms and carrying two bottles, a long way to the rear. If either of them reported what had happened to their colonels, both sentries would be court-martialled and shot. Wherefore both subalterns agreed to hush up the matter&quot;. The weather had become bad, and the Nive unfordable; but there were additional and serious causes of delay. The Portuguese and Spanish authorities were neglecting the payment and supply of their troops. Wellington had also difficulties of a similar kind with his own government, and also the Spanish soldiers, in revenge for many French outrages, had become guilty of grave excesses in France, so that Wellington took the extreme step of sending 25,000 of them back to Spain and resigning the command of their army (though his resignation was subsequently withdrawn). So great was the tension at this crisis that a rupture with Spain seemed possible, but this did not happen.

Wellington occupied the right as well as the left bank of the Nive on 9 December 1813 with a portion of his force only under Rowland Hill and Beresford, Ustaritz and Cambo-les-Bains, his loss being slight, and thence pushed down the river towards Villefranque, where Soult barred his way across the road to Bayonne. The allied army was now divided into two portions by the Nive; and Soult from Bayonne at once took advantage of his central position to attack it with all his available force, first on the left bank and then on the right. Desperate fighting now ensued, but owing to the intersected ground, Soult was compelled to advance slowly, and Wellington coming up with Beresford from the right bank, the French retired baffled. Renewed French attacks on 13 December were also stopped. The losses in the four days&#x27; fighting in the battles before Bayonne (or battles of the Nive) were-Allies about 5,000, French about 7,000.

==1814==
Operation resumed on French soil in February 1814 and Wellington went quickly over to the offensive. Hill on 14 and 15 February, after a battle of Garris, drove the French posts beyond the Joyeuse; and Wellington then pressed these troops back over the Bidouze and Gave de Mauleon to the Gave d&#x27;Oloron. An amphibious landing with 8,000 troops at the mouth of the Adour secured a crossing over the river as a preliminary to the siege of Bayonne. On 27 February, Wellington attacked Soult at Orthez and forced him to retreat towards Saint-Sever, which he reached on 28 February. The allied loss was about 2,000; the French 4,000 and 6 guns. Beresford, with 12,000 men, was now sent to Bordeaux, which opened its gates as promised to the Allies. Driven by Hill from Aire-sur-l&#x27;Adour on 2 March 1814, Soult retired by Vic-en-Bigorre, where there was a combat (19 March), and Tarbes, where there was a severe action (20 March), to Toulouse behind the Garonne. He endeavored also to rouse the French peasantry against the Allies, but in vain, for Wellington&#x27;s justice and moderation afforded them no grievances.

===Battle of Toulouse===
On 8 April, Wellington crossed the Garonne and the Hers-Mort, and attacked Soult at Toulouse on 10 April. Spanish attacks on Soult&#x27;s heavily fortified positions were repulsed but Beresford&#x27;s assault compelled the French to fall back. On 12 April Wellington entered the city, Soult having retreated the previous day. The Allied loss was about 5,000, the French 3,000.

===Abdication of Napoleon===
On 13 April 1814 officers arrived with the announcement to both armies of the capture of Paris, the abdication of Napoleon, and the practical conclusion of peace; and on 18 April a convention, which included Suchet&#x27;s force, was entered into between Wellington and Soult. After Toulouse had fallen, the Allies and French, in a sortie from Bayonne on 14 April, each lost about 1,000 men, so that some 10,000 men fell after peace had virtually been made. The Peace of Paris was formally signed at Paris on 30 May 1814.

==Aftermath==

Ferdinand VII remained King of Spain having been acknowledged on 11 December 1813 by Napoleon in the Treaty of Valençay. The remaining &quot;afrancesados&quot; were exiled to France. The whole country had been pillaged by Napoleon&#x27;s troops. The Catholic Church had been ruined by its losses and society subjected to destabilizing change.

With Napoleon exiled to the island of Elba, Louis XVIII was restored to the French throne.

British troops were partly sent to England, and partly embarked at Bordeaux for America for service in the final months of the American War of 1812.

After the Peninsular War, the pro-independence traditionalists and liberals clashed in the Carlist Wars, as King Ferdinand VII (&quot;the Desired One&quot;; later &quot;the Traitor King&quot;) revoked all the changes made by the independent Cortes Generales in Cádiz, the Constitution of 1812 on 4 May 1814. Military officers forced Ferdinand to accept the Cádiz Constitution again in 1820, and was in effect until April 1823, during what is known as the Trienio Liberal.

The experience in self-government led the later &quot;Libertadores&quot; (Liberators) to promote the independence of Spanish America.

Portugal&#x27;s position was more favorable than Spain&#x27;s. Revolt had not spread to Brazil, there was no colonial struggle and there had been no attempt at political revolution. The Portuguese Court&#x27;s transfer to Rio de Janeiro initiated the independence of Brazil in 1822.

The war against Napoleon remains as one of the bloodiest events in Spain&#x27;s modern history.

<doc id="102486" wikidata="Q6525609" url="?curid=102486" title="Leonard P. Zakim">
<text>Leonard Paul Zakim (November 17, 1953 – December 2, 1999) was a Jewish American religious and civil rights leader in Boston. Zakim died in 1999 after a five-year battle with bone-marrow cancer. Boston&#x27;s Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge was named in his honor.

==Early life and education==
Zakim, nicknamed &quot;Lenny&quot;, was born in Clifton, New Jersey and became interested in civil rights and activism after he encountered anti-semitism as a boy. He earned his B.A. degree from American University in Washington, DC and his J.D. degree from the New England School of Law in 1978. He settled in the Boston area after law school and lived there until the end of his life. In 1978, he worked as the southeast Massachusetts field director for the reelection campaign of then Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. Paid $50 a week to work on the ultimately unsuccessful campaign, this experience nevertheless formed the cornerstone of his later political involvement. &quot;The campaign was the beginning of an association with Dukakis and his wife, Kitty, that would bring Zakim to the policy-making level of the national Democratic Party, a standing he retained after Dukakis&#x27;s political career faded,&quot; the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; wrote in its obituary on Zakim.

In 1979, he was hired by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) as its New England Civil Rights director and in 1984 he was named New England director for the organization. He and his wife Joyce had three children: Josh, Deena and Shari.

==Civil rights advocacy==
Zakim was also co-founder of A World of Difference Institute, an anti-bias educational project formed in Boston in 1986. The project has been adapted in 29 other cities and six counties.

Zakim and Rev. Charles Stith founded an annual Black-Jewish Seder in Boston which inspired many interfaith Seders with Catholic, Protestant and Jewish participants in Boston and nationally. At the time of his death it was the largest Black-Jewish seder in the USA. He also &quot;used his political connections and friendships with black ministers, Roman Catholic leaders and sports celebrities to establish community organizations and public-service events, including the 12,000-member Team Harmony antiracism rally for teenagers&quot;, the &quot;New York Times&quot; said in its obituary.

During the last years of his life, as he struggled with myeloma, he founded the Lenny Zakim Fund to fight poverty and racism in Boston. Shortly before his death, he organized a Catholic-Jewish pilgrimage to Rome with his friend Cardinal Bernard Law. There, he had an audience with Pope John Paul II, prompting the New Jersey native to say: &quot;I&#x27;ve had my picture taken with the Pope, Bruce Springsteen and the Dalai Lama. Now I&#x27;ve got to get the three of them together.&quot; He condemned the protest by gay rights and abortion rights activists outside the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston that disrupted an ordination of priests in 1990.

==Publications==
Zakim published several articles about the Middle East, Black-Jewish and Catholic-Jewish relations, anti-Semitism, violence and hate crimes. He wrote a Brandeis University publication about coalition building and &quot;Lift Up Your Voice&quot;, a book about race and religious relations released in 1998. He co-authored, with Janice Ditchek, &quot;Confronting Anti-Semitism: A Practical Guide&quot;.

==Political relationships==
Zakim served as a member of the Massachusetts Democratic State Committee. In addition to working on the gubernatorial and presidential election campaigns of Dukakis, he was a close advisor and good friend of Steven Grossman when Grossman was chairman of the Massachusetts Democratic Party and later the National Democratic Party.

His work in Boston revolved around his personal relationships. &quot;I am a firm believer that relationships count more than institutions&quot;, he said. &quot;It&#x27;s because you know someone that you start to care about their issues.&quot; In particular, his relationship with Cardinal Law was crucial. The men were friendly before Law became Cardinal. (Zakim traveled with the delegation to Rome when Law was elevated from archbishop). Upon returning to Boston in 1985, Law delivered his first sermon as cardinal on anti-semitism and the two men traveled to Poland together in 1986, where they visited the Auschwitz concentration camp and spoke to Catholic groups about anti-semitism.

==Honors==
For bringing together Catholics and Jews in Boston, he was honored with a Knighthood of St. Gregory from Pope John Paul II during his November, 1999 trip to Rome. Zakim also received the Urban League&#x27;s Community Service Award and the Catholic Charities Medal. He also received an honorary degree in humane letters from Brandeis University and numerous other awards for leadership in human rights.

The Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge, the Charles River crossing of Interstate 93 and US 1 completed in 2003 as part of the Big Dig (the Central Artery/Tunnel Project), was named in his honor.

The World Wide Web Consortium&#x27;s Zakim IRC bot is named &quot;in honor both of human rights advocate Lenny Zakim who gave voice to the people and the Zakim bridge across the Charles.&quot;
